{"title": "Paneer of Pettiness", "selftext": "I've gotten so many requests for this. I'm touched. :)\n\nThis is the paneer I make when I want to eat paneer tikka masala or saag paneer. If I want to make Gulab Jamun I make a different paneer.\n\n**You will need:**\n\nFull cream/Whole milk (1 gallon)\n\nLemon juice (1/2 cup)\n\nIce cubes (optional)\n\nCheesecloth\n\nColander/Strainer\n\nYou can halve the ingredients if you like.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\nBoil milk in pot with lid on. Continuously check on it to ensure that the milk does not burn. As the milk starts to boil add the lemon juice and stir. It should start curdling immediately and don\u2019t worry if it changes colour slightly. Yellow/green discoloration is common. Keep stirring so it doesn\u2019t stick to the pot. After it is completely curdled, turn off the heat and allow the mixture to sit and cool for 5-10 minutes. You can add ice cubes to make the cooling process faster, but it isn't necessary.\n\nWhile it cools, take cheesecloth, line the strainer with it and place it over a large bowl. Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth. The whey (liquid) should strain into the bowl. The curds should remain in the cheesecloth.\n\nGather the cheesecloth in your hands and rinse under running cold water. Then gently squeeze to get rid of liquid from the curds. Knot the cheesecloth with the curds in it at the top and hang it from your faucet to let it drain into the sink further for 20-30 minutes. Then place it on a plate, untie the knot on the cheesecloth and lay it flat over the curd. Place another plate on top of the curd. Place another heavy object on the plate. I generally stack plates on the curd and put a small sack of rice/large bottle of oil on top to weigh it down. Let it be for an hour or so. Cut it up and use immediately or put it in the fridge. I recommend putting it into the fridge immediately. It really helps to firm it up. Done!\n\nThis is probably really similar to some of the recipes already on the internet. This is my first time writing a recipe so I hope it\u2019s clear enough! Don\u2019t get discouraged if your first time doesn\u2019t turn out as well as you want it to.

It is *delicious* and my go-to comfort food. I would kill to be able to adequately cook it at home, but unfortunately I don\u2019t have the magic (or the knowledge) so the local Indian spots receive my money quite often. \n\nYour MIL is *nuts* for passing up the chance to enjoy your cooking. I\u2019ll be trying out your recipe, but I almost hope I fail, because if I unlock the ability to make quality paneer at home, it is OVER for any weight loss plans I have."]}
{"title": "Irish stew with soda bread good enough to make my MIL mad at me.", "selftext": "Posted about this recipe quite a bit now, after it caused in-law related drama over on JustNoMIL, which has ended with MIL being on an indefinite time out. Enough people asked me about it that I thought I'd share here. I did some thinking and the woman who gave me this recipe, my Nanny Maureen, would be alright with me sharing her recipe here, but not her secret ingredient, so here's the recipe for a nearly perfect Irish stew, as I'm afraid Nanny Maureen would come back to life and kill me for sharing the secret.\n\nDisclaimer: Measurements aren't exact but I can take some guesses, and most is according to what your taste is. Carrots are used here but aren't necessary, and can be switched out with whatever veg you want, or no veg at all. I'm told you can just buy lamb stock so feel free, but the recipe includes making your own. I highly recommend the recipe as it is, though, but that's probably because I grew up with it.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* A few lamb necks and some lamb shoulder or rump (making friends with your local butcher is not necessary, but strongly encouraged). You can just make the whole thing with neck if you want, but I prefer to get a few different cuts. It depends on how much stew you're making, but you'll want around 1 neck per litre of water.\n* Bag of potatoes (I prefer red but Nanny always used King Edward)\n* Carrots and onions (when I asked how many she always said \"you'll know\" so it's however many feels right to you on a spiritual level).\n* Pinch of thyme, a bit of celery (I never use more than half a stick but I don't like celery), a bay leaf, a few sprigs of parsley and a dash of pepper. Chives to be used at your discretion.\n* Equal amounts of wholemeal and plain flour, and 1.5x buttermilk (when nan taught me it was about 200g of each flour and 300ml of buttermilk, although she measured it with a pint glass), sprinkle of salt, pinch of bicarbonate of soda.\n\nTo make the stock- Separate the bones from the neck and chuck them in a pot of water, along with 1 sliced carrot, 1 diced onion, and herbs and let it simmer on a low-ish heat for a few hours. For best results let it sit overnight, but this isn't necessary. Sieve it and chuck out the solid bits, so you just have the liquid left, then heat it to reduce it. (I always make more than I'll need because this can be freezed for a few months and saves me making it again)\n\nFor the stew - heat the stock until it's just shy of boiling, chop up what's left of the lamb meat (neck, shoulder, rump, whatever), and seal it off in a saucepan before putting it in the stock. Reduce heat, simmer and cover for about 15 mins. Chop up remaining potatoes, carrots, and onion, then add all that plus the seasonings to the stock. Just go for it with the seasoning, add all you want, but for the love of all that is Holy, taste as you go (I've seen too many people fuck up at this stage by bunging in too much to start off with). More simmering until the lamb is cooked through. Then take it off the heat and cover, don't stir again until serving. It lasts a couple days and if you keep it in the fridge you can reheat it, but be reasonable.\n\nFor the bread - put all the dry stuff in a bowl, gradually add buttermilk, stirring as you go with a fork until it looks like bread dough. If it's too sticky add either flour, too dry add a splash of normal cow milk, but if you need more than that then use the buttermilk, it just needs to look like dough. Knead it, but only a little (really easy to overdo it but you still need to knead it a bit). Roll into a ball-shaped loaf, cut a cross on the top, bake for half an hour on about 200C/400F. There's no yeast so there's no rising time, and you can make it while the stew is simmering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd there you go. It's not particularly difficult but there's a lot of technical stuff (especially the bread) and most of the cooking time is just waiting for it to simmer.\n\nSl\u00e1inte!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/cndbw0/irish_stew_with_soda_bread_good_enough_to_make_my/", "created_utc": 1565220079.0, "score": 694, "author": "None", "num_comments": 114, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/cndbw0/irish_stew_with_soda_bread_good_enough_to_make_my/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Hope you didn't give the racist cuntbag anything.", "Thank you.

As soon as the sugar starts to melt, use a heat-proof spatula to move it constantly around the pan \u2014 you want it all to melt and caramelize easily. Cook until a deep amber, 3-5 minutes. Once the caramel is all melted, remove from heat and stir in the nuts. Immediately pour onto sheet pan and spread as thin as possible. Work quickly, as it will begin to set in less than a minute.  \n Let cool completely.\n\nBreak the brittle in a zip top plastic bag with a rolling pin or meat grinder or break into pieces and pulse in a food processor until the size of short-grain rice. Store in an air-tight container, and use remaining brittle from this recipe within a month.\n\n**Peanut Butter Cookies**\n\nIngredients:\n\n\u00b7 12 Tbsp (1.5 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n\n\u00b7 1 1/2 cups sugar\n\n\u00b7 1/4 cup glucose1 syrup (use 2 Tbsp corn syrup in a pinch, *but the consistency will be compromised*)\n\n\u00b7 1 cup creamy peanut butter\n\n\u00b7 2 eggs\n\n\u00b7 1/8 tsp vanilla extract\n\n\u00b7 1 1/3 cup or 225g **bread** flour \n\n\u00b7 1/2 tsp baking powder\n\n\u00b7 1/8 tsp baking soda\n\n\u00b7 2 1/4 tsp kosher salt\n\n\u00b7 1/2 recipe peanut brittle\n\n1. Cream together: \n\n\u00b7 butter \n\n\u00b7 sugar \n\n\u00b7 glucose \n\nin the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. \n\n2. Fold in:\n\n\u00b7 peanut butter\n\n\u00b7 eggs\n\n\u00b7 vanilla \n\nand beat for 30 seconds on medium-high speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and then paddle on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. During this time, the sugar granules will dissolve, and the creamed mixture will double in size.\n\n3. Separately, mix all dry ingredients:\n\n\u00b7 flour \n\n\u00b7 baking powder \n\n\u00b7 baking soda\n\n\u00b7 salt \n\nSlowly add the dry mix to the creamed mixture just until the dough comes together, and the dry ingredients have just combined into the wet; no longer than 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.\n\n4. Fold in the peanut brittle until incorporated, no more than 30 seconds.\n\n5. Using a 1.5 oz ice cream scoop, portion out the dough onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Pat the tops of the cookie domes flat. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 week. As with any butter-based cookie, do *not* bake your cookies from room temperature \u2013 they will not hold shape faster than they bake.\n\n6. Heat the oven to 375\u00b0. Arrange the chilled dough at least 4 inches apart on parchment or Silpat lined sheets. Bake for 18 minutes. The cookies will puff, crackle and spread. Bake until tan with auburn specks throughout. Cool completely on sheet pans before transferring to a plate or an airtight container for storage. At room temperature, cookies will keep fresh for 5 days, or 1 month if frozen.\n\n*Footnote:*\n\n*1* Glucose: Never used glucose before? You\u2019ve surely eaten it. It\u2019s in most commercially produced sweets as it\u2019s more shelf-stable and cheaper than most sweetening agents. \u2018Glucose\u2019 is typically pointing at glucose syrup from grapes, not corn syrup, so read the container before purchasing.

You want the mayo mixture to barely coat the potatoes. And don't worry if mixing smushes the potatoes a bit. It just makes it better. \n\nSeason with celery salt, salt, and a dash of pepper. (Don't try to season to taste because the flavors haven't melded yet. Just judge by eye and make minor adjustments just before serving.) \n\nWipe down the edges of the bowl (where you've smeared the mayo over everything), cover, and chill overnight. \n\nBefore serving, taste and adjust the seasonings.

My DH just calls the spaghetti I made \u201cgourmet.\u201d I don\u2019t really measure my ingredients, so I\u2019m mostly estimating. \n\nI had a few requests for the recipe, so here it is!\n\nIngredients:\n16 oz thin spaghetti \n1lb ground chuck 80% lean\n2 jars of four cheese pasta sauce \n4-5 garlic cloves \n10 (or so) mushrooms\n2 onions \n2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n2 tbsp butter\nGrated parmesan cheese\nOlive oil \nSalt and pepper\nPinch of sugar\n2tsp Italian spice mix\n\nI start by heating water in a large pot for the noodles. Add a peeled whole onion and a dash of olive oil to the water. Place the butter in a large sauce pan and set to low/medium heat. Next chop up a little less than half an onion and all the mushrooms into tiny pieces. Like half an inch-ish? You should have about a cup and a half of mushrooms and less than a cup of onions. \nCut the garlic up into tiny pieces. Add the veggies and garlic into the melted butter with a dash of salt and pepper. While that\u2019s slowly cooking, stir occasionally, put the ground beef in a bowl and add salt, pepper, and like 2 tsp of the Italian spices. Mix it up. Then wash your hands!\nOnce the onions become semi transparent add the beef to the pan. Stir it up. By this time your water should be boiling. Add the noodles and stir it up too. The noodles take about 8-10 minutes. You don\u2019t want them too mushy. We like them al dente.

The mushy onion is no longer needed. (But can be composted!)\nTransfer the meat mixture to the now empty big pot, on super low heat. Pour in one jar of pasta sauce and that pinch of sugar.

So that when it\u2019s reheated in a microwave it will still be saucy. )\nI sprinkle in the mozzarella so that it gets all melty and delicious.

Start with it on the hob, you'll want it on a low heat as the marshmallows take a while to melt but you also don't want to burn the arse off them. Use your stick or spoon to stab through to the bottom and if you come away with melted marshmallow on it then you're good.\n3. Stick it in the grill to finish it off, which should toast the marshmallows on top, puff them up and give them a golden brown colour.\n4. Serve with biscuits of your choice (I use plain digestives or rich tea).\n5. If you're my mother in law, proceed to complain about how unhealthy it is and throw it in the bin, but make sure you miss the bin entirely when you do it, leaving your daughter in law to clean up a mess of melted chocolate and marshmallow on the floor.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: When cleaning the pan, empty it while it's still warm because that will pour out easily, and if it gets too cool then it'll stick and you'll have to scrub it off.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/co865u/smores_dip/", "created_utc": 1565383086.0, "score": 300, "author": "None", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/co865u/smores_dip/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This sounds like its be great with a simple chocolate ganache and then the marshmallows.

We are (hopefully) getting all of that cleared up at the moment, but below is the recipe for the potatoes, which are delicious whether you use my mom's or my girlfriend's method.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRECIPE FOR POTLUCK POTATOES:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2lb package frozen cubed potatoes, thawed (GF used fresh potatoes, diced to small pieces)\n* 1 can cream of chicken soup\n* 2c shredded cheddar cheese (GF used an aged English cheddar that we really like)\n* 1/2c melted butter\n* 1 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp pepper (GF eyeballed these, and added 1 tbsp McCormack's All-Purpose \"Crushed Red Pepper, Oregano, and Garlic\" seasoning)\n* 1/2c chopped onions (GF used one whole white onion, and saut\u00e9ed it with four cloves of garlic (chopped) before adding to the mixture)\n* 2c sour cream\n* GF added 8oz garlic & herb flavored goat cheese -- she uses [this](https://www.meijer.com/shop/en/deli/specialty-cheese/goat/meijer-garlic-herb-goat-cheese-log-4-oz-/p/71928327351) brand but she says our grocery store is regional, so it won't be available everywhere\n\nIngredients for topping:\n\n* 1 1/4c crushed corn flakes (GF used potato chips instead of corn flakes)\n* 1/4c melted butter\n* GF added 1/8c finely chopped oregano)\n\nPrep:\n\nButter the sides and bottom of a 9x13\" baking or casserole dish (GF recommends clear glass so you can see the cheese to gauge when the casserole is ready)\n\nCombine all ingredients (excluding topping ingredients) in a large bowl and mix well\n\n(GF says, for the goat cheese, to crumble or finely dice it and mix it in alongside everything else)\n\nCombine topping ingredients and spread over casserole\n\nBake @ 350F for 45-60 minutes, until potatoes are tender and cheese is melted\n\nIf topping browns too quickly, cover with foil and continue baking until ready", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/ec75h0/my_girlfriends_updatedimproved_version_of_potluck/", "created_utc": 1576640499.0, "score": 215, "author": "proposalguy17", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/ec75h0/my_girlfriends_updatedimproved_version_of_potluck/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Without all the changes, we call these \u201cthe good potatoes\u201d in my family.

Oh and more cheese, can never have too much cheese.

{"title": "Petty and don't care: the potatoes dish Slurrsula wants and can't have.", "selftext": "My grandmother had a \"gay friend\" (her words for him all the time, he was just a token) who was a chef. He's since passed away but he taught me this one between when he got sick and when he died in about 2012. \n\nNow, I don't remember what this is really called. This is not a \"low fat\" dish in any kind of way. This is filling, heavy, \"pass out with your pants unzipped\" comfort food. The name in English that I was taught was \"Vintner's Potatoes\" but I can't find anything online or anywhere else that goes into specifics about where it's from or whatever. \n\nI'm thinking of calling this version \"CBF Potatoes\" because 1) I'm not following the original recipe super close anyway and 2) I caught her in the act of *trying to steal my bacon*. (She takes and eats our food all the time, but only the expensive stuff like meat and dairy products because \"she's keto\". Idk how bourbon is keto but not my problem. Bitch tried to steal my bacon, though, and that's not fuckin' cool.) Anyway, the CBF when an entire POUND of bacon was taken out of the fridge (where she was thawing it to cook and eat all by herself instead of for the recipe I HAD planned for Thanksgiving, but fuck it!) to go into this dish was AMAZING. \n\nSo here goes: \n\nIngredients:\n\nA pound of sliced bacon\n\n2 pounds of white or yellow potatoes, sliced thin\n\n2 pounds of white/soft cheese, shredded or sliced thin\n\na white or yellow onion, sliced thin\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nA deep oven-safe pot with a lid (Le Crueset, Pyrex, cast iron, etc.) \n\n\nStep one is to preheat the oven to 350*F/180*C/Gasmark 4. \n\nOpen the bacon, separate the slices, and line the pot it with it. (Obviously if you need to season new cast iron, this is a good option. That's why he taught me this one; he'd bought me a cast iron set.) The trick is to line the bacon up so that the entire bottom of the vessel is covered, so some need to be staggered away from the center of the pan. Strips run up the sides and flop over the edge for now. If there are enough slices, leave a few for the top. \n\nToday's cheese concoction is a mix of Muenster, Mozzarella, Swiss, and Pepper Jack. If you have the mixer attachment that shreds cheese easily, use it! Soft cheeses shred or cut more easily if they're cool to cold, so I stick them in the freezer for 15 min or so before I start working on it. I usually just use whatever different kinds I have in the fridge/freezer/caught on sale at Aldi. \n\nYou start with a layer of potato slices on top of the bacon in the dutch oven. Put a few slices of onions on top of that, then salt and fresh ground pepper, then just cover the potato slices with shredded cheese. Then repeat those layers (cheese and onion slices, salt and pepper, mixed up cheeses) until you're 1/2 an inch or 1 cm from the top of the pot. That last bit of space is for the bacon slices to get folded down over the potatoes. If you saved a couple slices, lay them across the top of the stacked potatoes/onions/cheese. (You may need to tooth pick them into place so they don't just curl off the top as it starts to cook. Leave a bit of the picks sticking out so you don't accidentally serve them to somebody once it's cut.)\n\nLid goes on. Into the oven it goes. Bake for *at least* 45 minutes until the potatoes are just cooked through at the center. (Probe thermometer should hit 165* at the center b/c you're working with pork.) \n\nThen you take your lid off and let the bacon on top brown. (It's going to roll. Don't fret too much.) Cut the heat and pull the casserole out. Use oven mitts and a good knife to slice down into the potato stack and a cake server to scoop it. All that cheese + the water and starch in the potatoes + the fat from the bacon and the cheese makes kind of a sauce for the potatoes to soak up. \n\nThe potatoes that the bacon stealing pain in my ass \"can't\" eat. :) \n\nTaking bets that she'll go for the leftovers after we go to bed tonight since the *entire* house smells like bacon... if her son and I leave any leftovers. :)\n\nThis was supposed to be for Thanksgiving w/ BroInLaw and SisInLaw, but the bitch tried to steal my bacon. No worries, though; I won't make anything \"Keto\" for that dinner either.

{"title": "Revenge Nog (by request)", "selftext": "I am happy to share my Revenge Nog recipe!  It takes a bit of practice not to wind up with egg custard but either way this is delicious.  Makes about 5 big cupfuls.\n\n(\"Past Mistakes Molly\" will be adding her own asides in parentheses.)\n\nHalf dozen eggs\n\n1 cup sugar\n\n2 cups heavy whipping cream\n(Do not skimp on this. Do not use anything else.)\n\n2 cups whole fat (must be whole!) milk\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\n2 tablespoons nutmeg\n\n3 tablespoons cinammon\n\n2 whole cloves\n\n1.5 cups brandy or rum.  I very much recommend Buttershots, or Honeybee.  Make sure you like the taste of the alcohol before you add it to the nog!  If you go non-alcoholic, skip the extra cup of cream at the end.\n\nSeparate the egg yolks from the whites.  Easiest way is to break everything into a bowl and just pick up the yolks with a clean hand.  We'll be using the yolks right now, so put the whites in a bowl with plastic wrap and set it in the fridge.\n\nPut the yolks in a big metal bowl (it gets cold faster and won't break if you add heat).\n\nWhisk (not stir!  Not blend!  Whisk!  Fork and spoon don't work!) the yolks until there are no egg \"stringies\" left (ew).  The yolks should look a lighter yellow now.  Strain it through a cheesecloth to get even more \"stringies\" out.\n\nAdd the sugar to the egg yolks, keep whisking away until the sugar is completely mixed in and no granules can be seen.  Now set that aside.\n\nPour the milk, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt into a saucepan. Scald that sucker - bring it to a boil and then take it off the heat while (NEVER STOP STIRRING OMG) pouring in the cream.  Let it get to a soft simmer - tiny bubbles like an elf drowning.\n\nNow the hard part.  Take a small ladleful of the hot cream and add it to the eggs WHILE whisking the everloving shit out of the eggs.  (Otherwise you will end up with custard or sickly sweet scrambled eggs!)  Keep adding a ladleful at a time while whisking those eggs.  The heat is cooking them.  If you do manage to curdle you might be able to save your creation by straining it with  a cheesecloth again.\n\nWhen the saucepan is empty you need to keep whisking until the mixture starts to get thick.  You'll know it's ready when it coats the back of a spoon.  When that happens, cover it TIGHT with plastic wrap (not a lid) and put it in the fridge (with a potholder or towel underneath to protect your fridge shelf from the heat).\n\nKeep it in the fridge until the metal bowl is cold to the touch.  It will get thicker as it cools.\n\nThen - but only if you can manage to keep it away from someone drinking it -\n\nAdd nutmeg and cloves.  Pour in the brandy a bit at a time, stirring constantly.  \n\nWhisk the egg whites, until it gets to where it sticks up by itself.  Fold it into the mixture, dragging a big spoon from the bottom to the top over the whites. Whip the other cup of cream until it gets to where it stands up by itself.  Fold that into the mixture too.  Stir slowly and carefully until everything looks smooth.\n\nThis shit is CRaZY THICK and CRaZY good.\n\nRemember that Revenge Nog is a dish best served cold!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/a7c37c/revenge_nog_by_request/", "created_utc": 1545147372.0, "score": 202, "author": "pissedoffmolly", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/a7c37c/revenge_nog_by_request/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["\"Like an elf drowning\" \n\nPlease write a cookbook ", "My mother used to make this for Christmas every year, with rum on the side cuz I like the nog without the rum.\n\nIf you have two cups, you do not have to eat until the next day, it is rich and decadent and very filling!!\n\nI miss the nog, mom-not so much!\n\nThanks for the recipe!

{"title": "German Christmas gingerbread cake (Weihnachts Lebkuchen)", "selftext": "My family's Christmas lebkucken cake recipe. Usually you find lebkucken in cookie form, but this elevates it to cake form. This is the recipe my ex-MIL desperately wanted but never got (the full recipe of). She was the type to never give out the correct recipe for her cookies so they'd never come out the same when not baked by her. Now that she's out of my life, I am damn happy she never got my family recipe. But all of you fine redditors will!\n\nFirst... this is not your typical coffee-house gingerbread or what comes out of a pillsbury gingerbread box mix. It is not mild. It is dark, chewy, heavy, spicy, and will fill up your house with the smell of Christmas. This is like the flourless chocolate cake of gingerbread cake. This is for those are into, or curious about, old-school intense gingerbread cakes. It will only get better with time too...a couple days after baking the flavors keep merging together.\n\nThe batter can be put into a 10inch bundt cake pan (*heavily* floured beforehand), a tall 8in cake pan (parchment lined), or into a couple loaf pans. I prefer to bake in a cake pan so I can decorate the top with icing and a couple of sprigs of rosemary to look like little evergreen trees. Icing can be simple powdered sugar icing glaze or something like cream cheese frosting. Whatever you think would taste good with a spiced cake. **see very bottom for an extra idea**\n \n**Wet ingredients:**\n\n3 large eggs\n\n3/4 cup vegetable oil (such as canola or rapeseed oil, do not not use peanut oil or olive oil)\n\n1 cup very dark beer (if you can find it, use a german Schwarzbier [k\u00f6stri\u00dfer or Krombacher Dark] if you can't, use a dark stout like Guinness)\n\n1 cup dark molasses (not blackstrap because that's too bitter. If you have access to Rapunzel brand Zuckerrohrmelase, get that. Grandma brand green label dark molasses is a good sub in US stores.)\n\n**Dry ingredients:**\n\n1/2 Tablespoon baking soda\n\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n\n1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar (do not substitute light brown)\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n1.5 teaspoons baking powder (double acting)\n\n**Spices (if possible, use coffee/spice grinder to grind spices fresh):**\n\n2 tablespoons ground ginger (yes, tablespoons)\n\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n1/2 teaspoon ground or grated nutmeg \n\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground green cardamom\n\n1/8 teaspoon ground Allspice \n\n1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger (or 1/4 cup minced crystalized ginger)\n\nIf you want to be crazy, like my Oma sometimes would be, add in a 1/2 cup of crushed nuts like walnuts or pecans. And put in both crystalized ginger and 1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger.\n\n\n**Directions:**\n\nPreheat oven to 350degF, or 325degF convection. Put rack in middle of oven.\n\nButter a loaf pan or cake pan... line the bottom and sides with parchment and grease the parchment with butter as well. All the molasses will make this sticky! Use a true 9in\u00d75in loaf or two smaller loaf pans. Use a  8in cake pan with tall sides. Or butter and heavily flour a 6-cup 10inch Bundt pan.\n\nIn a large saucepan over high heat, combine the stout and molasses and bring to a boil.  *Keep stirring during the heating!!* Turn off the heat, take saucepan off heat, and add the baking SODA.  Whisk in baking soda quickly and let sit until the foam dissipates; this takes about 10 minutes. Let it cool to room temperature.\n\nIn the meantime, whisk together eggs and both sugars in a big bowl.  Then whisk in the oil. In another bowl, combine the rest of the dry ingredients- flour, ground ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom (nuts IF desired). But NOT the fresh ginger yet.\n\nCombine the room temperature stout mixture with the egg mixture. Whisk it together. Then add this liquid into the flour mixture, half at a time, whisking to combine.  Add the fresh ginger and stir to combine.\n\nPour the batter into your pan of choice and bake for 60-70min in your 350 degree oven, or until the top springs back when gently pressed.  *Do not open the oven until the gingerbread is almost done, or the center may cave in a bit. Wait until 55min to check cake.*  You can use a toothpick to check doneness by inserting the toothpick into the middle of the cake. It's done if you only seeing a couple crumbs stuck to the toothpick. If it comes out with undercooked batter on the tip, leave in oven for 10 min increments till the toothpick comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\n\nThis is very tasty served still slightly warm, dusted with powdered sugar, and served with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Alternatively if you want to decorate, let the cake cool completely before topping with your choice of icing and decorations. \n\nThe pandemic will be making holidays this year different, but I hope a warm and cozy smelling cake will give you some cheer and well-needed Gem\u00fctlichkeit.\n\nEdit: I got an interesting question about how to gussy up the cake to taste like dominosteine. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar, dominosteine are like german petit-fours.... except it's a square with layers of lebkucken/a tart cherry-berry jelly/marzipan then covered in dark chocolate. I love the idea of adding the flavor of the marzipan/chocolate/berry jelly!! \n\nI'd say that this cake is too moist to make dominostein out of it, BUT it could be fun to do the following: add a disk layer of rolled out marzipan to the top of the cake (if made in a round cake pan).

{"title": "My MIL's Meatballs (Neapolitan)", "selftext": "**Polpetti** \n\nThis is a true JustNo Recipe, because it's one that I asked my JustNo for!\n\nOnce upon a time, 21 year old me asked my MIL for her meatball recipe (polpetti in Italian). She agreed and I was happy to share that experience with her, but what I didn't know was that she left out steps and ingredients. My meatballs fell apart, my sauce wasn't the right consistency, and I was disappointed after I realized it wasn't me; she just didn't give me the whole recipe. It took me about six months and three tries to get it right. Having worked it out, I now feel that this recipe is mine to dole out freely. I wrote it for a kitchen novice, like I was. Please enjoy. \n\nFrom what I understand, my MIL's polpetti are of the Neapolitan (Naples) variety. These particular ones have two ingredients I would never have thought to use in meatballs on my own, but they are delicious in polpetti: raisins and pignoli (pine nuts, pronounced pin-yoli). These have become our special occasion \"traditional\" fancy meatballs. When I make meatballs on the reg, I don't use the pignoli or raisins. I might add other spices, I may stuff them with mozzarella, I can add sausage, there are endless things you can do to meatballs! \n\nThis is basically an all-day event. One batch of meatballs (approx 12-15 meatballs) takes two hours to cook at minimum, and I always make two batches using one pound of beef. I only have one really big sauce pot, so I have to do it twice. The diameter of my pot accommodates about a dozen polpetti. The thing about meatballs is, you can only put ONE layer of them in the pot, otherwise they break up horribly and it just turns into meat sauce. Meat sauce is delicious but that isn't the goal here. So, I make one batch while some uncooked meatballs sit in a Tupperware in my fridge, and when the first batch is done, I take them out and cook the second batch. You can use two pots if you have them and cook all of the meatballs simultaneously! But be warned you will then be making two batches of sauce, requiring you to double the sauce ingredients (but not the meatball ingredients).\n\nPreparation: \n\nI am a big, BIG fan of mise en place. This is just a fancy term for reading the whole recipe, laying out all of your equipment, doing all of your dicing and chopping, and laying out your ingredients before you get started. Not only does it keep you from getting overwhelmed and running around your kitchen like a maniac, but it tells you if you're missing anything before you start. \n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb of ground beef 20% fat\n\nYou can use leaner beef if you want, but I find that the fat helps bind everything together so your meatballs don't break up in the pot. One pound yields approx 24 meatballs. \n\n* \u00bd Vidalia onion, diced\n* 2-3 tbsp olive oil, the regular stuff (not extra virgin)\n* 1 xl egg\n* 1 loaf day-old semolina bread: 2 cups of little little pieces (w/o crust) for meatballs, the rest for eating with your meatballs and sauce\n* \u00bc cup golden raisins, finely chopped\n* \u00bc cup pignoli, roughly chopped \n* 3 (32oz) cans crushed tomatoes with basil, Tuttorosso is my brand\n* 5 + 1 pieces garlic, minced (5 for sauce, 1 for meat)\n* A splash of whole milk\n* \u00bd box pasta of your choice\n* Grated pecorino romano\n\nIf you have fresh spices more power to you, that is completely awesome, however I rarely do\n\n* Basil\n* Salt\n* White pepper\n* Red pepper\n\nEquipment:\n\n* 1 very large pot for sauce. I'm talking elbow deep, minimum\n* 1 medium pot for pasta\n* Colander\n* Silicone spatula (suuuuuper highly recommended)\n* Ladle \n* Garlic press\n* Large mixing bowl\n* Chef's knife\n\nThe semolina bread:\n\nThe end result you want is 2 cups of little little pieces of bread, no crusts. You'll have to slice more if you have a skinny loaf. Tear up by hand. Stale bread is great for making meatballs! I eat the crusts as I'm cooking, dipping them in seasoned olive oil.\n\nDicing an onion:\n\nChef Gordon Ramsay has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGS067s0zo) on YouTube where he teaches you how you properly dice an onion, and it really enriched my whole life. He doesn't even yell at you or anything. \ud83d\ude02\n\nMincing garlic:\n\nI use the flat of my chef's knife to crush the pieces of garlic, so the papery outer layer pops right off. Then I just jam it right in the garlic press. Best invention ever. \n\nDirections:\n\n1. Get your sauce pot ready. In the list of ingredients, I wrote that you'll need 2-3 tbsp of olive oil. The amount is going to vary a little depending on the pot size. You want to cover the bottom of the pot in \u00bc inch of olive oil. This not only cooks your onion, it prevents your sauce from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pot. Get a good layer of oil in there, and then toss in your diced onion and five of your six total pieces of minced garlic. Coat in a nice heavy layer of salt, and cook on medium heat until translucent, stirring occasionally.\n2. When onions are translucent, add 3 32oz cans of diced tomatoes. Fill up one of the cans \u00be of the way with water, and add the water to the pot as well. Stir and bring to a boil. \n3. While that pot is working on boiling, prepare your meatballs. First, add your bread bits to your mixing bowl. Cover them with just a splash of whole milk. Start slow, you can always add milk but you can't take it out once it's in there. You don't want your bread to disintegrate, but you do want it to be soggy, and all of the milk should be absorbed leaving none at the bottom of the bowl. Squish it together with your hands until all the bread bits are the same level of soggy. Try not to overhandle the bread too much because you're going to keep touching it. \n4. Next, add the ground beef. Mush the beef and bread together with your hands, evenly dispersing the bread bits throughout the beef. [Cup your hand, and see the center of your palm where it forms a tiny bowl](https://imgur.com/a/IUDzZm4). Fill that little part of your hand with salt, then add to mixture. Crack your egg and add it, mixing it in with your hands until it is fully incorporated. Your egg and bread are the \"glue\" that's going to hold your meatballs together when they're cooking. \n5. Next, add the chopped raisins, pignoli, and the last (one) piece of minced garlic. Once the mixture is relatively even, form your mass of mush into polpetti. [Make a circle using your pointer finger and thumb](https://imgur.com/a/IUDzZm4). Your meatballs should be only slightly larger than the middle of your finger circle. Gently separate off sections of beef mixture and roll them round between your palms, applying only light pressure. Set them aside on a plate. \n6. Once your sauce is boiling turn your heat down to low and give it a nice stir. Really scrape the bottom of your pot with the silicone spatula, all the way around the sides, the center, everything. This is the last time you get to freely stir this pot before you have to dance around a bunch of meatballs you're trying not to break up. When adding spices, pour them into your hand first for caution. You can always add more spices, but you cannot take them out. Add your salt, pepper, and basil to taste. I think my MIL adds rosemary, but my fianc\u00e9 hates rosemary.\n7. Add the meatballs in a single layer. They're going to sit at the bottom of the pot when cooking, and the only thing above them should be sauce. Put the other meatballs in a container and refrigerate. Bring the pot back to a boil, simmer five minutes, and then you can (gently) scrape the bottom of your sauce pot with the silicone spatula again, delicately bumping your meatballs out of the way while you scrape the pot. Scraping the pot like this is essential, otherwise you will have a very hard to clean pot later. \n8. Cook two hours simmering on low, stirring carefully and periodically. You'll want to cover the pot, but put the lid on askew so the steam can still escape through a small slit. \n9. When your meatballs have fifteen minutes left, start making some pasta. Don't forget to bring the pasta to a rolling boil before starting the cook time on the package. Salt your pasta water after you add the pasta. \n10. You now have meatballs, sauce, bread, and grated cheese to eat! \n11. I put the second batch of meatballs in the pot before I eat up. I really scrape that pot with the silicone spatula between batches. I take out the cooked meatballs, leave the sauce, and then add the uncooked meatballs and the two hour cook time starts all over again.\n\nMy favorite thing to do with leftover meatballs is make meatball subs! Any leftover sauce can be frozen almost in perpetuity.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/gfz9ue/my_mils_meatballs_neapolitan/", "created_utc": 1588964541.0, "score": 136, "author": "teaandmiddlefingers", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/gfz9ue/my_mils_meatballs_neapolitan/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Right out of the Marie Barone playbook.

This sounds like a lot, but casseroles are typically sturdy enough to provide leftovers the next day.  Also, if you use the right ingredients, you only need a simple green vegetable or salad, or some fruit, on the side to make a complete meal.\n\nSo what goes into the casserole?  Follow this formula: Pick two or more of the following categories: a protein item, a grain/starch, a vegetable.  Grease your pan with whatever fat you usually use for the purpose.  Cut one or more items from each of your chosen categories into small bite-size pieces if necessary, or shred them.  Combine in the pan with a binding sauce (gravy, cheese sauce, white sauce, condensed canned soup, tomato sauce, whatever) and top with an optional topping (cheese, buttered crumbs, unbaked U.S. biscuits, cornbread batter, thinly sliced buttered bread with the butter side up, etc.).  Bake at 350 to 400 degrees F. until bubbly and nicely browned.  If not using the topping, cover tightly before baking to prevent scorching.\n\nIf American whiteness is a culture, I just described its national dish.  \n\nA breakfast casserole is, more or less, what I just described, except that you put it together the night before, cover the surface with plastic wrap, and refrigerate, then take off the plastic wrap and pop the casserole into the oven the next morning.  Breakfast casseroles are typically bound with savory custard (milk, beaten egg, and seasoning to taste), which seeps into all the crevices overnight and creates a kind of sturdy quiche or frittata sort of thing.\n\nEverybody has their own casserole.  Here are some general breakfast casserole ideas:\n\nProtein: Precook all meats.  Bacon, loose pork sausage, cut up breakfast links (these are about the size of a finger), ground pork or ground beef picadillo, city (heat-and-eat) ham, cubed cream cheese (this is a stiff spreadable cheese), shredded Cheddar cheese of desired age.\n\nVegetable: Think sturdy veggies that go well with the above proteins.  Sauteed onions, canned sliced mushrooms, cooked broccoli, spinach, canned or sauteed peppers of desired heat.\n\nStarch: Freshly made or frozen hash browns (individual portions of shredded potato), U.S. biscuit dough snipped into pieces, cubed wheat bread or cornbread.\n\nBind With: The savory custard mixture seasoned to harmonize with the other ingredients, or for a super rich casserole try a condensed cream soup thinned with cream or sour cream.  (Serve small portions of that!)\n\nTopping: Typically this is cheese or biscuits for a breakfast casserole.  If there's already a lot of grated cheese in the mixture, you can leave this off.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/a0qb2a/breakfast_casseroles_that_make_jnmils_mad/", "created_utc": 1543285093.0, "score": 122, "author": "None", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/a0qb2a/breakfast_casseroles_that_make_jnmils_mad/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["And if your casserole dish is made of glass please PLEASE let it sit at room temp for about an hour before you bake.

{"title": "My Baconized Turkey recipe (An old just no favorite)", "selftext": "I received a few messages a year on reddit about this recipe with people either asking questions, asking for the link, or just thanking me for posting it. I received one today thanking me for posting it and realized it's been a few years since I posted it and figured I should throw it out there again so more people have the chance of using it. I'm copying and pasting from my original post of this recipe which I'm thankful for whoever gave me gold for it because I never realized how active I was on reddit until I tried digging through my own hostory to find the damn thing. It is long and there was no way in hell I was typing all of that out again. The legacy sort by gilded feature is a godsend. If there's any questions please comment or just message me directly. Last year I literally talked two people through this recipe on thanksgiving day while I was prepping my own birds.\n\nFirst you need a bird. I buy 25 pounders because I can fit two of them in my oven at the same time. You buy whatever size is best for your family.\n\nSecond you need 2 pounds of bacon. I recommend Applewood smoked and also recommend avoiding maple bacon as I don't think it goes well with the turkey.\n\nThird, you need at least two boxes of stuffing. Yes I know some of you are going to say \"Don't stuff the bird it will dry it out\". Not if you use my method. My turkeys have always been moisturized to the point where the legs and wings literally fall off the bird while cooking.\n\nFourth you need butter.\n\nFifth you need herbs and spices. I use Parsley, Salt, Pepper, Cummin, Majoram, Red Pepper, Onion Powder, and Garlic powder.\n\nSixth, a box of aluminum foil.\n\nFirst, Thing I do (which is optional) is run my bacon through a meat grinder. You don't have to do it but I find it works better than using whole bacon strips in a couple of steps.\n\nSecond, I cook my stuffing mix. You can use a pot on the stove like the instructions on the stove top box says but I just dump the stale bread cubes into a bowl, slap in the butter and measure out the recommended amount of water from a boiling kettle and mix it up with a spoon. Does the same thing and you don't dirty a pot.\n\nThird, step take your thawed turkey out of the bag and put it into a clean sink. wash the bird with warm to hot water (no soap, My aunt used soap when I explained how I cook the bird and gave her family the shits) and that includes the cavity between the legs and at the neck hole. also remove those bags that have the heart, liver, and neck. Do what you want with those. I don't have a use for them. My grandmother used those to make gravy. I use the turkey and bacon drippings straight from the pan after the bird is done.\n\nFourth, put your bird in a deep roasting pan. Some these days come with a cooking rack. My birds are a lot juicier if I don't use the rack and if you have a narrow over like I do you may not be able to fit the bird in the oven if you use it.\n\nFifth now this is going to get a little weird for some of you but this next step if crucial for a self basting bird. Now as you can see from this picture( [http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20111102-stuffed-turkey-01.jpg](http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20111102-stuffed-turkey-01.jpg) )There is the skin and the meat of the bird right above the cavity. Connecting the skin to the meat is a membrane. You have to very carefully split that all the way up the breast meat. Pull up on the skin and make a small hole in the membrane with your finger or start it with a knife. Then stick a finger in there and gently work the hole until it gets wide enough to stick your whole hand in there (stop laughing) And you gently work the skin away from the breast meat but don't separate it all the way up at the other cavity at the neck. You are making a bacon pocket.\n\nSixth, Now take you bacon be it ground up or in strips and start putting it in that bacon pocket. If it's in strips lay it in going across the breasts and have it slightly overlap and keep going until you get all the way to the tip of the meat sticking out of the skin. Ground bacon basically form little patty's with it and put a nice healthy layer in there covering the breasts all the way down to the bottom of the pocket. You will not use all the bacon in that pocket. This will guarantee that your breasts stay moist and the bacon fat keeps the bird well lubricated so you don't have to baste it at all.\n\nSixth, Time to turn on that oven and finish making the stuffing. I cook my birds at 300F You can follow standard cooking instructions for a stuffed bird the size you bought. I go low and slow with mine for 5-7 hours or until it reaches safe poultry temps in the middle of the stuffing. Do not poke the meat on the bird. The stuffing will be at a cooler temp than the meat. No reason to poke  the meat and letting the juices escape. That's how you get a dry bird. You see that extra bacon? Yeah that still gets used. If you are working with strips then cut it up into small pieces. Ground bacon users no worries, You don't have to do that. Take your bacon and cook it up in a pan. When it's cooked enough not to be a health hazard mix it in with your stuffing. Now stuff that bird with as much of that bacon laced stuffing you can fit in there without breaking it's ribs. When the bird cooks the hot grease from the bacon in that stuffing will get up into the breast meat and the fat from the bacon under the skin will cook down into it. The breast meat will be so moist it will literally fall off the bone when you go to cut it off the bird.\n\nSeventh lightly rub down the bird with a little bit of butter. It will help with the seasoning.\n\nEighth Sprinkle on your seasoning.\n\nNinth, Grab your roll of aluminum foil. We are about to make a tent. I use three to four sheets of foil for this step because I don't want the foil to touch the bird. If it does then oh well but less contact the better. Pull off a sheet longer than your roasting pan. Hopefully yours has a lip around the edge like mine. Put the edge of the foil under the lip of the pan and work it around that edge and fold it over the top of the bird. Continue to do so with each sheet until you have your bird completely covered and sealed in foil. That tent will keep the moisture in the pan which will make for a very juicy bird. We are not roasting a turkey we are steaming it in it's own and bacon juices.\n\nTenth, Put that sucker in the oven and leave it alone. Look up the recommended cook times for the size bird you have stuffed and half an hour before that time is up pull out your bird, remove the foil, and stick it back in for the rest of the time. The skin will brown up and get crispy. If you're going low and slow I check my bird after 5 hours. Usually it's done by then but I still take off the foil and put it back in for half an hour. Still juicy as hell but the skin looks a lot better.\n\nEleventh. After you take the bird out of the oven DO NOT CUT IT! Let that bastard rest. The key to having any kind of juicy meat is letting the meat rest before you slice it. Those juices are still boiling in there and they need to settle down. While you are waiting you can scoop out the stuffing and mix it in with what didn't fit in the bird. That is super stuffing because all of those turkey juices are in that bread. I also drain off the fat in the bottom of the pan and use it for a gravy. After half an hour of resting (or however long you were able to wait) feel free to dig in.\n\nEasy gravy recipe. Drain off the drippings from the pan into a pot. in a separate skillet melt some butter and throw some flour in it and mix it up. Usually it's equal part flour and butter but I just eyeball it so I can't give proper measurements. Anyway that is called a roux. you can either use it immediately or let it darken in the pan. Be careful not to burn it. if you burn it it will make your gravy taste awful. The darker it is the more flavor it has. Black is burnt. next bring your bird juice to a light boil and whisk in the roux. add salt a little at a time until it's perfect. The gravy from this bird will taste amazing because of the bacon and you might have to whack people with a wooden spoon to keep them from just drinking it.\n\nI hope everybody has a peaceful and happy thanksgiving. Either with just your small household or my personal favorite if you are using this recipe and it causes the just no's in your life to have an internal meltdown with how much you nailed that fucking turkey.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/dz9zzj/my_baconized_turkey_recipe_an_old_just_no_favorite/", "created_utc": 1574291537.0, "score": 125, "author": "SilentJoe1986", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/dz9zzj/my_baconized_turkey_recipe_an_old_just_no_favorite/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thanks for the recipe!

{"title": "Fried Chicken", "selftext": "I had a request for my fried chicken. This is massively influenced by Martha Stewart and by my 3 sons' tastes. :-)\n\nThe night before I want to serve it, I put the chicken in the fridge to defrost overnight if it's frozen. First thing in the morning (well, after I've had my coffee, let's be real here) I put it in a baggie and pour in a marinade of buttermilk and Frank's Red Hot. (I used to use Tabasco, but I find that to be very one-note: it's hot and nothing more. Frank's has some complexity.) The chicken baggie goes back in the fridge, and if I think about it, I turn and massage it every once in a while. About 45 minutes before dinner, I dump the chicken pieces into a colander to drain, but I do not rinse them. Meanwhile I stir together some AP flour, maybe a bit of cornmeal or semolina, seasoned salt, cayenne, and fresh-ground black pepper. I dredge the chicken pieces in that and put on a wire-grid to rest for about 30 minutes. I heat up some peanut oil in a cast iron skillet and pre-heat the oven to 225 (convection if you've got it) or so. Once the oil is up to 375 or so, the chicken pieces get dredged a second time in the seasoned flour and then fried. Don't crowd the pan or do too many at once or the oil temp will reduce too much. As the chicken is finished, it goes onto another grid and into the oven to keep warm. I don't use paper towels because I find that chicken sitting on greasy paper towels just gets soggy. (And, well, I don't use paper towels at all anymore, I use single-ply cheap-cheap-cheap gauze diapers, lol, which I can launder and re-use.) I think the resting-and-redredging is the key; the chicken looks very dry after the 1st dredging, but after resting, the initial flour coating has absorbed the buttermilk-marinade and it looks very wet. It looks very dry again after the second dredging.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/hmn6pz/fried_chicken/", "created_utc": 1594093829.0, "score": 119, "author": "HettyBates", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/hmn6pz/fried_chicken/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thanks for sharing! \nHow much franks hot sauce do you use?", "For us in the UK, anyone know what we can use as a substitute for Franks?

They hated it - but after one cookie I decided it was amazing.\n\nSo, my (wonderful!) holiday job was to eat as much lebkuchen as possible so she could use the tin to hold her craft supplies. I was very dedicated! ;) Now, I have a taste for lebkuchen that I rarely get to sate. . .until NOW :D", "Currently living in Germany and I love seeing German recipes on here.

{"title": "Pumpkin cheesecake for showing off this thanksgiving", "selftext": "Here is my general recipe that has been a hit at my family and my in laws for years. It\u2019s always the first and only dessert to be annihilated and I\u2019m 80% sure my husband\u2019s aunts planned their whole dessert menu around it last year (they\u2019re lovely and hilarious)\n\n\nI will warn you I\u2019m more of an intuitive cook so there is some wiggle room with the spices and such. Happy baking!\nAlton Browns cheesecake episode of good eats was the reason I first made cheesecake over 10 years ago. The little bits effort and care really make a difference in the final product \n\n\n\nCrust \n9 oz gingersnaps\n6 tb melted butter\n\n\nCheesecake\n4 eggs at room temp\n4 packs / 2 lbs cream cheese room temp\n1.25 cups sugar\n2 tb heavy cream\n2 tb flour plus 1 Tb flour \n1 can pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)\nVanilla extract  2 ts \nPumpkin pie spice ~1 Tb? Start a teaspoon at a time \n\n\n1. preheat oven to 325 f. \n\n2. Line a springform pan with parchment paper and brush with  melted butter. Make sure you get the sides buttered\n\n3. Prep the crust: crush up the cookies (food processor or bag and rolling pin). Melt butter and add to the cookie crumbs. Press the mix into the bottom of the pan. \n\n4. Bake crust for 8-10 minutes\n\n5. Up oven temp to 350 f\n\n6. In a mixer with a paddle attachment, start mixing the cream cheese and sugar. Keep cleaning the sides down with a rubber spatula. \n\n7. When that is smooth, add the eggs one a time. Wait until the egg is incorporated before adding another. \n\n8. Add the 2 Tb flour and heavy cream and vanilla and continue to mix \n\n9. Ok here\u2019s where it gets fuzzy-I usually  separate the plain and the pumpkin. So take about a fourth to a third of your  plain mix and put it in another bowl. Add to this smaller amount the pumpkin (start with half a can) and the pumpkin spice and a touch of vanilla and the Tb of flour and mix. I kind of feel it out here. You want it to taste good on it\u2019s own but it\u2019s going to get swirled into the rest. If it\u2019s too watery you can add a little more flour. \n\n\n10. Add a layer of the white mix to the pan and flatten it out with a spoon. The pour a bit of the pumpkin mix. Alternate the mix until the pan is full. You can do some swirls with a knife or just layer. (YouTube is your friend here). \n\n\n11. Bake at 350 for 50-60 minutes* until it only just jiggles in the center. \nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND a water bath. I cover the outside of the pan in foil and the put the pan into a roasting pan with water. This let\u2019s it cook more gently and helps prevent cracking. \n\n\n12. Cool SLLOOOWWWLY.

{"title": "Strawberry Lemonade No-Bake Cheesecake", "selftext": "Hi, all! I got into a [little rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/d8p2io/indefinitely_banned_from_ils_house_because_i/) about being made to sit outside my ILs' house because I offended some fee-fees, and mentioned this dessert that I'm making for Thanksgiving (that MIL and SFIL will likely be missing out on now). I'll be honest, I made it up on the fly when trying to think of a \"lemon cake\" recipe I could make for my new boss to welcome him to the team. It's a really loose recipe, one of those \"a little of this and that\" (which may or may not have been an excuse to \"taste test\" often) but if you're more of a structured individual, it's totally fine to use any no-bake cheesecake recipe and just modify it! Here's how I did it:\n\n**2 eight-ounce packages of cream cheese** (I use Philadelphia because I do *not* skimp on name-brand cream cheese in recipes)\n\n**1/4 cup lemon juice**\n\n**About 1/2 cup granulated sugar**\n\n**About 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar**\n\n**Strawberry extract to taste** (I think I used roughly a tablespoon)\n\n**1 can lemon creme** (you will not use the whole can and that's fine; if you want to make it fresh, that's fine too!) \n\n**1 can strawberry pie filling** (you could probably also use sundae topping, just anything with that slightly jelly, syrup-y consistency; again, you won't use the whole can)\n\n***Optional:*** **1/2 tsp vanilla extract** (I honestly couldn't find any when I made this. Whoops! It'll turn out fine without it, but you might not like your cake so tart you're threatened with indigestion.)\n\nYou can make your crust from scratch; if you do, I'd recommend a plain graham cracker crust. I used a pre-made Keebler, but that's no reason you shouldn't go wild!\n\nLet the cream cheese soften before you combine your ingredients. It helps with the consistency and you won't break your arm trying to blend it. You can mix by hand or use an electric mixer on a medium setting. Add the granulated sugar first, as it'll cut the cream cheese and make your blending loads easier. Then add the confectioner's sugar, slowly so it doesn't look like you murdered a powder puff on the counter, and blend until smooth. Add your strawberry extract and stir until combined. \n\nPour your mixture into the crust, then smooth it out (I use an icing smoother I got for maybe 8 bucks at walmart, but anything flat and thin would more than likely work--even a butterknife). Once smoothed, pour lemon creme over it and smooth; use just enough to make a layer so thick you cannot see the cheesecake mixture. Drop a few dollops of the strawberry filling onto the creme, making sure not to add too many big chunks of fruit, and swirl into the creme with the knife--channel your inner Bob Ross here. Let it chill for roughly an hour before serving, depending on how long you let the cream cheese soften. mine was firm in about a half-hour, but freezers vary. \n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/d8wvpt/strawberry_lemonade_nobake_cheesecake/", "created_utc": 1569377117.0, "score": 119, "author": "PowderKegSuga", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/d8wvpt/strawberry_lemonade_nobake_cheesecake/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Sounds yummy!

I like the fairly bitter kind)\n300g heavy cream\n4tbsp or so brown sugar\n1-3 punnets strawberries\n1/2 lemon\n\nThere's ways for making ganache in the microwave that work. If you want to use those, go away with the chocolate, brown sugar, and cream, and come back for step 2.\n\n1. Break the chocolate into pieces if it isn't.

Add it to the ganache, and stir until it's mixed in fully. Remove from heat.\n\n3. If the strawberry stems don't come off very easily, my fianc\u00e9 would strongly suggest cutting them off. You could use toothpicks to dip them, if so. Anyway, dip strawberries in chocolate ganache, and set on waxed paper. Put in refrigerator.\n\n4. Do you like fudge? That's basically set ganache. Put it in a casserole dish and shove it in the fridge. Do you like mousse? Did you know one way to make mousse is just chill ganache for a bit, whip it up, then chill it fully? Alternatively, if you just put in in small cups, it's the most indulgent pudding you've ever had (small, because it's VERY rich).  ...You can come up with many, many good uses for the remaining ganache, trust me.

I'm making this in Britain, so forgive some slightly weird items. Spice amounts are approximate. Just taste the things and adjust until it tastes right to you. I'd taste the cream before whipping, but remember that it fluffs up, so it'll be less sweet and less strongly flavoured when you're done - though note you want the whipped cream to still be pretty delicate. \n\nMixed spice is a British thing. You could probably substitute an American pumpkin pie spice, but you DEFINITELY want the mace and cinnamon flavours.\n\nI've based this loosely off of https://hymnsandverses.com/easy-apple-dumplings/ \n\n4 apples.

Taste, remembering that it's not whipped yet, so it'll all taste stronger, and adjust spice mix to taste, but remember it's meant to be spicy, but relatively delicate.  Put in the freezer for 10 minutes or so - this makes it whip quicker - and whip to hard peaks. Put in refrigerator.

Medium sized to me is about 3 inches tall.*\n\n* 1 large hot house cucumber (a.k.a Persian cucumber: a.k.a. English cucumber) They are almost always wrapped in plastic at the store. *You can use regular cucumbers (peeled) but be warned they get soggy faster.*\n\n* 1 can (6 oz) of whole black olives (drained). *Don\u2019t use chopped canned olives; it doesn\u2019t stand well in the salad.*\n\n* 6 -8 mozzarella string cheese sticks (chopped crosswise-they\u2019ll look like little circles when you cut them). You can add more if you like.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. *Salt- Based on my hand/eyeball measurements that\u2019s probably around 1.5 tablespoons of salt.*\n\n\n2. Add pasta and stir so it doesn\u2019t clump together.\n\n\n3. Boil til al dente : 6-7 minutes.

Taste it again. Repeat every 30 seconds until you notice the change.       \n\n*Remember, pasta continues to cook after you strain it because of the retained heat so it\u2019s important that the noodles are not mushy.*\n\n\n4. Drain the pasta with a colander/strainer. \n*FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PEOPLE- DO NOT RINSE IT WITH WATER.*\n\n\n5. Add the drained pasta to a large mixing bowl. *I toss it every so often while chopping my stuff up so it doesn\u2019t stick together.*\n\n\n6. While letting the pasta cool I start chopping my veggies n stuff.\n\n\n7. Remove string cheese from packaging and cut crosswise (looks like little circles once you cut it up.)\n\n\n8. Dice the peppers.\n\n\n9. Cut the ends off the cucumber and discard (or repurpose elsewhere). Cut the cucumber length wise twice (should have four long pieces)and then cut those pieces cross wise (they\u2019ll look like pizza slices). *The thickness of the chop is up to you.*\n\n\n10. Finely chop/mince the red onion (optional).\n\n\n11. Open & drain your can of black olives.\n\n\n12. Mix your dressing and seasoning in a separate mixing bowl. *I like using a whisk for this.*\n\n\n13. Give the pasta a toss again and make sure nothing is sticking together.

{"title": "Mashed Potatoes, Candied Yams, & Garlic Bacon Green Beans", "selftext": "I'm sorry this may be sloppy and I am a very \"cook it til it's done\" kind of person. \n\n[Photo of all three dishes](https://imgur.com/a/Z8sO9h5)\n\nMASHED POTATOES \n\n*My dad likes to use two potatoes per guest. I like to use one potato per guest. I find that I still yield a veritable assload of potatoes and everyone still gets leftovers to bring home. The best potato advice he's given me is to alter your recipe slightly based on what kind of potatoes you've got. Yukon golds are slightly softer and require slightly less cook time and slightly less milk. Idaho potatoes are slightly harder and require more time and milk.*\n\nWash, peel, and quarter your potatoes. Put your chunks in a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water, salt the water, cover, and bring to a boil. Simmer until potatoes are fork tender but DO NOT wait until they are soft. Drain except for a little bit of potato water, mash by hand slightly with a wooden spoon or something to break up the chunks a bit, then add to stand mixer. Add whole milk, cream cheese, and butter until desired consistency. I'm sorry for no measurements but you measure this stuff by your guest count and butter is measured with your heart like Paula Deen tbh. Some people like their taters lumpy, some like whipped, and some like them in between. All potatoes are good potatoes. On the stove in a small pot, melt about 2 tbsp of butter and a ton of scored cloves of garlic on medium-low heat w the pot lid on. The scores release the juices. Carmelize the garlic just like you'd caramelize onions (thank you to a redditor who passed on this technique). When your garlic is soft and you can mash it apart with a fork, remove cover and turn up heat to medium-high for the remainder of your caramelizing. Then add a whole ass stick of butter to the finished product. The pot you are using should be hot enough still to just melt the whole stick even with the heat off. Add salt and black pepper to your garlic butter. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a small metal bowl. Then add to your potatoes and stir in. Done!\n\nCANDIED YAMS (sweet potatoes)\n\nWash and peel potatoes. Bake at 400 for an hour. Cool them down and then cut them into THICK slices. Often one potato is two to three slices for me. Cut the crusty skin off the potatoes. Place thick flat side down in a large glass dish. Make your sauce. Combine 1/2 stick butter, 1 cup tightly packed brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 cup water in a small pot and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Pour over the potatoes and pop the dish in the oven for an additional 45 minutes. \n\nGARLIC BACON GREEN BEANS\n\nWash and trim fresh green beans. I keep them long and trim carefully because my fiance is picky about his green beans-- his favorite. Bake bacon in the oven on a baking sheet (cover with 2 sheets tin foil) at 400 for 20 minutes. Flip after 10 minutes when halfway cooked. Remove bacon from the baking sheet and transfer to a plate with a paper towel on it. Layer paper towels and bacon to absorb grease off bacon. Spread your green beans onto the baking sheet that still has all that bacon grease on it. Add tons of minced garlic, a pinch of salt (do not over salt you're adding bacon) and white pepper, bake for 30 minutes. Toss them around the pan to make sure everything has been evenly coated. I then bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes because we like them a little roasted. Remove from baking sheet, I use tongs to make sure most of the grease stays on the pan. Add bacon to the finished green beans.

{"title": "My JustYes Maternal GMa's Awesome Cinnamon Buns plus BONUS Bun recipe", "selftext": "So as I mentioned my deceased maternal Grandma's awesome Cinamon buns of deliciousness in  passing in  this thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7qs4lk/comment/dssmlpl ) a year ago,  I figured it was well past  time  for me to share the recipe with you all.  It also comes with a recipe for regular dinner type buns (you know the type you butter at Thanksgiving/Christmas/Easter dinner and then make Turkey/duck/tofurkey buns with later once you've napped off/walked off the big dinner) so I'm sharing that one too. \n\nNote: you can substitute ingredients  as needed, for dietary reasons or personal preference.  Also this is transcribed from the recipe card (which is old and well loved) so I've broken up the ingredients list a little to keep things more organized \n\nBun/Cinnamon Bun recipe: \nIngredients: \n1) .\n12 cups white flour \n3/4 cups white sugar \n3 teaspoons salt \n1 1/2 cups rasins\n2 tablespoons fast rising dry yeast \n\n2) \n3 eggs\n3/8 cups margarine \n4 1/8 cups warm water \n\nProcedure:\n\nA) Preheat oven to 375 degrees for buns while your dough is doing it's first rise. Preheat oven to **350** degrees for Cinnamon Buns at this same point.\n\n1)mix first five ingredients in large bowl. \n\n2) Beat eggs in ***separate*** bowl. Melt margarine in microwave (30 seconds at a time, checking often). Mix. Add water gradually  to make sure water is warm before next step. \n\n3) Make a nest (hole) in flour mixture and gradually pour in and mix egg mixture. \n\n4) Mix dough first with a spoon then fold in with greased (\"greased\"=\"lightly coated with margarine\" here) hands.cover doughwith cloth and let rise until doubled in size (Approximately 1 to 1 &1/2 hours).\n \n5) Knead a little (knead just enough to take out just a tiny bit of your frustrations with your JustNos, folks) + form into 4 balls. Cover and let rise 15 mins.\n \nBuns: \n\n6) Take one ball at a time and form into long tube sausage formation. Cut into bun size pieces.\n\n7) Form into buns and place on greased (again \"greased\"= \"lightly coated/rubbed with margarine\" here) cookie sheet. Place 4 buns  across by 6 buns down. Cover and let rise 20-30 minutes (pro baking  tip: for this final rise, put cookie sheet on your stovetop as you'll have preheated your oven).  Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. \n\n\nCinnamon Buns: \n1) Roll out 1 or 2 of 4 balls into rectangle. Smear rectangle with margarine (just the inside portion of the rectangle, not the edges, folks). Cover with brown sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon (this is to taste, of course, but trust me, go a little wild with the brown sugar and put  just enough cinnamon on there to counteract the sweetness of the sugar a touch). You can also add raisins at this time if you wish (trust me, they make the cinnamon bun extra delicious). \n\n2) Roll rectangle up and put a little water along edge of \"sausage\" to keep it together (pro baking tip #2: also pinch the edges together a bit, as if you were pinching the back of your JustNo's hand to shut them up). \n\n3) Cut into buns. Cover and let rise in pans for 20 minutes (Go read a book or listen to a short podcast or play with your little ones/fur-babies or watch a short YouTube video while this is going on).\n\n4) bake in 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes. WATCH CAREFULLY (due to the sugar/margarine mixture they can burn easily). Flip out onto cooling rack (wire rack). (Pro baking tip #3 Line your cooling racks with wax paper so your baked goods don't get the impression of the rack on them or fall though the rack).\n\n5)Let cool slightly and enjoy a bun while still slightly warm. \n\nThere you have it.

{"title": "Steal This Apple Pie", "selftext": "Posting this for u/Cizzubelle and u/sethra007 and really anyone else whose MIL has stolen their apple pie and destroyed their dreams of cinnamon goodness.\n\nWhen I first made this pie I was browsing pinterest and found the cinnamon roll crust idea after hours of mindless browsing. This was years ago, but thanks to facebook algorithms and the illuminati, cinnamon roll crust is apparently so hot right now.\n\nDon't be scared, my friends, it's easy as heck to make. Here's one of the many, [super generic, super basic, pinterest mom recipes you can follow.](https://www.purewow.com/recipes/Cinnamon-Roll-Pie-Crust)\n\nSince I've just linked you a crusty step-by-step, I'll just share some notes from experience:\n\n* So, crusts, in my opinion, are easy to screw up. Luckily they are easy to fake thanks to Pilsbury. If you make a mean crust, use your badass crusting for this. With either route, I suggest having two crusts on hand.\n* This recipe calls for you to melt 4 tablespoons butter, mix with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. This, like most recipes you find, will call for vanilla extract. If that's your jam, go for it. I'm telling you right now it's unnecessary.\n\n^I ^ended ^up ^using ^5 ^tablespoons ^of ^salted ^Kerrygold ^butter, ^a ^heaping ^half ^cup ^of ^light ^brown ^sugar, ^and ^two ^tablespoons ^of ^cinnamon, ^plus ^a ^generous ^sprinkling ^of ^clove. ^Don't ^drink ^and ^bake ^if ^you're ^not ^experienced, ^kids. ^Or ^do, ^it's ^fine.\n\n* I don't have a rolling pin, apparently, so I just used the bottom of a pint glass, that I may or may not have used for wine, for the initial cinnamon roll flattening, and then used my hands to shape appropriately. It's fine if your pieces don't retain a perfectly circular shape, because not even your JustNoWhatever will taste the difference.\n* If you notice you may not have enough crust to perfectly build up the sides of the dish, that's where your handy second crust comes to play. You can either make another cinnamon roll with it, or you can be lazy like me and simply line the upper portions of the sides of your plate. No one ever complains about too much crust. If they do, they are not to be trusted and should be shown the door.\n\n#**AND NOW FOR THE FILLING.**\n\nMy secret is that I use apple AND pear for my apple pie filling. Personally, I like Jazz apples and Bosc pears for baking, but use whatever flavor profile you like. Apples and pears should be baked together because they are the most delicious of bed buddies and truly complimemt each other. I grew up in an orchard, I know these things.\n\nI typically use a 2:1 apple to pear ratio. This is apple pie, after all, with a pear surprise. Most people have never had pear in a baked product and it's fun to watch them try to figure out what that mysteriously tasty new flavor is next to the apple.\n  \n\n^Whatever ^you ^do, ^do ^not ^ever ^use ^Red ^Delicious ^for ^anything. ^It's ^not ^delicious. ^It's ^an ^agricultural ^abomination^.\n\n\nMoving on.\n\nI don't add flour to my filling. It's really just apples, pears, cinnamon and clove (to taste), and brown sugar (1 tablespoon). Throw it all into a big ziploc bag and mix around until your stress is nearly diminished. Then, let rest for at least an hour. You've just made a dessert orgy, let them mingle in their juices and have some foreplay before you turn up the heat to 375, okay?\n\nI drizzle in some lemon juice because that's always been a thing for baking apples in my family and I have no actual scientific reason for its use in recipes.\n\nWhen ready to bake, throw your filling into that amazing cinnamon roll crust and - BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE.\n\nYou like butter? I like butter. Apples like butter. Pears like butter. This pie likes butter.\n\nAdd pads of butter to the top of your filling. No particular shape, just evenly distributed. If you've added a latticework top crust, I suggest filling those holes with a bit of butter. This year, I think I used one tablespoon of butter for the filling. I also sprinkled brown sugar over the top prior to baking. If that sounds like a lot, I don't know what else to say other than I like pie and you should too.\n\nBake at 375. I think most apple pie recipes call for a 25 minute timer. I've got a temperamental oven, so I typically check the pie every 7 to 10 minutes or so. You'll be able to smell this bad boy cooking. He'll be a sexy golden Adonis when he's done. You'll hear the sizzle of the apples and pears mixing with the cinnamon roll filling and you'll just know they've had a good time together.\n\nAnd there you have it, friends.

I promise my crust is so easy to make (No rolling pin!  No food processor!)  and tastes a gazillion times better:\n\nTake a cup of all purpose flour (not self rising - use winter wheat like Lily White if your area carries it).  Add a tablespoon of sugar and a pinch of salt, and mix it around with your hand.  \n\nTake a half stick of cold butter (not margarine, NEVER margarine) and chop it into little squares over your flour mix.  Doesn't have to be perfect squares just hack with a knife.\n\nNow take a half cup of Crisco and plop it in the flour mix.  Get your hands in there and mush the butter squares and Crisco into little flour-coated not-sticky pebbles.  It should look like coarse sand when you're done.  Don't go to the next step til this part is done.\n\nNext add a half cup of sour cream, and mush into a dough.  Don't knead it! *The secret to awesome pastry is to touch it as little as possible*, just enough to get it into a ball-ish shape where its all the same color.  Wrap that sucker in plastic wrap and set it in the fridge for 20 minutes.\n\nNow unwrap and plop into the middle of a pie plate.  Use your fingers and palms to *press* the dough into the plate, working from the middle outwards (remember only touch as much as absolutely necessary).  When you get to the edges, you can either tuck them in neatly, or leave it alone because pie is for eating and nobody really cares whether your pie crust is fluted.\n\nBOOM!  Pie crust.  Flaky (thanks to Crisco) and golden (thanks to butter) and moist (thanks to sour cream) and delicious.  Takes a couple minutes' work, tops.  Try it and you will never use a Pillsbury crust again.", "For your viewing pleasure, u/TheeAdequateGatsby"]}

{"title": "Cesspool Kitchen Key Lime Pie", "selftext": "This is a crazy easy dessert that easily impresses people.  I will admit for some things, I just sort of do it to taste and dont use an exact measurement.  Unlike most things you bake, this is a pie that won't be ruined by a little deviation.  I believe this recipe makes enough filling for 2 8 inch pies.  For best flavor, be sure your kitchen is a cesspool of filth.  Gives an extra oomph to the pie.\n\nI am really adventurous with pie crusts in general.  You can literally make them out of any cookie or cracker product you like.  Besides traditional Graham, I have used sandies pecan shortbread cookies (awesome for lemon bars and this), ginger snaps (great for pumpkin pie or pumpkin cheesecake), pretzels, etc.  For this recipe, my fave is vanilla bean wafers from Trader Joe's which have real vanilla beans in them.\n\nCrust \n\n\u2022Not sure of an exact amount. I throw enough cookies in the food processor to make about a cup or so of crumbs.  \n\n\u2022Add approx 1/4 to1/3 cup butter\n\nYou can also add sugar, but I dont like things too sweet and don't add any.  You can if you like.\n\nBlend in food processor until butter is mixed in.\n\nSplit between pie tins and press into pie plate.  Don't worry about it being perfectly up the sides.  Bake at 350 for about 10 minutes until slightly browned.  Crust might be a little soft when you take it out, but will firm up as it cools.  Prepare filling while crust is baking.

Dont worry if there is lots of pulp in the juice.  It's even better.  Scrape some zest off a lime as well.  \n\nMix lime juice and milk first, taste as you add the juice, pulp, and zest to make sure it is limey enough.  Taste it and when you think it is perfect, add a bit more since baking it will mute the flavors.  \n\nAdd the egg yolks after you mix the juice and milk and stir.  Pour onto prepared crust.  Bake at 350 for about 25-30 minutes or until middle is firm.\n\nWhen done baking pull out and you can either chill and serve as is with whipped cream or go to next steps and make a meringue.  I use meringue since it is pretty.\n\nI use a super generic one like the recipe linked below except I also add a splash of pure alcohol free vanilla extract.

It's super easy and takes a total of 30-40 minutes to prepare/cook and everything is vegan. Probably the most \"vegan\" thing you'll need is nutritional yeast and vegan cheese shreds, which are easy to find at most stores nowadays.\n\nYou will need an Instant Pot or similar pressure cooker; ~~I personally recommend the Instant Pot brand because it comes in a variety of sizes, it's electric and very easy to use, and I've never had a bad outcome that was not due to user error. You can almost always find the Instant Pot on sale if you shop around or set up some sort of alert for it as well.~~\n\n*I just bought a new Instant Pot 6-qt model and I am getting consistent errors based on recipes I've used for years in my older model, so I'm no longer recommending this brand.

Put the lid on and use the Manual mode to cook on High for 4 minutes.

{"title": "Poison your MIL with Mushroom Soup (not really, it's really very nice)", "selftext": "Another weird food belief from some people is that all mushrooms are poisonous. So if you have one of those MILs who refuse to eat mushrooms because they will diiiiieeeee, and you feel like some food trolling, this could be the recipe for you. Plus it's very nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients: \n\n500g of mushrooms, sliced (I cheat and used pre-sliced white mushrooms from the supermarket)\n\n4 rashers of chopped bacon\n\n1 chopped onion\n\n1 tsp garlic (from a jar again)\n\n60g butter\n\n1/4 cup gluten free plain flour\n\n4 cups chicken stock \n\n250 ml cream\n\nchopped fresh tarragon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow to make your soup:\n\nSaute the bacon and onions in the butter, then add the garlic. Once the onion is transparent, add the flour and cook further, making a roux. Add the stock, stirring so that any flour comes off the bottom of the saucepan. Add the mushrooms and bring to the boil. Then turn down and simmer for 30 minutes, until the mushrooms are cooked through and the soup has thickened. Add the cream and chopped tarragon, and stir through before serving. \n\nOK, I'll let you in on a secret. I use 300 ml of cream. In Australia, cream comes in 300ml containers, and who needs 50 ml of spare cream floating around the fridge? I chuck it all in. \n\nAlso, the soup can absolutely be made without the fresh tarragon, if there is none available. It's still delicious, but in a slightly different way. \n\nThe main debate in my household is whether to blend, or not to blend. The original recipe, which I got from a now-vanished internet source, said the soup was based off a mushroom pasta sauce, so I say don't blend. My Dad, however (he who flings clean PJ's at Narcissists) is very much in the blend it camp. Ultimately, it's your soup, it's up to you.

{"title": "MIL's Ruin Gin and Tonic Cupcakes (the gluten free version)", "selftext": "It's amazing how many MILs are anti-alcohol. This recipe combination would have them shrieking that you're going to hell. Ruining nice, wholesome cupcakes with alcohol. Won't somebody please think of the children? (I did, there's a kid friendly suggestion at the end). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make the cupcakes you need:\n\n175 g of softened butter\n\n175 g caster sugar\n\n175 g gluten free self raising flour (White Wings gives consistently good results)\n\n3 medium eggs at room temperature\n\n4 tablespoons tonic water\n\n1 teaspoon of gin per cupcake - added after the cupcakes are baked (this recipe makes 12)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius, and line a cupcake or muffin tin with 12 cupcake cases. \n\nCream the butter and sugar together in a bowl (don't be a masochist, use an electric hand beater for this). Then add the eggs one at a time, making sure the first is completely incorporated into the mixture before adding the second, and so on. Add the flour, and make sure it is completely mixed in. Don't over stir the mix. Then add the tonic water and mix that in. \n\nAt this stage, look at your mix. If it's \"split\", add a little more flour and mix it in. GF flours can be temperamental beasties, much like drama llamas. I will say that when I started using White Wings GF self raising flour, my batter turned out perfectly each time. \n\nDivide the mix evenly between each of the cupcake case, being careful not fill any 2/3 of the way.\n\nPut them in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes, until they are done. If you stab them with a skewer, the skewer should come out clean. \n\nOnce they are done, put the whole tray on a cooling rack, stab each one with a skewer about a dozen times, and pour a teaspoon of gin over each cupcake, while they are still warm. (How I do this is pour some gin in a small bowl, take a teaspoon and pour the gin over each cupcake. I may need to refill the bowl halfway. Any gin left in the bowl at the end is chef's perks.)\n\nNow, while your cupcakes cool, there is the small matter of the icing. \n\nFor this you need:\n\n250g softened butter\n\n500g pure icing sugar (icing mix may not be GF)\n\nJuice and grated zest of one lime\n\n4 tablespoons of gin\n\nMix the butter and icing sugar together (again, don't be a masochist, use a hand beater). I find it best to start with the butter and about a quarter of the icing sugar, mixing them together, adding the next quarter, mixing ... and so on. Add the lime juice, and the gin, and mix them all together until the icing is soft, white and fluffy. Right at the end, I mix finely grated zest through the mix by hand (it tends to clump on the beaters). \n\nThen I pipe the mix onto the cooled cupcakes, in a great big heaped swirl. More icing=more gin. But if you want less icing, you can use half the batch, and freeze the rest of the icing for your next batch of cupcakes. \n\nHere is the original recipe, for reference: [https://bakeitinstinct.com/2013/08/21/gin-and-tonic-cupcakes/](https://bakeitinstinct.com/2013/08/21/gin-and-tonic-cupcakes/)\n\nAs promised, here is my kid-friendly suggestion, for when you are serving these in mixed company. \n\nBake the cupcakes as normal. I use different coloured cupcake cases for the ones that need to be alcohol-free. Only do the stab and pour thing for the cupcakes going to the adults. Then I make a batch of icing, but leave out the gin. Ice the kids' cupcakes, and add a funky icing sugar decoration to the kids' cupcakes to make them obvious. \n\nThen I add the proportional amount of gin to the remaining icing, and mix it in. For example, if only 6 of the cupcakes are going to adults, I add 2 tablespoons of gin. Then ice the adults' cupcakes. \n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/9a268g/mils_ruin_gin_and_tonic_cupcakes_the_gluten_free/", "created_utc": 1535152429.0, "score": 73, "author": "purpleprot", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/9a268g/mils_ruin_gin_and_tonic_cupcakes_the_gluten_free/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["> freeze the rest of the icing for your next batch of cupcakes. \n\nOR... make swirled \"Kisses\" on parchment paper, freeze them, and then store the Gin Kisses in a tin in the freezer for when you need an emergency bit of love & \"kisses.\"\n\nI'm gonna lick the beaters, and the bowl, and the spoon...\n\nThanks for posting this and the recipe source!", "I\u2019m not keen on G+T, but big upvote for GF!", "In Italy they use rum.

I\u2019ve experimented with different kinds, and will only use fresh grated Grana Padano Parmesan. It has a strong Parmesan fragrance and taste, but can be pricey. I buy the store brand (Publix) to try and save a few pennies. You can use Kraft powdered Parmesan from the jar or the preshredded/flaked Parmesan in the tub from the dairy section, it just won\u2019t be as creamy or flavorful.  For a special occasion, splurge for the good stuff. Don\u2019t use something flavored like an Asiago, it just doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know the science; it just doesn\u2019t work and I loooooooove Asiago. \n\nThe other key is the white pepper. If you don\u2019t use white pepper- go buy some today!! It gives dishes a depth of flavor you don\u2019t get from black pepper. You only need a small bit for the oomph, so a bottle should last you a while...unless you are like me and fall in love and put it on everything. Seriously, it changes a dish in ways you never imagined! \n\nThe exact measurements don\u2019t really matter, so if your spinach is larger or smaller, it\u2019s okay. I usually use the plain store brand unless the brand name stuff is on sale. If you use fresh, you will use an entire garden\u2019s worth, since it shrinks down so much as it cooks!! I can\u2019t even begin to estimate how much you would need, so just use the frozen stuff. \n\nThe size of the onion depends on how much you like onions. The key is they must be sweet and not harsh; using a high quality sweet butter helps too.  Margarine won\u2019t give you the same sweetness if you try to substitute it. If your onion has started to go bitter, decrease the amount of onion used and add a touch of sugar; You can cook the onions through to the caramelized stage if you have the patience. It will be worth it. Otherwise, they should at least be completely softened. This is a creamy dish that would be ruined by biting into a still crunchy piece of onion. You can use more butter if you don\u2019t think 1/2 a stick is enough for your onions; I wouldn\u2019t use more than a stick though. \n\nDon\u2019t substitute anything for the block of cream cheese. You need the thick creaminess it gives the dish. \n\nIf you prefer to chop your own garlic, go for it. You can toss it in with the onions for the last few minutes to soften it up. I use the minced or chopped garlic in olive oil because I\u2019m a pretty lazy cook (I know - that doesn\u2019t make any sense since I grate my own Parmesan. I save my energy for the things that matter. In this dish it\u2019s the Parmesan, not the garlic.)\n\nIf you REALLY want to show it off for company, put it in a small casserole dish and top with a mixture of more Parmesan and a bit of grated cheddar. Put it under the broiler for the cheese topping to melt and brown a bit and call it Spinach avec du fromage.

{"title": "Corned Beef Brisket (w/ 10 day brine)", "selftext": "Requested on a JustNoMIL thread. This recipe is a modified version of Alton Brown's corned beef brine. My wife has a very sensitive digestive system and before this recipe, never liked corned beef. I've received a lot of compliments over the years for this recipe and I hope you enjoy. It is a bit of a labor of love, but in my family's opinion, completely worth it. The hardest part for most people is finding room in the refrigerator for the meat to sit for 10 days. The second hardest part is not eating all of it the first night because the leftovers make for fantastic Reuben sandwiches and wraps... :-)\n\nEdit: An award? Why thank you!! Also forgot to add... the juniper berries ended up being an item I found at Whole Foods. My regular grocery store did not carry them. Also, the last time I bought pink curing salt, I ordered it from the online smile store named after a river in South America. Everything else was regular grocery items.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 quarts water\n* 1 cup kosher salt\n* 1/2 cup brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons saltpeter or pink curing salt\n* 2 cinnamon sticks, broken into several pieces\n* 1 teaspoon mustard seeds\n* 1 teaspoon black peppercorns\n* 8 whole cloves\n* 8 whole allspice berries\n* 12 whole juniper berries\n* 2 bay leaves, crumbled\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n* ice, 2 x 4-cup glass measuring cup filled\n* 1 (6 to 8 pound) beef brisket, trimmed\n* 2 gallon plastic bag or large airtight container\n* 3-4 potatoes, any quality as they will be discarded after cooking\n* 1-2 bottles Guinness Extra Stout beer\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Place the water into a large 6 to 8 quart stockpot along with salt, sugar, saltpeter, cinnamon stick, mustard seeds, peppercorns, cloves, allspice, juniper berries, bay leaves and ginger. Cook over high heat until the salt and sugar have dissolved. You do not have to bring it to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the first 4 cups of ice. Stir until the ice has melted. Add the second batch of ice and stir until dissolved. If necessary, place the brine into the refrigerator until it reaches a temperature of 45 degrees F.\n2. Once it has cooled, place the brisket in a 2-gallon zip top bag or large plastic container that has a lid which makes an airtight seal. Add enough brine to make sure the meat is fully covered. If using a plastic container, fill to the brim so that once you add the lid, there is little to no air inside. If you have extra brine, strain out the spices and add them to the bag or container. Seal bag or container and place in the refrigerator for 10 days. Gently shake daily to make sure the beef is completely submerged and stir the brine. After 10 days, remove container from the refrigerator. It's time to cook.\n3. Preheat oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Cut potatoes in half to create a layer in the bottom of your cooking pot.They are only needed to keep the meat from sitting in the beer while cooking so you want the chunks big. If using a roasting pan and you have a rack that can keep the meat up out of the beer, the potatoes are not needed.\n4. Remove beef from brine and rinse thoroughly making sure to wash off all spices. Place beef flat in pot on top of the potatoes (or on rack in roasting pan), fat side up and pour the entire bottle of beer over the top. For larger pans, if 1 beer does not cover the bottom of the pan, add more beer until it does as long as it's not touching the meat. Add lid (or cover tightly with foil) and place in the oven. Set timer for 6 hours. When the timer goes off, take the meat out of the oven. Let sit for 15 minutes before carving although you can use that time to trim fat if desired. Discard cooked potatoes and beer.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Chill leftovers before slicing. Low and slow cooking makes the meat fall apart tender which can make slicing thin quite difficult.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/k0jtsb/corned_beef_brisket_w_10_day_brine/", "created_utc": 1606273321.0, "score": 70, "author": "virtualchoirboy", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/k0jtsb/corned_beef_brisket_w_10_day_brine/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This sounds amazing, I love corned beef!

{"title": "Pyes of Atlantia", "selftext": "I belong to the SCA, (www.sca.org) an International nonprofit organization that researches and recreates the Middle Ages and Renaissance. It's not just guys with swords bashing at each other. We research and recreate many other facets of medieval life. Among those is cooking.\n\nI would like to present to you, in honor of Pi Day, a medieval style meat pie. The inspiration for this was called Pyes of Paris. Since this is a modern redaction, I am going to reference my kingdom and call it Pyes of Atlantia.\n\nFirst make a coffin for thine pie, of fresh butter and flower. Take Fayr fresh pork, and smite it into gobbets, and do there-to Synnamon and Ginger and Nutmeg. And take apples and pare them and cutte them small and do onion likewise. Melt some butter in a pan and put there-to thine pork and apple and onion and spices. Cook it until it is enough and add there-to some wine and cook until the wine is gone. Then put it in thine coffin and bake it in a hot oven. And when it is done serve it forth.\n\nWhat? You want like *measurements* and stuff? Okay.\n\n**Crust** (called a coffin in medieval times.) Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0 F.\n\n1 cup all purpose flour.\n\n1/2 cup butter, softened. (1 stick.)\n\n1/4 cup water.\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt.. \n\nStir salt into flour. Cut butter into flour with a pastry cutter or knife until it resembles small crumbs. Add Water. Put a plastic bag over your hand and smush it around until you get a soft dough. You may need a tablespoon or two more flour to make it workable. Now if you want to be fancy and you have a rolling pin and some sort of a rolling cloth and you feel that you can get pie crust into a pan without breaking it, have at thee. I can't. I just plop the whole assembly into a small casserole dish and press it out until I get more or less even coverage inside the casserole dish. Bake for 10 minutes and remove from oven.\n\n**Filling**\n\n2 cups finely chopped Apple. I like Granny Smith and or Pink Ladies.\n\n1 cup finely chopped Vidalia or other sweet onion.\n\n1 to 2 cups finely chopped pork.\n\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour.\n\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.\n\n1/4 teaspoon ginger.\n\n1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.\n\nRos\u00e9 or white wine. (*Not* cooking wine! Something that you would enjoy drinking.)\n\n3 tablespoons butter.\n\nPlace flour and spices in large plastic bag and shake to combine. Add the pork and shake well to coat the pork pieces.\n\nMelt the butter in a fry pan and sautee the pork about 5 minutes. Add the apple and onion and sautee for another 5 to 10 minutes until the onion has turned translucent and the apple is starting to soften. Add a splash of wine and stir until the wine has mostly evaporated away.\n\nPut filling into prepared crust and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. And serve it forth. \n\nThis is good either hot or cold. Mine is currently in the oven and we'll be eating it cold after it gets dark, because right now DH is outside with a whole bunch of other SCA archers and they're attempting to poke holes in targets with various pointy objects.

{"title": "Gluten Free French Bread & G-Free Flour Mix", "selftext": "As promised, the recipe for gluten-free French bread.\nHere is the *original* [recipe from Carol Kicinski,](https://simplygluten-free.com/blog/2011/11/gluten-free-french-bread-recipe-easy-easy-easy.html).  Please note, I have not made her exact recipe as I try to stay away from xanthan gum and processed sugar.  I will dispute her insistance on NOT using parchment paper to line the French loaf pan\u2014did that once, *never* again!  USE fucking parchment paper to line the loaf pan, otherwise you WILL have little pinheads of bread ALL over the kitchen as you scrape the hell out of your new pan trying to get the loaves to release from the perfs.  Or don't, but I will roll my eyes and laugh at you.\n\nFor my take on the original recipe, I mix my own flour blend and am currently liking this 'whole grain' mix.  For more info on flour blends and what you can mix and match, check out [Gluten-free Girl](https://glutenfreegirl.com/2013/02/how-to-make-a-gluten-free-whole-grain-flour-blend/).  Poke around her site, she also has a formula for 'all purpose' flour.\n\nFor a double batch to keep ready:\n\n* 400 grams Millet Flour\n\n* 500 g Buckwheat Flour (this is a seed related to rutabaga, it's NOT wheat!)\n\n* 500 g Oat Flour\n\n* 150 g Sweet Rice Flour\n\n* 150 g Tapioca Flour\n\n***Ingredients***\n\n* 2 tablespoons Dry Active Yeast\n\n* 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup or honey\n\n* 1\u00bd cups warm water, *minus 2 tablespoons* 115\u00b0 to 120\u00b0F (I use Seltzer Water, the carbonation adds body. Also, an instant read thermometer really helps!)\n\n* 2 tablespoons psyllium husk powder\n\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n* 3 Cups of above flour blend, or blend of your choice\n\n* 1\u00bd teaspoons kosher or fine sea salt\n\n* 2 large eggs (room temp) lightly beaten\n\n* 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n\n***Instructions***\n\n1. Combine syrup and warm water in a bowl, stir in the yeast.  Let sit for 5-6 minutes (10 if the yeast has been in the fridge) or until it is foamy and *doubled in size.*  \n\n2. In a small bowl stir the psyllium husk powder the olive oil until dissolved.\n\n3. Sift the flour and salt in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or just the regular beaters \u2013 don\u2019t use a dough hook) and mix to combine. Add the yeast mixture, psyllium mixture, eggs and vinegar and mix on low to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once. Turn the mixer to high and mix for 3 minutes.\n\n4. Line French bread pan (with 2 forms) with parchment paper.\n\n5. Spoon the batter into the forms and shape into an oval with a spatula. Lightly smooth top with oiled spatula.  Spray a light coat of olive oil or brush with butter.  \n\n6. Cover the loaves with a clean kitchen towel and set in a warm, draft-free place to rise. Let rise for 30 minutes or until the loaves have doubled in size.  OR spoon into a *large,* non-stick, **heavy, dark colored** loaf pan (9.25\u201d x 5.25\u201d x 2.75\u201d).  Do NOT try to use a smaller loaf pan.  It **WILL** rise and overflow!  Ask me how I know.  *sigh*  (If using loaf pan, don't expect a round, domed top.  It ain't gonna happen, but you'll have a loaf big enough to make BLTs.  So, YAY!)\n\n7. Place a baking pan on the bottom rack, in the lowest position, and fill it with about an inch of water\u2014the bottom of a broiler pan is perfect for this. Position the rack you are baking the bread on in the middle of the oven. Turn the oven on and **preheat to 500\u00b0 F.**\n\n8. Once the loaves have risen, **reduce the oven temp to 400\u00b0F** and bake for 40-45 minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes then remove to a wire rack to finish cooling.  If you have an instant read thermometer, you want the center of the bread to be about 210\u00b0F.\n\n\n**Recipe Notes:**\n\nBEWARE:  The pan of water generates a LOT OF **HOT** F\u2019en STEAM!  When opening the oven to load or unload the bread, open the oven door *and stand back for a second.*  **IF** you wear glasses, like I do, push those puppies to the top of your head!  Otherwise, you\u2019ll be steam-blind until your lenses clear.\n\nStore bread *fully cooled* bread in a perforated bread bag, or wrap in a cotton kitchen towel or muslin bread bag.  Once sliced, cover *sliced end only* with plastic wrap, then wrap in towel.  If you *bag* the bread in plastic, it will lose it\u2019s crusty crust.  Depending on your home\u2019s humidity, this will last @ 4 days before it starts to mold!  Wrap in plastic amd freeze so you can use it for other recipes.\n\nWhen measuring gluten free flours with CUP measurements, as opposed to using a scale, [follow these instructions!](https://www.thespruceeats.com/measure-gluten-free-flours-and-starches-1451170) I think for Americans, this will make a huge difference in your gluten-free recipe attempts.\n\nIf you want to make a roasted garlic version, peel and slice 6-8* or so cloves of fresh garlic into several pieces.  Stir into dough before spooning into your loaf pan(s).  I often will spoon out one loaf, then mix garlic into the rest for the second loaf and mark the top with a piece of garlic.  *The 6-8 cloves is for a *single* French loaf.\n\nIf the bread does not come out to your liking, do NOT throw it out.  You can turn it into tasty croutons or bread crumbs for other recipes!\n\nYou can use 2 Teaspoons of sugar instead of maple syrup or honey for proofing the yeast.  If you do, don't subtract anything from the water.\n\nLastly, I know that this sounds really involved.  But once you settle on your flour, and make it two or three times, it goes so much quicker.  Play with it and please enjoy!\n\nEdit(s): freaking formatting.

{"title": "Vegan marbled (or not) banana bread", "selftext": "https://www.isachandra.com/2011/11/marbled-banana-bread/\n\nI currently have a loaf of this going in the air fryer (no oven right now, so I'm baking on hard mode in small batches), and I have made this multiple times in regular ovens and it's always turned out well.\n\nA few tips that I've picked up, mostly through trial and error:\n\nThe easiest way to mash bananas and make sure they're really mashed and totally ripe is to mash them on a plate with a fork. They should be totally brown, super soft when you pick them up, and close to falling off the bunch. This is when they are the softest and the sweetest. And in general, if your bananas are not speckled brown, they are not ripe! Peel them, put them on a plate, grab a fork, and then mash them thoroughly. It should be really easy for you to mash them if they are ripe enough because it will be like softened butter.\n\nGenerally, everyone's ovens act differently, so I always set my timer for 5 minutes under the recommended time or the lower end of a time range (e.g., this recipe says to bake for 55 minutes, so I check it at 50 minutes, or if it would say to cook for 55-60 minutes, I would check it at 55 minutes). Use a butter knife or toothpick to check in the middle for doneness. If it does not come out clean, you will need to bake it more, probably in 5-minute increments if the top if set or in 10-minute increments if the top is still jiggly. When in doubt, set your timer for 5 minutes and check it then instead of risking over-baking.\n\nBe careful to not over-mix this recipe, as bananas can get rubbery if they are over-mixed. \"Until just incorporated\" is generally what I try to go for, which means that it may not look perfectly smooth but that's okay. In this recipe with the boiling water addition, you will need to mix it a little more to get the extra liquid mixed in, but as long as you don't keep stirring after it's mixed, you should be fine.\n\nI personally sometimes get lazy and don't do the marbling and just mix it all together in one bowl. That's really good too; you just won't get that marbled look, but the flavors will still be there.\n\nThis recipe uses table or sea salt (smaller grained salt). If you use kosher salt or larger grained salt, you may need to add more. Personally, I use table salt when baking, so I would not know the conversion ratio but keep that in mind. Just in general, know what sort of salt is being used when you see it measured out, as if you use table salt when the measurement is for kosher salt, it will turn out super salty. That happened to me once, and I learned my lesson after that!\n\nWhile this is a vegan recipe, vegan baking is really easy to adapt from generally uncomplicated non-vegan recipes (bread, muffins, etc). If the egg is there as a binding agent, flax or chia seeds make a very gelly substance when mixed with water that will act in the same way. You can also use a banana instead of an egg, but it will give a slight banana flavor (although for certain things, that's great), or you can purchase an egg replacer powder that is strictly for making and adds no flavor (much like a regular egg). As for milk substitutes, I just use soy or almond milk.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/cts7m0/vegan_marbled_or_not_banana_bread/", "created_utc": 1566447049.0, "score": 60, "author": "usedtobewonderful", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/cts7m0/vegan_marbled_or_not_banana_bread/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Sounds great, I need to make a banana bread and marbling it is a great idea and so pretty!\n\nI wanted to throw in my ultra lazy banana mashing tip.

Sometimes I'll need to add a wet ingredient or two to really get it squished up well, but it's so fast, easy, and extremely lazy. I've never encountered any rubberiness from it.\n\nBefore I had a hand mixer, I made the whole banana bread recipe in one bowl (starting again with mashing the bananas) with a potato masher. It always seemed to mix it just right. Yes I know I'm a lazy heathen, but at least I'm a lazy heathen with fresh baked goods!"]}

They make amazing easy dinners/lunches when your fridge and pantry are empty or you don't feel like cooking. Add a side of pyrogies and you've got yourself a fine meal \ud83d\ude0a", "Thank you!

They have lots of options with beans & chick peas, and a variety of sauces. They have a pretty low-dairy diet, so that should be good. As for the onions, just skip 'em if they're too much! \n\nBeans in general are a great protein. It's easy to get suckered into doing just the classics with them, but switching things up makes for great fun. Canned lentils or chick peas in chili are nice (my kid can't have kidney beans, so i had to play around). Navy beans & kidney beans in soups & stews. A handful of any beans in a salad is pretty decent. I like chickpeas because they're pretty firm & some nice cheddar cubes in a simple garden salad: lettuce & tomatoes, sometimes cucumbers. Another fun thing to do with chickpeas: make falafals as big as hamburgers. I shallow fry them in a small sized cast iron, makes them less scary. serve on a bun or pita w/ some fresh veggies. Other things to do with beans: all kinds of dip. Fresh veg & dip, grilled veg & dip. All good things. \n\nMore beans! Jamaican style rice & beans/peas. It's a complete protein. Baked beans, refried beans, bean enchiladas. I really like beans even though I eat meat. I'm sorry. It's mostly cuz I find tofu disgusting at the best of times, so I got creative with legumes. If you don't like the texture of canned beans or the tinny flavour, you can buy dry and boil them (cheaper that way, too). Just don't put salt in the water till they're as tender as you want them. If you salt the water they won't soften. Ever. I found that out the hard way. You can also sprout beans. Standard green lentils take about 12hrs to sprout, maybe a bit more. Makes them healthier. From there you can cook them or eat them as sprouts, just like regular bean sprouts (those are from mung beans, if you want to make those  yourself). \n\nCan you still eat eggs? I know they're not exactly vegetarian, but they're a good filler in a lot of things if you can still tolerate them. Hard boiled eggs can be added to a simple coleslaw or potato salad quite successfully since it blends in with the mayo. It's an Asian idea, but there are lots of ways to add eggs to soups - in thin omelet sheets, cut into strips or squares or poached eggs, dropped right into the boiling soup. They even serve soft boiled egg split over ramen. Nothing stops you from experimenting with more western style soups. \n\nI hope some of that helps :) Good luck with your new diet!

Put a teaspoon in a small mason jar. And I mean a FLAT TEASPOON. This powder is very strong and a little goes a long way.\nStep 2. Pour in some almond milk (or whatever milk you want.

Put jar in the microwave with no lid for 30-45 seconds. \nPull it out and screw on the lid nice and tight. Then shake until the contents is a pretty green color with no lumps and it's got a good foam on it. \nStep 4. Add sugar and vanilla to taste.

It's almost 3 years old at this point so it's like liquid gold. \nPut the lid back on and shake until combined.\nStep 5. Get a nice glass or whatever beverage container you're using. I put in a handful of ice and pour the contents of the jar over the ice, then add some more milk to fill the glass. \nIf you're making this hot, just forget the ice, put the jar's contents in a glass, add more milk, and then put it back in the micro wave until it's hot enough for you. If you're making it hot, don't heat the mason jar until hot because you might burn the tea powder and get a not so nice taste.

There is an American version that is cheaper but there\u2019s definitely a difference in quality. Amazon France has free shipping. This cuts down on dishes, as we\u2019ve opted for a wine fridge instead of a dishwasher when we downsized. We\u2019ve got our priorities in strict order because we both work overtime, we love our wine, and I love cooking dinner from scratch for my FDH. Y\u2019all can transfer the casserole to a greased 9x13 Pyrex, though. \n\n- 1lb of ground Italian sausage - mild or spicy (I use a blend)\n- 1 fennel bulb with fronds\n- 1 sweet onion \n- 2-3 cloves of garlic \n- 1 jar of Vodka pasta sauce \n- 4 oz. of baby spinach \n- 12 oz. pasta of choice (I\u2019ve used small and large shells, rigatoni, and a couple other types. I figure it\u2019s better when the ingredients can grab onto and fill up the pasta)\n- 8-10 oz. shredded Italian blended cheese (I mix in Monterey Jack)\n\nPreheat oven to 375. \n\nRemove the fennel fronds and set aside. Halve the bulb and remove the stems. Carve out the center core using a triangular cut. Slice horizontally into 1/2\u201d pieces. Halve and chop stems and set the fennel aside. \n\nBoil pasta in water with a pinch of salt to just before al dente, drain and set aside. I mix in some olive oil to keep it from sticking. Save 8oz. of the pasta water. \n\nWhile pasta is cooking (6-7 minutes) finely chop the onion and saut\u00e9 on low heat until transparent. About 6 minutes. \n\nWhile the onions cook, cook the sausage in a medium to large fry pan until it\u2019s no longer pink. Turn off the heat when done. \n\nWhen the onions are cooked, add the minced or pressed garlic for 1 minute or until fragrant. Add the fennel to the onions and garlic for 2-3 minutes until slightly tender. \n\nAdd the pasta, vodka sauce, baby spinach, and fennel mix to the meat pan and mix. If it\u2019s too dry, add some of the reserved water from the pasta. Transfer to a suitable baking dish. Greased if it\u2019s not Teflon. Cover with heavy aluminum foil. Cook for 25 minutes. \n\nRemove the foil and spread the cheese mix on top and bake for 5 more minutes or until the cheese is bubbling. Remove and let rest for 5-10 minutes. \n\nSprinkle the minced fennel fronds for flavor and garnish. \n\nEnjoy my favorite dish that I\u2019ve altered and perfected over the years!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/c9b7sr/my_signature_dish_comfort_food_to_ease_the_pain/", "created_utc": 1562297623.0, "score": 58, "author": "aspienonomous", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/c9b7sr/my_signature_dish_comfort_food_to_ease_the_pain/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Sounds super tasty!

{"title": "Reinvigorate your MIL's stringy turkey leftovers with this risotto recipe", "selftext": "When life hands you stringy leftover turkey - make risotto!\n\nI will start out by saying we almost never have leftover turkey, so we cook it specially for this recipe. Just get a turkey drumstick (or two), put it in a large pan and cover it with water. Add your flavourings - I usually add some onion, some home made veggie stock paste, a few mushrooms ... Don't over-flavour, because the turkey will add to the flavour when it is cooked. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer until the turkey is done. Remove from the water, and shred the meat when it's cooled. Keep the stock for the risotto.\n\nIf you are using leftovers, shred the turkey meat.\n\nNow for the risotto itself. You will need:\n\n1 chopped onion\n\n1 tsp minced garlic from a jar\n\nSome sliced mushrooms - whatever is available. I've used Swiss browns, Shiitakes and just plain white pre-sliced button mushrooms at different times.\n\nArborio rice. I use 1 cup, and that serves 3 people easily.\n\nStock. I use the turkey stock from cooking the turkey. The general rule of thumb is the rice will absorb 2 or 3 times as much liquid, so for 1 cup, I usually use about 2 or 3 cups of stock. Warm it first, if you can.\n\nA decent glug of white wine (optional)\n\nThe secret weapon - one mushroom stock cube - only to be deployed in emergencies.\n\nSome frozen peas, or other veg of your choice. I've used frozen corn in a pea shortage.\n\nNow here's how you make it:\n\nPut some oil in the bottom of a saucepan big enough to hold everything. Let it warm up, then sautee your onion first, adding your minced garlic a couple of minutes later. When they are cooked through and transparent, add the mushrooms and let them cook a minute or two. (If you have other diced fresh veg you want to use, such as carrot, celery or fennel, now is the time to add them and let them sautee too.)\n\nThen add your rice to the mix, and let that cook about a minute or so.\n\nNow start adding your stock, in small amounts. I usually add about half a cup at a time, and then stir it in. Let it cook until most of the liquid is evaporated, and what remains looks kind of thick. Then add another half a cup or so. You might also want to add your glug of white wine at some stage too. (To the pan, or to the chef, or both.)\n\nAs the rice cooks, taste the liquid and see if the flavours need adjusting. If it's lacking a certain something, this is when I bust out the emergency mushroom stock cube and add it to the risotto. If the stock cube makes it too salty, I just add some plain water at my next liquid top up until the flavour comes back into balance. (This is one of those regular-stirring-and-tasting recipes.)\n\nThe secret is to choose a temperature on the stove top that will have your risotto bubbling away, without the fear that it will catch on the bottom of the saucepan. This is about mid-point on my stove, but YMMV.\n\nI tend to add my frozen veg close to the end, and I only add my turkey right at the end when the rice is nearly done. But if you have dry leftovers, I'd be tempted to add the turkey earlier on in the cooking process and see if the liquid will re-hydrate it a bit.\n\nOnce the rice is done (nice and tender to taste), I turn the heat off and let the risotto stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/9umvfo/reinvigorate_your_mils_stringy_turkey_leftovers/", "created_utc": 1541495692.0, "score": 52, "author": "purpleprot", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/9umvfo/reinvigorate_your_mils_stringy_turkey_leftovers/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I love risotto.

{"title": "Peppermint Bark", "selftext": "With all the hoo-ha about MLM/consumer of online woo justnos using peppermint oil really inappropriately (I was trained in some herbalism/perfumery by an old-school hippie herbalist and am just shaking my head), I wanted to introduce a SAFE AND DELICIOUS way to consume TINY amounts of peppermint oil.  \n\nIt is very popular with people around the holidays.  I take it to my doctors, etc. as a holiday gift.  \n\nYou need:\n\nSome food grade peppermint oil (NOT EXTRACT) and a dropper\n\nA quarter sheet pan and some wax paper\n\nI mention these first because the food grade oil may not be the easiest to find.  I get it at a local fancy grocery that has an amazing baking and candymaking section or from King Arthur Flour.  Craft stores may have it in the candymaking section.  If your fancy grocery has other food essential oils in the baking aisle, consider asking the manager to stock it.  \n\nFor each batch:\n\n~12 oz/375 g best quality dark chocolate, chopped\n\n~16 oz/500 g white chocolate, chopped or chips\n\nCrushed hard peppermint candies, about a cup (I use 20 of the teeny tiny canes that come 30-40-60 to a box)\n\nPeppermint oil\n\nI use \"Trader Joe's Pound Plus\" bars which are 500 g, which is a little more than 1 lb (454 g), but I use 3/4 of the bar.  They are excellent chocolate and a great price.  \n\nThe peppermint candy will fuse (at least it always does in my moist winter climate) if you crush it in advance so be sure to do it as needed.  I use double ziploc baggies and a jar or bottle bottom.  Pretend it's your JustNo.  \n\nI use the microwave to melt chocolate in my quart Pyrex measures - 1 minute, stir, 1 more minute, stir vigorously, see if I need a few seconds more.  \n\n1)    Melt the 12 oz dark chocolate.  Add 5-10 drops peppermint oil.  Stir well.  \n\n2)    Line your quarter sheet pan with waxed paper and pour the chocolate in.  Spread with a spatula to cover.   Fridge or freeze till well set.  I usually let it go overnight.\n\n3)    When you're ready for part 2, crush the candies and put them in a bowl.\n\n4)    Melt the white chocolate.  Add 5-10 drops peppermint oil.  Stir well.\n\n5)    Pick the larger candy bits out of the bowl with your well washed hands.  Mix into the white chocolate.  Use about half the bowl contents.\n\n6)    Let the white chocolate cool a tiny bit and take the first layer out of the fridge.\n\n7)    Spread the white chocolate over the dark chocolate.\n\n8)    Take the reserved candy bits and dust them over the top of the bark.  You can use your well washed hands to gently press them in.  \n\n9)    Fridge or freeze till set\n\n10)    Break the bark into bits by whacking it on an edge (n.b. this works better if I have let it come to room temp for about 10 minutes) and using your hands or a knife to chop it into serving size bits.   Again, pretend it's your JustNo.  \n\nStore the bark covered/bagged in your fridge or freezer until you need it.   I make a dollar store run for small tins during holiday season and line them with waxed paper.  \n\nYou will note there is less than a quarter teaspoon of peppermint oil for about 2 lb of candy.

Layer on top of green beans. Completely cover sour cream mixture with Velveeta slices (quantity used will depend on the size of your casserole dish). Then top with crushed Ritz. \n\nYou only have to warm it to the point the cheese is melted and gooey. It can go in at different temps, so it is easy to put in the oven with your rolls or dressing.

{"title": "7-Layer Mexican style dip", "selftext": "I figured that since most of us are stuck inside cooking for ourselves, you all might appreciate a recipe to try.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSo I have been making a version of this dip for about 20 years, and it has changed quite a bit from then to now. I always feel like my latest version is my best, but of course, that is subjective.\n\nThere is little to no cooking involved depending on how you want to make it. I'm a danger to myself and others in the kitchen, and have managed to slice open my finger (twice!!) with an unserrated butter knife while washing dishes. So please excuse me for feeling this is one of my best recipes, it's one of the few things I make at all.\n\nIngredients:\n\n \u2022 Spices (optional) - Chili Powder, Onion powder, dried cilantro flakes, and Penzey's Spices Bold Taco seasoning\n\n \u2022 1 can refried beans\n\n \u2022 1 box of Rice-a-roni (Spanish Style) - alternative ingredient guacamole\n\n \u2022 ~8oz Sour Cream (I buy the 16oz size so I have enough if I need more than 8oz.)\n\n \u2022 1 16oz jar of salsa (chose your preference of heat)\n\n \u2022 1 package of bacon pieces (from the salad isle, or make your own bacon bits)\n\n \u2022 1 small can of chopped black olives\n\n \u2022 One- 2 cup pkg of finely shredded mozzarella cheese (I know! I know!)\n\nof course you can substitue your own version of these ingredients. If you want to make your own bacon pieces instead of buying them, or if you want to make a guacamole and use that instead of Rice-a-roni, it's up to you! This is about what YOU like in a dip. This is just how I make it.\n\nThe refried beans are a bit stiff to add directly to the first layer without working them a bit. Put the can of beans in a small saucepan or soup pot and add about 1/4 can of water to it to help loosen up the consistency. Mix well. Over low heat add in spices (Chili Powder, Onion Powder and Taco Seasoning) to taste. I was cautious with mine, and I used maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon of each. The Taco seasoning probably got up to 3/4 of a teaspoon.\n\nOnce that flavor has melded, take off heat and layer refried beans onto a large serving plate. I use a big monster of a plate for it.\n\nWhile the beans are cooking, you can start the Rice-a-roni. I add a few oz of the salsa to the recipe instead of the diced tomatoes called for on the side of the box. \n\nSo once the refried beans are on the plate, add the finished Rice-a-roni as the next layer. You should probably wait until this cools off before adding the 3rd layer, unless you went with Guac instead.\n\nThe third layer is sour cream.\n\nThe fourth is salsa. If I have issues with it running down the side, I poke a few holes down to the rice. it's soaks up the salsa very nicely if you use too much, or have a runny salsa. Keeping the sour cream between the two prevents the rice from becoming soggy and unedible. If it's a particularly runny salsa, you can also drain off some of the excess liquid before applying it to the previous layers. Remember this is going on a plate, not in a bowl. (I have never had issues using regular Pace chunky salsa, no draining necessary)\n\nAfter that I add in my chopped black olives and bacon bits to taste. If you like them, add lots of them. Fair warning, too much bacon can really take over. \n\nLastly cover with the finely shredded mozzarella cheese.\n\nI know I should use a better cheese, but I did say this was a Mexican -style- dip. If you want to use a taco blend to be more authentic, be my guest! The bacon bits aren't exactly standard either! ;)\n\nThe whole thing ends up looking like a big white burial mound on a plate. It's not the runny/ watery consistency of most failed layered dips if done correctly, and I have gotten RAVE reviews whenever I have taken it in to work during a pot-luck.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/fvpwci/7layer_mexican_style_dip/", "created_utc": 1586137678.0, "score": 48, "author": "Raveynfyre", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/fvpwci/7layer_mexican_style_dip/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Sounds yummy.

{"title": "Easy Bacon Bourbon Brownies (box mix!)", "selftext": "I made these for a friend's wedding cookie table; the last night before I had to drive seven hours with a  hundred dozen cookies in my car, I still felt like I hadn't done enough. What do people like to eat? I thought. Chocolate! And bacon! And anything with alcohol in it!\n\nThe \"recipe,\" such as it is, is very simple:\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n* Boxed fudge brownie mix (dark chocolate mix might be okay too, but I like fudge)\n* Good-quality bacon\n* Bourbon (I got a couple of those little dollar-fifty, sneak-it-into-church plastic mini bottles)\n* Eggs as required for the number of boxes of mix\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Dice the bacon into about 1/3 in squares. Frozen bacon works best for  this, it's easiest to chop it all at once without it sliding around.\n2. Fry the bacon to _nearly_ finished.  If you want to mix the bacon into the brownies directly, cook half of it all the way, and half of it only halfway.\n3. Drain off and save the bacon grease; cool.\n4. Taking the recipe from the box, prepare as normal with SUBSTITUTIONS: a) For _at least half_ of the water, and as much as all of it, substitute bourbon.  Half bourbon, half water was more than enough for the flavor to really come out. b) for as much of the vegetable oil as possible, substitute cooled (not solidified, but room-temperature) bacon grease.\n5. If you want to mix the previously completely-cooked bacon directly into the batter, do so immediately after adding the egg and liquids. Do not over stir.\n6. Pour batter into greased pan.\n7. Sprinkle half-cooked bacon across the top of the batter.  It will settle somewhat, but still be visible on top of the brownies.  Put directly into oven and cook as instructed by the box, checking occasionally.\n8. The box always says, let cool completely before cutting, and I don't think most of us do that. But for this, with the bacon bits, you really _do_ have to let it reach room temperature before cutting it, unless you wanna just sit there with the pan and a fork and no one else but your conscience between you and the consequences (a preferred way of consuming brownies any time).\n\nGOOD WITH: Vanilla ice cream or roasted pears", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/8nym9t/easy_bacon_bourbon_brownies_box_mix/", "created_utc": 1527918611.0, "score": 47, "author": "RememberKoomValley", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/8nym9t/easy_bacon_bourbon_brownies_box_mix/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Chocolate chips!

{"title": "Divan Sauce etc.", "selftext": "Somebody over on r/justnomil asked for this. I'm sorry that I don't know measurements. Ordinarily I can't cook without them, but this is something my mom taught me, and she eyeballed everything.\n\nI use this sauce for a lot of things besides Chicken Divan, though that's the dish I learned to make it for. It's fantastic on top of veggies, or on baked potatoes, and I use it to make tuna and chicken casserole. I don't have any exact measurements, sorry - but I'll do my best to be as clear as I can. The lovely thing about this is that it's pretty easy to adjust to your tastes. The only real downside to it? It's really, really bad for you.\n\nSo - I begin by dumping a can or two of cream of chicken soup in my big cast iron skillet. You can also use one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom or cream of broccoli - I prefer cream of chicken, but that's really a taste thing.\n\nAs that starts to warm up and bubble, I add a good sized (I use a wooden spoon, and it's probably about a cup, but I've used both more and less depending on taste results, how much sauce I need, etc.) of mayonnaise. Then I add in a generous squirt of mustard - I'd guess it at 2 tablespoons, YMMV.\n\nAt this point, as you stir all of this together, if you taste it you should get a smooth tang from the mayonnaise, and the mustard taste should come through. The mayonnaise smooths it, the mustard sharpens the taste. If you can't taste the mustard add a little more. It shouldn't overpower, but the flavor should definitely come through.\n\nOnce you've reached that point with the sauce, you add the curry (I know some folks add garlic, etc. I've always just stuck with curry. Experiment - this is a really forgiving sauce.) I use a mild curry, but if you like heat, feel free to use the hot curry. Curry and mustard go together remarkably well. I'd start with at least a couple teaspoons if you're using mild, then taste and adjust as you like.\n\nYou want the sauce to be simmering before you add the cheese. I use either shredded colby/colby-jack, or sharp cheddar. I add the cheese a handful at a time, stirring until it's fully incorporated and melted. You want to stir and stir and stir to keep the sauce from breaking and the cheese from turning into goo. Taste, and add more cheese if you like. At this point you can also still easily add more spices, but remember it takes a few minutes for heat to bloom the flavor, so add, give it a minute or two of stirring, taste, then add more as you like.\n\nBonus curry use:\n\nTuna Salad\n\nI only use tuna packed in spring water - it's a texture thing.  To that I'll add just enough mayo to get it to cling together. Awesome Roomie adds chopped celery and onion when he makes it, I don't. I like it both ways. Then it's a touch of mustard, curry and shredded cheese (I like sharp cheddar with this) and it never hurts to shake the parm over this - either into the salad itself, or on top of sandwiches, especially if you intend to broil them. We tend to make this stuff up in bulk, for days when I'm super low on spoons. Not only is it great toasted on bread, but it's also pretty good scooped up with crackers for *really* low-spoon days.\n\nEdited to add: It occurred to me that folks might want to know how I do the actual Divan dish.\n\nBasically, I use this dish to use up leftover chicken - especially from rotisserie chickens, or leftover turkey. Get yourself a bunch of cooked chicken, cut into decently bite-sized pieces. I usually add at least a couple cups worth.  You can either mix that up with the sauce, or add some frozen broccoli and/or cauliflower to a casserole dish. Pour sauce over the top, and bake in the oven until veggies are done. I assume you can also use the fresh stuff, but I'd suggest steaming it so that it's still nice and crisp, then add to the sauce. You don't want the veggies cooked so much they turn into mush. We usually eat it over rice. It's excellent comfort food.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/al65mu/divan_sauce_etc/", "created_utc": 1548803930.0, "score": 45, "author": "Gennywren", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/al65mu/divan_sauce_etc/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This sounds amazing!

Also I'll add the latin names of things, so you guys have an easier time to look them up, since it's the universal name of plants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beef:**\n\nI take whatever beef I can find: beef shin, ross rib, ox tail if I don't plan on using the meat.\n\nIf I'll be serving chunks of meat in the broth (like an Alt-Wiener Suppentopf) I'll use beef shank or (if I'm feeling really fancy) \"Tafelspitz\" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafelspitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafelspitz))\n\n\\[Basically I'll use every cut around 11, 12 , 13, in that diagram - think it's also called \"beef topside\"\\]\n\nThe weight of the cut should be around 500-700g.\n\nIf there's fat on the beef, leave it, since it's essential for the taste (and once the broth is cold, the fat will be solid and can be removed easily).\n\nIf I'm using lean beef like Tafelspitz, I always add a small piece of \"cheap beef\" just for the sake of getting some fat into my broth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Also needed:**\n\n* 2-3 (depends on the size of the cut) pieces of marrowbone (basically slices of bones with bone marrow)\n* 1 big normal peeled onion - cut in half\n* 1 chinese garlic (the round one) or 2-3 garlic cloves - peel them but, leave them whole\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Spices:**\n\n* 2-3 dried laurel leaves (Laurus nobilis, again depending on the size of the leaf)\n* peppercorn (and ground pepper -> to add to the broth if not enough)\n* juniper berries\n* lovage (I use the dried, ground one)\n* salt\n* 1 paper tea filter\n\n**Vegetables:** *(heavily depending on size, so use your common sense for the actual amount)*\n\n* 3 carrots\n* 1 leek\n* 1/4 celery root (Apium graveolens)\n* 1 small parsley root (Petroselinum crispum)\n* parsley leaves (2-3 stalks)\n\n**Seasoning:** *(experiment with the amount, it all depends on your preferred flavour)*\n\nGet the paper tea filter, fill it with 10-15 crushed black peppercorns, roughly 1.5 tablespoons of lovage (or more, you'll need to experiment with this one), 4-5 juniper berries, break the laurel leaves into smaller pieces and add them ... tie a knot into it to keep it closed.\n\n**For the base stock:**\n\nHeat up the pot, add a tiny bit of oil (sunflower f.e.), sear the bones and the onion halves. As soon as the bones are browned, fill up the pot with hot water, add the meat and the garlic.\n\nAlso add enough salt, so that the water is just a tiny bit too salty. Bring to a boil, then take away the heat and let it simmer (just barely not cooking).\n\nThrow your little seasoning teabag into the pot. Put the lid on the pot and from there on just keep on simmering the broth for 3-5 hours, while checking and tasting it once in a while. \\[I always have to add more salt and pepper to it.\\]\n\nIf necessary, skim the foam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In the meantime, prepare the following:** *(roughly 1 hour before the broth is done cooking)*\n\nPeel the carrots, the celery root and the parsley root, cut them into mouth sized pieces (you want to be able to eat those with a spoon, also since I HATE the taste of the parsley root itself,  I just toss the whole thing into the broth and remove it before serving, it's essential for the flavour though). Wash the leek, cut into 5-10 cm long pieces (you can cut them anyway you want, but this way the leek won't fall apart while cooking and you won't end up with lose ropey leek-strings floating around).\n\nOnce you're satisfied with the outcome of your \"base broth\", toss in the vegetables + parsley leaves and let them simmer for another hour (they should be soft, but not too soft/fall apart). Keep tasting and adding salt if needed. I found, that salt is the key for a tasty broth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're losing too much water while simmering, just add more water to the pot. But keep an eye on the taste of the broth. Add more salt if needed. I found that if I taste the broth and it's lacking something, it has always been salt ...\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/9mqmx8/homemade_beef_broth/", "created_utc": 1539102367.0, "score": 46, "author": "Rochine", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/9mqmx8/homemade_beef_broth/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Sounds amazing!

I tend to reduce things to the most basic process and then play with it from there.\n\n2. I like to use lots of different beans, like a different kind for each can (1 can pinto beans with chili sauce, 1 can white beans in chili sauce, 1 can black beans, 1 can red kidney beans, for example).

{"title": "Keto Chicken Crust Pizza", "selftext": "So, I\u2019ve been craving pizza for a while now but I don\u2019t want to cheat (again) and have a traditional pizza and am too cheap to buy one of those Real Good Pizzas at Kroger. I don\u2019t like the popular Fathead Pizza Crust because of texture issues. This one, though, is actually pretty satisfying in all the ways. It doesn\u2019t feel like a real pizza, but it still tastes (and feels) awesome in its own way. I\u2019m not making this until tonight, so I\u2019ll update then with pictures of the finished product then.\n\nOriginally, the recipe I found for this called for a 10 oz can of chicken that you then drained, spread out on a baking sheet and dried in the oven for 10 minutes before using.

Also, Alfredo sauce fits well on this crust flavor wise). I will be using GV sauce, mozzarella, bacon pieces, and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on mine. The second will probably be just cheese or cheese and pepperoni.\n\nMethod\n\n* Preheat oven to 450 F.\n* Pick all the meat off the bones. I just eat the skin as I\u2019m picking it off as it doesn\u2019t work in the recipe. Save the carcass to make broth with.\n* Toss the meat, eggs, Parmesan, and seasoning in a food processor. Whirl around until the chicken is pretty well cut up and everything is mixed well. You DON\u2019T want a paste, so stop just before you get to that point.\n* Remove mixture from processor and divide in half.\n* Between 2 sheets of parchment paper, pat or roll out the mixture into a 12\u201d circle on a pizza pan or baking sheet.\n* Remove top sheet of parchment paper, and bake one at a time until the top of the crust begins to brown.\n* Remove from oven, place another piece of parchment paper on top, flip the crust, and remove what is now the top piece of paper.\n* Top with 1/4 C of your chosen sauce and your desired toppings.\n* Return to oven and bake until cheese is melty and toppings are done to your preferences.\n* Remove, cut into desired slices, and eat.\n\nCarbs per slice will depend on what you\u2019ve put on it, but the crust itself is almost zero carbs.

{"title": "The Pan Chicken and Risotto Even My JustNOFMIL Liked", "selftext": "I posted earlier about Holiday Horror (JustNoFMIL) liking something I cooked and being off-put when she realized that I had indeed made it: it was not left over from a night out. Someone asked me for the recipe, so I figured I would post both the chicken and the risotto recipe here!\n\nNote that I don't measure anything anymore when I cook this dish- I eyeball it because I've made it so many times. The measurements here are a mix of what the original recipe says, and what I have found works best.\n\nChicken and Pan Sauce (Serves 2)  \nIngredients:  \n\\- 4 thin-sliced chicken cutlets  \n\\-1/2 cup of white cooking wine  \n\\-1/2-1 cup of chicken stock  \n\\-2-3 tbsps of flour  \n\\-salt and pepper  \n\\- 2 tbsps of butter  \n\\-2 tbsps olive oil\n\nInstructions:  \n1) Mix flour, salt, and pepper (to taste) in a large plastic bag. Add chicken cutlets to the bag and shake to coat well with flour  \n2) Melt 1 tbsp of butter and add the olive oil to a hot pan. Remove chicken from bag, shake off excess flour, and cook for about 3-5 minutes (depends on thickness) until golden-brown on one side. Flip and cook until golden brown on other side.   \n3) Remove chicken from pan and place on a plate. Deglaze pan with cooking wine and reduce by about half. Once reduced, add remaining tbsp of butter and chicken stock. Reduce sauce by half, then add back the chicken and any juices from the plate. Cook chicken in the sauce until coated. Serve alongside risotto (which is amazing with the pan sauce).\n\nBasic Risotto (Serves 2... Unless you like risotto as much as I do, then make some extra)  \nIngredients:  \n\\- One yellow onion (diced)  \n\\- 1-1/2 cup of Arborio rice (I usually guesstimate)  \n\\- 1/2 cup of white cooking wine  \n\\- 1-2 cups of chicken stock  \n\\- 1/2-1 cup of Parmesan cheese (or however much you like)  \n\\- 2-3 tbsps of butter  \n\\- salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:  \n1) Heat and melt butter in a pot. Add chopped onion and saute until slightly translucent and aromatic. Add arborio rice and toss with the onions, until the grains are coated with butter and lightly toasted.   \n2) Add cooking wine and stir. Cook down until there is almost no liquid remaining.  \n3) Begin adding chicken stock, bit by bit, cooking down between each addition until you can stir and see the bottom of the pot. After a few additions, when the rice has increased in size, start testing the grains. Taste them until they are soft, but not mushy. The texture is really up to you- I like mine a little softer, some like it more al dente.  \n4) Once the rice is cooked to just about your preference, turn off the heat. Add the remaining butter and cheese, and then salt and pepper. NOTE- the cheese is salty, so I would recommend adding the butter and cheese, tasting, and then adding the salt and pepper so as not to over-season the risotto. \n\nI sometimes add mushrooms to my risotto, which is amazing. If you want to add any other veggies, I would recommend adding them after the onions or with the onions, depending on how fast your veggies of choice cook. If you are adding meat (I used to add chicken before I paired this with the pan sauce dish), cook that BEFORE the onions, and add the onion when the meat is almost cooked through. \n\nI hope you all enjoy!

Fold into the risotto at the end and heat it through.\n\nIn a separate pan, add some diced ham and corn (I used the steam in bag corn, it is already buttered).

F. Line a 9\u00d713-inch baking pan with foil and grease the foil well with butter or cooking spray. In a large, microwave-safe bowl, combine the chopped chocolate and butter. Microwave in intervals of 1 minute at 50% power until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth, stirring in between intervals. Whisk in the sugar, eggs and vanilla until incorporated. Stir in the flour and salt just until combined. Spread about half of the brownie batter in the bottom of the prepared pan in an even layer. Bake for 18 minutes. Remove from the oven (keep the oven on!) and let the brownies cool for 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, add the chopped pecans (if using) to a medium skillet over medium heat. Toast, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and light golden brown. Remove from the heat and set aside. To make the caramel filling, combine the caramels and cream in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds at 50% power. Stir. Repeat the process, keeping a close eye on the mixture as it can burn very easily (make sure you use low heat in the microwave). Continue the microwave process until the caramels and cream are melted and combined. Stir in half of the pecans to the caramel mixture. Immediately spread the caramel mixture over the bottom brownie layer. Scoop the remaining brownie batter in spoonfuls over the caramel layer and spread it evenly across the caramel layer (spooning the batter in piles over the caramel will help to get an even layer of batter over the caramel). Sprinkle the chocolate chips and the remaining pecans on top of the final brownie layer. Bake for 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before slicing and serving. I found the brownies sliced easier once they had been cooled and refrigerated for an hour or two.\nLift the brownies from the pan using the edges of the foil.

(Easy way to determine soft ball stage: get a candy thermometer and cook until the mixture reaches 235\u00b0 -  245\u00b0F (113\u00b0 - 118\u00b0 C). Harder way: drop some flip into a glass of cold water and see if you can form it into a ball.)  \n\nThen turn off the flame and beat until it starts to harden.

Macaroni! This is knife & fork macaroni - it's meant to be thick like lasagna.\n\nIngredients:\n* Two boxes Mac & cheese (I get the cheap cheddar powder kind)\n* Half cup spinach\n* One red bellpepper\n* Basil (I have an herb garden so I cut off a medium spring\n* Rosemary (same here!)\n* 4 cloves of garlic\n* Olive oil\n* Milk (if that's the kind of Mac & cheese you have)\n* Mozzarella\n\nCrumb topping:\n* Parmesan cheese\n* Panko bread crumbs (any will do, even crackers!)\n* 1 tbsp butter\n* Garlic salt\n\nOkay, I know it's a lot of garlic, but this thing will be baked three times over, and each time the spices will get weaker.  \n\nDirections:\n* Boil water, *then* add noodles.  No shortcuts! The noodles bake again, so you *really* don't want them overcooked and mushy.  \n* While water is boiling, get your ingredients prepped.  Cut the spinach & bell pepper, and set aside.  \n* Fill a cup or small bowl with 2 tbsp of olive oil.  Put your cut up herbs in it (basil, rosemary, garlic).  Not doing fresh herbs? Add the sprinkled stuff! It preserves the smell fo the fresh stuff, and releases the aromatics of the bought stuff.  \n* When the noodles are *almost* done, strain *most* of the water out.  You need like 1/2c to 1c of pasta water left - it helps everything stick together.  \n* *Turn the damn burner off so you don't burn yourself!* \n* Add spinach, bell peppers, herbs and mix well. Save the glass the herbs were relaxing in.  \n* Add your boxed cheese mix. \n* Add milk, but omit the butter and oil.  Skip this step if you have the fancy liquid gold Mac & cheese.  \n* Add 2 cups mozzarella, a little bit at a time.  Things will start getting THICK.  \n* Adjust milk to cheese ratio depending on desired consistency.  Too watery? Let it cook on low until it thickens up.  You want this pretty thick and gooey.  Err on the side of more cheese - it'll still be gooey after the second heating.\n* Once mixed, dump it all in a pretty baking pan.  * Turn your broiler on high.\n* In a separate bowl, mix 1/2 cup panko, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1 tbsp of garlic salt.  Or don't measure.  You want enough that you think it'll cover the whole top.  \n* Melt the butter and add it into the crumb mixture.  You may need another pad of butter depending on your crumb choice. I melted the butter in the same bowl that the herbs & olive oil were in.  \n* Using your hands, sprinkle it on top of the macaroni. Add some cheddar cheese if you really want, but I didn't want to go overboard on the top.  \n* Set the pan the middle to low rack in the oven.  Broil until the top is lightly browned.  Takes about 2-3 minutes on my oven.  It's ok if it's not the awesome final brown color.  \n* Reheat at friend's house at 400ish for 10 minutes.  It will brown the rest of the way and make the house smell AMAZING!

{"title": "\u201cRacists Bane\u201d Creamy Roasted Garlic Hummus with a Gooey Garlic Swirl", "selftext": "I posted a story in r/JNMIL and I was asked to post my racist GMIL thwarting hummus recipe here. So, here you go, it\u2019s effing delicious. \n\n\nWe need:\n1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas (drained and rinsed) or 1 and 1/2 cups (250 grams) cooked chickpeas\n\n1/4 cup (60 ml) FRESH lemon juice. It\u2019s about one large lemon\u2019s worth\n\n1/4 cup (60 ml) well-stirred tahini\n\n6 whole heads of garlic\n\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n\nAbout 10 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n2 to 3 tablespoons water\n\n\nIf you really want the creamiest hummus of all time, you\u2019re going to want to peel your chick peas. I didn\u2019t do this and my hummus was still deliciously creamy but if you really like the creamiest hummus ever, cook your own chick peas and take the skins off of them. \n\nPrepping the garlic:\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Take all six HEADS of garlic and remove some of the outer papery skin. Then, slice 1/4 of an inch off the top of the heads. Place the heads in foil cut side up and pour a tablespoon of olive oil over the top, then wrap each head individually in the foil so that they won\u2019t leak. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-45 minutes or until the cloves are golden brown and gooey. Let them cool before removing the softened cloves from the garlic husks because they will burn the crap out of your fingers. You can use these soft, flavorful caramelized garlic cloves for all sorts of things. Like a spread on toast, in pasta sauce, as a marital aid. \n\nThis is the most important step to getting creamy hummus: \n\nMake sure you mix your tahini before you use it. It has a tendency to separate. Using a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process for another minute. Continue to blend until the tahini and lemon juice combine and \u201ccream\u201d. It will happen pretty fast and it will look fluffier and creamier. This makes the resulting hummus have that creamy consistency.  \n\nNow you can add your cumin, the cloves from THREE of the roasted heads of garlic, a pinch of salt and combine them with the tahini and lemon juice until smooth. \n\nAdd half of your chickpeas and blend until smooth. Then add the second half and blend until smooth. You can add a couple of table spoons of water (one at a time) if the hummus is too thick for your taste, or if the hummus isn\u2019t creamy enough. I used ice water and I think it helped. \n\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the gooey delicious caramelized roasted garlic cloves from the three remaining heads of garlic with  a little salt, pepper, and just enough olive oil to make a spread type of thing. You want it to be the consistency of softened butter or jam. You can swirl this mixture throughout your hummus or just plop it on top, whatever you feel like doing. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/8mbrtl/racists_bane_creamy_roasted_garlic_hummus_with_a/", "created_utc": 1527356853.0, "score": 34, "author": "Bearadith", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/8mbrtl/racists_bane_creamy_roasted_garlic_hummus_with_a/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thanks for this!!

{"title": "Vinegar braised chicken with grains and greens", "selftext": "On a friend's recommendation I got a copy of the book \"Dining In\" by Alison Roman.  It's a great inspiring cookbook that made me want to GET IN THE KITCHEN after years of not cooking much due to illness.\n\nOne dish I have made a couple times now is a variation on her Vinegar Braised Chicken with Farro and Watercress.  I'll tell you what I did with the recipe before I post the link:\n\n* Chicken legs (whole) not cut up chicken.  I go to the organic butcher.  \n\n*  I use more than 1 TBS oil, I think recipe writers do that to keep calorie counts down.  3 to start and eyeball it at the toasting stage after scraping the pan.   I am also not stingy with the salt at the browning and toasting stages.  \n\n* 1 cup barley for the farro (cook time will be about an hour so start your checks/plan active stirring time accordingly).  \n\n* Arugula or parsley for the cress because that's what I had around.  It needs a green with a little bite because it's rich.  \n\n- I leave the yuzu koshu out because that made the grains really crazy spicy in a way I found inedible.  If you have it and like HOT STUFF, I'd say start with a half teaspoon.  That stuff is powerful.  I like the idea of making something so good with simple salt/pepper/vinegar.  \n\nIt is lip smacking good.  If you are familiar with Samin Nosrat's principles of \"Salt Fat Acid Heat\", you'll know it's got it all.\n\nThe last time I did it, I added about 12 oz chopped mushrooms at the toasting stage (toast for 3 minutes, add mushrooms and a little more oil and do a basic saute for a few minutes, add vinegar and water and put the chicken in).    Carrots (at the start) or peas (at the end) would be good in this as well.  \n\nI'm going to try it with rice at some point (cooking time obviously will be reduced).  \n\nIf the grain is tasting a little dull when you eat it, a splash of vinegar should help.  It should taste a little salty, a little toasty, and a little bright.  \n\n[Alison Roman's Vinegar Braised Chicken](http://www.health.com/recipes/vinegar-braised-chicken-with-farro-and-watercress)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/8pmk0d/vinegar_braised_chicken_with_grains_and_greens/", "created_utc": 1528484322.0, "score": 25, "author": "BerkeleyFarmGirl", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/8pmk0d/vinegar_braised_chicken_with_grains_and_greens/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["So how on earth does adding 4 cups of water and covering not turn this into a soupy mess?

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for vegetarian version.\n\n----\n\nBoil the asparagus an appropriate time. I found just bringing it to a boil, waiting five minutes, turning off the heat, and putting it aside a while was enough.\n\nDice chicken breasts (if using) and slice mushrooms. In a large pan or pot, fry both in about 1 tbsp of butter until nicely browned. Add about 3 tbsp soy sauce, a good sprinkling of celery salt, and a little black pepper.  If making vegetarian version, add another 4 tbsp soy sauce, to add a meatier taste.\n\nAbout now, preheat oven to 200\u00b0C.\n\nWhen done, remove chicken and mushrooms from pan, but keep any oil left behind.  Have 1 pint milk (20 fl oz - this here's a British pint) measured out, and ready at hand.   Make a roux by melting 3 tbsp of butter in the pan used to cook the chicken/mushrooms, and, over a medium heat, add about 1/4 cup or so of flour, stirring constantly for about 5 minutes until bubbly and smoothly mixed in.  Add milk and stir. Add chicken bouillon cube, and maybe a little  celery salt. Let cook over a medium heat until mixture thickens, maybe 5-10 minutes - I didn't time it -  making sure milk doesn't burn to bottom of pan (it's unlikely to unless you badly screw up mixing the roux in).  If using, stir in grated parmesan once it thickens.  Either way, remove from heat  at this point. \n\nSlice asparagus into 1\" pieces, discarding any woody parts (generally the bottoms of the stems; you'll know when cutting it), and add with chicken and mushrooms to white sauce. \n\nLine a 9\"x15\" pan with a prerolled pastry if you haven't already. Pour mixture into it, spreading it out evenly. fold edges of pastry over the top of the mixture.

Season well with bullion and black pepper (or if youre feeling fancy subsititue an additional tomato, quarterd, an onion,quartered, a handful of smashed garlic and the juice of two limes seasoned with salt. If you aren't doing the fancy route skip the salt-bullion powder has plenty, but really it makes an awesome broth). Fill with water until just covered or you run out of room.

Cook until the marinade has thickened and reduced to about 1/3; about 10 minutes.

{"title": "Turkey Brine", "selftext": "This is another recipe based off an Alton Brown recipe. This one does not include cooking directions though because I've recently run across some new ideas on cooking turkeys that differ from the traditional 350 Fahrenheit for a number of hours (i.e. start at 500 for 30 minutes, turn down to 350 to finish). I'm also partial to NOT stuffing the bird but I know many people are.  I also find that a turkey that has soaked in brine cooks a little bit faster than a turkey that hasn't so timing has been tricky for me the last couple of times.\n\nAs for the \"container\" I use for my turkey brine, I actually went to the big orange hardware store and bought a new 5 gallon bucket, brought it home and washed it thoroughly, and only use it for brine. It's worked well so far. I also regularly \"thaw\" my turkey in the brine solution over the period of a couple days and have not found there to be any difference in saltiness.\n\nEdit: I always remember this stuff later...lol. My regular grocery store did not carry candied (or crystalized) ginger so I ended up getting that at Joe the Trader's place. Everything else was at my regular grocer.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 gallon vegetable or chicken broth (not low sodium)\n* 1 cup salt\n* \u00bd cup brown sugar (light or dark)\n* 1 Tbsp whole peppercorns\n* \u00bd Tbsp allspice berries\n* \u00bd Tbsp candied ginger\n* 1 gallon ice water\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. In a pot large enough to hold at least 2\u00bd gallons, add broth and place over high heat. Add salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and ginger. Continue to cook until all the salt and sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until it's completely chilled.\n2. Place turkey in a container large enough that the brine can cover the turkey. Remove brine from refrigerator and add the gallon of ice water. Stir to mix and pour mixture over turkey making sure turkey is completely submerged. Leave turkey in brine for no less than 6-8 hours.

Put the frozen jar in the fridge the night before you want to use it so it unfreezes enough for you to scrape it into a saucepan.  \n\nYou will have pre made gravy on the day.

{"title": "Corn casserole", "selftext": "Hi everyone. Around this time last year a member of our JustNO community was asking for ideas for an easy casserole. One of those casseroles that doesn't require much thought or effort and most importantly, doesn't leave a ton of dirty dishes. This casserole is one of those recipes. \n\nExtra back story about my love for the dish will be posted below after the recipe. Enjoy! \n\n>**Corn Macaroni Cheese Casserole** \n\n>*Note: The base recipe calls for one unit of each ingredient. This makes it super easy to double or triple the dish.* \n\n>**Ingredients**\n\n>* 1 can whole kernel corn, with liquid\n* 1 can cream style corn\n* 1 cup small uncooked seashell pasta\n* 1 stick butter (1/2 cup), cut into pieces\n* 1 cup cubed processed cheese (aka Velveeta) \n\n\n>**Directions**\n\n>*Tip - I like to use one of the foil baking dishes. This is 1 less dish for you to wash and no anxiety about losing a good baking dish*\n\n>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\n>In a medium baking dish, mix the whole kernel corn, cream style corn, uncooked pasta, butter, and processed cheese.\n\n>Bake, covered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, stir, and continue baking 30 minutes, or until the pasta is tender but firm.\n\n**Additional back story**\n\nI grew up in the Midwest and this casserole has always been part of our family Thanksgiving. My Aunt made it each year. After I moved to a desert state in the Southwest, I would crave this side dish. My aunt was happy to share the recipe with me. The first year I made it, I told my friends that I would bring my corn casserole that has Velveeta and Macaroni. None of them really knew much about casseroles bc apparently they're only a staple in the Midwest diet. They tried to say that a corn and mac & cheese dish was weird and they probably wouldn't like it. My response has always been the same, \"Do you like corn? Do you like Velveeta mac? You'll like this too.\"\n\nAnyone who has ever tried it has been a corn casserole convert. Several years ago, my husband and I moved to his home state. For our first Thanksgiving with his family, I said I was bringing this as my offering. His family also thought it would be a weird dish but they chalked it up as another one of those weird things white people like (they're Mexican). It has proved to be wildly popular. My casserole was the first thing we ran out of. The 2nd year I doubled my recipe and it was still gone in record time. I tripled it the next year and we still ran out. \n\nMy husband and I stopped going to family holidays because drama. Our niece (DH's sister's daughter) called me the night before Thanksgiving last year and begged me to share the recipe with her bc \"it's the only Thanksgiving food worth eating.\" I couldn't agree more. \n\nI love my niece and I remember how excited I was when my aunt shared the recipe with me. It made me feel less homesick to have that comfort food from back home. I don't think niece made it last year but she definitely came to my house the next day and went straight to the fridge to raid my leftovers. She messaged me earlier in the week asking for the recipe again. I'll share it with her every year just so I can fantasize about the family going through casserole withdrawal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/e36wra/corn_casserole/", "created_utc": 1574987524.0, "score": 12, "author": "HypocriteEnRaged", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/e36wra/corn_casserole/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}
