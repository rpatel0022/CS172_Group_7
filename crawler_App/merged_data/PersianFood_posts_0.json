{"title": "Koobideh in a basket Pros and Cons:", "selftext": "I typically utilize my wide skewers for my koobideh but I decided to try one of these cages that I found at my local market to help quicken the prep time.\nThere were a few pros and cons.\nPro: \n1. Faster prep in terms of meat placement inside cage.\n2. No need for grill grates so I removed them (they are rusted up and nasty anyways. Even though I just replaced them last year.\n3. As a result of removing the grates, more heat from the flame so thats good. Cooks fast.\n4. No need to really micromanage like you have to do with skewers. The meat will not fall out. \n5. It cooked evenly and the kebabs tasted perfect just like with a skewer. I made sure the meat was consistent in thickness during insertion in basket.\n6. The meat was easily removed from the basket after cooking.\n\nCons:\n1. I think this device was made in China unfortunately. After I finished cooking, two of the baskets cross bars detached from the frame. Not sure how I\u2019ll fix it. Thats very annoying and the result of a cheap junk made in china.\n2. It was pretty heavy fully loaded but I have good grip strength so it wasn\u2019t an issue for me to flip it but I can see it being an issue for someone with weaker grip and forearm strength.\n3. It was a bit messier when flipping because the juices drip while flipping too so you have to try to keep it over the open grill.\n4. The wood handle has a red colored dye that was leeching into the palm of my hand. I have no clue why this wood handle is dyed in such a cheap and poor manner.\n5. As stated above, flipping is a a bit tricky but it was not impossible.\n6. Cleaning took slightly longer then my skewers. I only used dawn dish soap water and green scotch bright pad to clean and hang dry.\n\nOverall, the experience of using this basket was good and I would like to continue cooking my kebabs in this manner because I believe that overall, it was faster to set up. If anyone would halpen to know where to source higher quality cages that are not chinese in origin I would love to know where to purchase them from. I am not opposed to single kebab length baskets either.

When I stay at his flat he does all of the cooking because I don\u2019t know how (which I am slightly embarrassed of)\n\nHis favourite dish is Gormeh Sabzi and Saffron rice with Tahdig and I would love nothing more than to be able to make his favourite food for him while he is at work (he\u2019s a paramedic) so that he can come home and relax but I have no idea what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m feeling somewhat overwhelmed with the idea of giving it a try. Can anyone help? Do you have any advice for me? I just want to make him happy \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/persianfood/comments/1b7wpmi/i_want_to_cook_for_my_persian_boyfriend/", "created_utc": 1709721851.0, "score": 30, "author": "Independent_Dress209", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/persianfood/comments/1b7wpmi/i_want_to_cook_for_my_persian_boyfriend/", "html_title": ""}

Usually I just make him some kateh, and he is an Ali-mausti already so he likes it with a few dollops of yogurt. If I'm lucky I can get him to eat a little chicken with it. And if he's in really bad shape and not hydrating, I'll fill one of his water bottles up with broth and we call it his soup cup and he's more apt to drink it.\n\nWhen I was little, my mom made chicken broth with just a tiny bit of angel hair pasta, parsley, and love. I still love just a hot mug of chicken broth and lime or lemon when I feel run down.\n\nWhat did you get as a child? Do you make it for yourself now when youre sick, or for your kids if you have any?\n\nStrangely, I don't remember getting the ol' chai and nabot when I had tummy aches lol.\n\nI also only realized recently having gone to the doctor for my child that the typical B.R.A.T diet that is prescribed with stomach issues stands for banana, rice, apple sauce and TOAST.

I LIKE the taste of lamb, it's not about not wanting lamb to taste like lamb, but it has to be in moderation.\n\nWhat do you do in Iranian cooking that reduces that gameyness?

Added a \\~ 3:1 walnut/almond mix, let the oils come out, added water. let it simmer for 30-40 min, added pomegranate paste waited \\~ 1h, added some honey, because it was a little bitter. waited a little longer and that's it.\n\nthank you :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/persianfood/comments/khtyiw/how_to_make_the_best_fesenjan_looking_for_tips/", "created_utc": 1608596593.0, "score": 14, "author": "tabid_", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/persianfood/comments/khtyiw/how_to_make_the_best_fesenjan_looking_for_tips/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Are barberries sold in persian grocery stores real barberries?", "selftext": "I am very fond of the taste and colour when I cook basmati rice. I think they taste better than raisins in a pilaf. As I live in a  suburban Canadian community of many Persians, there are several grocrey stores that sell them. Previously I have bought these bulk and was happy with their taste. But the same Persian shop in Coquitlam (Urban Gate) no longer sells them by the scoop.\n\nToday when shopping there I noticed that they had two different brands. Both I believe were 237 grams. All prices are in Canadian dollars...\n\n\\-  cheap, repackaged in Canada (Ontario if I recall correctly).  I didn't buy them because they were smaller, had very much darker and lighter ones both, but the berries looked to be of inferior quality (not something I would use for a special ocassion). I did not note country of origin. It even looked as if they had been coated with an oil (as most commercial cranberries get done with, with sugar!). I have not taste-tested these. $4.75 or so\n\n\\-  expensive, from Iran. Both lighter and darker ones (about 50% of each, but no really dark ones), more even shape than the cheaper ones. Tart with flavour that sped to my neck glands with glee. Cranberry-like aroma. Company is Saharkhiz Saffron in Mashbad. $7.99\n\nAccording to my preliminary reading, the botanical (Latin) name of real barberry is Barbarum vulgaris. However, one of the less desirable tasting goji berries (wolfberries) popular in Chinese cooking is Lycium barbarum, which makes me wonder whether these are them.\n\nSo, is it just a matter of good quality (e.g. fresher) versus not so good quality or are the cheaper 'barberries' in fact not barberries at all - in the same way that Cinamomum cassia is not Cinnamomum verum (real cinnamon from Sri Lanka)?\n\nMaybe I can save some money by buying the cheaper ones, and they will prove just as tasty. Maybe they are even more nutritious. But I was turned off by the shrivelled appearance compared to the Iranian ones -- which for all I know are \\*also\\* not true barberries!\n\nWhat say you?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/persianfood/comments/b1lj6b/are_barberries_sold_in_persian_grocery_stores/", "created_utc": 1552691222.0, "score": 12, "author": "HermesHermes", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/persianfood/comments/b1lj6b/are_barberries_sold_in_persian_grocery_stores/", "html_title": ""}

Place a pot on high heat and pour in water slightly less than the height of the pot. Allow the water to boil.\n2. Once the water boils, drain the rice and add it to the pot. Cook the rice for 3-7 minutes.\n3. Pour a little oil into the pot.\n4. Add the drained rice in a pyramid shape.\n5. Pour half of the brewed saffron and a little oil onto the rice. Allow it to simmer for 45-60 minutes. Place the pot on low heat.\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Cook the chicken\n\n1. It's time to cook the chicken. Take a pan and pour oil into it. Add chopped onions and saut\u00e9 them.\n2. Clean the chicken and cut the chicken breast into pieces. Add them to the pan.\n3. Sprinkle salt, pepper, turmeric, and cinnamon onto the chicken.\u00a0\n4. Add water.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Brew saffron and Saute the raisins\n\n1. While the chicken is cooking, let's prepare the raisins. To do this, brew saffron in hot water for 5 minutes.\n2. Drain the raisins. Add butter (or oil) to another pan. Allow butter to melt, then add the raisins to the pan and saute them a little. Add half of the brewed saffron.\n\n### Finish - Keshmesh Polo is ready!\n\nTo serve the dish, take a plate and transfer the rice onto it. Place the raisins and chicken on top of the rice.

{"title": "URGENT help needed!! I had an anaphylactic reaction to something in a dish and don\u2019t know how it was made.", "selftext": "TL; DR at the bottom\n\nI am a care manager and have a client who came to the US a little over two years ago from Afghanistan. She made an absolutely heavenly smelling chicken dish for her therapist and myself (we work together). The therapist is vegan so I brought the whole dish home last night to share with my family. She prepared it in a foil pan so it could be heated up right in the oven. My wife and I pulled back the foil before warming it up and just smelled the chicken. It was on a bed of pilaf or rice (long grain, not white but beige and had mixture of darker grains), onion had been sliced around the edges and cooked along with the chicken. The meat itself was still on the bones, though cut in a different place to have the breasts more visible for cooking. My client said that she cooked it for 1.5 hours yesterday. It appeared to have been cooked together, and the grain bed could have absorbed any broth or liquid. I took another whiff and set it aside while the oven warmed. \n\nWithin 5 minutes of this, my eyes got bright red and itchy. When my face started itching I took an antihistamine. By 15 minutes, my face was swollen and I was having an allergic reaction. I\u2019ve had it happen twice before: once when I was exposed to horses in a gym class field trip, and another when I had a PPD skin test. The former was much more severe, and this was like that. I\u2019m still getting this out of my system and my body is continuing to react. Sadly, the chicken was the only thing different in my day yesterday. \n\nWhat spices are used in Persian cooking that are not very common in the US? My client has always told me she is Persian so I believe her cooking would be as well. There is just no way I can tell her what happened without causing her to feel bad. She has been struggling for a while, and this was a gift from her heart. My concern is that now I know there is something that causes this reaction but I\u2019m not aware of what it is. Any help is extremely appreciated. \n\nTL; DR: A client from Afghanistan made a chicken dish for me that caused an anaphylactic response.

However there are sound that are quite delicious.

As a result, the flavor of saffron always stands out front and center. There is never a flavor of saffron at any Persian restaurant.

Boil the water to cover the thighs, season with SALT/PEPPER/PAPRIKA/GARLIC powders (poultry seasoning if you have it!!!) Now just put the lid on and let it simmer for an hour or two.  Oh yeah adding an onion cut into a few pieces is good too. \n\n2 use your strainer and catch the liquid, that\u2019s the liquid for the rice in the rice maker. Keep the oil from the chicken. \n\n3. Let the liquid sit in your measuring cup, add rice to Persian rice maker, (depending on how much oil/rice half a stick to a stick or so). You can put your  Basmati, half - 1 cup of dry lentils, the cooking stock, butter, and the chicken thighs that you shredded w/out the bones. Make some saffron water if you want.\n\n4 always turn the rice maker for 2 or 3 of the 45min cycles depending on how much rice/tahdig. the oil and butter combo from the chicken thighs makes the tahdig soooo delicious and tastes like fried chicken.\n\nPlz let me know if you like or any modifications!!!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/persianfood/comments/1igbs6g/easy_home_americanized_persian_food/", "created_utc": 1738541187.0, "score": 12, "author": "Moocows4", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/persianfood/comments/1igbs6g/easy_home_americanized_persian_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Koobideh in a basket Pros and Cons:", "selftext": "I typically utilize my wide skewers for my koobideh but I decided to try one of these cages that I found at my local market to help quicken the prep time.\nThere were a few pros and cons.\nPro: \n1. Faster prep in terms of meat placement inside cage.\n2. No need for grill grates so I removed them (they are rusted up and nasty anyways. Even though I just replaced them last year.\n3. As a result of removing the grates, more heat from the flame so thats good. Cooks fast.\n4. No need to really micromanage like you have to do with skewers. The meat will not fall out. \n5. It cooked evenly and the kebabs tasted perfect just like with a skewer. I made sure the meat was consistent in thickness during insertion in basket.\n6. The meat was easily removed from the basket after cooking.\n\nCons:\n1. I think this device was made in China unfortunately. After I finished cooking, two of the baskets cross bars detached from the frame. Not sure how I\u2019ll fix it. Thats very annoying and the result of a cheap junk made in china.\n2. It was pretty heavy fully loaded but I have good grip strength so it wasn\u2019t an issue for me to flip it but I can see it being an issue for someone with weaker grip and forearm strength.\n3. It was a bit messier when flipping because the juices drip while flipping too so you have to try to keep it over the open grill.\n4. The wood handle has a red colored dye that was leeching into the palm of my hand. I have no clue why this wood handle is dyed in such a cheap and poor manner.\n5. As stated above, flipping is a a bit tricky but it was not impossible.\n6. Cleaning took slightly longer then my skewers. I only used dawn dish soap water and green scotch bright pad to clean and hang dry.\n\nOverall, the experience of using this basket was good and I would like to continue cooking my kebabs in this manner because I believe that overall, it was faster to set up. If anyone would halpen to know where to source higher quality cages that are not chinese in origin I would love to know where to purchase them from. I am not opposed to single kebab length baskets either.

But I was reading that it was dried. But I've seen it in jars on videos but also in a ball. Why is it a ball? Is it wetter if in a jar?\n\nFor a home cook who plans to use it but doesn't need a huge amount, what brands could I default to if online or in a store? Should I get the jar or the balls? Are they even in balls in New York? \n\nI'm 45m from NYC/Queens so traveling is nbd. So a Persian mart would be a fun daytrip.\n\nIs kashk quintessential to Persian cooking? I've only really seen it in kashkebademjan...buuuuut that may be because I don't know of other foods that may have it. Can you eat kashk plain or on pita/lavosh/bread/toast/crackers? Or is that grossly frowned upon?\n\nCan you recommend a substitute? Both a dairy or non-dairy one?\n\nOr maybe I should forgo it?\n\nAlso, what's the difference between Kashk and what i think is called labne?

{"title": "URGENT help needed!! I had an anaphylactic reaction to something in a dish and don\u2019t know how it was made.", "selftext": "TL; DR at the bottom\n\nI am a care manager and have a client who came to the US a little over two years ago from Afghanistan. She made an absolutely heavenly smelling chicken dish for her therapist and myself (we work together). The therapist is vegan so I brought the whole dish home last night to share with my family. She prepared it in a foil pan so it could be heated up right in the oven. My wife and I pulled back the foil before warming it up and just smelled the chicken. It was on a bed of pilaf or rice (long grain, not white but beige and had mixture of darker grains), onion had been sliced around the edges and cooked along with the chicken. The meat itself was still on the bones, though cut in a different place to have the breasts more visible for cooking. My client said that she cooked it for 1.5 hours yesterday. It appeared to have been cooked together, and the grain bed could have absorbed any broth or liquid. I took another whiff and set it aside while the oven warmed. \n\nWithin 5 minutes of this, my eyes got bright red and itchy. When my face started itching I took an antihistamine. By 15 minutes, my face was swollen and I was having an allergic reaction. I\u2019ve had it happen twice before: once when I was exposed to horses in a gym class field trip, and another when I had a PPD skin test. The former was much more severe, and this was like that. I\u2019m still getting this out of my system and my body is continuing to react. Sadly, the chicken was the only thing different in my day yesterday. \n\nWhat spices are used in Persian cooking that are not very common in the US? My client has always told me she is Persian so I believe her cooking would be as well. There is just no way I can tell her what happened without causing her to feel bad. She has been struggling for a while, and this was a gift from her heart. My concern is that now I know there is something that causes this reaction but I\u2019m not aware of what it is. Any help is extremely appreciated. \n\nTL; DR: A client from Afghanistan made a chicken dish for me that caused an anaphylactic response.

I have gotten pretty good at making everything I like such as beef barg, zereksk polo, borani, fesenjon, etc.\n\nThe one recipe I cannot figure out is chicken barg.  Every recipe I have tried and every variation I've been able to come up with is never like restaurants in southern California. A lot of Persian restaurants here have terrible chicken barg. However there are sound that are quite delicious.  The flavor is pretty different than the flavor of all the recipes I find online.\n\nAll of the recipes I have tried all are based on the use of saffron. As a result, the flavor of saffron always stands out front and center. There is never a flavor of saffron at any Persian restaurant. I imagine it's simply because of the cost, they just never actually use saffron.\n\nSo the question is what is the recipe of Persian restaurants that have very good chicken barg yet are obviously not using saffron?\n\nEven if it is not authentic I would still like to learn how to make it.

{"title": "Are barberries sold in persian grocery stores real barberries?", "selftext": "I am very fond of the taste and colour when I cook basmati rice. I think they taste better than raisins in a pilaf. As I live in a  suburban Canadian community of many Persians, there are several grocrey stores that sell them. Previously I have bought these bulk and was happy with their taste. But the same Persian shop in Coquitlam (Urban Gate) no longer sells them by the scoop.\n\nToday when shopping there I noticed that they had two different brands. Both I believe were 237 grams. All prices are in Canadian dollars...\n\n\\-  cheap, repackaged in Canada (Ontario if I recall correctly).  I didn't buy them because they were smaller, had very much darker and lighter ones both, but the berries looked to be of inferior quality (not something I would use for a special ocassion). I did not note country of origin. It even looked as if they had been coated with an oil (as most commercial cranberries get done with, with sugar!). I have not taste-tested these. $4.75 or so\n\n\\-  expensive, from Iran. Both lighter and darker ones (about 50% of each, but no really dark ones), more even shape than the cheaper ones. Tart with flavour that sped to my neck glands with glee. Cranberry-like aroma. Company is Saharkhiz Saffron in Mashbad. $7.99\n\nAccording to my preliminary reading, the botanical (Latin) name of real barberry is Barbarum vulgaris. However, one of the less desirable tasting goji berries (wolfberries) popular in Chinese cooking is Lycium barbarum, which makes me wonder whether these are them.\n\nSo, is it just a matter of good quality (e.g. fresher) versus not so good quality or are the cheaper 'barberries' in fact not barberries at all - in the same way that Cinamomum cassia is not Cinnamomum verum (real cinnamon from Sri Lanka)?\n\nMaybe I can save some money by buying the cheaper ones, and they will prove just as tasty. Maybe they are even more nutritious. But I was turned off by the shrivelled appearance compared to the Iranian ones -- which for all I know are \\*also\\* not true barberries!\n\nWhat say you?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/persianfood/comments/b1lj6b/are_barberries_sold_in_persian_grocery_stores/", "created_utc": 1552691222.0, "score": 12, "author": "HermesHermes", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/persianfood/comments/b1lj6b/are_barberries_sold_in_persian_grocery_stores/", "html_title": ""}

Faster prep in terms of meat placement inside cage.\n2. No need for grill grates so I removed them (they are rusted up and nasty anyways. Even though I just replaced them last year.\n3. As a result of removing the grates, more heat from the flame so thats good. Cooks fast.\n4. No need to really micromanage like you have to do with skewers. The meat will not fall out. \n5. It cooked evenly and the kebabs tasted perfect just like with a skewer. I made sure the meat was consistent in thickness during insertion in basket.\n6. The meat was easily removed from the basket after cooking.\n\nCons:\n1. I think this device was made in China unfortunately. After I finished cooking, two of the baskets cross bars detached from the frame. Not sure how I\u2019ll fix it. Thats very annoying and the result of a cheap junk made in china.\n2. It was pretty heavy fully loaded but I have good grip strength so it wasn\u2019t an issue for me to flip it but I can see it being an issue for someone with weaker grip and forearm strength.\n3. It was a bit messier when flipping because the juices drip while flipping too so you have to try to keep it over the open grill.\n4. The wood handle has a red colored dye that was leeching into the palm of my hand. I have no clue why this wood handle is dyed in such a cheap and poor manner.\n5. As stated above, flipping is a a bit tricky but it was not impossible.\n6. Cleaning took slightly longer then my skewers. I only used dawn dish soap water and green scotch bright pad to clean and hang dry.\n\nOverall, the experience of using this basket was good and I would like to continue cooking my kebabs in this manner because I believe that overall, it was faster to set up. If anyone would halpen to know where to source higher quality cages that are not chinese in origin I would love to know where to purchase them from.

{"title": "A Question About Kashk", "selftext": "Hello my friends,\n\nI am slowly working my way through Persian cooking to connect with my roots and also heal my heart since my Persian dad's passing. He was my only connection to Persian culture and I'm kind of lost with what is Kashk.\n\nI just have a lot of questions and was wondering if you can help me out with understanding it.\n\nI was reading up on it, and there's apparently Iranian Kashk which is...I believe usually dairy? But I was reading that it was dried. But I've seen it in jars on videos but also in a ball. Why is it a ball? Is it wetter if in a jar?\n\nFor a home cook who plans to use it but doesn't need a huge amount, what brands could I default to if online or in a store? Should I get the jar or the balls? Are they even in balls in New York? \n\nI'm 45m from NYC/Queens so traveling is nbd. So a Persian mart would be a fun daytrip.\n\nIs kashk quintessential to Persian cooking? I've only really seen it in kashkebademjan...buuuuut that may be because I don't know of other foods that may have it. Can you eat kashk plain or on pita/lavosh/bread/toast/crackers? Or is that grossly frowned upon?\n\nCan you recommend a substitute? Both a dairy or non-dairy one?\n\nOr maybe I should forgo it?\n\nAlso, what's the difference between Kashk and what i think is called labne? It tasted  like a yogurt with shallots in it....and is that different from kefir cheese?\n\nI'm grateful for your help in advance!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/persianfood/comments/12ap5dh/a_question_about_kashk/", "created_utc": 1680538422.0, "score": 15, "author": "Kreos642", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/persianfood/comments/12ap5dh/a_question_about_kashk/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
