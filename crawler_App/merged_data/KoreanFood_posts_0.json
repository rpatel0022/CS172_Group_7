{"title": "How we make kimchi at our off grid homestead \u270c\u263a\ufe0f", "selftext": "Hey Folx! My girfriend Grace and I live on a small off grid homeatead and we try to be self suffcient as possible. Korean food is wonderful for long term, no refridgeration storage and is a staple for us. I wanted to shate with y'all our recipe for making simple, easy homemade kimchi.\n\nGrace's  \uae40\uc7a5 (kimjang - kimchi making) recipe!\n\nNote: kimchi is the Korean word for pickle. While Napa cabbage kimchi is the iconic Korean kimchi, we encourage you to explore kimchis made from radishes, cucumbers, etc.\n\n Brine cabbage for 10 hours, focusing on softening the base of the cabbage. I like to do this overnight. In this recipe, we used 6 heads of Napa cabbage.\nTake off dirty leaves.\nCut a few inches into cabbage base, then split in half with hands.\nCut a few inches into the halves, crack the base of the cabbage open, but don\u2019t split them. On smaller cabbages, skip this step.\nSprinkle quality \ucc9c\uc789\uc5fc (natural coarse sea salt) salt into the base of the cabbage. If you need a faster brine, use more salt, but expect to rinse the cabbage leaves more later on.\nArrange cabbages in a large bowl, so that the base of cabbage is slightly pointed downwards, allowing moisture and salt to collect at the base of the cabbage.\nBrine for 7-10 hours but ideally 10.\nCheck that the cabbages have all been evenly softened. They should have halved in volume and the leaves should be pliable, all the way down to the base. If some cabbages were sitting atop others, they may be less softened. Rotate these to the bottom and allow them to brine a bit more.\nRinse cabbages with water, removing excess salt. This step prevents overfermentation, so please don't skip it. After each rinse, taste a cabbage leaf. It should be salty, but not overbearingly so. If it's too salty to chew and eat, keep rinsing. Save the brine water for other pickles!\nPrepare other vegetables\nScrub potatoes and remove bruised parts. Cut into halves or thirds and let sit in water. Boil until half of potatoes are completely boiled. Then, we're done with the potatoes remove them and reuse them for something else. In this recipe, we used 5 medium potatoes and about 2 quarts of water.\nPeel and slice onions. In this recipe, we used 3 medium onions.\nJulienne daikon radishes. In this recipe, we used 1.5 daikon radishes.\nSlice green onions and chives. In this recipe, we used 15 green onions.\nIf you're making additional kimchi, slice those vegetables as well. We used 3 daikon radishes and chopped them into large pieces to slow the rate of fermentation. If we wanted them to ferment faster, we would've cut them into small cubes. You will want to salt these vegetables, since they weren't brined.\nBlend (or finely mince) vegetables for sauce\nThis is the step where you get to be creative and express yourself, or work with what you have on hand.\nIf you have fresh red Korean chili peppers, red bell peppers, these are great for adding fresh flavor and heat. In this recipe, we minced 5 Serrano peppers.\nAdd 2-3 heads of garlic. In this recipe, we minced 2 heads of garlic.\nAdd a few tablespoons of fermented shrimp paste, if you have it.\nAdd a few tablespoons of fish sauce or oyster sauce to taste.\nCombine with potato water and blend.\nAdd 1-2 cups of coarse \uace0\ucda7\uac00\ub8e8, Korean dried chili flakes.\nAdd paste to cabbage and pack cabbages into fermentation container.\nAdd sauce in between each cabbage leaf, taking about 1-2 tablespoons of the sauce in your hand, smearing it from the top of the leaf, and depositing it in the base of the leaf. You don't need to overly sauce the leafy green part, since it will get plenty of time to marinate. Like the brining step, we're giving more attention to the cabbage base.\nFold the cabbage in half and neatly pack into fermentation container.\nRemove air from fermentation container.\nStore in a cool, dark location. Minimize opening and closing this container to reduce the likelihood of contamination.\n \n\nNote: If kimchi overferments it is still safe to eat. Cooking the kimchi can get rid of the overly sour flavor. you can stir-fry it for kimchi fried rice, put it in a kimchi stew, or fry it up in a kimchi pancake! We love Maangchi's recipes, because they are optimized for a Korean American audience who may not have access to traditional Korean ingredients.

{"title": "Every Korean mom has made this for their child at one point", "selftext": "I remember when my parents first made this for me. My family was pretty poor when I was growing up so my parents would always try to repurpose something we already had into something else or something functional. My dad would insist on building everything, whether it was chairs or tables\u2014at one point he even made a dog house when my sister and I insisted that we needed a dog. Whenever anything broke, he would always find a way to fix it or repurpose that thing into something else. \n\n\nKimbap was no exception. We would egg fry old kimbap and make this dish as a treat whenever it had been sitting in the fridge for too long. My mom would make this weekly so that we could eat kimbap we took from church on Sundays and eat it all week without feeling like we were eating the same meal. Not going to lie, sometimes I got sick because we let the kimbap sit in our fridge too long. But I loved it and it made up a big part of what I ate as a kid.\n\n\nNowadays, sometimes I go and get the 1+1 kimbap from H Mart at the end of the night so I can make this at home. It\u2019s weird how something that represented poverty in my childhood is something I look back to in nostalgia\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/nv2acgrp7dwd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1729627899.0, "score": 2414, "author": "cottonshoes", "num_comments": 82, "permalink": "/r/KoreanFood/comments/1g9rszk/every_korean_mom_has_made_this_for_their_child_at/", "html_title": ""}

If it wasn't a chicken nugget or a ravioli he wouldn't touch it. I've scoured the internet for recipes to actually get him to eat. The majority of them were so absolutely delicious but my youngest kiddo would happily turn his nose up at it. He is heavily autistic and it's just a battle. \n\nWell, I found the trick.. I made a Korean dish and he actually sat down and finished his entire plate and then asked for more. Asked if I could make it again soon. I happily agreed! Well 1 week turned into 3 of steadily eating only Korean food, and a month straight of making only Korean food has left me at a loss for recipes. So throw some of your best recipes at me! He has challenged me to make a new Korean dish every day for a year. I'm happy he's actually eating, and eating healthy, and actually asking me to include different veggies. He's 15, verbal, but extremely picky. This will be made for a family of 6. Him and I are the only ones in the house that will eat Kimchi so I make him a rice bowl with kimchi and an egg almost every morning for breakfast. I've been sending him rice with Korean cucumber salad and raw fresh veggies and spicy chicken for lunch to school or ramen that I made.

The man who runs the shop I bought them from said, \"The Chinese cabbages are \u00a31.99 each, so make sure you choose the biggest ones \ud83e\udd23!\" So I chose two big ones, but ended up with a little too much \ud83e\udee3.

They are for kimchi, sauerkraut and pickling etc. You can use them for brining, fermenting and storage. \n\nI bought a 1.7L one and a 3.4L one. The one in the pic is the 3.4L one. The size is deceiving, I didn't think that all the kimchi I made would fit in that one alone. I thought I'd have to use both. It fit in it with room to spare, so that's fab! \ud83d\ude00 \n\nI dont usually like plastic, but they come recommended. My main reasons for buying the containers was that they are meant to help with containing the smell more \ud83d\ude32. I also bought them as they have the inner lid that acts in place of fermentation weights. You press it down on the contents.

{"title": "First time trying Jajangmyeon from a local korean restaurant", "selftext": "As an avid fan of Korean cinema, I've seen a lot of movies featuring Jajangmyeon as a comfort food that looks incredibly delicious, which made me super curious. A few years ago, I really wanted to try it, but I couldn\u2019t find any restaurant that served it like in the movies, so I settled for an instant version from a store.\n\nI was excited to taste it, but it was so disappointing\u2014it honestly tasted like earth or soil? I don\u2019t know, lol. I thought the sauce was terrible, but I told myself that maybe this was just the natural taste profile of black bean, or maybe I made it wrong, or maybe the brand was just bad (I forgot what it was). After that, I stopped looking for it.\n\nBut over the years, I kept seeing it in shows and clips, with people suggesting that the real thing is much better than the instant version. Luckily, today I passed by a newly opened local Korean restaurant. I was originally craving Tteokbokki since it\u2019s more common where I live, but then I saw that they also served Jajangmyeon.\n\nI decided to give it another chance\u2014and damn, it was *so* different. Deliciously different. I know it doesn\u2019t look that great in the picture, but I ate everything. Yes, I *get* it now. It had bits of meat\u2014not sure if that\u2019s common, but I think it would taste even better with more. Either way, the noodles alone were satisfying enough.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be ordering again! :)\n\nI'm just sharing this here because I don\u2019t have anyone to share this TMI with.

{"title": "My wife made Korean Fried Chicken with a special crumb", "selftext": "Hey Everyone, me and wife made a video about a Korean Fried Chicken recipe from our friends, I would love to know what you think about it.  \n\nMy Korean Fried Chicken Recipe\n\nIngredients   \n\\- 2kg Chicken Legs (mixture of wings and drumsticks)  \n\\- 1 Cup of Cornstarch   \n\\- 1/2 Cup of Plain Flour   \n\\- 1/2 tsp of Paprika   \n\\- Salt   \n\\- Pepper   \n\\- 5 Eggs   \n\\- 2 x 180 bags of Doritos (Cool or Flamin Hot)   \n\\- 100g Panko   \n  \nSauce  \n\\- Half a large onion   \n\\- 1 x Heaped tbsp of Gochujang  \n\\- 3 x tbsp of Honey   \n\\- Spash of Water (optional)   \n  \nMarinade (if you can leave it overnight or at least 30mins)  \n\\- 500ml Buttermilk  \n\\- 1tbsp Paprika   \n\\- 1 pinch of Salt   \n\\- 1 shake of Pepper   \n  \nMethod   \nMarinate the chicken in the marinade for at least 30 mins but overnight if you can.   \n  \nPut together the flour, cornstarch, Paprika, salt and pepper for the dry mix.  \nCrack all eggs into a dish, and that will be your wash.   \nPut together crushed Doritos and panko to create your crumb   \n  \nPlace the marinated chicken into the dry rub, covering it all, then into the egg wash, and finally into the crumb. Repeat until you have covered all the chicken.   \n  \nPut rapeseed oil in a pan and heat it up, put enough so that when the chicken lies flat it is not completely covered and half of it is out of the oil. It is very important to shallow fry and not deep fry!! As all the crumb will just burn off, trust me, we have tried.   \n  \nWe found that drumsticks took 8-10 mins, thighs almost 12 mins, and wings just under 5 mins, obviously, if you have smaller bits of chicken, it will take less and bigger ones will take longer. We then go to the air fryer to double cook them and get the chicken extra crispy! Again depending on the size of the chicken put them on airfry 200' for 3 - 5 mins.   \n  \nFor the sauce you just put the onions on a low heat and sweat them down. Then once translucent, add in all the other ingredients, once all combined taste and add in more honey for a sweeter flavour or more Gochujang for spicier flavour.   \n  \nDrizzle the sauce over the chicken or have on the side to dip, and enjoy!\n\nIf you have extra mix left over, make some cheesballs! Grab a block of whatever hard cheese you want, cut it up into large balls, mix the crumb and egg wash together and mould it around the cheese, then a couple of minutes frying and again a couple of minutes in the air fryer.

{"title": "Homemade Creamy Rabokki (\ub77c\ubcf6\uc774) - My Favorite Comfort Food!", "selftext": "The video for this is on my channel\u2764\ufe0f link in bio if you wanna show some love! I wanted to share my go-to creamy rabokki recipe that combines the best of tteokbokki and ramyeon with a deliciously creamy twist. This has been my comfort food lately and thought you all might enjoy it too!\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the Tteok (rice cakes):\n- 1 cup glutinous rice flour  \n- 1/2 cup hot water  \n- 2 pinches of salt  \n- Neutral oil (for greasing hands/surface)\n\nFor the main dish:\n- 1 pack Indomie instant ramen (Mi Goreng or Chicken Curry recommended)  \n- 3 sausages (about 150-180g), sliced  \n- 1 boiled egg, peeled  \n- 1 tbsp unsalted butter (or neutral oil)  \n- 1 tsp minced garlic  \n- 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)  \n- 1 cup milk (whole milk or unsweetened oat/soy milk)  \n- 1/4 cup water  \n- 1 tsp soy sauce  \n- 1 tsp sugar  \n- 1 Indomie seasoning packet (use only one\u2014either the soy sauce or the seasoning powder, depending on which flavor you're using)  \n- Optional: 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella or cheddar cheese  \n- Optional: green onions and sesame seeds for topping\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Make the Tteok (Rice Cakes)\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine:  \n   - 1 cup glutinous rice flour  \n   - 2 pinches of salt  \n   - Gradually pour in 1/2 cup hot water, stirring as you go.  \n2. Mix into a soft dough.\n3. Lightly oil your hands and roll the dough into small logs, about finger-thick and 2-3 inches long.  \n4. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the shaped tteok.\n5. Cook until they float to the top.\n6. Once floating, remove them and immediately place in a bowl of cold water.\n7. After a brief soak, drain and transfer to an empty bowl. Set aside.\n\n2. Cook the Sausages\n- Heat a pan over medium heat and saut\u00e9 the 3 sliced sausages for about 3-4 minutes until browned and cooked through. Remove and set aside.\n\n3. Prepare the Creamy Sauce\nIn the same pan:\n1. Add 1 tbsp butter and let it melt.  \n2. Stir in 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 tbsp gochujang, saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds until fragrant.  \n3. Pour in:\n   - 1 cup milk  \n   - 1/4 cup water  \n   - 1 tsp soy sauce  \n   - 1 tsp sugar  \n   - The Indomie seasoning packet (either the soy sauce or seasoning powder\u2014don't use both to avoid overpowering saltiness).  \n4. Mix until everything is dissolved into a smooth sauce. Bring it to a gentle simmer.\n\n4. Assemble the Dish\n1. Add the prepared tteok and let them simmer in the sauce for 3-5 minutes until soft and chewy.  \n2. Add back the cooked sausage and toss to coat.  \n3. Add the cooked Indomie noodles into the sauce and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until sauce thickens.  \n4. If using, stir in 1/4 cup shredded cheese and let it melt into the sauce for a richer, creamier texture.\n\n5. Finishing Touches\n- Add the boiled egg, halved or whole, and let it warm in the sauce for a minute.\n- Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds if you like.\n\nServe immediately\u2014super hot, super creamy, super good.\n\nRecipe Notes\n- For a spicier version, add an extra 1/2 tbsp of gochujang or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.\n- Feel free to add vegetables like sliced mushrooms, cabbage, or carrots for extra nutrition.\n- This dish is best enjoyed fresh, as the noodles will continue to absorb the sauce if left sitting.\n- For a baked version, transfer the mixture to an oven-safe dish, top with extra cheese, and bake at 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F for 5-7 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/c7hrujqjy5xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745666432.0, "score": 87, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/KoreanFood/comments/1k8anv1/homemade_creamy_rabokki_\ub77c\ubcf6\uc774_my_favorite_comfort/", "html_title": ""}

I've always loved charcoal yakinuki style bbq but can't stand the smoke it generates and collects in the roof. \nDon't need fancy charcoal filtration as the idea would be for a conduit to vent the smoke 3-4m away from the table to the outdoors. To minimise impact on the fan and vent pipe I'd probably fit a range hood style filter with the usual aluminium/ss mesh as Id imagine the smoke will have large amount of particulate matter like soot and oil. \n\nSo far I'm thinking \n1. a round base with perforations like that seen here: https://tr-equipment.com/products/saycook-db-2017g-smokeless-easy-to-clean-down-draft-roaster-korean-bbq\n\n\n2. Instead of the extraction and filter though, I'd try and fit a single standard range hood filter in the path just at the beginning of the vent \n\n3. Somehow fit something like a dynabreeze 4-5 m away from the table with the duct fitted to the bottom of the table. \n\n\nIn my mind the main issues so far\nA. Sourcing a bowl like the linked to begin with! Trying to find them separately is surprisingly difficult \nB. Getting the fits correct on the filter and duct\nC. (The easiest bit) Ftting it into a table design that won't be too ugly.\n\nNot an engineer, but eager to learn skills to achieve my yakiniku dreams at home :p\n\nOr, if it's already widely available in the domestic space outside of Australia where I'm from, please enlighten me!

The back of the pack gives you two sets of instructions \u2014 one for a single pack and one for cooking two at once. I went for the double pack and followed the two-serving instructions, which had me drain all the water before mixing in the sauce.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 it turned out *way* too dry. So, I did a little tweak and added some water like they suggest in the single-serving method, and that made all the difference. The sauce mixed in way better, and the noodles had that perfect texture \u2014 not too dry, not too soupy.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Spice Level:**\n\nThis hits right between regular **Shin Ramyun** and **Buldak**.

If you like your noodles spicy and on the drier side, this one\u2019s a must-try. Just a heads-up: if you\u2019re doing two packs, don\u2019t be afraid to add a bit of water after draining to get that perfect consistency.

{"title": "How is KBBQ different from American BBQ (or just regular BBQ)?

Mostly pork belly, hanwoo cuts (Korean wagyu), and also chicken (dakgalbi). \n\n2) Korean BBQ are mostly cooked indoors. Which is not very intuitive but Korea has very extreme seasons, so people consider eating BBQ outdoors more like a camping thing than a KBBQ dinner we associate with. Also, you probably noticed the big vents sucking in smokes to the ceiling to cook indoors, those systems are very well-developed due to this reason. \n\n3) Both KBBQ and American BBQ is better cooked on a coal fire :3\n\n4) Usually American BBQ is eaten by making a burger or hot dog with bread and cheese, KBBQ has vegetable side dishes like lettuce, spring onions, fresh pepper, and sesame leaves - all combined to make a lettuce wrap (ssam). \n\n5) Both KBBQ and American BBQ have someone dedicated to do the grilling for everyone lol. I think knowing how to grill well is an important life/social skill. Some KBBQ restaurants train the staffs to cook the meat to their standards for quality assurance.

I was also thinking of using a chuck roll as well. I don't know how that will come out, but it's a good price in my parts. Lastly I was thinking of getting a whole ribeye. \n\nI'm open to all thoughts and suggestions!\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreanFood/comments/1j5y3ys/starting_kbbq_at_home/", "created_utc": 1741376482.0, "score": 1, "author": "Physical-Fig-1301", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/KoreanFood/comments/1j5y3ys/starting_kbbq_at_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How do you estimate fermentation on storebought kimchi?", "selftext": "Hello everyone sorry in advance if this is a question posted before. I just haven't seen it on the sub before and couldn't find an answer using the search function.\n\nI love kimchi and frequently buy some. It's not super accessible where I live. But my favourite has become bibigo, specifically their refrigerated cabbage kimchi (most kimchi I come across is jarred/canned, which is nice for convenience, but isn't as flavourful imo). This time around I was able to find a big bag that's about 500grams. So I'm excited to try out some new recipes and experiment.\n\nSome recipes call for extra fermented kimchi (or the reverse). And as a novice to the kimchi world I was wondering if there was some way for me to gain insight on how fermented my kimchi is? I know aged kimchi has a stronger and more sour taste and smell. But I haven't purchased kimchi frequently enough to have a lot of insight in what is a mild vs strong scent/smell when it comes to kimchi.\n\nThe best before date on my package says late April but from what I can tell there is no advice on how quickly it should be consumed after opening.\n\nSo my question is pretty much:\n\n- Is my kimchi currently still fermenting further? Or has that process been stopped during their packaging process to stop spoilage or keep their product consistent? As I assume is the case for canned/tinned kimchi that is sold.\n- Is there a way to know how well fermented it currently would be considered as to guess which recipes it would be best used for?\n- If I wanted my kimchi very fermented, how long would that take? Should I be looking at the best before date to guide me? Or date of purchase? Date of opening?\n- If I wanted to have some well-fermented kimchi for cooking would I be able to open it already and have some with rice? Or would I have to leave it sealed to prevent spoilage? And just commit to having the whole bag well-fermented?\n\nAny advice you could give me would be much appreciated. I currently have just no idea whether I'd be better off opening it and going through it straight away. Or if I were better off giving it more time and letting the flavours develop, and if so how long? It's not super accessible here so I'd be really disappointed to have to throw it away in an attempt to 'experiment' with fermenting it further. I know people say that kimchi is fine to use as long as it isn't mouldy. But of course I have no notion of how old the kimchi I purchased may already be as this kimchi was not purchased in Korea or in store. So it could have been imported or stored months before it even made it's way to my fridge. Recourses I'm coming across all start from the assumption I'm starting off with a batch of fresh homemade kimchi, rather than storebought kimchi in a sealed bag.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreanFood/comments/1j2n81h/how_do_you_estimate_fermentation_on_storebought/", "created_utc": 1741020803.0, "score": 1, "author": "Le_Fancy_Me", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/KoreanFood/comments/1j2n81h/how_do_you_estimate_fermentation_on_storebought/", "html_title": ""}
