{"title": "I found research on NEGATIVE effects of pressure cooking on nutrition ...", "selftext": "\u2026and here\u2019s is why I\u2019m not going to write an article about it.\n\n\nI recently found a really promising research paper that tested THIRTEEN different frozen vegetables for nutrition after boiling, pressure cooking, steaming and microwaving. Whenever I find a research paper before bearing down and reading it I always look at the data tables. Initially, I was so excited to find this jackpot of nutritional data on comparing different cooking methods on so many vegetables. \n\n\nAs I went through one vegetable after another, pressure cooking was either worse than or slightly better than boiling and retained VERY LITTLE folates, carotenoids, and vitamin C compared to non-pressure steaming and microwaving. \n\n\nWhat?!?! \n\n\nI was confused because this data went against EVERYTHING else I\u2019d found so far \u2013 if true it would completely turn one of the values of pressure cooking on its head. But, it didn\u2019t take me long to find a BIG FLAW in the data. \n\n\nAt the beginning of a paper, the researchers detail what equipment they used and how they measured the data. And that\u2019s where something jumped out at me right away. For Boiling, Steaming and Microwaving the researchers instantly froze the cooked vegetable in liquid nitrogen for storage until they could measure the nutrient levels. BUT, the pressure cooked vegetables were thrown in an ice-water bath for 5 minutes first and THEN dipped in liquid nitrogen. \n\n\nHmm\u2026. so how could this small alteration affect the results?\n\n\nWell, I kept searching and found out that folates, carotenoids, and vitamin C are all WATER SOLUBLE. That means, they dissolve in water.\n\n\nSo, it is feasible that the pressure cooked vegetables lost additional nutrients in the ice water bath compared to all of the other cooking methods. So basically, the data on the pressure cooked vegetables is totally useless and cannot be compared to vegetables with other cooking methods that WERE NOT thrown in an ice bath for 5 minutes. \n\n\nI have contacted the lead researcher to ask if they also measured the nutrients in the ice water \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard back from them but I think it is unlikely since they did not state doing it in the paper. \n\n\nI\u2019m just putting this out there, in case anyone else stumbles on this research either thinking they found a GOTCHA and in the interest of full disclosure! If Dr. Bureau answers my query, I\u2019ll share her response in the Hip Pressure Cooking forums (where I originally posted this text). Ciao, L \n\n\nCitation: \n&nbsp;Bureau, S., Mouhoubi, S., Touloumet, L., Garcia, C., Moreau, F., B\u00e9douet, V., & Renard, C. M. (2015). Are folates, carotenoids and vitamin C affected by cooking?

It has one of the highest populations of Greek people (outside of Greece) IN THE WORLD \ud83d\ude2e \n\nThat's where I first had the delicious \"Greek lemon rice\", and it's so tasty I wanted to learn how to recreate it at home. \n\nAnd I can say this recipe was an incredible success! \n\nNot only is this a cool authentic recipe, that gets you some of the best chicken thighs from Instant Pot, but it's also a healthy, low-calorie meal that you can easily make 400-500 calorie portions out of with 30g+ protein \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\ud83e\udd70 If you decide to try my recipe, I hope you love it! Please lmk if you do because I'd love to hear from you \ud83e\udd70\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73WRITTEN DIRECTIONS\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n\nIngredients: \n\n- 1-2lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs; before I used 1.7lbs which made me 3 meals of 150-200g chicken.\n- 1-2 cups of **uncooked** basmati rice; before I used 2 cups of rice and had pretty much 1 cup of rice left over after portioning out the chicken. You could use 1.5 or 1 cup if you want less leftovers - but trust me you\u2019ll want extra rice after you taste this! \n- 3 lemons; could use 2\n- 2-3 cups of chicken stock; or broth of your choosing, you want a 1:1 ratio of rice to liquid, and then a little extra to account for and then a little extra to account for additional ingredients. \n- 1-2 Tablespoons fat; to brown the chicken, I used olive oil\n- Salt (to taste); for chicken\n- Pepper (to taste); for chicken \n- Garlic powder (to taste); for chicken \n- Something to marinate the chicken; ziplock bag, etc. \n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 1: Add chicken, juice from lemons, salt + pepper + garlic powder to bag. Marinate for at least 30m, or up to 24hrs. \n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 2: Sear chicken for 3m, flip and sear the other side for 3m. (SAVE MARINATING LIQUID BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT!) \n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 3: Briefly fry the **uncooked/raw** rice prior to cooking. (This is what makes it GREEK LEMON RICE.) Approx. 2m or until rice is opaque. \n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 4: Pour marinade liquid over rice, add chicken thighs on top, add cooking liquid. (Note: I used 6qt IP, you may need more or less liquid depending on size. Check video for tips.) \n\nMANUAL PRESSURE (high if you have option) = 4 MINUTES \n\nDONE! \n\nI hope you like it \ud83d\ude0b\n\nI \u2764\ufe0f this recipe because not only is it extremely **easy, no-prep, and comes together in under 10 minutes - it's a foolproof, no fail way to get JUICY, FALL APART, FLAVORFUL CHICKEN every time!** \n\n####[Here's a video with detailed directions if you want to check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKEG01ueV2I)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/mktxnl/ever_heard_of_greek_lemon_rice_def_a_must_try_the/", "created_utc": 1617654119.0, "score": 134, "author": "JJTheJetPlane5657", "num_comments": 46, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/mktxnl/ever_heard_of_greek_lemon_rice_def_a_must_try_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Day 3: Marinara Sauce", "selftext": "After a successful chicken soup, I figured it was time to adapt another personal staple--good 'ol marinara. \n\n1) Mise en place: I peeled and grated 1 large carrot, and 1 white onion onion (grating the onion is a tearful process, but overall I think it adds well to the consistency of the sauce), and diced 2 large cloves of garlic.\n\n2) I set my Instant Pot to normal saute, and put in 3 tbs of extra virgin olive oil.\n\n3) Once it's fragrant, I put a generous tablespoon of tomato paste--using a wooden spoon to coat it in olive oil and flatten it a bit for a greater browning surface area. The paste can be difficult to work with at times; it wants to clump up. To solve this I recommend rapidly tapping the edge of the wooden spoon against the bottom of the pan. I'm able to form a nice paste patty this way. \n\n4) Saute the paste, while carefully agitating to prevent it from burning. Over about 10 minutes, the paste will turn to a dark brick red color.\n\n5) Introduce the grated onion, the carrot, the garlic, and some more olive oil to keep the pan from drying out (\\~1 tbs). Incorporate the paste with the veggies, add salt, pepper, 3 bay leaves, basil (sometimes I add thyme, rosemary, or oregano too), then let it sweat for 2 - 5 minutes. \n\n6) Add a red wine (I prefer merlot). How much is up to preference I think. 1/3 - 1/2 a cup seems like the right amount to me. You need just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, but you don't want to overpower the sauce.\n\n7) Let the sauce simmer for about 7 minutes. Then add in a 32 oz can of whole tomatoes and 5 crushed garlic cloves.\n\n8) Put the cover on, and set the pot to pressure cook on low.\n\n9) Once it reaches pressure, let it cook for 10 minutes.\n\n10) After 10 minutes, release pressure and remove lid. Set the pot to normal saute, then mash the tomatoes and stir.\n\n11) Let the sauce reduce to desired thickness.\n\n12) Turn off pot, then add cooked al dente pasta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResults: This recipe has been a goto for a while, so a pressure cooker adaptation would bound to happen in my kitchen. Overall, I would say it's a good recreation. It cuts maybe 30 minutes of simmering out of the equation. 9/10", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/g3ug3s/day_3_marinara_sauce/", "created_utc": 1587241774.0, "score": 69, "author": "_theZincSaucier_", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/g3ug3s/day_3_marinara_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pressure Cooking tip: saute mode", "selftext": "I've seen countless pressure cooking recipe videos which seem to demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of using saute mode to brown food first, especially for diced meat, ground meat and onions.  \n\nBrowning can have two different meanings, depending on the recipe.  Most people seem to think it means cooking the meat until they don't see any pink.  Usually the meat actually turns grey, not brown, because the meat often releases a lot of moisture that prevents any actual browning until it all steams away, letting the saute temperature rise because only oil and grease remain.  Most of the videos I see show people adding liquid while the meat is still gray, not browned.\n\nBrowning can also mean cooking until it most of it turns from soggy and moist gray to a more crispy brown, to some degree.  This kind of browning add quite a bit of flavor and color due to the Maillard reaction of the amino acids and sugars with the higher heat.  No need to worry about those crispy bits remaining tough, since pressure cooking will end up tenderizing it anyways, but with much of that appealing browned color remaining.  If your pressure cooked ground meat always seems to look like gray dog food - it's probably because you didn't actually brown it: you grayed it.\n\nSame goes for onion.  If the onion remains white or translucent with no actual browning, then no extra flavor or color is being developed through the Maillard reaction.\n\nGarlic, on the other hand, can easily burn and become bitter if cooked too long at high temperature, especially garlic powder.  That's why it's better to add it after any meat or onions have browned so that you can lightly toast it and then add liquid to lower the temperature before it burns.  Extra care is necessary when toasting spices in oil to release their flavor without burning them.\n\nIf you don't want to actually brown any meat or onions because you don't care about the additional flavor and color, that's OK and I'm not judging your choice one way or another, but you can save yourself a whole lot of time in the saute mode by skipping most of it.   You can simply add some of the liquid in the recipe to the ground meat to easily break up any large chunks to mince it by stirring and proceed to add all the ingredients and liquids.  It's a lot faster to mince the meat with liquid, even if the meat is still pink and uncooked before bringing it up to pressure.   It will all get cooked the same in the end, just faster.\n\nIf you do brown the meat and onions, then it's usually normal for lots of browned goodness to stick to the bottom of stainless steel pots.  That's good, not bad.  It's a lot of free flavor.  You just need to add a small amount of liquid that will quickly boil and help you dissolve (deglaze) it with a little light scraping with a soft spatula of some kind that won't scratch the pot.   Deglazing the bottom is important to prevent those bits from burning or causing a burn warning on electric pressure cookers.  It also captures all that flavor and color into the cooking liquid.\n\nMuch of this subject is discussed in this [reddit thread](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kf9atd/cook_beef_until_brownedshould_i_actually_be/)  but not in the context of pressure cooking.\n\nI hope this is helpful and I welcome any comments you might have regarding browning in pressure cooker saute mode.  You might be able to cut the time of many recipes or improve the results of others when you know the difference between graying and browning.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/nq44hv/pressure_cooking_tip_saute_mode/", "created_utc": 1622580297.0, "score": 61, "author": "vapeducator", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/nq44hv/pressure_cooking_tip_saute_mode/", "html_title": ""}

I keep an Instant Pot in our kitchen at work, and it\u2019s been popular with the office. We have communal lunches/ pot lucks fairly regularly, and it\u2019s nice to be able to cook something fresh instead of just reheating. \n\nWe decided to do a department Thanksgiving lunch this week and when we were deciding who would bring what, someone said \u201cwhy don\u2019t you make a turkey breast in your Instant Pot?\u201d I was hesitant because I hadn\u2019t done it before, but I figured I couldn\u2019t mess up turkey that badly so I agreed. \n\nI just took a 5 pound fresh turkey breast, browned the skin on saut\u00e9 with some butter (skin went in the trash after cooking, this was just so I had something to deglaze), deglazed with chicken stock, dumped about 2 cups of stock into the pot and cooked on high for 30 minutes. Forgot to bring a knife to slice it and didn\u2019t feel like using one of the dull ones in the office, so I just kind of pulled the meat apart for serving.

{"title": "Simple and Fast Turkey Cajun Dirty Rice", "selftext": "With the recent increases in food prices, I thought I'd post some pressure cooker meal recipes that I think are affordable, simple, and fast to make.\n\nI frequently make my own version of Cajun Dirty rice, which I make no claim to be authentic, but is quite delicious and I think is something that's worth trying and making with your own preferences in mind.\n\nMy local Walmart has Festive-brand frozen ground turkey for $2.20 per pound, and turkey breakfast sausage for $2.10 per pound.  Either can be used for this recipe, although I prefer the seasoned sausage flavor.  You may use ground beef, ground pork, and/or ground sausage, as well as sliced smoked sausages or hotlinks of the spice level you like.  Ground meat of some kind is usually the basis of dirty rice, but lots of additions are OK to make your own hybrid.  Some recipes add chicken livers - I don't.\n\nWalmart has Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix - Family Size, 12 oz., for $2.08 per box.  The Zatarain's Jambalaya mix is similar, so you can use that instead if you wish.  Zatarain's products are widely available at many supermarket chains.   If you can't find the mix, use a 2 cups of parboiled/converted rice, 2 teaspoons Tony Chachere\u2019s Creole seasoning, and 2 teaspoons of Better than Bouillon roasted vegetable base (or other good bouillon), and 3 cups of water, to be added per the recipe instructions below after the sauteeing has been done.\n\nI would be quite derelict of my duty if I failed to stress the importance of the [Cajun Holy Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_\\(cooking\\)) of onions, bell peppers and celery for this recipe, which have the fundamental flavors of this cuisine, as well as Cajun dark roux of flour that's well toasted in oil and/or butter.  Unfortunately, I think the process of making a proper dark roux is out of scope for my mission of a simple & fast recipe, so please pardon me if I take some shortcuts in that regard in the interest of my goal here.  I have included a source of jarred dark roux for those who consider it required, although you're at liberty to make your own dark roux, of course.\n\nTwo parts of the Holy Trinity are easily obtained with the Walmart Great Value Pepper & Onion Blend, Frozen, 20 oz, $2.33, which contains sliced red and green bell peppers, with onion.  Kroger has something very similar:  Kroger Recipe Beginnings 3 Pepper & Onion Blend 12 oz for $1.39.  ALDI and many other stores have something similar: frozen bell peppers and onions, already cut and prepped.  Use whatever you find that's available.\n\nOnly the celery part of the Trinity is missing from that veggie mix.  So you can get some fresh celery, wash it and slice a couple of stalk of it if you wish.  Or you can use a little bit of celery salt or ground celery seed, less than half a teaspoon.  Or you can skip it.\n\nExtra rice can be used to stretch the meat and flavor into a larger batch.  Use rinsed long grain white rice or parboiled rice, preferably the latter.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pound of ground meat/protein, I use Festive Turkey Breakfast Sausage 16oz.\n\n* 1 20oz bag frozen peppers and onion mix,  2 12oz. bags, or whatever you want\n\n* 1 box Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix - Family Size, 12 oz.\n\n* approx. 2 tablespoons of oil.\n\n* optional 1/4 cup [Karys Dark Roux](https://www.amazon.com/Karys-Dark-Roux-16-Pack/dp/B08KQJPMYY/)\n\n* optional: extra dry rice, parboiled or long grain, plus 1.5 cups extra water per cup of dry rice.  Boost seasonings by at least 1 teaspoon per cup of liquid, so 1.5 teaspoons of Better than Bouillon Roasted Vegetable base and/or Tony Checheres Seasoning.\n\nInstructions:\n\nThaw any frozen meat, safely.   I transfer the frozen turkey sausage from freezer to fridge the night before cooking, if I remember.   I have a wiz bang newfangled inverter microwave oven that can thaw the turkey perfectly in 12 minutes, without cooking it.\n\nStart heating a 4qt. or larger stovetop pressure cooker over medium heat or start Saute mode on an electric pressure cooker.\n\nAdd 2 tablespoons of neutral cooking oil (your choice) to the pressure cooker, or spray with non-stick oil spray, or both.\n\nFry/saute the meat/protein until nicely browned in the oil, not merely gray color.  It's ok it it sticks to the pot, just don't let it smoke excessively or burn.  Brown is good.\n\nFor health reasons for those on a lower fat diet, you can remove/drain any excess oil/grease if you wish at this point or after frying the veggies in it.\n\nAdd the pepper/onion mix to the meat (whether the veggies are frozen or fresh, doesn't matter).  You may add sliced celery too.  Feel free to add other diced/sliced veggies, including diced carrot, more onion, minced/crushed garlic, chili peppers, etc.  You're eating it.  Use what you like.\n\nYou may saute or lightly brown the veggies, if you wish for more flavor.  You may add 1/4 cup of the dark roux (optional).\n\nAdd 1 12oz. box of Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix to the veggies & meat, stir briefly to absorb the oils and liquids with the rice mix.\n\nAdd 3.5 cups water.  (this is a little bit less than the box instructions because of the extra moisture in the veggies.)\n\nAt this point, you may add extra dry rice, water and seasonings per instructions above, to stretch the recipe.\n\nStir the liquid well with a long cooking spoon or spatula to dissolve any of the browned proteins that stuck to the bottom of the pot.  This will prevent burn warnings on electric pressure cookers.\n\nI suggest tasting the cooking liquid for seasoning balance at this point so that it can be adjusted to taste before pressure cooking the rice.\n\nBring up to pressure to cook for 6 minutes in a stovetop or electric pressure cooker.\n\nA natural pressure release is NOT necessary for rice, but you can do so if you wish.  I always quick release or do a cold-water release with my stovetop pressure cookers for this recipe.\n\nThis recipe normally takes me less than 15 minutes (except for thawing the meat) from start to finish and costs less than $7 total, not per serving.  It's a good balance of meat/protein, spices, flavorful veggies, and rice without being extra spicy hot.  You can make it that way too.  It can be doubled or tripled with no problem, so long as the total liquid+rice remains below the suggested max fill line on your pressure cooker.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/tpds9f/simple_and_fast_turkey_cajun_dirty_rice/", "created_utc": 1648360889.0, "score": 56, "author": "vapeducator", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/tpds9f/simple_and_fast_turkey_cajun_dirty_rice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Putting The Instant Pot Under Pressure: Testing Instant Pot vs. Fagor - The Basics: White Rice", "selftext": "**Preface**\n\nI have both an Instant Pot (Duo 8 quart) and a Fagor (Lux 8 quart), two of the most popular multicooker/electric pressure cookers on the market today, and I love them both. Most of the information below is applicable across most of the different model types.\n\nWhile using them both side by side I have discovered many similarities, but also more differences than meet the eye. After spending far more hours researching and reading about this stuff than I would care to admit, I've learned a few surprising things, and found that even though there is a wealth of information out there, some of it is certainly bad or confusing, and on certain topics, there is definitely a lack of information. I wanted to test some of the things I've been figuring out, and I thought I would post my results here.\n\nIt turns out a lot of those programmed function buttons on your IP don't work exactly as most people think, often in a surprisingly good way. Prepare to love your IP even more, and I have more tests coming!\n\n**White Rice**\n\nGoing with the basics, white rice seems like a good place to start. Both units have a function button for white rice - \"Rice\" for the IP and \"White Rice\" for the Fagor, however they do work slightly differently. **NOTE:** The \"Rice\" function button on the IP is only designed for (most) varieties of white rice, and is not suitable for brown or most other rice/grain varieties. I have found, however, that it works perfectly for quinoa!\n\n**Fagor** \\- This unit uses low pressure for white rice, and has a default time under pressure of 10 minutes. I live (mostly) at an elevation of 6,000 feet above sea level, and I do find that a number of things don't quite get cooked using standard recipes. Using the rule of thumb to add 5&#37; to the cooking time for each 1,000 of elevation above 2,000 feet seems to work quite well, so for this comparison I am going with 12 minutes (10 minutes plus 20&#37;) using the \"White Rice\" function button, and then a 10 minute natural pressure release, and fluffed with a fork at the end.\n\n**IP** \\- This is where it gets interesting. The IP \"Rice\" function button also uses low pressure, but it does not use a fixed time. The literature from the Instant Pot folks says: \"The cooking time is adjusted automatically depending on the amount of rice.\" This is true, but not really in the way implied by that sentence, as the IP has no way of measuring weight or volume. Specific to the \"Rice\" function only, the IP will determine when the rice is done by monitoring the temperature. When most of the liquid has been absorbed the IP will see a temperature spike, and thus it knows to switch itself to the \"Keep Warm\" mode and alert you that the pressure cooking time is done. I have found that it works out to a time under pressure that averages very closely to the times discussed above for the Fagor, and I also use a 10 minute natural pressure release, with the rice fluffed with a fork at the end.\n\n**The Recipe**\n\n\\-2 Cups Long Grain White Rice\n\n\\-2 Cups Water\n\n\\-2 TBSP Soy Sauce (low sodium, in this case, because that is what was in the fridge)\n\n\\-2 TBSP Extra Virgin Olive Oil (also good with an equal amount of butter, instead)\n\n\\-Rice rinsed under running water for 30-60 seconds, drained for 30-60 seconds (\\*this is a very important step\\*)\n\n**The Results**\n\nDelicious! Seriously, they both turned out wonderful rice. Fluffy, moist, just very slightly sticky, but the individual grains were slightly firm. In other words, about as close to perfect rice (to my preferences, at least) as I am likely to produce (and individual preferences could easily be accommodated by adding/subtracting small intervals to the natural pressure release time). There was virtually no difference between the two - if I could pinpoint any difference at all it would be that the Fagor rice seemed very slightly firmer, but not even enough to call it *al dente*, and it was so slight that it might be my imagination. If I am not imagining it I would guess that it might be because the IP runs a bit hotter than the Fagor.  Low pressure yields 5.8 \\~7.2 psi and 110\u00b0C \\~ 112\u00b0C (229 \\~ 233\u00b0F) for the IP, and 4 \\~7 psi and 108\u00b0C \\~ 110\u00b0C (226 \\~ 230\u00b0F) for the Fagor. Those numbers would be somewhat lower, factoring in elevation.  Also, the 5&#37; elevation rule mentioned above is just a rule of thumb, not an exact formula.\n\nIf I were blindfolded and being fed random forkfuls of both (which I will not do - not after The Great Blindfold Hot Wings Debacle of 2016), I don't think I could really tell when changing between the two.\n\n**And the winner is...** The Instant Pot! While I consider it a tie as far as taste/doneness/texture goes (they both did great), I would give the edge to the IP because the automation of the \"Rice\" function button. I am constantly pressure cooking stuff in different locations (and elevations), and not needing to worry about any calculations, even though a quite small issue, is a big plus to me. Also, should I happen to add more or less liquid (intentionally or otherwise) I think the rice would be more likely to turn out correctly with the IP.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/8vnk95/putting_the_instant_pot_under_pressure_testing/", "created_utc": 1530576143.0, "score": 56, "author": "kjl291", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/8vnk95/putting_the_instant_pot_under_pressure_testing/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I finally had success with Instantpot vegetarian red beans and rice, and I would like to share my method.", "selftext": "I love my instantpot, but i've had a lot of bad experiences with beans. Problems with flavor, consistency, undercooking, overcooking, etc. Well, last night I think I finally did something right with a big pot of red beans and rice. I would give a recipe, but it's more fun to discuss technique and go through the thought process that brought me to this success. \n\nAs a vegetarian I don't have many chances to enjoy that smokey, charred, grilled flavor that meaty dishes tend to have. So last night I decided to make cajun red beans. I know that the best way to flavor beans is to cook them with plenty of aromatics like the ones you would typically put in stock. However, in the past this approach left me less than satisfied with the tepid soupy flavor that results if you just throw in raw onion, carrot, celery and parsley with the beans. And sauteing the diced veggies beforehand killed a lot of the flavor in the finished product. I wanted something more savory and complex, with a smokey flavor that is so necessary in cajun food. \n\nI decided to give the veggies a quick char in my oven's broiler. Ideally I would have done this on a grill or gas stove to get that flame-fired taste, but this was the next best option. I very coarsely (only 2-3 pieces per veggie) cut up red onion, bell pepper, and celery (the holy trinity) along with some carrots and serrano peppers, and put them as close to the broiler as I could. I put no oil on the veggies to encourage them to char and burn instead of browning. They were in for a total of 6 minutes, with a quick flip at minute 4. I was very pleased with how the veggies turned out; blackened near the edges but still had some crunch.\n\nNow about the red beans. I soaked a pound of them for 8 hours. I know that some new-age food blogs encourage people not to soak their beans, but in my experience that advice doesn't apply to pressure cooked beans. Unsoaked beans seem to break apart and have very inconsistent texture no matter how long you cook them. Thus, I soaked and cooked them with the soaking liquid to preserve the color. It was 6 cups of liquid in total, which turned out to be a little too much, but next time I will cook in 5 cups and it should be perfect.\n\nI was conflicted about adding any tomato considering that acid can hinder the bean cooking process. I ended up caramelizing half a can of tomato paste in the instantpot with some canola oil before adding the beans/liquid. I didn't toast the beans like some have suggested, but I will try that next time to see if it makes a difference. \n\nOn top of the beans and liquid I generously threw in the charred veggies, several whole garlic cloves (raw), a bouquet of thyme and parsley, 2 bay leaves, half an orange, salt, pepper, and cajun salt seasoning. Additionally, a small pinch of baking soda was added to neutralize the acid from the tomato paste. I know there is a lot of debate about whether or not you should put salt with the cooking beans, but this time I took a chance and added salt.\n\nI cooked on high pressure for 15 minutes with a natural release, making the the total cooking times about 40 or so mins. When I finally opened the lid, the wonderful smell of thyme and filled my apartment. The beans seemed overcooked at first, but firmed up after cooling a bit. Although not bad in any way, next time I will probably cook them for a little less time (13-14 mins), or for the same amount of time with less water. Overall, they were consistently cooked with (somewhat) intact skins and a creamy texture. \n\nThe flavor was outstanding. The smokiness from the charred veggies mingled beautifully with the aromatics and the herbs, and could be tasted throughout the beans and the liquid. The tomato paste was a good, subtle addition to the texture and taste. I gave it a couple quick pulses from my stick blender to thicken it up and create a smooth, composed gravy. \n\nI removed the orange, the herbs, and the bay leaves but left the very soft veggies in. I then added generous dashes of hot sauce, fresh lemon juice, plenty more cajun salt, chopped parsley, sliced green onion, and a lot of butter. The result was tremendous served with basamati rice. I had it again for lunch today and it tasted even more smokey and savory. I would love to polish this recipe, next time with less cook time, less water, more salt, and a few more ingredients like cumin or smoked paprika. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/568g99/i_finally_had_success_with_instantpot_vegetarian/", "created_utc": 1475797055.0, "score": 49, "author": "None", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/568g99/i_finally_had_success_with_instantpot_vegetarian/", "html_title": ""}

It is shockingly easy and shockingly good. You'll thank me in the morning.\n\nServes 4-6\n\n1. Add olive oil to pot and set to saut\u00e9. When hot add in onion and pepper. Stir every thirty seconds or so until onion go from translucent to just starting to get a little color, about 5-7 minutes.\n2. Add in sausage, garlic, seasonings and wine (if adding). Stir every 30 seconds or so until the pink is gone from the sausage (but it doesn't necessarily have to be thoroughly cooked), about 5-7 minutes\n3. Add ziti pasta and water and stir.\n4. Top with sauce, close/seal lid and set for manual/high pressure for 5 minutes.\n5. When time is up, quick release pressure and open lid after pressure is done releasing.\n6. Ziti should be rather *al dente*. To complete the cooking set cooker to saut\u00e9. Stir every 20-30 seconds until ziti is fully cooked and sauce consistency is as desired, about 7-10 minutes. If the pot gets too hot and cooks too hard, to avoid scorching switch to \"less\" saut\u00e9 mode (or simmer, for a unit like a Fagor) after 3-4 minutes.\n7. Turn to warm mode (or off) and let cool for about 5 minutes.\n8. Serve, and sprinkle the fresh basil and grated cheese on top.\n\n**NOTES**\n\n1. The sauce you choose will have probably the most impact on the final product. You may go with simple tomato sauce, or a pasta sauce of your liking. The first time I did it was with a Muir Glen pasta sauce, and I don't think I've ever topped that. Experiment.\n2. The sausage will also be a big determinant - hot, sweet, whatever you like. I grind my own meat and make my own sausage, but I know that is impractical for many. Experiment.\n3. The \\*\\*Variable/Optional (see notes)\\*\\* tag is there because these ingredients will probably be represented at least in part in the sauce and sausage combination you select, so you will have to work it out - you might want more, less, or none. Experiment.\n4. Salt - there will be saltiness imparted by the sauce, sausage, and cheese. I'd recommend not adding any salt the first time you make it and see how it comes out.

{"title": "Second day - Chicken noodle soup", "selftext": "So I picked up [this recipe](https://www.realordinaryfood.com/instant-pot-chicken-noodle-crispy-skin/), and I wanted to try it out. But I also have my own tricks for chicken soup that I decided to incorporate.\n\n1. After I parted a chicken, I decided on using the breast meat and legs for the soup. Mise on place prep: 1/2 white onion, 1/2 sweet onion, 2 large carrots, and 4 small celery stalks.\n2. I set the cooker to saute, and browned the chicken parts in olive oil, allowing for room as to not overcrowd the pot. By the end, I had a nice fond going. Once browned, I removed and reserved the chix.\n3. I introduced the chopped veggies, bay, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, pepper, and some more olive oil to the pot and got a good sizzle going.\n4. Once the veggies had sweat 5 minutes, I added \\~1 cup of pinot grigio, scrapped the fond, and let it simmer for 5 more minutes.\n5. Finally, I nested the chicken at the bottom of the pot, added \\~4.5 quarts of home made chicken stock (that I had made from the carcass earlier in the day), closed the lid and set it to high pressure for 10 minutes.\n\n\\-----------Chicken skins.\n\n1. On the other side of the counter, around step 2, I brushed the detached chicken skins with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n2. I preheated the oven to 350 and let them cook for \\~ 20 minutes.\n3. After 20 minutes, I flipped them, they were still soft, but were firming up.\n4. After 15 more minutes I took them out, though they did still seem somewhat soft. I placed them on a paper towel, and within a few minutes of that they were crisp.\n\n\\------------Back to soup\n\n6) The pressure cooker finished, but I had stepped away for a little bit to run an errand.  When I had returned it was on the last minute of a 10 minute warm cycle, and it struck me that I was supposed to depressurize as soon as it finished.\n\n7) I depressurized the instant pot.\n\n8) After depressurizing, I removed the chicken and shredded it with two forks.\n\n9) I reintroduced the chicken , and set it to saute on low and introduced the noodles (about 2.5 cups of fusilli).\n\n10) I let them simmer for 9 minutes then set it to warm.\n\n\\------------Result\n\nFor my second full meal experience, this went better than my first. I was worried that I had ruined the meat again, but to my luck I didn't. It probably could have come more tender if I hadn't dropped the ball about depressurization. Overall though it was good 6/10. The broth turned out great. Silky smooth, but not watery. I had made chicken stock in the past, and it came out meh. The trick, I think, is to always scoop a good amount of fat off the top after it settles. The fat makes it too greasy and taste off. Certainly, leave some in there, but after making stock there is always too much. 8/10. The chicken skins: great crunch, but I added too much salt 5/10, but easily could have been 7/10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus tip: if you want some extra flavor, try adding a small splash of soy sauce to a bowl of soup. Often times I end up adding salt to taste anyway on my individual servings.

I expected good results but was surprised with how much more flavor these have over the store bought varieties. I feel like I am getting two recipes what with the pickled jalapenos that stay intact as whole slices and a jalapeno hot sauce with the remains of the slightly mushed up jalapenos left in the jar. After using up the slices, I've taken to giving the jar a good shake and then using it as a hot pepper sauce. Commercial pickled jalapenos have additives to hold color and texture which probably muck up the flavor a bit. These taste cleaner if that makes any sense. This is so easy and the flavor is so good that I am making these on a regular basis now. \n\nThe recipe is quite similar to candied jalapenos but minus the sugar. The candied jalapenos hold their shape as slices and have a little brighter color while the pickled jalapenos tend to break down a bit. Both are great to have on hand.\n\nAt a recent potluck, I provided candied jalapenos on cream cheese with crackers on the side. This simple offering was a hit. That inspired a friend to get an electric pressure cooker and she has now brought three of her friends into the electric cooker family. This week she made a batch of pickled jalapenos and a batch of candied jalapenos. Her work mates are very happy with the treats.

Soak for 15 minutes in cold water prior to cooking, then drain. I\u2019ve heard bad results with Jasmine rice from a few reviewers, but I think they made a different mistake with the layering - which we\u2019ll get to later in the recipe.  \n- 14.5oz (411g) Rotel; diced tomatoes with chilies \n- 1-2lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n- \u00bd jar (~200g) salsa of your choice\n- 1+ serving (85g) frozen corn\n- 1+ servings (85g) frozen spinach\n- 2+ tbsp cumin\n- Salt (to taste); for chicken\n- Pepper (to taste); for chicken \n- Garlic powder (to taste); for chicken \n- 2-3 cups of cooking liquid; water or stock/broth of your choosing, you want a 1:1 ratio of rice to liquid, and then a little extra to account for additional ingredients.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 1: Sear chicken for 3m, flip and sear the other side for 3m. (Season the tops with your salt, pepper, and garlic powder, set them aside when done searing. Deglaze pan.) \n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 2:  START LAYERING. Add in this order: pre-hydrated white rice (soaked for 15m), \u00bd of your seasonings, tin of Rotel (w/ water), other \u00bd of your seasonings, then the vegetables on top of the Rotel. (DON'T STIR.) \n\nAdd cooking liquid from ingredients list.\n\nFinally, put your chicken thighs back in and top with salsa divided evenly between them. \n\n*(Before we seal the deal, just eyeball your amount of liquid real quick to double check if it\u2019s good to go or if you think you need more. My ingredients recommendations are like sliders, I figure if you like less of something you\u2019ll put in more of others.

{"title": "P-E-R-F-E-C-T Pressure Cooker Red Wine Risotto: how to convert regular recipes to pressure cooker/IP", "selftext": "One of my favorite things to do is figure out how to make \"regular\" recipes in my Instant Pot! \n\nI thought that you guys would enjoy some background information on *how* to convert recipes to IP - in addition to the recipe for this red wine risotto. \n\nHere's the original recipe: https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/wild-mushroom-and-red-wine-risotto \n\nHere's a list of the changes I made: \n\n* ~~5 1/2~~ 2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade \n\n* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil \n\n* 1 small onion, finely chopped \n\n* Salt and freshly ground pepper \n\n* 1 1/2 cups arborio rice (10 ounces) \n\n* ~~1/2~~ 1 cup dry red wine \n\n * 2 tablespoons unsalted butter \n\n* 1 pound mixed wild mushrooms, thinly sliced \n\n* 1 shallot, minced \n\n* 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano \n\n* 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley \n\nWHY DID I MAKE THESE CHANGES? \n\nBecause the Instant Pot needs much less liquid than cooking something on the stove. Also I wanted more of a \"red wine flavor\" so I shaved a little extra off the stock to save room for that. \n\nThen I created the step-by-step directions by: \n\n1. Review directions of original recipe to identify key steps (what to saute first, boiling out the wine as part of the steps) \n\n2. Find other Instant Pot similar recipes that are WELL REVIEWED to cross reference pressure cooking time (I looked at 2 other risotto recipes to pick a pressure cook time) \n\nI hope you find this type of information helpful!! \n\nNow here's the full recipe as I cooked it: \n\n#\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73WRITTEN DIRECTIONS\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n\nIngredients: \n\n- 1 cup dry red wine, if you\u2019re like me sometimes you end up with leftover wine from the day before - this recipe is a perfect way to \u201cupcycle\u201d that \n- 2 cups of chicken stock, or liquid of your choosing\n- 1 1/2 cups arborio rice (10 ounces)\n- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or cooking fat of your choice \n- 1 shallot, minced\n- 3 hot Italian sausage links, or whatever sausage you want, I think the spicy aspect REALLY adds something to this dish\n- Thyme (to taste, season each layer of ingredients; recommend at least 2 Tablespoons) \n- Salt (to taste, season each layer of ingredients)\n- Pepper (to taste, season each layer of ingredients)\n- Garlic powder (to taste, season each layer of ingredients) \n\nAlso some optional ingredients: \n\n- 1lb mushrooms\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, I don\u2019t use this because my girlfriend is lactose intolerant. The original recipe calls for this, and if you want to use it then just stir that in at the end\n- 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, original recipe also calls for this but I\u2019m lazy - if you want to use it add at the end and top the dish or stir in\n\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 1: SAUTE. Add oil, sear sausage (if using) for 3m on both sides. When done, take out sausage and set aside. If using mushrooms, onions, etc. sear now + sear shallot until soft. Approx. 2m\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 2: Briefly fry the uncooked/raw rice before cooking. (Do not pre-hydrate rice.) 1-2 minutes until the rice turns opaque.\n\nThen add the wine into the pot and stir until it\u2019s evaporated.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 3: Now it\u2019s time to add the rest of your ingredients. \n\nI seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and thyme to taste as I added each layer. \n\nFIrst season the rice, then add your 2 cups of stock/liquid, and place the sausage on top. \n\nMANUAL PRESSURE (high if you have option) = 7 MINUTES \n\nDONE! \n\nI hope you like it \ud83d\ude0b\n\n##[Click here for video directions too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfYhaQ_qCo0)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/mz79k6/perfect_pressure_cooker_red_wine_risotto_how_to/", "created_utc": 1619469184.0, "score": 36, "author": "JJTheJetPlane5657", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/mz79k6/perfect_pressure_cooker_red_wine_risotto_how_to/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pressure Cooked Spicy Hot Texas Pinto Beans Recipe", "selftext": "This recipe was tested in an Instant Pot but my guess is that it will work in a regular pressure cooker.  You just dump in the ingredients, stir, and pressure cook.  It uses a one-pound package of pinto beans, a 15-oz can of tomatoes, dried onion flakes, and spices.  Cooking the beans for a long time results in a nice spicy sauce.  \n\nIf you are eating out of your pantry in between trips to the grocery store it's a good way to put a meal on the table without a lot of effort because all the ingredients are non-perishable ingredients.  I'll post the recipe text below and there's a printable recipe card at this link:\n\n[https://www.easygfcooking.com/blog/2020/3/22/instant-pot-spicy-hot-texas-pintos](https://www.easygfcooking.com/blog/2020/3/22/instant-pot-spicy-hot-texas-pintos)\n\n**Spicy Hot Texas Pintos**\n\nThis easy Spicy Hot Texas Pinto Bean recipe is gluten-free, vegan, and inexpensive.  When beans are paired with rice, they form a complete protein. For a protein-rich meatless meal sourced entirely from the non-perishable foods in your pantry serve these pinto beans with cooked white rice or brown rice.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n1 lb pinto beans, dried (about 2 1/4 cups by volume)\n\n3 1/2 cups water\n\n1 15-oz can tomatoes, crushed or diced\n\n3 TBSP vegetable oil\n\n3 TBSP dried onion flakes\n\n1 1/2 tsp salt\n\n2 tsp granulated garlic \\*\n\n1 tsp cayenne pepper\n\n1 1/2 tsp oregano, dried\n\n2 tsp ground cumin\n\n1/4 tsp hot red pepper flakes\n\n\\* Granulated garlic is garlic that has been dried and ground. It is identified by its grainy, sand-like texture. Do not use garlic salt as the recipe will be too salty. Do not use garlic powder (which looks like flour) or the garlic flavor will be overwhelming. \n\n**Cookware and Utensils**\n\nInstant Pot (substitute regular pressure cooker)\n\nColander\n\nSmall bowl\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Rinse and drain the pinto beans in the colander. Add the drained pintos to the Instant Pot or pressure cooker.\n\n2. Add the water, tomatoes (do not drain), and the vegetable oil to the Instant Pot or pressure cooker. Stir to combine.\n\n3. Add the dried onion, salt, garlic, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin, and hot red pepper flakes to the small bowl. Stir to combine. Add the mixed seasonings to the Instant Pot or pressure cooker. Stir to combine.\n\n4. Fit the lid to the Instant Pot (or pressure cooker) and twist to seal. Program the Instant Pot for Pressure Cooking on High Pressure for 1 hour and 5 minutes (65 minutes). Press START to begin pressure cooking.\n\n5. At the end of the cooking period allow 10 minutes of natural pressure release. After 10 minutes you may perform a manual pressure release (use caution to avoid burns from hot steam escaping the pressure release vent) or just allow the pressure to naturally release before opening the Instant Pot or pressure cooker.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/fpn9g8/pressure_cooked_spicy_hot_texas_pinto_beans_recipe/", "created_utc": 1585269445.0, "score": 37, "author": "GoodCook10", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/fpn9g8/pressure_cooked_spicy_hot_texas_pinto_beans_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pot roast: The best thing I've ever made in my PC", "selftext": "I've never had pot roast that was half this flavorful. Perhaps I shouldn't oversell it, but I made this for some friends along with some steamed brussels sprouts and some baguettes that I baked myself and it's easily in the top 10 best things I've ever eaten.\n\nIt's basically just [this](http://www.pressurecookingtoday.com/classic-pot-roast-and-potatoes/) recipe without the tomato paste and mushrooms. I tried it with tomato paste a couple weeks ago and didn't think it was as good. I have not tried it with mushrooms but I'm sure they would be good.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n2.5lb chuck roast. The one that looks like a huge steak.\n\n\nkosher salt\n\n\ncoarse ground black pepper (I buy the big things of Tone's \"restaurant\" coarse pepper at Sam's Club)\n\nOne medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped\n\n\n1-2 TBSP butter\n\n\n3-4 TBSP vegetable oil\n\n\n3 cups beef broth\n\n\n1.5lbs bite-size potatoes\n\n1) Season the roast moderately with kosher salt and heavily with pepper.\n\n\n2) Get a big skillet screaming hot with a few tbsps of vegetable oil and THEN add the roast, being careful not to splash hot oil on yourself. Brown thoroughly on all sides. Keep sliding the roast around while it's browning to get it evenly browned. Tongs work well for manipulating it. On my stove this takes a couple minutes per side. I gave up on browning things in the PC itself. I have a Presto 6qt rocker top and it's just too small and it's not nonstick.\n\n\n3) Transfer the roast into the pressure cooker. It will barely fit in mine - I had to squish it in a bit to get it flat. I always use the little steamer rack on the bottom because I've had meat burn on the bottom in the past.\n\n\n4) Add the onion and butter to the skillet. Keep the stove on high or perhaps turn it down just a little to medium high. Cook the onion for a few minutes until it starts to brown. Try to scrape up the leftover pepper etc from browning the roast and incorporate it into the onion mixture. Next time I might throw in just a little stock or something at the end to deglaze the pan and help pick up all of that flavor.\n\n\n5) Add the onion to the PC\n\n\n6) Add the beef stock and the potatoes to the PC\n\n\n7) Pressure cook for 50 minutes and then do a natural release. \n\n\nThe one weak spot in this is the potatoes - they are OK, but they don't absorb the flavor as well as I'd like. Maybe if I poked them with a fork next time... \n\nIf you don't like to have a bunch of juice/sauce with your food you can back off on the stock quantity a little. I like to have a ton of juice to soak up with bread and so that I can get some meat and juice in every bite.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/5nl0xg/pot_roast_the_best_thing_ive_ever_made_in_my_pc/", "created_utc": 1484245568.0, "score": 35, "author": "Obvious0ne", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/5nl0xg/pot_roast_the_best_thing_ive_ever_made_in_my_pc/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

While I love my instant pot for most tasks,^(\u2020) and while pressure steaming eggs in the instant pot still beats conventional cooking, it was never quite as good as my old stove-top, and I think I figured out why.\n\nI don't think it's the pressure. My stovetop cooker does 90 KPa (about 13 psi over ambient) which I recall being a wee bit higher than the instant pot. My experience adapting recipes is that the slightly slower cooking speed in the instant pot is next to nothing.\n\nWhile it's a small sample size, (because I only did two eggs for breakfast) I think the key is the ability to do a really quick release. My pressure cooker's manual says I can run cold water over the cooker.^(\u2021) To do a quick release I move the cooker over to the sink and hold everything at a 45\u00b0angle.

{"title": "Instant Pot woes. Slow cooker and rice cooker functions are not impressing me thus far. How wrong am I doing it?", "selftext": "Greetings! \n\n\n\n\nGot my Instant Pot a few weeks ago to replace my FAGOR stovetop pressure cooker that failed, as well as a rice steamer/vege steamer, and my slow cooker. I'm a pretty experienced home chef of 40years. \n\n\n\n\nI have made rice in it twice so far, 2 to 1 water to rice ratio, and the rice has come out a little too wet both times. Am I supposed to cook rice using the rice setting with the vent in to open position? I am pretty sure the manual says to have it closed. \n\n\n\n\nThe slow cooker function seems to have too low a temp. I made a 3.5 to 4 lb pork butt a couple weeks ago, left it on \"normal\"....(medium), and it took 10 to 11 hrs to cook through. Even after that time it was still not that fall apart rich succulence that I used to get in the slow cooker. I am making a pork butt right now, and using the \"more\" setting. Its been 7 hours and the pork is not quite  cooked through. I have had the vent open to get some moisture out, should I have it closed? The slow cooker I got rid of produced a liquid simmer on low and the butt was cooked through at 4 -5 hours. I have no such simmer with the Instant Pot with the vent open. I've closed it now and await new results. \n\n\n\n\nMy biggest gripe so far is the pressure cooking method for vege. In my stovetop FAGOR I could cook 1/2 to 1lb of Broccoli/Green Beans/Cauliflower in 1/4C water for 3 to 4 minutes and have the most awesome tasting/most awesome textured vege ever. In the Instant Pot I use the manual function for 1 min and its overcooked. I have only used the high pressure setting though, hopefully the lower setting will yield better results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Instant Pot is said to have a learning curve, so I am trying to learn.

{"title": "Trying to cook pork shoulder, and finding contradictory recipes on the internet.", "selftext": "I bought a 8 lb bone-in chunk of pork shoulder to cook in the pressure cooker. I've done this only once before, and I can't find the recipe I used (that turned out perfect). So I searched, and ended up very confused.\n\nHere's what I ended up doing:\n\nMy cooker is a large stove-top model that goes to 15 psi. I cut the shoulder into about 5 pieces (following advice that said cut it into 2 lb chunks). The pieces fit in a single layer in the bottom of the pot. I added about 5 cups of water, which left the top inch or so of the meat exposed.  \n\nI put the heat on high and brought it up to 15 psi and the jiggly weight started rattling. I lowered the heat a bit, then raised it a little when the rattling stopped. I set the timer for about 40 minutes (I forgot to set it to begin with, so I estimated what the elapsed time had been when the rattling started).\n\nWhen the timer went off, I turned off the heat, and noticed that the pressure had gone up a little past 15 psi (maybe 16-17?). I moved the pot to a cold burner, and now it's hissing as it cools down.  I will wait for it to get back to room pressure before opening it up and seeing what I ended up with.\n\nMy goal is to shred the pork, and then use it to make tacos and pozole and stir fry, etc.  I'll keep the stock to make rice in, or use as a soup base.\n\nI was confused by the recipes that said \"cook 15 mins for each pound of meat\" which seems strange to me, because it's a giant pot, why would it matter how many pounds there are, especially since I was able to put them in one layer?  I decided to ignore this instruction and cook it for 45 minutes which is a time I saw in other recipes that talked about carnitas.\n\nSome people say cut it into 2\" chunks, other people say cut it into 2 pound chunks. Is it preferable to use a smaller size?  Why the variation in instructions?\n\nWhat does \"high pressure\" mean? Is that just another way of saying 15 psi?\n\nWhen I finally open the pot and see what's in there, how can I tell if it needs to be cooked more? And if it does, should I just cook it in a regular pot on the stove? Or pressure cook it some more?\n\nIf I overcooked it, is there anything I can do to make it better?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSo it turned out really nice and tender, falling apart as soon as I tried to pick it up.  Tongs were very difficult to use, lol.  Shredding it was annoying, because I don't like globs of fat, and it was hard to separate the fat from the meat.  I guess next time I should trim it before cooking (but let the fat stay in the pot for flavor).  I wonder if letting it cool more will make shredding easier, to give the fat time to solidify more?\n\nThe bone got super soft and crumbly; I didn't expect that.\n\nThank you everyone for your advice and encouragement!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/qqlpim/trying_to_cook_pork_shoulder_and_finding/", "created_utc": 1636517146.0, "score": 30, "author": "MoreRopePlease", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/qqlpim/trying_to_cook_pork_shoulder_and_finding/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Plantain stock", "selftext": "Where I live I can buy 3 plantains for a dollar or sometime 5 for a dollar if they are really ripe. Sometimes you can get a pair of plantains that grow fused together. These are lucky so I grab them when I see them as they are still priced the same as a single plantain. I usually stock up buying some every so many grocery trips, ripen them real good if needed (when the skin comes off real easy and you smell the sweetness you are ready), and freeze them whole after pealing.  I use them as needed throughout the year to make stock. No need to chop them up as there is no cooking advantage. \n\nTypically I use 3 or 4 whole pealed frozen plantains and put them in about 5 cups of water (you don't have to really measure just make certain they are well covered.) I cook them at pressure for 15 minutes. I do not add any spices or salt. You will smell the sweet flavors during this cooking time. Afterwards I let the pressure come down naturally and then strain the stock. The initially yellow/brown frozen plantains should be pinkish and fall apart on touch. \n\nThe broth is what you want so you have to strain out what is left of the plantains. These plantains are not even edible and are thrown out. I use a pasta strainer as that works well for me. But be sure to smash the plantains with the back of a spatula to get all the juice out. It hides in there.\n\nThis broth is really a good basis for cooking beans by PC. I usually use 1 lb of black beans or black eyed peas. These take longer to cook than other beans and work the best I have found. I soak the beans over night and then cook for 25 minutes at pressure. Add enough water so the beans are covered if you do not have enough stock. At this point I add salt and pepper  1.5 teaspoons each before cooking. \n\nAfter cooking I added in diced green chili peppers. The effect is you taste the chili then the bean and plantain stock. I buy lots of green chili peppers and freeze them. Cut them frozen then stir in to the hot beans and they will thaw quickly.\n\nI never freeze this stock btw. I freeze the plantains and make the stock as needed. Works easier for me. I also use my old Presto stove top cookers.\n\nThis is any easy cheap way to make a $1 bag of black beans into a great meal. I serve with my corn bread I posted, rice, or pasta. This easily serves a few ppl and a cheaper meal than a meat dish for well under $5. I bet others could find uses for this stock.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/5ezda4/plantain_stock/", "created_utc": 1480165347.0, "score": 30, "author": "Anagram64", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/5ezda4/plantain_stock/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pot Roast coming out tough", "selftext": "For reference, I have a Crockpot brand pressure cooker.

Takes a bit longer than standard cooking times for full creaminess (\\~40-50 min at pressure).\n\nI've had success adding baking soda to simmering chickpeas at atmospheric pressure, as this is a traditional means to speed breakdown of cellulose in their skins in Middle Eastern cooking.\n\nBut I've now had one kitchen disaster, and one near disaster, where adding baking soda to fully soaked chickpeas, in a pressure cooker that was only 1/4 full, lead to foaming chickpea broth that flowed through the pressure relief valve.\n\nThe first time the valve was blocked, leading to a secondary safety, failure of the silicone pressure seal around the rim, functioning properly.

{"title": "First Pressure Cooker Fail, Looking for Advice on Why", "selftext": "I've had my Instant Pot for a year and use it about once every week or 2. It's been a learning curve, but I've mostly had success with it and love using it. I've mostly made stews, roasts, shredded pork, chicken and dumplings, pasta dishes (okay, mac and cheese).\n\nYesterday was the first real problem I had. I made [Alton Brown's Pressure Cooker Chili](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pressure-cooker-chili-recipe.html) and followed the recipe exactly as written, except I set the pressure cooker to 30 minutes on high to account for having an electric model rather than a stovetop. \n\nLike I usually do, I sealed the top, set the timer and walked away. When I heard the timer go off, I walked into the kitchen and noticed that the pressure valve was still down. In my previous experiences, the timer never starts until the valve pops up. When I opened the pot, the food LOOKED good, but the meat was very undercooked and tough. I turned it back on high pressure for 5 minutes and watched it this time - again, the timer started after a minute or 2, but the valve was still down. It hissed and let some steam out, and then the steam stopped, but the valve was still down. It wouldn't come to pressure. I check the obvious things like making sure it wasn't set to vent, but everything seemed fine. \n\nI gave up and ate a bowl of tough, undercooked meat in a tasty sauce, but I will probably end up tossing most of it. I can't even feed it to the dog because it's too spicy. I'm really disappointed because I spent a good amount of money on this recipe. \n\nI imagine that the problem stemmed from the tortilla chips in the recipe, since they were the only thing really different about this recipe. The recipe started with a good amount of liquid - 12 oz of beer and 16 oz of a really thin salsa, plus the liquid the meat released - so I didn't think the chips would be a problem. At the end of cooking though, the sauce was really thick. Still liquid, but thick. I could tell from stirring it that there was some burning on the bottom of pot, something I've never run into before. \n\nWhat I really don't understand is this recipe got a lot of really good reviews, so obviously several people have made it successfully.

I've seen people pressure can quick breads against direct advice from the USDA, but I'm not risking botulism or trying to can in a pressure *cooker* either.  \n\nMy recipe adaptations are minor, using double acting baking powder instead of sour milk/buttermilk and baking soda, and using powdered milk instead of ~~fresh~~ cultured buttermilk, using foil instead of wax paper and string..\n\nBoiling water at sea level with the pressure cooker / instant pot for 15 minutes with the vent open would vent almost all of the oxygen and replace it with water vapor but I don't see the advantages of that Why not just cook under pressure for slightly longer? Regular air doesn't get hot enough? Likewise I don't see the reason for doing so when pressure canning but I do see it in recipes often.\n\n---\n**Edit to add:** see the discussion in [this post for one theory as to why.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaFoodiOurRecipes/comments/srm19k/boston_brown_bread/) (steaming at standard pressure probably allows the bread to get some initial rise, then the cooker is pressurized like normal to speed total cook time.)\n\n**Edit to add:**  USDA instructions for pressure canning say to **vent for 10 minutes otherwise the food being canned won't get as hot.** Unrelated to this recipe but still practiced.\n\n>Air is trapped in the closed canner during the process.

{"title": "Simple and Fast Pork Roast & Veggies", "selftext": "With the recent increases in food prices, I thought I'd post some meal recipes that I think are affordable, simple, and fast to make.\n\nFor $12.47 at my local Walmart is the \"Tyson Ready for Slow Cooker Pork Roast with Vegetables Meal Kit Boneless\", which is 3.9 lbs.  Aldi, Kroger, and many other grocery store chains have this product.\n\nThe package contains a fresh boneless pork roast that's sealed and separate from the fresh vegetables, which are small red potatoes, baby carrots, peeled yellow onion, and diced celery.  It also contains a seasoning packet.  The vegetables are already cleaned, prepped and ready to cook.\n\nInstead of the normal 3 to 8 hours of slow cooking, you can easily make this in under an hour in a pressure cooker.\n\nFor the better color and flavor, fry the roast in a couple of tablespoons of oil until it's nicely browned (not merely grey) on all sides over medium high heat in a stovetop pressure cooker or using sautee mode on an electric pressure cooker.\n\nIf you don't really care about browning the meat, you can skip that step.\n\nAdd 1 cup of water to the roast.  Add the spice packet contents, or add your own pot roast seasonings to the water.\n\nPut the vegetables on top of the roast.\n\nPut on the pressure cooker lid and seal the pressure valve, if needed.   Pressure cook for about 45 minutes in a stovetop pressure cooker at 15psi, or about 50 minutes in an electric pressure cooker at 12psi.\n\nIt's better to do a natural pressure release to ensure the meat is fully tenderized, but you can do a quick release too if you're in a hurry to get food on the table.\n\nTaste the liquid for salt and seasoning.  The liquid will be thin, but you can thicken it into a gravy many ways, the easiest is to simply crush one or two of the potatoes with a fork or masher for the starch to absorb the liquid.   You could also use instant potato flakes, a corn starch mixed with a little cold water to make a slurry, a gravy packet or granules, or a butter+flour mix (beurre manie).   Stir well while thickening briefly for a couple of minutes.\n\nInstead of buying this kit, you can make your own kit with frozen veggies, baby carrots or sliced/diced carrot, onions, garlic, etc., of course.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/tnza9y/simple_and_fast_pork_roast_veggies/", "created_utc": 1648242883.0, "score": 27, "author": "vapeducator", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/tnza9y/simple_and_fast_pork_roast_veggies/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "ISO advice from experienced PC users re: stovetop PC vs electric plug in types", "selftext": "Hi! I'm tired of certain cooking limitations from not using a PC and have been looking into getting one. I have a tiny kitchen with no counter space, or storage for the \"safer\" electric plug in style PC, so we've decided those aren't going to work for us. However, I have childhood memories of seeing a relative severely burned after deciding to \"check\" on my mom's stovetop PC, so i have some stovetop PC trauma. This has been a difficult choice for me, and I'm hoping that stovetop ones are fairly safe these days if the user (me) carefully reads the manual.\n\nI'm trying to decide between the 4 quart Presto stainless steel PC bec that size seems more manageable for me, or a 6 quart PC from Ikea. These two are the only stainless steel options under $100 that I've found. I don't have prime and try to avoid ordering from Amazon. Presto has free shipping, replacement parts availability, and a reasonably priced accessory lid for draining that I think would help me when using it by myself. The ikea option looks fairly easy to use, has inexpensive shipping, but I'm not sure about availability of replacement parts. I also don't know how safe these are. Do I need to be an expert PC user before buying a stovetop PC? I'm still a little worried about this.\n\nI cook for just two people and I think I'll be using it mostly for cooking potatoes, dried beans and possibly related soups and stews. My husband does want to try making soy yogurt, which I think we need an instant pot for, but I'm a little confused on this point. Optimally, I'm hoping the 4 quart will work for our minimal needs, but I'm worried it won't be big enough for yogurt making. We will never use it for cooking meats or for canning.\n\nOne last problem we're confused about is the plethora of instructions and recipes out there for instant pots. How easy is it to convert those to a stovetop PC, since I'm not an advanced cook? I hope that makes sense.  Please ignore if it doesn't. \ud83d\ude33\n\nI would love to hear from experienced users on whether I'm thinking about all this correctly, or if there's something I'm not considering. We're on a tight budget, so if I buy something, I'm really stuck with it. I think this could help us expand our meal options and save money, but only if i choose correctly.

{"title": "Breville/Sage fast slow pro inner pot", "selftext": "Hi everyone, found some posts regarding the inner pot for this particular model. Coating do wears over time if you cook too acidic or too alcaline foods like I do. This particular model comes with a cast aluminium with a thin ceramic coating with measurements of 240 mm wide(to the lip) and 264.7mm in height.\nAfter measuring thoroughly the deformation of the seal, disassembling different parts and trying to understand the security measures on the lid I was confident that the tolerance in height was significant. I decided to test a compatible stainless steel inner pot with measurements of 240 mm (to the lip) and 260 mm height. \nThe first test I did was a heat transmission, this I measured by adding 1 kg of water to the pot and measuring the time to boil from room temperature (using the reduce function). I did this 3 times and found no difference at all. I must add that in the stainless steel pot heat transmission seems to be non linear, but was to lazy to keep testing.\nThe second test I did was a seal test. First I tested five minutes to low pressure to see if the seal holds. Found no problem at all. The second time I tested five minutes to full pressure, I noticed pressure climbs neglectably faster, but I wasn't testing for time so it was just perception. It did hold with no problem and no excessive venting.\nMy conclusion is that although there are differences, those are not significant enough to say that the fast slow pro will behave differently.

This dish was then carefully lowered into the pot on top of the rice. Obviously I worked out the quantities with some care as it wouldn't do to over-fill. I then heated till just about to whistle, and dropped the flame way down to simply hold it at that pressure for 5 mins. Cooled naturally while frying a tadka for the dal. (Almost) one pot meal and very tasty! Next time I'll give the dal a longer pre-soak, the rice wouldn't have wanted cooking any longer and the dal could have used another minute maybe.

{"title": "Fissler Vitaquick - First time use and preparations\n", "selftext": "Hi everyone! Not sure what title to go with, so I just went with this one. I recently bought my first pressure cooker, a Fissler Vitaquick 8L (or about 8.45qt). I bought this online so I never got the chance to speak to a sales rep. I've not seen advice like this anywhere else (happy to be corrected), so here goes. \n\nThis was my very first pressure cooker, and I assumed it would work right out of the box like any other pan but boy was I wrong. It wouldn't seal, steam kept escaping out the manual release, pressure indicator would not rise, and water would continuously escape the main seal. \n\nI took it back to the shop for a warranty claim but the moment the sales rep noticed that this was an online order, she immediately asked if I had \"prepped\" the main seal. For whatever reason, the main rubber seal is stiff and needs to be massaged a little to bring back its flexiblity needed for a good seal. \n\nShe then helped to pry open the inner side of seal to a lil under 90 degrees, and made about two full rounds. After which she filled the pot, and put it on a burner to demonstrate that the pot would hold pressure, and that the handle would not budge under pressure. I walked away a happy customer. Bought a steam basket as well (thankfully with some coupons). \n\nDisclaimer: This advice of course does not discount the possibility that the other seals are faulty since I've heard that there was a faulty batch of Fisslers at some point.

{"title": "A little worried with Tefal ONE POT CY505E30", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have a quite new Tefal ONE POT CY505E30 that was used a total of around 5 times. During my last 2 usages I've noticed that it takes around 30 minutes to build up the needed pressure/temperature while using 2 cups of rice and 2 cups of water (around 160-200 ml of water, so keep the ratio 1:1 or even slightly less water). I did clean the cover and it looks very clean after each cooking in general. I clean the rice from starch before cooking. During my first cookings I recall it took only 15-20 minute to build the pressure, but I didn't time in precisely just approximately.\n\nThe 9 minute of cooking just finished and the pot is very hot, BUT I am able to open the cover if I want and when I press the button to manually release pressure nothing happens. The questions are is it safe to open the lid and why no pressure escapes when I press the button?\n\nDuring my first couple of cookings there was always a lot of pressure left just after finishing cooking (counter passes 9 minutes and beeps). I mean I had to hold the button to release pressure for like full 10-15 seconds. Now I am worried that it seems like the locking mechanism doesn't work and the button to release the pressure also don't work. Or am I wrong in assuming this and the pressure cooker somehow releases the pressure from the safety valve without me hearing it in the other room?\n\nAfter writing this I just noticed the cooker was slightly colder on the top, so I opened it carefully and indeed there is barely any pressure left and the rice is cooked perfectly! :) I just don't understand why the major difference between my first couple of cookings and the last two, BUT I do recall I used more water during the first tries (around 1:1.5 ratio), so it should be related. Most likely what happens is the steam is getting absorbed quite well when using around 1:1 ratio thus reducing the pressure faster.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1dsrv5f/a_little_worried_with_tefal_one_pot_cy505e30/", "created_utc": 1719837255.0, "score": 4, "author": "mentalhealth1989", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1dsrv5f/a_little_worried_with_tefal_one_pot_cy505e30/", "html_title": ""}

Let's say if the 6.5 liter sized pressure cooker requires 1 cup of water so would the larger 12.5 liter sized pressure cooker require 2 cups of water to cook that amount of chicken?\n\nSecond question:\n2. I understand 6.5 liter pressure cooker will build up or come to full pressure faster than larger 12.5 liter pressure cooker due pan volume and water amount.And release the pressure earlier than the larger sized pressure cooker.\n\n Question is approximately how much time  difference would I see between the 6.5 liter pressure cooker and 12.5 liter pressure cooker in building up of pressure and releasing of some of that pressure in the first whistle? \n\nLet's say for example the smaller 6.5 liter cooker builds up pressure and releases it in the first whistle in approximately 8 to 10 minutes.So how much time the 12.5 liter pressure cooker would take for build up pressure and releasing some of that in the first whistle? Approximately 13 to 15 minutes or longer like 17 to 20 minutes?\n\nQuestion 3. After building up of pressure and releasing of some of that pressure in the first whistle on both 6.5 liter pressure cooker and 12.5 liter cooker does the rest of cooking process of those 4 kg chicken take noticeably different amount of time?Or rest of the cooking process on both those pressure cookers roughly take more or less same amount of time without any noticeable  difference in time?\n\nQuestion 4. After the cooking is done does the natural release of pressure take longer for 12.5 liter cooker compared to 6.5 liter cooker?How much difference in time between these two above mentioned sized pressure cooker?Let's say 6.5 liter cooker takes more or less 15 minutes to naturally release  pressure after the flame is turned off.How long approximately it would take for 12.5 liter cooker to naturally release pressure after the flame is turned of?\n\nThank you for reading the wall of text.Please do share your experience in a reply or two.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1bg4fhq/so_a_couple_of_things_i_need_to_know_about/", "created_utc": 1710590297.0, "score": 3, "author": "Skeuomorph7", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1bg4fhq/so_a_couple_of_things_i_need_to_know_about/", "html_title": ""}

Originally I started with an 8L model, then I got a smaller one (2L?) for making rice.\n\nMy wife is Japanese and pressure cooked rice is her preference, especially for Haiga rice, which is a sort of hybrid brown/white rice. (Zojirushi makes a rice cooker that does pressure cooked rice, but it's not as fast as a 15 PSI pressure cooker and results are not as good, IMHO.)\n\nI used my pressure cooker for everything initially, but ideally they work best for meats, grains, and beans. For vegetables, other than root veggies, I found it too difficult to time tenderness consistently.\n\nFor the Kuhn Rikon pots I had to replace the main gaskets once or maybe twice, plus some of the plug gaskets in the lid which got hard. I used both, often daily.\n\nEventually both pots stopped sealing well when building pressure. Meaning, steam would escape and pressure would not build. Pulling on the spring often caused them to seal and build pressure. I'm guessing it was simply a gasket issue but they never worked consistently after replacing the gaskets.\n\nI also used an induction burner. I got one since the counter top burners have a timer which was useful for making rice. Eventually uneven heating expansion caused the bottom plates to warp and separate from the aluminum layers. Once the bottom plate warps it will eventually peel off, unfortunately.\n\nOnce I updated my kitchen range to induction range, I could no longer use either one pot. I tried buying two new steel plates but I had no way to reliably glue the plates in place. They would eventually separate.\n\nIf I bought a gas stove, not induction, I probably would keep them.\n\nKuhn Rikon did not offer any way to repair them. I had considered asking some local metal fabricators in Seattle if they could help but it just seems sensible to give both away. (If you want them, PM me, I want them to have a good home.)\n\nOther complaints: Yes they are initially very shiny and pretty. But unfortunately, they eventually will get greasy and dull. I've spent time scrubbing them but they go back to being dull. I also lost broke both lid caps, and replaced them both and they broke again.\n\nI also have an Insta-Pot and aluminum pot I got for camping\u2013was only like $25. The Insta-Pot works well enough but takes time to heat up and isn't as fast. Aluminum pots aren't easy to clean but I admire the simple design of it compared to the KR.\n\nI decided to go with Fissler/Vitaquick Premium pots, mainly since the bottom induction plate seems to be less likely to separate.

In a home made verde sauce.\n\nThen I mix the two, but it's time consuming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut i've recently bought some Instant Pot cookbooks (I own a Ninja Foodi) that have combined recipes, and wildly different cooking times. How can you cook rice and chicken together when they have different cooking times and liquid?\n\nFor example I have a Mexican Instant Pot cookbook for \"Arroz Con Pollo\" that says 1.5 lbs of chicken, 2 cups of white rice with only 1.5 cups of broth!  And it called for a 20 minute pressure cook and 10 min release! This was with long grain/basmati white rice. This wayyy less liquid and wayyy more cooking time than for rice itself. The recipe did say to use the \"Meat/Stew\" setting, which my Ninja doesn't have. But the internet tells me Meat/Stew is just a Instant Pot preset for a 35 minute pressure cook on High. How can rice cook for 20 minutes when by itself it turns out great at just 2 minutes?\n\nI have an Indian cookbook for a chicken biryani with basmati rice that has a 1:1 rice ratio (as opposed to 1:1.25 for Ninja Foodi's standard white rice cooking guidelines). And it calls for a 6 minute pressure cook with 5 minute natural release. Again, higher than what's called for rice alone, less than what's called for chicken. Is it because of the lower natural relase time (5 min vs 10)\n\nI just want to get to the point where I can cook myself. But now i'm confused as I see recipes with meat+grain dishes having wildly different recipes, I don't want my rice to be overcooked/undercooked/burnt/soggy. Or my meat to be undercooked/well done. And if I want to not follow a cookbook, how do I determine the water and cooking times for 1 pot recipes on my own?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/17x02xw/cooking_times_for_1_pot_rice_meat_dishes/", "created_utc": 1700175407.0, "score": 6, "author": "xagent003", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/17x02xw/cooking_times_for_1_pot_rice_meat_dishes/", "html_title": ""}

Don't throw out your old Fagor pots. They still have lots of life.

{"title": "Impressions of Zavor Duo and Fissler Vitaquick (small review)", "selftext": "Splitting up with your partner after 11 years involves a lot of pain, and one of those pains is that I am losing my old, trusty, pressure-cookers(a 6 quart Presto, my favorite, and a 6 quart Lagostina). But, I decided to turn this into an opportunity to maybe upgrade.  So, I settled on a budget and went hunting.  I ended up getting a Fissler Vitaquick 6 quarts and Zavor Duo 8 quarts(much cheaper than the fissler 8 ).  I was also eyeing the Presto 8 quarts(stainless steel version), but I prefer to have an handle, so I decided to give Zavor a try instead.   Here is a quick review of both.\n\nAs a small backgroud, I've cooked with pressure-cookers ever since I left home 30 years ago.  And before that, my mother used them extensively to save cooking time (raised on a farm where time is precious)  I also tried using multipurpose electric pressure cooker, but simply never really liked those and I am using exclusively stovetop units now.\n\nFirst, the Zavor.  When it arrived, I had some bones ready to make beef broth, so I was able to quickly test it.  First thing I noticed when I got it out of the box is the weight.  It was insanely light for the size.  I admit this did not sit well with me.  The bottom was not as thick as I would have liked, and the sides appeared real thin too, having almost a crystal ring to it when I hit it with my nail. The silicone ring seemed a tad too small for the top too, and didn\u2019t look as solid as what I was used with Presto.   But hey, as long as it cook nicely, right?  So, I cleaned it, made sure everything was in working order(using the manual as reference) and was about to start making the broth when I noticed something\u2026 The manual stated 18/10 stainless steel, just like the store website, but the box said: 18/8.  Uh?  So I wrote to Zavor to verify.  I then proceeded to make the broth.  Well, my enthusiasm died as quickly as the pressure rose.  There are lot of things I instantly disliked about this unit.  First, while the pressure build, there is a lot of water dripping from the handle, and some steam comes out on all side while the ring expand in its spot.  Second, when it reached the right pressure, the \u201cexhaust\u201d is on the side of the cover, and it send the steam downward.  The problem?  If you use the right side element of your oven, you are about 100% sure the steam will get directly on your countertop!!!  Third, that thing was dripping water from the left side too.  I stopped everything, made sure the ring was positioned ok(it was), I removed the handle and made sure all was tight (it was) and restarted the process.  Same result, water dripping by the handle, and once pressure was reached, additional dripping on the left side.  Looking online, I saw I was not the only one with that problem.   Plus, the handle still wiggled a bit left to right when the steam is at 15 psi.  That wasn\u2019t reassuring, I am used to handles locking completely when the pressure is reached.  Keeping the steam at the right level was on par with what I was used to with my Presto, meaning I could lower the temp to mid-level, but not more.   I made the broth, but I was disenchanted at the functionality of the device.  Having to constantly wipe the excess water dripping on the heating surface, and making sure the outgoing steam doesn\u2019t touch the counter, is no fun.  A day later, the final nail in the coffin arrived when Zavor confirmed their \u201cnew\u201d factory, in China,  only made 18/8 stainless steel and they were in the process of updating the documentation.  Call it what you want, that\u2019s false advertisement, period.  I contacted the store who was very surprised at the change in stainless steel quality, and promptly told me to return the unit and that I would get a full refund, which I did.  Zavor is out.  Forever.  In that price range, I would select Presto(stainless steel version) or T-Fal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to the Fissler 6 quarts, which arrived a few days later.  Taking it out of the box immediately felt good.  A good weight, but still easily used with one hand only.  A thick base, and sides that doesn\u2019t sound like crystal.  The sealing ring is also very thick and looks like it will last a long time.  And man does everything simply feel solid.  I decided to make rice for a quick test that evening, since that is a very good indicator if a base is thick enough(when too thin, the rice will stick or burn at the bottom).  Both my presto and Lagostina had some trouble with rice, especially the lagostina.  The unit is so silent that I was stunned when I saw the pressure level rise to the second bar, indicating the pressure was now at 15 psi.  I am so used to seeing more steam come out when it reach the right pressure!  After 3 minutes I cut the heat and let it depressurize over 10 minutes.  Well, the rice was puuurrrfect!  My oldest even commented on how it was \u201cjust right\u201d.  Not a single grain burned or stuck at the bottom.  I was impressed!  The next days I tried it again to make a beef stew, to test how it goes over a longer period.  Again, it reached 15 psi in complete silence, and once it reached 2 bars I had to lower the heat to the lowest setting!  I was able to forget about it for the next 25 mins without worries.  That means the base is really good at keeping the temperature stable.  After that 25 mins, I depressurised manually. This was easily done with the handle, but I admit having it comes out in a \u201cV\u201d shape makes for some gymnastic to make sure the steam doesn\u2019t go on a surface it shouldn\u2019t.  Then added the vegetables for another 5 mins at high pressure.  The stew was perfect.  Meat was melting in the mouth, and the vegetables had that nice beef broth taste.   I love \u201calmost\u201d everything about that unit.  It is sturdy, the cover locks perfectly, manual steam release is easy, no chance of burning yourself when doing so, no wiggling on the handle, the extra steam comes out on top while cooking(when it comes out, because, as mentioned, there are barely any coming out at all!!). Cleaning was super easy.  The only downside?  The 6 quarts base could be a tad wider IMHO, to help with browning more meat.\n\nI so loved this unit that I simply decided to get the 8 quarts version too to replace the Zavor, even though it busted the budget I had planned for the pressure cookers.(luckily, I managed to get both size on sale on Fissler website, so it wasn\u2019t so bad in the end)  After 3 weeks, I haven\u2019t a single regret.  They are a joy to use and the food comes out perfectly cooked and extra tasty every time.  And with the 8 quarts, I can now buy any chicken size without having to worry if it will fit or not.\n\nNow, if I ever get married again, I\u2019m making sure to have a contract signed that I keep both of these cookers if things goes south in the future :P", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1094k5b/impressions_of_zavor_duo_and_fissler_vitaquick/", "created_utc": 1673443296.0, "score": 21, "author": "kinwolf", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1094k5b/impressions_of_zavor_duo_and_fissler_vitaquick/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I cut the old stewing hen into pieces because I aim for gelatinous broth, thats most important to me.\n\nThen I cover the chicken with water, just an inch above the chicken. The water to chicken ratio is always 1.5 parts (max 2) of water for every 1 part of chicken and I typically finish up with about as much finished stock as water I added in the beginning, minus a bit for evaporation. Then I bring everything to a boil, reduce the heat and let it pressure cook for 75 minutes. After 75 Minutes \"quick\" pressure release. The stock is always very rich and gelatinous, always! I always use the same chickens, same chicken to water ratio etc.\n\nNow I tried several chickens in the instant pot and I'm very disappointed because the stock is not gelatinous at all, very thin and I end up with more liquid then I start with. In my pressure cooker it\u00b4s always less stock like I mentioned.\n\nI tried:\n\n\\-high pressure, 75 minutes, keep warm, quick release after 10 minutes = like water\n\n\\-high pressure, 75 minutes, keep warm, natural release 58 minutes until the vent drops = watery but the \"thickest\" one\n\n\\-high pressure, 60 minutes, natural release 46 minutes until the vent drops = like water\n\n\\-high pressure, 90 minutes, natural release 48 minutes until the vent drops = like water\n\n**What am I doing wrong?**\n\nI am very desperate and frustrated...\n\nI appreciate every tipp, help and suggestion.\n\nI\u00b4m also willing to pay for advice, in advance of course!!!

I can't rely on the moisture in the chicken or beef right? (I know the answer is likely yes just establishing that fact)\n\nfor stews or tomato sauce based sauces how do you end up with a thicker broth at the end of the cooking?  for instance if i wanted to make chicken breasts in spagetti sauce am i only cooking the chicken by itself, removing the water, adding the sauce, then switching to a slow cook?

{"title": "Simple and Fast Turkey Cajun Dirty Rice", "selftext": "With the recent increases in food prices, I thought I'd post some pressure cooker meal recipes that I think are affordable, simple, and fast to make.\n\nI frequently make my own version of Cajun Dirty rice, which I make no claim to be authentic, but is quite delicious and I think is something that's worth trying and making with your own preferences in mind.\n\nMy local Walmart has Festive-brand frozen ground turkey for $2.20 per pound, and turkey breakfast sausage for $2.10 per pound.  Either can be used for this recipe, although I prefer the seasoned sausage flavor.  You may use ground beef, ground pork, and/or ground sausage, as well as sliced smoked sausages or hotlinks of the spice level you like.  Ground meat of some kind is usually the basis of dirty rice, but lots of additions are OK to make your own hybrid.  Some recipes add chicken livers - I don't.\n\nWalmart has Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix - Family Size, 12 oz., for $2.08 per box.  The Zatarain's Jambalaya mix is similar, so you can use that instead if you wish.  Zatarain's products are widely available at many supermarket chains.   If you can't find the mix, use a 2 cups of parboiled/converted rice, 2 teaspoons Tony Chachere\u2019s Creole seasoning, and 2 teaspoons of Better than Bouillon roasted vegetable base (or other good bouillon), and 3 cups of water, to be added per the recipe instructions below after the sauteeing has been done.\n\nI would be quite derelict of my duty if I failed to stress the importance of the [Cajun Holy Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_\\(cooking\\)) of onions, bell peppers and celery for this recipe, which have the fundamental flavors of this cuisine, as well as Cajun dark roux of flour that's well toasted in oil and/or butter.  Unfortunately, I think the process of making a proper dark roux is out of scope for my mission of a simple & fast recipe, so please pardon me if I take some shortcuts in that regard in the interest of my goal here.  I have included a source of jarred dark roux for those who consider it required, although you're at liberty to make your own dark roux, of course.\n\nTwo parts of the Holy Trinity are easily obtained with the Walmart Great Value Pepper & Onion Blend, Frozen, 20 oz, $2.33, which contains sliced red and green bell peppers, with onion.  Kroger has something very similar:  Kroger Recipe Beginnings 3 Pepper & Onion Blend 12 oz for $1.39.  ALDI and many other stores have something similar: frozen bell peppers and onions, already cut and prepped.  Use whatever you find that's available.\n\nOnly the celery part of the Trinity is missing from that veggie mix.  So you can get some fresh celery, wash it and slice a couple of stalk of it if you wish.  Or you can use a little bit of celery salt or ground celery seed, less than half a teaspoon.  Or you can skip it.\n\nExtra rice can be used to stretch the meat and flavor into a larger batch.  Use rinsed long grain white rice or parboiled rice, preferably the latter.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pound of ground meat/protein, I use Festive Turkey Breakfast Sausage 16oz.\n\n* 1 20oz bag frozen peppers and onion mix,  2 12oz. bags, or whatever you want\n\n* 1 box Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix - Family Size, 12 oz.\n\n* approx. 2 tablespoons of oil.\n\n* optional 1/4 cup [Karys Dark Roux](https://www.amazon.com/Karys-Dark-Roux-16-Pack/dp/B08KQJPMYY/)\n\n* optional: extra dry rice, parboiled or long grain, plus 1.5 cups extra water per cup of dry rice.  Boost seasonings by at least 1 teaspoon per cup of liquid, so 1.5 teaspoons of Better than Bouillon Roasted Vegetable base and/or Tony Checheres Seasoning.\n\nInstructions:\n\nThaw any frozen meat, safely.   I transfer the frozen turkey sausage from freezer to fridge the night before cooking, if I remember.   I have a wiz bang newfangled inverter microwave oven that can thaw the turkey perfectly in 12 minutes, without cooking it.\n\nStart heating a 4qt. or larger stovetop pressure cooker over medium heat or start Saute mode on an electric pressure cooker.\n\nAdd 2 tablespoons of neutral cooking oil (your choice) to the pressure cooker, or spray with non-stick oil spray, or both.\n\nFry/saute the meat/protein until nicely browned in the oil, not merely gray color.  It's ok it it sticks to the pot, just don't let it smoke excessively or burn.  Brown is good.\n\nFor health reasons for those on a lower fat diet, you can remove/drain any excess oil/grease if you wish at this point or after frying the veggies in it.\n\nAdd the pepper/onion mix to the meat (whether the veggies are frozen or fresh, doesn't matter).  You may add sliced celery too.  Feel free to add other diced/sliced veggies, including diced carrot, more onion, minced/crushed garlic, chili peppers, etc.  You're eating it.  Use what you like.\n\nYou may saute or lightly brown the veggies, if you wish for more flavor.  You may add 1/4 cup of the dark roux (optional).\n\nAdd 1 12oz. box of Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix to the veggies & meat, stir briefly to absorb the oils and liquids with the rice mix.\n\nAdd 3.5 cups water.  (this is a little bit less than the box instructions because of the extra moisture in the veggies.)\n\nAt this point, you may add extra dry rice, water and seasonings per instructions above, to stretch the recipe.\n\nStir the liquid well with a long cooking spoon or spatula to dissolve any of the browned proteins that stuck to the bottom of the pot.  This will prevent burn warnings on electric pressure cookers.\n\nI suggest tasting the cooking liquid for seasoning balance at this point so that it can be adjusted to taste before pressure cooking the rice.\n\nBring up to pressure to cook for 6 minutes in a stovetop or electric pressure cooker.\n\nA natural pressure release is NOT necessary for rice, but you can do so if you wish.  I always quick release or do a cold-water release with my stovetop pressure cookers for this recipe.\n\nThis recipe normally takes me less than 15 minutes (except for thawing the meat) from start to finish and costs less than $7 total, not per serving.  It's a good balance of meat/protein, spices, flavorful veggies, and rice without being extra spicy hot.  You can make it that way too.  It can be doubled or tripled with no problem, so long as the total liquid+rice remains below the suggested max fill line on your pressure cooker.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/tpds9f/simple_and_fast_turkey_cajun_dirty_rice/", "created_utc": 1648360889.0, "score": 56, "author": "vapeducator", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/tpds9f/simple_and_fast_turkey_cajun_dirty_rice/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Simple and Fast Pork Roast & Veggies", "selftext": "With the recent increases in food prices, I thought I'd post some meal recipes that I think are affordable, simple, and fast to make.\n\nFor $12.47 at my local Walmart is the \"Tyson Ready for Slow Cooker Pork Roast with Vegetables Meal Kit Boneless\", which is 3.9 lbs.  Aldi, Kroger, and many other grocery store chains have this product.\n\nThe package contains a fresh boneless pork roast that's sealed and separate from the fresh vegetables, which are small red potatoes, baby carrots, peeled yellow onion, and diced celery.  It also contains a seasoning packet.  The vegetables are already cleaned, prepped and ready to cook.\n\nInstead of the normal 3 to 8 hours of slow cooking, you can easily make this in under an hour in a pressure cooker.\n\nFor the better color and flavor, fry the roast in a couple of tablespoons of oil until it's nicely browned (not merely grey) on all sides over medium high heat in a stovetop pressure cooker or using sautee mode on an electric pressure cooker.\n\nIf you don't really care about browning the meat, you can skip that step.\n\nAdd 1 cup of water to the roast.  Add the spice packet contents, or add your own pot roast seasonings to the water.\n\nPut the vegetables on top of the roast.\n\nPut on the pressure cooker lid and seal the pressure valve, if needed.   Pressure cook for about 45 minutes in a stovetop pressure cooker at 15psi, or about 50 minutes in an electric pressure cooker at 12psi.\n\nIt's better to do a natural pressure release to ensure the meat is fully tenderized, but you can do a quick release too if you're in a hurry to get food on the table.\n\nTaste the liquid for salt and seasoning.  The liquid will be thin, but you can thicken it into a gravy many ways, the easiest is to simply crush one or two of the potatoes with a fork or masher for the starch to absorb the liquid.   You could also use instant potato flakes, a corn starch mixed with a little cold water to make a slurry, a gravy packet or granules, or a butter+flour mix (beurre manie).   Stir well while thickening briefly for a couple of minutes.\n\nInstead of buying this kit, you can make your own kit with frozen veggies, baby carrots or sliced/diced carrot, onions, garlic, etc., of course.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/tnza9y/simple_and_fast_pork_roast_veggies/", "created_utc": 1648242883.0, "score": 26, "author": "vapeducator", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/tnza9y/simple_and_fast_pork_roast_veggies/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Trying to cook pork shoulder, and finding contradictory recipes on the internet.", "selftext": "I bought a 8 lb bone-in chunk of pork shoulder to cook in the pressure cooker. I've done this only once before, and I can't find the recipe I used (that turned out perfect). So I searched, and ended up very confused.\n\nHere's what I ended up doing:\n\nMy cooker is a large stove-top model that goes to 15 psi. I cut the shoulder into about 5 pieces (following advice that said cut it into 2 lb chunks). The pieces fit in a single layer in the bottom of the pot. I added about 5 cups of water, which left the top inch or so of the meat exposed.  \n\nI put the heat on high and brought it up to 15 psi and the jiggly weight started rattling. I lowered the heat a bit, then raised it a little when the rattling stopped. I set the timer for about 40 minutes (I forgot to set it to begin with, so I estimated what the elapsed time had been when the rattling started).\n\nWhen the timer went off, I turned off the heat, and noticed that the pressure had gone up a little past 15 psi (maybe 16-17?). I moved the pot to a cold burner, and now it's hissing as it cools down.  I will wait for it to get back to room pressure before opening it up and seeing what I ended up with.\n\nMy goal is to shred the pork, and then use it to make tacos and pozole and stir fry, etc.  I'll keep the stock to make rice in, or use as a soup base.\n\nI was confused by the recipes that said \"cook 15 mins for each pound of meat\" which seems strange to me, because it's a giant pot, why would it matter how many pounds there are, especially since I was able to put them in one layer?  I decided to ignore this instruction and cook it for 45 minutes which is a time I saw in other recipes that talked about carnitas.\n\nSome people say cut it into 2\" chunks, other people say cut it into 2 pound chunks. Is it preferable to use a smaller size?  Why the variation in instructions?\n\nWhat does \"high pressure\" mean? Is that just another way of saying 15 psi?\n\nWhen I finally open the pot and see what's in there, how can I tell if it needs to be cooked more? And if it does, should I just cook it in a regular pot on the stove? Or pressure cook it some more?\n\nIf I overcooked it, is there anything I can do to make it better?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSo it turned out really nice and tender, falling apart as soon as I tried to pick it up.  Tongs were very difficult to use, lol.  Shredding it was annoying, because I don't like globs of fat, and it was hard to separate the fat from the meat.  I guess next time I should trim it before cooking (but let the fat stay in the pot for flavor).  I wonder if letting it cool more will make shredding easier, to give the fat time to solidify more?\n\nThe bone got super soft and crumbly; I didn't expect that.\n\nThank you everyone for your advice and encouragement!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/qqlpim/trying_to_cook_pork_shoulder_and_finding/", "created_utc": 1636517146.0, "score": 30, "author": "MoreRopePlease", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/qqlpim/trying_to_cook_pork_shoulder_and_finding/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "ISO advice from experienced PC users re: stovetop PC vs electric plug in types", "selftext": "Hi! I'm tired of certain cooking limitations from not using a PC and have been looking into getting one. I have a tiny kitchen with no counter space, or storage for the \"safer\" electric plug in style PC, so we've decided those aren't going to work for us. However, I have childhood memories of seeing a relative severely burned after deciding to \"check\" on my mom's stovetop PC, so i have some stovetop PC trauma. This has been a difficult choice for me, and I'm hoping that stovetop ones are fairly safe these days if the user (me) carefully reads the manual.\n\nI'm trying to decide between the 4 quart Presto stainless steel PC bec that size seems more manageable for me, or a 6 quart PC from Ikea. These two are the only stainless steel options under $100 that I've found. I don't have prime and try to avoid ordering from Amazon. Presto has free shipping, replacement parts availability, and a reasonably priced accessory lid for draining that I think would help me when using it by myself. The ikea option looks fairly easy to use, has inexpensive shipping, but I'm not sure about availability of replacement parts. I also don't know how safe these are. Do I need to be an expert PC user before buying a stovetop PC? I'm still a little worried about this.\n\nI cook for just two people and I think I'll be using it mostly for cooking potatoes, dried beans and possibly related soups and stews. My husband does want to try making soy yogurt, which I think we need an instant pot for, but I'm a little confused on this point. Optimally, I'm hoping the 4 quart will work for our minimal needs, but I'm worried it won't be big enough for yogurt making. We will never use it for cooking meats or for canning.\n\nOne last problem we're confused about is the plethora of instructions and recipes out there for instant pots. How easy is it to convert those to a stovetop PC, since I'm not an advanced cook? I hope that makes sense.  Please ignore if it doesn't. \ud83d\ude33\n\nI would love to hear from experienced users on whether I'm thinking about all this correctly, or if there's something I'm not considering. We're on a tight budget, so if I buy something, I'm really stuck with it. I think this could help us expand our meal options and save money, but only if i choose correctly.

{"title": "Breville/Sage fast slow pro inner pot", "selftext": "Hi everyone, found some posts regarding the inner pot for this particular model. Coating do wears over time if you cook too acidic or too alcaline foods like I do. This particular model comes with a cast aluminium with a thin ceramic coating with measurements of 240 mm wide(to the lip) and 264.7mm in height.\nAfter measuring thoroughly the deformation of the seal, disassembling different parts and trying to understand the security measures on the lid I was confident that the tolerance in height was significant. I decided to test a compatible stainless steel inner pot with measurements of 240 mm (to the lip) and 260 mm height. \nThe first test I did was a heat transmission, this I measured by adding 1 kg of water to the pot and measuring the time to boil from room temperature (using the reduce function). I did this 3 times and found no difference at all. I must add that in the stainless steel pot heat transmission seems to be non linear, but was to lazy to keep testing.\nThe second test I did was a seal test. First I tested five minutes to low pressure to see if the seal holds. Found no problem at all. The second time I tested five minutes to full pressure, I noticed pressure climbs neglectably faster, but I wasn't testing for time so it was just perception. It did hold with no problem and no excessive venting.\nMy conclusion is that although there are differences, those are not significant enough to say that the fast slow pro will behave differently.

This dish was then carefully lowered into the pot on top of the rice. Obviously I worked out the quantities with some care as it wouldn't do to over-fill. I then heated till just about to whistle, and dropped the flame way down to simply hold it at that pressure for 5 mins. Cooled naturally while frying a tadka for the dal. (Almost) one pot meal and very tasty! Next time I'll give the dal a longer pre-soak, the rice wouldn't have wanted cooking any longer and the dal could have used another minute maybe.

I recently bought my first pressure cooker, a Fissler Vitaquick 8L (or about 8.45qt). I bought this online so I never got the chance to speak to a sales rep. I've not seen advice like this anywhere else (happy to be corrected), so here goes. \n\nThis was my very first pressure cooker, and I assumed it would work right out of the box like any other pan but boy was I wrong. It wouldn't seal, steam kept escaping out the manual release, pressure indicator would not rise, and water would continuously escape the main seal. \n\nI took it back to the shop for a warranty claim but the moment the sales rep noticed that this was an online order, she immediately asked if I had \"prepped\" the main seal. For whatever reason, the main rubber seal is stiff and needs to be massaged a little to bring back its flexiblity needed for a good seal. \n\nShe then helped to pry open the inner side of seal to a lil under 90 degrees, and made about two full rounds. After which she filled the pot, and put it on a burner to demonstrate that the pot would hold pressure, and that the handle would not budge under pressure. I walked away a happy customer. Bought a steam basket as well (thankfully with some coupons). \n\nDisclaimer: This advice of course does not discount the possibility that the other seals are faulty since I've heard that there was a faulty batch of Fisslers at some point.

{"title": "Pressure Cooking Proteins ", "selftext": "  \nI've all but given up on using the Crock-Pot/ using a slow-cooker for most everything except for soup because of the bad, gamey, and \"off\" flavor that slow-cooked meat takes on. \n\nSlow-cooking seems to change the flavor of proteins. Sirloin/Chuck/Rib-Eye thinly-cut strips (for a cheesesteak sub) are amazing via quick + hot searing in a pan but the same strips slow-cooked are terrible (rank + gamey). \n\nGround beef made into hamburger patties and cooked via BBQ taste good. That same ground beef (cooked for a long period) in a Crock-Pot becomes gamey. That goes triple for ground turkey. I've experienced this with chicken quarters, leg-of-lamb, ribs, ground meats, ...all proteins (not seafood or shellfish since they would never be slow-cooked).\n\nTo be specific : the \"off\" flavor is gamey-ness. Rank. Rancid. Kinda pewtrid. Overly pungent. Seamy.\n\n\u00a0Like, Feta cheese tastes great but goat cheese is (can be) gamey. Like leg-of-lamb is excellent but Mutton is (can be) rank and gamey/melodorous. Roast beef is tasty but (to me) Venison is rank.\n\n**Question :**\n\n**Does pressure-cooking change the flavor of proteins as slow-cooking does?**\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1g4i030/pressure_cooking_proteins/", "created_utc": 1729025241.0, "score": 2, "author": "MaxiePriest", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1g4i030/pressure_cooking_proteins/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

During my last 2 usages I've noticed that it takes around 30 minutes to build up the needed pressure/temperature while using 2 cups of rice and 2 cups of water (around 160-200 ml of water, so keep the ratio 1:1 or even slightly less water). I did clean the cover and it looks very clean after each cooking in general. I clean the rice from starch before cooking. During my first cookings I recall it took only 15-20 minute to build the pressure, but I didn't time in precisely just approximately.\n\nThe 9 minute of cooking just finished and the pot is very hot, BUT I am able to open the cover if I want and when I press the button to manually release pressure nothing happens. The questions are is it safe to open the lid and why no pressure escapes when I press the button?\n\nDuring my first couple of cookings there was always a lot of pressure left just after finishing cooking (counter passes 9 minutes and beeps). I mean I had to hold the button to release pressure for like full 10-15 seconds. Now I am worried that it seems like the locking mechanism doesn't work and the button to release the pressure also don't work. Or am I wrong in assuming this and the pressure cooker somehow releases the pressure from the safety valve without me hearing it in the other room?\n\nAfter writing this I just noticed the cooker was slightly colder on the top, so I opened it carefully and indeed there is barely any pressure left and the rice is cooked perfectly! :) I just don't understand why the major difference between my first couple of cookings and the last two, BUT I do recall I used more water during the first tries (around 1:1.5 ratio), so it should be related.

Let's say if the 6.5 liter sized pressure cooker requires 1 cup of water so would the larger 12.5 liter sized pressure cooker require 2 cups of water to cook that amount of chicken?\n\nSecond question:\n2. I understand 6.5 liter pressure cooker will build up or come to full pressure faster than larger 12.5 liter pressure cooker due pan volume and water amount.And release the pressure earlier than the larger sized pressure cooker.\n\n Question is approximately how much time  difference would I see between the 6.5 liter pressure cooker and 12.5 liter pressure cooker in building up of pressure and releasing of some of that pressure in the first whistle? \n\nLet's say for example the smaller 6.5 liter cooker builds up pressure and releases it in the first whistle in approximately 8 to 10 minutes.So how much time the 12.5 liter pressure cooker would take for build up pressure and releasing some of that in the first whistle? Approximately 13 to 15 minutes or longer like 17 to 20 minutes?\n\nQuestion 3. After building up of pressure and releasing of some of that pressure in the first whistle on both 6.5 liter pressure cooker and 12.5 liter cooker does the rest of cooking process of those 4 kg chicken take noticeably different amount of time?Or rest of the cooking process on both those pressure cookers roughly take more or less same amount of time without any noticeable  difference in time?\n\nQuestion 4. After the cooking is done does the natural release of pressure take longer for 12.5 liter cooker compared to 6.5 liter cooker?How much difference in time between these two above mentioned sized pressure cooker?Let's say 6.5 liter cooker takes more or less 15 minutes to naturally release  pressure after the flame is turned off.How long approximately it would take for 12.5 liter cooker to naturally release pressure after the flame is turned of?\n\nThank you for reading the wall of text.Please do share your experience in a reply or two.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1bg4fhq/so_a_couple_of_things_i_need_to_know_about/", "created_utc": 1710590297.0, "score": 3, "author": "Skeuomorph7", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1bg4fhq/so_a_couple_of_things_i_need_to_know_about/", "html_title": ""}

Originally I started with an 8L model, then I got a smaller one (2L?) for making rice.\n\nMy wife is Japanese and pressure cooked rice is her preference, especially for Haiga rice, which is a sort of hybrid brown/white rice. (Zojirushi makes a rice cooker that does pressure cooked rice, but it's not as fast as a 15 PSI pressure cooker and results are not as good, IMHO.)\n\nI used my pressure cooker for everything initially, but ideally they work best for meats, grains, and beans. For vegetables, other than root veggies, I found it too difficult to time tenderness consistently.\n\nFor the Kuhn Rikon pots I had to replace the main gaskets once or maybe twice, plus some of the plug gaskets in the lid which got hard. I used both, often daily.\n\nEventually both pots stopped sealing well when building pressure. Meaning, steam would escape and pressure would not build. Pulling on the spring often caused them to seal and build pressure. I'm guessing it was simply a gasket issue but they never worked consistently after replacing the gaskets.\n\nI also used an induction burner. I got one since the counter top burners have a timer which was useful for making rice. Eventually uneven heating expansion caused the bottom plates to warp and separate from the aluminum layers. Once the bottom plate warps it will eventually peel off, unfortunately.\n\nOnce I updated my kitchen range to induction range, I could no longer use either one pot. I tried buying two new steel plates but I had no way to reliably glue the plates in place. They would eventually separate.\n\nIf I bought a gas stove, not induction, I probably would keep them.\n\nKuhn Rikon did not offer any way to repair them. I had considered asking some local metal fabricators in Seattle if they could help but it just seems sensible to give both away. (If you want them, PM me, I want them to have a good home.)\n\nOther complaints: Yes they are initially very shiny and pretty. But unfortunately, they eventually will get greasy and dull. I've spent time scrubbing them but they go back to being dull. I also lost broke both lid caps, and replaced them both and they broke again.\n\nI also have an Insta-Pot and aluminum pot I got for camping\u2013was only like $25. The Insta-Pot works well enough but takes time to heat up and isn't as fast. Aluminum pots aren't easy to clean but I admire the simple design of it compared to the KR.\n\nI decided to go with Fissler/Vitaquick Premium pots, mainly since the bottom induction plate seems to be less likely to separate.

Or sometime's i'll use the air fry setting on the Foodi to air fry a side dish, so until that's done I can't pressure cook my main.\n\nI have multiple pots, but, everything basically gets backlogged as I tend to use the Ninja Foodi exclusively.

The Breville has a bean setting which is 20 mins natural release which I didn\u2019t the first natural release which seemed ok until I refrigerated them and realized they had broken down to much and I did a quick release which had the same results. \n\nNot sure how many bars of pressure the Cuisinart was using, it wasn\u2019t adjustable.

In a home made verde sauce.\n\nThen I mix the two, but it's time consuming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut i've recently bought some Instant Pot cookbooks (I own a Ninja Foodi) that have combined recipes, and wildly different cooking times. How can you cook rice and chicken together when they have different cooking times and liquid?\n\nFor example I have a Mexican Instant Pot cookbook for \"Arroz Con Pollo\" that says 1.5 lbs of chicken, 2 cups of white rice with only 1.5 cups of broth!  And it called for a 20 minute pressure cook and 10 min release! This was with long grain/basmati white rice. This wayyy less liquid and wayyy more cooking time than for rice itself. The recipe did say to use the \"Meat/Stew\" setting, which my Ninja doesn't have. But the internet tells me Meat/Stew is just a Instant Pot preset for a 35 minute pressure cook on High. How can rice cook for 20 minutes when by itself it turns out great at just 2 minutes?\n\nI have an Indian cookbook for a chicken biryani with basmati rice that has a 1:1 rice ratio (as opposed to 1:1.25 for Ninja Foodi's standard white rice cooking guidelines). And it calls for a 6 minute pressure cook with 5 minute natural release. Again, higher than what's called for rice alone, less than what's called for chicken. Is it because of the lower natural relase time (5 min vs 10)\n\nI just want to get to the point where I can cook myself. But now i'm confused as I see recipes with meat+grain dishes having wildly different recipes, I don't want my rice to be overcooked/undercooked/burnt/soggy. Or my meat to be undercooked/well done. And if I want to not follow a cookbook, how do I determine the water and cooking times for 1 pot recipes on my own?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/17x02xw/cooking_times_for_1_pot_rice_meat_dishes/", "created_utc": 1700175407.0, "score": 6, "author": "xagent003", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/17x02xw/cooking_times_for_1_pot_rice_meat_dishes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Ofcourse making it quick has it's negative impact on the result but i am still looking for ideas to improve taste while keeping the cooking time the same. \n\nMy regular recipe goes something like this;\nBrown large cubes, in batches if necessary.\nSweat some onion and garlic.\nToss all meat back in.\nAdd in spices - usually salt, pepper, cumin and garlic powder.\nAdd in some tomato paste (sometimes tomato-red pepper paste mix)\nAdd in hot water.\nHigh pressure 1 hour 40mins - rapid release.\n\nOne goal I have to keep is also meat should end up super soft, like if almost dissolves to touch. My wife can only tolerate eating red meat like that.\n\nSo, what are your suggestions to improve the taste without ending up tougher meat or longer cook time?\n\nI'm thinking a quick brine, like 10mins, in salt water.

{"title": "Pot Roast coming out tough", "selftext": "For reference, I have a Crockpot brand pressure cooker. I'm not super sure what model though.\n\nSo, I've got a pot roast that I used to make fairly regularly. I used to make it in a slow cooker for 8 hours but switched it to 30 minutes in the pressure cooker and never had issues in the past. It'd always shred up nice and easily. I've recently got the pressure cooker out again though and suddenly it seems like everything comes out tough and impossible to shred.  I'm not sure what may have changed in the pot itself cause I haven't changed my settings or timing at all. Hell, I'm not even sure if it's over or undercooking since google seems to have conflicting info on what leads to a tough roast.\n\nIs there anything I can do to try and fix this going forward? I'd certainly prefer not having to go back to having to prep my dinner in the morning. Thanks for any help y'all can provide!\n\nEdit: Thanks y'all! Consensus seems to be that I'm just not cooking long enough.

{"title": "Impressions of Zavor Duo and Fissler Vitaquick (small review)", "selftext": "Splitting up with your partner after 11 years involves a lot of pain, and one of those pains is that I am losing my old, trusty, pressure-cookers(a 6 quart Presto, my favorite, and a 6 quart Lagostina). But, I decided to turn this into an opportunity to maybe upgrade.  So, I settled on a budget and went hunting.  I ended up getting a Fissler Vitaquick 6 quarts and Zavor Duo 8 quarts(much cheaper than the fissler 8 ).  I was also eyeing the Presto 8 quarts(stainless steel version), but I prefer to have an handle, so I decided to give Zavor a try instead.   Here is a quick review of both.\n\nAs a small backgroud, I've cooked with pressure-cookers ever since I left home 30 years ago.  And before that, my mother used them extensively to save cooking time (raised on a farm where time is precious)  I also tried using multipurpose electric pressure cooker, but simply never really liked those and I am using exclusively stovetop units now.\n\nFirst, the Zavor.  When it arrived, I had some bones ready to make beef broth, so I was able to quickly test it.  First thing I noticed when I got it out of the box is the weight.  It was insanely light for the size.  I admit this did not sit well with me.  The bottom was not as thick as I would have liked, and the sides appeared real thin too, having almost a crystal ring to it when I hit it with my nail. The silicone ring seemed a tad too small for the top too, and didn\u2019t look as solid as what I was used with Presto.   But hey, as long as it cook nicely, right?  So, I cleaned it, made sure everything was in working order(using the manual as reference) and was about to start making the broth when I noticed something\u2026 The manual stated 18/10 stainless steel, just like the store website, but the box said: 18/8.  Uh?  So I wrote to Zavor to verify.  I then proceeded to make the broth.  Well, my enthusiasm died as quickly as the pressure rose.  There are lot of things I instantly disliked about this unit.  First, while the pressure build, there is a lot of water dripping from the handle, and some steam comes out on all side while the ring expand in its spot.  Second, when it reached the right pressure, the \u201cexhaust\u201d is on the side of the cover, and it send the steam downward.  The problem?  If you use the right side element of your oven, you are about 100% sure the steam will get directly on your countertop!!!  Third, that thing was dripping water from the left side too.  I stopped everything, made sure the ring was positioned ok(it was), I removed the handle and made sure all was tight (it was) and restarted the process.  Same result, water dripping by the handle, and once pressure was reached, additional dripping on the left side.  Looking online, I saw I was not the only one with that problem.   Plus, the handle still wiggled a bit left to right when the steam is at 15 psi.  That wasn\u2019t reassuring, I am used to handles locking completely when the pressure is reached.  Keeping the steam at the right level was on par with what I was used to with my Presto, meaning I could lower the temp to mid-level, but not more.   I made the broth, but I was disenchanted at the functionality of the device.  Having to constantly wipe the excess water dripping on the heating surface, and making sure the outgoing steam doesn\u2019t touch the counter, is no fun.  A day later, the final nail in the coffin arrived when Zavor confirmed their \u201cnew\u201d factory, in China,  only made 18/8 stainless steel and they were in the process of updating the documentation.  Call it what you want, that\u2019s false advertisement, period.  I contacted the store who was very surprised at the change in stainless steel quality, and promptly told me to return the unit and that I would get a full refund, which I did.  Zavor is out.  Forever.  In that price range, I would select Presto(stainless steel version) or T-Fal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to the Fissler 6 quarts, which arrived a few days later.  Taking it out of the box immediately felt good.  A good weight, but still easily used with one hand only.  A thick base, and sides that doesn\u2019t sound like crystal.  The sealing ring is also very thick and looks like it will last a long time.  And man does everything simply feel solid.  I decided to make rice for a quick test that evening, since that is a very good indicator if a base is thick enough(when too thin, the rice will stick or burn at the bottom).  Both my presto and Lagostina had some trouble with rice, especially the lagostina.  The unit is so silent that I was stunned when I saw the pressure level rise to the second bar, indicating the pressure was now at 15 psi.  I am so used to seeing more steam come out when it reach the right pressure!  After 3 minutes I cut the heat and let it depressurize over 10 minutes.  Well, the rice was puuurrrfect!  My oldest even commented on how it was \u201cjust right\u201d.  Not a single grain burned or stuck at the bottom.  I was impressed!  The next days I tried it again to make a beef stew, to test how it goes over a longer period.  Again, it reached 15 psi in complete silence, and once it reached 2 bars I had to lower the heat to the lowest setting!  I was able to forget about it for the next 25 mins without worries.  That means the base is really good at keeping the temperature stable.  After that 25 mins, I depressurised manually. This was easily done with the handle, but I admit having it comes out in a \u201cV\u201d shape makes for some gymnastic to make sure the steam doesn\u2019t go on a surface it shouldn\u2019t.  Then added the vegetables for another 5 mins at high pressure.  The stew was perfect.  Meat was melting in the mouth, and the vegetables had that nice beef broth taste.   I love \u201calmost\u201d everything about that unit.  It is sturdy, the cover locks perfectly, manual steam release is easy, no chance of burning yourself when doing so, no wiggling on the handle, the extra steam comes out on top while cooking(when it comes out, because, as mentioned, there are barely any coming out at all!!). Cleaning was super easy.  The only downside?  The 6 quarts base could be a tad wider IMHO, to help with browning more meat.\n\nI so loved this unit that I simply decided to get the 8 quarts version too to replace the Zavor, even though it busted the budget I had planned for the pressure cookers.(luckily, I managed to get both size on sale on Fissler website, so it wasn\u2019t so bad in the end)  After 3 weeks, I haven\u2019t a single regret.  They are a joy to use and the food comes out perfectly cooked and extra tasty every time.  And with the 8 quarts, I can now buy any chicken size without having to worry if it will fit or not.\n\nNow, if I ever get married again, I\u2019m making sure to have a contract signed that I keep both of these cookers if things goes south in the future :P", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1094k5b/impressions_of_zavor_duo_and_fissler_vitaquick/", "created_utc": 1673443296.0, "score": 20, "author": "kinwolf", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1094k5b/impressions_of_zavor_duo_and_fissler_vitaquick/", "html_title": ""}

So I'm also looking for advice to make it taste better.\n\nHere's the recipe that I'm using:\n\n* 2 cups of white long grain rice\n* 2 1/2 cups of beef broth\n* Soy sauce (I usually eyeball it, but its around 1tbs)\n* Beef (I usually get a raw steak from the grocery store, cut in in small cubes of maybe 1in x 0.5in)\n* \\~325g of mixed Vegetables (I usually buy a pack of frozen vegetables and use half of it, which comes out to about 325g)\n* A bit of salt and pepper\n\nThen I just put all of that in the pressure cooker, and set it for 17 minutes (I don't remember why 17 minutes, I just remember that's what I used to do two years ago, when I first got my pressure cooker). This usually gives me 2 or 3 meals, even if it tastes a bit bland. That's why I'm looking for advice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/zqgxgz/looking_for_tips_and_recipe_recomendation_on_how/", "created_utc": 1671518196.0, "score": 18, "author": "Registeel1234", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/zqgxgz/looking_for_tips_and_recipe_recomendation_on_how/", "html_title": ""}

I have read that pressure cooker works(part on pressure) by  creating steam.   \n\n2. This helps to raise the boiling temperature of water  \n\n3. Pressure cookers also have a steam function, but i do believe its a seperate setting from pressure cooking.   \nSo can I \"pressure steam\" with less liquid?  \n\n\nPouring away the liquid seems wasteful to me, can't serve or reuse most of them(at least i don't have any idea) as none of them likes it, unfortunately. Am wondering if reducing the amount of liquid would work or would it burn? Also maybe putting the cut in a steamer basket?  \n\n\nI would welcome other solutions too!

I cut the old stewing hen into pieces because I aim for gelatinous broth, thats most important to me.\n\nThen I cover the chicken with water, just an inch above the chicken. The water to chicken ratio is always 1.5 parts (max 2) of water for every 1 part of chicken and I typically finish up with about as much finished stock as water I added in the beginning, minus a bit for evaporation. Then I bring everything to a boil, reduce the heat and let it pressure cook for 75 minutes. After 75 Minutes \"quick\" pressure release. The stock is always very rich and gelatinous, always! I always use the same chickens, same chicken to water ratio etc.\n\nNow I tried several chickens in the instant pot and I'm very disappointed because the stock is not gelatinous at all, very thin and I end up with more liquid then I start with. In my pressure cooker it\u00b4s always less stock like I mentioned.\n\nI tried:\n\n\\-high pressure, 75 minutes, keep warm, quick release after 10 minutes = like water\n\n\\-high pressure, 75 minutes, keep warm, natural release 58 minutes until the vent drops = watery but the \"thickest\" one\n\n\\-high pressure, 60 minutes, natural release 46 minutes until the vent drops = like water\n\n\\-high pressure, 90 minutes, natural release 48 minutes until the vent drops = like water\n\n**What am I doing wrong?**\n\nI am very desperate and frustrated...\n\nI appreciate every tipp, help and suggestion.\n\nI\u00b4m also willing to pay for advice, in advance of course!!!

Some of these questions might sound stupid but im just making sure of what i know.  All I've really done so far is pressure cook some chicken breasts (boneless).  I'm hesitant to go further until i get some questions answered.\n\nFirst stupid question....there always needs to be some water in the pot correct?  I can't rely on the moisture in the chicken or beef right? (I know the answer is likely yes just establishing that fact)\n\nfor stews or tomato sauce based sauces how do you end up with a thicker broth at the end of the cooking?  for instance if i wanted to make chicken breasts in spagetti sauce am i only cooking the chicken by itself, removing the water, adding the sauce, then switching to a slow cook?  (Similarly for beef stew..).   Or would i just add the tomato sauce but add extra water and maybe have to boil out the remainder of the water before serving?\n\nto adjust my recipe, if a chicken breast comes out less tender than i want, is that a result of too little water, too much water, or just too long a pressure cook?  \n\nIf i wanted to make a  Bolognese sauce , would i want to pressure cook at all?  would this just be done better in a slow cooker / stove top?  \n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/uwu1vy/newbie_questions/", "created_utc": 1653407708.0, "score": 11, "author": "ShodanW", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/uwu1vy/newbie_questions/", "html_title": ""}
