A month-long series of legal battles led to the highly controversial 5\u20134 Supreme Court decision Bush v. Gore, which ended the recount.  \n  \nThe recount having been ended, Bush won Florida by 537 votes, a margin of 0.009%. The Florida recount and subsequent litigation resulted in major post-election controversy, and various people and organizations have speculated about who would have won the election in various scenarios. Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes, one more than a majority, despite Gore receiving 543,895 more votes (a margin of 0.51% of all votes cast). Bush won 11 states that voted Democratic in the 1996 election: Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. As of 2020, this remains the last presidential election in which a Republican won New Hampshire.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nHowever this probably isn't the oddest. Samuel J. Tilden of New York outpolled Ohio's Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in the popular vote, with Tilden winning 4,288,546 votes and Hayes winning 4,034,311. Tilden was, and remains, the only candidate in American history who lost a presidential election despite receiving a majority (not just a plurality) of the popular vote.  \n  \nAfter a first count of votes, Tilden won 184 electoral votes to Hayes' 165, with 20 votes unresolved. These 20 electoral votes were in dispute in four states: in the case of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, each party reported its candidate had won the state, while in Oregon one elector was declared illegal (as an \"elected or appointed official\") and replaced. The question of who should have been awarded these electoral votes is at the heart of the ongoing debate about the election of 1876.\n\nThe Electoral Commission was formed on January 29, 1877, to debate about the 20 electoral votes that were in dispute. At the beginning of March, an informal deal was struck to resolve the dispute: the Compromise of 1877, which awarded all 20 of the disputed electoral votes to Hayes.

Whether it is from the trunk of the tree, or the lawn of the grass, or the way there is a striking contrast between the darkened and lit area of the building in the background. The contrast of the light really shows the observer how light can depict depth. In an average photo with such a complex subject(s) one may know that the subject has depth, but in YOUR photo, it is gently told to the person who is lucky enough to look upon this sight. Aside from lighting, I absolutely love the fact that the type of bread used is circular. The fact that you use a shape that is almost never seen in a perfect form in nature is an artistic statement to, again, contrast the natural look of the subject. It truly shows how much of can be illustrated with simple tools: a tree, a camera, and some sort of bread. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your contribution to this community, and to art as a whole.", "I want to see the reaction of someone who has no idea what this is and stumbles across it in the real world", "This is a waste of bread."]}

{"title": "Regarding this sub accepting Twitter posts: Our official stance is FUCK NAZI SCUM.", "selftext": "So due to the subject matter of this sub we have really never had to deal with Twitter posts.  However, I feel that we need to take a public stand regarding [the actions of Elmo on Monday afternoon](https://imgur.com/gallery/elon-sieg-heil-mirror-OLwJ3Jm).\n  \nTherefore in order to do so, this sub will officially not accept any Twitter posts.  And it will also not accept any X posts.\n  \nAnd here is a thing: anyone who wants to test this theory in this sub will be perma-banned with no warning.  If you see a Twitter or X sourced post here, PLEASE REPORT IT MULTIPLE TIMES.\n  \nCall it 'censorship' if you want to.  I prefer to use the term 'keeping the sub clear of scum'.  We have had literal Nazis post here in the past, and I was all too happy to remove them for good.  I will be overjoyed to do it again.\n  \nNow go out and staple bread to a tree and [tell a Nazi to fuck off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYKAQZUAbHU).\n  \n--------\n  \n**UPDATE:**\n  \nIt has been pointed out that this is something of a strange place to be talking about politics.  No shit.  I am 100% in no  way whatsoever thinking that this ban on Twitter/X posts will have any measurable effect on the situation of the world.\n  \nIt has also been suggested that I personally am doing this to reap Reddit karma.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have a combined total of over 800,000 Comment and Post karma to date.  That is not the flex you may be thinking it is.  Reddit karma is worthless.  The only thing that it has ever gotten me directly is an invite to those Uber Secret Top Level subreddits dedicated to high karma types.  And trust me, those subs are *rife* with circle jerking.  But I digress.\n  \nBut it is A Good Thing to call out evil where it exists.  Can this sub call out all evil?  Of course not.  But we can call out the evil that we see.  And if more people every day call out the evil that they see, maybe something will be done about it.  Maybe.  And when the last Nazi is thrown into a ditch, someone somewhere will say 'Thank God for BreadStapledToTrees for telling me about how bad Nazis are'.  And if you think I am serious about that statement then maybe this whole internet thing just isn't for you.\n  \nIf you disagree with our attitude about Elmo's little rant on TV the other night, fine.  You are free to talk about it.  But not in this sub.  And yes that might feel a little disingenuous or unfair.  And you would be correct in a way.  Because mods are free to make rules that 5% of the users do not like.   Or 50% of the users.  Or yes, even 100% of the users.  Because anyone who does not like that rule is more than free to go start their own sub with blackjack, hookers, and rules that **they** like.\n  \nSo to anyone reading this that thinks that was not a Nazi salute in any way at all, either post some bread stapled to a tree, or go blab about your interesting political views somewhere else.  Or go start /r/IAmALittleNaziBitch and post all about how BreadStapledToTrees mods said mean things that made you cry.  I am sure that the crowd you hang out with will commiserate with you.  Either way, this is not a sub to discuss the finer points of identifying a Seig Heil salute.  Mods here are a simple bunch, they call shit as they see it.\n\nAlso, and in closing, please go post some Bread Stapled To A Tree.  Because in these trying times, a little harmless chaotic good is what people need to help them get through all the shit.\n  \n-----------------\n  \nANOTHER UPDATE: Locking this thread because some people are asswipes.

I am very impressed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow onto the tree-bread artwork. I think you balanced the photo very well. There is no part of the photo that is too mundane nor too vibrant and distracts from the \"goods\" in the photo. One of the major things that is important in a picture of this nature must include balance in color vibrance, no overexposed areas, and most importantly a good correlation between the tree and the slice of bread. There is not a single part of this image is overexposed, and having such a long photo, it is often difficult to keep the entire frame balanced. And onto the correlation of tree to slice, you did an amazing job. The complex nature of the tree and the plain features of the bread itself work wonderfully. Overall this piece is wonderful, it has a nice \"homey\" feel to it with the brick house with the car in the drive way.

And then there's the mirroring of the wheel arch and the top of the bread, and the camera position makes them exactly the same size.  There's a superficial air of casual randomness to this staple, but it's underpinned by meticulous geometric planning.  Layer upon layer upon layer.  Well done!

When I was done preparing I decided to take a quick look around and just go for it. Suddenly, 2 people came walking around a corner approximately 100 meters from me. They seemed to be a couple that just did their shopping, judging by the bags they were carrying. \n\nI decided to finish the job quickly and take a photo. My stapler has a lot of power though, so it makes a lot of noise. This noise seemed to alarm the couple. I walked away quickly so that they would not be able to see my face.\nThat\u2019s when they yelled at me: \u2018Hey... HEY!\u2019 At this point they were standing next to the tree I had just stapled.\n\nThe couple went the same direction I went, but I didn\u2019t think anything of it at first. I decided to take a few weird turns, just to be sure, but they were still right behind me. At this point I knew pretty much for sure they were following me, because if they wanted to go where I was headed they could have taken a much shorter route. \n\nOnce I got behind another corner I just started running until I thought they wouldn\u2019t be able to spot me anymore after turning the corner and maybe having 1 or 2 lucky guesses of where I went.\n\nIt worked, so I decided to head home cautiously. It was quite tense in the moment but definitely a fun experience!", "Op pls expand on the \u201cI got chased\u201d part, I am very interested.", "\\>inb4 the local population starts recounting the tale of witnessing you at night and it devolves into a vampire/criptid story in a few months", "I thought this was carved into the tree and I was about to be angry", "I immediately noticed this is in the netherlands", "I think this one is really tasteful there\u2019s really a lot of thought that went into it 10/10", "Tell me more", "Please, enlighten us with the story of the chase!", "This is so abnormally ominous", "Utrecht?", "Lmao geert is dis u?", "[deleted]", "read the rules moron", "Permanently scaring a beautiful tree for a stupid meme...

Do not endanger your body to get an 'awesome' pic. Pics look less 'awesome' viewed from a hospital bed.\n11. No virtual posts (Minecraft, Art, AI etc.).  Mods are dull witted and eschew such things as Art and the like.\n12. No memes.  If you do not know what a meme is, then just eat bread, staple paper, and watch trees grow.\n13. No reposts. There's a minimal level of effort to make a legit post. Don't steal karma from fellow Redditors.\n14. Don't be a **CRUSTFACE**.  A Crustface is what we like to call people who act like an *asshat*.\n15. PLEASE report rules violations!  Mods will love you for it (but not in *that way* so don't get your hopes up).\n16. Post bread stapled to trees!  Impress your friends!  Confuse your enemies!  Win *valuable* Reddit Karma!  \n17. Use this post to suggest extra rules that are not yet in force.  This is that one secret trick that Mods LOVE!\n18. Use this post to suggest additions to the Acceptable Bread List.  This is that other secret trick that Mods LOVE!\n19. Mods may approve a post that does not follow the rules.  Mods are a fickle bunch.\n20. Don't abuse Rule #19. A cool original post can fast become a lame tired meme if applied ten thousand times.  \n21. Do not staple plastic bags of bread to trees.  Plastic won't degrade for over 10,000 years.\n22. This is Rule #22.  Any mention of Rule #22 will earn you a three day **BAN**.  Test me in this, I **swear**!\n23. No *bitching* if your post gets removed.  Mods get nervous when people bitch and their *Ban Finger* gets all twitchy and shit.  Just sayin'\n24. Don't forget Rule #24\n25. No camel under the age of 12 years is allowed to carry more than 500 pounds for longer than 15 miles unless there is an immediate threat to life or limb.\n  \nRead, understand, and heed these rules for fun and profit!  \n  \nWelcome friend; may your stapler never run dry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadStapledToTrees/comments/ukehvy/these_are_the_sub_rules_please_read_them_before/", "created_utc": 1651933795.0, "score": 2315, "author": "99999999999999999989", "num_comments": 697, "permalink": "/r/BreadStapledToTrees/comments/ukehvy/these_are_the_sub_rules_please_read_them_before/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["The Acceptable Bread List:\n--------------------------------\n* Angel Food Cake (thanks to [/u/RiversOfThought](https://old.reddit.com/r/BreadStapledToTrees/comments/11ieugq/guys_this_ones_big_angel_food_cake_on_king_palm/))\n* Arepa\n* Bagels\n* Baguettes\n* B\u00e1nh m\u00ec\n* Baozi\n* Barbari bread\n* Bear Claws\n* Beignets\n* Bhakri\n* Bhatura\n* Biscuits\n* Blimpie rolls\n* Bolillo\n* Bread (duh)\n* Bread bowls\n* Breadsticks\n* Brioche\n* Cake\n* Challah\n* Chapati\n* Chicharron (Wheat Snack)\n* Churros\n* Cinnamon rolls\n* Conchas\n* Cookies\n* Cornbread\n* Cosmo rolls\n* Crackers\n* Cream of Wheat (YES but it has to support its own weight)\n* Creampuffs\n* Crepes\n* Croissants\n* Cronuts\n* Croutons\n* Crullers\n* Crumpets\n* Crust\n* Cupcakes\n* Dagobert rolls\n* Dagwood rolls\n* Danish\n* Doughnuts\n* Dumplings\n* Eclairs\n* Elephant ears\n* English Muffins\n* Fairy Bread\n* Flapcakes\n* Flapjacks\n* Fritters\n* Fruitcake\n* Fry bread\n* Funnel Cake\n* Gatsby rolls\n* Griddlecakes\n* Grinder rolls\n* Hamantash\n* Hamburger buns\n* Hardtack\n* Hero rolls\n* Hoagie rolls\n* Hoecakes\n* Hot Cross Buns\n* Hot dog buns\n* Hotcakes\n* Hush Puppies\n* Italian rolls\n* Kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d\n* Kouign-amann\n* Krumpets\n* Kulcha\n* Lavash\n* Long Johns\n* Matzo\n* Malasada\n* Mochi\n* Naan\n* Non-English Muffins\n* Orahnja\u010da\n* Pancakes\n* Panettonne\n* Paratha\n* Pasta\n* Pastry\n* Pie crust\n* Pita\n* Pizza\n* Po' Boy rolls\n* Polenta (YES but it has to support its own weight)\n* Pop-tarts\n* Potato Scones\n* Povitica\n* Pretzels\n* Profiterole\n* P\u00e2te \u00e0 choux\n* Rice cakes\n* Rieska\n* Rocket rolls\n* Rolls\n* Roti\n* Ruisreik\u00e4leip\u00e4\n* Samoon\n* Sangak\n* Scones\n* Seitan \n* Shaobing\n* Sheermal\n* Smoske rolls\n* Somun\n* Sourdough\n* Sourdough Starter\n* Spritzkuchen\n* Spukie rolls\n* Stottie\n* Strucia\n* Sub rolls\n* Sweet rolls\n* Taco shells\n* Taftan\n* Tarts\n* Teacakes\n* Tippaleip\u00e4\n* Toast\n* Toaster strudel\n* Torpedo rolls\n* Tortillas\n* Turnovers\n* Twinkies\n* Waffles\n* Wedge rolls\n* Yeast rolls\n* Youtiao\n* Zeppelin rolls\n* Zwieback toast  \n  \nMore to come!\n  \nEDIT TO ADD: Hey I **love** that we are adding all these cool and unusual bread options.

I waited a while to post this for the heat to die down. The HOA president was being a dick to everyone in the community, especially me and my roommates because we rent. The dude was corrupt to begin with, contracting all jobs for the community through his companies, then taking his sweet sweet time actually getting the job complete. He would also do things like get on the roof to look down at our balcony and then give us infractions for having a rug (to cover up some of the bad boards that the HOA says they will replace, but has yet to) and string lights on it. Essentially he was power tripping hard core and wouldn't even let us do things that were non-disruptive, and aesthetically pleasing. I have no say in this community's HOA, but I had to do something about this megalomaniac. \n\nSo I began systematically stapling bread to the tree outside of his apartment unit over the course of a few weeks. The goal was to get him to post about it publicly to the community and make a fool of himself. The tree pictured is the third and last tree I did this to. I was like a bread stapling ninja. I had a divine mission given to me from the bird gods to make this man a fool. I operated at cover of night, wearing a face mask incase he put up surveillance after the first \"stapling\". I moved like the wind as I put more yeast on wood than a 20 year old mid western stripper. \n\nOn my first run, he removed all the bread that same morning. The second time, he waited a few days to have the time necessary to clean the stale bread that clung to his tree. After my third go at this activity, my efforts payed dividends. Once he realized the bread won't stop, he left it up there for all to see, and they saw. The HOA president posted to the community that he legitimately filed a police report against the stapler.... Now I didn't see the cops come by, but I can assure you that they took this matter VERRRRRrrrrryyyy seriously. That summer, I would sit by the pool and listen as the people at my complex speculated on who could have put the bread on the tree. All I would offer to this conversation is that \"the person clearly had a purpose. The HOA guy is a jerk to his community, and didn't get anything done with the HOA fees we pay\". The bread tree got the community thinking about their HOA overlord. They quickly realized that he was power tripping and in this community only for himself. \n\nHe has since stepped down from the HOA, and sold his house. Is his move caused from HOA fallout and community shame? Who can say for sure. But what I can say is that ideas are powerful. Sometimes something as meaningless as bread stapled to a tree can cause ripples throughout peoples lives. Be careful with your words, care for your fellow humans, or one day you just might find yourself at the end of a stapler.\n\n[More of my escapade](https://imgur.com/a/7qxPljA):", "\"The police have been called\"\n\nAnd what do they expect the police to do?

{"title": "Rules clarification - Cactus", "selftext": "So we here at Bread Stapled to Trees are a fairly liberal group of folk.  We consider a lot of grain based food products as bread when in fact, most of the free world would not.  I do not know how the Hard Line Communist Bloc defines bread, so I cannot speak to that with any sort of accuracy.\n  \nHowever, as someone who has lived in Phoenix, AZ for seven years, I can state that the Saguaro holds a special place in my heart.  Any Saguaro that has branches on it is *at a minimum* fifty years old.  The great big ones you see in most photos are over *three hundred years* old.  They are an endangered and protected species as well.  Also, cacti do not have a thick bark to protect them from staples and thus could be damaged by one.  And yes they have spines that could easily hold a bread, but then there would be no staple.\n  \nGoing forward, Saguaro, and in fact all cacti will fall into the rule about bonsai, young trees, and stapling too many breads to a single tree.  In each case, the tree can be actually harmed and the submission will be removed.\n  \nPlease make use of the Report function to alert mods to any infractions.\n  \nThank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadStapledToTrees/comments/sh2867/rules_clarification_cactus/", "created_utc": 1643638534.0, "score": 2032, "author": "99999999999999999989", "num_comments": 65, "permalink": "/r/BreadStapledToTrees/comments/sh2867/rules_clarification_cactus/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["My love for the sub just grew 3 sizes.

This work is a bold commentary on the ephemeral nature of sustenance and the human imposition on natural landscapes, encapsulating themes of transience and permanence. By juxtaposing the mundane with the organic, the artist invites viewers to reflect on the absurdity and profundity of human impact on the environment. The choice of such an everyday object as white bread, symbolizing both nourishment and the artificiality of modern life, nailed to a tree, a symbol of life and nature, creates a powerful, thought-provoking piece that resonates deeply with contemporary concerns about sustainability and ecological consciousness. This forward-thinking integration of conceptual art and environmental critique cements the artist's status as a pioneering figure ahead of their time.", "Where staple", "Good, good...  More of this...", "In the over-saturated realm of contemporary art, \"White bread\" exemplifies the kind of pretentious, shallow provocation that has become all too common. This piece, featuring a slice of white bread stapled to a tree, embodies the worst excesses of modern artistic expression, substituting genuine insight for empty symbolism.\n\nThe stark contrast between the bread and the tree is superficial at best, offering little more than a trite commentary on nature versus industrialization. The staple, intended to symbolize humanity's invasive presence, feels like an overused metaphor, lacking originality or depth. It fails to evoke any real emotional or intellectual response, instead coming across as a half-hearted attempt at environmental commentary.\n\nThe choice of materials seems more about shock value than meaningful engagement. The white bread, emblematic of mass production, does not convey the intended critique of modern agricultural practices. Instead, it appears as an unimaginative and lazy prop, its symbolism obvious and unchallenging. The tree, reduced to a mere background object, deserves more than to be a canvas for such banal experimentation.\n\nMoreover, the piece's execution lacks finesse. The staple\u2019s crude insertion into the tree feels more like vandalism than art, suggesting a disregard for both the natural world and the viewer\u2019s intelligence. It fails to provoke thought or discussion, offering no new perspectives or insights.\n\nUltimately, \"White bread\" exemplifies the pitfalls of contemporary art\u2019s obsession with being edgy and provocative at the expense of substance. It is a superficial, unimaginative work that confuses shock value with significance, leaving the viewer not enlightened, but rather disappointed by the lack of genuine artistic merit.", "This reminds me of a Rothko painting.

{"title": "Just what is the Mod Team actually doing?", "selftext": "~~So the three days came and went.  The thing is that several events took place that changed the playing field.~~\n  \n~~Reddit actually went in and removed all Mods from several high traffic subs that had switched to NSFW.  The mods were following the rules.  They listened to the will of the users and removed posting rules.  As such, they marked the subs NSFW because they knew what was going to happen.  But Admins decided that the advertising clicks were more important.  So they removed the mods, locked down the subs, and deleted posts that were critical to spez.~~\n  \n~~Then in a an announcement, they said that they don't mind certain levels of 'approved protest' but that marking a sub as NSFW when it was not before warrants their actions.  'Approved protest' is a conflict of terms.  It reminds me of the term 'alternative facts'.~~\n  \n~~So an 'approved protest' such as the John Oliver posts actually help Reddit.  Because they are funny.  And funny means clicks and eyeballs on ads.  Sure the user who joined the sub won't be getting the content they originally came for, but really who cares about that?  It is the ad clicks that make a difference.  THAT is why Admins went nuclear.  Because several default subs went NSFW which means no ad revenue.~~\n  \n~~Right now, I am not sure what happens.  I just didn't want to leave you guys in the dark any longer than I already have.  And I cannot speak for the other mods.  I invite them to share their thoughts in this post.  And you guys as well.  Please.  Let's talk about it.  Tell the mods what you think about BSTT in this thread.  And we'll take what you say seriously.~~\n  \nWe are back open.  /u/spez and the Admins do not care.

So, from the lichen growing on the tree, I think it's safe to assume this is in the northern hemisphere, as lichen enjoys cold climates. Additionally, the leaf shape and generally flat bark give away that this tree is deciduous, but not an American basswood, as the bark is nowhere near rough enough. Looking at the leaf shape, I can see that they don't have the characteristic ridges of beech trees, which rules those out completely.\n\nMoving on to a more refined approach, I attempted to identify the trees behind it. The bright red berries immediately made me think of Hawthorn trees, which supported my hypothesis that this is in relatively far north, likely near the east cost, but with good soil, guessing Ohio, Michigan, or Indiana. Though it's also possible that this could be in Britain, the white bread makes me doubt that slightly, but not enough to take it off the table.\n\nFurther refining my search based on this area, checking leaf shapes and cross comparing them, identifying trees that grow near Hawthorns, the tree that best matches leaf shape, bark smoothness, thickness of stump, and location (mostly along the northern hemisphere, though growing in a band, found all along the canadian-american border, and following that lat. line) it could only be a Goat Willow tree!\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong OP.", "what a masterpiece", "Can confirm that is bread.", "Classic.

The fact that this subreddit is called \"breadstapledtotrees\" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against non-bread-stapled-to-trees, I just hate their association with a breadstapledtotrees subreddit. Stapling potatoes to a tree?

Want to personalize your bread-stapled-to-trees? Use an uncommon, photogenic tree or use sourdough or french bread.

I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a botanical expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to bread-stapled-to-trees and trees-stapled-to-bread. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our bread-stapled-to-trees and stop associating your non-bread-stapled-to-trees with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this.

It is a story of adversity, oppression, and pure human spirit.\n\n\\*\\*The Story\\*\\*: The bread revolt of 1492 happened as a direct result of civil unrest. At the time there was a severe economic crisis and tax oppression happening. Obviously there was a public outcry. In order to quell the population, the local government sought out and executed the people who were vocal about these issues.\n\nLegend has it that the government captured one of the local leaders who was speaking up and executed him. In a horrifying turn of events, they ground his bones to dust and turned it into bread. In a brutal display of power, this bread was then stapled to a tree in the center of the town where the man was captured. This, however, did not quiet the population. It did quite the opposite. It did nothing but spark rage and fury in the townsfolk.\n\nThe townsfolk, enraged, took bread from their own pantries, and in an amazing display of solidarity, stapled it to every tree in the town until they ran out of bread. They then went on to storm, loot, and destroy two castles. Inside each castle, the townsfolk put to justice several of their oppressors. Outside of each castle, the townsfolk paraded with banners that had bread as the emblem. (The Wikipedia page has an image of what it looked like.)\n\nAlbert the 3, Duke of Saxony was responsible for ending the revolt. He activated military forces which promptly swarmed the area and started killing peasants involved. Historians estimate 200 peasants were killed.\n\nSo yes, stapling bread to trees is always a fun thing to do. We've all done it. But we must never forget that we are all human, and must stick up for one another in the face of any and all adversity.\n\n\\*\\*Variation\\*\\*: There is, in fact, a lesser believed variation to this legend. It is that the peasants used nails instead of staples. As of now, there is no such verification as to which is true. However, the staple variation is more than two hundred times as believed then the nail variation.\n\nI choose to have fun and display solidarity by using staples. While it is The most believed version of the legend, I have another reason for using staples. The main reason is that while compared to nails, staples cause minimal ecological damage. With a staple, only the bark is damaged. With a nail, the inside of the tree is damaged and possibly poisoned. This has a longer-lasting impact on the tree.\n\nBut please, I implore you. Do not fight with the people who use nails. Try to make them aware of the ecological damage, but do not sour our relationship with them. They are both great ways to have fun. Imagine what a joke it would be if a symbol of solidarity is what led to thousands of people being at each other's throats.\n\n\\*\\*Credit\\*\\*: Partial credit goes to u/IncredibleNyan1. When I originally asked why people staple bread to trees, IncredibleNyan1 responded, \"back in the ol' bread war of 1492, they turned a guy into bread and stapled him to a tree as punishment.\" It was this response that piqued my curiosity and led to my investigation of this occurrence in modern culture.\n\nMost of this story is but a legend. The only reliable sources of proof are as stated: A Manual of Dates created by George H. Townsend in 1867. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia created by the USSR in 1978. An engraving of the castle being stormed created by Simon Fokke in 1750. All of which were created centuries after the incident. By the time of these publications, the incident had already turned into local legend. It is this legend that I have recited today.\n\nEdit: To see Simon Fokke's image of the incident, and to get the verified facts in a digestible manner, see[ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread\\_and\\_Cheese\\_Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_Cheese_Revolt)", "Thank you for the backstory, I learned a lot. But I also have to say that the picture you took is really good.  An unconventional heel piece, but a nice staple with hardly any indent.  The tree is also a nice one.", "Huh, learned something today"]}
