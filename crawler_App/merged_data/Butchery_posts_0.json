His delivery method was to take etransfer from his clients, pick up the meat fresh from the farm, and deliver it to you. I ordered about 100 bucks worth of meat and he said it would be ready in a few days.\n\nWhen the time to deliver came he texted me at night and told me he caught flu symptoms. Said he needed a few more days. After a few more days when I texted him he said he reorded it fresh for Saturday and I could go pick it up at a store nearby. When I went on Saturday to go pick it up at the specific store, the order wasn\u2019t there. He called me to let me know he\u2019ll deliver it tomorrow night. Sunday night came and he ghosted me after numerous attempts.\n\nHe called me Monday during work and said he\u2019s delivering it. My wife who was working at home picked it up. The meat was old, rotten, and smelly. I let him know I want a refund immediately which he agreed to (via text).\n\nAfter searching his full name on Google, I found out he had a class action lawsuit for his meat store in my city because he scammed 20,000 people for coupons that never exist. He made about 1.5 million and was all over the news for the scam.\n\nIt\u2019s been a month of constant rescheduling and he keeps making excuses to give me my money back.

{"title": "Wristrait Knife Review", "selftext": "I posted a while ago asking for suggestions to help with my wrist tendinitis (link below), and got a response from /u/James_Vaga_Bond. He told me he is developing vertical handled knives which can help with the repetitive motions that cause issues for butchers. He sent me this knife to try and it has certainly helped. For me, putting the strain at the base of my thumb during the steaking motion has been the biggest problem. I used the knife through the holiday season and it has its pros and cons. The pros are that it definitely changes where the stress on my body is, the knife is made with a different metal and stays sharp longer than your standard victorinox knives and it looks awesome. My wrist pain has been dwindling to now, being very manageable. The blade I have is a 10 inch and I find it difficult to steak larger muscles (chuck and ribeye specifically). I think this would be resolved with a 12 inch blade (in the works).

I'm planning to talk to the farmer this weekend about it, but what to know what a butcher thinks about this? I'm wondering if the butcher didn't throw all of the fat into the grind pile to increase his yield? The farmers are nice guys and the rest of the beef is good, so I don't want to be a dick about it, but we spend a lot of money on this. \n\nEdit:  I want to emphasize just how fatty this ground beef. A lot of people are telling me that I should have requested lean meat if I wanted lean meat. But I didn't want lean meat. This meat is so fatty that I have to drain literal cups of grease every time I cook with it. I like fatty meat, but we're talking like 60/40 or maybe even 50/50 here.

Effective immediately, these posts will no longer be allowed in the sub. Even though we as butchers should be able to hazard a guess as to whether or not meat is safe, if we aren't in the room, we shouldn't be making that call for anyone.\n\nHowever, people who aren't butchers may still inquire about if it is safe to prepare meats a certain way. This sub is a safe haven people the world over who've practiced our trade, and I feel it's only fair that we be willing to extent some knowledge to the common Joes who ask questions within reason.\n\nThere is also a distinct lack of a basic \"Respect\" rule in this sub.

Let's bond over that instead of using this platform to tout hate and division. This applies to everyone, all walks of life are welcome here as long as they show a basic human respect to their fellow butchers.\n\nThat about does it for now.

She had no connection to this farmer, just found him online and ordered it. \n\nShe told the butcher that she wanted to smoke her own hams, and to leave them whole. She specifically said that she has a new smoker, and wants to use it on nearly the whole pig. \n\nAfter we got home with the meat and started putting it away we noticed that not only was the meat wrapped HORRIBLY (exposed meat to air in every package horriblenly)but there was only one package labeled ham\u2026.\u201dsmoked ham.\u201d \n\nWe called the butcher to ask where our other ham was and he said that it was cut up \u201cjust like you asked for.\u201d He also said that we asked him to smoke the second ham. \n\nI immediately said that I was standing there when she made the call, and I heard EXACTLY what she said - basically the opposite of what we were given. The butcher responded with \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have written it down if she didn\u2019t say it.\u201d And hung up. \n\n\nToday, my girlfriend went to prepare our \u201csmoked ham\u201d and this is what she found partially wrapped in brown paper inside two pieces of plastic bag. \n\nThis looks nothing like any ham that we have ever had before. It\u2019s also completely raw inside,barely smoked on the outside. \n\nIs this really the whole ham from a 200lb pig, or not? If not, what exactly is this? We ordered the entire pig, and this doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nMy girlfriend thinks that they stole meat from our pig, along with everything else that they did wrong. She deserves her money back, and we haven\u2019t eaten any\u2026 we\u2019re considering taking legal action, and I wanted to ask a butcher for their insight. \n\nI appreciate your time and help in identifying this and helping my extremely upset girlfriend \n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18q1o0l", "created_utc": 1703445085.0, "score": 124, "author": "Unfair-Juice9655", "num_comments": 76, "permalink": "/r/Butchery/comments/18q1o0l/is_this_ham_fishy_to_you_too/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It came to my attention recently that the sub's most active users were growing concerned about the number of \"is this meat safe?\" post. Effective immediately, these posts will no longer be allowed in the sub. Even though we as butchers should be able to hazard a guess as to whether or not meat is safe, if we aren't in the room, we shouldn't be making that call for anyone.\n\nHowever, people who aren't butchers may still inquire about if it is safe to prepare meats a certain way. This sub is a safe haven people the world over who've practiced our trade, and I feel it's only fair that we be willing to extent some knowledge to the common Joes who ask questions within reason.\n\nThere is also a distinct lack of a basic \"Respect\" rule in this sub. Conversations go off course all the time, but I've deleted too many comments in recent months that have used several unsavory slurs or reflected too passionately about the political hellscape that is this planet. There will be zero tolerance regarding bullying, harassment, or hate of any kind. We are all here because we love what we do. Let's bond over that instead of using this platform to tout hate and division. This applies to everyone, all walks of life are welcome here as long as they show a basic human respect to their fellow butchers.\n\nThat about does it for now.

I have tried to film me boning, but I don't have a good camera setup, so I've just had to awkwardly one handed demo what I am trying to explain.\n\nAnyway, to start, score down the top of the lower edge of the blade bone with a nice sharp knife right from the socket to the end of the bone where it goes into the blade tip. Do not score down the edge of the bone, this is important for later. Using your fingers, peel the meat away from the bone to the other edge. You can start this by running the back of the tip of your knife underneath the membrane between the muscle and bone if needed. I haven't filmed that, sorry. You may need to encourage it slightly around the top of the socket with your knife. Scrape, don't cut.\n\nNext, cut the cartilage and scrape around the bottom edge of the socket, down to where the blade protrudes between the feather and Bola. I have explained this in video.\n\nOnce scraped right off, pull the blade up and out with conviction from the socket and it should peel away with a satisfying ripping sound. You should see the membrane on the top of the meat and a clean underside.\n\nSnap the blade off of the blade tip and then remove the tip with your knife.\n\nIt's up to you whether you remove the membrane. Some would argue you should, but I don't. We usually slow cook our shoulders over here and it's never been a problem I've found with eating and mouth feels of the meat etc.\n\nI hope this helps someone.

Am I cutting into the amount of chuck roasts I'd get if I go that route?\n\n3) My favorite cut on the animal is bavette or flap meat but it's not usually cut around here. Are there any other names for this cut to give the butcher so I can make sure to get this piece?\n\nOther things I usually ask for that surprisingly surprises the butchers are the picana/couloutte/sirloin cap left whole, tri-tip left whole, cross cut shanks, flanken ribs (I love korean bbq), flank, and inside & outside skirt.

I deboned one of the legs after removing the shanks, and left the other bone in for future grill/smoking. Made some sirloin chops, and removed the neck for lentil soup. I even have broth currently bubbling away with the bones that I remove, and made tallow from fat I cut off. I am so hooked on this, and love it. I need a better saw, though. Would any hack saw work, or do I need a finer blade? Where should I get them? \n\nTldr: got a lamb, loved the process of butchering it.

{"title": "Beef tallow", "selftext": "After doing some research I decided to try beef tallow on my skin after use of one jar I purchased at a farmers market i liked it but felt i could make it myself cheaper and add shea butter to it to make it less oily \n\nAfter calling all the local butcher shops I didn't have luck finding beef suet so I decided I'd buy tallow from the store instead I know it's not as good and who knows what additives are in it but I found one that was advertised as 100%pure grass fed beef tallow for cooking oil.\n\nThe thing is tho it smelled quite bad and when left at room temperature would partially melt so I decided to make my skincare cream I'd render it a few times to improve the smell and shelf stability \n\nNow I know there is a LOT of conflicting information on how to do this no matter what way you go someone will tell you a different way I decided to wet render it and then do a few dry renders after. I know if I was starting with suet I'd probably just dry render i know that's best but since this was store bought and who knows what's added i decided to wet render it.\n\nI melted it all down and added water and salt i had no idea what i was doing but I strained it and put it in the fridge it seemed to work and did improve the texture and smell\n\nOn my first attempt at a dry render i accidentally burnt it, or at least I think, it turned darker golden and started smoking then I had an accident and it got knocked off the counter and so idk how it would have hardened.\n\nSo I decided to try again this time watching hours of tik tok tallow tutorials and I came up with a plan\n\nI'd wet render on the first render, I did that I wasn't sure how long to let it go so I basically just melted it down with water and salt then let it set. It was perfect when I returned \n\nMy plan was to do dry renders from here on out and try and get the water out by melting it down at a very low heat and gradually once everything had melted to bring it up to 215 degrees for 30 minutes to an hour strain and let cool in the fridge and repeat a few times.\n\nBut my problem was I got it all melted down and was ready to increase the heat monitoring it with a thermometer I started bringing up the temp it got to about 150 degrees and started bubbles i was expecting this but i quickly realized this was out of control just then it exploded a giant bubble and thew oil everywhere I turned off the heat and watched from a distance it continued to bubble pretty aggressively for about 15 minutes till it was cooled down i strained it and let it cool again as it began to cool I could see pockets of water at the bottom so I know there's still water in it.\n\nBut my question is why did it explod at that low of heat the smoke point for tallow should be much higher unless there's something besides tallow in it.\n\nIdk what to do now it has set over night looks beautiful isn't burnt and I am happy with the smell it's pretty hard there was a little water at the bottom that I dried off but what do I do now? \n\nIs it safe to try again?\n\nOr is it gonna explod before it even reaches 200 degrees?\n\nIf i just use it as is will it mold?\n\nCan I store in the fridge to prevent mold?\n\nIt still looks beautiful not burnt or rancid doesn't really smell but I know there is probably water in it still i need suggestions to get the water out without blowing up my house and getting burned.\n\nAny and all advice and tips welcome.\n\nFirst light farms was the brand to be honest I'm not to sure it's actually pure tallow.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Butchery/comments/1j1fpww/beef_tallow/", "created_utc": 1740880107.0, "score": 0, "author": "Mundane_Attitude3851", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Butchery/comments/1j1fpww/beef_tallow/", "html_title": ""}

I have a couple of chest freezers full but they're in the barn and a few weeks ago one failed and I didn't notice until a few days later. The meat had come up to room temperature and was just barely starting to smell. It's all vacuum packed. Definitely not ok for human consumption. It all got thrown in the spare chest freezer that we use for dog food and refrozen while I figured out what to do with it.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was gutted about this after all the work that goes into raising meat. However, our dogs get fed a raw food diet and it would be fine for them. So, now I need a better mincer than the one I have on the old Kenwood chef that gets used when I make the occasional batch of sausages myself.\n\nWhile I have butchered half a pig and half a lamb on the dining table at home in the past because I wanted to understand the process and learn some new skills (got to love Scott Rea's videos on YouTube) I let the butcher at the small local abattoir do the major work for us because he's brilliant and does it so much better than I ever could.\n\nThe bacon and sausages were thankfully all in the second chest freezer so what's left are the big joints of pork that need breaking down and mincing so I can freeze into smaller portions for the dogs. I figured folks on here would have recommendations on what brands are worth looking at that would chew through a couple of hundred kilos of pork without burning out the motor. \n\nAs said, I'm happy to buy second hand but don't know what makes to look for and would appreciate some guidance. \n\nMany thanks.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Butchery/comments/1i1vph4/recommendation_for_an_industrial_mincer/", "created_utc": 1736941800.0, "score": 3, "author": "Safety_Th1rd", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Butchery/comments/1i1vph4/recommendation_for_an_industrial_mincer/", "html_title": ""}

Well, my club finally let me transfer to be a wrapper around August. They weren't happy about it though. It took me a whole month for the transfer to finally go through. \n\nI got my ass whopped and the club manager was being a prick the whole time. He would constantly stop me from wrapping and cleaning to fill the floor or clean purge. But Then I started to kick butt. I closed everything right, cleaned all the bunkers, did donations, cleaned the processing room.  \n\nThen they tried cutting my hours. which was odd because I was closing well. To not have a repeat to what happen at my last club. I asked for a full-time position in the meat department. They stop me from being promoted to cutter because we didn't have a meat lead at the time. So, it fell to managements discretion. I told them I need fulltime because I just moved into a new apartment. They eventually gave me my hours for   wrapping. I still wanted a fulltime position to protect myself. \n\nSo, when they finally promoted a cutter to lead. I asked him if I could become a meat cutter. to my surprise he pushed me through. Without much push back. For some reason the MIT was so pissed I was becoming a cutter. He kept trying to get me to help Club pickup. He was always looking at my cuts, blaming things on me for being wrapped wrong. I don't wrap anymore. WTH?\n\nThese last 2 months have been the worst for me. My lead is MIA all the time. the counter is always empty. they keep pulling cutters to open rotto. which always leaves one person cutting everything. corporate is constantly down there. the truck isn't being thrown. we are having cases of meat having to be tossed. we can't finish the list. \n\nOn top of all of that. I'm being singled out. The club manager is trying really hard to push me back into fulfillment.  He is doing everything from micromanaging, undermining, making me do rotto. Now he is pressuring the fresh manager to get me to keep up bunzel. I never had to do bunzel until yesterday. They had the meat trainer come here. He supposed to evaluate the meat department and train the meat lead. The meat lead was off. I'm pretty sure I passed whatever evaluation they had. outside of one thing. \n\nThey are just finding problems now. If they want to just fire me. Why the fanfare? Can't they just force me out? Why isn't my lead getting any flak? I just started cutting 3 months ago. If the meat trainer says I'm good. Why are they so upset? \n\nI need advice. I can only talk to chatgtb so many times.

I wait for local store sales either as markdowns of >50% or at those times of the seasonal offerings where I try to buy as much product as possible, butcher myself, vacuum pack and deep freeze.  Right now I have loaded up my deep freeze with rock cod (30lbs @ $2.60),  shelled 31-40lb shrimp tails (40lbs @$5), pork loin chops (18lbs @ $1.89lb).  Sometimes I get down voted as I think the amount of time I spend getting \"the deal\" is not considered reasonable for the average guy buying meat to personally consume.  Maybe some think I am too harsh in my opinion that we meat eaters typically pay too much for mediocre meat.\n\nI on the other hand am proud to cook and serve great food at my table due to my detailed efforts to have relationships with my butchers, wait to buy, be  ready to purchase/process/preserve for future consumption.\n\nSo with yesterday's purchase of a 13.58lb prime rib rack roast @$4.97lb from Safeway, total $67.00 AND Fred Meyers sale of same cut of 16.17lbs @ $5.96lb for $96 did I get ripped off?

I have tried to film me boning, but I don't have a good camera setup, so I've just had to awkwardly one handed demo what I am trying to explain.\n\nAnyway, to start, score down the top of the lower edge of the blade bone with a nice sharp knife right from the socket to the end of the bone where it goes into the blade tip. Do not score down the edge of the bone, this is important for later. Using your fingers, peel the meat away from the bone to the other edge. You can start this by running the back of the tip of your knife underneath the membrane between the muscle and bone if needed. I haven't filmed that, sorry. You may need to encourage it slightly around the top of the socket with your knife. Scrape, don't cut.\n\nNext, cut the cartilage and scrape around the bottom edge of the socket, down to where the blade protrudes between the feather and Bola. I have explained this in video.\n\nOnce scraped right off, pull the blade up and out with conviction from the socket and it should peel away with a satisfying ripping sound. You should see the membrane on the top of the meat and a clean underside.\n\nSnap the blade off of the blade tip and then remove the tip with your knife.\n\nIt's up to you whether you remove the membrane. Some would argue you should, but I don't. We usually slow cook our shoulders over here and it's never been a problem I've found with eating and mouth feels of the meat etc.\n\nI hope this helps someone.

{"title": "Questions my half beef order", "selftext": "I order half a beef once a year and will make a couple specific requests but try not to ask the butchers to do anything too far off the cut sheet. I just wanted to ask you folks here some questions so I know what I'm getting into if I request certain cuts. I butcher my own deer and elk so have a tiny amount of knowledge but of course a beef is an entirely different beast!\n\n 1) Last year I tried to order the eye of round left whole but they said they didn't usually do that because it messes with the roast cuts. Which roasts are affected if I have the eye round packaged separately? I remember having some round roasts that looked like half of the roast was part of the eye round so I'm assuming that would get turned into stew meat instead.\n\n2) Is it annoying to request the flat iron and the teres major (or petit tender)? Am I cutting into the amount of chuck roasts I'd get if I go that route?\n\n3) My favorite cut on the animal is bavette or flap meat but it's not usually cut around here. Are there any other names for this cut to give the butcher so I can make sure to get this piece?\n\nOther things I usually ask for that surprisingly surprises the butchers are the picana/couloutte/sirloin cap left whole, tri-tip left whole, cross cut shanks, flanken ribs (I love korean bbq), flank, and inside & outside skirt. I thought these would be more standard cuts but I guess a lot of people just want them ground or turned to stew meat instead. I'm in rural Oregon fwiw\n\nThanks for any insight!

{"title": "Beef tallow", "selftext": "After doing some research I decided to try beef tallow on my skin after use of one jar I purchased at a farmers market i liked it but felt i could make it myself cheaper and add shea butter to it to make it less oily \n\nAfter calling all the local butcher shops I didn't have luck finding beef suet so I decided I'd buy tallow from the store instead I know it's not as good and who knows what additives are in it but I found one that was advertised as 100%pure grass fed beef tallow for cooking oil.\n\nThe thing is tho it smelled quite bad and when left at room temperature would partially melt so I decided to make my skincare cream I'd render it a few times to improve the smell and shelf stability \n\nNow I know there is a LOT of conflicting information on how to do this no matter what way you go someone will tell you a different way I decided to wet render it and then do a few dry renders after. I know if I was starting with suet I'd probably just dry render i know that's best but since this was store bought and who knows what's added i decided to wet render it.\n\nI melted it all down and added water and salt i had no idea what i was doing but I strained it and put it in the fridge it seemed to work and did improve the texture and smell\n\nOn my first attempt at a dry render i accidentally burnt it, or at least I think, it turned darker golden and started smoking then I had an accident and it got knocked off the counter and so idk how it would have hardened.\n\nSo I decided to try again this time watching hours of tik tok tallow tutorials and I came up with a plan\n\nI'd wet render on the first render, I did that I wasn't sure how long to let it go so I basically just melted it down with water and salt then let it set. It was perfect when I returned \n\nMy plan was to do dry renders from here on out and try and get the water out by melting it down at a very low heat and gradually once everything had melted to bring it up to 215 degrees for 30 minutes to an hour strain and let cool in the fridge and repeat a few times.\n\nBut my problem was I got it all melted down and was ready to increase the heat monitoring it with a thermometer I started bringing up the temp it got to about 150 degrees and started bubbles i was expecting this but i quickly realized this was out of control just then it exploded a giant bubble and thew oil everywhere I turned off the heat and watched from a distance it continued to bubble pretty aggressively for about 15 minutes till it was cooled down i strained it and let it cool again as it began to cool I could see pockets of water at the bottom so I know there's still water in it.\n\nBut my question is why did it explod at that low of heat the smoke point for tallow should be much higher unless there's something besides tallow in it.\n\nIdk what to do now it has set over night looks beautiful isn't burnt and I am happy with the smell it's pretty hard there was a little water at the bottom that I dried off but what do I do now? \n\nIs it safe to try again?\n\nOr is it gonna explod before it even reaches 200 degrees?\n\nIf i just use it as is will it mold?\n\nCan I store in the fridge to prevent mold?\n\nIt still looks beautiful not burnt or rancid doesn't really smell but I know there is probably water in it still i need suggestions to get the water out without blowing up my house and getting burned.\n\nAny and all advice and tips welcome.\n\nFirst light farms was the brand to be honest I'm not to sure it's actually pure tallow.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Butchery/comments/1j1fpww/beef_tallow/", "created_utc": 1740880107.0, "score": 0, "author": "Mundane_Attitude3851", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Butchery/comments/1j1fpww/beef_tallow/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Rough question about packaging weight", "selftext": "I was wondering- what percentages of a 1000lb steer goes to which cuts and what percent gets ground by the time they're packaged for sale? Maybe also, how does the weight distribute from a similarly raised 1200 and 1400 lb steer? Does it scale up fairly equally? Do any notes of quality go up or down based on the 1000, 1200, and 1400 lb steer? From your perspective, are there any up sides or down sides to either of these weights that would encourage or discourage a farmer, butcher, or consumer to want to raise/process/consume one of these 3 over a more optimal one?\n\nThis is currently just a mental exercise, but it may lead to more (hopefully).

{"title": "Recommendation for an industrial mincer", "selftext": "TL/DR I'm looking for recommendations of a more industrial mincer than the typical home items, second hand would be fine, I'm based in the UK.\n\nWe have a little smallholding in Devon and raise a few pigs every other year, just for us and family. I have a couple of chest freezers full but they're in the barn and a few weeks ago one failed and I didn't notice until a few days later. The meat had come up to room temperature and was just barely starting to smell. It's all vacuum packed. Definitely not ok for human consumption. It all got thrown in the spare chest freezer that we use for dog food and refrozen while I figured out what to do with it.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was gutted about this after all the work that goes into raising meat. However, our dogs get fed a raw food diet and it would be fine for them. So, now I need a better mincer than the one I have on the old Kenwood chef that gets used when I make the occasional batch of sausages myself.\n\nWhile I have butchered half a pig and half a lamb on the dining table at home in the past because I wanted to understand the process and learn some new skills (got to love Scott Rea's videos on YouTube) I let the butcher at the small local abattoir do the major work for us because he's brilliant and does it so much better than I ever could.\n\nThe bacon and sausages were thankfully all in the second chest freezer so what's left are the big joints of pork that need breaking down and mincing so I can freeze into smaller portions for the dogs. I figured folks on here would have recommendations on what brands are worth looking at that would chew through a couple of hundred kilos of pork without burning out the motor. \n\nAs said, I'm happy to buy second hand but don't know what makes to look for and would appreciate some guidance. \n\nMany thanks.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Butchery/comments/1i1vph4/recommendation_for_an_industrial_mincer/", "created_utc": 1736941800.0, "score": 3, "author": "Safety_Th1rd", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Butchery/comments/1i1vph4/recommendation_for_an_industrial_mincer/", "html_title": ""}

Well, my club finally let me transfer to be a wrapper around August. They weren't happy about it though. It took me a whole month for the transfer to finally go through. \n\nI got my ass whopped and the club manager was being a prick the whole time. He would constantly stop me from wrapping and cleaning to fill the floor or clean purge. But Then I started to kick butt. I closed everything right, cleaned all the bunkers, did donations, cleaned the processing room.  \n\nThen they tried cutting my hours. which was odd because I was closing well. To not have a repeat to what happen at my last club. I asked for a full-time position in the meat department. They stop me from being promoted to cutter because we didn't have a meat lead at the time. So, it fell to managements discretion. I told them I need fulltime because I just moved into a new apartment. They eventually gave me my hours for   wrapping. I still wanted a fulltime position to protect myself. \n\nSo, when they finally promoted a cutter to lead. I asked him if I could become a meat cutter. to my surprise he pushed me through. Without much push back. For some reason the MIT was so pissed I was becoming a cutter. He kept trying to get me to help Club pickup. He was always looking at my cuts, blaming things on me for being wrapped wrong. I don't wrap anymore. WTH?\n\nThese last 2 months have been the worst for me. My lead is MIA all the time. the counter is always empty. they keep pulling cutters to open rotto. which always leaves one person cutting everything. corporate is constantly down there. the truck isn't being thrown. we are having cases of meat having to be tossed. we can't finish the list. \n\nOn top of all of that. I'm being singled out. The club manager is trying really hard to push me back into fulfillment.  He is doing everything from micromanaging, undermining, making me do rotto. Now he is pressuring the fresh manager to get me to keep up bunzel. I never had to do bunzel until yesterday. They had the meat trainer come here. He supposed to evaluate the meat department and train the meat lead. The meat lead was off. I'm pretty sure I passed whatever evaluation they had. outside of one thing. \n\nThey are just finding problems now. If they want to just fire me. Why the fanfare? Can't they just force me out? Why isn't my lead getting any flak? I just started cutting 3 months ago. If the meat trainer says I'm good. Why are they so upset? \n\nI need advice. I can only talk to chatgtb so many times.
