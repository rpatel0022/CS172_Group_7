I paid $200 and got myself these - a kinmedai, a kasugodai, 3 aji fish (pic 8), and a kanpachi. \n\nFilleting all of them and learning how to best treat and process each fish was a stressful encounter. So much so that I forgot to take pictures which is why the nigiri pictures all turned out pretty bad. \n\nAfter this experience, I truly understand why so much money is paid to sushi chefs.

So I had to try it. Turns out it was true... Have never had tomato in a roll before but I honestly enjoyed it for something unique and different.\n\nSalmon was pretty good and the eel was some of the better I've had.\n\nEven the dynamite roll was good, and I usually don't enjoy deep fried rolls that are overloaded with sauce. This one was just small enough that it didn't feel like an assault on my mouth with every massive bite. Was more bite sized and enjoyable.\n\nI'll probably be back to try their toro and negitoro, otherwise known as... Oily Tuna... on the menu, and a few other unique rolls on the menu.

{"title": ".", "selftext": "Hello i am Kush from India. Ive worked at a sushi bar for 1year in dallas,TX, USA making sushi over there. But that job wasn\u2019t a proper one as i used to get paid under the table because of my visa issues ( i went to the US primarily to do my masters in computer science where later i found my passion in cooking and switched). So now ive moved back to India and ive been doing apprenticeship at a hotel here in my hometown. But i dont really like this. I wanto to go japan to study more about sushi. I wanto work over there in japan for a few so that i can gain all the knowledge that i can use. I wanto to go back to the USA someday when i think im ready to open a business, but before that i need to go and learn sushi in japan..ive been thinking of culinary school but its hard for me right now as i have to manage the budget for school and expenses over there at japan. I recently came across an place called Tokyo Sushi School at Ikebukuro, Japan. They say that they have a intensive sushi program for a month where they can train people giving them an experience of a chef who worked for 3years. Also they said that they would assist me in finding a job on their website. The program at tokyo sushi school falls under my budget and the time i need to finish my course is something i could manage..i really wanto do this course thinking it might earn me a job over there in japan and at the same time i dont want to believe in such hunches and totally move out to a different country. Im really interested in this field that right niw all my friends and family are against it and i also have no support but i dont want to back down on this as i can see this happening..its just that im clueless on how to do anything rn as i dont know anyone who can help me out on this\u2026 please try to provide with any helpful information that you think would help me out..thank you very

{"title": "GAME CHANGER: How Premium Japanese Rice Revolutionized My Sushi After 30 Years", "selftext": "*(Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with any mentioned brands and receive no compensation for discussing them. Brand names are used solely as reference points. Many other premium options exist on the market - I encourage you to conduct your own testing rather than simply taking my word for it.)*\n\nAfter 30 years of making sushi, including several training sessions, mainly focused on fish prep, in Japan, I thought I'd reached the ceiling of what was possible with ingredients available in my region. Then yesterday, everything changed. I discovered UONUMA Koshihikari rice, and it's literally a revelation that completely transforms the homemade sushi experience.\n\n# The Kokuho Rose Struggle\n\nFor decades, I used Kokuho Rose like many of us without access to premium Japanese varieties. Let's be honest: this rice never really allowed us to succeed\u2014we were just \"failing less.\" With Kokuho, you're forced into an impossible compromise: either the core remains al dente with a decent surface, or it's well-cooked in the center but becomes mushy on the outside.\n\n# UONUMA Koshihikari: The Revelation\n\nThe difference is MONUMENTAL. This rice has a homogeneous texture from surface to core. It's tender and melting without ever being sticky. It glides in the mouth while perfectly maintaining its structure during handling. Each grain is like a perfect little pearl of texture.\n\n# My Technique Summary\n\nHere's a quick overview of my approach:\n\n1. **\"Thick Mud\" Washing Method**: I weigh the dry rice, then use very little water to create a thick mud. This promotes abrasion between grains and effectively removes starch while limiting water absorption. I rub vigorously, then rinse 2-3 times.\n2. **Precise Water Calculation**: While Kokuho barely tolerates 20% additional water (1.2 ratio), UONUMA performs best with 30% extra water (1.3 ratio). This superior absorption capacity is directly linked to its exceptional texture.\n3. **Cooking and Resting**: After cooking, 10 minutes of rest is crucial. Success indicators include: no excess water on the surface, grains oriented in all directions (some even pointing upward), and an incomparable shine when transferred for seasoning.\n4. **Vinegar Seasoning**: For 500g of dry rice, I use 125ml of vinegar mixture (25%). UONUMA absorbs it with remarkable ease, each grain being uniformly impregnated without crushing.\n\n# The Result\n\nThe final result is light-years ahead of anything I've achieved in three decades with Kokuho. The sushi is light, the texture precise and defined, each bite offers that characteristic melting sensation of Tokyo's finest sushi.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you're a perfectionist who has never been fully satisfied with homemade sushi despite years of practice, I strongly encourage you to invest in Premium Japanese rice. The price difference is more than compensated by the radical transformation of the experience.\n\nI'm planning to write a more detailed article about my specific techniques for washing, cooking, and seasoning this exceptional rice. Let me know if that would interest you!\n\nWho else has made the leap to premium Japanese rice?

{"title": "Confused about Toro!", "selftext": "For context I work at a sushi restaurant and recently we\u2019ve been able to acquire several different cuts of bluefin belly. We\u2019re selling them respectively as toro, chutoro, and otoro.\n\nMy confusion stems from the fact that I was under the impression that toro is a broad term to denote all of the tuna\u2019s belly, while chutoro and otoro are some specific cuts of the belly. Our sushi chef insists that toro is its own cut but no resources I\u2019ve seen in the past nor present seem to support this.\n\nI acknowledge he\u2019s got a lot more experience in preparing and selling sushi than I do, but he also has a bit of a history of dumbing things down for us front of house folk. I\u2019ve asked him what part of the fish this \u201ctoro\u201d comes from and he doesn\u2019t really have an answer for me.\n\nWhen I asked him most recently he went on to explain that this toro is less fatty than chutoro but fattier than any akami cuts. He then pulled up [this graphic](https://karenlynncharters.com/how-to-cut-bluefin-tuna/) breaking down tuna cuts and pointed to the word toro on the side and said that was the part of the fish being used but to me it appears the graphic is just noting the cutoff point at which something can be classified as toro/belly.\n\nMy coworkers all think I\u2019m crazy for caring about this at all but I\u2019m just passionate about what I do and I like to try to educate the customers when they seem like they want to learn more about sushi.\n\nIf anyone has experience breaking down whole tuna or anything like that I\u2019d love to hear whether I\u2019m wrong about this!

{"title": "Sushi Vinegar recipes", "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nI've been lurking on this sub for some time, and love seeing everyone's pics. I especially love when you guys and gals share your homemade sushi. As we all know, sushi making is about attention to details, and the more you can manage, the better your sushi will be. That being said, one of the most fundamental aspects of the sushi (whether it's nigiri or maki) is its rice, called shari, in sushi lingo. And shari's life is in the vinegar the chef is using.\n\nI've done my research and found several recipes I liked, and I'm here to share some of that journey. And ask for your recipes too XD! Let's start with the most common recipe we've all seen:\n\n* Beginner style:\n   * Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 120 ml\n  * Sugar: 3 Tbsp\n  * Salt: 1\u20131.5 tsp\n  * Simple, slightly sweet \u2013 common in Western cookbooks. Dissolve sugar + salt in warmed vinegar; cool and mix into hot rice.\n\nToo boring!\n\n\n* Kanto style:\n   *     Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 100 ml\n   *     Sugar: 2 Tbsp\n   *     Mirin: 1 Tbsp (optional, for extra sweetness)\n   *     Salt: 1 tsp\n   *     Kanto sushi vinegar tends to be sweeter. Some folks even use more sugar. Good for \u201cclassic sweet\u201d shari.\n\nToo sweet for my taste.\n\n\n* Kansai style:\n  * Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 100 ml\n  * Sugar: 1 Tbsp\n  * Mirin (optional): 0.5\u20131 Tbsp\n  * Salt: ~1 tsp\n  * Kansai vinegar is often less sweet and sometimes slightly saltier. Good if you want a more delicate, subtle flavor.\n\n\nI've experimented with these and gradually ended up with my own recipe by piecing different ones together. I have to say that my recipe is not something I would suggest to home cooks as it requires pre-prep (one or two days before you will be making your sushi). It uses two different vinegars (you can experiment with more) and kombu + mirin and sake.\n\n* My style:\n  * Put 10ml of (junmai) sake and 10ml of hon-mirin into a glass bowl and microwave until alcohol had evaporated (~15s or so). To test, swish the liquid, if long leg streaks of alcohol  do no show up -- it's good to go.\n  * Add 70-75ml of seasoned gourmet rice vinegar by [Marukan](https://www.instacart.com/products/16884141-marukan-seasoned-gourmet-rice-vinegar-12-0-fl-oz?retailer_id=279&product_id=16884141&region_id=12398438854)\n  * Add 30-25ml of brown junmai rice vinegar (I used one from [Mizkan](https://a.co/d/1slrrPR), don't buy it on Amazon, Uwajimaya has it for $11, if you're around). If you want darker color -> use more of this type.\n  * 0.5-1 teaspoon of sugar\n  * 1 teaspoon of salt (I used regular, but you can experiment with sea salt, aka `sel gris`, as you can add more of it for flavor while not increasing the overall saltiness)\n  * A piece of kombu (small enough to fit the glass bowl, wipe it slightly before sticking it in)\n  * Put back into the microwave for another 10s\n  * Mix things while the combined vinegar solution is pretty warm (100-140F or 40-60C), do not boil this, the vinegars will fly away.\n  * Cool, cover with the wrap and put into the fridge for at least 12hr, I prefer 24-48hr, it is then usable for up to a week.\n  * When making the rice, put a SMALL piece of kombu (2-3\"x1\") on top of it in the rice cooker. Technically, this isn't part of the vinegar mix, but this is an essential part of my recipe, so I'm listing it.\n  * Add vinegar to the rice while rice is hot and work your hangiri (or steel bowl) magic.\n\n\nI use this for my lighter color shari, it turns almost golden and definitely not white. It is a slightly different color than what Akazu gives you though. To make it darker and even more mouthful (you feel like you're almost eating bread) put a \u00bd cap of sake into the rice cooker, and add \u00bd teaspon of nikiri sauce to the recipe. That will make it prettttty dark, and I am not sure if this shari will be suitable to all maki and nigiri (I only experimented with salmon). It has a very rich, deep, earthy and savory flavor. Despite all the additives, the texture is exactly the same.\n\n\n* Lastly, here is a recipe from [Japanese Food Lab](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/akasu/) which is basically their 3-star Michelin shop's version of the vinegar, with the original notes from the [author](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/aboutus/):\n   *     Unrefined sea salt: 18 g (very mineral-rich, e.g. Maldon; otherwise reduce salt)\n   *     Yokoi\u2019s Yohee Akazu: 40 g\n   *     Iio Jozo Junmai Rice Vinegar: 60 g\n   *     Rishiri Kombu: 8 g\n   *     Aged Soy Sauce (3-year barrel): 5 g\n   *    (Total ~110\u2013120 g before any heating/infusion.)\n* Note: Steep the kombu in the vinegar mixture, possibly warm gently. It\u2019s a salty, umami-heavy blend meant for fish that\u2019s pre-salted (like in true Edomae style). Brands (Yohee, Iio Jozo) are tough to source but represent the chef\u2019s actual preference.\n\n\nI have not tried the last recipe yet, but I have Yokoi's Kohaku vinegar on the way from Japan ($82 for 1.8L) and actively looking to source the Iio Jozo Junmai Rice Vinegar now.\n\n\nI would LOVE to hear feedback and see your recipes. I am especially interested in your vinegars that work with specific fish/filling.\n\n\nAnd remember folks, I am a noob, so doubt me and correct me, I will only appreciate it!\n\nThank y'all for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1jwhctv/sushi_vinegar_recipes/", "created_utc": 1744345008.0, "score": 28, "author": "Informal-Purpose5979", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1jwhctv/sushi_vinegar_recipes/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019ve been selected to do a st\u00e1ge for a high end non-traditional sushi & sashimi restaurant for a line cook/prep cook position. One thing that caught me off was their mention of bringing my knife bag, (although knives would be provided if I didn\u2019t have any) and that really kicked me into tuning into what I  want/need to do to show for success. Of course bringing a knife bag makes sense for the setting, but I\u2019ve not worked in restaurants (apparently long/or proffesion enough) in positions where this is something that would have crossed my mind. I imagine if I went to culinary school this would be a standard, but I\u2019ve only had my fill of being in restaurants that have basic standards and in unorthodox kitchen environments where my own intelligence were at gift to explore for itself. I\u2019ve never really thought about studying the different ways to make cuts, don\u2019t have deboning experience, and have never fil\u00e9\u2019d a fish! \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd But obtaining this opportunity is really important to me, and I think they like me enough as a person to want to bring me for a st\u00e1ge (not to jump the gun) that I\u2019d really like to show up as a top choice and candidate for them with what I\u2019ve got.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if you all may offer any tips and guidance on educating myself in the right direction. I am very confident in myself, I am just not traditionally studied on some \u201cstandards\u201d or basics.\n\nSome ideas that have come up we\u2019re going to one of the local culinary schools and asking if I may audit, or request just a bit of time to go over some of the basics so that I would be prepared to do well for this job. Or to one of the local Michelin star restaurants that a good friend of mine had affiliation with and asking a chef that same thing, with expression about how important to me it would be to score this position. As well as looking up tutorials and studying some basic cutting/mincing/chopping techniques. Also, getting my own knife set. I know something\u2019s might be above and beyond, but those ideas have come instinctually due to my determination to land a position with this restaurant, and the opportunity to head a culinary career. I\u2019d like to show for my intelligence and skill having short a culinary degree, or many years experience in fine dining.\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBest.\n\nP.s.

Usually at a restaurant I see dense 1.5\" tall dry mound of rice with salmon on top and I hate it. But I've had good nigiri at michelin star restaurants and I absolutely love it. The fancy nigiri doesn't seem particularly difficult, it simply has good rice and execution, and at times expensive ingredients of course.\n\nI'd like to make quality nigiri at home. I won't reach michelin star levels but hopefully better than many restaurants. I see three primary limitations:\n\n1. **My skill level.** I have an excellent Japanese knife and know how to sharpen it and I am generally pretty good in the kitchen. That being said I've never tried to cut fish in the nigiri style and rarely deal with fish.  I've never made sushi rice either but I'm good at learning in the kitchen. I believe I could do this well enough with some practice?\n2. **Quality ingredients.** I live in southern Ontario but not in Toronto. I'm sure I could get some salmon and maybe another fish or two of interest but I'm not sure about the rest. I have an ethnic supermarket that I like. I'm guessing the rice is pretty easy to get. Is getting quality fish online viable? Or am I limited to my town?\n3. **Storage and fuss.** Some meals require a lot of mis en place and don't make huge quantities and honestly they're barely worth it. I imagine wanting 3-5 fish for a nigiri meal. I can see myself purchasing whole fish and making portions and freezing what I don't use and thawing at a later date. Is this viable? I can't see myself buying 3-5 fish portions and cutting and slicing and prepping just for one meal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1jvztof/is_making_top_shelf_nigiri_at_home_possible_is_it/", "created_utc": 1744296713.0, "score": 4, "author": "Thorbient", "num_comments": 62, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1jvztof/is_making_top_shelf_nigiri_at_home_possible_is_it/", "html_title": ""}

Think low lighting, warm wood interiors, and intimate seating at the chef\u2019s counter (I believe there are only 8\u201310 seats). It feels exclusive without being pretentious \u2014 very much main character energy.\n\nThe Experience:\nI opted for the full \u201cKill Bill\u201d omakase (MX$2,200, about $130 USD). It\u2019s a 10+ course tasting menu featuring a mix of Mexican and Japanese ingredients. The chefs explain each course, and the pacing is intentional \u2014 slow enough to savor, fast enough to keep it engaging.\n\nStandout Dishes:\n\t\u2022A truffle-topped tuna tartare on crispy nori with edible gold \u2014 literal perfection.\n\t\u2022Wagyu beef with a quail egg yolk in a soy reduction \u2014 melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\n\t\u2022House-cured sashimi selection served in a beautiful ceramic bowl that made me pause before even eating.\n\t\u2022And yes, the sushi is served on those iconic wavy ceramic plates you\u2019ve probably seen in videos.\n\nDrinks:\nThey have a curated sake list and cocktails, but I stuck to sparkling water to keep my palate focused on the food.\n\nReservations:\nYou have to book through Instagram (@killbillcdmx) \u2014 they use WhatsApp to confirm. I recommend booking 2\u20133 weeks in advance since seats fill fast. They offer two seatings per night.\n\nOverall Verdict:\nTotally worth it if you\u2019re a fan of omakase and appreciate a theatrical, multisensory dining experience. The blend of Mexican terroir with Japanese technique is beautifully done. It\u2019s not just about the food \u2014 it\u2019s about the full ambiance.\n\nWould I go again? Yes \u2014 especially to take a friend who\u2019s never had omakase before. It\u2019s a great intro experience that still feels upscale and special.\n\nHappy to answer any questions if you\u2019re planning to go!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1jt98ot/tried_the_viral_omakase_experience_at_kill_bill/", "created_utc": 1743987493.0, "score": 12, "author": "uppitynoire", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1jt98ot/tried_the_viral_omakase_experience_at_kill_bill/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My first time home-making", "selftext": "So... I've started eating sushi not long ago. Given that I like cooking and making things with my hands, this time I wanted to give it a go myself and appreciate the process... Small premise: my partner didn't feel safe having raw tuna at home (and we don't like salmon), so all the fillings didn't have raw fish:\n\n- Surimi, cucumber, avocado (California-inspired)\n- Tuna (can), sushi mayo, cucumber, avocado.\n- Asparagus tempura\n- Prawn tempura, avocado\n\nOverall, I'm not very happy with the result (apologies it looks messy with the sesame seeds sprinkled directly on the plate, but since it took me 2.5h I was running out of time, also slicing the avocado very thinly to put at the top was very hard), particularly because:\n\nRice - I think the quality of the rice was not great (it's what I found in the shop as sushi rice). I rinsed it very well, till the water came out clear. Put 1 cup of rice in 2.5 cups of water in a pot, high heat, when it started boiling reduced the heat, lid on, for 10 mins; after 10 mins, turned off the heat, still lid on, let it sit for another 10 min. Seasoned the rice with 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1.5 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt (previously heated in the microwave so sugar and salt could melt). Distributed on a baking pan and let it cool down. I still think it was slightly overcooked and I was worried it was too much water for this rice I used.\n\nFillings - mmh, not sure what, but I need to come up with better ideas. My partner liked them all, except the tuna one, I didn't mind the tuna one either. I had Philadelphia as well which I planned to use, but didn't in the end. And maybe I felt I was pressing too much when rolling, sometimes the filling was coming out slightly... But felt they were generally bland...\n\nCutting - I had a sharp knife and kept it wet when cutting, but somehow I felt it wasn't sharp enough, cause I couldn't just push down of course, but had to cut by going back and forth... Yet somehow, even though I thought I was gentle, holding the inside out with my other hand's fingers, sometimes was ruining the shape of the roll... So I still feel that the rice was not firm enough (?)\n\nAnyway, maybe I'll give it another try soon...

My gf is now mad at me bc I made a scene. \n\nIf a sushi restaurant has has $17 happy hour specials and noted the difference in vibes between a certain sushi roll and a spring roll - isnt it reasonable to expect they tell you about truffle paste on a sushi roll?\n\nThanks\n\nSo\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1jrp4tx/etiquette_on_bad_sushi_question/", "created_utc": 1743807324.0, "score": 0, "author": "doobiemilesepl", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1jrp4tx/etiquette_on_bad_sushi_question/", "html_title": ""}

Also while I did have a mild case of covid last year, this has been an ongoing thing for 3 *decades*.\n\nThis issue: I've always been excited to try new foods and I've dabbled in trying raw seafood at sushi restaurants for over 3 decades. I like to try simple versions of new things before complex so when I first tried sashimi (raw fish no rice or extras?) I didn't dip in soy sauce or add mayo or wasabi. I tried different cuts of tuna from different parts of the tuna fish, as well as salmon, a piece of yellow tail, and mackerel and I'll be honest I couldn't taste much of anything. My cup of green tea had more flavour and scent. Myself and my sushi-fan friends were all confused. This was at a popular and busy restaurant in Michigan.\n\nI've re-tried over the years at popular places in Illinois, New York, Queensland Australia and New South Wales Australia and still *plain white rice has a stronger flavour*. I'm baffled. Obviously I can just add sauces, seasonings, etc but at that point it's just a textured, flavourless vessel for other flavours.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Is there a way I can *teach* my body to detect the flavours? I'd love to sit and enjoy a poke bowl or a plate of fresh sashimi but at sushi restaurants I have to stick to seared and cooked fish and meat to taste anything. I'm a bit bummed.\n\nEDIT: A few comments are mentioning this one and I forgot to mention this myself - I don't smoke anything and rarely drink. Never had alcohol *while* eating sushi.

{"title": "First timer - need help with a few difficulties?", "selftext": "Our family loves sushi rolls so my wife and I took a sushi class on a recent cruise. Cue my new obsession (thanks ADHD!). I dove head-first down the YouTube rabbit hole, spent way too much on supplies and ingredients at my local Asian market, and we had our first home sushi meal last night.\n\nIt was... not as easy at home as it was on the ship.\n\nIssue #1 - I made 1 cup of rice expecting it to make 5 to 6 rolls (based purely on Google). It *barely* made 2. It seemed like I was using a lot more rice than we did on the ship. We used a full sheet or nori for both so idk what the deal was. I just know on the ship the sushi chef kept telling everyone they had too much rice. And yet I used almost half of my 1 cup of rice for 1 roll.\n\nIssue #2 - my rice was WAY too sticky. I'm talking super glue sticky. I washed itultiple times before cooking (until water was running clear) but it still came out like rat trap glue. That may be what contributed to issue 1 above since I had a difficult time spreading it due to the stickiness. I kept my fingers & hands damp but it didn't matter. \n\nIssue #3 & #4 - the shrimp. Oh my gosh the shrimp. \ud83d\ude21 I bought fresh shrimp (I think they were labeled like 12-15 size) from a local market and went to skewer them (right under the back \"spine\", where the vein runs) in order to boil them and keep them straight, but that's when I noticed they were not deveined. In order to devein them I had to cut the backs open, which meant I could no longer skewer them for cooking.\n\nWhich leads me to the real issue #3 - How the crap do you devein the shrimp without mutilating them? Cutting the back open often times cut the vein open as well, leaving me with a lot of cleanup under cold water. \n\nIssue #4 is a result of #3 - cooking them straight. I resorted to peeling them, cutting slits in the bellies, and cracking the spine in order to flatten them. A couple of them just split it half. The rest of them still curled up when cooking. And they got tough and kind of rubbery. Maybe this is caused from over-cooking them? \n\nEven with all my issues, the family still said it was the best meal I've ever cooked. I'll wear that badge with honor. Taste still ended up amazing.\n\nPrep - 2/10\nPresentation - 6/10\nTaste - 8/10\n\nHow can I improve on my issues above? Is it just practice and experience or is it a procedure and preparation issue?

{"title": "Ch\u012bsai Sushi Club. Unexpectedly adventurous & unique flavours.", "selftext": "Chisai Sushi Club. Unexpectedly adventurous & unique flavours.\n\nGot the Oki Omakase set (17-course, $120 USD) from Chisai Sushi Club. Overall, the interior has a very hip ambiance and you can tell off the bat that it\u2019s not your traditional omakase spot. A lot of unique flavours were brought, some standouts:\n\n(1) Was a bit freaked out by the snail roe on the oysters, but it had a nice brininess and texture similar to ikura. \n\n(2) Albacore sashimi with Chinese seasonings was very unique and had tons of umami. \n\n(4) One of my personal favourites - the fluke with olive oil, flaky lemon salt, and cucumber oil. \n\n(6) Horse mackerel with Indian seasoning paste - I appreciate the creativity, though I found the flavour to be a touch too overwhelming and didn\u2019t let a lot of fish flavour through. \n\n(7) Madai with licorice salt and shiso - really enjoyed the playfulness in having the licorice salt bring out the licorice notes in the shiso, and the madai was a great fish choice to bring that to life. \n\n(12) Loved the European / Mediterranean theme of this piece: mackerel topped with Swedish mustard and dill. Almost had a lox bagel vibe to it. \n\n(13) Barracuda topped with caviar and 1 black peppercorn - such a fun experience when the peppercorn pops in your mouth and brings a little brightness to this otherwise quite savoury bite. \n\n(14) Scallop seared with foie gras - this one wasn\u2019t as unique but had to include it because it was just too good. Impossibly rich and the scallop was very plump and sweet. \n\n(16) The hand rolls were okay.

My understanding is that flash freezing kills parasites. Even warmer freezing temps will kill parasites if it is prolonged freezing.\n\nNow I know that bacterial growth is a concern if the fish has thawed and refrozen, but I don't see how that risk is different from any meat you buy at the store? My understanding is that it isn't just the bacteria that is a concern, but the toxins they leave behind because cooking doesn't get rid of toxins.\n\nI know it isn't a %100 safety guarantee, but it seems reasonable to say that most frozen seafood from any regular grocery store is reasonably safe to eat. It might not be the best quality cut of meat for eating raw, but reasonably safe none the less. Am I on the right track here?

{"title": "Is there a sub for sushi making? As in, specifically to discuss certain aspects that may too niche for broader audience", "selftext": "Subj. I want to get some opinions on my sushi vinegar blend and cutting techniques, but afraid it may be too niche for this sub.\n\nIf this is the right sub then here are my questions (in case anyone would like to share their experience):\n\n* I\u2019ve tried both Mizkan sushi rice vinegar and rice vinegar (plus sugar and salt and a bit of Mirin), using 20% of dry rice weight. Which was the suggestion on the label (4 tablespoons for 2 rice cups, which comes out to 20%). It wasn\u2019t bad at all, but the rice smelled a bit pungent compared to our local sushi restaurant that has good reviews. Their rice was a lot less vinegar\u2019y. \n\n* Roll slicing. I\u2019ve got the yanagiba (I\u2019m lucky as I have access to good knives), but sometimes my rolls are sliced with very little resistance and sometimes my knife just gets stuck in it. My knife is still very sharp, so that\u2019s not the issue. Right now my theories are: mayonnaise is what\u2019s sticking to my knife the most (so use it sparingly); or, slice the rolls RIGHT after they are made, don\u2019t wait to finish all the rolls first (so the rice changes its structure/texture while cooling down and that\u2019s what makes it harder to slice). Also, do I need to prep my nori before using it? Hold over fire (or put in a pan). Does it affect the cutting at all?\n\n\n* Preservation of sushi rice with right temperature. After I make it, my understanding is that as long as it stays body temperature \u2014 it will stay in this ready to make nigiri/rolls state for at least 30 minutes or so. Equally, on the other hand, if the rice isn\u2019t kept at the body temperature after making it (and mixing in the vinegar) then it will become unusable (too sticky and just not as yummy). Is this correct?\n\n\n* Adding kombu to my vinegar. Some say combine ingredients for sushi vinegar in a pot, don\u2019t bring it to boil and remove kombu as soon as all the solids have dissolved. Other people say just whisk it and put kombu for 12-48 hours (and no heating before that at all). Which one is it? Which one extracts the most umami?\n\n\nI\u2019d greatly appreciate your input or suggestions (for a sub or the recipes in general).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1j4n0o5/is_there_a_sub_for_sushi_making_as_in/", "created_utc": 1741234164.0, "score": 3, "author": "mambiki", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1j4n0o5/is_there_a_sub_for_sushi_making_as_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Making tempura", "selftext": "Hello. I have a job in a sushi restaurant. I've been working there for a couple of years as a dishwasher and server but people keep quiting so I was put with no prior experience or knowledge to fry tempura. It has been extremely hard for me. I have an extremely hard time learning things and the cook who is right next to me and teaching me yells and cusses at me everyday. He roughly grabs things out of my hand and he lightly hit my hand when I did not do it right. He is angry with me because I struggle to be fast enough and know when the tempura is done. I also have to help the cook with other things like frying crab puffs, vegetable egg rolls, microwaving things, and assisting him in things he needs help in. I have forgotten the tempura while I'm helping with other things too.  \n\nThe only part of making the tempura I am responsible for is putting it into the flour and then dipping it in batter and frying it and looking after it and then taking it out and knowing if it is done or not. I am struggling especially with the vegetable tempura. The vegetables I have the most trouble with is the cucumber, banana, and yam. I am very confused about what is considered done so I have overcooked then or undercooked them. I also do a Las Vegas Roll tempura and shrimp tempura.  I am yelled at everyday and I go to work with dread and anxiety. I really want to learn this new skill and this is a very good opportunity to me to transition to dishwasher to making tempura. \n\nCan you help me with some tips to making the tempura?\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1j2hqnb/making_tempura/", "created_utc": 1741005544.0, "score": 2, "author": "Cautious_Boss_3211", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1j2hqnb/making_tempura/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": ".", "selftext": "Hello i am Kush from India. Ive worked at a sushi bar for 1year in dallas,TX, USA making sushi over there. But that job wasn\u2019t a proper one as i used to get paid under the table because of my visa issues ( i went to the US primarily to do my masters in computer science where later i found my passion in cooking and switched). So now ive moved back to India and ive been doing apprenticeship at a hotel here in my hometown. But i dont really like this. I wanto to go japan to study more about sushi. I wanto work over there in japan for a few so that i can gain all the knowledge that i can use. I wanto to go back to the USA someday when i think im ready to open a business, but before that i need to go and learn sushi in japan..ive been thinking of culinary school but its hard for me right now as i have to manage the budget for school and expenses over there at japan. I recently came across an place called Tokyo Sushi School at Ikebukuro, Japan. They say that they have a intensive sushi program for a month where they can train people giving them an experience of a chef who worked for 3years. Also they said that they would assist me in finding a job on their website. The program at tokyo sushi school falls under my budget and the time i need to finish my course is something i could manage..i really wanto do this course thinking it might earn me a job over there in japan and at the same time i dont want to believe in such hunches and totally move out to a different country.

{"title": "GAME CHANGER: How Premium Japanese Rice Revolutionized My Sushi After 30 Years", "selftext": "*(Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with any mentioned brands and receive no compensation for discussing them. Brand names are used solely as reference points. Many other premium options exist on the market - I encourage you to conduct your own testing rather than simply taking my word for it.)*\n\nAfter 30 years of making sushi, including several training sessions, mainly focused on fish prep, in Japan, I thought I'd reached the ceiling of what was possible with ingredients available in my region. Then yesterday, everything changed. I discovered UONUMA Koshihikari rice, and it's literally a revelation that completely transforms the homemade sushi experience.\n\n# The Kokuho Rose Struggle\n\nFor decades, I used Kokuho Rose like many of us without access to premium Japanese varieties. Let's be honest: this rice never really allowed us to succeed\u2014we were just \"failing less.\" With Kokuho, you're forced into an impossible compromise: either the core remains al dente with a decent surface, or it's well-cooked in the center but becomes mushy on the outside.\n\n# UONUMA Koshihikari: The Revelation\n\nThe difference is MONUMENTAL. This rice has a homogeneous texture from surface to core. It's tender and melting without ever being sticky. It glides in the mouth while perfectly maintaining its structure during handling. Each grain is like a perfect little pearl of texture.\n\n# My Technique Summary\n\nHere's a quick overview of my approach:\n\n1. **\"Thick Mud\" Washing Method**: I weigh the dry rice, then use very little water to create a thick mud. This promotes abrasion between grains and effectively removes starch while limiting water absorption. I rub vigorously, then rinse 2-3 times.\n2. **Precise Water Calculation**: While Kokuho barely tolerates 20% additional water (1.2 ratio), UONUMA performs best with 30% extra water (1.3 ratio). This superior absorption capacity is directly linked to its exceptional texture.\n3. **Cooking and Resting**: After cooking, 10 minutes of rest is crucial. Success indicators include: no excess water on the surface, grains oriented in all directions (some even pointing upward), and an incomparable shine when transferred for seasoning.\n4. **Vinegar Seasoning**: For 500g of dry rice, I use 125ml of vinegar mixture (25%). UONUMA absorbs it with remarkable ease, each grain being uniformly impregnated without crushing.\n\n# The Result\n\nThe final result is light-years ahead of anything I've achieved in three decades with Kokuho. The sushi is light, the texture precise and defined, each bite offers that characteristic melting sensation of Tokyo's finest sushi.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you're a perfectionist who has never been fully satisfied with homemade sushi despite years of practice, I strongly encourage you to invest in Premium Japanese rice. The price difference is more than compensated by the radical transformation of the experience.\n\nI'm planning to write a more detailed article about my specific techniques for washing, cooking, and seasoning this exceptional rice. Let me know if that would interest you!\n\nWho else has made the leap to premium Japanese rice?

Our sushi chef insists that toro is its own cut but no resources I\u2019ve seen in the past nor present seem to support this.\n\nI acknowledge he\u2019s got a lot more experience in preparing and selling sushi than I do, but he also has a bit of a history of dumbing things down for us front of house folk.

He then pulled up [this graphic](https://karenlynncharters.com/how-to-cut-bluefin-tuna/) breaking down tuna cuts and pointed to the word toro on the side and said that was the part of the fish being used but to me it appears the graphic is just noting the cutoff point at which something can be classified as toro/belly.\n\nMy coworkers all think I\u2019m crazy for caring about this at all but I\u2019m just passionate about what I do and I like to try to educate the customers when they seem like they want to learn more about sushi.\n\nIf anyone has experience breaking down whole tuna or anything like that I\u2019d love to hear whether I\u2019m wrong about this!

One thing that caught me off was their mention of bringing my knife bag, (although knives would be provided if I didn\u2019t have any) and that really kicked me into tuning into what I  want/need to do to show for success. Of course bringing a knife bag makes sense for the setting, but I\u2019ve not worked in restaurants (apparently long/or proffesion enough) in positions where this is something that would have crossed my mind. I imagine if I went to culinary school this would be a standard, but I\u2019ve only had my fill of being in restaurants that have basic standards and in unorthodox kitchen environments where my own intelligence were at gift to explore for itself. I\u2019ve never really thought about studying the different ways to make cuts, don\u2019t have deboning experience, and have never fil\u00e9\u2019d a fish! \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd But obtaining this opportunity is really important to me, and I think they like me enough as a person to want to bring me for a st\u00e1ge (not to jump the gun) that I\u2019d really like to show up as a top choice and candidate for them with what I\u2019ve got.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if you all may offer any tips and guidance on educating myself in the right direction. I am very confident in myself, I am just not traditionally studied on some \u201cstandards\u201d or basics.\n\nSome ideas that have come up we\u2019re going to one of the local culinary schools and asking if I may audit, or request just a bit of time to go over some of the basics so that I would be prepared to do well for this job. Or to one of the local Michelin star restaurants that a good friend of mine had affiliation with and asking a chef that same thing, with expression about how important to me it would be to score this position. As well as looking up tutorials and studying some basic cutting/mincing/chopping techniques. Also, getting my own knife set. I know something\u2019s might be above and beyond, but those ideas have come instinctually due to my determination to land a position with this restaurant, and the opportunity to head a culinary career. I\u2019d like to show for my intelligence and skill having short a culinary degree, or many years experience in fine dining.\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBest.\n\nP.s.

{"title": "Sushi Vinegar recipes", "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nI've been lurking on this sub for some time, and love seeing everyone's pics. I especially love when you guys and gals share your homemade sushi. As we all know, sushi making is about attention to details, and the more you can manage, the better your sushi will be. That being said, one of the most fundamental aspects of the sushi (whether it's nigiri or maki) is its rice, called shari, in sushi lingo. And shari's life is in the vinegar the chef is using.\n\nI've done my research and found several recipes I liked, and I'm here to share some of that journey. And ask for your recipes too XD! Let's start with the most common recipe we've all seen:\n\n* Beginner style:\n   * Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 120 ml\n  * Sugar: 3 Tbsp\n  * Salt: 1\u20131.5 tsp\n  * Simple, slightly sweet \u2013 common in Western cookbooks. Dissolve sugar + salt in warmed vinegar; cool and mix into hot rice.\n\nToo boring!\n\n\n* Kanto style:\n   *     Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 100 ml\n   *     Sugar: 2 Tbsp\n   *     Mirin: 1 Tbsp (optional, for extra sweetness)\n   *     Salt: 1 tsp\n   *     Kanto sushi vinegar tends to be sweeter. Some folks even use more sugar. Good for \u201cclassic sweet\u201d shari.\n\nToo sweet for my taste.\n\n\n* Kansai style:\n  * Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 100 ml\n  * Sugar: 1 Tbsp\n  * Mirin (optional): 0.5\u20131 Tbsp\n  * Salt: ~1 tsp\n  * Kansai vinegar is often less sweet and sometimes slightly saltier. Good if you want a more delicate, subtle flavor.\n\n\nI've experimented with these and gradually ended up with my own recipe by piecing different ones together. I have to say that my recipe is not something I would suggest to home cooks as it requires pre-prep (one or two days before you will be making your sushi). It uses two different vinegars (you can experiment with more) and kombu + mirin and sake.\n\n* My style:\n  * Put 10ml of (junmai) sake and 10ml of hon-mirin into a glass bowl and microwave until alcohol had evaporated (~15s or so). To test, swish the liquid, if long leg streaks of alcohol  do no show up -- it's good to go.\n  * Add 70-75ml of seasoned gourmet rice vinegar by [Marukan](https://www.instacart.com/products/16884141-marukan-seasoned-gourmet-rice-vinegar-12-0-fl-oz?retailer_id=279&product_id=16884141&region_id=12398438854)\n  * Add 30-25ml of brown junmai rice vinegar (I used one from [Mizkan](https://a.co/d/1slrrPR), don't buy it on Amazon, Uwajimaya has it for $11, if you're around). If you want darker color -> use more of this type.\n  * 0.5-1 teaspoon of sugar\n  * 1 teaspoon of salt (I used regular, but you can experiment with sea salt, aka `sel gris`, as you can add more of it for flavor while not increasing the overall saltiness)\n  * A piece of kombu (small enough to fit the glass bowl, wipe it slightly before sticking it in)\n  * Put back into the microwave for another 10s\n  * Mix things while the combined vinegar solution is pretty warm (100-140F or 40-60C), do not boil this, the vinegars will fly away.\n  * Cool, cover with the wrap and put into the fridge for at least 12hr, I prefer 24-48hr, it is then usable for up to a week.\n  * When making the rice, put a SMALL piece of kombu (2-3\"x1\") on top of it in the rice cooker. Technically, this isn't part of the vinegar mix, but this is an essential part of my recipe, so I'm listing it.\n  * Add vinegar to the rice while rice is hot and work your hangiri (or steel bowl) magic.\n\n\nI use this for my lighter color shari, it turns almost golden and definitely not white. It is a slightly different color than what Akazu gives you though. To make it darker and even more mouthful (you feel like you're almost eating bread) put a \u00bd cap of sake into the rice cooker, and add \u00bd teaspon of nikiri sauce to the recipe. That will make it prettttty dark, and I am not sure if this shari will be suitable to all maki and nigiri (I only experimented with salmon). It has a very rich, deep, earthy and savory flavor. Despite all the additives, the texture is exactly the same.\n\n\n* Lastly, here is a recipe from [Japanese Food Lab](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/akasu/) which is basically their 3-star Michelin shop's version of the vinegar, with the original notes from the [author](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/aboutus/):\n   *     Unrefined sea salt: 18 g (very mineral-rich, e.g. Maldon; otherwise reduce salt)\n   *     Yokoi\u2019s Yohee Akazu: 40 g\n   *     Iio Jozo Junmai Rice Vinegar: 60 g\n   *     Rishiri Kombu: 8 g\n   *     Aged Soy Sauce (3-year barrel): 5 g\n   *    (Total ~110\u2013120 g before any heating/infusion.)\n* Note: Steep the kombu in the vinegar mixture, possibly warm gently. It\u2019s a salty, umami-heavy blend meant for fish that\u2019s pre-salted (like in true Edomae style). Brands (Yohee, Iio Jozo) are tough to source but represent the chef\u2019s actual preference.\n\n\nI have not tried the last recipe yet, but I have Yokoi's Kohaku vinegar on the way from Japan ($82 for 1.8L) and actively looking to source the Iio Jozo Junmai Rice Vinegar now.\n\n\nI would LOVE to hear feedback and see your recipes. I am especially interested in your vinegars that work with specific fish/filling.\n\n\nAnd remember folks, I am a noob, so doubt me and correct me, I will only appreciate it!\n\nThank y'all for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1jwhctv/sushi_vinegar_recipes/", "created_utc": 1744345008.0, "score": 27, "author": "Informal-Purpose5979", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1jwhctv/sushi_vinegar_recipes/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Is making top shelf nigiri at home possible? Is it worth the trouble?", "selftext": "I love good nigiri and hate bad nigiri. Usually at a restaurant I see dense 1.5\" tall dry mound of rice with salmon on top and I hate it. But I've had good nigiri at michelin star restaurants and I absolutely love it. The fancy nigiri doesn't seem particularly difficult, it simply has good rice and execution, and at times expensive ingredients of course.\n\nI'd like to make quality nigiri at home. I won't reach michelin star levels but hopefully better than many restaurants. I see three primary limitations:\n\n1. **My skill level.** I have an excellent Japanese knife and know how to sharpen it and I am generally pretty good in the kitchen. That being said I've never tried to cut fish in the nigiri style and rarely deal with fish.  I've never made sushi rice either but I'm good at learning in the kitchen. I believe I could do this well enough with some practice?\n2. **Quality ingredients.** I live in southern Ontario but not in Toronto. I'm sure I could get some salmon and maybe another fish or two of interest but I'm not sure about the rest. I have an ethnic supermarket that I like. I'm guessing the rice is pretty easy to get. Is getting quality fish online viable? Or am I limited to my town?\n3. **Storage and fuss.** Some meals require a lot of mis en place and don't make huge quantities and honestly they're barely worth it. I imagine wanting 3-5 fish for a nigiri meal. I can see myself purchasing whole fish and making portions and freezing what I don't use and thawing at a later date. Is this viable?

And that the fine dining options that people pay up for either 1) are overrated due to hype and popularity as opposed to true value or 2) have rare, super-high-end ingredients.\n\nI am planning on lining up early for Sushidai in Tsukiji (6k yen, and I hear it\u2019s great value). \nBut other than that, how do I know whether even more expensive sushiya\u2019s are worth it?

Think low lighting, warm wood interiors, and intimate seating at the chef\u2019s counter (I believe there are only 8\u201310 seats). It feels exclusive without being pretentious \u2014 very much main character energy.\n\nThe Experience:\nI opted for the full \u201cKill Bill\u201d omakase (MX$2,200, about $130 USD). It\u2019s a 10+ course tasting menu featuring a mix of Mexican and Japanese ingredients. The chefs explain each course, and the pacing is intentional \u2014 slow enough to savor, fast enough to keep it engaging.\n\nStandout Dishes:\n\t\u2022A truffle-topped tuna tartare on crispy nori with edible gold \u2014 literal perfection.\n\t\u2022Wagyu beef with a quail egg yolk in a soy reduction \u2014 melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\n\t\u2022House-cured sashimi selection served in a beautiful ceramic bowl that made me pause before even eating.\n\t\u2022And yes, the sushi is served on those iconic wavy ceramic plates you\u2019ve probably seen in videos.\n\nDrinks:\nThey have a curated sake list and cocktails, but I stuck to sparkling water to keep my palate focused on the food.\n\nReservations:\nYou have to book through Instagram (@killbillcdmx) \u2014 they use WhatsApp to confirm. I recommend booking 2\u20133 weeks in advance since seats fill fast. They offer two seatings per night.\n\nOverall Verdict:\nTotally worth it if you\u2019re a fan of omakase and appreciate a theatrical, multisensory dining experience. The blend of Mexican terroir with Japanese technique is beautifully done. It\u2019s not just about the food \u2014 it\u2019s about the full ambiance.\n\nWould I go again? Yes \u2014 especially to take a friend who\u2019s never had omakase before.

{"title": "My first time home-making", "selftext": "So... I've started eating sushi not long ago. Given that I like cooking and making things with my hands, this time I wanted to give it a go myself and appreciate the process... Small premise: my partner didn't feel safe having raw tuna at home (and we don't like salmon), so all the fillings didn't have raw fish:\n\n- Surimi, cucumber, avocado (California-inspired)\n- Tuna (can), sushi mayo, cucumber, avocado.\n- Asparagus tempura\n- Prawn tempura, avocado\n\nOverall, I'm not very happy with the result (apologies it looks messy with the sesame seeds sprinkled directly on the plate, but since it took me 2.5h I was running out of time, also slicing the avocado very thinly to put at the top was very hard), particularly because:\n\nRice - I think the quality of the rice was not great (it's what I found in the shop as sushi rice). I rinsed it very well, till the water came out clear. Put 1 cup of rice in 2.5 cups of water in a pot, high heat, when it started boiling reduced the heat, lid on, for 10 mins; after 10 mins, turned off the heat, still lid on, let it sit for another 10 min. Seasoned the rice with 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1.5 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt (previously heated in the microwave so sugar and salt could melt). Distributed on a baking pan and let it cool down. I still think it was slightly overcooked and I was worried it was too much water for this rice I used.\n\nFillings - mmh, not sure what, but I need to come up with better ideas. My partner liked them all, except the tuna one, I didn't mind the tuna one either. I had Philadelphia as well which I planned to use, but didn't in the end. And maybe I felt I was pressing too much when rolling, sometimes the filling was coming out slightly... But felt they were generally bland...\n\nCutting - I had a sharp knife and kept it wet when cutting, but somehow I felt it wasn't sharp enough, cause I couldn't just push down of course, but had to cut by going back and forth... Yet somehow, even though I thought I was gentle, holding the inside out with my other hand's fingers, sometimes was ruining the shape of the roll... So I still feel that the rice was not firm enough (?)\n\nAnyway, maybe I'll give it another try soon...

{"title": "Looking for insight into why I can't decern any flavour at all when eating raw seafoods.", "selftext": "First of all I'm not great with terminology so I apologise for what is about to be a series of layman vocabulary choices. Also while I did have a mild case of covid last year, this has been an ongoing thing for 3 *decades*.\n\nThis issue: I've always been excited to try new foods and I've dabbled in trying raw seafood at sushi restaurants for over 3 decades. I like to try simple versions of new things before complex so when I first tried sashimi (raw fish no rice or extras?) I didn't dip in soy sauce or add mayo or wasabi. I tried different cuts of tuna from different parts of the tuna fish, as well as salmon, a piece of yellow tail, and mackerel and I'll be honest I couldn't taste much of anything. My cup of green tea had more flavour and scent. Myself and my sushi-fan friends were all confused. This was at a popular and busy restaurant in Michigan.\n\nI've re-tried over the years at popular places in Illinois, New York, Queensland Australia and New South Wales Australia and still *plain white rice has a stronger flavour*. I'm baffled. Obviously I can just add sauces, seasonings, etc but at that point it's just a textured, flavourless vessel for other flavours.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Is there a way I can *teach* my body to detect the flavours? I'd love to sit and enjoy a poke bowl or a plate of fresh sashimi but at sushi restaurants I have to stick to seared and cooked fish and meat to taste anything. I'm a bit bummed.\n\nEDIT: A few comments are mentioning this one and I forgot to mention this myself - I don't smoke anything and rarely drink. Never had alcohol *while* eating sushi.

{"title": "First timer - need help with a few difficulties?", "selftext": "Our family loves sushi rolls so my wife and I took a sushi class on a recent cruise. Cue my new obsession (thanks ADHD!). I dove head-first down the YouTube rabbit hole, spent way too much on supplies and ingredients at my local Asian market, and we had our first home sushi meal last night.\n\nIt was... not as easy at home as it was on the ship.\n\nIssue #1 - I made 1 cup of rice expecting it to make 5 to 6 rolls (based purely on Google). It *barely* made 2. It seemed like I was using a lot more rice than we did on the ship. We used a full sheet or nori for both so idk what the deal was. I just know on the ship the sushi chef kept telling everyone they had too much rice. And yet I used almost half of my 1 cup of rice for 1 roll.\n\nIssue #2 - my rice was WAY too sticky. I'm talking super glue sticky. I washed itultiple times before cooking (until water was running clear) but it still came out like rat trap glue. That may be what contributed to issue 1 above since I had a difficult time spreading it due to the stickiness. I kept my fingers & hands damp but it didn't matter. \n\nIssue #3 & #4 - the shrimp. Oh my gosh the shrimp. \ud83d\ude21 I bought fresh shrimp (I think they were labeled like 12-15 size) from a local market and went to skewer them (right under the back \"spine\", where the vein runs) in order to boil them and keep them straight, but that's when I noticed they were not deveined. In order to devein them I had to cut the backs open, which meant I could no longer skewer them for cooking.\n\nWhich leads me to the real issue #3 - How the crap do you devein the shrimp without mutilating them? Cutting the back open often times cut the vein open as well, leaving me with a lot of cleanup under cold water. \n\nIssue #4 is a result of #3 - cooking them straight. I resorted to peeling them, cutting slits in the bellies, and cracking the spine in order to flatten them. A couple of them just split it half. The rest of them still curled up when cooking. And they got tough and kind of rubbery. Maybe this is caused from over-cooking them? \n\nEven with all my issues, the family still said it was the best meal I've ever cooked. I'll wear that badge with honor. Taste still ended up amazing.\n\nPrep - 2/10\nPresentation - 6/10\nTaste - 8/10\n\nHow can I improve on my issues above? Is it just practice and experience or is it a procedure and preparation issue?

Unexpectedly adventurous & unique flavours.\n\nGot the Oki Omakase set (17-course, $120 USD) from Chisai Sushi Club. Overall, the interior has a very hip ambiance and you can tell off the bat that it\u2019s not your traditional omakase spot. A lot of unique flavours were brought, some standouts:\n\n(1) Was a bit freaked out by the snail roe on the oysters, but it had a nice brininess and texture similar to ikura. \n\n(2) Albacore sashimi with Chinese seasonings was very unique and had tons of umami. \n\n(4) One of my personal favourites - the fluke with olive oil, flaky lemon salt, and cucumber oil. \n\n(6) Horse mackerel with Indian seasoning paste - I appreciate the creativity, though I found the flavour to be a touch too overwhelming and didn\u2019t let a lot of fish flavour through. \n\n(7) Madai with licorice salt and shiso - really enjoyed the playfulness in having the licorice salt bring out the licorice notes in the shiso, and the madai was a great fish choice to bring that to life. \n\n(12) Loved the European / Mediterranean theme of this piece: mackerel topped with Swedish mustard and dill. Almost had a lox bagel vibe to it. \n\n(13) Barracuda topped with caviar and 1 black peppercorn - such a fun experience when the peppercorn pops in your mouth and brings a little brightness to this otherwise quite savoury bite. \n\n(14) Scallop seared with foie gras - this one wasn\u2019t as unique but had to include it because it was just too good. Impossibly rich and the scallop was very plump and sweet. \n\n(16) The hand rolls were okay. Yellowtail + zucchini, spicy tuna + bamboo shoot. \n\nOverall had a great time and chef Darren has such a whimsical and fun spirit that ties the whole room together. Definitely a spot for sushi enjoyers who are looking to step out of their comfort zone and experience unique flavour pairings. Though some of the flavourings were perhaps *too* unique for me, it\u2019s undeniable that a lot of thought went into each piece and was ultimately worth the experience.

My understanding is that flash freezing kills parasites. Even warmer freezing temps will kill parasites if it is prolonged freezing.\n\nNow I know that bacterial growth is a concern if the fish has thawed and refrozen, but I don't see how that risk is different from any meat you buy at the store? My understanding is that it isn't just the bacteria that is a concern, but the toxins they leave behind because cooking doesn't get rid of toxins.\n\nI know it isn't a %100 safety guarantee, but it seems reasonable to say that most frozen seafood from any regular grocery store is reasonably safe to eat. It might not be the best quality cut of meat for eating raw, but reasonably safe none the less. Am I on the right track here?

Should I order some nigiri from my favorite sushi place? \n\nThank you!! \n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1j5cecn/omakase_newbie/", "created_utc": 1741312464.0, "score": 1, "author": "racoonisms", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1j5cecn/omakase_newbie/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Is there a sub for sushi making? As in, specifically to discuss certain aspects that may too niche for broader audience", "selftext": "Subj. I want to get some opinions on my sushi vinegar blend and cutting techniques, but afraid it may be too niche for this sub.\n\nIf this is the right sub then here are my questions (in case anyone would like to share their experience):\n\n* I\u2019ve tried both Mizkan sushi rice vinegar and rice vinegar (plus sugar and salt and a bit of Mirin), using 20% of dry rice weight. Which was the suggestion on the label (4 tablespoons for 2 rice cups, which comes out to 20%). It wasn\u2019t bad at all, but the rice smelled a bit pungent compared to our local sushi restaurant that has good reviews. Their rice was a lot less vinegar\u2019y. \n\n* Roll slicing. I\u2019ve got the yanagiba (I\u2019m lucky as I have access to good knives), but sometimes my rolls are sliced with very little resistance and sometimes my knife just gets stuck in it. My knife is still very sharp, so that\u2019s not the issue. Right now my theories are: mayonnaise is what\u2019s sticking to my knife the most (so use it sparingly); or, slice the rolls RIGHT after they are made, don\u2019t wait to finish all the rolls first (so the rice changes its structure/texture while cooling down and that\u2019s what makes it harder to slice). Also, do I need to prep my nori before using it? Hold over fire (or put in a pan). Does it affect the cutting at all?\n\n\n* Preservation of sushi rice with right temperature. After I make it, my understanding is that as long as it stays body temperature \u2014 it will stay in this ready to make nigiri/rolls state for at least 30 minutes or so. Equally, on the other hand, if the rice isn\u2019t kept at the body temperature after making it (and mixing in the vinegar) then it will become unusable (too sticky and just not as yummy). Is this correct?\n\n\n* Adding kombu to my vinegar. Some say combine ingredients for sushi vinegar in a pot, don\u2019t bring it to boil and remove kombu as soon as all the solids have dissolved. Other people say just whisk it and put kombu for 12-48 hours (and no heating before that at all). Which one is it? Which one extracts the most umami?\n\n\nI\u2019d greatly appreciate your input or suggestions (for a sub or the recipes in general).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1j4n0o5/is_there_a_sub_for_sushi_making_as_in/", "created_utc": 1741234164.0, "score": 3, "author": "mambiki", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1j4n0o5/is_there_a_sub_for_sushi_making_as_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

He roughly grabs things out of my hand and he lightly hit my hand when I did not do it right. He is angry with me because I struggle to be fast enough and know when the tempura is done. I also have to help the cook with other things like frying crab puffs, vegetable egg rolls, microwaving things, and assisting him in things he needs help in. I have forgotten the tempura while I'm helping with other things too.  \n\nThe only part of making the tempura I am responsible for is putting it into the flour and then dipping it in batter and frying it and looking after it and then taking it out and knowing if it is done or not. I am struggling especially with the vegetable tempura. The vegetables I have the most trouble with is the cucumber, banana, and yam. I am very confused about what is considered done so I have overcooked then or undercooked them. I also do a Las Vegas Roll tempura and shrimp tempura.

Dashi soy sauce, pickled ginger, kizami wasabi and ikura in between. I used an akasu vinegar (usually used in Edomai style sushi) with sugar, salt, soy sauce. Also used kombu when cooking up the rice.\n\nI am always working to improve presentation which isn't my strong suit, but this was delicious and I think great ingredients present well even if the person who uses them isn't perfect with all the placement.\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/nigir-sashimi-chirashi-02-27-ncBvYPd](https://imgur.com/gallery/nigir-sashimi-chirashi-02-27-ncBvYPd)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1j0qd5e/dinner_last_night/", "created_utc": 1740800283.0, "score": 5, "author": "cyclorphan", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1j0qd5e/dinner_last_night/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
