You want it to look creamy and will just add this sauce to the shredded, cooked chicken.\n\n1. Dice the chicken breasts into 1-2'' inches so that it cooks quicker.\n2. Boil enough water to submerge your chicken and add some salt. Cover with lid and stir occasionally for 10-15 min.\n3. Shred chicken (Using 2 forks lol). Add your sauce and you're done!\n\n**TLDR: Boil chicken, shred, add chipotle sauce, eat.**\n\nI used to warm the sauce up in pan prior to adding it to the chicken, but have found that if you add it quick enough to your hot chicken, it tastes just as good.\n\nI love eating this with flour tortillas, white rice, or in tortas (AKA sandwiches).

{"title": "How about some more realistic college recipes?", "selftext": "In this subreddit, and seemingly across the internet, people seem to have no idea what constitutes \"student food\".\n\n\nStudent food should:\n\n- have relatively few, common, cheap ingredients\n\n- require no special equipment beyond a frying pan or a single standard pot (microwave, toaster oven a bonus for our dorm-bound brethren). That means panini presses, no waffle irons, no pressure cookers.\n\n- take no more than 15-30 minutes for prep, cooking, eating, and ALL cleanup (amortization over several days via leftovers is acceptable, as long as its not more than 1 hour in a given day). Most days I seriously have 30 minutes for the ENTIRE DAY to eat, and the larger the block of time, the harder it is to fit it in. Even 5 minutes extra is cutting into my already unhealthy sleep schedule. I also think some people seriously underestimate cleanup time -- having to do dishes at all adds 15 minutes or more.\n\n\nGood examples:\n\nPB&J (errynight!)\n\nKraft dinner (pushing it time-wise, but can cook multiple boxes)\n\nGrilled cheese\n\nFried balogna sandwiches\n\nDeli sandwiches, whatever meat is cheapest (Bologna or mortadella usually)\n\n\nAnyways, just trying to give some perspective of what an actual student goes through, since most of the pinterest \"lists\" are clearly not written by students (brie? baked salmon? hell even hamburger is so expensive these days you might as well eat out).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/3fle31/how_about_some_more_realistic_college_recipes/", "created_utc": 1438585169.0, "score": 20, "author": "None", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/3fle31/how_about_some_more_realistic_college_recipes/", "html_title": ""}

Squeeze excess liquid once cool.\n\nCrush the garlic cloves with the flat of your knife to quickly take off the skin and then slice it up. Chop up dat onion and heat some oil and/or butter in a large sauce pan. Toss them in and stir them up to brown a bit. Toss in the greens and mushrooms and cook until they are wilted, just a few minutes.\n\nMake ramen as per usual - I like mushroom ramen for this recipe. The \"healthy\" option is to forgo the powder, but I just mix the powder in with the noodles and then drain the noodles after they sit for a bit.

Pre-heat your oven to 375 (or whatever temperature your croissants tell you to) and pop those suckers open, rolling them out onto a non-stick pan.\n\n2. In a bowl toss in your shredded cheddar, pour in the Ranch, the Frank's, and add in a bit of garlic powder (how much is up to you) and mix it all together.\n\n3. Spoon out the buffalo mixture and spread it across your croissant triangles. Top that with a slice of mozzarella, whichever meat you chose, and then spread a little more of that buffalo on top of that!\n\n4. Roll your croissants up as you would normally. They'll bulge and the buffalo mixture will squish out deliciously. This is normal, you aren't a failure. :)\n\n5. In a microwave-safe mug/bowl melt your butter and some more garlic powder for about 10 seconds. Get it melty enough to spread it across the tops of your croissants and let a little drip into the stuffing of your croissants if you wish, because garlic butter is magical.\n\n6. Stick the pan in the oven and bake for about 12 minutes, checking on it occasionally. You may have to adjust the baking time depending on your oven.

{"title": "101 Exotic Sandwich Recipes To Try", "selftext": "Hi Everyone, \nI was trying to make some sandwiches at home. I was really bored making the same old sandwiches again and again. So I tried googling for some app that gives me some good sandwich recipes. All I could find was apps that gave me an headache with their over the top advertising and not so clear recipes. So over the day I googled each recipe and tried making them. After making 50 or so sandwiches that I really enjoyed tasting, I had an idea to share these recipes as an app and to spread the sunshine. So I created the following app keeping in mind of all the difficulties I faced while searching for exotic sandwiches to make. You can download it at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eightloop.com.a101sandwiches&hl=en.\nSome of the sandwiches you can find in the app are\n\n1. Croque Madam\n\n2. Yakisoba Pan\n\n3. The Primanti\n\n4. Roti John\n\n5. Fluffernutter\n\n6. Prochetta\n\n7. Brownie Ice Cream Sandwich\n\nand 94 more.\n\nOnce again you can download the app @ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eightloop.com.a101sandwiches&hl=en.\nPlease and do please let me know your comments, reviews and advice on how to improve and what else I can do to help.\n\nItadakimasu", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/5w9cns/101_exotic_sandwich_recipes_to_try/", "created_utc": 1488100044.0, "score": 15, "author": "darthjedibinks", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/5w9cns/101_exotic_sandwich_recipes_to_try/", "html_title": ""}

Alrighty, that being said...\n\n**What you need**:\n\n*For the rolls*\n* 1 can of regular size crescent rolls\n* 1 Tblsp butter\n* brown sugar\n* cinnamon (there were no specific measurements for these two)\n\n*For the icing*\n* 1/2-1 cup powdered sugar\n* 1/2 tsp brown sugar\n* 1/4 tsp vanilla\n* 1/2 Tblsp butter, melted\n* whole milk, as needed\n\n**What you do**:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 375 F\n2. Roll out your crescent rolls and press them into one long sheet of dough.\n3. Spread the butter over the dough. Mix your brown sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle it over the top of the butter in a nice, even layer.\n4. Roll the dough into a log. Slice the dough every one inch.\n5. Place rolls in a greased baking pan and bake about 9 minutes.\n6. While the rolls are baking, you'll mix up your icing. Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Add brown sugar and vanilla and mix.\n7. Next, add your powdered sugar. Stir together, adding milk as needed to reach the right consistency. \n8. Drizzle your icing over your rolls when you pull them out of the oven and \"let them cool\"... I skip that part, usually.\n9.

Here's one of my go-to daily meals when I'm keeping a tight rein on my budget. Had some for lunch, as a matter of fact :)\n___\n\n**Chicken Ramen:**\n\n* miso paste\n* kimchi\n* frozen veggies\n* peanut butter\n* sriracha sauce\n* soy sauce\n\n**Beef Ramen:**\n\n* miso paste or douchi (Chinese fermented soy beans)\n* canned beans (I prefer unflavored black beans)\n* canned, diced tomatoes\n* frozen veggies\n* pepper flakes and/or Tabasco\n* Parmesan cheese\n\n(Of course, if you can afford some actual meat to add to these, go for it!)\n___\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* I try to get the better quality ramen, the kind that comes in a big bowl, just because it tastes better.\n* Add the miso and kimchi *after* the soup is well-cooked and ready to eat. This keeps the healthful cultures in both of these foods alive.\n* A little miso goes a long way! Use sparingly until you know how much you like.\n* Miso and kimchi will keep for quite a long time if properly stored, preferably in glass containers.\n* These are pretty high-sodium concoctions, so try to get the low sodium versions of any of the above ingredients whenever possible.\n* If there is *any* kind of Asian community in your town, find a local grocery and shop there for the miso, douchi, and kimchi. They tend to be much cheaper there than at places like Whole Foods (total rip-off). Don't worry if they aren't Japanese or Korean. My local source is a Cambodian grocery here in Long Beach that sells American-made low-sodium miso. You can also often find analogs (such as the Korean version of miso, *doenjang*.) That said, I usually avoid anything from China that's really, really, ridiculously cheap.\n\nI hope this helps!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/1ntfnr/yet_another_ramen_recipe_using_miso_paste_and/", "created_utc": 1381022370.0, "score": 10, "author": "losanglo", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/1ntfnr/yet_another_ramen_recipe_using_miso_paste_and/", "html_title": ""}

We're still early in our journey so just having more people try the app and provide feedback is immensely helpful.\n\nTo anyone who helped us test the app - THANK YOU!

For black friday my parents have agreed to buy me another appliance I can use to cook from my dorm room (already have an air fryer).  \n\n\n I was wondering what would open be the best between a pressure cooker and a mini convection over/ bigger air fryer (that would replace the ninja foodi I have atm).  \n The oven would allow me to bake pasta/bread/snacks etc (the main drawback of the air fryer, the two zones make it impossible to cook something other than a cookie in it).   \n\n\nBUT the pressure cooker would allow me to make rice, soup, curries and chilis which would reduce my grocery bills (I currently eat a piece of meat + veggies cooked in the air fryer). Drawback of the pressure cooker is that I still can't bake and will likely end up buying a ton of muffins lol.  (I buy like 10$ worth of muffins weekly, although it's paid in cash with old tips from a previous fast food job so not actually in my budget)  \n\n\nI do have access to a kitchen, but there's a lot of stealing and it's fucking gross most of the time (There's like two girls on a floor of 40)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/1799r7s/best_appliance/", "created_utc": 1697472877.0, "score": 2, "author": "NukeNukedEarth", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/1799r7s/best_appliance/", "html_title": ""}

It's crazy and we stand to gain a lot beyond just the environmental benefits from solving this problem, including saving a good deal of money!  \n\nMy friends and I are building an app called [Budgeat](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts) aimed at addressing this issue. In developed countries households account for half of all food waste, so if we can make it easier to make the most of the food we bring home then we can make a big dent in the overall issue of food waste.  \n\nEnter [Budgeat](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts), the \"digital kitchen assistant\" we're building to help you find recipes, plan out meals, generate shopping lists, and track and fully utilize what's in your pantry. You can either use it to do full blown meal planning, or just enter a few items you already have that need to be used up to get a plethora of personalized ideas on how to use them. Even simple things like using the pantry to remind you when those perishable items need to be used up can make a big difference.  \n\nThe app is free and we're still early in our journey, so if you're so inclined we'd love it if you gave it a try and let us know what you think!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/16hm7z5/amp_up_your_collegecooking_while_helping_the/", "created_utc": 1694609452.0, "score": 1, "author": "budgeatapp", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/16hm7z5/amp_up_your_collegecooking_while_helping_the/", "html_title": ""}

I know some people who eat microwave frozen meals, they aren\u2019t my favorite but still better then nothing. I also like to get small russet potatoes and make cheesy potatoes. Really a lot of different options with this one too \n\nRice cooker : pretty straight forward. Rice can go with alot if different things i have it often. I have also made small proteins of Soup in mine. One of my Favorites meals is Tuna and Rice. I will even buy seaweed so i make make little like tuna roll type things\n\nElectric kettle: Boil eggs in the electric Kettle they are a good source of protein. You can also use this a for anything that requires boiling water. expect for Pasta i haven\u2019t done it before but i don\u2019t think it will work well. \n\nA Electric Stillet: This is allowed in the kitchen of my dorm, we don\u2019t have stove tops. you can really make anything with this one some of my favorites is fried eggs and Fried Rice. Grilled cheese i is an easy one \n\nA Crock Pot : i actually have alot of things i make in this. Easy thing to throw together the night before and cook during the day especially when your planning to stay in your dorm for most the day. \n\nFor Ingredients, i use the salad station for alot. We also have a Sandwich station. The side dishes at my school Arent always horrible so occasionally i grab things from there. If you don\u2019t want/ can\u2019t go to the store to shop insta cart works but they tend to up charge things. One of the easiest things to get is a rotisserie chicken then cut it up and use it to add to meals during the week.

{"title": "My take on meal prep.", "selftext": "**What is meal prep?**\n\nMeal prep is cooking food in advance. This could be by making extra of your dinner so you will have planned leftovers. Or it could be to the extreme of planning and cooking all of your meals for a week in advance. I personally have been meal prepping for about 2 years now, and I don\u2019t think I will ever not do it again since how much it helps during the week.\u00a0\n\n**Why Should I meal prep?**\n\nThe number one reason why you should meal prep is that it saves a ton of time. Instead of cooking 3 meals a day that takes about 30 minutes each, you can bear the burden of cooking for a few hours all at once, and then not have to worry about cooking for a while. All you have to do is heat your food up and you\u2019re set to go.\u00a0Another great benefit of meal prepping is that you can prepare healthy meals in advance. If you already have healthy meals made, you will be less tempted to stop for a fast-food burger or something else that you really don\u2019t want. You will be able to get a great meal, very quickly, and feel great about yourself afterward.\u00a0Meal prep is also a great way to save money. If you plan out all your meals, there is a small chance that you will have to waste much food in the process. Also, a lot of foods that go great meal prepping, can end up being super cheap while still tasting amazing,\n\n**Is meal prep for me?**\n\nIf you have a very busy lifestyle, are constantly on the go, or spend long days away from your house, meal prep will be great for you. As long as you have a few hours to sacrifice for cooking, you will do great preparing your meals. I know many people who work 9-5\u2019s who love meal prepping for the fact that they can just grab food quickly to take to work. And personally, as a college student love meal prepping because it allows me to grab food fast after class, and have more time for homework, and fun.\u00a0\n\n**What foods can I prep?**\n\nThere is a ton of food that you can prepare, you just have to be careful not to keep it in your fridge too long, or else it could go bad. Usually, the expiration of prepared food is about 5 days. This is usually how long I plan for, and I\u2019ve never had any problems with food going bad. Some of the best foods to prepare are:\n\nProteins:\n\n* Chicken\n* Ground Beef/ Turkey\n* Fish\n* Lentils\n\nCarbs:\n\n* Rice\n* Pasta\n* Vegetables (Steamed broccoli, carrots, chopped spinach, sweet potato, etc..)\n\nFats:\n\n* Olive oil (goes great with pasta)\n* Cheese\n\n**How do I start meal prepping?**\n\nThe best way to get started meal prepping is to just hop in and experiment. You will learn fast, and before you know it you\u2019ll be an expert, and you\u2019ll be eating healthy all week long without the extra stress of constantly cooking.

For black friday my parents have agreed to buy me another appliance I can use to cook from my dorm room (already have an air fryer).  \n\n\n I was wondering what would open be the best between a pressure cooker and a mini convection over/ bigger air fryer (that would replace the ninja foodi I have atm).  \n The oven would allow me to bake pasta/bread/snacks etc (the main drawback of the air fryer, the two zones make it impossible to cook something other than a cookie in it).   \n\n\nBUT the pressure cooker would allow me to make rice, soup, curries and chilis which would reduce my grocery bills (I currently eat a piece of meat + veggies cooked in the air fryer). Drawback of the pressure cooker is that I still can't bake and will likely end up buying a ton of muffins lol.  (I buy like 10$ worth of muffins weekly, although it's paid in cash with old tips from a previous fast food job so not actually in my budget)  \n\n\nI do have access to a kitchen, but there's a lot of stealing and it's fucking gross most of the time (There's like two girls on a floor of 40)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/1799r7s/best_appliance/", "created_utc": 1697472877.0, "score": 2, "author": "NukeNukedEarth", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/1799r7s/best_appliance/", "html_title": ""}

I know some people who eat microwave frozen meals, they aren\u2019t my favorite but still better then nothing. I also like to get small russet potatoes and make cheesy potatoes. Really a lot of different options with this one too \n\nRice cooker : pretty straight forward. Rice can go with alot if different things i have it often. I have also made small proteins of Soup in mine. One of my Favorites meals is Tuna and Rice. I will even buy seaweed so i make make little like tuna roll type things\n\nElectric kettle: Boil eggs in the electric Kettle they are a good source of protein. You can also use this a for anything that requires boiling water. expect for Pasta i haven\u2019t done it before but i don\u2019t think it will work well. \n\nA Electric Stillet: This is allowed in the kitchen of my dorm, we don\u2019t have stove tops. you can really make anything with this one some of my favorites is fried eggs and Fried Rice. Grilled cheese i is an easy one \n\nA Crock Pot : i actually have alot of things i make in this. Easy thing to throw together the night before and cook during the day especially when your planning to stay in your dorm for most the day. \n\nFor Ingredients, i use the salad station for alot. We also have a Sandwich station. The side dishes at my school Arent always horrible so occasionally i grab things from there. If you don\u2019t want/ can\u2019t go to the store to shop insta cart works but they tend to up charge things. One of the easiest things to get is a rotisserie chicken then cut it up and use it to add to meals during the week. Of you don\u2019t necessarily have alot of money to spend look and see if your school has a food pantry \n\nif you have any questions or want recipes lmk.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/112b086/how_i_dorm_cook/", "created_utc": 1676395799.0, "score": 1, "author": "Whit3devi1", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/112b086/how_i_dorm_cook/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My take on meal prep.", "selftext": "**What is meal prep?**\n\nMeal prep is cooking food in advance. This could be by making extra of your dinner so you will have planned leftovers. Or it could be to the extreme of planning and cooking all of your meals for a week in advance. I personally have been meal prepping for about 2 years now, and I don\u2019t think I will ever not do it again since how much it helps during the week.\u00a0\n\n**Why Should I meal prep?**\n\nThe number one reason why you should meal prep is that it saves a ton of time. Instead of cooking 3 meals a day that takes about 30 minutes each, you can bear the burden of cooking for a few hours all at once, and then not have to worry about cooking for a while. All you have to do is heat your food up and you\u2019re set to go.\u00a0Another great benefit of meal prepping is that you can prepare healthy meals in advance. If you already have healthy meals made, you will be less tempted to stop for a fast-food burger or something else that you really don\u2019t want. You will be able to get a great meal, very quickly, and feel great about yourself afterward.\u00a0Meal prep is also a great way to save money. If you plan out all your meals, there is a small chance that you will have to waste much food in the process. Also, a lot of foods that go great meal prepping, can end up being super cheap while still tasting amazing,\n\n**Is meal prep for me?**\n\nIf you have a very busy lifestyle, are constantly on the go, or spend long days away from your house, meal prep will be great for you. As long as you have a few hours to sacrifice for cooking, you will do great preparing your meals. I know many people who work 9-5\u2019s who love meal prepping for the fact that they can just grab food quickly to take to work. And personally, as a college student love meal prepping because it allows me to grab food fast after class, and have more time for homework, and fun.\u00a0\n\n**What foods can I prep?**\n\nThere is a ton of food that you can prepare, you just have to be careful not to keep it in your fridge too long, or else it could go bad. Usually, the expiration of prepared food is about 5 days. This is usually how long I plan for, and I\u2019ve never had any problems with food going bad. Some of the best foods to prepare are:\n\nProteins:\n\n* Chicken\n* Ground Beef/ Turkey\n* Fish\n* Lentils\n\nCarbs:\n\n* Rice\n* Pasta\n* Vegetables (Steamed broccoli, carrots, chopped spinach, sweet potato, etc..)\n\nFats:\n\n* Olive oil (goes great with pasta)\n* Cheese\n\n**How do I start meal prepping?**\n\nThe best way to get started meal prepping is to just hop in and experiment. You will learn fast, and before you know it you\u2019ll be an expert, and you\u2019ll be eating healthy all week long without the extra stress of constantly cooking.
