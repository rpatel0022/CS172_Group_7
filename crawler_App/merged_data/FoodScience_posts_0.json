{"title": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Food Science", "selftext": "What comes to your mind when you hear \u201cFood Science\u201d? Do you associate it with culinary arts? Biotechnology? Agriculture? While food science is partly related to them, it is actually also a discipline that stands remarkably on its own. For decades, it has helped business enterprises, scientific communities, and nations as a whole.\n\nThis field of study is constantly expanding, with many scientists contributing to this interesting area.\n\nToday, we will be talking about some of the fundamental things you should know about food science, especially if you\u2019re interested in pursuing your academics and career under the field.\n\nWe\u2019ll be outlining our discussion with three basic questions about food science: (1) what is Food Science? (and what is NOT Food Science?);\n\n(2) what are some Food Science Courses or subjects?; and\n\n(3) why does Food Science matter?\n\n## What is Food Science and what is NOT Food Science?\n\nLet\u2019s first establish some definitions so we can set a primary standard on what is food science.The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) defines food science as \u201c\u2026the study of the physical, biological, and chemical makeup of food; the causes of food deterioration; and the concepts underlying food processing\u201d. In simpler terms, it\u2019s the scientific study of food, its aspects, and how its quality can be improved through science and technology.\n\nThis gives food scientists and food technologists the role of applying principles from vast scientific disciplines to the study of food. The general end goal of food science is to improve the safety, nutrition, and availability of food, as well as improving humankind\u2019s overall health conditions.\n\nFood science is also an interdisciplinary area of study in which other sciences or fields (such as biochemistry, nutrition, biology, biotechnology, mathematics, physics, toxicology, engineering, psychology, genetics, and even law) come together to give a wider perspective on food science.\n\nAs you will later notice, many of the above mentioned subjects will appear as courses under food science degrees. Depending on your chosen area, you can design and implement models on your food research studies and other projects.\n\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned earlier, food science is often associated with other fields. While it uses an interdisciplinary approach in learning, you should also learn how to differentiate them. For example, food science is related to the culinary arts in a way that the latter uses principles from the former to improve the quality of their products. To illustrate, a lot of chefs use basic science knowledge on how particular food items or components are processed and how they can maximize the benefits they get from them. These are seen in a variety of food preparation or manufacturing techniques such as freeze-drying or decaffeination.\n\nThis area of study is also correlated with biotechnology, particularly on the processing of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Here, the foods\u2019 genetic components are altered to improve their quality. Many times, these modifications are done for a more efficient food manufacturing process and provide humankind with better and more sustainable alternatives to certain food items.\n\nStill, food science, biotechnology, and other mentioned areas of science are all separate disciplines with their own principles and methods and should not be considered one and the same.\n\n## What are some of the courses you will be taking under a Food Science degree?\n\nNow moving on to the next question, what are some of the subjects you will be learning under food science? Here are some of the most common subjects you should expect to study if you are to pursue a food science degree.\n\n### 1. Food Chemistry\n\nTo understand the chemical components of food in an in-depth manner, food scientists study food chemistry. They use their expertise to grasp the overall nature of the food items they\u2019re studying. With more information researched, they will be able to determine the best or most suited modifications in their food manufacturing process.\n\nOther related subjects include food analysis and biochemistry.\n\n### 2. Food Engineering\n\nFood engineering uses principles under the engineering field to study food. Expect that you will be using a lot of mathematical applications that can aid you in your research and experiments.\n\n### 3. Food Safety and Quality Assurance\n\nIn these subjects, you will be learning how to check and guarantee the manufacturing process of food items to be safe and be of good, and of high quality upon completion. This also involves complying with certain standards imposed by government institutions and other business enterprises.\n\n### 4. Product Development\n\nIn product development electives, you will be creating your own food products by using the knowledge you\u2019ve gained from your major courses. These lessons often feature a heavy concentration on hands-on training and experiences, as well as grounded projects.\n\n### 5. Food Law\n\nA bit similar to food safety and quality assurance, you will learn about the different rules and regulations established by the Food and Drug Administration, and other legal concerns you need to know when working on food manufacturing.\n\n## Why Food Science Matters\n\nNow onto our last question, why is food science important? Throughout the reading, we mention that food science\u2019s end goal is to make humankind\u2019s quality of life better through studying food. But what exactly has food science done for us (and will continue to do so)?\n\nThe IFT lists five (5) paradigms to highlight the importance of food science.\n\n### 1. Availability of Food\n\nFood science plays a crucial role in a world where there is an increasing population and a scarcity of resources. Food science includes developing methods to contribute scientific viable solutions to a massive global struggle. This is done by carefully studying food and creating models on how to efficiently produce food.\n\n### 2. Food Safety\n\nAs food scientists study food safety and quality assurance, they will also be finding ways on how to create safer food alternatives, especially in periods of scarcity where there are limited resources for food production.\n\n### 3. Food Sustainability\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to create food. It\u2019s another to certain a source. Food sustainability has been a long-time project for food scientists all over the world. After all, humankind\u2019s survival is of utmost importance.\n\n### 4. Nutrition\n\nFood science also aims to create more nutritional food alternatives to improve people\u2019s health. The nutritional aspect of food is a significant focus in food science.\n\n### 5. Special Foods\n\nSpecial foods are made for people with a variety of health conditions and require specific nutritional needs such as food for newborns, children, seniors, and diabetics.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/io3ff2/a_beginners_guide_to_food_science/", "created_utc": 1599465336.0, "score": 120, "author": "osauglobal", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/io3ff2/a_beginners_guide_to_food_science/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "A Humble Request from the Food Science Community", "selftext": "**Warning: A Long Message Lies Ahead**\n\n\u00a0- - -\n\nDear r/FoodScience Community,\n\nThank you all for your participation here, whether as an anonymous reader or as a contributor to the many questions on food science (as well as some that are not really food science\u2026) posed by others.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m Bryan Quoc Le and I am one of the moderators of r/FoodScience. I've been a member of the subreddit since 2017, when I joined in graduate school, and have been a moderator since 2021. For the past four years, I\u2019ve been building my food science [consulting business](https://www.bryanquocle.com/) to help food startups and companies, working remotely from home.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rewarding, and sometimes lonely, journey. But despite working alone, this subreddit has been a way for me to remain connected to the greater professional community. I\u2019ve been grateful to have a means to discuss and share food science topics with others here, learning from others with more experience and knowledge in subdomains. It\u2019s certainly one of the highlights of my days and has been immensely enriching for my professional life.\n\nLast month, my mother was struck by a vehicle while riding her bicycle and passed away. I have posted a [memorial](https://www.bryanquocle.com/kieuthitutrang) in her honor on my website for those interested in learning more about her life and the circumstances of her passing. Regardless, the situation has created many changes in my life and given me a reason to reflect on those aspects of my life that I believe are important. I\u2019ve had to sit down and think about what I want to do moving forward with my career, being reminded of the fleeting and ephemeral reality of life.\n\nEven before her passing, I had been feeling burned out by my consulting practice. I had a very serious legal and financial altercation with a client previously in the year that resulted in me questioning if I wanted to continue in this line of business, as a solo practitioner providing consultation for small businesses and startups. While my business has given me financial stability and has been rewarding in of itself, I find myself wanting to do more than just sending a formulation into the void, not knowing if the product succeeded or failed, or what ultimately happened to the company and the people involved in a project.\n\nI suppose what I mean to say is that I am hoping for something more durable, purposeful, and impactful than what I have been doing thus far. I recognize it\u2019s rather a privilege to be able to think about these sorts of values when financial survival is no longer on the table, but I am going to lean into it and accept that this is the next stage I am at in my life.\n\nMy wife and I plan to return to California, specifically the Bay Area, after living in Washington state for the past few years. These new circumstances have given me the opportunity to consider going back to school, something I have been wanting to do for quite some time. More than a decade ago, I was briefly a graduate student in two programs at Stanford University in their Department of Chemistry and the School of Medicine. At the time, I was feeling lost, but on a whim, decided to take up a few classes in the [Stanford design school (d.school)](https://dschool.stanford.edu/). That is where I learned a little more about the food industry, particular in a class on sketch design, where we broke down the design components of an orange.\n\nI only took a few weeks\u2019 worth of classes, but some chance encounters (for example, one of the faculty members in the School of Medicine brought me to meet [Dr. Pat Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O._Brown) at his office, the founder of Impossible Foods, while he was still faculty and raising funding on Sand Hill Road) led me to withdraw from my programs and consider focusing on the food industry as a career.\n\nNeedless to say, these series of serendipitous events set me up to pursue food science as an academic field, and eventually, my profession.\n\nSo now here\u2019s the ask. I\u2019m planning on re-applying to graduate school at Stanford to pursue a graduate degree in design at the d.school. I remember those classes were some of the most fun and exciting part of my time on that campus. And while I don\u2019t have a clear sense of what I plan to do with that program, I know there\u2019s something there involving the intersection of food, writing, design, entrepreneurship, and education.\n\nI don\u2019t have much in the way of a stable professional network; most of my client-based projects are rather short-lived. While I do have two potential recommenders for this program, I am seeking one more. So here's the unconventional ask. For anyone who has felt like I\u2019ve made some impact on their education through the r/FoodScience subreddit or felt I had made even a small contribution to the professional field through my time here and is inspired and willing to write a letter of recommendation, I would love to hear from you.

{"title": "Fascinating: Sugar can actually caramelize at temperatures below where it melts. Baking sugar at sub-melting temperatures gradually converts your sugar into caramel sugar (a.k.a. toasted sugar).", "selftext": "This is one of the more fascinating food science things I've learned in recent times:\n\nSugar apparently doesn't melt the way ice and metal and other phase-changing materials melt. Other substances have a defined melting point, and can re-solidify just as they were before by cooling down the materials. Sugar does not behave this way. It starts as a crystal, but re-solidifies as a sort of glass, because actually suffers thermal decomposition in the process of melting. At temperatures even below where it begins to melt, sugar can begin to experience this thermal decomposition and will caramelize at these temperatures. Also, caramel is apparently incredibly complex, and isn't just one substance, but is a mixture of thousands of substances, further evidence that thermal decomposition is going on. Gradually baking sugar to the point where it becomes caramel sugar gives you the complexity of caramel without the smokey bitter taste that comes from high heat caramelization processes. If you make caramel on the stove top, the traditional method involves heating sugar syrup until you see the barest hint of smoke, then arresting the process by quenching it with cream or simply taking it off the heat and pouring it into ramekins for flan. This method has a very narrow margin for error. Toasting sugar in the oven lets you gradually get to the point of perfect caramel without ever risking the production of smokey or burnt flavors.\n\nSerious Eats has this article on this, and a visual guide showing what happens to sugar when you bake it at 300\u02daF for one hour up to five hours, along with descriptions of what the resulting evolution of the flavors is like. It is worth reading if you want to understand the science of caramel better.\n\n# Serious Eats |  [Toasted Sugar Recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/dry-toasted-sugar-granulated-caramel-recipe)\n\n*Granulated caramel that can be used in any recipe as a one-to-one substitution for plain sugar.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/106dt7d/fascinating_sugar_can_actually_caramelize_at/", "created_utc": 1673165579.0, "score": 83, "author": "Berkamin", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/106dt7d/fascinating_sugar_can_actually_caramelize_at/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Data scientific approach to Ingredient pairing", "selftext": "I've been playing around with an ingredient pairing algorithm for some time, and would be curious to hear the food scientist take on whether it's scientifically solid and how it compares with your existing tools.\n\nShortly: I've index 130,000 online recipes from various online recipe sites (~200 different ones), standardized the ingredients into a 7000 item vocabulary and scored them based on the average review score.  Second, I took the averages of review scores for all combinations of two ingredients (i.e. recipes with both *garlic* and *lemon juice* on average got 4.48 stars). \n\nThen, to identify extraordinary ingredient pairs, I extracted out pairs where the 95% confidence interval around the review average excluded *both* ingredients in the pair on their own. So the combination must be better than either ingredient on their own, with a 95% certainty it's not random. \n\nIn addition, as online recipe review scores are questionable at best and often inflated either systematically or from lack of reviews, I standardized them around a \"global\" average. So a recipe on a site site with only 5-star reviews would be normalized to 4.28 stars, which was the global average. And in reverse, a recipe with 4.5 stars on a site with an average of 4.1 and a standard deviation of 0.2 would potentially look at a normalized score of 4.9 or 5. \n\nThe results [can be browsed here](https://www.dishdragon.ai/). Note that I'm not a designer and it's a garage project so it's accordingly wonky... But the data is as it's intended to be.

{"title": "I went to a test bakery for industrial breads, and have a couple of pictures to share!", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Breads with different enzymes](https://preview.redd.it/2fhqqkwygbt31.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df9e4d22651d9b83f95dce62e177f37ea0080886)\n\nHello all! I sell enzymes and emulsifiers for industrial bread making (and really many applications involving flour). A couple of months ago I went to the test bakery of the company I represent, and was able to participate in some of the tests they do. I thought you all might maybe find this interesting!\n\nThere are many enzymes that can be added to help bread properties, but to simplify, they either work with the starch, or with the gluten. All of them try to achieve something specific. In the example in the picture:\n\n* The first loaf only has some flour correctors, like ascorbic acid. All of that already comes with the purchased flour. This is the control sample.\n* The second loaf has alpha amylase added. This is the more commonly used enzyme in bread making. Amylases are naturally available in flour, and they help to break it down into sugars (food for the yeast). The more prevalent amylase in flour is beta amylase. This one has the alpha variety.\n* The third one has xylanases. They work with gluten. See, flour has impurities: solids calles pentosans that effectively work as needles when you create the gluten \"balloon\", therefore hindering gas retention. Xylanases work specifically to break down (some of) these solids. There are specific Xylanases for different type of pentosans.\n* N\u00ba 4 is a complete enzymatic mix containing additional ascorbic acid, alpha amylase, xylanase, glucose oyydase (needed because when xylanases break down the solids, they create free water. This is desired because more water = better oven spring. However, a very wet dough decreases machinability. Oxidative systems typically dry the dough, improving said machinability). There is also some lipases in the improver, this serves as an emulsifier. This is a basic -but complete-, mix for sandwich bread.\n\nI know the picture makes it look like the loafs on each side are wider, but that is not exactly true. They were all baked in similarly sized tins. It's just the angle of the picture. This next picture should at least show, not only the amount of tests we baked, but also that the size is a lot similar than what the above picture shows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is about 25&#37; of all the bread we baked that day!](https://preview.redd.it/5y7h0nl8hbt31.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=595be2ed0090c343c90e957a0b8dab65fca4aaf0)\n\nTo have a better view of exactly how the enzymes work, please see this last picture. In it it shows the left loaf, which is the control recipe, and the right loaf, which has the complete enzymatic mix. I think the increased volume is evident. But maybe you can also appreciate that the color of the crust is better in the right loaf. Also, that the color of the crumb is whiter (something that retailers continually ask for). I know you can't taste them, but the enzymes have no impact on the flavor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Visual influence of enzymes in tin bread](https://preview.redd.it/5ojl1i1dhbt31.jpg?width=3836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02da8ec434d6ce00a75c08e136e40ec54cf85939)\n\nThe recipe for both loafs is the same (except, clearly, the added enzymes), and it's a basic 57.5% hydration loaf (0.8% yeast and 1.5% salt, as is more and more typical in Europe). The total enzymes in the recipe add to 0.1% (everything, of course, by flour weight). The recipes are so much the same, that the mixing time is the same (controlled not by time, but by the revolutions of the industrial mixer). They are also fermented together (both bulk and second fermentation) for the same time, and baked together for the same time.\n\nAnyway, I'm fascinated by the science behind industrial bread making. I really hope that at least you found this post somewhat interesting, even if it talks about, well, supermarket bread!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/djp0c5/i_went_to_a_test_bakery_for_industrial_breads_and/", "created_utc": 1571412115.0, "score": 62, "author": "getmesomemangoes", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/djp0c5/i_went_to_a_test_bakery_for_industrial_breads_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Friendly reminder that shelf life doesn't mean 1 thing", "selftext": "When I work with my clients I commonly hear (even very educated long time food scientists) use the general term \"shelf life\". It's very common in our industry to say \"I want to extend my shelf life\". The problem with a lot of the posts and comments I see here is that non-food scientists use this term as a blanket and don't understand what it means.\n\n\nAt it's core, \"Shelf Life\" means generally 2 things:\n\n1.) \"Is it safe to eat\"\n\n2.) \"Do I want to eat it\"\n\n\nThe first (is it safe to eat) generally refers to a microbial shelf life. As in, \"if I eat this will I get sick\". The second (do I want to eat it) generally refers to sensory, organoleptic etc. As in, \"does this look/taste/feel like something I want to eat?\"\n\nBoth can be intertwined, but if one fails, generally your shelf life fails. \n\nExample: \"It's safe to eat, but I don't want to eat it.\" The product isn't microbially bad, but it's flavor is off. (Rancidity). One example we see of this is oxidation of fresh sausage. Usually, the color goes grey before the bacterial counts make it spoil. The consumer looks at the grey and says \"I don't want to eat that\" and doesn't buy it.\n\nExample 2: \"I want to eat it, but it's not safe\". IE the flavor, color and everything TASTES fine, but the bacterial counts make it bad. Spoilage organisms usually cause a negative sensory and people will not want to eat it. However, Listeria can be present at a level that can get you sick and you can notice no off flavor and enjoy the product, only to be sick after. \n\n\nSo when you ask people on here about shelf life it's incredibly complex. There are intrinsic and extrinsic factors.\n\nIntrinsic factors (think inside) are things like water activity, pH, nutrient content, redox potential etc.\n\nExtrinsic factors (think external) are things like temperature of storage, relative humidity, gaseous atmosphere, time, packaging etc. \n\n\nGood food scientists will get asked a question and reply \"it depends\". When I see this sub blow up with the most basic question and no information and someone reply with a definitive \"do this\" I think, this guy has no idea what's going on. \n\nI see \"Can you help me extend the shelf life of my meat snack\". and someone will reply \"yes add 0.5% vinegar\". It's mid boggling. Food safety is a very serious, very complex thing. If you don't know what you're doing you can kill someone. Giving bad advice to someone who doesn't know what they are doing and pretending to be an expert can get someone killed, hurt etc. Be careful when reading this sub and taking these \"experts\" opinion. \n\n\nIf you want to produce a product and can't afford to do it correctly, you certainly can't afford what happens next when you get someone sick.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1gizyv5/friendly_reminder_that_shelf_life_doesnt_mean_1/", "created_utc": 1730675155.0, "score": 57, "author": "fearthejet", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/1gizyv5/friendly_reminder_that_shelf_life_doesnt_mean_1/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

He discovered many of the modern laws associated with plant fertilization, as well as developing the first beef extracts and beef cubes.\n\nHe alludes to the idea of creating beef extracts and bouillon cubes in this text, after finding that inosinic acid, a breakdown product of DNA, produces beefy aromas after being heated in a platinum spoon.\n\nHis research also led him to find other elements of beef extract as necessary nutrients and flavor compounds.\n\nAlthough Liebig had previously discovered inosinic acid and it\u2019s potential role as a source of flavor in the mid 1800s, it wasn\u2019t until Japanese chemists would directly connect this compound to its ability to greatly enhance umami taste in savory and fermented foods in 1913.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ha68iz1urwi91.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd0d42cdb55825bd762d727e12418808018884c2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6oq67k1xrwi91.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2266677996901ee3235800fd62a9b34d1bbaa792\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8r3ohnyrwi91.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01384066bdb8e2cc38c850ac54b060fa05f33e51\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn7ivwyzrwi91.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80c9ab9b9b25b2d8e6ce6f35c063bc47bd32b2a9", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/wtdhpf/found_a_rare_copy_of_researches_on_the_chemistry/", "created_utc": 1661018796.0, "score": 41, "author": "UpSaltOS", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/wtdhpf/found_a_rare_copy_of_researches_on_the_chemistry/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "(Graphic Warning) Ortolan Cooking Method - Why?", "selftext": "Cross-posted from r/Cooking\n\n\nI was recently reading about all sorts of different delicacies around the world, and I came across the Ortolan from France. For those not aware, the bird is caught, fattened(they naturally gorge themselves when in a dark environment), then killed by drowning in Armagnac, given a prolonged marinade in the same liquid, then lastly roasted and feather plucked.\n\n\nI don't support inhumane slaughter methods(this is a dish I would personally never wish to consume knowing how the slaughter was performed), but I am not trying to have a conversation on ethics. For the purpose of this discussion, let's assume food flavor is all that matters, regardless of how you get there.\n\n\nWhat I want to know, from a flavor standpoint, why would drowning be any \"better\" of a cooking method than a more traditional slaughter followed by marinating the processed bird? Having raised and processed my own livestock, the happier the animal and the quicker/more painless the slaughter, the better quality and flavor of meat you will get in the end. I've read that this is largely due to stress/trauma related chemicals released in an animal that adversely affect flavor/texture. All that said, I would assume that death by drowning(furthermore, drowning in strong alcohol)would actually make the meat less desirable than if it were slaughtered humanely and then simply marinated.\n\n\nIf there is any insight to this, I would be curious to learn more.

{"title": "Leaving R&D - career options?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, looking for advice about potential career options as someone coming out of R&D. I currently work for a large food company doing Product Development and though I enjoy many aspects behind the job, I\u2019ve come to realize that a lot of the day-to-day tasks aren\u2019t something I foresee myself doing long-term. I enjoy the technical problem-solving and innovation but the majority of my daily tasks don\u2019t encompass these aspects. A lot of the job is also very physically taxing (eg. 12hr plant trials that start at 2am) and I can\u2019t imagine doing it as I get older. R&D is also paid the least out of every function at my company, and I would eventually like to transition into a higher paying role. \n\nI\u2019m wondering what roles other people have transferred to after starting their career in R&D with a BS in Food Science and if you have any advice for transitioning/making yourself a compelling candidate for new types of roles. What skills from R&D did you find most transferable to other roles? Some things I\u2019ve considered:\n- Consulting (ideally for a Food/Bev sector). Pros: higher pay, less physically taxing, technical background may help candidacy and expertise on the job. Cons: leaving food science, less technically rigorous, no business/consulting background, depending on company can be rough hours/work environment\n- Consumer insights: Pros: interesting field, can transition from R&D. Cons: less technical, uncertain about pay?\n- R&D at a start-up: Pros: may be more technically rigorous and interesting content. Cons: would likely have similar work environment/requirements. \n- Technical sales rep: Pros: get to utilize technical knowledge, commission? Cons: no business/sales background, I tend to be more introverted - might be hard with sales\n\nI\u2019m in the NYC/NJ area, currently working and living in NJ. I would love to live and work in the city but realize it is difficult with a lot of food companies. \n\nI love food science and the food industry, but am not tied to staying in food science R&D specifically. I would love to stay within the food/beverage industry, but am willing to explore different types of roles that are food/bev adjacent. \n\nSorry for the long post, just really interested in hearing other people\u2019s career paths and advice!

My BS was in Microbiology and I\u2019m currently 2 years into a Quality Assurance Technician position at a large beverage company. I\u2019m interviewing for a QA manufacturing development program that would essentially train me to follow the path of QA Tech -> QA Supervisor -> QA Manager for said company. But now I\u2019m not confident about continuing down this path anymore.\n\nI think the position is a great opportunity to learn and grown, but the quality manager path scares me. It looks to me like you would be on call 24/7 with only on-site job options and little flexibility. You\u2019re constantly the bad guy preventing production from running and I feel that Quality managers are constantly strong armed by other departments. Is this true? Are there any quality supervisors/managers out there who can tell me about pros/cons and about your experience at your manufacturing facility? Extra points if you\u2019re at a beverage facility as well!\n\nIf I were to move away from this path, what other related fields could I go into? Maybe regulatory or compliance? Has anyone made this transition and can tell me about your career path to get there? Are there any related fields which could work hybrid or remote?\n\nThank you all in advance!

Sadly, they are terribly expensive, and my attempts to recreate them at home have been resounding failures.  \n\nI reached out to the manufacturer, who could only state the cooking process involves \"some oil\" and that the cauliflower is \"low heat crisped.\"  The remainder of the cooking process is proprietary.\n\nThe bag states the cauliflower is cooked with \"just enough heat and pressure\" in order to preserve nutrients.  My initial assumption therefore was these snacks are prepared via pressure frying (KFC chicken style), though I would expect pressure frying would cause the cauliflower to brown (and for the most part, the florets are \"blonde\" or just slightly golden).  Another poster (in a separate subreddit/thread) suggested vacuum frying was a possibility.  I do not think the cauliflower is merely dehydrated; my experiments with dehydrating at different temps/times caused the florets to shrink and become chewy, rather than maintain their initial size and acquire crispiness.  Freeze drying was also considered, though there must also be a frying step at some point - these beauties are akin to potato chips in crunch and greasiness.\n\nMy biochemistry degree has proven useless in the food science sphere.

{"title": "The \"should I do this\" or \"Should I do that\" in school post", "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI love this subreddit! I really do. Food science is an amazing career path in my opinion and I see a lot of excited people trying to enter the field.\n\nWhile I'm not perfect, I've been in the industry for over 15 years and here's what I wish I knew going into the field!\n\n\n1.) The \"should I do this or that\" in school. The first question you should ask yourself is \"what do I want to DO\". The example I always use is myself and microbiology. I hated lab work, but it was necessary for me to use in my other side. So set yourself up with something class wise that gives you the CAPABILITY to do what you want after. \n\n2.) TALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS! Network network network and if that fails, network! With your professors, your peers, your everyone! Professors know people who can get you jobs. They also know what can help you achieve your goals. Get a good mentor if possible. Ask them what they think you should do to achieve your goals. Maybe they even know someone who can help. Your peers will be the people who you work in the industry with. I can tell you, food is HUGE but also SO SO SO small! You bump into the same people over and over. Also, most schools sorta specialize. Example: Some schools are very good at sensory. That means some of your peers will be in your same position at different companies so you have great resources for information and jobs elsewhere!\n\n3.) \"It comes at a cost\". Some of my peers took VERY easy course loads vs some of us over loaded on the science side. I can say confidently the people who took the harder work load ended up better set up (generally) to be successful after college. BUT DON'T PANIC! College teaches you what to say and in a way how to think (scientifically). A LOT of your learning is done AFTER college and on the job training. Everyone does things slightly different!\n\n4.) Intern if you can. Yea sometimes it sucks and you want that last bit of freedom, but a good internship can teach you a lot and open you up to job opportunities after.\n\n5.) If you do it, and you hate it, TRY TO MOVE ON! Maybe you thought you wanted to be a meat guy; turns out you hate it. Don't spend the next 5-10 years specializing in something you hate. Sometimes, taking a step back can be taking a few steps forward. At a young age and entry into the market and industry, don't be afraid to say \"I messed up and want to try something else\". Nothing is worse than forcing yourself into 30 years of work you hate because you're too scared to start over 2 years in. I've seen it both ways and boy does it suck the latter.\n\n\n6.) Attending trade shows is great... but interacting at them is worth 1000x more. Meet the people. Talk to the employees. We (most of the time) LOVE meeting new people. But avoid the sales reps there! Most of them are there to sell and hit a quota and will brush you off. Focus on the support staff or hiring people!\n\n\n7.) ASK! ASK! ASK! Don't be afraid to say \"that sounds interesting. Do you do internships? Are you hiring? How can I learn more?\" But my personal favorite that I think gets the best result is \"That's interesting, WHO can I talk to about that to get more information? Do they have a card or contact info?\"\n\n\nThe rest of you!

{"title": "Is R&D overrated?", "selftext": "For the longest time, I thought I wanted to be in R&D for my entire career. I graduated in food science, worked for 2-3 years in Product Development on new formulations, bench top work, label creation, specs, shelf-life, etc., before realizing it was not as exciting as I expected to be. It probably depends on the company, but I personally thought it would be a lot more scientific and creative.\n\nI felt like I did not really get to utilize my degree during my job. Most of the projects cared more about the profit than about the actual research and development (aka the science). New products were just the same as the previous ones with 1-2 ingredients changed. Any type of scientific study would be half-assed. Actual research data and scientific studies would be ignored. A Master's degree and research experience was not really valued enough. There was never \"enough money\" or funding to test out any scientific studies on products.\n\nAfter switching companies, I realized I would run into two different type of scenarios when it came to R&D: either too boring or too demanding. Even at other jobs, this ended up being a cycle. Either too much work, or too boring and not fulfilling enough.\n\nHere are the scenarios I encountered (at different companies):\n\n1. **Too boring (and unfulfilling)**: Many large companies use co-manufacturers. Most of the time, you don't even get to formulate new products or see them being created. You either get to revise what has already been formulated, or you only get to make small changes (add new flavors, try out new suppliers). Management and executives get to make the decision on what to launch. You don't have much control over anything.\n2. **Too demanding**: At smaller companies, formulation development is so demanding that you end up being burned out from it quickly. You try different formulations over and over again. They get rejected, so you start over again. You have long working hours, are unable to work from home. You basically put all of your tears, sweat and energy into a project just for someone to shut it down 2 minutes later.\n\nOf course, seeing your product getting launched is rewarding, but is it worth the mental exhaustion?\n\n**Maybe it's just a personal thing and R&D is not for me, or maybe it's the companies I worked at. But I'd like to know if anyone has had similar experiences. Or completely different ones. Please share with me.**\n\nRight now, I am just looking for a better work-life balance where I can 1) have access to remote work, and 2) continue to learn what I love (science). It seems like R&D is neither of those, at least in the Product Development aspect. So I am leaning more into the Research/Regulatory/Nutrition aspect of products.

{"title": "What would be the scientific reasons that it would be unsafe to sterilize beef (with sous vide) then dehydrate at 135 to make medium rare jerky? ", "selftext": "Sorry cross posting but somebody suggested I might get better answer here. \n\nI want to make medium rare jerky, but I not if it is unsafe. \n\nFrom a logic or science standpoint, why would it be inadvisable to sous vide beef to 135 to sterilize, marinate in a cooked, sterile marinade, then dehydrate at 135 or less to get medium rare jerky? \n\nI\u2019ve looked everywhere online for an answer, and don\u2019t get any answer other than the ultra conservative generic USDA jerky guidelines of 160 for beef and 165 for chicken, which don't consider the idea of pre sterilizing the meat. USDA, until recently, didn\u2019t even have sous vide guidelines. Even today, they recommend a conservative 145 or higher to sous vide solid meats (even though almost everyone uses 135 or lower, since people want since medium rare or cooler and 135 will kill your bacteria to safe levels if you follow the temperature time guidelines (the old 160 or 165 internal temperature guidelines were based on basically \"insta-kill\" temperature for bacteria).\n\nSo, typically jerky is prepared well done because uncooked meat starts out with bacteria on it, and  the only safe way to sterilize the meat while drying it with air is to use 160+ degree air.\n\nBut if we sous vide the meat to 135 for a couple hours for example, and sterilize/pasteurize the meat first at medium rare, then put in dehydrator at a 135 or lower (which is very capable of dehydrating the meat to jerky), we should have a process that gives us medium rare jerky that is just as safe and just as good a shelf life, as well done jerky. \n\nI'm no expert, just a lay person who is making a carefully considered argument, but seems like sterile, medium rare, dehydrated jerky meat might provide a better flavor, and should be no more subject to contamination than sterile, well done, dehydrated meat. \n\nThe lack of water and concentrated salt and sugar are the preservatives for jerky, not the doneness. If anything, the well done meat is predigested and potentially easier for bacteria to get a foothold on.\n\nAm I missing something? Is 135 degrees for a couple hours not enough? Would medium rare jerky not preserve as long?

{"title": "Umami Intensity Calculator", "selftext": "After almost three years, I finally found the time to finish a fun little side project I\u2019d been putting off:\n\nhttps://www.bryanquocle.com/uniko\n\nI\u2019ve always been really fascinated with the concept of umami ever since I learned about its quantitative nature in graduate school, and spent more time than I care to share reading many research papers on the topic. From a mound of articles I\u2019d been stashing away on my spare hard drive, I had this idea to piece together all of the equations involved with calculating umami taste.\n\nNot a novel concept, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s flavor software out there that will do it much better than I can.\n\nBut I was so curious to know more details about the umami intensity of the food I was eating. It was about figuring out why certain recipes work and others do not. I also wanted to see if I could cook based on first principles thinking, instead of relying on empirically-generated recipes or using up a ton of ingredients to experiment with variations directly.\n\nI never found anything that would do these types of calculations for free, where I could input a recipe and spit out the umami intensity. So I wanted to put together something lightweight and easy to use so I could do a little investigating on my own.\n\nI can\u2019t code worth anything, so I decided to put the equations together in Excel. Not the most elegant layout, but it helped that I didn\u2019t need to spend months (years?) learning Python or Java to play around with the synergistic taste interactions.\n\nI eventually pieced together a very rough draft, but other commitments demanded my time, so I pushed it off for a while before finally finishing the project in the last few weekends, after I\u2019d significantly sharpened my Excel skills over the years.\n\n(For example, in the old draft, I used a series of hundreds of copy-pasted IF functions, that took hours to manually cobble together and had many errors, instead of just XLOOKUP.\n\nYes, it was that bad, and yes, I was that much of an Excel newbie.)\n\nHere are a few assumptions I applied to this spreadsheet calculator for simplification:\n\n1. Other basic tastes, like sweet, sour, bitter, and saltiness, do not directly interact with umami. (Very bold assumption, but it simplifies the calculations).\n\n2. Chemical and enzymatic reactions don\u2019t interfere with the concentration of amino acids and nucleotides in the composition.\n\n3. All water available in ingredients is free and can dissolve all umami-enhancing solutes.\n\n4. Umami solutes are evenly distributed throughout the composition. (Again, another strong assumption that ignores the effects of gels, foams, proteins, and oil-water interfaces.)\n\n5. The Maillard reaction is not occurring during cooking, and so does not generate non-conventional nucleotide or amino acid derivatives that amplify umami.\n\nIf I ever get around to doing more with this project, hopefully I\u2019ll be able to incorporate some more calculations and adjustment factors to account for the above.\n\nI\u2019ll plan on tinkering around with applying the calculator to certain applications, like comparing recipes for their umami intensity, seeing how additional ingredients impact the overall flavor of a pre-existing recipe, and determining trends in ingredient usage across several recipes.\n\nIn any case, enjoy and feel free to share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/19894ii/umami_intensity_calculator/", "created_utc": 1705427694.0, "score": 29, "author": "UpSaltOS", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/19894ii/umami_intensity_calculator/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Because of this, I wasn\u2019t able to gain any work experience during my degree (no internships, no student jobs). So I wasn\u2019t able to find out in practice whether this field is really right for me. After graduating, I didn\u2019t immediately start a master\u2019s because I was completely exhausted and burned out\u2014I needed time to breathe. Plus, I wasn\u2019t sure if food science was even the right field for me. Many master\u2019s programs are very research-heavy and highly specialized, and I wasn\u2019t sure if that was the right fit for me.\n\nFor over a year now, I\u2019ve been applying for various positions in the food industry that match my qualifications and would allow me to gain a foothold in the field\u2014but so far, I\u2019ve only received rejections. I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a vicious cycle: no experience \u2192 no opportunities \u2192 no way to gain experience and move forward. Looking back, I can see what I should have done differently during my bachelor\u2019s, but that doesn\u2019t help me now. At this point, I have no idea which  industry or job would even suit me.\n\nI then enrolled in a distance-learning master\u2019s in business administration for scientists, hoping to gain some business knowledge, explore new opportunities, and improve my chances of getting an internship or student job. But now, I\u2019ve run into a different set of problems (For context, I\u2019m based in Germany): Many companies only offer internships to students whose programs require them, which is not the case for my master\u2019s. And getting a student job is difficult as well, since many companies prefer to hire interns first before offering them a student position. So in the end, this master\u2019s hasn\u2019t helped me much in that regard.\n\nI\u2019ve also consulted career advisors, both at the job center and privately, but unfortunately, that hasn\u2019t brought me much closer to a solution.\n\nI\u2019m not lazy or unmotivated\u2014in fact, I\u2019m hardworking, ambitious, and eager to contribute to something that truly fits me. But that\u2019s exactly the problem: I have no clear idea where I should go professionally. Everything feels like a dead end, and no matter what I try, it leads nowhere. I feel completely lost, unsure of what\u2019s realistic or how to make good use of my potential.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation after gaining a degree in food science or has an advice on how to break out of this uncertainty? Should I just go for a food science master\u2019s, even though I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m truly interested in it or if it will help me?

{"title": "What is the difference between a Vulnerability assessment and Risk assessment?", "selftext": "A customer emailed this question to me last week and I thought it was worth sharing the answer, because it can be a bit confusing. \n\nFrom Emilia: \u201cWhat is the difference between a Vulnerability assessment and Risk assessment? Are they considered to be two different documents?\u201d\n\nA vulnerability assessment and a risk assessment are done on different topics (eg. Risk assessment for food safety, vulnerability assessment for food fraud or intentional adulteration). You would not do both a risk assessment and a vulnerability assessment on the same topic. The resulting documents look pretty much the same as far as I am concerned. It\u2019s mostly just about the language/words. \n\nA vulnerability assessment is slightly different to a risk assessment; risk is something that has occurred before and will occur again, it can be quantified using existing data.  A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by someone or something who wishes to profit or intends harm.  A vulnerability can lead to a risk.  Because food fraud is difficult to estimate and quantify, we use the word vulnerability rather than risk.  In addition, using the word \u2018vulnerability\u2019 helps to minimise confusion in the food industry where risk assessments for food safety are commonly performed and well understood.\n\nIf you want to learn more about vulnerability assessments for food fraud or intentional adulteration, check out this step-by-step guide:  [https://www.foodfraudadvisors.com/food-vulnerability-assessment-how/](https://www.foodfraudadvisors.com/food-vulnerability-assessment-how/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/ddxtre/what_is_the_difference_between_a_vulnerability/", "created_utc": 1570331654.0, "score": 26, "author": "karenconstable4", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/ddxtre/what_is_the_difference_between_a_vulnerability/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "What constitutes a high quality food science education?", "selftext": "I'm studying food science at the only university in my country that teaches it. Since day one I've felt that the quality of the course materials was very lacking, being mainly just powerpoint slides without any supplementary reading material. Studying for final exams is usually exclusively cramming powerpoint slides, because there is no other course material. If there is any assigned reading material it's there in name only and not referenced in any way, leading to us students having to resort to book piracy instead of risking purchasing expensive books that aren't even used as course material. I've gotten pretty good grades, but I genuinely feel like I'm not going to become a qualified food scientist even though I put in my absolute best and find reading material on my own when there is none assigned.\n\nIt's a very small department, with very few students and very few teachers. Some of the teachers are stretched so thin that they don't even seem to have time to teach at all. The head of the department, who is a professor for 11 courses, even forgot to start one of her six-week courses on time (food engineering), so that it began two weeks later than scheduled.\n\nI wrote a letter to the department last year about how disappointed I'd been with the quality of the course material but I was told that they are unable to find material that supplements what they want to teach in the courses, so they need write their own material. By \"writing their own material\", they seem to mean creating powerpoint slides that do not stand alone without the lectures. Then due to the professors being spread thin, they hire graduate teaching assistants to read the slides out loud for us. These are courses like preservation operations, food physics, food engineering, food microbiology, food chemistry and food analysis. Sensory evaluation is the one course that seemed thoroughly good.\n\nMy department falls under the School of Health Sciences, but the department has had to commission several courses from the School of Engineering and Natural Sciences, since there are so few students in food science that they can't afford to teach their own courses on these subjects. These include general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, mathematics and statistics. These courses are all *very* high quality and challenging and I'm very happy with these courses even though my grades aren't as high in those courses as in the powerpoint-cramming courses.\n\nAnyway, feeling kind of hopeless. I guess I just wanted to ask what your experience is. How would you describe a high quality food science education?

My first thought is that it's undercooked, but if you forcibly \\(and I mean forcibly\\) pull the chicken apart, there are micro\\-striations, and I don't think undercooked chicken has these.

I am by no means the type of person that wants to endure some sort of atomic heat wings challenge, but I do generally really enjoy \u2018normally\u2019 spicy foods.\n\nOver the past few years I have noticed that the bowel irritation (diarrhea, tenesmus, fiery anus, etc.) I get from eating certain spicy foods does not at all correlate with the perceived level of heat/pain when I eat them. I\u2019ve been able to narrow this down to a couple of particularly irritating foods: fast food spicy chicken (chickfila, popeyes, etc.) and jalape\u00f1os. Now, in my opinion, jalape\u00f1os have the potential to be pretty damn spicy when eating them - and I generally do not like the particular type of spice they have anyways - but I get the dreaded side effects kind of regardless of the spiciness of the jalape\u00f1os. What\u2019s crazier to me is that chickfila spicy chicken is relatively mild in spiciness but wow do those destroy my gut. When I cook with peppers, I usually use either serranos or hungarian wax peppers and I do not have any problems with these, regardless of how spicy the food I make it.\n\n I\u2019ve looked around the literature and found one [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814609011145) comparing capsciacin, dihydrocapsciacin and nordihydrocapsciacin content, and there wasn\u2019t much a difference in the profiles of jalape\u00f1os vs. serranos. So my questions for all of you are 1) do any of you experience anything similar? and 2) does anyone know anything about the capsciacinoid profiles of different pepper varieties and how this might relate to undesirable side effects? I'm just trying to nail down the cause of this phenomenon - and I think that if anyone knows the specific ingredient (maybe its synthetic or an extract of a specific variety of pepper?) used for fast food spicy chicken that could be a good start too. \n\nThanks for entertaining this ridiculous question - any input is appreciated :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/ms6e0i/capsciacinoids_in_different_pepper_varieties_and/", "created_utc": 1618589232.0, "score": 20, "author": "pigtowndandy", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/ms6e0i/capsciacinoids_in_different_pepper_varieties_and/", "html_title": ""}

While I am a relatively intelligent person that can problem-solve effectively and follow instructions pretty well, I don't know shit about food science outside of baking. \n\nIf it IS something I can do by following instructions that would be great, except I can't find anything online about what the process is. It's also totally possible that I'm just not equipped to comprehend what may be instructional or that I don't know the proper terminology to research. The goal is to find a pH buffer for non-carbonated, non-alcoholic beverages that has an inconsequential effect on taste and consistency, as well as info on what to do with it (how much water to dissolve it in, what temp, other questions I wouldn't know to ask...)\n\nWhat say you, scientists?? Can I do this just by utilizing the kindness of knowledgeable strangers, or do I need to tell my boss that we have to outsource to the pros??\n\n\n\nEDIT: First of all I want to thank everyone for being so responsive, I'm more of a reader than a poster so I wasn't expecting so much info! To answer a few questions, the pH generally tends to be ~4.1-4.2 on day one, 4.3 on day two. The reason we're doing this is because we've recently had issues with the tea carbonating after a couple of weeks, sometimes earlier. It's a chai concentrate so there's a considerable amount of sugar and fresh ginger in addition to the spices, which I'm sure plays a role in the fragility of its shelf life. Still carbonation seems weird to me, I know what fermentation typically tastes like but was def not expecting it to suddenly be fizzy. It's also totally possible the problem is something that could be more easily corrected using some other method, I'm only looking into pH balancing because it's the task I was given. I'll discuss the thread with the boss and will likely have more to say after that!

Normally I just buy the Target-brand Oat Milk but as a bit of a quarantine time-waster I've been trying to reverse engineer it to make it myself.\n\nOat Milk itself is pretty easy. Most recipes I've found call for 1 part oats to 3-4 parts water, blend, and then strain. Easy enough, and the result is reasonably close in consistency and taste. A small amount of canola oil also helps.\n\nHowever - it does not froth when used with my espresso machine, whereas the store bought stuff does. Possibly related, the homemade stuff causes the steam wand to scream like a banshee when submerged vs the store bought which does not.

Can you guys provide any insight on if I'm at all on the right track, and perhaps what some more consumer-available food surfactants would be? If I'm totally off base, what might I be missing?\n\nPS - I've seen at least one recipe out there that claims success by using cashews with the oats.

{"title": "A really simple suggestion for students/new grads (or anyone in food)", "selftext": "I've been suggesting this to students I meet at food industry events and thought I'd share it here for anyone interested. There are two really simple things you can do to learn more about the food industry beyond your education. They are:\n\n1) Sign up for used equipment auction email alerts. These emails come ~1-2 times a week and often have pricing for aftermarket processing equipment. It's a great way to get familiar with the cost of different machines and understand what equipment is in circulation. A lot of FS programs (in my opinion), don't focus enough on engineering and don't do enough review on associated costs. A few months on these emails will give you an idea of what things cost and this is great information to know in an interview or any practical setting. You can sign up to www.labx.com or www.aaronequipment.com or many others.\n\n2) Sign up for food recall alerts from FDA or your local food safety agency.

{"title": "Ask FoodScience: How to create a suckable lozenge without sugar?", "selftext": "So, as you may or may not have heard, Progresso has been trying to play Willy Wonka and created Soup Drops which are seemingly impossible to get. And, motherfuckers, I want some goddam meal gum, ideally without blueberrification, with a touch of everlasting gobstopper. Soon as I heard about these stupid things, I needed them. But they were sold out. And this morning, they restocked and then the site was down for a goddam hour and it just came back up and the DB was dead and now it's fully back and they're fully sold out and I WANT TO DIE.\n\nBut I have resolved to make my own soup drops. As it so happens, I was already canning a huge batch of veal stock this morning (like ya do) and didn't have quite enough to fill that 7th jar to the ideal one-inch headroom, so I've got some stock I've got to use. But how to get it into lozenge form? \n\nObviously, you don't want your soup to be overly sweet. I'm toying with the idea of just reducing the veal stock down to a near demiglace in hopes that the sheer concentration of flavor will overpower whatever sugar is needed to get it into a candied state. But having some experience with food chemisty (calcic and alginate pearlization, tapioca maltodextrin fat powders, etc), I'm wondering what else is out there that could potentially get me a suckable soup drop. \n\nGranted, I don't know what the actual Progresso Soup Drop is like; if it's a hard-candy like I imagine, or something more akin to a gummy; if there's a liquid center or hard all the way through. But I figure I'll shoot for hard candy, and make compromises where required. \n\nIf I were going for suckable gummies, I'm THINKING just large amount of agar agar, gelatin, maybe xanthum gum? in the right ratios could get me there. Keeping in mind there's already a significant amount of gelatin in the veal stock (it was nice and jiggly after cooling in the fridge). \n\nBut what else is out there? What ingredients or chemicals can hit that suckable hard-candy texture without adding additional sweetness? Help me achieve my everlasting soupstopper dreams!

I have an unrelated bachelors degree with some basic biology coursework, I\u2019ve taken gen chem but not organic chem. I\u2019ve worked in foodservice and consider myself a relatively good home cook but I\u2019m definitely not a chef. I mostly cook standard midwestern U.S. style food and I\u2019m relatively familiar with most cuisines you will find in North America. I\u2019ve had some exposure to Indian and North African cooking styles but that\u2019s about it culturally. I am alright when it comes to baking, I understand using recipes with baker\u2019s percentages and the mechanics of leavening agents. I\u2019ve worked with sourdough but that is the extent of my work with fermentation (except for watching youtube videos).          \n           \n           \n             \n          \nI don\u2019t want to take the time to get a degree in food science so I\u2019d prefer books or webcourses.

When I graduated with my BSc in FS, I wasn't sure which career direction I wanted to take yet & ended in QA at a candy/dietary supplement company. The work was rough, but I had a good team and manager. I felt that I was growing and learning a lot, with steady promotions. But almost 3 years into the job, there were major changes in management & leadership. I was offered the chance to become a QA supervisor, but the pressure was too overwhelming and the responsibility to constantly hold the quality whip was exhausting, so I ended up leaving the company. I've had 2 other jobs in QA since then, but I feel like I've reached a bottleneck. I'm reluctant to enter the management level of QA because while I can probably be good at it, deep down I realized this career does not align with my personality.\n\nAnd so now, nearly 6 years into my career; I've decided that product development may be a better match for me. Food is still my passion, and the excitement of discovering the science behind it is what attracted me to study this topic in the first place.

{"title": "I feel really lost in my schooling and career path. Desperately need advice.", "selftext": "Ok, this is a long one but I need guidance and advice. I have pretty bad anxiety that results in decisional paralysis and commitment issues. When I started college in 2015, I had a really hard time choosing a major and career path. I'm very artistic and creative which is probably my greatest strength. I also do love food. I would classify myself as intelligent but not overly brainy or amazing at problem solving. I kept changing my mind and pushing off jumping too deeply into any one field. Each semester I kind of avoided taking any classes that didn't pertain to multiple major paths. I kept bouncing between things but eventually settled on Nutrition and Dietetics. However, in the back of mind, I didn't want to be a dietitian because of the poor pay. I also didn't think it was impressive or \"different enough\" since I have a people pleasing complex and I want everyone to think I'm just so super duper cool and unique \\*eye roll\\*. For the nutrition major, I was required to take intro science classes so Intro to Chem, Intro to Bio, Intro to biochem, Intro to microbio etc. These classes didn't go too deeply into the sciences and related a lot to nutrition. No math, no physics.\n\nFast-forward to graduation and I'm kind of in a panic and regretting not going into a design field or honestly any other field because I have commitment anxiety. I decided I would go into food science because hey, that's cool and I feel like I would enjoy the work and be able to be creative and yay food! Plus, it relates to nutrition so it seemed perfect. Remember, I only have a basic intro to science background. I live in NY and schools like Rutgers and Cornell were really far and required pre-reqs I didn't have. Plus, I was pregnant at the time with my now 19 month old son. So, I chose to apply to an online masters program at Kansas State University for a masters in food science. They checked over my classes from my undergrad and waived a few requirements since it was COVID and admitted me.\n\nI'm now a year and a half into the program and I have no idea what's flying. It seems like all my classmates are already well-versed in food science and deep into the field. They all know way more that me and I feel like an imposter. I'm lost during my lectures and the online quizzes are so tough on me that I have to google many answers. Without google, I probably would have flunked out. The topics seem interesting but I'm just lost. I don't know what to do with myself at this point. I'm regretting this field but also can't fathom dropping all that I've invested already and starting over. I'm a mom and life is busy but I do want to start working and make money and going back for more school seems daunting. I feel like I've made mistakes in this pathway and I just feel like no one would ever hire me.

{"title": "Question about storing homemade limoncello undiluted", "selftext": "So I just came back from a trip to the costa amalfitana, where limoncello originated from. In order to make some myself, I bought some really nice lemons there. However, amalfi lemons are twice as big as regular ones, so I accidentally ended up with far more lemons than I intended.\n\nI was reading around about how long homemade limoncello lasts before losing flavor, and in most places I read that its good for about a year. As limoncello has 30% alcohol per liter, it doesn't really spoil; however, lemon oil begins to \"unmix\" from the alcohol. (Limoncello is originally made with 90% alcohol, which is an alcohol concentration high enough to extract the oil from lemon zests. As limoncello is diluted to a drinkable 30%, the alcohol concentration becomes low enough for the oils to slowly diffuse again, thus losing flavor after a while.)\n\nSo I was thinking: if limoncello starts to go bad due to the alcohol content being too low to keep the oils integrated in the limoncello, can I just make a big batch of 90% limoncello now and store it long-term without diluting it? If I store some of the undiluted limoncello, and then dilute a bottle of it after say a year or two, will it still taste the same? Can anyone help me here?\n\nThanks in advance!

I wouldn't mind working in the field as a research scientist, but I want to be able to keep my options open after I grad with a PhD. My questions are:\n\n1. How much would my career prospects be narrowed after getting a PhD? let's say I take a PhD in plant protein synthesis, would I be, firstly, narrowing my career prospects to only the meat industry, and secondly, only narrowing it down to research fields? Regarding the first matter, I am curious if lets say I took a PhD in plant proteins, and I just wanted to find a job in a application technologist for beverages, will it work out? Just a totally different field in food.\n2. How much value is held for a PhD in the industry? I come from a small country in Singapore, and I am looking to NOT migrate, unless absolutely necessary.

This was long ago before Trump ran for office. What's funny is that the whole bit by Ali G (who is a comedian) was about ice cream melting too quickly (a legit food science problem). Ironically, Trump guesses the right solution (or approach) with drip proof ice cream, but they both pass it over, in favor of Ali G's ice cream glove. Obviously almost no one wants ice cream that is so hard that it never melts. But the idea of increasing its melting resistance so it melts more slowly in certain cases is an actual issue.\n\nFrom my rudimentary understanding of the issue, ice cream and its melting resistance can be addressed with emulsifiers/thickeners (carboxymethyl cellulose).

Unfortunately, the company I currently work at does not make it easy to switch departments and due to the politics of the company, it's pretty much frowned upon to ask for job/title changes.\n\nSo if I were to make a career change to a position in marketing (but staying in food/beverage), what's the best way to do it? Any advice?\n\nAny help is much appreciated.

I've made it many times and the recipe has always worked -- except today.\n\nThis time, I used Pecorino cheese that I had frozen and thawed, and it ended up as a greasy clumpy mess.

I've recently had an opportunity to make homemade cherry and blackcurrant syrup for someone who saw a post I made showing off my skills. Then it got me thinking, if there's a market for syrups, why not sell homemade product ? I make many flavors for personal use at home, like cherry, blackcurrant, cinnamon & mint, ginger, pear, and a bunch more. But if I want to consider it as a small business, I need to get serious about the science behind it. Best method for extracting flavors from certain fruits, temperature, sugar ratios, and the like. For example, my research led me to the knowledge that the threshold for a shelf stable syrup is a density of 1.3 g/ml. (warning : sorry for the imperial system folks oit there) And since when sugar melts it's volume becomes 0.53X, then for 1L of water you would need 850g  for a shelf stable product, to prevent mold in the short-medium term. And other basic information to craft liqueur recipes. But if I want to do this, I need more knowledge. Like using sodium benzoate as a preservative so I can make low sugar syrup.\nI'm not even sure how much sense I'm making here.

{"title": "Uniko - Umami Calculator - Update v.2.0.0 (Incorporation of saltiness as a taste property)", "selftext": "The Uniko spreadsheet has now been updated to include saltiness as a taste property, as well as link the relationship between sodium ions (as a proxy for saltiness) and umami intensity.\n\nIn this new version, I also removed the individual contributions of each ingredient on umami. They seemed a little more difficult to read and did not add much new information while I was evaluating recipes.\n\nThis is the first quantitative relationship incorporated into the spreadsheet that links two separate tastes together. The hope is that it will help provide better insight into the culinary theory that palatability is more of a balance of different aspects of taste, rather than maximizing only a few tastes over others.\n\nOnce other tastes are linked (sweetness, sourness, kokumi), I think there will be some valuable insights that can come into the foreground as far as how ingredients are combined and what makes for a palatable dish.\n\nIn this case, there is a sweet spot where just enough saltiness optimizes the perception of umami, sitting somewhere at 0.1 M (approximately 5.8% NaCl w/w in water). Too little or too much and umami perception is severely inhibited.\n\nIn future iterations, I will include a relationship between potassium ions and umami as well. At the moment, I'm only using sodium because the relationships between sodium and potassium, and their impact on umami, are complex. Both ions modulate the effects of glutamate as well as inosinate and guanylate on umami receptors, and their effects are not equal.\n\nPotassium also has a complex taste effect in which low concentrations are perceived as bitter/metallic and are only perceived as salty once concentrations exceed certain thresholds.\n\nI am currently ignoring the effects of counter-ions and assuming all are chloride. While phosphates and acetates diminish the effect of sodium and potassium on umami, there is little information from the literature or nutrition panels on their concentration in foods.\n\nOther assumptions:\n\n\\- Kokumi compounds do not affect umami intensity (this will be updated in later versions, I'm still trying to figure out how to best quantify the amplification of savory flavor when kokumi compounds \\[i.e. glutathione, cysteine sulfoxides\\] are incorporated in a dish).\n\n\\- Data relating sodium/potassium ions to umami intensity are from studies on [canine umami receptors](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.1994.266.3.R944). We assume here that they are sufficiently similar to human umami receptors.\n\n\\- pH has no effect on umami intensity (again, a gross simplification as acidic foods are known to greatly inhibit umami perception, which will be changed in later versions once I figure out how to calculate pH on multiple acid/base species in a complex mixture containing multiple protein buffers).\n\nFor the new version of Uniko, please visit below for the free download.\n\nFeel free to modify, explore, and share:\n\n[https://www.bryanquocle.com/uniko](https://www.bryanquocle.com/uniko)\n\nEDIT: Okay, I decided to just sit down and spend some time linking kokumi as well. So now there is a kokumi value on the dashboard, which is also now linked to saltiness and umami.\n\nHigher kokumi values increase the 'kokumi' perception, which in turn will enhance umami and saltiness, up to a threshold once kokumi compounds exceed the threshold concentration.\n\nApproximately 0.08% and 0.2% w/w of glutathione and cysteine sulfoxides (amino acids found in onion, garlic, and other alliums), respectively, will hit the maximum counter on the kokumi enhancement.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1b2blfz/uniko_umami_calculator_update_v200_incorporation/", "created_utc": 1709140873.0, "score": 16, "author": "UpSaltOS", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/1b2blfz/uniko_umami_calculator_update_v200_incorporation/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Oat Milk: Recipe questions and even more questions about fermentation", "selftext": "Hello!Just signed up to enter this subreddit after I read a few things about the process of making oat milk and feeling that some of you could potentially help me with some issues I am currently stuck with. I am very grateful about any help and all the people participating in this subreddit which I enjoy reading very much. Thank you!\n\nLittle background information: I am an agricultural student from Germany currently working on my master thesis. As part of the thesis, I am trying to develop a recipe for a basic oat milk. So far I am confident that I am able to produce a tasty oat milk. The recipe includes sunflower lecithin and alpha-amylase as well as rolled oats, meaning not unprocessed oat-kernels. The oat milk is good, people like it, but I am not 100% happy with the use of lecithin, alpha-amylase and rolled oats. If I could, I would be very happy to get rid of these ingredients as they are not used in most of the industrial-produced oat milk you can buy. Of course in my lab I cannot use the equipment the industry uses, but I will try and work on the exclusion/exchange of these 3 ingredients (which is totally optional, at this point just a personal preference of mine). I also tried malting oat-kernels, which definitely improved the taste and texture compared to unmalted oat kernels, but its by far not as good as the recipe with added alpha-amylase.\n\nHere is my best recipe for a basic oat milk so far, I am sharing it so you get an idea of what I am doing. I am using a Vitamix TNC5200 as a blender.\n\n* 50g rolled oats\n* 550 ml water\n* blend at 75% power for about 10 seconds.\n* 1ml alpha-amylase ([link to the product](https://www.c-schliessmann.de/media/spezifikation_amylase_ga_500.pdf), sorry, only in German. It\u00b4s alpha-amylase dereived from *Aspergillus niger* and has an GAU/g (amylolytic activity) of 500)\n* heat to 45\u00b0C\n* rest in towels for 30min, stirr every 10min\n* heat to 66\u00b0C\n* cool down to 20\u00b0C\n* blend mixture at 75% power for 30s\n* filter through sieve and \"nut-milk bag\" (a bag made out of hemp-fibers, I also tried using stainless-steal mesh with 0.075mm and 0.125mm mesh size, it filters a little bit more stuff out, but not to much)\n* you now have about 460-ish gramms of the oat base\n* add 1g of lecithin powder, 1g salt and 5g of oil\n* blend all together at low speed until homogenized for about 90s\n\nThis is the basic and best recipe I have so far, I made some improvements to the amounts of ingredients, but in general the recipe is unchanged.\n\nOkay, so far so good. That is one \"problem\". The other, bigger challenge for me is, that I\u00b4d like to develop an oat milk concentrate. Meaning a concentrated liquid to which water is added to get a traditional oat milk. So far I am not really able to produce this concentrate. I tried simply reducing the amount of water in the recipe, but filtration and handling the product is not easy, and extraction is very inefficient. Also it tastes different. Simply drying or evaporating the oat milk is not an option, because its very energy consuming and the reason this concentrate is developed is to save energy in production as well as transportation. Of course I know about the numerous powders of oat milk you can buy. But in my opinion this is not really oat milk. Producers often simply sell hydrolised oat flour and declare it as oat milk. The taste and texture differs a lot from all the products I have used so far. Also drying is very energy intensive as mentioned before.\n\nAt the moment I fell a little bit stuck. I read dozens of patents from oatly, numerous papers from scientiests about oat milk, watched many youtube videos and read a lot about fermentation etc, but for a few weeks I am not making any progress. This is why I am reaching out to this subreddit.\n\nIs there anybody, with an idea or any kind of guidance? I would be very grateful for any comment. Thank you very much for your time :)\n\nRegards,\n\nmue-sli", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/n90r66/oat_milk_recipe_questions_and_even_more_questions/", "created_utc": 1620640583.0, "score": 16, "author": "mue-sli", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/n90r66/oat_milk_recipe_questions_and_even_more_questions/", "html_title": ""}

I never used to have to be careful about it, it'd just come out right without thinking. But now? I feel like an idiot because I can't make what's effectively baby food.\n\nI only use whole milk.\n\nI've tried tempering the milk first.I've tried mixing cream in.I've tried cooking it as slowly as possible.\n\nI know covid has made supplies for everything suck. is campbell's just using shitty high acidity tomatoes that are just too acidic to not curdle any dairy I put into it?\n\nI've done a decent bit of research into this issue, looked up solutions and tried a ton of them to no consistent avail. I've tried testing if it has something to do with what store I get the soup or milk at, but that seems inconclusive at best. My mom made cheese when I lived with her, so I at least understand at least the vague basics of what dairy does when it curdles.\n\nThe only things I haven't tried are adding baking soda (ew, no, I dont want my food to taste like a 2nd grader's volcano science project, thanks) or a starch. But. Again. I don't feel like I should have to go to this trouble when this is something that for my /entire life/ has never been a problem until now.\n\nDid I suddenly start doing something wrong?? Is there some kind of contaminant that could be in my cookware that's causing it to curdle like this?? Or am I just screwed bc of some increase in the Ph of the product itself? I just want some soup, man...\n\nUPDATE: Okay, so I did a few small batches, letting it sit on low temp. Came out alright!\n\nI decide to try to make a bigger batch so I can feed more than a single person with a single bowl? Curdled, sitting on the stove at the \"3\" setting on this ball-and-chain of a 40 year old electric range my apartment has. Even with constant whisking, the soup on the top of the pot was still barely lukewarm, but as I noticed a few curds floating to the top, I knew it was too late and just pitched the whole thing. The entire bottom of the pot was coated with tiny curds, like it usually is when it goes badly.\n\nI'm seriously wondering if this is in part due to how inconsistent the heat from a cheap electric range is :( I'm going to just accept that this is how this stuff reacts now and just start adding base if I can... Guess I'll go see if that works.  \n\n\nUPDATE 2: yep, the soda has done it! no real notable change to taste, at least that I'm aware of. Alas, for my wasted batch of soup, but I think it really was just as simple as adding soda. Try new things and overcome your apprehensions. What's the worst that happens, you fail in a different way?

I am having trouble finding a recipe that explains the use of the different sugars and how they will change the texture and shelf life.\n\nFor the CBD portion of the gummy I am considering making either an infused corn syrup, or adding infused coconut oil.\n\nI will edit later and see if I can get the recipe that he has been using to see if that will help.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nEDIT: I have contacted TIC gums and found a great organic recipe to use!

{"title": "Should I start in QA for experience or go straight to R&D?", "selftext": "Hi guys! First post ever on Reddit. Hopefully you all can help me out.\n\nI graduated about a year ago with a Food Science B.A.S. that preps you to become a Culinologist. It was more R&D focused. I also got a B.S. in Nutrition/Business at the same time that I thought might be helpful in my career and during my job search. This degree taught the basics of nutrition and some basic business courses. Accounting, management, marketing, etc. Not a dietician focused degree by any means.\n\nI recently have been offered two jobs. One is for a FSQA associate position at a plant. While the other is for a sort of R&D position at a marketing company the official title is \u201cProduct Researcher\u201d.\n\nThe FSQA associate role would obviously be QA focused and not R&D. However this place has an R&D department I could transfer to later down the line.\n\nWhile the product researcher position would be more R&D focused. But it wouldn\u2019t be in a plant, rather a smaller lab. This job would have me trying out recipes, helping adjust cooking directions on products already available to the market, provide product specs to clients for said products, etc. They basically do research on products for clients such as grocery stores. \n\nWhat do you think would be more beneficial for someone who ultimately wants to get into R&D? Getting some QA and plant experience first, or going straight into something R&D related? \n\nThe FSQA job is about 20 minutes closer than the other job. Pay is similar. I\u2019ll be making $1 more at the product researcher job. However, the FSQA position does have profit sharing every quarter. Additionally, they give you paid holidays off and some other benefits the product researcher job wouldn\u2019t.\n\nBoth are also smaller companies. Nothing like PepsiCo, Cargill, etc.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the input guys! I think I\u2019m going to take the product researcher position. It\u2019s sort of a dead end job within the company. But I think after everything you all mentioned. It will make it easier to get another R&D job with a different company with that experience.

{"title": "Soy milk curdles when used in espresso drinks.", "selftext": "Recently we started making our own soy milk using a nut milk machine and the results have been great. We mainly did this because soy milk has been one of those products that are seeing supply chain problems and it's been hard to come by, but we also drink a lot of it so there's a lot of carton waste. The homemade version we make uses soy/cashew milk, a pinch of salt, a 1/4 tsp of vanilla, and a tbsp of agave syrup.\n\nMy question is about the science of so-called \"barista blends\" and how plain soy milk curdles when you mix it with espresso. There is a chemical reaction that happens almost instantly, unrelated to the steaming of the milk. You can confirm this by tasting the espresso, then the steamed milk, then combining them and tasting a sour, bitter flavor. This does not happen with barista blends.\n\nPacific Barista blend uses these ingredients:\n\n>Organic Soybase (Water, Whole Organic Soybeans), Cane Sugar, Contains 1% Or Less Of Carrageenan, Dipotassium Phosphate, Expeller-Pressed Canola Oil, Natural Flavor, Sea Salt, Sodium Citrate.\n\nI'm trying to understand which of these ingredients could be preventing their blend from curdling when coming into contact with acidic liquids like espresso.\n\nFrom what I understand, potassium phosphate is a salt, carrageenan is just for thickening, and the natural flavor is likely vanillin. That leaves the canola oil. If we tried this, how much should we add for a 20 oz batch? Does this make sense chemically?\n\nAnyway, there's a pandemic and I never baked any bread so here we are.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/sgj2qe/soy_milk_curdles_when_used_in_espresso_drinks/", "created_utc": 1643577077.0, "score": 15, "author": "Al_Redditor", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/sgj2qe/soy_milk_curdles_when_used_in_espresso_drinks/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Regretting a Career Move (R&D) - Seeking Advice", "selftext": "Hi r/foodscience community,\n\nI recently made a job transition to a new company and am having a bit of a dilemma. I'm afraid that I made a poor move and wanted to see if anyone would be able to give me some advice.\n\nThe previous smaller company I worked for (my first R&D role outside of college) was very hands on. I became very used to developing products at the bench top and brought many items up to commercialization in the plant. The company was fairly small and I was worried that I wasn't growing enough professionally. The work itself was varied and overall very interesting; however decisions made on the management side caused me to seek another job.\n\nFast forward to now, I am about a week into my new position with a larger size company that focuses on retail products. From what I have gathered from the other food scientists here, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of bench top work involved in development. Most of their products seem to use a generic \"base\" and are only differentiated by the flavor added. For brand new items, I'm getting the sense that the suppliers do most of the actual development work. It seems like the scientists are available more for inputting formulas and sorting through ingredient documentation. Cost seems to be much larger of a priority over finished product flavor which is not something I'm completely used to.\n\nI'm finding myself a bit disappointed so far. I transitioned to a new job for more professional growth opportunities but I'm afraid that I'm missing out on the creativity and science involved in product development which are my favorite parts of food science! Is this lack of bench top work normal in the food industry? Is this common for certain product categories or for bigger companies?\n\nHas anyone ever made a job transition that they regretted? What kind of advice do you have? I left my previous position on very good terms - I'm even considering asking for my old job back although I'm not sure if that's a wise move.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight you can provide :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/qwcoms/regretting_a_career_move_rd_seeking_advice/", "created_utc": 1637194024.0, "score": 14, "author": "jean_bean", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/qwcoms/regretting_a_career_move_rd_seeking_advice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

In order to have a variety of items in our stall, I bought a brand new Spaceman soft-serve machine to have that as an option, as well. \n\nI figured that I could figure out the machine. \"I'm smart!\" I told myself, not believing my own words. \n\nI've been working with a local dairy farmer for the last several years for the pops, and the bakery that I also own. We decided to use their ice cream base as a soft-serve base, because 1) it's delicious and 2) it's local and that's a thing I'm obnoxious about. Because it's an ice-cream base, the fat content is super high - around 18%. From my understanding, soft-serve base needs to be significantly lower in fat, which is why we're cutting it with skim milk (1 quart skim to 1 gallon ice cream base).\n\nBecause the agitators in the hopper spin frequently, and the scrapers in the cylinder are constantly scraping the walls of the cylinder to move the soft serve, we're consistently getting a gritty/sandy soft serve. The first few pulls are GREAT. An absolute delight. Delicious. But if none gets pulled every 20 minutes or so, it starts to get grainy and weird. \n\nI hope we'll have a steady flow of folks in here for us to keep moving the soft serve through the cylinders, but who knows. \n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated!

There doesn't seem to be a stable in between phase like butter where it's very malleable.\n\nHowever, the flavour is pretty great, and happy with where it's at.\n\nI've experimented previously with the main fat being shea butter or cocoa butter, but found the current recipe the best version so far to work with in pastry.\n\n**Ingredients (in Baker's percentage):**\n\n*Butter*\n\n* Shortening = 100%\n\n* Coconut oil = 20%\n\n* Canola oil = 20%\n\n* Salt = 2%\n\n* Xanthan gum = 2%\n\n* Soy lecithin = 4%\n\n* Butter Milk = 20%\n\n*Butter Milk*\n\n* Soy Milk = 100%\n\n* Coconut Vinegar = 3%\n\n* Apple Cider Vinegar = 3%\n\nThis ends up being around 83% fat; which was what I was aiming for to be similar to butter thats suitable for baking / pastry.\n\n**Method**\n\n0. Prepare butter milk, let it rest\n1. Heat up shortening till completely melted (~80C)\n2. Mix together shortening with other oils\n3. Wait till temperature goes down to ~60C\n4. Mix together with soy lecithin in vitamix\n5. Mix (gradually increase speed to 5) for 5 minutes, occasionally scrapping down the sides\n6. Add in salt, xanthan gum & butter milk\n7. Mix for a further 5 minutes, similar to step #5\n8. Move mixture from vitamix to a bowl, over an ice bath\n9. Continue mixing over the ice bath until down to ~30C\n10. Freeze for an hour, then move to the fridge for later use\n\nThe shortening is made from hydrogenated coconut oil which is meant to be stable at 36C. I am unsure if I am actually destroying this stability during the process from heating / cooling; but it does actually seem better than my original coconut oil only recipe.. so maybe that's still working :D\n\nIs there anything fundamentally _wrong_ with my current method or ingredients? Is that the best I can do at home basically?\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/mgql9a/vegan_butter_plasticity/", "created_utc": 1617140011.0, "score": 15, "author": "ledbA", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/mgql9a/vegan_butter_plasticity/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "trying to reverse engineer vegan shrimp", "selftext": "Hey, everyone. I'm looking for help with reverse engineering vegan shrimp. I am by no means a food scientist, which is probably why I'm failing pretty miserably.\n\nI've done a bunch of research on vegan shrimp, and what I've found is that the common link between virtually **all** vegan shrimp products is [konjac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konjac). I bought some online, and I also bought pickling lime (calcium hydroxide) which is supposed to help[1][2]. However, there are other ingredients found in vegan shrimp products, and some don't use pickling lime. I've compiled a list of the products I've been looking at, along with ingredients that I think might affect the texture:\n\n**Products without pickling lime:**\n\n[Vegetarian Plus vegan shrimp](http://vegetarian-plus.com/product/vegan-shrimp/)\n\n* Curdlan Gum\n* Modified tapioca starch\n* Potato Starch\n* Soy Protein Powder\n* Sea Tangle Extract\n* Yeast Extract Powder\n\n[Vegan King Prawn](http://vegecyber.com/cgi-bin/vege_item.cgi?detail=10416)\n\n* Curdlan from starch (same as Curdlan gum, I assume)\n* Starch (not sure what kind?)\n\n[Loving Hut vegan shrimp](https://lovinghutsupply.com/product/ocean-fresh/)\n\n* Soy protein\n* Tapioca Starch\n* Red yeast rice extract\n* Potato starch\n\n**Products *with* pickling lime:**\n\n[May Wah vegan shrimp](http://www.maywahnyc.com/Vegan_Red_Spot_Shrimps_L_p/a017l.htm)\n\n* Beta Glucan\n* Modified Potato Starch\n* Carrageenan\n* Alginate\n\n[Sophie's Kitchen vegan shrimp](http://sophieskitchen.com/shrimp/ )\n\n* Potato starch\n* Beta glucan\n* Pea starch\n* Alginate (from seaweed)\n\n[Chinese-branded vegan shrimp](https://www.itsveganbutisitgood.com/single-post/2017/12/12/Vegan-Shrimp-)\n\n* Thickening agents (not sure what this includes)\n* Quality improver E401 (alginate)\n\n**From this, I make the following observations:**\n\n* If you don't use pickling lime, you may need curdlan gum. This seems to be a bit difficult to buy, and I'm not sure how I'd use it with konjac.\n* If you don't use pickling lime or curdlan gum, you may need soy protein? I've actually got no idea how Loving Hut made a vegan shrimp *with* konjac *without* curdlan or pickling lime, since those seem pretty essential. Makes me wonder if it's mislabeled.\n* If you use pickling lime, you may need alginate. I could buy this, but again, I'm not sure how I'd use it with konjac.\n* If you use pickling lime, you may need beta glucan. This, like curdlan gum, seems a bit difficult to get your hands on, and yet again, I have no idea how I would use it.\n* In general, some kind of starch may be needed. I've actually tried adding tapioca starch and corn starch in a few experiments, but they've completely destroyed the konjac/water paste. I'm not sure if it makes a difference *when* I add it, however.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n* Does it matter that my corn starch and tapioca starch aren't \"modified?\" What exactly do modified starches do differently?\n* Does it make sense that I'd need alginate if I'm going the pickling lime route? If so, any ideas on how to use it?\n* I see carrageenan being used in one of the products. I know they're pretty different, but could I perhaps use xanthan gum and/or agar for any of this, since I already have those?\n* Semi-off topic: how is it that so many companies are seemingly able to replicate shrimp independently of one another with what I consider to be obscure ingredients like konjac and pickling lime? I've never really seen these ingredients used anywhere else. Is this just that easy for food scientists?\n* Does anyone have any idea how to do this?! Hah.\n\nApologies for the long post. I just want to help anyone help me as much as possible. Any insight you can provide would be immensely helpful, and I hope you find this as interesting as I do!\n\nNote: From what I've been told by lots of non-vegans, the texture of vegan shrimp (from multiple restaurants, none of which make it themselves AFAIK) is very convincing, so if you've never had it, you can assume we're just trying to replicate the texture of actual shrimp.\n\nThanks!\n\n[[1] How to make konjaku](http://samurai-kitchen.info/how-to-make-konjaku-konnnyaku/)\n\n[[2] Homemade shirataki noodles using Glucomannan powder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVsKmlMUZA8)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/9xniw0/trying_to_reverse_engineer_vegan_shrimp/", "created_utc": 1542384776.0, "score": 14, "author": "GRardB", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/9xniw0/trying_to_reverse_engineer_vegan_shrimp/", "html_title": ""}

I found a [slide deck (page 35)](https://lubbock.tamu.edu/files/2017/12/Galactomannan-and-Guar-Seed-Abidi-Aug2017.pdf) stating that with a .5M solution of sulfuric acid, good results can be achieved by boiling for three hours.\n\nThis is my current plan: \n- Use 37g citric acid powder, 13g sucrose, and 20g of guar gum per cup of water where 1 cup is 237 ml. The sucrose is there because I\u2019d like to also liberate its glucose. \n- Use iodine to test the starch level in a sample of the solution.\n- Test pH and add more citric acid if necessary. \n- Boil this solution for a long time, maybe start with three hours. I\u2019d like to use the instant pot so I can forget about it, but that\u2019s maybe not a good idea for my first attempt. \n- Periodically test pH and starch level. \n- Stop after either I don\u2019t feel like watching it anymore or the guar gum seems to have been sufficiently broken down via a visual assessment of the viscosity and/or the iodine test. \n- Use calcium carbonate to neutralize the solution, which should produce water, carbon dioxide, and calcium citrate. \n\nMy goal is to end up with sugar water that contains about the same amount of galactose (and also glucose) as milk would have. I expect to end up with some fructose and mannose, too, but that would be okay. \n\nAny thoughts on methods? Suggestions for improvements? I know that citric acid can\u2019t achieve the same pH as the sulfuric acid, so should I heat it for longer or maybe add more guar gum? Having leftover guar gum is not an issue. Also open to other ideas for getting galactose from a nondairy source. \n\nI did see a previous post that suggested using beta mannanase for creating partially hydrolyzed guar gum, but that\u2019s a little different from what I\u2019m trying to do. \n\nEdit: oops, I know it\u2019s guar gum, not \u201cgaur\u201d gum.

{"title": "The facts behind rice safety and food poisoning", "selftext": "It's probably a well-trodden subject, but it's a subject that's very difficult to ask about without getting a load of alarmist responses, warnings, superstition and horror stories. It's not a question for cooking forums I've found.\n\nSo here's how I best understand why rice is dangerous:\n\n-In raw rice, there are fungal spores.\n\n-These spores can survive being boiled (I have trouble believing this bit, but I've read it enough times to accept it)\n\n-When cooked rice is left at the right (wrong) temperature these spores then grow and produce poison.\n\n-It's this poison that makes us ill.\n\nHave I got it right so far?\n\nIt all raises a few questions for me. So for starters is rice safety largely about avoiding the poisonous by-product of a fungus? Is there a bacterial side to it? Can infection be passed on?\n\nAnd my biggest question. Nobody seems to bat an eyelid (if you'll pardon the clich\u00e9) about soaking raw rice at room temperature for long periods. Recipes suggest it all the time. No one seems bothered. Surely the spores are going to have a field day, and grow, produce their poison and the poison will then be present in the final product.\n\nAnd what about Dosa batter for making Dosas and Idlis? That's basically ground rice soaked left for very long periods in warm temperatures. Surely if all the above is true then that too is very dangerous? Yet there are no stories of people getting ill from cooked Idlis or Dosas?\n\nAny sage, level-headed comment would be appreciated. I'm not looking to be less safe, I follow all the precautions and still will do. I just want to understand exactly why.\n\nI suppose also as a side question I'm interested generally in the science behind food poisoning. Is food poisoning strictly poisoning from the by-products of fungus and bacteria, not necessarily infection by said nasties? I've never really found a solid answer as to why animals don't get sick from carrion, other than they are more picky than we think, from experience they can tell what's deadly from smell, and the fact that they're quicker to evacuate their stomach contents if they think something's up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/15be693/the_facts_behind_rice_safety_and_food_poisoning/", "created_utc": 1690493494.0, "score": 15, "author": "shabelsky22", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/15be693/the_facts_behind_rice_safety_and_food_poisoning/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I have a lot of questions about paprika extract", "selftext": "I originally posted this on r/askculinary but I think my inquiry might have been too technical? I'm still so curious! Anyway:\n\nMy whole life I've read ingredients on everything I eat. Not because I'm health conscious (I eat like shit) but because I love finding out how food is made.\n\nSo I noticed in the past couple years especially that *everything* even vaguely red now has paprika extract in it. Sometimes \"extractives of paprika\" or sometimes \"paprika oleoresin\" but I think it's the same thing: paprika acting as a coloring agent rather than a flavor. For example I went to go buy chips at the bodega and both of them (Utz Red Hot Chips and Cheddar Sunchips) have it. But it's not just trash food; I've definitely seen more upscale things contain it as well.\n\nI don't keep up with food science, but I remember growing up there was a lot more cochineal red dye. I'm wondering if the paprika extract is like safer or healthier? Or did those bugs get more expensive?\n\nCost is actually what first caused me to wonder about paprika extract: my understanding of paprika is that it's a specific kind of pepper that's been sun dried and ground up. I'm not sure what the extraction process is, but paprika production alone seems prohibitively expensive\u2014way too involved to be the main colorant in 50 cent bodega chips. Is paprika something else on an industrial scale? Why not just call it like, \"pepper extract\" or something?\n\nFinally, in my very strange work-avoiding knowledge quest, I googled \"paprika extract\" and found a bunch of Alibaba type sites selling wholesale quantities of what is *billed* as paprika extract but if you read more, it actually is something called \"Monascus Red Pigment.\" Monascus, it turns out, is a fungus mostly found in Asia that produces bright red pigments and is much cheaper. This led me to find this article: [*Adulteration of beetroot red and paprika extract based food colorant with Monascus red pigments*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956713519302282). Which, of course, led me to theorizing that a lot of what is listed as \"paprika extract\" is actually this mislabeled Monascus pigment. Is such a thing even possible? Like what is the process to test each individual ingredient to prove it is what they say it is?\n\nSo, TL;DR (sorry!)\n\n1. Why is paprika extract currently the red dye of choice?\n2. What even is paprika extract?\n3. How expensive is paprika extract to make?\n4. Is it possible paprika extract is this other thing?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/tsl1x8/i_have_a_lot_of_questions_about_paprika_extract/", "created_utc": 1648679346.0, "score": 15, "author": "theworstvacationever", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/tsl1x8/i_have_a_lot_of_questions_about_paprika_extract/", "html_title": ""}

The 00 dough was perfect, and the semolina was too wet. But they all had the exact same ratio of liquid to flour.\n\nI did some reading and saw something about how different flours absorb different amounts of water. I\u2019m guessing this is what caused the difference. Can anyone explain why that is? Also is there any reference that shows the water absorption of different types of flour? \n\nDoes how finely a flour is ground affect water absorption at all? In this case the 00 was ground very fine and the semolina was coarse.\n\nI also took into consideration that the dough with semolina used 60g water while the other two used 60g of eggs. Since an egg is about 75% water, does that mean that in equal amounts by weight of water and eggs, the eggs will hydrate flour 25% less?

After that I put the broccoli in a food processor and gradually add back like half of the resverved water. This results in a drastic change in color. It looks brighter, it more vivid, if that makes sense. (this trick is due to Gordon Ramsay) \n\nI don't know if this is a common trick, so just in case the whole world was doing it this way all along, I would like to add that my original recipe cooks the broccoli, discards some of the water and blends it and in both cases I add double cream at the end.\n\nI can't figure out what makes the difference. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/b5ukt1/why_does_drying_the_broccoli_after_cooking_it/", "created_utc": 1553630952.0, "score": 14, "author": "butyrospermumparkii", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/b5ukt1/why_does_drying_the_broccoli_after_cooking_it/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Is Escoffier's description of the molecular processes taking place in making a brown roux scientifically accurate?", "selftext": "I am currently reading Escoffier's Guide to Modern Cookery (1910) and came across this passage:\n\n>It is very important that brown roux should not be cooked too rapidly. As a matter of fact, among the various constituent elements of flour, the starch alone acts as the cohering principle. This starch is contained in little cells, which tightly constrain it, but which are sufficiently porous to permit the percolation of liquid and fatty substances. Under the influence of moderate heat and the infiltered butter, the cells burst through the swelling of the starch, and the latter thereupon completely combines with the butter to form a mass capable of absorbing six times its own weight of liquid when cooked. When the cooking takes place with a very high initial heat the starch gets burned within its shrivelled cells, and swelling is then possible only in those parts which have been least burned. The cohering principle is thus destroyed, and double or treble the quantity of roux becomes necessary in order to obtain the required consistency. But this excess of roux in the sauce chokes it up without binding it, and prevents it from despumating or becoming clear. At the same time, the cellulose and the burnt starch lend a bitterness to the sauce of which no subsequent treatment can rid it. From the above it follows that, starch being the only one from among the different constituents of flour which really effects the coherence of sauces, there would be considerable advantage in preparing roux either from a pure form of it, or from substances with kindred properties, such as fecula, arrow root, &c. It is only habit that causes flour to be still used as the cohering element of roux, and, indeed, the hour is not so far distant when the advantages of the changes I propose will be better understood\u2014changes which have been already recommended by Favre in his dictionary.\n\nIs Escoffier's description of what happens when roux is made with flour correct, seeing that this was written more than a century ago, and is pure starch the better substrate for a roux?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/128jg5s/is_escoffiers_description_of_the_molecular/", "created_utc": 1680348370.0, "score": 14, "author": "None", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/128jg5s/is_escoffiers_description_of_the_molecular/", "html_title": ""}

It\u2019s taken me several months to finally make a post here)\n\nI\u2019m an international student getting my masters (Food Science) in the West (not the coast) and hoping to graduate in April!\n\nI graduated from my undergrad in food science in April 2020. I was originally planning on doing an internship that summer but the international office would not allow us to do one due to covid. \n\nI talked to my advisor (has been my boss since 2018) and he suggested me moving my start date to April. It kinda worked out that way because I was able to take classes that are only offered every other year.\n\nI spent the first summer taking classes and doing preliminary data for my research and other side projects. The next 2 semesters I had to prioritize my classes over my research because international students had to (by law) take 9 credits (still made some preliminary data). Last summer (2021) I spent the entire summer doing all of my experiments and other projects. I finished my data analysis in Sep and right when I thought I could fully focus on writing my thesis I realized I made a major mistake in my experiments in the summer so I had to redo the entire thing which significantly pushed everything back.\n\nI spent probably 400 hours in one month to finish everything and the same time I passed my last course too. Even though I\u2019m glad that I don\u2019t have any classes to take this semester, I still have to TA for a class that has tons of stuff to grade on a weekly basis besides all the writing I have to do before I graduate. And on top of those responsibilities, I\u2019m at a stage where I need to and have to figure out the next chapter of my life\u2014finding a job, and that includes fixing my resume, job hunting, rejection, interviews. \n\nFriends who have graduated from the program recently told me that the job market right now is HOT but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to help me with my situation when I don\u2019t have ANY industry experiences other than tons of research experiences I have accumulated since I was an undergrad. I have never done any internships, and I feel like that puts me on an awkward spot\u2014not competitive enough compared to others and I also don\u2019t know what kind of jobs I can do/like to do.\n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE bacteria and that\u2019s basically what my research is. \nTook an R&D class as an undergrad but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the way it was taught or the product I was working with and also covid, I did not really enjoy it that much. \nHonestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m opposed to do R&D at all since I have no clue what it\u2019s really like. \nMy advisor had worked in the industry for almost 20 years prior to teaching and has a lot of connections but I don\u2019t know how much help I could get from him in these 4 months because he has 2 classes to teach and has to help me with my paper. He keeps telling me that he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll have any problems landing a job because he sees so much potential in me and the fact he has witnessed my tremendous growth since 2018. I thank him for that but the reality is that I don\u2019t have much experience in anything especially after seeing all all the job description saying \u201c3+ years experience\u201d. \n\nRules for international students are complicated. Our job has to be related to our degree. Preferably we want to work for a company that can sponsor our work visa in the future and sadly not a lot of companies do that. I\u2019ve thought about doing an internship first but we\u2019re only given 90 days of unemployment days which is riskier to me if for some reason I don\u2019t end up getting hired by the same employer. \n\nI\u2019ve read through all career related posts here but I couldn\u2019t find anything that\u2019s both recent enough and anything that was posted by an international student. \n\nQuestions:\nIs the job market in the food industry really that hot right now?\nWhat kind of jobs are in high demand?\nWhat is the market like in the West?

That being said I counted out a 30g serving which ended up being about 100 beans (100.5) and I spilt the 30g serving in half and counted 49.5 beans. So this SHOULD be about half a serving containing half the nutrients of a full serving. I counted out and cooked around 50 beans of frozen  edamame, which came out to be 46 grams shelled. That being said it was still around 50 beans. So am I missing something where the drying process somehow ADDS nutrients. Is it the boiling that does that and if so I'm I fine to simply eat the dried ones (they are more cost effective, being 2.99 per bag with 4 servings). I'm just very confused how boiling would REMOVE fiber. Or how the bags have different listed nutrition for the same product.

My high school GPA wasn\u2019t great due to COVID and mental health struggles, but I worked hard to turn things around in my senior year and during community college.\n\nMy dream is to work in food science and R&D (like developing new food products, flavors, or processes), and eventually get a master\u2019s degree in food science. The issue is that Washington doesn\u2019t have many schools with strong food science programs. I applied to WSU and UW Seattle, and got into both:\n\t\u2022\tWSU (Pullman) offers an IFT-certified food science program that\u2019s directly aligned with my career goals. The downside is it\u2019s 7 hours away from home, and I\u2019m super close with my old dog and my family. I\u2019m also nervous about being far from my support system since I\u2019ve never lived away from home, and I\u2019d likely have to live in the dorms since I can\u2019t afford an apartment right now.\n\t\u2022\tUW Seattle is a highly respected school, close to home (I could live at home and save money, stay with my dog, and have my parents nearby). It also has better networking and higher average salaries for graduates. The catch is \u2014 they don\u2019t have a food science major, just a \u201cFood Systems, Nutrition, and Health\u201d program which seems more nutrition-focused, not technical food science or R&D. I\u2019m not sure if going here would hurt my chances when applying for competitive food science master\u2019s programs later, since most students will likely have food science-related undergrad degrees.\n\nI also thought about taking another year at community college to save money, work, and take transferable science courses like chemistry and biology (since my AA didn\u2019t include many science classes), then applying to out-of-state schools like Purdue, UIUC, or UC Davis \u2014 but I\u2019m worried about delaying graduation, financial strain, and losing momentum.\n\nMy biggest priorities are:\n\t\u2022\tPreparing for a future in R&D food science\n\t\u2022\tBeing financially responsible\n\t\u2022\tStaying mentally healthy and close to my support system\n\t\u2022\tNot falling behind compared to others going into the same field\n\nIf anyone\u2019s been in a similar situation or has advice on how to weigh these options, I\u2019d be super grateful to hear it.\n\nShould I prioritize staying home with a slightly less aligned major and save money, or go far away to WSU for the exact program I want but take on more emotional/financial strain?

I made a couple of loaf cakes from them in the past week though. The cake (and glaze) I made yesterday used a lot more zest than the previous one, and every time I taste it, I get a numb sort of feeling in my mouth. I do not have any known food allergies, however I do have a sensitivity to high concentrations of formaldehyde. (migraine trigger)\n\nI am in the US and the pomelo I used yesterday came from Trader Joe\u2019s. (I recognize the pomelo may not be of US origin ofc.) It was much, much fresher than the one I used last week which had dried out quite a bit - that zest was much more dry and deep yellow while this one was moist and more of a light greenish-yellow. I realize now that I forgot to wash the fruit before I zested it, and wondered if there might be something in the citrus coating that could have led to this? It\u2019s almost a numbing and cooling sensation and primarily seems to be coming from the glaze/icing, which was just powdered sugar, pomelo juice, pomelo zest, salt, and heavy cream. I checked the formaldehyde content of pomelos, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be significantly high which is why I suspect it could be something on the outside of the fruit, or even possibly a strong concentration within the zest. I\u2019ve eaten pomelos fine in the past, but it\u2019s always just been the flesh, never the zest obviously.\n\nAnyone with a deeper knowledge of citrus and citrus processing have any ideas as to what might be the culprit?

{"title": "On a Mission to Recreate the Best Chai Ever\u2014But Something\u2019s Missing. Help needed", "selftext": "\nA few years ago, I was in Berlin during Christmas time, and at one of the Christmas markets, I had the most incredible hot chai of my life. It was rich, sweet, perfectly spiced, and just\u2026 magical. I tried to remember the brand, but as the years passed, I lost track of it. Now, as I\u2019ve gotten deep into making my own chai, I discovered that this brand no longer exists.\n\nFor the past month, I\u2019ve been obsessively experimenting, trying to create the perfect chai concentrate or powder. And I mean obsessively. I\u2019ve tried everything\u2014roasting the spices, not roasting the spices, steeping for different amounts of time, boiling, using different types of pots, experimenting with a pressure cooker, a regular pot, sweetened, unsweetened, different sugar concentrations, absurd amounts of spices\u2026 seriously, I\u2019ve thrown everything at this.\n\nBut no matter what I do, I keep ending up with something that tastes kind of weak, kind of flat. It\u2019s frustrating. I know there\u2019s a way to get that deep, rich chai flavor, but I just can\u2019t seem to crack the code.\n\nOne theory I have (and this is where I need your help) is that the key issue might be solubility. Maybe the essential flavors of chai spices dissolve much better in fat than in water. When making chai the usual way\u2014brewing spices in water and then adding milk\u2014the milk seems to help bring everything together, probably because of its fat content. But if I\u2019m making a concentrate, it might not be enough.\n\nSo here\u2019s my wild idea: What if the chai extract needs to be fat-based rather than water-based? Maybe something like cocoa butter, ghee, or another fat could act as a better carrier for the spice flavors.\n\nHas anyone ever tried something like this? Or does anyone have a foolproof method for making a chai concentrate or powder that actually captures the full depth of flavor? Would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nTL;DR:\nTrying to recreate the best chai I ever had but keep getting weak flavors. Thinking fat might extract the spices better than water.

I am working a part-time job that has food safety records that I need to fill in every day that I could put in my resume but I know this is not enough.\n\n  \nJust recently, a guy told me to contact people from Linkedin to look for \"intern\" or to volunteer to work at their company for free for the sake of experience. He said to do 2 weeks to 1 month of work, and he told me you could do this internship/volunteer as much as possible. \n\nMy question to you guys is, would anyone these companies be open to accept me as an \"intern\" even after I have graduated and is this a viable option for me to do in order to find a job in my field? I hope you could give me insight and opinion towards this.

{"title": "Viscometer Troubleshooting", "selftext": "I have a Bonvoisin rotary viscometer that is newly purchased. As far as I know it hasn't been used before. Currently I am attempting to test samples of a thick sugar syrup. \n\nI am attempting to measure the syrup with the aim of matching our development of the syrup to be within range of another syrup which was made and measured in another facility by a brookfield instrument. The brookfield measurement was around 160k cP at 45C with a brookfield spindle (26 i think?). I have our syrup in a water bath and syrup is registering 45C. I am using the manual's stated minimum volume (400mL) in a 500mL beaker which matches the units specifications for dimensions. The rotors and spindle minimum depth are being met and the depth demarcation on the spindle is covered by the sample.\n\nThe Bonvoisin came with 4 rotors/spindles. According to the user manual's reference chart, the last two (two smallest) are likely most ideal for the expected viscosity. I have run both spindles at nearly every RPM (0.1 increments) and I only receive a reading at RPM 3 when the timer is set to two minutes. Every other RPM or timing setting produces a result of 0 cP and 0 FS% or it fails to complete its cycle and shuts off with a beep. The manual and general internet sleuthing hasn't provided an understanding of what is happening when it does that, but I suspect it is a protection for when the settings are not compatible with the inherent viscosity of the sample to protect the unit. When I do get a reading it is between 250K-450K (depends on settings) and the FS% is 120% to 320%. Nudging the RPM down by a 0.1 or up by 0.1 when I do get a reading results in a reading of 0 again or a failed run.\n\nI did not see anything in the manual regarding calibration but I suspect that is my next move.\n\nViscometers are not an area of great expertise for me so its very possible I am missing something simple.

Or brix and temperature is more important?? That's where my dilemma is at.\n\nCuz I have several choices of syrup raw material that have lower DE. So that would help to attain the thick consistency without heating it up to 240F (kinda risky for the production people as well cuz it's too hot).\n\nBUT if it's more about the brix and temperature, then I can use a higher DE level which means higher total sugar but lower viscosity (cuz it might trigger a crystalization in the pipping so I would need to worry if it's not about consistency, then I can use a low viscosity syrup but with high total sugar.

I'm hoping someone here can give me some feedback before I start the recipe testing, since vegan milk chocolate is absurdly expensive, I'd like to minize as much waste as possible while testing. \n\nMilk Chocolate Ganache \n\nOat milk 22.55g.\n\nCocoa butter 2g.\n\nRefined coconut oil 13.39g.\n\nGlucose 4.835g.\n\nDextrose 3.835g.\n\nInvert sugar 3.835g.\n\nSorbitol 2.835g.\n\n52% Milk chocolate 46.05g.\n\nSoy protein powder 0.69g.\n\nCitric acid 0.5g.\n\nLoranns preseve it 0.8g. \n\nPinch salt. \n\nI'm hoping to extend the shelf life with things like sorbitol & glucose, which binds to available water thus reducing the AW content, and prevents recrystallization of sugar. \nThe citric acid lowers the PH of the ganache, making it so the Loranns preserve it (potassium sorbate based) will actually work, as potassium sorbate requires a slightly acidic environment to work as a preservative. \nMilk proteins typically stabilizes the emulsion of a ganache, but since this recipe contains no cream I am adding soy protein powder. This should improve the quality of the emulsion. \nInstead of butter, the fats of this recipe will be coconut oil & cocoa butter. The butter I typically use in ganache is 82% fat, coconut oil and cocoa butter are over 90% fat but I dont think this will pose any issues. \nAs my liquid I will be using oat milk. It was the creamiest out of all the plant milks I tested. I don't think this will negativity effect the AW score any more than dairy milk would. \nAll of these ingredients will be processed with an immersion blender using the hot method of ganache making. This would mean heating the liquid parts of the recipe and pouring it on top of the fats, then emulsifying. Heating up the ingredients will also help reduce microorganisms. \n\nIs there anything I'm not considering? Anything here that is just dead wrong? How do you rekon the shelf life of this would be?

I've been using the often-touted super salt mixture of 9 parts salt/0.9 parts MSG/0.1 part Disodium ribonucleotides as I know that MSG and nucleotides enhance saltiness and boost umami, but after reading this study, I've kind of had an epiphany that saltiness isn't all we seek in food, and my efforts to enhance saltiness isn't really something to aim for. \n\nReally, what I'm after is fullness of flavour and intensity of flavour.

I am wondering whether or not resting cookie dough in ball form is as effective at hydrating cookie dough and adding flavor complexity to cookie dough as resting the dough as one single whole log?\n\nFor example: Traditionally, when resting chocolate chip cookie dough standard practice is to scoop all of it out of the bowl and roll it into one large log, wrap it in Saran Wrap and put it in the fridge to rest for 3 days. The benefits of this are flour hydration and an increase in flavor complexity. \n\nSo, let\u2019s say that instead of leaving it in a single large log, you portioned the cookie dough into balls, ready for baking, and left those in the fridge for 3 days to rest. \n\nWould the rate of dough hydration be the same as if you were to leave it as a log? Also, would you get the same increase in flavor complexity in the dough? Or would this not matter at all, assuming all of the ingredients are properly/evenly incorporated, and dough hydration would still occur to the same degree as if the dough were in a single log, but just on a smaller scale?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1hbcsqm/resting_cookie_doughflour_hydration_differences/", "created_utc": 1733866036.0, "score": 3, "author": "hlj9", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/1hbcsqm/resting_cookie_doughflour_hydration_differences/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Proofreading my improvised (Nitro) Cold Brew extraction method", "selftext": "Hello, I've lately been interested in making nitro cold brew at home, but curiosity got the best of me and I've wanted to tinker with the method since I've started reading [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Coffee-brewing-control-chart-for-water-hardness-70-ppm-109-ppm-and-290-ppm_fig1_360413314). Unbeknownst to me, I wasn't aware of how time efficient vacuum extractions were (compared to traditional methods), so after reading this I've tried to follow along the article and understand it as precisely as I can (I'm not used to food science or scientific jargon). From what I've understood, this method (technically) would be able to extract the coffee to a satisfactory range in around 2-3 300s 200mbar vacuum cycles. To this I've tried putting together a method, along with some possibilities and questions for variants.\n\n# Ingredients and tools\n\n\\- 1:14 500g weight ratio of coffee grounds/water, kept separate (cold temperature preferably)  \n\\- Course ground medium roast high quality coffee  \n\\- Moderate hardness water  \n\\-(Optional) undefined amount of ethanol or vodka (for ethanol soluble phenol extraction)  \n\\- Mason jar (kept cold) with vacuum pump (minimum -80kpa)  \n\\-(Optional) Food safe magnetic stirrer to keep extraction even  \n\\- 2 NO2 (foodsafe) cartridges  \n\\- Whipped cream charger (preferably cold)\n\n# Method\n\n1. Mix coffee grounds (with vodka) and hard water in jar (add stirring magnet if necessary).  \n  \n2. Begin 2-3 extraction cycles:  \n\\- Pump out air until 200mbar  \n\\- Let extract for 300 seconds (stirring if possible)  \n\\- Stop extraction by shocking back to room pressure (1013mbar or 1 atm)  \n\\- Repeat.  \n  \n3. Extract solution from jar without coffee grounds (nor stirring magnet) into whipped cream charger.\n\n4. Pump it with first NO2 charge, let charger rest refrigerated for (undefined, 1-3) hours.\n\n5. Pump second NO2 charge, serve.\n\n# Concerns and doubts\n\nRelated to this extraction, I have food safety concerns for the modified atmosphere inside the charger during the pressurization because of botulism, and also greater concerns about the structural stress for the mason jar during extraction. If vodka or ethanol is used to extract, it would be helpful to keep the contents inside the jar while inside the vacuum cold so the ethanol doesn't boil off and create pressure inside the vacuum, worsening the extraction cycle, on top of that I'm unsure of possible chemical reactions of the ethanol with NO2 inside the charger which may deteriorate the pressurization or just make the extraction unsafe.  \n  \nOther than that, I'm here to be corrected if at any point of this process something wrong may happen before I try it out.

I worked at one company for two years, and I reached a point where I hated every single day of work. Sundays nights were awful because I knew Monday was coming, and I\u2019d have to start all over again. I switched to another company, and at first, it wasn't so bad\u2014probably because everything was new, and I had a lot to learn. But now, once again, I hate my job.\n\nIn my free time, I love cooking. I\u2019m always watching new recipes or looking up anything related to cooking. When I was little, I wanted to be a chef, but I know it's a very demanding career. Cooking as a hobby is one thing, but cooking professionally as a career is a whole other story.\n\nRecently, I discovered the field of Food Science (yes, I had never heard of it before...), and I found it really interesting. I know it doesn't necessarily involve cooking, but understanding the science behind it seems fascinating to me. I\u2019m also *almost*\u00a0vegan (?) (about 90% of the time), and the idea of working at a company that makes plant based food, like for example mock meats, is something that really appeals to me.\n\nHere\u2019s my main question: do you think I should start over and just got for it and study Food Science?

Is it too late? I think I\u2019d be starting to work again around 30\u2026 (I know people change careers at any age, but I need someone else to reassure me to feel more confident about it).\n* Is it very difficult? I have a university degree in Computer Engineering. I really liked math, but I only had one chemistry course, so I don\u2019t have much of an opinion about it. I didn\u2019t enjoy physics, especially anything related to magnetism.\n* Would I have difficulties studying this career and being plant-based?\n\nThanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1had619/career_in_food_science_i_need_opinions/", "created_utc": 1733760528.0, "score": 5, "author": "FawzIae", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/1had619/career_in_food_science_i_need_opinions/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Grocery store apples: unperturbed wax or refrigerate?", "selftext": "Hello!\n\nMy question is which scenario in your opinion is more likely to make grocery store apples last longer:\n\n1. Left out at room temp and washed right before eating (so wax coating is largely intact while aging)\n\nOr\n\n2. Washed at time of purchase and then refrigerated until eating\n\nI\u2019m sure it depends on a lot of things like how well they\u2019re washed, what kind of wax, how they\u2019re stored, crisper drawer or not, etc. so that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for opinions. But facts and studies are obviously welcome!\n\nI\u2019m leaning in one direction but want to hear answers from people who are more knowledgeable about the aging processes of fruit\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses! Yeah I understand unwashed and refrigerated would keep them the longest. I\u2019m basically trying to convince myself it\u2019s ok for me to wash them all immediately and then put them in the fridge. I\u2019m disabled and for reasons that are annoying to explain, these two scenarios are the most likely to happen for me. Scenario 2, if I can manage it on shopping day (or any time before I want an apple) is easiest for me. Often I can easily access a refrigerated apple but can less easily wash it. So if I can get all the washing done at once that helps sometimes. But I also have adhd and if it\u2019s unseen it\u2019s often unremembered so my anxiety is worried about messing up the wax by washing them and then refrigerating them and forgetting about them. What I will end up doing with the apples will probably vary depending on my ability at the time. But for peace of mind, I think I was hoping someone would tell me refrigerating keeps them longer. Or if someone told me, even refrigerated they go bad super fast once you wash them, then I\u2019d know. Trial and error is fine for me but I was wondering if there was any scientific knowledge to answer my question. The literal question of which condition keeps apples longer, not the question of what should I do with my apples. Maybe next time I\u2019ll do half and half and see what happens \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know about the stem thing, that\u2019s interesting!

In my field we have 0 data collection, almost no standardization of procedures, and little to no ability to check the results.\n\nMaybe that answers your\u00a0 question of why the food in your school cafeteria, hospital, or canteen stinks.\n\nThis situation its been normalized by two main factors: we compete at cost, not at quality (we have no idea how to standardize quality). And that it's a low-specificity field; if you take ingredients with some criteria and warm them up until they smell good, you can be pretty sure that's good enough. This pincer has left the industry in a halt.\u00a0\n\nFor some reason I'm really passionate about this, and I think having good food would improve greatly the quality of life in those already struggling in hospitals, residences, schools or even in the military .\n\nFurthermore, seeing how our culinary abilities are declining as a society\u00a0 in some years it will appear a huge market. For already cooked every day meals, and I don't think the exploitative model of doordash, uber etc..\u00a0 can withstand the size of this market.\n\nAnd I hope we already understood we can't live with the frozen premade foods the Alimentary industry offered us.

Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL particles, which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD.

{"title": "How to make stretchy teriyaki sauce", "selftext": "There used to be a japanese place around the corner from us when I first started dating my girlfriend a couple of years ago. They made this teriyaki tofu with this thick, gelatinous sauce that wasn\u2019t clumpy, but also wasn\u2019t runny. When you bit into one of the pieces of tofu, the coating of sauce stretched apart where you bit into the tofu while retaining its shape at the other end of the piece.\n\nI\u2019ve tried a handful of small variations to traditional teriyaki sauce recipes. My current thought process is that a recipe that uses approx 160ml of liquid, including somewhere between 2-7g of gelatin and between 15-30ml of cornstarch slurry, would probably approach the kind of texture I\u2019m aiming for.\n\nSo far though, I haven\u2019t been able to make anything stick (pun not intended) and my limited knowledge of the science of how gelatin and cornstarch impacts sauces is extremely limited. I was also thinking that maybe including 1 gram of xanthan gum and 1 gram of pectin could help with the stretchiness I\u2019m aiming for.\n\nIf anyone who understands this sort of thing better than I do could work through the possible reactions and impacts different mixtures might have, and what I could do to make something a little closer to what I\u2019ve made already, I\u2019d be really grateful.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodscience/comments/1h4tpm4/how_to_make_stretchy_teriyaki_sauce/", "created_utc": 1733142052.0, "score": 3, "author": "unkemptbg", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/foodscience/comments/1h4tpm4/how_to_make_stretchy_teriyaki_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The health department has known about our machine from day one but due to their lack of knowledge in the area has decided to move us to the Department of Agriculture. With this they want a HACCP plan created but upon talking to their SME, it appears the wants for what we are doing is unrelated. What I mean is they will all a lidded meal(no vacuum or gas) to last 7 days per the label but in HACCP it talks about 30 days without spoilage. I have zero want to make a fresh meal last this long. \n\nThe work arounds presented are to have all meat cured, raw products or have clients open meals upon leaving the facility. The last option is testing ph and water activity which thus far has appeared very costly.

I've directed them to make a competitor clone to limit R&D risk, but they have never made this snack before.\n\nThe contract is vague on qualitative deliverables, they \\*could\\* deliver just about anything and call it done. I'm completely reliant on their good faith judgement, which is... *uncomfortable*.\n\n**Is 2 days a reasonable time/cost for a specialist to develop an extruded product?**\n\n**Any other risks I should consider or push to cover?**\n\nI am worried about them delivering crap... and I also worry about being bled out with a \"nearly there, just another couple of days\" style of project creep. First time in food, but not first time with problem projects :P\n\nI'd appreciate your any advice!\n\n**UPDATE: providing this here case it's helpful to others.**  \n  \nTalked to the provider based on feedback here. To their credit they were pretty open when pressed specifically about deliverables / risks and their assumptions. Seems that extrusion folks considered stability / shelf life quality to be \"the labs\" problem and were taking the approach of *\"We can extrude it and get the immediate physical characteristics you want with high confidence in that time\" ....* \n\n  \nUnspoken however was *\".... but if it's not stable/degrades quickly/molds then that's a separate issue and you'll need to reformulate and try again (another R&D loop). Unknown how many loops would be required to get shelf stable.\"*   \n  \nSo their definition of success and mine are different. They were considering successful delivery as functional units within their org chart, not total product performance... which is frustrating but at least I'm aware now.   \n  \nWhen I pressed them on reducing the cost/risk of this process, hardening deliverables, they advised me to develop the formulation with a specialist elsewhere before engaging with them.
