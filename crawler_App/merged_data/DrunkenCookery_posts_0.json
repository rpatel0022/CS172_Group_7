Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of \"melts\". Almost every \"grilled cheese\" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called \"grilledcheese\" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples \"grilled cheeses\" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.\nYou god damn heretics.

The fact that this subreddit is called \"grilledcheese\" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. \nLet me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses  or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples \"grilled cheeses\" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.\n\nYou god damn heretics.

Here\u2019s the steps I use:\n\nCut up some garlic and onions and get those cooking at a low heat with half a stick of butter, while prepping the rest of the meal. I also cut up a whole green pepper but don\u2019t saut\u00e9 those until much later.\n \nCube up the eggplant. Goal is to get them into nice bite size pieces. \n\nTo bread the eggplant dip each piece into eggs that are whisked and then coat them with Italian bread crumbs. \n\nAfter the eggplant has been cut up and then breaded. Time for frying them! I use a small pan with cooking oil and usually fry a few pieces at a time. Goal is to get a nice crust and that\u2019s all. No need to cook them for too long as they will also be baking in the oven for 15 min or so. I set the fried pieces into my cast iron skillet and when done throw on the Parmesan. \n\nTime to add the sauce! Grab your favorite spaghetti sauce. I use my favorite local sauce which is just tomato and basil, but really anything works. \n\nTime for more cheese. I\u2019ll throw a cup of shredded mozzarella. Then mix all the sauce so that the cheese is evenly distributed. Then I\u2019ll use provolone slices to cover the entire top of the pan.  \nI usually use the whole package of provolone because it gives it a nice cheese crust! \n\nBake at 400 degrees for 15 min, let it cool for another 10-15. I am at a higher elevation (5000 feet) so there might be some adjustments on your part.\n\nI think that\u2019s it.

But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. \n\nI'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. \n\nShit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples \"grilled cheeses\" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment I saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.\n\nYou god damn heretics.
