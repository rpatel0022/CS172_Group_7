{"title": "Gaufres de Bruxelles (Belgian Waffles)", "selftext": "I've been tweaking various waffle recipes for about a year now. I wanted a waffle that used beer as the primary liquid, not just waffles with a couple tablespoons of beer in them. After settling on a decent recipe, I fine tuned flavors and then adjusted proportions so that a standard 330ml bottle of Belgian beer would satisfy an entire recipe and there wouldn't be leftover beer. I'm finally satisfied with the results and wanted to share.\n\nI have tried this with many Belgian beers. It's fun to find a flavor profile you like and then incorporate it into the recipe. There are no right or wrong beers to use, I've tried everything from Jupiler to Abt 12 and everything in between. My preference leans towards darker beers like a dubbel or a quad, as lighter beers or even tripels don't really bring a lot to the party in terms of flavor. But like I said, it's fun to experiment and find something that works best for you.\n\nA good deep pocket waffle iron is important for authentic Belgian waffles. I suppose this recipe would work in a thin iron, although I've never tried it. But the quality of these waffles is so dependent on them being yeasted, thick, and puffy.\n\nSo here's the recipe:\n\n* 3c all-purpose flour\n* 3/4c whole wheat flour\n* 2-1/4t dry yeast\n* 3T brown sugar\n* 1/4t salt\n* 3 eggs\n* 6oz butter, melted and cooled to room temperature \n* 1T milk\n* 1-1/2t vanilla \n* 1 bottle (11.2oz) Belgian beer\n\nStir together flour, yeast, brown sugar and salt in a large bowl.\nIn a smaller bowl, beat the eggs until frothy. Gradually drizzle in butter while whisking. Add milk and vanilla and whisk. Pour in beer while whisking. Switch to a spatula and stir wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Cover bowl and let proof for 45-90 minutes.\n\nHeat a deep waffle iron to high heat and cook waffles according to the waffle maker's instructions. [I prefer to make the waffles eccentric shapes using an ice cream scoop rather than trying to fill the entire surface of the waffle iron.](http://imgur.com/QzJY3xo) This recipe will make about 12 waffles if you're using a #16 scoop to portion the batter.\n\nWaffles can be made all at once and then cooled on a wire rack. Leftovers should be wrapped tightly and can be dropped in the toaster (or returned to the waffle iron) to heat and crisp them before eating. Otherwise the batter can retard in the refrigerator and you can make fresh waffles over the next 3 days if you want to go through the trouble of heating the iron every time you want waffles.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookwithbeer/comments/4f8f1n/gaufres_de_bruxelles_belgian_waffles/", "created_utc": 1460926408.0, "score": 16, "author": "None", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/cookwithbeer/comments/4f8f1n/gaufres_de_bruxelles_belgian_waffles/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Drunken Chicken", "selftext": "I just noticed this sub and thought I'd share a recipe I just posted on AskReddit a few minutes ago. It's super easy.\n\nI use [Organic Ruby Ale](http://www.bcliquorstores.com/product/689497) and it tastes fantastic on its own.\n\nHere's a recipe that I have had much success with:\n\n**Drunken Chicken**\n\n1 chicken (preferably organic, nice and plump)\n\nseveral sticks of unsalted butter\n\n2 - 3 level tablespoons of granulated garlic (I like garlic so I use more)\n\n2 level tablespoons of lemon pepper\n\n2 level tablespoons of paprika\n\n1 level tablespoon of salt\n\ncouple sprigs of rosemary/oregano (fresh if at all possible), optional\n\n1 bottle of Organic Ruby Ale\n\nPreheat oven to 475 F. \n\nWash and dry your chicken. Gently separate the skin from the flesh of the breast and of the legs using your fingers.\n\nIn a small bowl, combine your salt and spices thoroughly. \n\nNext you will put some of the spice and butter underneath the skin of the chicken. You can either soften a few sticks of butter and mix this into your spices until it's well mixed and consistent, or you can take a little spice mix and rub a little under the skin of your chicken and then insert some butter under the skin afterward. Both works equally well. \n\nRub remaining spice mix (there should be quite a bit left over) all and inside the chicken. If you're using the fresh rosemary/oregano, put that inside the chicken at this point.\n\nPut chicken into roasting dish. Gently pour beer into the cavity of the chicken until it is full. If it pours out immediately try pinning the cavity shut with toothpicks so that at least some liquid is retained. Pour the rest of the bottle of beer around the chicken. \n\nPut roasting dish with your chicken into the oven. Lower temperature to 385 F. Roast for 1.5 hours, basting as necessary. \n\nWhen you remove the chicken from the oven, let it set for at least 10 - 15 minutes before carving, this will help keep it juicy. Cover it with tinfoil. \n\nTo make gravy, take the juices from the roasting dish, put them in a pan, and mix in two tablespoons of flour. Over medium heat, stir until the gravy is thick and even. \n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1blpsr/drunken_chicken/", "created_utc": 1365013393.0, "score": 18, "author": "None", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1blpsr/drunken_chicken/", "html_title": ""}

I'm sure most of the folks on /r/Homebrewing like good eats as much as great beer and this recipe is made with and pairs well with a nice stout.  This is my take on Guinness Stew, tweaked from a few recipes I found.  Made with a bottle of my homebrewed oatmeal stout!  Served it with some fresh baked crusty French bread and it was awesome.\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 2 Lbs lean stew beef\n* 2 Tbsp olive oil\n* 2 Tbsp flour\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Dash of cayenne\n* 2 large onions, diced\n* 2 large cloves of garlic, minced\n* 2 Tbsp tomato paste dissolved in 1/4 cup beef broth (If you don\u2019t have beef broth you can use 1 tsp powdered beef bouillon in the flour mixture and dilute the tomato paste with water)\n* 10 oz of your favorite stout\n* 2 cups baby carrots or large diced carrots\n* 1 lb diced potatoes\n* 8 oz sliced mushrooms\n* 1 tsp dried thyme\n\n**DIRECTIONS**\n\n1. Toss stew beef with 1 Tbsp of the oil.\n1. In a bowl, combine the flour and all dry seasonings.\n1. Toss the meat with the seasoned flour.\n1. Heat remaining Tbsp oil (use a bit more if needed) in a large skillet over high heat.\n1. Brown the meat on all sides.\n1. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, garlic and tomato paste diluted in broth or water.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes.\n1. Transfer the beef and onions to a crock pot and pour 1/2 the stout into the skillet.\n1. Heat to boiling and hold for 5 minutes, stirring well to deglaze the pan.\n1. Pour the sauce over the meat and add the carrots, potatoes and mushrooms.\n1. Cook on high for 3-4 hours, stirring occasionally.\n1. Approximately 30 minutes before serving add the rest of the stout to the pot and stir well.\n1. When done the stew should have a nice, heavy sauce on it without being too thick.  If sauce is too thick you can thin it with a bit of water.  If sauce is too thin dissolve 1 tsp of corn starch in 1 cup of cold water and add in small increments to the stew, stirring and allowing the sauce a couple of minutes to thicken.  Serve with fresh-baked crusty French bread and more STOUT!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1u3d4s/beef_and_stout_stew_made_with_my_homebrew_xpost/", "created_utc": 1388501454.0, "score": 15, "author": "itsme_timd", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1u3d4s/beef_and_stout_stew_made_with_my_homebrew_xpost/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Looking for a beer to use with Italian beef", "selftext": "Hey all. I'm looking to try something new and I see a lot of crockpot recipes for Italian beef in the crockpot which are calling my name. A lot of them say you can use beer instead of stock. These recipes usually involve banana peppers/brine and dry Italian dressing mix. Looking for a beer that will stand up to the flavors but won't clash with the peppers/brine and dressing mix. \n\nMy first thought is a dark beer, possibly a stout like Guinness but I'm not sure. The lady thinks a lighter beer like a Blue Moon would work better...but I'm more of a dark beer guy myself and I'd hate to buy a 6 pack something I wouldn't drink.\n\nThoughts?\n\nUPDATE 1 (3/7/2015): Went with a Dogfish Head Saison Du Buff as suggested by one of the commenters.

{"title": "Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes", "selftext": "Back at Thanksgiving I decided to give [Sean Paxton's Garlic IPA Mashed Potatoes](http://www.homebrewchef.com/RoastedGarlicIPAMashPotatoes.html) a whirl, but with a slight twist.\n\nI am re-printing his recipe as I used it here, but I encourage you to immediately visit his site for some amazing recipes and inspiration for cooking with beer. His [Home Brewed Chef podcast](http://thebrewingnetwork.com/shows/The-Home-Brewed-Chef) is worth checking out, too.\n\nI tried the cream/butter sauce on its own before adding the beer, and it was mild and a little bland. Once the Saison du BUFF was dropped in there, it was a difference of night and day. The spices from the beer stood out as if the sauce was well-seasoned on its own. These flavors were easily distinguished in the final product, too. The potatoes were an absolute hit.\n\n---\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled & cut into large chunks\n* 2 heads garlic\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 4 sprigs thyme\n* 1 cup unsalted butter\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 4 tbsp Dogfish Head Saison du BUFF\n* Sea salt\n* Black pepper\n\n---\n\n**Directions**\n\nSet your oven to 300\u00b0 F.\n\nPotatoes: \n\n1. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan or dutch oven with enough cold water to cover.\n2. Add enough salt to taste like ocean water and bring to a boil over high heat.\n3. Cook until tender, about 15 \u2013 20 minutes.\n4. Drain well.\n5. Press the potatoes through a ricer or mash them with a potato masher until smooth back into the same pot.\n\nGarlic paste:\n\n1. Take each head of garlic and remove as much of the papery outside skin as you can.\n2. With a sharp knife, cut the top 1/5 of the head off, exposing the tops of the garlic cloves.\n3. Take a small square piece of foil and place the cut head in the center.\n4. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil on top of each head then a sprig of thyme.\n5. Season with a touch of salt and pepper.\n6. Wrap each up and place in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the smell of garlic fills your kitchen.\n7. Remove from the oven, open each pouch and let cool for 5 minutes.\n8. Use a paper towel folded over a few times to act like a small potholder and squeeze the cloves out into a bowl\n9. Mash with a fork until smooth.\n\nSauce: \n\n1. In a medium pan, add butter, cream and 2 sprigs of thyme and turn heat to medium.\n2. Bring the mixture to a boil, turning down to low and simmer for 10 minutes.\n3. Remove the sprigs and add garlic paste and simmer another 3 minutes, using a whisk to stir and breakup the garlic.\n4.

{"title": "Gaufres de Bruxelles (Belgian Waffles)", "selftext": "I've been tweaking various waffle recipes for about a year now. I wanted a waffle that used beer as the primary liquid, not just waffles with a couple tablespoons of beer in them. After settling on a decent recipe, I fine tuned flavors and then adjusted proportions so that a standard 330ml bottle of Belgian beer would satisfy an entire recipe and there wouldn't be leftover beer. I'm finally satisfied with the results and wanted to share.\n\nI have tried this with many Belgian beers. It's fun to find a flavor profile you like and then incorporate it into the recipe. There are no right or wrong beers to use, I've tried everything from Jupiler to Abt 12 and everything in between. My preference leans towards darker beers like a dubbel or a quad, as lighter beers or even tripels don't really bring a lot to the party in terms of flavor. But like I said, it's fun to experiment and find something that works best for you.\n\nA good deep pocket waffle iron is important for authentic Belgian waffles. I suppose this recipe would work in a thin iron, although I've never tried it. But the quality of these waffles is so dependent on them being yeasted, thick, and puffy.\n\nSo here's the recipe:\n\n* 3c all-purpose flour\n* 3/4c whole wheat flour\n* 2-1/4t dry yeast\n* 3T brown sugar\n* 1/4t salt\n* 3 eggs\n* 6oz butter, melted and cooled to room temperature \n* 1T milk\n* 1-1/2t vanilla \n* 1 bottle (11.2oz) Belgian beer\n\nStir together flour, yeast, brown sugar and salt in a large bowl.\nIn a smaller bowl, beat the eggs until frothy. Gradually drizzle in butter while whisking. Add milk and vanilla and whisk. Pour in beer while whisking. Switch to a spatula and stir wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Cover bowl and let proof for 45-90 minutes.\n\nHeat a deep waffle iron to high heat and cook waffles according to the waffle maker's instructions. [I prefer to make the waffles eccentric shapes using an ice cream scoop rather than trying to fill the entire surface of the waffle iron.](http://imgur.com/QzJY3xo) This recipe will make about 12 waffles if you're using a #16 scoop to portion the batter.\n\nWaffles can be made all at once and then cooled on a wire rack. Leftovers should be wrapped tightly and can be dropped in the toaster (or returned to the waffle iron) to heat and crisp them before eating. Otherwise the batter can retard in the refrigerator and you can make fresh waffles over the next 3 days if you want to go through the trouble of heating the iron every time you want waffles.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookwithbeer/comments/4f8f1n/gaufres_de_bruxelles_belgian_waffles/", "created_utc": 1460926408.0, "score": 16, "author": "None", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/cookwithbeer/comments/4f8f1n/gaufres_de_bruxelles_belgian_waffles/", "html_title": ""}

I'm looking to try something new and I see a lot of crockpot recipes for Italian beef in the crockpot which are calling my name. A lot of them say you can use beer instead of stock.

Looking for a beer that will stand up to the flavors but won't clash with the peppers/brine and dressing mix. \n\nMy first thought is a dark beer, possibly a stout like Guinness but I'm not sure. The lady thinks a lighter beer like a Blue Moon would work better...but I'm more of a dark beer guy myself and I'd hate to buy a 6 pack something I wouldn't drink.\n\nThoughts?\n\nUPDATE 1 (3/7/2015): Went with a Dogfish Head Saison Du Buff as suggested by one of the commenters.

I'm sure most of the folks on /r/Homebrewing like good eats as much as great beer and this recipe is made with and pairs well with a nice stout.  This is my take on Guinness Stew, tweaked from a few recipes I found.  Made with a bottle of my homebrewed oatmeal stout!  Served it with some fresh baked crusty French bread and it was awesome.\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 2 Lbs lean stew beef\n* 2 Tbsp olive oil\n* 2 Tbsp flour\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Dash of cayenne\n* 2 large onions, diced\n* 2 large cloves of garlic, minced\n* 2 Tbsp tomato paste dissolved in 1/4 cup beef broth (If you don\u2019t have beef broth you can use 1 tsp powdered beef bouillon in the flour mixture and dilute the tomato paste with water)\n* 10 oz of your favorite stout\n* 2 cups baby carrots or large diced carrots\n* 1 lb diced potatoes\n* 8 oz sliced mushrooms\n* 1 tsp dried thyme\n\n**DIRECTIONS**\n\n1. Toss stew beef with 1 Tbsp of the oil.\n1. In a bowl, combine the flour and all dry seasonings.\n1. Toss the meat with the seasoned flour.\n1. Heat remaining Tbsp oil (use a bit more if needed) in a large skillet over high heat.\n1. Brown the meat on all sides.\n1. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, garlic and tomato paste diluted in broth or water.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes.\n1. Transfer the beef and onions to a crock pot and pour 1/2 the stout into the skillet.\n1. Heat to boiling and hold for 5 minutes, stirring well to deglaze the pan.\n1. Pour the sauce over the meat and add the carrots, potatoes and mushrooms.\n1. Cook on high for 3-4 hours, stirring occasionally.\n1. Approximately 30 minutes before serving add the rest of the stout to the pot and stir well.\n1. When done the stew should have a nice, heavy sauce on it without being too thick.  If sauce is too thick you can thin it with a bit of water.  If sauce is too thin dissolve 1 tsp of corn starch in 1 cup of cold water and add in small increments to the stew, stirring and allowing the sauce a couple of minutes to thicken.

{"title": "Drunken Chicken", "selftext": "I just noticed this sub and thought I'd share a recipe I just posted on AskReddit a few minutes ago. It's super easy.\n\nI use [Organic Ruby Ale](http://www.bcliquorstores.com/product/689497) and it tastes fantastic on its own.\n\nHere's a recipe that I have had much success with:\n\n**Drunken Chicken**\n\n1 chicken (preferably organic, nice and plump)\n\nseveral sticks of unsalted butter\n\n2 - 3 level tablespoons of granulated garlic (I like garlic so I use more)\n\n2 level tablespoons of lemon pepper\n\n2 level tablespoons of paprika\n\n1 level tablespoon of salt\n\ncouple sprigs of rosemary/oregano (fresh if at all possible), optional\n\n1 bottle of Organic Ruby Ale\n\nPreheat oven to 475 F. \n\nWash and dry your chicken. Gently separate the skin from the flesh of the breast and of the legs using your fingers.\n\nIn a small bowl, combine your salt and spices thoroughly. \n\nNext you will put some of the spice and butter underneath the skin of the chicken. You can either soften a few sticks of butter and mix this into your spices until it's well mixed and consistent, or you can take a little spice mix and rub a little under the skin of your chicken and then insert some butter under the skin afterward. Both works equally well. \n\nRub remaining spice mix (there should be quite a bit left over) all and inside the chicken. If you're using the fresh rosemary/oregano, put that inside the chicken at this point.\n\nPut chicken into roasting dish. Gently pour beer into the cavity of the chicken until it is full. If it pours out immediately try pinning the cavity shut with toothpicks so that at least some liquid is retained. Pour the rest of the bottle of beer around the chicken. \n\nPut roasting dish with your chicken into the oven. Lower temperature to 385 F. Roast for 1.5 hours, basting as necessary. \n\nWhen you remove the chicken from the oven, let it set for at least 10 - 15 minutes before carving, this will help keep it juicy. Cover it with tinfoil. \n\nTo make gravy, take the juices from the roasting dish, put them in a pan, and mix in two tablespoons of flour. Over medium heat, stir until the gravy is thick and even. \n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1blpsr/drunken_chicken/", "created_utc": 1365013393.0, "score": 17, "author": "None", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1blpsr/drunken_chicken/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes", "selftext": "Back at Thanksgiving I decided to give [Sean Paxton's Garlic IPA Mashed Potatoes](http://www.homebrewchef.com/RoastedGarlicIPAMashPotatoes.html) a whirl, but with a slight twist.\n\nI am re-printing his recipe as I used it here, but I encourage you to immediately visit his site for some amazing recipes and inspiration for cooking with beer. His [Home Brewed Chef podcast](http://thebrewingnetwork.com/shows/The-Home-Brewed-Chef) is worth checking out, too.\n\nI tried the cream/butter sauce on its own before adding the beer, and it was mild and a little bland. Once the Saison du BUFF was dropped in there, it was a difference of night and day. The spices from the beer stood out as if the sauce was well-seasoned on its own. These flavors were easily distinguished in the final product, too. The potatoes were an absolute hit.\n\n---\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled & cut into large chunks\n* 2 heads garlic\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 4 sprigs thyme\n* 1 cup unsalted butter\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 4 tbsp Dogfish Head Saison du BUFF\n* Sea salt\n* Black pepper\n\n---\n\n**Directions**\n\nSet your oven to 300\u00b0 F.\n\nPotatoes: \n\n1. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan or dutch oven with enough cold water to cover.\n2. Add enough salt to taste like ocean water and bring to a boil over high heat.\n3. Cook until tender, about 15 \u2013 20 minutes.\n4. Drain well.\n5. Press the potatoes through a ricer or mash them with a potato masher until smooth back into the same pot.\n\nGarlic paste:\n\n1. Take each head of garlic and remove as much of the papery outside skin as you can.\n2. With a sharp knife, cut the top 1/5 of the head off, exposing the tops of the garlic cloves.\n3. Take a small square piece of foil and place the cut head in the center.\n4. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil on top of each head then a sprig of thyme.\n5. Season with a touch of salt and pepper.\n6. Wrap each up and place in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the smell of garlic fills your kitchen.\n7. Remove from the oven, open each pouch and let cool for 5 minutes.\n8. Use a paper towel folded over a few times to act like a small potholder and squeeze the cloves out into a bowl\n9. Mash with a fork until smooth.\n\nSauce: \n\n1. In a medium pan, add butter, cream and 2 sprigs of thyme and turn heat to medium.\n2. Bring the mixture to a boil, turning down to low and simmer for 10 minutes.\n3. Remove the sprigs and add garlic paste and simmer another 3 minutes, using a whisk to stir and breakup the garlic.\n4. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper and add beer\n5.

{"title": "Gaufres de Bruxelles (Belgian Waffles)", "selftext": "I've been tweaking various waffle recipes for about a year now. I wanted a waffle that used beer as the primary liquid, not just waffles with a couple tablespoons of beer in them. After settling on a decent recipe, I fine tuned flavors and then adjusted proportions so that a standard 330ml bottle of Belgian beer would satisfy an entire recipe and there wouldn't be leftover beer. I'm finally satisfied with the results and wanted to share.\n\nI have tried this with many Belgian beers. It's fun to find a flavor profile you like and then incorporate it into the recipe. There are no right or wrong beers to use, I've tried everything from Jupiler to Abt 12 and everything in between. My preference leans towards darker beers like a dubbel or a quad, as lighter beers or even tripels don't really bring a lot to the party in terms of flavor. But like I said, it's fun to experiment and find something that works best for you.\n\nA good deep pocket waffle iron is important for authentic Belgian waffles. I suppose this recipe would work in a thin iron, although I've never tried it. But the quality of these waffles is so dependent on them being yeasted, thick, and puffy.\n\nSo here's the recipe:\n\n* 3c all-purpose flour\n* 3/4c whole wheat flour\n* 2-1/4t dry yeast\n* 3T brown sugar\n* 1/4t salt\n* 3 eggs\n* 6oz butter, melted and cooled to room temperature \n* 1T milk\n* 1-1/2t vanilla \n* 1 bottle (11.2oz) Belgian beer\n\nStir together flour, yeast, brown sugar and salt in a large bowl.\nIn a smaller bowl, beat the eggs until frothy. Gradually drizzle in butter while whisking. Add milk and vanilla and whisk. Pour in beer while whisking. Switch to a spatula and stir wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Cover bowl and let proof for 45-90 minutes.\n\nHeat a deep waffle iron to high heat and cook waffles according to the waffle maker's instructions. [I prefer to make the waffles eccentric shapes using an ice cream scoop rather than trying to fill the entire surface of the waffle iron.](http://imgur.com/QzJY3xo) This recipe will make about 12 waffles if you're using a #16 scoop to portion the batter.\n\nWaffles can be made all at once and then cooled on a wire rack. Leftovers should be wrapped tightly and can be dropped in the toaster (or returned to the waffle iron) to heat and crisp them before eating. Otherwise the batter can retard in the refrigerator and you can make fresh waffles over the next 3 days if you want to go through the trouble of heating the iron every time you want waffles.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookwithbeer/comments/4f8f1n/gaufres_de_bruxelles_belgian_waffles/", "created_utc": 1460926408.0, "score": 15, "author": "None", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/cookwithbeer/comments/4f8f1n/gaufres_de_bruxelles_belgian_waffles/", "html_title": ""}

Looking for a beer that will stand up to the flavors but won't clash with the peppers/brine and dressing mix. \n\nMy first thought is a dark beer, possibly a stout like Guinness but I'm not sure. The lady thinks a lighter beer like a Blue Moon would work better...but I'm more of a dark beer guy myself and I'd hate to buy a 6 pack something I wouldn't drink.\n\nThoughts?\n\nUPDATE 1 (3/7/2015): Went with a Dogfish Head Saison Du Buff as suggested by one of the commenters.

I'm sure most of the folks on /r/Homebrewing like good eats as much as great beer and this recipe is made with and pairs well with a nice stout.  This is my take on Guinness Stew, tweaked from a few recipes I found.  Made with a bottle of my homebrewed oatmeal stout!  Served it with some fresh baked crusty French bread and it was awesome.\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 2 Lbs lean stew beef\n* 2 Tbsp olive oil\n* 2 Tbsp flour\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Dash of cayenne\n* 2 large onions, diced\n* 2 large cloves of garlic, minced\n* 2 Tbsp tomato paste dissolved in 1/4 cup beef broth (If you don\u2019t have beef broth you can use 1 tsp powdered beef bouillon in the flour mixture and dilute the tomato paste with water)\n* 10 oz of your favorite stout\n* 2 cups baby carrots or large diced carrots\n* 1 lb diced potatoes\n* 8 oz sliced mushrooms\n* 1 tsp dried thyme\n\n**DIRECTIONS**\n\n1. Toss stew beef with 1 Tbsp of the oil.\n1. In a bowl, combine the flour and all dry seasonings.\n1. Toss the meat with the seasoned flour.\n1. Heat remaining Tbsp oil (use a bit more if needed) in a large skillet over high heat.\n1. Brown the meat on all sides.\n1. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, garlic and tomato paste diluted in broth or water.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes.\n1. Transfer the beef and onions to a crock pot and pour 1/2 the stout into the skillet.\n1. Heat to boiling and hold for 5 minutes, stirring well to deglaze the pan.\n1. Pour the sauce over the meat and add the carrots, potatoes and mushrooms.\n1. Cook on high for 3-4 hours, stirring occasionally.\n1. Approximately 30 minutes before serving add the rest of the stout to the pot and stir well.\n1. When done the stew should have a nice, heavy sauce on it without being too thick.  If sauce is too thick you can thin it with a bit of water.  If sauce is too thin dissolve 1 tsp of corn starch in 1 cup of cold water and add in small increments to the stew, stirring and allowing the sauce a couple of minutes to thicken.

{"title": "Drunken Chicken", "selftext": "I just noticed this sub and thought I'd share a recipe I just posted on AskReddit a few minutes ago. It's super easy.\n\nI use [Organic Ruby Ale](http://www.bcliquorstores.com/product/689497) and it tastes fantastic on its own.\n\nHere's a recipe that I have had much success with:\n\n**Drunken Chicken**\n\n1 chicken (preferably organic, nice and plump)\n\nseveral sticks of unsalted butter\n\n2 - 3 level tablespoons of granulated garlic (I like garlic so I use more)\n\n2 level tablespoons of lemon pepper\n\n2 level tablespoons of paprika\n\n1 level tablespoon of salt\n\ncouple sprigs of rosemary/oregano (fresh if at all possible), optional\n\n1 bottle of Organic Ruby Ale\n\nPreheat oven to 475 F. \n\nWash and dry your chicken. Gently separate the skin from the flesh of the breast and of the legs using your fingers.\n\nIn a small bowl, combine your salt and spices thoroughly. \n\nNext you will put some of the spice and butter underneath the skin of the chicken. You can either soften a few sticks of butter and mix this into your spices until it's well mixed and consistent, or you can take a little spice mix and rub a little under the skin of your chicken and then insert some butter under the skin afterward. Both works equally well. \n\nRub remaining spice mix (there should be quite a bit left over) all and inside the chicken. If you're using the fresh rosemary/oregano, put that inside the chicken at this point.\n\nPut chicken into roasting dish. Gently pour beer into the cavity of the chicken until it is full. If it pours out immediately try pinning the cavity shut with toothpicks so that at least some liquid is retained. Pour the rest of the bottle of beer around the chicken. \n\nPut roasting dish with your chicken into the oven. Lower temperature to 385 F. Roast for 1.5 hours, basting as necessary. \n\nWhen you remove the chicken from the oven, let it set for at least 10 - 15 minutes before carving, this will help keep it juicy. Cover it with tinfoil. \n\nTo make gravy, take the juices from the roasting dish, put them in a pan, and mix in two tablespoons of flour. Over medium heat, stir until the gravy is thick and even. \n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1blpsr/drunken_chicken/", "created_utc": 1365013393.0, "score": 14, "author": "None", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookwithbeer/comments/1blpsr/drunken_chicken/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes", "selftext": "Back at Thanksgiving I decided to give [Sean Paxton's Garlic IPA Mashed Potatoes](http://www.homebrewchef.com/RoastedGarlicIPAMashPotatoes.html) a whirl, but with a slight twist.\n\nI am re-printing his recipe as I used it here, but I encourage you to immediately visit his site for some amazing recipes and inspiration for cooking with beer. His [Home Brewed Chef podcast](http://thebrewingnetwork.com/shows/The-Home-Brewed-Chef) is worth checking out, too.\n\nI tried the cream/butter sauce on its own before adding the beer, and it was mild and a little bland. Once the Saison du BUFF was dropped in there, it was a difference of night and day. The spices from the beer stood out as if the sauce was well-seasoned on its own. These flavors were easily distinguished in the final product, too. The potatoes were an absolute hit.\n\n---\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled & cut into large chunks\n* 2 heads garlic\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 4 sprigs thyme\n* 1 cup unsalted butter\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 4 tbsp Dogfish Head Saison du BUFF\n* Sea salt\n* Black pepper\n\n---\n\n**Directions**\n\nSet your oven to 300\u00b0 F.\n\nPotatoes: \n\n1. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan or dutch oven with enough cold water to cover.\n2. Add enough salt to taste like ocean water and bring to a boil over high heat.\n3. Cook until tender, about 15 \u2013 20 minutes.\n4. Drain well.\n5. Press the potatoes through a ricer or mash them with a potato masher until smooth back into the same pot.\n\nGarlic paste:\n\n1. Take each head of garlic and remove as much of the papery outside skin as you can.\n2. With a sharp knife, cut the top 1/5 of the head off, exposing the tops of the garlic cloves.\n3. Take a small square piece of foil and place the cut head in the center.\n4. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil on top of each head then a sprig of thyme.\n5. Season with a touch of salt and pepper.\n6. Wrap each up and place in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the smell of garlic fills your kitchen.\n7. Remove from the oven, open each pouch and let cool for 5 minutes.\n8. Use a paper towel folded over a few times to act like a small potholder and squeeze the cloves out into a bowl\n9. Mash with a fork until smooth.\n\nSauce: \n\n1. In a medium pan, add butter, cream and 2 sprigs of thyme and turn heat to medium.\n2. Bring the mixture to a boil, turning down to low and simmer for 10 minutes.\n3. Remove the sprigs and add garlic paste and simmer another 3 minutes, using a whisk to stir and breakup the garlic.\n4. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper and add beer\n5.
