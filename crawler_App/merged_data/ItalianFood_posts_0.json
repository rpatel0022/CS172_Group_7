Couldn't find bucatini so I settled for thick spaghetti. Was really good. Used [this recipe](https://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Spaghetti-all-Amatriciana.html), but I doubled the amount of sauce (after taking the picture).\n\n3. \"Tonnarelli\" Cacio E Pepe. I don't have a _chitarra_, so I just made pasta dough, rolled it into sheets with my pasta maker, and tried cutting into \"square spaghetti\". Worked reasonably well. The sauce took a couple of tries; my pan apparently retains heat too well so the cheese kept clumping up. In the end I used the only pan I knew would cool down fast enough: my wok. And it finally worked.\n\n4. Rigatoni Alla Gricia. Took me three tries, and still failed. Screw this dish, haha.

This is my proven salt-to-water ratio. But if you like less salt, I assume 2 teaspoons per litre might be sufficient.)\n- Two minutes before the pasta is finished, take 15 ml of the pasta water and mix it into the egg-cheese mixture; repeat with another 15 ml\n- When the pasta is finished, take it with tongues directly from the pot into the still warm pan; put over the egg-cheese mixture and stir until creamy; add more pasta water if needed\n- Arrange it on a warm plate and sprinkle the guanciale over the pasta\n\nThe result: no scrambled eggs; super creamy texture.

{"title": "Bucatini all\u2019Amatriciana", "selftext": "OG authentic amatriciana uses only tomato, guanciale, pecorino, and black pepper. Traditionally served with rigatoni or bucatini. This is another one of the 4 classic Roman pasta dishes and is one of the first recorded Italian pasta dishes to use tomato. When I make my version for my private dinners I usually add some white wine and shallots, but that could be considered punishable by death depending on who you ask. \n\nTips:\n- Use top quality ingredients since there are so few in this dish. That means San Marzano or other high quality tomatoes, real imported Pecorino Romano, and imported guanciale. \n- If you can\u2019t find guanciale (cured pork cheek), pancetta will work as a substitute. \n- Render the pork slowly so that you get as much of the fat out as you can. This is what flavors the sauce.\n- Reduce the tomatoes at least by half. You want the tomatoes to be concentrated and to stick to the pasta.\n- The guanciale and the pecorino are salty. So taste the sauce before seasoning with more salt. \n- I like to add some freshly cracked black pepper in the beginning with the guanciale to fry in the fat and also some more fresh at the end. I forgot to film this though. \n- Turn the heat off when you add the cheese to the pan to help prevent it from sticking to the bottom.", "url": "https://v.redd.it/my0j5zg6kffa1", "created_utc": 1675175285.0, "score": 120, "author": "colucciocooks", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/10q0f53/bucatini_allamatriciana/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "American Donuts? No, these are Frati Fritti. A typical Carnival doughnut, initially Florentine and then adopted by Sardinia.", "selftext": "I had been looking for a recipe for good donuts for some time, I had actually tried to make them a couple of years ago but they had come out really inedible (they hadn't swelled, they weren't soft, they had even soaked in oil... a disaster).\n\nI don't fry very often at home (although when I do fry I do it for a few days and try lots of recipes all at once... and I love fried food) and I've improved my technique a lot only in the last year\n\n(both because I understood that temperature control is fundamental (before I would burn the oil or use it when it was still cold) and because now, almost always I use my fryer (that I got for like \u20ac30), rather than a pot\n\nthe temperature control is automatic and any pieces that end up on the bottom do not burn (since the resistance is in the middle rather than on the bottom).\n\n\n\nIn any case I didn't think I would ever find this recipe in the Italian tradition until chef Barbato published the recipe for Frati Fritti Sardi 1 month ago.\n\nGiven that I tried to look for the history but I didn't find much information about it, I'm happy to be able to publish it here as a recipe of the Italian tradition.\n\nSomeone might turn up their nose thinking that a similar recipe is too close to the American recipe for donuts, but frying dough during the Carnival period as a dessert is nothing so strange for Italian culture and\n\nit does not surprise me that there is a similar dessert (obviously without icing on top). In my own region Piedmont we got Bugie (that I will make tomorrow).\n\nFrom the ingredients however I think I can convince even the most skeptical because there is a classic ingredient of Italian cuisine: lard. I don't think any american recipe for donuts use pork fat in the dough.\n\n\n\nIn particular the ingredients are:\n\n300 gr of flour with 10/11 percentage of proteins\n\n150 gr of fresh whole milk\n\n1 medium whole egg\n\n10 gr of fresh brewer's yeast (4g dry)\n\n2 gr of baking powder\n\nthe grated peel of a lemon (optional)\n\nthe grated peel of an orange (optional)\n\n30 gr of lard\n\n35 gr of sugar\n\na pinch of salt\n\n20 gr of a liqueur that in Sardinia they call filu de ferru or acquavite di Sardegna. Not easy to find it can be replaced with a good myrtle (I still mean booze here) or in any case with a good liqueur.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nDissolve the brewer's yeast in the milk (if your yeast is fresh or dry but in small little balls... if it is very thin and can be added to the flour add it to the flour).\n\nPut the baking powder in the flour, mix... also add the salt, egg, sugar, egg, liqueur in the flour and any peels, mix, add the milk and mix until the flour is well hydrated or use the planetary mixer leaf.\n\nWork until the gluten network develops properly or use a no knead method alternating with folds/rests.\n\nAdd the lard.\n\nWork until the dough passes the veil test.\n\n\n\nLeave to rise for 3 hours or in any case until it triples in volume.\n\n\n\nRoll out the dough so as to eliminate as many air bubbles as possible with a little bit of flour. You can use a rolling pin.\n\n\n\nFold the dough lengthwise up and down so as to have a sort of \"flattened salami\" and divide into 6 portions of about 100g, form balls and, flouring, open the hole in the center nice and wide by sliding your fingers.\n\nKeep in mind that between leavening and cooking the hole will tend to close so if necessary widen 2-3 times so as to make relatively large holes.\n\n\n\nLet it rise for another 45 minutes.\n\n\n\nFry at 170\u00b0C for 4 minutes total, trying to do 2 minutes and 30 on one side, 1 and 30 on the other... the idea is to obtain a slightly darker part.\n\n\n\nDrop the still hot donut in the granulated sugar and serve.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgufxv", "created_utc": 1742598926.0, "score": 106, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1jgufxv/american_donuts_no_these_are_frati_fritti_a/", "html_title": ""}

Would it be terrible?\n\nI have embarked on this journey and have lived to tell the tale...\n\nThis was absolutely awesome.\n\nWas it better than using a bronze cut dried tonnarello or spaghetto? It was different.\n\nThe dough was simply water and semola, kneaded twice and rested once for 15 mins, ann then in the fridge overnight. Google the method for that, there are an abundance.\n\nRecipe below:\nFor 500g of bronze cut pasta, ideally spaghetti alla chitarra or tonnarelli:\n- 275g-300g of Pecorino Romano cheese (whole)\n- A handful of peppercorns\n\nStart by freshly grating room temperature pecorino romano cheese. The key here is that it needs to be grated with a microplace because of the way it renders the cheese very fine and fluffy, perfect for creating the creamy sauce. If you can't find a microplace, just a regular grater should do the trick. Set aside into a bowl.\n\nNext, toast your peppercorns on a medium heat whilst constantly swirling the pan (ensuring not to burn). For 2-3 mins until aromatic. Take off heat and put into mortar and pestle and grind straight away.\n\nBoil some water to boil. When boiling, add some salt (not too much because pecorino is already very salty). Take some cooking water and mix with some room temperature water to make it warm (around 50-60 degrees Celsius) and slowly start adding to pecorino to create a paste. Carefully not too add to much at a time and make sure it is all absorbed before adding more. Add some of the ground pepper as well, it should look like a cookies and cream ice cream paste almost - set aside.\n\nCook pasta to Al dente (like 30 seconds literally if fresh pasta) and then place the pasta into a spacious stainless steel bowl. Bring the pasta water down to low heat and wait about 1 min. Add a ladle of water to pasta, a generous helping of pepper and add also the cheese paste. Begin stirring vigorously with tongs and you will need to also \"mantecare\" the pasta here. Please google this as it is hard to explain this process but essentially, slowly, slowly, everything should start to come together and a delightful cream should begin forming. If too watery, add more cheese, if too wet, add more water. If it cools down too quick, add the bowl back to the pot of pasta water like a double boiler but please be careful with the heat as it can split the sauce. \nServe into a bowl and garnish with more pecorino and pepper and Buon appetito!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0gnhv", "created_utc": 1744797487.0, "score": 98, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1k0gnhv/cacio_e_pepe_con_pasta_fatta_in_casa/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Grandparents\u2019 families are from Grottaminarda. Attempted Neapolitan Lasagna for Easter.", "selftext": "I started Grandma\u2019s Sunday sauce recipe, which I usually make for the family now. We usually sear some sausages and classic meatballs and put them in. \n\nThis time, I had something special planned for the meatballs, so I left them out. Sausages only. \n\nIn addition, I chunked up a rack of ribs, seared them, and threw them in the sauce. \n\nIt cooked for several hours like normal, except this time, I paid special attention to whether the ribs were falling off the bone. \n\nThen, I took out the ribs and sausages and continued to simmer the sauce. \n\nThis is where things got tricky. I picked the meat off the ribs\u2014some had already fallen off. Then I put the cooked rib meat in the food processor and used it with our family meatball recipe\u2014except I made little tiny balls like wedding soup. My wife had to help me roll; I'm not patient enough. \n\nThen I fried them so they were crispy. \n\nNext, I sliced the cooked sausages into thin slices and cubed fresh mozzarella from the Italian market. I couldn't access Scamorza, so I used smoked mozzarella from the same market. \n\nThen, I used the market\u2019s fresh ricotta and mixed it with a little sauce. \n\nOnce the nice imported semolina noodles were done, the layering started. I also needed my wife\u2019s help here; she has a more delicate touch. \n\nIt was finished with fresh basil, sauce, and the hard cheese we chose for the whole recipe, which was new to us: bufala hard cheese from Lombiadia. And yes, it had an amazing flavor. \n\nBaked at 375\u00b0F for 30 minutes with foil tight.

Whilst this is happening, chop your tomatoes; Chery tomato in half, dice the San Marzano (not tiny) and add to the pan once onion is ready.

Pass through a sieve to remove seeds and skin, catching the sauce back in the pan. Get back onto a low heat and throw your pasta into pot, will only take about 1 min if pasta is fresh.

Then it is filled (in my case with cooked ham and smoked scamorza), closed, put back in the heat (the oven just turned off) and left just long enough for the cheese inside to start to melt. \n\nAs you can see from the photo, the upper and lower parts did not come out perfect. I had some trouble moving the already spread out upper part over the other piece, the result is a shape that is not exactly square... but shape aside I think it came out very well, the perfect leavening created a soft interior, while the outside became nice and crunchy thanks also to the olive oil, the two parts separated without problems as expected and the taste was out of this world.\n\nIf you are curious I recommend trying this little trick the next time you want to make a focaccia or stuffed pizza.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ketp0t", "created_utc": 1746390845.0, "score": 9, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1ketp0t/pizza_baciata/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Bonet", "selftext": "One of the few recipes for which I use giallo zafferano as a source\n\nJust be careful about a couple of things: \n\n1. If you want caramel (but I don't recommend it, it's delicious even without it) do it at the end and simply pour it on top, otherwise you'll get a quintal of it and if it crystallizes (with the giallozafferano recipe that doesn't use honey or glucose or any other inverted sugar, crystallization is always around the corner) then it will stick to the mold... Pouring it at the end is the same, it's more convenient, you pour the right amount and even if it crystallizes it would be a thin layer. \n\nNote: to make caramel you need to heat sugar and water (which then evaporates) up to 160\u00b0C. If you add an inverted sugar like honey it will remain liquid. \n\n2. Cook for at least 1 hour, but if you have a thermometer, it's even better to measure the core temperature at 90\u00b0C (with the doses of giallozafferano it takes about 1 hour). \n\n3. Do not turn it over unless it has been at room temperature for 2 hours + at least 1 hour in the fridge... never turn it over before. \n\n4. If you put baking paper in the mold, it will be much easier to turn it over. \n\n5. Since you have to cook in a bain-marie, prepare the water first, otherwise it will have to boil in the oven and will take much longer to cook. \n\nBonet is one of the simplest but best recipes of Piedmontese cuisine, it can be prepared in 10 minutes and then it only needs to cook on its own, just mix all the ingredients (add the crushed amaretti at the last minute) \n\nthe ingredients are these: \n\nAmaretti 200 g \n\nBitter cocoa powder 35 g \n\nEgg yolks (medium) 1 \n\nWhole milk 500 g \n\nSugar 150 g Eggs (medium) \n\n A pinch of fine salt \n\na drop of liqueur \n\nand the only thing you may not have in the pantry are the amaretti (but if you have almond flour or almonds to grind and some bitter almonds or at least bitter almond flavor you are on the right track).

{"title": "Colomba (panettone-like sourdough sweet bread for easter italy)", "selftext": "I already made it last year so you can find the recipe in english here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalianFood/comments/1bsyhmm/traditional\\_colomba\\_pasquale\\_of\\_course\\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalianFood/comments/1bsyhmm/traditional_colomba_pasquale_of_course_with/)\n\nBut this year I used the new version from Barbato for the process and the almond icing:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPnW0AzakQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPnW0AzakQ)\n\nBasically a little bit more egg white to keep it more stable and avoid the problem of it going wet during the rest period.\n\nI think the result was much better... I only got 1 little problem, I used too much icing so on the colomba it detached a little bit during the upside down resting (you can notice it in the final photo the one from inside the colomba), it need to break evenly so that there is not too much heavy icing but it only expanded at the sides and set on top in one piece, it still did not break completely so at the end of the day it was still good looking. Also unlike last year the crumb inside is even, I did not get a large bubble on the center. I paid a lot of attention to avoid to create it when doing the cross (made to shape it like a \"dove\").\n\nUnlike Barbato I still used my current lievito madre (a stiff sourdough starter) so I needed a lot more time, but the taste is amazing.\n\nI had to wait one week to share the photo since you need to wait for it this much to get the best aroma, and yesterday I finally made a lot of photo of the inside.\n\nI actually only kept the tree shaped colomba (not a traditional shape but I got only one proper colomba mold so I decided to use another strange mold that was available thanks to my mother that got it at christmas and did not use it) I gifted the colomba to my nonna so I only got 1 photo of the inside of the colomba but the dough is the same for both.\n\nLike you can see from the recipe ingredients it require a lot of egg yolks, butter, sugar and you need to incorporate them in two stages, it will need a really strong gluten network and a really strong flour to keep it together, pay a lot of attention to temperature control and, if you, like me, used lievito madre (a stiff sourdough starter) remember that it need to be a lot sweeter than when used for bread, it will need a lot of hours of fermentations so it will acidify little by little and if it start at a 4.5 ph it will be too acidic, while a 5 ph should be good (if you don't have a ph meter just taste it). If this is your first grande lievitato start making it with regular yeast, it will be easier, faster and if you make any mistakes you will learn a lot, once you master it using sourdough starter is only a matter of waiting more time and refresh it about 3 times before starting the recipe.\n\nIf you never tasted it homemade/artisianal it's an experience that you need.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4hu6x", "created_utc": 1745253318.0, "score": 9, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1k4hu6x/colomba_panettonelike_sourdough_sweet_bread_for/", "html_title": ""}

It was really good and a change from anything Italian I have had before.\n\n  \nI found this recipe online it is by Chef Billy Parisi.  What I also found is one of my objections to recipes online and in particular Italian recipes which are supposed to be perfected and preserved and not modified.\n\nUnder Pasta al Limone I found a variety of recipes and the most, IMO, egregious are the ones with garlic or cream.  \n\nTell me if I am wrong but they don't seem necessary or correct to me.\n\n\n\n# Pasta al Limone recipe\n\nThis creamy lemon-filled Pasta al Limone recipe is a delicious easy-to-make pasta loaded with pecorino cheese and tossed with spaghetti.\n\n**Servings:** \n\n**Prep Time:**5minutes\u00a0minutes\n\n**Cook Time:**15minutes\u00a0minutes\n\n# Ingredients\u00a0US\n\n* 3\u00a0tablespoons\u00a0olive oil\n* 6\u00a0tablespoons\u00a0unsalted butter\n* Zest of 4 lemons\n* Juice of 4 lemons,\u00a0; this should total close to a 1/4 cup\n* 1\u00a0cup\u00a0packed freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese + more for garnish\n* 1\u00a0pound\u00a0dried spaghetti pasta\n* coarse salt and pepper to taste\n\n# Instructions\n\n* Add the oil and butter to a large saucepan and heat over low to medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes.\n* Next, add in \u00bd of the lemon zest and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to help release some of the lemon flavor. This pasta has big bright, bold lemon flavors. If you want to tone it down, use the zest and the juice from 3 small to medium-sized lemons.\n* AD\n* Pour in \u00bd of the lemon juice and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to concentrate the flavors of the lemon even more.\n* Set the pan aside.\n* Drop the dried pasta into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook for 7 to 8 minutes or until al dente.\n* Next, drain the pasta and add it to the lemon butter saucepan.\n* Immediately add \u00bd cup of the hot pasta water along with the remaining lemon juice, lemon zest (reserve a little bit for garnish), cheese, salt, and pepper.\n* Toss the pasta repeatedly and vigorously to melt the cheese and emulsify it with hot water and pasta to make it creamy. The sauce should not break or be stringy. If you are nervous that the sauce will not come together, start by sprinkling in and tossing the pasta with half of the cheese. Once it\u2019s mixed in, toss it with the remaining cheese.\n* Add the pasta to a bowl and serve it with additional cheese and lemon zest.\n\n# Notes\n\n**Make-Ahead:**\u00a0This is meant to be eaten as soon as it is finished being made.**How to Store:**\u00a0Cover the pasta and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. This will not freeze well.**How to Reheat:**\u00a0Add the desired amount of pasta to a medium-sized saucepot and add in 2 to 3 tablespoons of water, and heat over low to medium heat while continually gently stirring with a spoon until hot.

{"title": "Homemade Whey Ricotta", "selftext": "Premise: making it at home is a long process, the result is never 100% guaranteed and it costs much less to buy it (I'm talking about the artisanal one with quality equal to this one). But if you ever have the chance to try making cheese instead of throwing away the whey, try making ricotta, you won't regret it. \n\nHomemade ricotta, like the artisanal one, is soft and creamy but not like the one from the supermarket (to which they seem to have added cream or creamcheese) but rather it is made up of many small granules that melt in your mouth. A super delight that can also be eaten hot (freshly made and if you've never tried it, my advice is to try it like this too, just wait for it to drain and be lukewarm) but it is best served cold. \n\nAfter making the cheese (at the beginning of the process anyway... for example I made this ricotta with the whey from mozzarella/scamorze that I wanted to make... but if I had taken the whey at the end of the process it would have been too acidic to be able to obtain the ricotta) recover the whey and heat it up to 65\u00b0C at that point add 10% of the weight of the whey in reinforcement milk little by little (without dropping the temperature) and 1.5g per kg of whey in salt. Up to 65\u00b0C mix on a high flame (the whey does not burn on the bottom like milk) after finishing adding the milk lower the flame to a minimum and mix very slowly making sure that nothing sticks to the bottom. Once the whey reach 85\u00b0C stop mixing and at 90\u00b0C turn off the flame and cover with a lid for 2 minutes. \n\nIf after 2 minutes you don't see any ricotta flakes it means that the pH is still too high (probably around 6.4) so \u200b\u200badd a little bit of vinegar (preferably apple cider vinegar) or lemon juice or even citric acid (but follow other recipes for this, I don't have the doses and citric acid need very specific doses while I eyeball vinegar), mix and wait a few seconds. If the ricotta flakes start to form, cover and wait another 2 minutes, otherwise add another drop of vinegar (always be conservative). If you have a pH meter you should see a pH around 5.7 (keep in mind that the pH lowers with the higher temperature so if you started with a whey at 6.1 (ideal for ricotta) you probably wouldn't have added vinegar, but if you start with a pH that's too low or if you add too much vinegar the ricotta flakes will become very thin and impossible to collect so be very careful). \n\nTurn the flame back on to the minimum so as to bring the temperature back to 90-92\u00b0C (when you reach it, turn it off) and in the meantime remove the ricotta that has already surfaced at the beginning (when it is more delicate) with a spoon to place on the bottom of the ricotta basket, then you can start to collect it always delicately with another ricotta basket (they are the perforated ones in which they usually sell artisanal ricotta). Collect everything you can collect. The yield is almost always quite low (between 6 and 12% of the weight of the whey). \n\nFor example, I started with 4.5 liters of milk, I obtained 4 liters of whey and I added 0.4 liters of milk. From which I obtained only 260g of drained ricotta (the one in the photo is a little less because I had my parents taste it and I also took a spoonful before turning it upside down and taking the photo). The milk I used is raw cow's milk (raw milk is the only one suitable without any particular additives to make traditional fiordilatte mozzarella), but the distributor I have near my house (the only one left in the area) has the characteristic of being quite low fat (in fact once I tried to make the cream and I realized that it didn't whip so it had a percentage of fat closer to that of cooking cream than to that suitable for whipping). \n\nUltimately the milk I have available is not the best possible but even so the ricotta still comes out very good. \n\nPlease note: ricotta can also be made with the whey derived from the processing of pasteurized milk, so anyone can make it. The only thing is that given the extremely low yield it is not economically convenient compared to buying artisanal given the work that goes into it and the fact that you always have to make cheese first. \n\nIt takes about 20-25 liters of milk to obtain 1kg of ricotta. And artisanal ricotta, the good kind (at least here in Italy) costs between 7 and 15\u20ac per kg. While 20 liters of milk range from about \u20ac20 to \u20ac35 per kg. It is true that making ricotta also produces cheese, but if you only want ricotta, it is much quicker to buy it. \n\nJust a tip: buy it from a cheesemaker, good ricotta is a whole other thing compared to the packaged kind from the supermarket. \n\nNote: if you need a ricotta-like cheese for desserts (for example a ricotta cheesecake), or in any case the ricotta is mixed with sugar and sieved, you can also make novella. Novella is made starting directly from milk and acidifying with vinegar or lemon. Unlike ricotta, it should not be salted (or should be salted very little, much less than ricotta) you should use a little more vinegar/lemon but still do not overdo it (I have seen recipes that used 10x the necessary quantity, the result was not good), always go in a thin drop and wait for the ricotta mixed with curd to emerge. Novella is not as good as ricotta eaten like this because it is much more rubbery (the pieces of curd have this rubbery effect) but in desserts and if you pass it through a sieve you will notice this defect much less. The yield is something like 50%, so 5-10x higher than the quantity of ricotta obtained, a very high yield but at the cost of having a decidedly less good product.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/2bjxhgkk4wre1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1743371485.0, "score": 20, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1jnnnlm/homemade_whey_ricotta/", "html_title": ""}

Ok.\n\nSo ... pasta seems important. Historically I admit I've focused on price when I shop, and I'm uncertain what to look for as I try to buy better pasta, say for that Pasta con Aglio e Olio recipe I'm interested in.\n\nI welcome your collective wisdom!\n\n\\*\\*\\* Response summary (for readers convenience): \\*\\*\\*\n\nFirst, ingredients. Look to confirm the pasta is 100% Drum Semolina, and avoid additives. Quality pasta from quality ingredients!\n\nNext, choose bronze-drawn. Non bronze drawn will be cheaper, with a smooth, non-textured surface and usually has a dark yellow color (and sometimes blacks flecks, which is burned sugar), owing to drying quickly at very high temperatures. Bronze-drawn pasta (pasta extruded through bronze dies) will have a rough texture which provides a better mouth-feel and encourages sauce adhesion. Generally this pasta has been dried for a longer period of time (24 - 48 hours) using milder heat, resulting in a light amber to ivory color.\n\nOne can also segment the pasta market into three segments which I'll call consumer, entry level, and premium.\n\nConsumer level pasta is often made with wheat other than drum semolina, often contains additivies, and is usuall not bronze drawn (or cut), Avoid it.\n\nEntry Level (bronze drawn) pasta, likely all most of us will need, includes brands such as Rummo, De Cecco, La Molisana, Pastificio Liguori, Pastificio di Martino, Garafalo, and Rao\u2019s.\n\nPremium Level includes brands such as Monograno Felicetti, Rustichella D\u2019Abruzzo, Afeltra, and Mancini.\n\nItalian DOP or IGP certification may suggest higher quality, as may indications that pasta has come from regions such as Gragnano ... long known for its pasta craftsmanship.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalianFood/comments/1jlv0c1/good_commercially_avilable_pasta/", "created_utc": 1743168302.0, "score": 5, "author": "fheathyr", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1jlv0c1/good_commercially_avilable_pasta/", "html_title": ""}

Unfortunately there aren\u2019t any pictures of it from our trip and descriptions online don\u2019t seem to match up right.\n\nThe pastry was triangle-shaped like a pizza slice.

We tried a flavor like raspberry, another like blackberry, another like a sweet fragrant lemon. The fruits weren\u2019t completely emulsified, so it was a chunky not 100% smooth texture.\n\nThe dough was firm enough to hold its shape but soft to the bite even after surviving days in the fridge.

{"title": "Drunken Spaghetti", "selftext": "One of the few channels with a traditional approach to cooking that I follow is Pasta Grammar because they make so many regional dishes that I simply don't know. One of these is Spaghetti Ubriachi that I made today. \n\nThe recipe is so simple that it's almost trivial, in fact the heart of the recipe is reduced to pasta risottata in red wine and, when the latter starts to run out, possibly add a little bit of warm water. \n\nJust make the usual soffritto (I did it with extra virgin olive oil and shallot, pasta grammar used garlic instead of shallot), add the wine, a bay leaf, salt, cook the spaghetti adding water if necessary (assume that you will need it) until cooked, making sure that the creamy sauce forms due to the starch released by the pasta. At the end of cooking add a small knob of butter, and finally parmesan, stir and serve. Obviously the first thing that catches the eye is the truly particular color and obviously the aroma is particularly pleasant. But there are two other factors that make this dish really interesting. The consistency of the spaghetti and the flavor of the sauce. \n\nSpaghetti cooked in wine have a particular consistency, a little more al dente than pasta cooked in water. But the most surprising thing is definitely the flavor of the sauce that tastes more like roast than wine (even without using meat). \n\nFor me (I don't drink wine but uses it in cooking) I think it's one of the most interesting recipes I've made in recent years... and it's also extremely simple, the only thing is that it uses about 125/250g of red wine so it's not extremely cheap (and the wine has to be decent otherwise the flavor of the pasta will be as horrible as the horrible wine used since it doesn't evaporate completely but it is absorbed by the pasta, so use a good wine).", "url": "https://i.redd.it/psy2d06l0nqe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742822211.0, "score": 0, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1jiqf4o/drunken_spaghetti/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Making your own pasta", "selftext": "For Italians here - is making your own pasta a big thing for you or your family? In my experience (born and raised in Rome), not. It\u2019s something people may do very occasionally but 99.9% of the time they use dried pasta, that you can\u2019t really make at home. It may be different in Emilia where people eat a lot of fresh egg-based pasta, and maybe it was different 100 years ago - but the diet and food of those days have little to do with today\u2019s. \n\nSo I\u2019m quite baffled at foreign Italy-loving \u2018foodies\u2019 who make a big thing of making their own pasta, as if shop-bought was by definition inferior, or tourists that come to Rome and do a pasta-making class. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fun but it\u2019s not a typical part of domestic life in Roman families, or even classic food we eat all the time. \n\nYou also see it in tourist restaurants like Da Fortunata which put \u2018grannies\u2019 rolling pasta in the window. That doesn\u2019t look authentic at all to me - the grannies often look east European for a start. Of course over time the boundaries may well blur and it could be imported as a local \u2018custom\u2019, if it\u2019s happened with Chinese all you can eat sushi places.\n\nFor clarity I have nothing against making fresh pasta - some of my best friends are homemade fettuccine - but I question the implication of authenticity and quintessential italian-ness that it comes with.

{"title": "Californian seeking understanding", "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nSo for some context in California people tend to care a lot about food a quality, fresh ingredients proper techniques etc. However, there is not much of an emphasis on traditional recipes and dishes being made a certain way. For example there is a traditional seafood stew called Cioppino that has been around for over 100 years and is tomato based \n\nHowever if a chef wanted to serve say \u201cgreen\u201d Cioppino using an herb blend instead, while not authentic I can imagine anyone having an issue with the naming or variation.\n\nPlease forgive me if I misunderstand but my perception of Italian cooking is that certain dishes are made a certain way with certain ingredients and big variations in ingredients or how it\u2019s served is not favored.\n\nFor me, this is very different perspective than what I am used to, which is more \u201cif it\u2019s good what the problem.\u201d For another example recently there has been a tend of making traditional California burritos with sushi rice. Yet there no outcry from either the Hispanic or Japanese  communities.\n\nCould some explain the Italian perspective? Is it more about preserving the dishes or that \u201cCarbonara\u201d has a specific meaning and anything outside of that is not it?\n\nOr for another example, if someone likes serving a pasta and sauce that are not traditionally combined, what is the issue?\n\nI\u2019m truly just trying to understand a different food culture from my own and would appreciate some education.

{"title": "Rag\u00f9", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI'm French and have been a fan of Italian food ever since I was young. Some years ago, on a trip to Bologna, I learned about \"al rag\u00f9\" as a more traditional (and refined) version of what we call in France \"sauce Bolognaise,\" and I\u2019ve been cooking it frequently ever since.\n\nRecently, I wanted to share my variation of the recipe with a friend. To do so, I first tried to find a recipe online to use as a reference. However, the recipes I found typically use minced veal, beef, or pork as the meat base. This differs from my version, where I rely on the meat breaking down into shreds after very slow cooking. This method results in a texture similar to minced meat but avoids the grinding process and retains part of the meat's original structure. After the long cooking process, I simply press the meat into the sauce regularly, which causes it to gradually shred and integrate into a uniform sauce.\n\nTo my surprise, I couldn\u2019t find any recipes in my language or in English that use this method, despite extensive searches (though I am almost certain I learned this technique from a recipe in the past). \n\nI\u2019m now wondering if I completely imagined this and it was never used traditionally for this sauce, or if I simply haven\u2019t searched well enough\u2014or perhaps this tip was shared directly with me by an Italian and the method does exist and is known?\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalianFood/comments/1gv1zt2/rag\u00f9/", "created_utc": 1732035654.0, "score": 16, "author": "Pangolin_Aware", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1gv1zt2/rag\u00f9/", "html_title": ""}

It\u2019s still a cheeseburger, putting cake on it does not change that. \n\nYou see, if someone doesn\u2019t put cheese on it, then common sense states that it isn\u2019t a cheeseburger, because there is no cheese. So it is just a hamburger. That\u2019s as far as that goes, no one is going to be a stickler about what ingredients you put on it. It\u2019s more about what you remove, and less about what you add. But Italians will treat every dish like that. As soon as you add ONE topping to a pizza that they don\u2019t approve of, it automatically is no longer pizza to them. That is just so silly to me. And simply incorrect. \n\nIf you go to the Four Corners Monument in the USA, and have one foot in Utah, just because you put your other foot in Colorado, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still in Utah. So just because you add one or two ingredients to a dish, that doesn\u2019t just completely make it a different dish. It\u2019s still the same dish, with a little something else added to it.

Sweat the mixture over a low heat for 15 minutes.\n\nMix a half glass of chicken stock with a teaspoon of tomato puree, add to pan and cook over a medium heat for 15 minutes. Add two tablespoons of passata, a full glass of dry red wine (look for a good, well aged chianti classico for a subtle leathery quality) and 50ml milk. Keep the mixture moving for 10 minutes or so before covering and reducing over a low heat for 2 hours. Remove the lid and add 50ml milk every half hour until around 200ml has been used.\n\nOnce reduced, at this point the sauce should still be reasonably thin/watery. Boil a serving of dried cavatelli in salted water until rehydrated, not cooked; this should take around 7 minutes. Drain but leave a small amount of pasta water, and cover with sauce, then cover and steam over low heat until al dente. The part cooked pasta still has room to soak up moisture, and will handle the thinness of the sauce.\n\nYou should be left with a serving of pasta that is light in consistency, yet rich, spicy and smoky and absolutely no longer watery. You may wish to add garlic earlier in the process; I find that this overpowers the smoky/leathery subtleties but do your thing! Serve with torn basil and pecorino. Cheerssss.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8dry1gmcrwd1.jpg?width=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef6d6ebe49a8086622e15dca41bee58c9d33a9a7\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalianFood/comments/1gbbkdb/cavatelli_with_a_lighter_smoked_pancetta_and/", "created_utc": 1729799287.0, "score": 14, "author": "Clark_Snapper", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/ItalianFood/comments/1gbbkdb/cavatelli_with_a_lighter_smoked_pancetta_and/", "html_title": ""}
