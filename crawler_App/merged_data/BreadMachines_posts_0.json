I make butter and whipped cream (or anything that involves agitating heavy cream) by shaking a mason jar. Or having my babies shake it. I wont buy a deep fryer when i can do it all manually with cast iron and a thermometer. Usually its the cost of these tools that turns me off, but it can also be the size because i put a lot of thought into long term storage before i buy anything. But really, if i can make something by hand i prefer to do it that way to maintain control over every part. Kind of like how i prefer a manual transmission to automatic in a car. But at least youve found a way to get a lot more use out of what is typically a very large and expensive one trick pony machine"]}

{"title": "Useful prospective / new bread machine owner info / FAQ", "selftext": "**Do I need/want a bread machine?**\n\nBread machines are great for people who have space on a countertop or sturdy table for a machine, don't want to waste a lot of time kneading and waiting around for rises and baking, and want relatively inexpensive, fresh bread.\n\nIf you're a regular baker, you probably didn't even make it this far. That's fine. Bread made by hand is awesome, just a bit more time consuming.\n\nBread machines are sort of like rice cookers; convenience and consistency machines. If they help you save money by making your own bread, or get you started on the path of learning about / doing more baking and cooking, or gets you eating better because you're not eating wonderbread or McDonalds all the time, then as the Fonz says: eeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.\n\n**Buying a bread machine**\n\nThe first rule of /r/breadmachines is that you do not buy a new bread machine. They basically all do the same two things: move the stuff in the pan around, and heat the stuff in the pan. Companies figured out how to reliably do this about two decades ago, and this simplicity makes it fairly easy to test used units for proper functioning. $100 would buy you a VERY nice new bread machine right now. You can watch specials for a fair bit less...or...\n\nBread machines were bought like crazy as gifts. As a result, there's a steady stream of bread machines popping up in thrift stores. Buy yours from a thrift store that allows you to plug it in before buying, and/or has an *appliance* return policy of at least a day. **It should cost you $20 or less.**\n\n* At a bare minimum you need the machine, the bread pan, and **the paddle** that goes on the shaft inside the pan. The owner's manual is very helpful, although with many machines, it's not exactly rocket science how to set the cycle type and loaf size. Often the basic functions are printed on the control panel. For newer machines, you may be able to find a PDF online, but don't count on it.\n* Inspect the pan. The non-stick surface inside should be nearly flawless, and pretty clean.\n* Plug in the machine and turn it on (many are \"on\" all the time; press the button for loaf type first, then try the loaf size button, then try the start/stop if neither of those turns on the display.)\n* Pick a cycle, any cycle, and hit go. The machine should start moving the paddle in fits and starts. That's normal; this is the mix&knead.\n* Stop the cycle (mashing the start/stop button, or holding it, should do the trick; unplugging it probably won't, as many machines have some sort of battery backup to resume a cycle after a power failure) and try to figure out how to start a bake-only cycle (they also have knead-only cycles, many have jam cycles, etc.) Wait a minute, open the top, and see if heat is coming from the coil. Note that some smoke *may* be normal, either from sloppiness of the prior owner or manufacturing oils if it's never-before-used.\n\nAge of the machine isn't really important. My machine is a Breadman so old it included a VHS cassette tape in addition to the manual and recipe booklet. It's made a bunch of beautiful, yummy bread.\n\nPaddle operation is important; if the unit looks heavily used, the drive belt for the paddle may be coming apart. If you hear suspect noises, maybe wait for the next machine, or soon as you get home, pull off the bottom cover and inspect the belt. Return it if it's damaged; the cost of a belt may be a good chunk of what a different, functioning machine costs.\n\nWhole wheat breads are generally more nutritious and flavorful, but they also work best with a different cycle than white bread; generally, the machine waits much longer for the moisture in the dough to soak into the flour. Check to see if the machine has a whole wheat setting, if this matters to you.\n\n**What are reputable brands?**\n\nPanasonic, Zojirushi and Breadman are among many other brands which work fine. It may be easier to have an \"avoid\" list. TBD / input requested.\n\n**What are some of the fancier features?**\n\nIn order from common to unusual:\n\n* Delay timers. Delay the bread such that it will finish right around when you plan to be awake or home, because you want to remove it from the machine and pan right at the end of the cycle.\n* 'Battery' backup in case you unplug the machine during a cycle or the power goes out briefly. A fair number of machines have this. Your backup may be totally 100% dead if it was made in a different decade, FYI.\n* Beeping during the part of the cycle you can most appropriately add your fruit or nuts.\n* Nut/fruit, or yeast dispensers. Yeast dispensers are silly; just make a divot in the flour and drop the yeast in there if you're using the delay cycle. Nut/fruit dispensers are slightly more useful if you're never around early on in the cycle.\n* Convection baking. Yawn. The standard coil-around-the-pan seems to work pretty well.\n* Folding paddles. These fold flat before the bake cycle, leaving less of a divot in the final loaf. Yawn.\n\n\n**Your first loaf**\n\nStart with a basic white/French loaf that comes with the machine, and the smallest loaf size. There's less to go wrong, and it requires very few ingredients, handy for people dipping their toes in this.\n\nPlan for the cycle taking about 3-4 hours; more towards 3 for white bread, more towards 4 for whole wheat. Some machines are faster, or have a \"rapid\" cycle. For your first loaves, don't use the rapid cycle. Stick around and enjoy the nice yeasty (during the rise) and AWESOME baking-bread smells. And to make sure you can provide or request fire suppression services for your abode in the extremely unlikely event your $20 thrift store bread machine commits harakiri.\n\nIf your yeast is suspect, test it; there are instructions online for doing this. Or, if you'd like to eliminate it as a variable, buy a small packet of yeast (if you regularly bake bread, you will want to buy a jar - it is FAR cheaper per-volume! However, do not buy blocks of yeast; that yeast will not activate quickly enough for use in a bread machine.)\n\nBuy fresh flour if you have any doubts about how old/good your flour is; do not use flour that has gone rancid (whole wheat flours go rancid fairly quickly and should be stored in your fridge or in the coolest, driest part of your kitchen, in an airtight container.) Use the proper types called for; do not substitute different kinds of flours! They have different gluten contents and other properties.\n\nIf the machine is of unknown provenance, dust/shake/vacuum out/wipe down the baking area and run a bake-only cycle first with nothing in the machine. Some brand new machines might have some manufacturing oils or whatnot on them that need to be burned off. Be prepared for a bit of smoke. Thoroughly wash the pan. Do NOT put it in your dishwasher; dishwasher detergent will damage the aluminum bits, the seals on the shaft, the nonstick coating on the pan which is very, very important, etc.\n\n* Position the paddle if instructed as such in the manual.\n* Water is important. More specifically, use the temperature called for by the recipe, and use water that has either sat for 12-24 hours or has been boiled - both will dechlorinate the water. Chlorination in the water will hamper the yeast.\n* Salt is important too - namely, not having too much (which will hamper the rise of the yeast.) If the recipe calls for \"salt\", the author almost certainly means **table** salt, not sea salt or kosher salt. If you use a different kind of salt, it probably has a different volume-to-weight ratio and must be converted. Google is your friend. Believe it or not, but even the *brand* of kosher salt affects the volume-to-weight ratio.\n* Liquids typically go first (very often salt, if called for, goes in with the liquid as well) then the dry stuff goes on top. This keeps the machine from creating a ball of flour concrete in the first seconds of mixage, and then burning out the motor. **Some machines recommend a different order. Use the order specified in your owner's manual.**\n* You want each ingredient well-spread-out around the pan; don't obsess, but don't just dump them in the middle. The exception: if you're doing a time-delay start, you do want a bit of a flour pile in the center to help keep the yeast dry.\n* Yeast almost always goes last. If you're immediately starting the machine, sprinkle it evenly all around the pan on top of the flour. If you're using time delay, poke your finger into the middle of the flour pile, wiggle it around to make a golf-ball-sized divot, and plop the yeast in there. The goal is to keep the yeast dry until the machine starts.\n* Most pans use something of a bayonet style mount. Check that the pan is locked in place by trying to pull up.\n* Close top, select the proper loaf size, **select the proper cycle**, press go, and be amused at all the weird whum-whum-whum-whiiiiiiirrrrr noises coming from your machine. Note that the machine does kinda 'throw its weight around' a bit; a sturdy table, counter, or the floor is best.\n* Post a photo of both that handsome/beautiful loaf and your machine, brag about how you totally did score it at the thrift store for =<$20, etc.\n\nPROTIP: **Measuring by weight is generally faster, more accurate/repeatable, and cleaner. No, really.** A magazine asked twelve experienced bakers to measure out a cup of flour and they varied by 10%. A gram-accurate scale will get you to less than 1%, repeatably. You don't need it for your first loaf, but consider buying a digital kitchen scale; you won't regret it for this, or other cooking/baking endeavors. In combination with the sudden proliferation of powdery white stuff all over you, the kitchen, etc, this also makes for great drug dealer jokes with your roommates, the local constabulary, etc. Look up the weights of the different ingredients (even water!) and pencil in the gram equivalents in the recipe book (yes, grams.) Turn on the scale, place the pan on the scale, zero/tare the sale. After measuring each ingredient into the pan, re-zero. You'll probably still want to use a measuring spoon for really light-weight stuff like yeast, salt, etc.\n\n**OMGWTFBBQ why is my machine beeping like crazy mid-cycle?**\n\nThat's the add-your-nuts (or fruit) beeper. Congrats, your machine has a nuts-and-fruit beeper feature!\n\n**Post-baking cycle**\n\n* Unplug the machine or 'clear' the display, as some machines have a post-bake \"keep warm\" cycle (Breadman machines, for example.)\n* Remove the loaf as soon as possible from the machine, and remove the loaf from the pan as soon as possible (you're going to want at least two decent oven mits for this.) The paddle comes out of the loaf better while the bread is still hot, and the loaf needs to release excess moisture.\n* Place the loaf on a cooling rack, oriented the same way it was in the machine. It's too soft to support its own weight any other way.\n* Leave it alone for at least an hour. Bread needs to release all the excess moisture, and \"rest\", like almost all baked goods. I found a loaf of raisin bread I baked lost a gram of moisture about every 30 seconds or so as it sat cooling!\n\n**Storing your delicious bread**\n\n* *Step away from the refrigerator and nobody gets hurt.*\n* Once it has cooled, put it on the counter. Done!\n* Don't cut into the loaf until you need to; the life of the loaf drops dramatically once you do.\n* Place the cut end of the loaf face-down on a board, clean countertop, or plate. Done. Leave it alone. If you live in an area with dry weather and your bread dries out very quickly, store it in a plastic ziplock bag *after it has rested overnight*.

If you have chlorinated water (many places do), allow the water to sit at room temperature for a few hours to allow the chlorine to offgass, or boil it and then let it sit. I found this helpful to making my loaves (and many baked goods) more consistent. I keep my electric kettle 3/4 full of water that's been boiled once, precisely for baking and cooking, but a pitcher on the counter works fine too.\n* Co-ops, and sometimes other markets, offer bulk flour and basic baking essentials at cheaper prices than the prepackaged stuff. The downside is that if it's not undergoing heavy use, it may not be rotating that often, and may be rancid.\n* Store yeast in sealed containers in the fridge or freezer.\n* Store oils away from light and heat; flour/grains should, in addition to being kept away from light and heat, be stored in airtight containers. Whole wheat flour should be stored in a very airtight container in your fridge or freezer.\n* Olive oil can be substituted 1:1 for vegetable oil in most recipes and is a bit better for you, adds a little bit of flavor, etc.\n\n\n(suggestions welcome.

Then you know when you can remove the paddle, reshape the loaf, or even remove it from the machine and cook the loaf in your oven. \n\nI generally use the Basic 1.5lb loaf cycle on my machine and have a notecard taped inside a cabinet with the times for that and the 2lb cycle.  If I'll be home while the bread machine is running, I set an alarm so I can remove the paddle at the correct time. \n\n-Keep a silicone spatula handy so that you can push any flour that's clinging to the corners of the machine down into the dough ball that's forming during the mixing cycle. \n\n-Check on the dough in the first 5-10 minutes of mixing. It should be approaching a smooth ball shape. If it's really shaggy and not coming together, it needs a little more liquid. Add a teaspoon or two at a time, give it time to be absorbed and check again. If it looks like oatmeal or is sticking to the sides of the machine, it's too wet and needs more flour. Add in small amounts and recheck.  Normal variations in temperature and humidity of your kitchen can make your standard recipe a little too dry or too wet, as can minor changes in measuring ingredients.  You didn't do anything \"wrong\" if you need to make an adjustment--it's perfectly normal and expected!", "I also like my bread machine because it is hard to find bread compatible with my diabetes.

Don't want to get it hot, just a bit warm. Like, think of that celebrity that everyone thinks is pretty hot, but you just think is O.K. you know?

Bonus points if you wave your hands around and wear a cape. Don't have to, but that's how I like it.\n\nShape it by rolling it out, then rolling it up and closing the seam with some pinchy pinchy. Should look a bit like [this I guess](https://foodsilike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/frenchbread2018.dough4_.jpg)\n\nPlace seam side down on a cookie sheet with parchment\n\nDamp cloth on top. I use a blue one, because blue is the best flavor.  Put it in the oven (turned off). Wait like an hour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3: He's heating up! He's on fire! Boom Shakalaka!**\n\nAbout 15 mins before, preheat the oven to 425 (I have convection so you might need to go 450 or so, I don't know, I'm not the bread boss or oven president. 420 would be funnier, and now I'm regretting not trying a 420 blaze it oven. That's probably why I'm not the oven president.\n\nGrab a shank and cut it up a few times like it was talking trash in the yard, but not so deep that it can't join the book club tomorrow.\n\nPut that sucker in the oven when it's ready and bake for like 20 mins. May have to rotate the pan after 10 minutes if the color is looking uneven. I don't know, I'm not a bread whisperer. Do what you want, it's a free country. Unless you're bread, then you have to do as the bread boss dictates.\n\nPull that sucker out after it goes all ding ding.\n\nPlace on a wire rack and let it sit for like 20 minutes. You should probably wait longer, so that's why we make two.\n\nThe ugliest one gets sacrificed first, as is customary.

I used a rough handful of nuts and maybe 3 Tbsp. of sugar.  I pounded this together in a bag with my rolling pin to crush the walnuts fine.

Very happy with it. \n\nIf you have a restaurant supply store nearby, you can usually get 50 lb bags of King Arthur bread flour for $25. Also, no need to buy overpriced, small bottles of \"bread machine\" yeast. Just buy Gold Star or SAF instant - usually 1 lb for $10. Keep it in the freezer. *Some people (including me) find that fleischmann brand yeast, which is commonly sold in grocery stores, has a very chemical taste/smell, not good.\n\nThe recipes that came with your machine are very reliable!", "I love this book.  I find it makes great bread using the dough cycle. Then proof again for about 90 minutes. Bake at 350 for 35 minutes for most loaves. Fairly foolproof.", "I have that machine and love love love it. Be ready to do a smidge of learning; I routinely have to reduce the amount of yeast I add as my loaves were always rising too high and then collapsing. Oh, well\u2026 Don\u2019t set it up right at the edge of your counter as it can shimmy a little while kneading and you don\u2019t want it to go for a nosedive onto the floor. Put it back a good 6-8 inches from the edge. If you\u2019re using whole wheat flour, don\u2019t forget that it will go \u201coff\u201d faster than white flour, so don\u2019t overbuy your whole wheat. The delay start is your friend, you can wake up to the happy fragrance of fresh baking bread. \n\n\u2018Scuse me, I think I\u2019m gonna go set up a loaf for tomorrow\u2019s breakfast now!", "I got mine this week and the only thing I made was cornbread cake bread.", "Initially just follow the recipes in the Zojirushi recipe book.  Haven't had any failures with them.  Once you have made enough (white, whole wheat, european, etc.) and know what things should look like at various stages then start exploring  other recipes, modifications, etc.\n\nIt is an absolutely wonderful machine.  Add the ingredients, set the timer, and you have fresh bread for your breakfast.  Takes maybe 5 minutes to setup.\n\nRight now I am experimenting with the 3 custom settings (at the end of the cycles) trying to make sourdough bread with a starter.", "What recipes do you like so far?", "It\u2019s looks so retro.  Like 70\u2019s", "the plain white bread recipe that is in the included book is great. I put the ingredients in at night and wake up to fresh bread for breakfast and lunch sandwiches", "Your bread machine is a tank, good choice!  The paddles are going to get stuck either in the loaf (for me rarely) or to the posts after baking (almost guaranteed).  This is very normal. Your baking pan has a coating that is NOT indestructible so take care.  A 10 minute soak with hot soapy water is all you need to loosen them. If they are particularly stubborn try spraying with dawn power wash. I\u2019ve started wiping the posts each time I bake with olive oil before placing the paddles and this seems to help.\n\nI had trouble with the written directions for the custom setting.  There\u2019s some excellent video tutorials that make it really easy if you\u2019re a visual learner.\n\nLastly, the Outback bread is excellent and popular here for a reason.  That\u2019s a \u2018wetter\u2019 looking dough so don\u2019t be surprised.  Give it time to come together during the knead cycle before you think about adding any additional flour.", "It's a great machine. Just follow the directions by WEIGHT and in order, and you'll end up with a great loaf of bread. For me , when making wheat bread, I use what they call a dough enhancer. That's just me. Others might disagree", "Don\u2019t put that much butter on your bread."]}

The \"right\" amount of yeast changes by the temperate and humidity of your kitchen, the age of your yeast, the phase of the moon ... (joking).

Wheat bread never rises all that well, so while this has the same volume of flour as the white breads I've previously posted, it just doesn't puff up all that much.  There is a LOT of honey in this recipe.  I converted it to grams because I use the scale to measure things out and it saves so much time vs trying to level the measuring cups.  Everyone knows getting honey out of a measuring cup is an exercise in frustration.\n\nI have a cheap kitchen scale and I don't measure anything larger than a tablespoon by volume anymore.  I'm lazy and its faster.  Tossed the butter into the milk and microwaved it a minute to soften things up.  Pour the milk/butter into the pan and the flour on top in the bread machine and just let it sit 30 minutes to an hour so the flour can hoover up the wetness.  Then dump in all the stuff you measure out with spoons and hit go on the machine.  Anytime I let it sit around a while, like when I use the timer for the morning, I get softer bread.\n\nIt turned out very soft with a nice hint of sweetness from the honey.  I think I'll bump up the white flour to 3.5 cups next time to help fill up the pan.  The malt really does make a difference in the snap of the crust.  Lots of extra room in the machine so next time I think I'm going to chop up some cherries and toss that in.", "This is a beauty!", "Hmm, looks a bit dense for 50% whole wheat.

Pre-operative assessment revealed a non-functional kneading paddle.

Use pumpkin pie spice mix or you can find a recipe online to mix it yourself)\n\n\u00b7 40g (1 \u00bd oz) sugar\n\n\u00b7 110g (4oz) raisins\n\nFor the crosses:\n\n\u00b7 75g (2 \u00bd oz) plain flour\n\n\u00b7 5 tablespoons water\n\nFor the glaze:\n\n\u00b7 4 tablespoon granulated sugar\n\n\u00b7 3 tablespoons of water\n\nPreheat the oven to 425F. Grease a shallow baking dish \u2013 around 14 x 10\u201d (I use the paper from a pack of butter)\n\nBread Machine Recipe\n\nPut the milk, water, beaten egg and melted butter into the bread machine bowl. Add the flour, salt, sugar, yeast and spices. Put it on the dough cycle and add the raisins when it indicates to add \u201cMix Ins\u201d. That should leave you with a dough that is nicely mixed, risen once and knocked down. In our bread machine that is around 95 mins.\n\nRemove the dough from the bread machine and lightly kneed on a floured board.\n\nNon Bread Machine Recipe\n\nTip the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the salt, yeast and mixed spice then give it a good mix.\n\nAdd the sugar and raisins then mix these dry ingredients together and make a well in the centre. Next add the butter and pour the milk and water over the butter followed by the beaten egg.\n\nNow mix everything to a dough, starting with a spatula and finishing with your hands until it is all combined, evenly mixed and leaves the bowl clean. Add a spot more milk if it needs it.\n\nTip on to a lightly floured surface and knead by holding the dough with one hand and stretching it with the heal of the other hand, then folding it back on itself. Repeat for 10 mins until smooth and elastic. Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with oiled cling film and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hr or until doubled in size and a finger pressed into it leaves a dent.\n\nRemove the dough from the bowl and lightly kneed on a floured board.\n\nCut the dough into 12 approximately even sized pieces and lightly roll into balls. Put them into the greased baking dish and leave to rise in a warm place covered with a damp cloth until doubled in size and filling the dish nicely. Around 1 hour.\n\nMeanwhile, make the paste for the crosses. Mix the flour with about 5 tbsp water to make the paste for the cross \u2013 add the water 1 tbsp at a time, so you add just enough for a thick, smooth paste. Spoon into a piping bag with a small nozzle or alternatively use a quart size ziplock bag and cut a very small corner off so you get just the right amount out when you squeeze. Start small with the cut and you can always make it bigger.\n\nWhen the dough has risen take a very sharp knife and make a cross in the top of each bun. Pipe a line along each row of buns, then repeat in the other direction to create crosses.\n\nBake the buns for 20 minutes near the centre of the oven until nicely browned. Then, while they are cooking make the glaze in a small saucepan by slowly melting together the sugar and water over a gentle heat until the sugar granules have dissolved and you have a clear syrup.\n\nAs soon as the buns come out of the oven, brush them immediately with the glaze while they are still warm. Remove from the baking dish and cool on a wire rack.\n\nServe cool sliced in half with English (or Irish Kerrygold) butter!", "[deleted]", "They look fabulous.

The crumb is quite tight (air bubbles are small).

Another possibility is that your yeast is half dead. If that's the case, then try doubling the amount of yeast used.  It's hard for me to tell if you are using not enough water or not enough yeast.

Before you do any of these remember the big rule.  \"Change one thing and only one thing at a time.\"  So as you modify what you've done, take note of the thing you did and take notes on what happened.\n\nCollapsing happens when the fibers of gluten aren't strong enough to hold the bread up.  The fibers are usually stretched out too thin and when half baked become too brittle and cause a collapse from the breaking.\n\nSome things that can cause that.\n\n1. Too much liquid.  Liquid thins out the mixture.  Too much of it thins the mixture out too much causing the thin fibers of gluten.  Remember liquid is any liquid.  Water, oil, and milk.\n2. Too much yeast.  This sounds counter intuitive but remember that those fibers of gluten are stretchy.  Yeast give rise to the dough and once the structure is risen, it's up to those fibers to hold it there.  However, too much yeast will keep stretching those fibers thinner and thinner.\n3. Wrong kind of yeast.  Instant yeast has more action than active dry yeast.  You can't really change the amount of time your bread machine will give you for a particular step in the process, but make sure that you use the correct yeast on the correct cycle (some bread machines allow you to toggle between instant and active).  Otherwise you'll get way too much action and fibers that have been stretched to nothing.\n4. Not enough salt.  Salt acts to retard the yeast action a bit.  Not enough of it and you'll get way too much rising action from the yeast.\n5. Not enough flour. You mentioned this.  Making those elegant fibers of gluten doesn't happen like a structural engineer is working on it.  Those fibers stretch in all kinds of directions.  So you want to make sure that you put enough flour in to ensure that enough of those fibers are there to hold the bread upwards.  Typically add about one to two tablespoons per attempt.  Different flours have different gluten content, so a gluten poor flour will need a little extra help.\n6. Not the right flour.  It happens to us all.  Make sure you are using the type of flour that your recipe calls for.\n7. The yeast is dead.  Check your yeast and also check the temperature of the liquids you put in there.  Yeast becomes active at 90\u00b0F and dies off at 120\u00b0F.  Also yeast has a shelf life, may want to give that a second glace just to be sure.\n\nThose are some suggestions there for you.  Remember to try one change and go from there.  Typically a bread machine has the timing down just fine, so over proofing can be ruled out.  The biggest I've ever run into is the too much liquid.  Remember that flour is a sponge and that it can draw water from the air.  Sometimes it is best to reduce the amount of water going in a little to compensate for that.\n\nI would try in the order I gave as using less means less wasted.  When less isn't working then you try the more.  Also, you don't have to get really crazy here.  Your recipe is more than likely correct so if you've gone 3%\\~5% from the recipe, it best to go back to the original recipe and try a different path.  You shouldn't be doing something like adding a whole cup more flour to your recipe, that's a *bit* too far.  Additionally, it's usually just a single thing that's getting you.  Rarely is it something like add this **AND** minus that.  When it is two things or more things the culprit is usually measuring and not the actual ingredients.\n\nKeep trying though and when you find something that works, make sure you have noted what you did differently.  Getting your first successful loaf is always thrilling, but if in your excitement you forget what you changed, your success will be bittersweet.  Making bread successfully is always a rewarding experience and you can do it!

This is done either by sifting flour, or aerating it by fluffing it up and whisking it well, then spooning it into the measuring cup, then carefully removing any excess flour with a knife. If you just stick that measuring cup in the bag of flour and scoop some out, you will get a lot more flour than what the recipe calls for. Do aerate the flour, or you will end up with dry dough!\n\nHow to make bread in a bread machine:\n\nAdd water and oil into the bread pan. Add salt, sugar. Add flour.\n\nMake a small indentation on top of flour and make sure it does not reach wet ingredients. Add the yeast to the indentation.\n\nKeep yeast away from the salt.\n\nInsert the bread pan into the bread machine, press it down to snap. Close the lid.\n\nUse Basic bread, 1.5 lb loaf, medium crust cycle (3 hrs 15 minutes)\n\nWhen bread is done, remove the bread pan using oven mitts. Turn over the bread pan and shake it to release the loaf. Let the loaf cool on a wire rack for about 30 minutes.", "[deleted]", "Debugging fallen or collapsed bread is difficult. I had my own mishaps, documented here extensively, and found one cause was opening the top of the machine too often. \n\nThe structure in the upper half is all bubbles suggesting, yes, too much carbon dioxide. But these questions are what makes this difficult to debug accurately: where did all that gas come from and when and why didn\u2019t the gluten hold up during the bake? When steam comes into contact with cooler air from ,say, opening the lid and peeking, it condenses and the water drains to the bottom while the pressure in the bubbles drops and they collapse. Too much CO2 over-inflates the gluten net, stretching it beyond its elasticity and the bubbles can collapse. Where did all the gas come from? Too much yeast in the dough  is possible but yeast is self-regulating; regardless of how much yeast is present, once the sugar and the carbohydrates in the flour have been consumed, there is no more yeast activity, just yeast flavor. Yeast activity is modulated or attenuated by the presence salt, temperature, and the quantity and freshness of the bugs.", "Too much water or too much yeast.\n\nIn your recipe it doesn't seem to be the water but I have the impression that's a lot of yeast.

Recipes are based off machine type/ size", "Here's a recipe for Sweet Potato Bread- my adaptation is largely about baking the sweet potato rather than boiling. Baking results in a more reliable water content of the final cooked sweet potato.\n\nSWEET POTATO BREAD - this recipe has been adapted from a book titled \"Bread\nMachine: how to prepare and bake the perfect loaf\" by Jennie Shapter.\nPublished by Anness Publishing LTD 2000 and 2007. I just Googled it and\nthere are several secondhand copies available. There are terrific recipes\nfor making a sourdough-style bread, ciabatta, challah and sweet breads such\nas babka, Chelsea buns. The recipe ingredients are provided in grams, pounds\nand cups.\nhttps://www.ebay.com.au\u00a0 $19.95\nhttps://www.brotherhoodbooks.org.au/ $18\nhttps://www.wob.com/en-au $36\nPrepare the sweet potato\nBuy 2-3 large, evenly-sized sweet potato. Wash the skins and place them on a\nparchment-lined baking tray. Bake at 150degrees C (302F) for about one hour.\nTest for readiness by piecing the thickest bit with a sharp knife. When\nthere is no resistance to knife they are ready. Let cool completely on the\nbench. Put an open ziplock bag on the kitchen scale. Slice open the sweet\npotatoes and scoop out the flesh (don't mash it) and place in the bag. Fill\neach bag to weigh 225g/8 oz/.5lb. Push the air out of the bags, close the\nziplock. Press the bags with the palm of your hand to flatten, so they fit\nin the freezer easily, plus, flat they will defrost faster. Defrost a bag on\na plate in the fridge over night. Take out and place on the kitchen bench\nuntil it comes to room temperature.\nIngredients\n225g/8 oz/.5lb of prepared sweet potato, at room temperature\n210mls/7 1/2fl oz/ scant 1 cup of water. I usually add some hot water to the\ncup, stir it around then tip out the excess. In cold weather tap water is\ntoo cold!\n500g/1lb/4 \u00bd cups of white bread flour with a minimum protein level of 11.5%\nper 100g. I use Caputo Brand- Manitoba Oro Flour that has a protein level of\n14g per 100g. When I use a flour with a lower protein level I add Bread\nImprover, see the end of the ingredients list.\n4.5mls/3 tablespoons of traditional rolled oats ( not quick cooking\nbreakfast oats) In the USA Bob's Red Mill brand calls them Old Fashioned\nRolled Oats. They are called Old Fashioned Oats in the UK eg Quaker Oats\nBrand. In Australia they can be labelled Traditional Rolled Oats, and there\nare various brands, including homebrands.\n30mls/2 tablespoons of full fat Instant milk powder. \n7.5mls/1 \u00bd teaspoons of salt. I use regular iodised salt.\n22mls /1 \u00bd tablespoons of soft brown sugar. Press the sugar in the spoon so\nit is compacted. You can muscovado if you have it but not raw brown sugar-\nit won't dissolve completely.\n40g / 1 1/3 oz / 3 tablespoons of butter - salted or unsalted, whatever you\nhave. It needs to be ointment-soft but not oily. I usually weigh it, then\ncut it into tiny pieces onto a plate, cover it plastic wrap, and let it come\nto room temperature. Then, use an offset spatula/knife and spread it out and\nwork the butter until it has the texture of ointment. Prepare this before\nyou start putting the ingredients in the bread maker basket.\n7.5mls/ 1 1/2teaspoons of Instant Dried Yeast. I use SAF Red Label, Lowan\nWhole Foods label. In the UK it can be called rapid rise yeast and bread\nmachine yeast. In the USA there is Fleischmann's Instant Dry Yeast and Red\nStar Instant Dried Yeast. SAF Red Label is available everywhere. It comes in\na vacuum pack, so you need to have a screw top glass jar to store it in.\n1 heaped teaspoon of Bread Improver.\u00a0 It helps activate the gluten and\nimproves the yeast fermentation process and the overall taste of the bread.\nIt does make a lighter softer loaf, however, the bread will work just fine\nwithout this ingredient. It is usually sold wherever bread-making flour is\nsold.\nMethod\nPour the water into the bread maker's basket. Add the sugar, salt, milk\npowder and rolled oats. Scoop the sweet potato out of the bag and add to the\nbread maker basket.\nWhisk together the flour and bread improver, if using, then place scoops of\nflour over the top of the wet ingredients.\nUse a spatula to lift the creamy butter off the plate and use the tip of a\nknife to pick up dabs of butter and drop/flick! Over the top of the flour.\nSprinkle the yeast, evenly over the flour.\nSet the bread maker to BASIC/Normal setting, medium crust. If your bread\nmaker has a three-level weight setting, select the middle setting. Press the\nNUTS option, not that you are adding nuts, but it is a good opportunity to\ncheck the texture of the dough is just right before the first rising. The\ndough will have a lovely pale apricot colour.\nI usually lift the lid during the first mix to make sure there are no\nunmixed ingredients up the sides on the basket.\nOnce the loaf is baked remove from the basket and let cool completely.\nDepending on your rate of consumption you may want to slice it and place\nslices in ziplock freezer bags (these are more durable than those thin\nfreezer bags. I've been using the same bags for years). Once a bag is empty,\nI shake out the crumbs, let it dry then place in a nook in the freezer ready\nfor the next loaf's slices.", "Pass the karma on\u2026 Give something to someone else.", "Ellen Hoffman has great recipes and is on YouTube to explain how to use the bread machine and many recipes. \nhttp://ellensbreadmachinerecipes.com", "Lucky!

Don't convert volumes from recipes, convert WEIGHTS. You must have a digital scale\n2. It's important to keep your sourdough culture strong. For that you need to discard everyday some starter and add new water and flour (you can keep them in the fridge and add them later to the bread for extra sour).\n3. The ratio for feeding the culture is 1:1 flour/water (weight not volume). This is very very important, because it will allow you to modify your recipes to control the water amount. DO NOT FOLLOW the 2 tbps of flour 1 of water, it's not accurate and you need more accuracy for the bread machine, like once you put all the ingredients in the machine you can't do much.\n4. Feed your culture with flour you are going to use in your bread.\n5. You still need to use fresh flour in the recipe to activate the yeast while it's rising in the bread machine\n6. Feed your culture like 1 to 2 hours before making bread\n\nEDIT: #1 was pretty flat and dense, #2 and #3 came so fluffy. The trick is not to convert volumes and the 1/6 tip I read somewhere. Just use as much starter as possible.\n\nEDIT2: Explained better point 3.", "That is beautiful! How do I make this? We have the same bead machine."]}

Combine all of the dough ingredients in a bowl (or the bucket of your bread machine), and mix and knead \u2014 by hand, using a mixer, or in your bread machine set on the dough cycle \u2014 to make a smooth, very soft dough. The dough should stick a bit to the bottom of the bowl if you're using a stand mixer.\n\nPlace the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise until it's doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, thoroughly drain the tomatoes, patting them dry. Use kitchen shears or a sharp knife to cut them into smaller bits. (Shears are also useful for slicing/chopping the basil.)Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a 22\" x 8 1/2\" rectangle, deflating it slightly. Spread with the cheese, tomatoes, garlic, and basil.\n\nStarting with one long edge, roll the dough into a log the long way. Pinch the edges to seal. Place the log seam-side down on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\nUsing kitchen shears, start 1/2\" from one end and cut the log lengthwise down the center about 1\" deep, to within 1/2\" of the other end.\n\nKeeping the cut side up, form an \"S\" shape. Tuck both ends under the center of the \"S\" to form a \"figure 8;\" pinch the ends together to seal. When shaping the loaf, tuck any larger pieces of tomato or basil down into the dough (to avoid char).\n\nCover and let rise in a warm place until double, 45 to 60 minutes. Want to add flexibility to your schedule? See \"tips,\" below, for details on how to let the dough rise for 8 to 12 hours (or overnight).\n\nWhile the loaf is rising, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\n\nUncover the bread, and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes, tenting it with foil after 20 to 25 minutes to prevent over-browning.\n\nRemove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a rack to cool. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.\n\nStorage instructions: Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days; freeze for longer storage.", "This looks great!", "Very nice and easier to make than it looks, I make a variation with pizza ingredients :)"]}

Measuring flour using cups can lead to very inconsistent amounts and inconsistent results with your bread. You can get digital scales cheaply on Amazon.\n\nYeast is tricky when using a bread maker, since you can't adjust rise time as people do when baking by hand. Since rise time is fixed, you have to adjust the amount of yeast instead. If the top of your loaf is collapsed in or concave, use about half as much yeast, if the top is highly domed and the bread didn't rise enough, try using double the amount of yeast. Hold everything else constant and adjust the amount of yeast until the bread is right.\n\nDuring summer time, to counteract the heat and humidity, use cold water from the fridge and a bit more flour.\n\nAdding an egg (while removing an equal amount of water) will almost always give you a higher lighter loaf.\n\nTry using higher hydration recipes. The nice thing about using a bread maker is that you can go very high hydration (up to 80%) and not have to worry about trying to knead a soggy sticky mess, cause the bread maker does it for you.\n\nInstead of the recipes that came with your bread maker, try the bread recipes at the King Arthur Flour site. Recipes that come with the bread maker (especially the cheaper ones) can be unreliable.\n\nThe order in which you put in the ingredients doesn't really matter. Except for the yeast. Mix your yeast with the flour, or sprinkle it on top of the dough after it's been mixed together. Pouring the yeast directly into the water or on the salt can kill the yeast.\n\nTo make sure that everything is mixed properly, stop the machine after mixing for a minute. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, then start the machine again.\n\nTo get a tastier more interesting loaf, mix all the ingredients (except the yeast) together in the machine, and then start as normal after a couple of hours.", "I may be exhausted, but I saw this and started singing \u201cBaby Shark\u201d. \n\nGreat loaf!

This type of flour is typically low in gluten and is used mainly for pastries that don't rely on rising from yeast, but from baking soda and baking powder (cookies, cakes, etc).\n\nYeast breads need gluten, and if your flour doesn't have enough of it, you can add [Vital Wheat Gluten](https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=20679287&retailer_id=261&region_id=1693055990&utm_medium=sem_shopping&utm_source=instacart_google&utm_campaign=ad_demand_shopping_rp_catchall_california_evergreen&utm_content=accountid-8145171519_campaignid-19755274999_adgroupid-149557268627_device-c&utm_term=targetid-aud-646720837405:pla-1417634651423_locationid-9031984_adtype-pla_productchannel-online_merchantid-260507648_storecode-_productid-20679287&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7aSsBhCiARIsALFvovytz85vZ5Q37GFk5d09q-yROl1WM4u58KR9ctDxm0cDIL4gQ7hu8wIaAkpBEALw_wcB) to get it where it needs to be.  1 Tbs of Vital Wheat Gluten per cup of all purpose flour is a good place to start.  Alternately, if you can find it, just try using [Bread Flour](https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=24060&retailer_id=611&region_id=10078525978&utm_medium=sem_shopping&utm_source=instacart_google&utm_campaign=ad_demand_shopping_rp_catchall_california_evergreen&utm_content=accountid-8145171519_campaignid-19755274999_adgroupid-149557268627_device-c&utm_term=targetid-pla-1417634651423_locationid-9031984_adtype-pla_productchannel-online_merchantid-260615133_storecode-_productid-24060&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7aSsBhCiARIsALFvovwZ7T_-pIzTAbkAyBNN1DS4QjNPDe7HtRHAXaXhyusHKUQtqe1OEBMaAmoyEALw_wcB), sometimes called Premium Baking Flour.  Look for the protein content; it should be above 12.5%\n\nIf you were happy with the recipe before, you could just try less yeast and/or less water, but again, if you could provide your recipe it would be easier to recommend precisely what to try.\n\nMerry Christmas, Happy Holidays, or pick your seasonal reason to celebrate, it's the Winter Solstice!", "How hot is your water/ milk? 110F is ideal blooming temp, 120F they start to die 140F and they\u2019ll die off completely. (These numbers are from memory but I do bake commercially and they\u2019re what I use.)", "I have to worry about my yeast, unsure how good it is as it's old.  So I end up proofing it before adding it to the bread machine.  Unfortunately it means delayed start is not possible.  But that's okay.\n\nI just mix the sugar, about \u00be of the water, and the yeast into a cup and watch it foam.  If it does, I pour the yeast mixture into the bread machine after the flour, using the remaining \u00bc of the water to wash down the sides of the proofing cup, so I don't disturb the mixture percentages.  After knowing for sure the yeast is good, the bread turns out good.", "Yeast tested good, so maybe it\u2019s the flour. \nI\u2019ll try again in a couple days with different flour.", "It looks like your loaf rose evenly and then collapsed. There are several reasons this could happen. \n\nIt would be helpful and easiest to start troubleshooting by testing the yeast vitality using the instructions on the brand\u2019s website (and many other websites). If you get a poor response, a fresher yeast may be the answer here. While the loaf did rise, I am wondering if it rose to where it usually does before collapsing. If it didn\u2019t, needing new yeast is the most likely solution. If it did, time to consider the other ingredients.\n\nIf the splits, fissures, and cracks were in the loaf when you first opened the machine after completion, the dough may have had too weak a gluten structure to contain the yeast\u2019s gas. Because you have used the recipe successfully previously, I would think about when that flour change occurred. If it occurred at the time the disappointing loaves started, then you you might take a look at the protein content. King Arthur writes recipes based on their flours, so you would want to see if your current flour is close to their 11.7% protein level and possibly also compare that to the protein level of the flour used in the successful loaves. If the new flour is close or higher, then the next thing to consider is if your new flour is actually old (check best by date) or could have been stored improperly at the place of purchase. If you have other baked goods turning out well with this flour, then substandard flour is less likely. \n\nWith strong yeast and fresh flour, another thing to look at would be the loaf\u2019s moisture content. Was the loaf gummy or otherwise wetter or denser on the inside? Too much moisture can impede rising in the abbreviated timeframe of bread making in a bread machine. One to two tablespoons less might be helpful with seasonal weather changes or changes in how you new flour absorbs moisture.\n\nYour loaf looks speckled, like possibly you may have added something not in the recipe. If that is pepper, not a problem. If it is seeds, make sure to add those after the add-in beep because you\u2019d want the gluten strands to develop more fully before including ingredients that disrupt that process.", "Weigh your flour using the weight per cup listed on flour company website. Don\u2019t measure it. Weigh as many other ingredients as you can\n\nUse bread flour unless the recipe specifically calls for all purpose. AP flour doesn\u2019t usually work out for bread. \n\nTest your yeast. If in doubt buy a new packet of yeast (instant or \u201cbread machine\u201d yeast) and see if it solves the problem. \n\nMake sure all ingredients are at room temp. Lukewarm milk and water should be about 100F.", "I had this happen the first time I made bread. After that I 1) switched from all purpose flour to bread flour and 2) bought new yeast in case it was a bad batch and it hasn't happened again so I'd be willing to bet one of those are your issues. I pretty much always use bread flour now even when recipes say you can use all purpose and it seems to work much better. The change in flour brand might have something to do with it.", "Temperature of the room will change dough raising amount. Based on your image the dough rose to max amount and collapsed.", "I'd check the yeast - are you using instant or active dry?  And is it fresh?  Has it been stored at least int he refrigerator?  \n\n\nWhen switching the type of flour, each requires a little different amount of water, too.  \n\n\nElsewhere it was mentioned you might not have enough gluten in the flour - what were you using and did it rate the protein percentage?", "Using Anita\u2019s stone ground whole wheat gave me a denser loaf than the Rogers whole wheat .

The recipes off their website are so easy to follow and fun and very Japanese. \n\nThe Zoji is a little small, I was very very lucky to find it here in Aus. I did some research and a larger model that is pretty good that I could reasonably find on Marketplace secondhand was a Panasonic SD2501, and again I found a cheapy and have cleaned it up and have tried a few larger loaves. \n\nMy loaves have been ok, look good visually, taste ok but not knocking my socks off.

It seems to taste better and certainly has a better mouth feel. I'd also done a coconut milk wash on the top which was nice, didn't brown the top much but tasty.\n\nIf you haven't had Pandan before it's a vanilla creamy coconutty flavour that's popular through Asia. I'd had it in several different treats in Thailand many years ago. I used the McCormicks Pandan Extract. You can find them in Asian Grocers or pick them up online. They come in either green or clear. \n\nI'm very happy and feel this has greatly improved my bread making.

It was too wet, was my conclusion, and I failed to intervene with more flour while I had the chance because I didn't recognize the problem.  \n\nWhile I was there, I asked ChatGPT to spell out a likely procedure for making a marble rye in the machine, which amounted to making 2x 1-lb doughs that are the same except for one having some cocoa and/or coffee for color.  \n\nRecipe follows: \nLight Rye Dough (by weight):  \n\t\u2022\tWater: 240 g (1 cup)  \n\t\u2022\tSalt: 1 \u00bd tsp (~9 g)  \n\t\u2022\tMolasses or honey: 1 \u00bd tbsp (~30 g)  \n\t\u2022\tBread flour: 240 g (2 cups)  \n\t\u2022\tRye flour: 90 g (\u00be cup)  \n\t\u2022\tCaraway seeds (optional): 1 \u00bd tsp (~3 g)  \n\t\u2022\tYeast (active dry or instant): 1 \u00bd tsp (~5 g)  \n\nDark Rye Dough: Same as above, plus these mix-ins to be added after the flours:    \n\t\u2022\tCocoa powder: 1 \u00bd tbsp (~7 g)  \n\t\u2022\tInstant coffee (optional): 1 tsp (~2 g)  \n\nI used the caraway seeds and, in the latter loaf, both cocoa powder and about 3/4 tsp of instant espresso.  \n\nSteps:\n\n1.\tPrepare the Doughs:  \n\u2022\tUse your bread machine\u2019s dough cycle to make each dough separately. Start with the light rye dough, and when that\u2019s done, repeat the process with the dark rye dough.  \n2.\tShape the Doughs:  \n\u2022\tOnce both doughs are ready, remove them from the machine and place them on a floured surface.  \n\u2022\tRoll each dough into rectangles of similar size.  \n3.\tCreate the Swirl:  \n\u2022\tPlace the dark dough rectangle on top of the light dough rectangle (or vice versa).  \n\u2022\tRoll them up tightly, jelly-roll style, to form a loaf. For a more intricate marble effect, you can cut the doughs into smaller pieces and layer them randomly before rolling.  \n4.\tSecond Rise:  \n\u2022\tPlace the rolled loaf into the bread machine pan or a loaf pan, depending on your preference.  \n\u2022\tAllow the dough to rise for 30-45 minutes until it doubles in size. If your bread machine has a bake-only mode, use that for the final rise.  \n5.\tBake:  \n\u2022\tUse the bake-only setting on your bread machine to bake the loaf. Typically, this will take 40-50 minutes at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). (Remove the paddle!)  \n\u2022\tIf baking in an oven, preheat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and bake for 30-35 minutes.  \n6.\tCool and Enjoy:  \n\u2022\tLet the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing.  \n\nMy Notes: Used the dough-only cycle for both halves, and let them rise in the fridge (for timing reasons; countertop rise would've been fine).   \nAfter combining the doughs, I did the bench proofing step in the oven, which I warmed up to ~75F using the heating element, because it was chilly in there, and then left the oven light on.  Worked great, but took a couple hours; this dough was always slow to rise.  \nI baked it for about 50 minutes, checking for internal temp around 205F, using the bake-only cycle on my bread machine.  If anyone cares, it's a Cuisinart CBK-200.", "Looks really cool!", "Wow!!! This looks so beautiful.", "You did so well! So pretty! Thank you so much for showing this off!", "***BEAUTIFUL***"]}

The instructions on the breadmaker machine wanted the volcano pocket on top of the flour method, and was keen to not let the yeast touch liquids (the machine instantly starts mixing once I hit \"go\", so I'm not sure I follow their logic).  The yeast however wanted me to premix with half the flour and all the liquids already inside the machine.  After some re-reading, I noticed a second option on the yeast instructions to pre-mix the packet with 1/4 cup of water and let sit until volume doubled.  I went with that method.  But spooning out 2.5 teaspoons of this water-yeast mix seems like it's going to give me a lot less yeast than I would have gotten if I had used 2.5 teaspoons of the dry mix out of the packet.

I wanted to get a second pan so I could have it ready to go right after a loaf came out without needing to clean the pan, but seeing them online for 3x what I paid for the machine, plus shipping, was disheartening.  I stuck to religiously cleaning the pan after each loaf, but, apparently, committed a cardinal sin of bread machines while doing so - I washed the bottom of the pan.  Each and every time.\n\nAfter about 20 loaves, the posts started to stick up.  I applied some 3-in-1 oil (as recommended by Bread Machine Digest) to the posts, and while it did free them up for 2-3 loaves, it's now worse than it was in the beginning, and I feared it'd tear the belt out of my machine.  I tried to take the pan apart as much as I could, but could only really get the \"wingnut\" things and washers off the bottom of the posts.  It was clear that something wasn't lubricated because of a metallic-y paste below the washers.  I applied some more 3-in-1 oil to the posts, and while they've freed up some, I fear I may have killed the pan.\n\nSo, I decided to go hunting for another machine, preferably another twin post/3.0lb machine because I like how well they mix the ingredients and the size of the loaves.  Saw the B&D B2300 at Talize, saw that it was missing a paddle, but knew I could probably get the price down because of that.  Paid $9.99 for it after the manager took a look and gave it a price.  Sad thing is, the paddles seem to be proprietary, as it's not the standard \"D\" shaft, but instead has keyholes on both sides, and the B6000C paddles won't fit in that machine.\n\nWent to Value Village next, and apparently I should've gone there first, as there was the B6000C right on the shelf.  Picked it up, along with a couple of Nerf blasters, and was out the door.\n\nNow to figure out if I can ever salvage the first pan...", "Is it a good machine?

{"title": "Best Bread Machine Tips I Ever Got From People", "selftext": "After many times trying with my Cuisinart bread maker and getting inconsistent results for ages- I got a couple great tips from the community and people that have made all the difference. \n\n1.  Measure by WEIGHT not cups/oz etc.   Investing in a good baker/kitchen scale was a game changer.    In my recipe books I\u2019ve now scribbled weight in grams near every recipe.   It\u2019s going to vary by flour type, etc but I now have pinpoint measurements that give me the same result on the same type of bread with the same type of flour each time.   \n\n2.  Refrigerate yeast.   My mother never did.  My grandmother never did.   My mother still doesn\u2019t but she adds a lot more to her bread than I do.   Keep your yeast in the refrigerator between baking sessions.   Dead yeast sucks. \n\n3.  \u201cFleishman\u2019s Bread Booster\u201d - this product may be a regional thing to Canada but, in essence, it\u2019s vital wheat gluten and ascorbic acid powder.    I don\u2019t use as much as it says but the tiny addition of ascorbic acid makes all the difference in letting your bread be mold free much longer if you\u2019re not someone who is going to eat it all fast.    You can also crush up an unflavoured vitamin C (ascorbic acid) pill to add to your bread if desired.  \n\n4.  Bread flour.   Look for BREAD FLOUR on your flour you buy.   It makes a huge difference in the machines.  \n\n5.  Integral whole wheat bread flour seems to give a better taste and texture than whole wheat bread flour.    Integral includes all of the wheat, whole wheat has a part removed.   I\u2019ve found the integral wheat bread is much more delightful texture wise.  \n\n6. Never give up.   Baking is really a science.  Don\u2019t be afraid to tweak.  Keep notes and once you got a plan that makes perfect results for your machine in your climate with your preferred flour, etc- you\u2019ve cracked the code.    I\u2019ve eaten every mistake I made (provided it was thoroughly cooked) so I know what bad results taste like.  \n\nEDIT: Lots of great additional tips in the comments below from other Redditors.  \ud83d\udc4d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadMachines/comments/1cebogh/best_bread_machine_tips_i_ever_got_from_people/", "created_utc": 1714214901.0, "score": 50, "author": "Mikeyboy2188", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/BreadMachines/comments/1cebogh/best_bread_machine_tips_i_ever_got_from_people/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Here\u2019s mine - use bread dad", "100% agree, especially with the first tip. \n\nOne more tip: all the bread machines (types, brands) do the exact same thing.

{"title": "Banana Bread - Kitchen in Box Machine", "selftext": "Since my last post, I've made white bread and sweet bread using the manual's recipe. They came out fine, not mind blowing. My kid especially loves the white bread for PB&Js.  \n\nWe had 2 large bananas that were brown, partner suggested we try a banana bread.  \n\nI decided to follow this **recipe from Bread Dad** because it was the first one that came up on Google and I vaguely recalled this sub saying Bread Dad was great.  \n\nhttps://breaddad.com/bread-machine-banana-bread/. \n\nI'm running **\"cake\" setting, 2 lb loaf, medium color**.   \n\nThe total time (1h 33m) is a little under what the recipe calls for but I don't know what to do about that.  \n\n\n\n**Some changes of note -**  \n\nOnly had 2 bananas, which after being mashed came out to about 210 grams. I made up the remaining 20 grams with **apple/pear/carrot puree** from a snack pouch I had in the refrigerator.  \n\n8 tablespoons aka 1 whole stick of softened butter came out to be about 112 grams not 115 grams, but I didn't open another stick of butter to top it off.  \n\nI used **Kerrygold salted butter**, not unsalted butter.  \n\n2 eggs came out to about 109 grams, not 114 grams but I didn't do anything to make up the remainder of the weight.  \n\nI used **dark brown sugar** rather than light brown sugar and went by weight, not volume. The sugar was ROCK HARD in its glass jar and I had to scrape it loose with a spoon and break up chunks with my hands. After getting what I needed for the recipe, I tossed the rest of it because I was so mad.   \n\nI used \"Jacobsen Pure Italian **Fine Sea Salt**\".    \n\nI chopped slightly under 1/2 cup of **unsalted unroasted pecans**. Tossed it with a bit of flour.   \n\nHovered by the machine because I wasn't sure how to tell when \"mix 1\" is over and \"mix 2\" has started. With **about 1h 9m left in the timer**, the stirring sounds stopped so I RAN to put in the chopped nuts.   \n\nDuring mix 1 I'm noticing a decent amount of **butter stuck to the side of the pan** and not getting incorporated in. After mix 1 stopped, I scraped the side and tried to incorporate that butter in.  \n\nIn the process of mixing in the butter, the nuts got mixed in rather than sitting at the top, I hope this doesn't come back to bite me in the butt.  \n\nThis damn machine's screen not lighting up/showing the stage it's on while running continues to be the bane of my existence. If you shine a little flashlight at the screen, you can make out the time remaining, but it is SO HARD to see what stage it's currently on. This is the only reason I would recommend against getting this machine.   \n\nRealized after about 10 minutes that **there IS no mix 2**, there's just mix 1 and now it's baking. Uhh, not sure how that's going to pan out with the nuts and the butter that I scraped. WTF. I don't want to lose heat by opening the machine again, so I'm just going to let it ride.  \n\n**Side note:** why does this Bread Dad recipe repeat itself so much? The notes section after the actual recipe has notes that are important but they seem to repeat in chunks? I'm not sure.  \n\nWhen the Cake cycle finished, did the toothpick test with a chopstick in the center. Came out completely raw and sticky! Set it to **mode 14 (bake) for 15 minutes.**  \n\nStill was wet after 15 min!! Did **mode 14 (bake) again for 20 min**. Then it finally passed the toothpick test, so I took it out of the pan and put it on a rack to cool.   \n\nI let it cool for an hour and then cut into it and **OH MY GOD it tastes so good!** Strong banana flavor, sweet without overwhelming, moist but not gummy.   \n\nI'm not even a big fan of banana bread but this is very delicious.

I\u2019m still working on the shaping, but it\u2019s getting better with practice.", "An hour feels too long to me for the last rise after shaping - when I do tray bakes for hoagie buns and such, I do a dough cycle, shape, and then give them 35 mins after shaping in a warm spot by the preheating oven, and they puff up perfect and uniform every time.", "That last spin is the \u201cpunch down\u201d. I\u2019ve seen people do a punch down even when making bread by hand. Wonder if this machine (I have the same) is too strong on the punch down. Anyway, you\u2019re supposed to shape after that and let it rise again (less than double the size) then bake. Not sure why you\u2019re not getting a small rise after punch down-shape-rest. Maybe next time you should remove it before the punch down and shape it for bake.", "I want to preface this by saying that none of this is a moral judgement on you and that I used to not know any of this either. I'm just autistic and over explaining is the only kind of explaining that I know how to do.            \n\n- **Shaping is probably a good 75% of your problem.**\n\n- **Related to but separate from shaping, your scoring is hurting them too.** I don't know what you're currently using to score the loaves, but you're cutting waaaaay too deep and either too early into the final rise (it should be done only seconds before going into the oven; if you're using an egg wash, score after brushing it on) or too late (as in you're overproofing).\n\n- **I think you're over-proofing/over-fermenting.** All those air pockets over-inflate and can no longer support themselves, causing collapse. Not only does this happen from  proofing for too long but also from too warm or using too much yeast. This can happen during both the bulk fermentation (pre-shape rise) and the post-shape rise. In addition to collapse, letting the yeast over-ferment can eat away at too many of certain starches in the dough that would normally \n\n- **Is your oven hot enough?** French bread usually bakes at a minimum of 400\u00b0F/205\u00b0C but yours seems awfully pale. Could be from over-fermentation, but could also be from an oven that's not hot enough. French bread should still brown nicely without an egg wash. (Btw, if you are going to do an egg wash, make sure you add a bit of water to thin it out. For French bread, I actually prefer to add the yolk to my dough and use just the white for the wash.)\n\n- **If your recipe makes a very loose, slack dough instead of a soft and pillowy one, then you might just not have the right gear.** Baguettes and french bread are two totally different breads and doughs but you're using the terms interchangeably. Baguettes come from a looser, stickier dough with a sparse ingredient list (usually with an overnight pre-ferment), uses some specialized equipment (baker's cloth for shaping, a molded pan for baking), should yield a wide open crumb and crackly, crisp crust. French bread comes from a pillowy dough (often including dairy) that can support its own weight, can be made on a regular baking sheet, and yields a finer crumb with a smooth crust. In everyday life the distinction doesn't necessarily matter, but when you're looking for baking advice it does.              \n\nAgain, none of this was meant to be judging or scolding you, I just want to be as thoroughly helpful as possible."]}

Something like [this](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/314639201389?_ul=GB&rb_itemId=314639201389&rb_pgeo=GB&ff=11&mkevt=1&mkcid=1&mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&campid=5339059258&toolid=10044&customid=EAIaIQobChMIlefx9LDijAMV06JQBh1CCwixEAQYCiABEgJghfD_BwE&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADA7Q_KEjSR_jWdP5YiUNHlBsToVB&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlefx9LDijAMV06JQBh1CCwixEAQYCiABEgJghfD_BwE) \n. Because some size recipes call for three quarters of a teaspoon of yeast\u2026. And it really means it. Too much or too little and the loaf will be bad. \n\nSame with measuring the liquid. 10ml of liquid too much, or too little, and the loaf will be bad. \n\nMy advice for bread makers is : Get your weights and measures correct and you\u2019ll get good results."]}

Back when I got my Panasonic Bread Bakery 20 something years ago I checked out every bread machine book I could find through my library and found that most of the recipes in the fru fru frilly books failed for me. \n\nCheck your owners manual. If it says you need to bring your ingredients to room temp before putting them in the pan, you probably don't have a preheat cycle on your machine. Make sure you bring your ingredients to room temp!\n\nAlso check the manual to see if your machine has a preferred way of adding ingredients.\n\nMost recipes use either Basic/Standard or Whole Wheat settings.

Generally, I put the yeast in with the rest of those.  I always put the liquid in the bread pan first, then dump the dry mix on top or it.  If you're setting up your bread machine to sit on Delay and bake later, then you should do as instructions say and make a well and put the yeast in it so it doesn't get wet.  If you're going to mix and bake right away, you can mix everything together at once. \n\n( The liquid goes in first so that the paddle isn't trying to push a mound of dry flour when the machine starts up.)\n\nI don't always weigh ingredients. I make sure I don't pack flour into the measuring cup because that will cause the biggest error.   Humidity in houses and flour can vary widely with weather, and source of heating. Forced air gas dries my house air out in winter, but i have high humidity in summer since I have no air conditioner.  All purpose flour seems to be thirstier than bread flours lately.  Always check your dough during the first knead and adjust the humidity in in , as required.

I freeze it after cutting and toast to order. \n\nI just put the ingredients in the correct order: \u2014wet, \n\u2014dry (I pre mix the dry ingredients to help it), \n\u2014yeast. \n\nWhen it beeps to remind you to scrape, I make sure to do it so I don\u2019t get a \u201ccollar\u201d of unmixed flour after it\u2019s baked. I also turn it out as soon as it\u2019s done so it doesn\u2019t get tough and I turn it on a rack and on its side to cool completely before cutting.  Apparently side cooling helps the top not cave, and cooling completely before cutting (I\u2019m talking completely room temp) helps it not get gummy. I think it still needs the residual heat to finish. \n\nThey have a few flour mixes they used for testing but I use the Bob\u2019s Red Mill Gluten Free flour mix (red label) that\u2019s made with garbanzo, and the psyllium husk they recommend in the book (I forget the brand) because psyllium naturally has  anthocyanins which turns the bread purple. But the one they recommend does not. Maybe your kids would like purple bread though! Psyllium gives it the \u201cspringy\u201d texture that is more like regular bread. \n\nI use either the medium or light crust setting. Light crust setting makes a more crumbly top that is noticeable when cutting, medium crust cuts like regular bread. \n\nIn other news, we also make their Gluten Free pizza dough that\u2019s in the book and it comes out great (but thick like Detroit pizza). I use the sourdough setting. I was doing it in the stand mixer but the zoji was easier. I wfh so I just measure out the ingredients and add\u2014it takes 10 minutes of effort instead of standing over it. We use 2 of the  1/4 sheet pans and line with parchment and get 2 pizzas.  I oil an offset spatula to spread it in the pans because it\u2019s pretty sticky. Follow their directions to cook, flip halfway.\n\nWith ATK recipes: \n\nYou have to weigh all ingredients and also follow their directions exactly down to the brands of flour etc, because those are the ones they used to test the recipes. If not, the recipes might not turn out well. \n\nThe book is \u201cHow It Can Be Gluten Free\u201d\n\nOne thing to note (sorry if you already know this) is that Gluten Free \u201cdoughs\u201d are more like batter and they just aren\u2019t the same as regular dough at all. It\u2019s sort of like a thick cake or brownie batter consistency. \n\n\nThat\u2019s what works for me and while it\u2019s not like regular bread, it tastes (AND smells) great! I eat great sandwiches and toast now. We love our Friday pizza night. I have their app and make a lot of delicious things. If it\u2019s not Gluten Free I sub things (such as Gluten Free lasagna noodles for their \u201ccheese and tomato lasagna\u201d, or this sandwich bread above for their \u201creally good garlic bread\u201d which makes a killer dinner. \n\nHighly highly recommend!", "I would recommend checking out King Arthur Flour.

If there is indeed a great gluten-free bread, machine recipe, I would love to know. In the meantime, I can tell you that I have found a fantastic gluten-free bread recipe that is not a bread machine recipe- its the Snow White Bakes Gluten Free sandwich bread, using her custom flour blend. I quadruple the flour blend recipe so I don\u2019t have to make it that often, and then I double the bread recipe and put one loaf in the freezer, so I only have to bake the GF bread one or two times per month.

Pretzel dough is low hydration (about 55%) which is quite stiff and may be difficult to handle for a bread machine. You can probably go up to 60% to make it work. It's a basic flour/water/salt/yeast dough, except you add about 10% butter.\n\nThe thing that turns ordinary dough into a pretzel is to submerge it in a 4% lye (sodium hydroxide) solution. E.g. 40g sodium hydroxide for 1 liter of water. This stuff is not totally harmless; it will stain clothing and wood (countertop, cutting board) instantly. It also reacts with aluminum, so it's best to cover the cookie sheet that you use to bake the pretzels with a silicone mat. Sodium hydroxide will also burn holes into parchment paper, so if you go that route, use 2 layers. You don't boil pretzels in lye (like bagels), but it's enough to just submerge them in room-temperature lye solution for about 10-20 seconds. Wear vinyl or nitrile gloves, and safety glasses. The pretzels will invariable drip as you take them out of the lye onto the cookie sheet, so plan ahead and arrange things so you don't ruin something by dripping.\n\nHere's the dough recipe that I use (not specific for bread machine):\n\n500g bread flour  \n275g water (that's 55% hydration; go up to 300g if necessary)  \n20g butter  \n10g salt  \n10g sugar  \n5g instant yeast\n\nThat's a bit over 1.5 pounds of dough, so you might need a 2-pound machine, or scale it down to 400g flour, 220g water, 16g butter, 8g salt, 8g sugar, 4g yeast\n\n\\* Divide dough into 80g portions (about 10 pretzels in the full recipe) and shape into pretzels\n\n\\* Proof for 1 hour (not covered)\n\n\\* Dip in 4% lye solution for 10-20 seconds, then sprinkle with coarse salt\n\n\\* bake 18 minutes at 410F (no steam)\n\nThe original recipe has 11-14 minutes of kneading, and just a 15 minute rest before dividing and shaping. If you're doing this in the dough cycle, that includes 1 or 2 proofing cycles, which this recipe doesn't want, so you may want to cut it short.

(Nutritional yeasts, such as brewer\u2019s and torula, are not leavening agents.) Fast-acting yeast and bread machine yeast both work well in the bread machine; quick-rise yeast can also be used.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most readily available fast-acting or instant yeast comes from Lesaffre (a French company operating in Belgium and elsewhere), which has been producing commercial yeast since Louis Pasteur figured out how to isolate and cultivate single strains. This yeast, labeled \u201cSAF-Instant Red\u201d yeast, is very popular among bread machine bakers. My testers and I nicknamed it the \u201cindustrial-strength yeast\u201d for its incredible and reliable rising power. Composed of a different strain of yeast than our domestic brands, SAF yeast is dried to a very low percentage of moisture and coated with ascorbic acid and a form of sugar, enabling it to activate immediately on contact with warm liquid. This type of yeast needs no initial dissolving in liquid, which makes it perfect for the bread machine. It has free-flowing rod-shaped granules that were developed with easy measuring in mind. SAF yeast contains three times as many yeast cells per volume as other\u201d\n\n\u201cgranular yeasts, so the amount used in a recipe should be cut back by about 25 percent from the amount of yeast called for.\u201d\n\nSmall excerpt From the yeast section in\n\nThe Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook, Newly Expanded and Updated\n\nBeth Hensperger\n\n[https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-bread-lovers-bread-machine-cookbook-newly/id6477619212](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-bread-lovers-bread-machine-cookbook-newly/id6477619212)\n\nThis material may be protected by copyright.", "I like the SAF instant yeast.

It might have been on an \"old recipes\" Facebook that I belong to.  Or it might have been here.  It's a good basic plain sandwich bread recipe to riff off of.  I always adjust the stickiness of the dough in the first part of the bread machine cycle, so I don't worry about absolute precision if I'm in a hurry.  I just measure everything out.   I've made this recipe various ways:\n\n1. 50/50 KA white bread flour and KA whole wheat bread flour, with and without the added vital wheat gluten. Gluten makes a difference and helps it be a fluffier loaf.  The mixed flours creates a lighter brown bread.  We like it.\n2. All white bread flour, with and without without the added gluten.  I increased the yeast a bit when I didn't have any wheat gluten.  I really didn't notice much difference between wheat gluten or none.  The KA white bread flour didn't really seem to need it.  Some store brands bread flours are lower protein, and they might benefit more from it.\n3. Today, I made it using Gold Medal unbleached all purpose flour and 2tbsp vital wheat gluten and 2 tsp of SAF red yeast, remainder of recipe as-written.    I didn't weigh anything, I measured.\n\nThe humidity of the loaf is affected by the flour(s) used and whether or not gluten is added. The first loaf I made with the 50/50 flours, no vital wheat gluten added, was downright soupy and I had to add flour.    The second 50/50 included wheat gluten and was just a tad dry so I added about 1 tbsp of water.   Today's Gold Medal unbleached AP flour is \\*the thirstiest flour, ever\\*, bone-dry, and I had to add lots of water, like 1/2 to 3/4 cup!  I've needed to add a lotta watta to the bread every time I used that Gold Medal.   It's even worse when combined with wheat gluten. It baked acceptably, but a bit lopsided because I wasn't available to lift and reposition the loaf.  So it baked crooked, but it still tastes great and is soft.   (Only a 1# loaf in a 2# machine, so there's extra space for it to slide off-center in the bread pan.)\n\nAlso today, I mixed a no-knead \"artisan\" loaf with that Gold Medal unbleached AP flour.  It sits 12-18 hours at room temperature.  It is supposed to be a \"shaggy\" loaf per the instructions, but instead, it was bone-dry and totally crumbly and I had to add almost 1 cup of liquid to it to get it as soupy as it is when I make the same recipe with KA bread flour.   I'm trying to use up this Gold Medal and get rid of it.  I'm shocked at just how much extra water I need to add to the stuff, and even more shocked that I still got real nice loaves out of it.    hee hee", "Thank you so much for this write up.

I baked the dough in the 1-pound Pullman Pan and it didn't even touch the top of the pan, let alone fill it.

The bread itself was fine - I wish it was fluffier but I think it's close to what it's supposed to be like. Here are my questions:\n\n1. Do I simply need more dough? \n2. The Zojirushi machine is called a \"1-pound loaf machine\", can I just put in 1.5 times the ingredients for a 1.5lb dough?\n3. If I can't use the machine to make a 1.5lb dough, can I make a 1lb dough twice, then combine two doughs?

The combination of salted butter and extra salt could have put the yeast to sleep\u2014it\u2019s a delicate balance, and too much salt can slow it down, or even halt it completely. The buttermilk\u2019s acidity can also play a part in that\u2014while it can bring some lovely flavor, it needs to be used gently so it doesn\u2019t disrupt the rise.\n\nIf you're unsure about the yeast, here\u2019s a little trick: dissolve the yeast in some warm water with a pinch of sugar and let it rest for 10 minutes. If it\u2019s still good, you\u2019ll see it bubble up like a little magic show, giving you the confidence to keep going. If it stays flat, well, it might be time to swap it out.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind\u2014yeast and salt don\u2019t always get along. To help your dough rise in harmony, try keeping them separate. You can either dissolve the salt in the water before adding the flour, and then sprinkle the yeast on top of the flour, or activate the yeast first by mixing it with warm water and a little sugar, then add the salt to the flour. Giving the yeast a chance to wake up before the salt gets involved can make a world of difference.\n\nIf you're just starting out, I'd recommend sticking with a simple recipe to get your rhythm. Something like 1 cup of water, 3 cups of flour, and a dose of yeast. Nothing too complicated. The beauty of baking is in the basics\u2014once you get that down, feel free to experiment, but the foundation always makes for a solid loaf."]}

The recipe said to double the sugar and I said heck no. I think grapes and raspberry probably doesn't need much sugar at all since they're already so dang sweet. My supermarket blueberries were really watery and flavorless but in the jam they were super strong and tangy.\n\nAnyways with grapes or raspberries you might wanna process them first, depends on the texture you want, right? Like peeling the skins and pushing them through a strainer to get the seeds or skins off. Then again the texture can be good too and the skins from the grape makes the color vibrant. \n\nI think grape jam would be super runny and need pectin for sure. You can probably make raspberry without it though, it will just be more runny and less like a jelly consistency", "I used to make wonderful fresh strawberry jam in my old Oster. It used coarsely chopped strawberries, sugar, and pectin. It took 2 one hour jam cycles. It must be kept in the refrigerator and is somewhat perishable. \n\nFrozen fruit also works well and has a more traditional jam rather than fresh fruit flavor. It will be less perishable. \n\nUnfortunately, my Panasonic doesn\u2019t have a jam cycle. I make marmalade and jam in my Instant Pot now."]}

{"title": "What makes a bread more fluffy/less dense?", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm relatively new to using a BBM (and to this sub for that matter). I bought myself a Panasonic SD-B2510WXE for Christmas and have been making loafs in it since then.\n\nAt first I've experimented a lot and finally 'settled' for an easy daily recipe based (in order of putting it in the bread pan):\n\n* 360ml water\n* 9gr. salt\n* 3 tbsp. (rice) oil (the oil I use most and always have at home)\n* 325gr. bread flour\n* 175gr. whole wheat flour\n* 5gr. instant yeast\n\nThe amount of water I had to increase quite a bit as the recipe I found only used 270ml water. The dough was quite lumpy and the loaf looked a bit like a rocky landscape so I started to increase the water.\n\nThe taste of this bread was quite good, but it was rather dense. Initially I baked the bread on the Basic program (program 1), later I switch to the whole wheat program to give it more time to rise. But the bread was still rather dense and it would dry out quickly. It would barely reach half of the height of the bread pan. This photo shows a picture of one of the last loafs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kl5ifkkthie1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7197b24ca50415dca5928db7b1da48d20abd14e\n\nSo I tried something completely different, the [whole wheat bread](https://breaddad.com/whole-wheat-bread-machine-recipe/) from Bread Dad. I made the 2lb version as it used approx. the same amount of flower as my old recipe, which is big enough for my family for a day. But other than that the recipe is quite different. It uses milk instead of water, butter instead of oil and it adds sugar.\n\nNow, you must know that a typical bread in my country (The Netherlands) doesn't taste sweet. So I used less sugar in my loaf, as the author suggested. But other than that I sticked to the recipe.\n\nThe difference was huge! This loaf came out big, soft and fluffy, as you can see in the next photos. This loaf was almost spilling over the bread pan. Still tasted a bit sweet to my liking, but that can be adjusted.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cx369z5othie1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=905eb154c9522f2728ccd4858a04cc08531095c1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w78boz5othie1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1390098489ca54960a5e44e4e59c8b1f567c9c98\n\nBut this difference does make me wonder, what ingredient(s) makes this recipe so much more fluffy than my own recipe?

When the dough is mixing a small amount of dough gets into this square.  Once the bread goes through the baking process it bakes a small amount of dough in this small square gap.  The reason why this is smart is that when you tip your pan up-side-down to take your finished bread out of the pan, it keeps the paddles inside of the pan rather than stuck in the bread.  Once your pan has cooled a little put enough water in the pan to cover the paddles and let it sit for 5 minutes.

Usually, I take the 2lb recipe and half the ingredients to get the amount for a 1lb loaf, but both the 1.5 and 2 lb use the same 6 oz of juice so the lack of scaling is throwing me off. If they used the same amount in both recipes can I also? Or should I still halve it to 3 oz or maybe 4oz? Curious how others would approach this. Thanks!\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nAfter the conversion math, I do believe it's in fact a typo, and the 2 lb recipe should read 8 oz of juice, as that makes all the math for both recipes and conversions accurate.\n\nRESULTS UPDATE\n\nBread came out perfectly! 4 oz of the pineapple juice was the right amount for a 1 lb loaf of bread.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadMachines/comments/1icyjgf/help_with_scaling_down_aloha_pineapple_bread/", "created_utc": 1738169952.0, "score": 2, "author": "CorgiCraZ", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/BreadMachines/comments/1icyjgf/help_with_scaling_down_aloha_pineapple_bread/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Pineapple juice is sold in 6 ounce cans so they are probably just trying to keep it simple.

I think the problem for me was that I didn't work the dough ball enough on my counter with my bench scraper to smooth the dough and build tension in the dough ball. Tensioning the dough allows the carbon dioxide generated by the yeast to start inflating the dough. I also didn't rest the dough for 30 minutes before shaping it for the bread pan and the final rise before baking. \n\nMy bread hardly rose in the oven but it still had a fair amount of bubbles. Also, always let your bread cool for at least 3 hours before cutting into it or the bread may be gummy inside."]}

{"title": "Zojirushi BB-SSC10 review", "selftext": "Tough to find reviews online for this model as it\u2019s the newest machine in the Zojirushi lineup. I had an old BBCC-S15 I got from Goodwill that was probably pushing 30 years old that I was struggling to get good results with, so I took the plunge and found an open box one used only once on EBay for $220. They\u2019re usually around $375 so that was a big enough discount. My wife and I wanted this one because it\u2019s just us, and the larger 1.5lb or 2lb loaves other machines make always left us two days later throwing away a quarter of it. As you see from the photos this makes perfect little loaves for two people to enjoy.\n\nThis is an awesome machine! Definitely feels premium and has premium features. 14 different presets and extensive custom options. The pan is light, durable, and easy to get the loaf out of. It\u2019s a little louder than I thought a top of the line model in 2018 would be, but it\u2019s definitely quieter than the old one and still probably much quieter than most. It bakes very evenly, and the nut dispenser is heavy duty and works great. You get a real nice swirl with the raisins in the bread shown above. \n\nThe photo of the white bread is their basic white from the recipe book, and while it\u2019s good, the French bread this thing makes is the best bread I\u2019ve ever eaten from a machine like this.

{"title": "Bread Hack Requests", "selftext": "Hi there, big fan of the mods in this subreddit as well as all the contributions made by the users.\n\nI have been enjoying using my thrifted bread machine <$20 of course with various recipes including the ones recommended here by Bread Dad.\n\nNow that my family is regularly consuming home made bread I would like to ask for some hacks to make things easier for me. \n\nFor example 1. is it possible to premeasure all the dry ingredients ahead of time? From my understanding I would need to keep the yeast separate until I am ready to mix so that the salt does not kill it? Whats the best way to store in advance (glass containers, ziplock bags etc)\n\nI am finding those grocery store bread flour cartons are not enough without multiple trips to the store - do folks buy the large costco size bags and store their flour in big containers? If so which containers do you use and is there anything I should be mindful of like expiration or potential contamination? I currently keep my flour in oxo air tight containers but they only hold so much.\n\nI see some recipes that call for active dry yeast, is that different then our bread machine yeast? Can I interchange them? I am confused bc some recipes show the yeast is places in the liquid first to bloom but I know in the bread machine we keep the yeast separate and on the flour? \n\nIs it ok to simply use the machine take and knead the dough but I transfer the dough to a pan and deposit it into my oven instead? For whatever reason my machine shorts my kitchen between proofing and baking. \n\nSometimes my bread is a bit more gummy than I would like - how do I achieve that fluffy light bread? After 30-35 mins in the oven I take my bread out, keep it in the pan for 10ish minutes then take it our of the pan onto a rack and let it completely cool before slicing. \n\nLastly, is there any difference if we airate the flour or not if are using a weighted scale? So like does it make the bread texture different if I weigh first then airate or shift before putting it into the pan vs weighing and directly putting it in the pan?\n\n\n\nThanks for getting this far - my wallet and family thanks everyone for inspiring me to get back into my kitchen baking era.

I have never had a problem with salt killing/lowering the efficacy of the yeast, YMMV.", "1. I keep a few premeasures of individual ingredients I commonly use in loaves. I have small spice jars that have premeasures of salt, milk powder, and wheat germ. I keep a couple of lidded glass storage containers of bread flour. My wheat flours live in the refrigerator all year, so I don\u2019t premeasure those due to a lack of space. I used to keep premeasues of honey, but I found it not to be a time saver. You should be able to have a container that has all your dry ingredients, excluding yeast, in one container that is ready to grab if that is preferred. Yeast is best stored cold and airtight in the freezer or refrigerator. I haven\u2019t found suitable containers for premeasuring yeast and storing in the freezer, so I use canning jars and measure out as needed.\n\n2. Because of storage issues, I still buy flours in 5-pound bags rather than more economical sizes. Like you are using, airtight is the way to go. You may be able to find large airtight containers in local stores that caters to food service or preppers. Cambro containers with their tight fitting lids should also work well. Storage temperatures are important. Whole grains are better stored cool to prevent the oils going rancid. To maintain freshness, other flours are better in temperatures around 65\u00baF, cooler if needed.\n\n3. Active dry and instant yeasts (also labeled bread machine yeast) can be substituted 1:1 unless you are using a rapid cycle on your machine. In that case you would use an instant or rapid rise. \\*However\\* some good sources recommend reducing instant yeast by about 25% if using a bread machine and a recipe calling for active dry yeast, so do what works best with your ingredients. It is not necessary to bloom yeast. \n\n4. Yes, most machines have a dough cycle. It kneads and proofs, then you shape your dough to fit your pan and let it rise (covered to keep moisture in). Temperature and humidity affect rise times, but generally the goal is to bake when the dough is doubled in size. When it is getting close to that point, preheat your oven so it is ready when your dough is. A standard bake time would be 30 minutes at 350\u00baF, but you can try out what works best for you. The internal dough temperature should be around 200\u00baF.\n\n5. Remove your bread from whatever it baked in as soon as possible to prevent the loaf from steaming. Possibly this is what was contributing to gumminess. The bread is still cooking inside and you want to let that moisture leave the loaf as needed. You can cover with a kitchen towel to allow moisture to escape more slowly if desired. This can soften the crust and reduce wrinkles.\n\n6. It shouldn\u2019t matter.\n\n7. Baking is fun!", "My gosh the same idea is in the air floating around\u2026 i was just thinking the same thing using vacuum sealed jars for measuring/weighing out all the dry ingredients for 1 loaf of bread \n, except the yeast .Mark which recipe it is on the jar.

Both of these are important things to make the bread bready (so to speak.)

Did you get an instruction book with your bread maker? I googled it to help work out how to use it and there were lots of good tips and recipes on there, including the order to put the ingredients in to ensure a successful bake. \n\nI hope that helps, and in sure it\u2019s delicious!

{"title": "Any bakers here live in Italy?", "selftext": "A couple of years ago I moved from UK to Italy and brought my Panasonic bread machine with me. It hasn't made a decent loaf reliably since. The loaves don't rise properly and have a dry crumbly texture. I never had any trouble with the machine in the UK, very few bread failures if any, and I just chucked everything in the machine according to the instructions and let it do the whole process. My standard recipe was one that came with the machine, 50% white bread flour and 50% wholemeal.\n\nI concluded that the Panasonic had died ( it was probably 15 years old I guess) and bought a new Moulinex Pain Plaisir machine in Italy. The machine gets good reviews but I get much the same results with that as I did with the Panasonic in Italy. The bread doesn't rise much and is dry and crumbly. I have tried various recipes including my old 50/50 and ones that came with the Moulinex and haven't found any that work well. Recipes with only white flour work better but not great, anything with rye or wholemeal is doomed to failure.\n\nIn the UK flour is quite straightforward. There is plain flour for cakes, strong flour for bread and wholemeal bread flour is exactly what is sounds like. Generally any bread flour worked but I used to use Canadian/Manitoba flour quite often which has a higher gluten content I think. Unbleached flour is labelled \"unbleached\" on the packet. Instant dried yeast for bread machines is easy to find.\n\nIn Italy...its complicated! Flour is type 0, 00, 1, 2 and maybe 3. It never says whether its unbleached or not. They don't mention gluten but they usually have the nutritional breakdown with the amount of protein, and may have a \"W\" number which apparently indicates how much water they can absorb. A higher W seems to mean the flour can absorb more water and withstand a longer rise/ferment. Whether that also means you MUST use more water and longer rise, I don't know. Instant dried yeast is hard to find and usually expensive when you can find it. Whenever I or friends visit the UK we always bring back some yeast.\n\nI have experimented with different types and brands of flour, adding more water, adding more yeast, using bottled water etc and I haven't found the right combination yet. Even the recipes that came with the Moulinex are hard to follow exactly because they use the French flour types with a \"T\" number instead of a \"W\" number.\n\nThere must be something fundamentally different about breadmaking in Italy but I don't know what it is. There are a lot of variables. It has been driving me mad for 2 years. If anyone here lives in Italy and successfully uses a bread machine, I would love to hear your secret!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadMachines/comments/1i6u99p/any_bakers_here_live_in_italy/", "created_utc": 1737495913.0, "score": 6, "author": "BoatyMcBoatFarce", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/BreadMachines/comments/1i6u99p/any_bakers_here_live_in_italy/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["UK bread flour is fortified with vitamins and minerals, in particular there's calcium added. Italian flour isn't fortified. Also to match the UK bread flour you need about 12% protein content. Having googled, you probably want to use type 00 for the white flour, that's going to be good for bread.\n\nThe fortification is there for human health reasons but the thing about calcium is that it retards the yeast, much like adding milk does. Yeast grows the fastest when under acidic conditions (like the yeast in wine). Slowing the growth generally is considered to make better bread. Other minerals in the UK fortification may also help the yeast grow though so you could add a multivitamin to your mix if you can find a suitable pill if you really wanted.\n\nTo balance out the bread better, try adding milk instead of some or all of the water (try half to start with perhaps). I would also try getting a white bread to work well first before going for the 50:50 bread. Type 1 is wholewheat, and type 2 is very strong high protein 'semi-wholemeal' but apparently it has large grains which may not be what you want in a machine set up for British flour.\n\nI don't know about yeast, maybe you could import some Allinson easy bake yeast tins on Amazon or get someone to import them for you, they last months in the fridge after you open them.\n\nThe other thing is the water. If the water is chlorinated there you'd want to leave it to stand.
