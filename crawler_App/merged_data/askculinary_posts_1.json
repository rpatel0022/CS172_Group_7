{"title": "UPDATE: I prepared Japanese A5 Wagyu Steak for my birthday and, thanks to you guys, it was perfect", "selftext": "I got a lot of responses on [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/jyw0ea/i_want_to_order_japanese_a5_wagyu_steaks_for_my/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)  so I figured I\u2019d take the time to update everyone on how my A5 Wagyu experience went. \n\nFirst of all, thank you so much to every who responded. I learned a lot from that post and changed my wagyu night game-plan quite a bit based on those responses. If I do wagyu again I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing. \n\nI went with a [16 New York Strip](https://i.imgur.com/8QVhjS1.jpg) from Crowd Cow. I planned on doing about 6 ounces for my wife and I but upped it to 8 ounces each, which ended up being a tad too much, but we ate it all anyway (mostly me) and I have no regrets. Next time I\u2019ll do a little less but honestly it\u2019ll be more to save money. I would happily eat another 8-10oz. \n\nThe first method, based on advice received here, I cut off about half the steak and [seared on medium-high heat](https://i.imgur.com/r623lKn.jpg) for a little over 1 minute per side. It came out [rare to medium rare](https://i.imgur.com/R6O3Z5e.jpg) and I _think_ it was my personal favorite style but it\u2019s difficult to say. It\u2019s hard to judge something so amazing. We ate this by itself or with a bit of wasabi and soy sauce. Also went great with the sushi rice. \n\nNext I [sliced some thin](https://i.imgur.com/Zbluq98.jpg) and [served over sushi rice ](https://i.imgur.com/1VoiRMi.jpg)with some real Japanese wasabi, thin slice of raw garlic, and a small pinch of finishing salt. This went amazing with a touch of artisan soy sauce. Thank you to u/zonidel for this recommendation, we enjoyed it immensely and I highly recommend anyone considering doing Wagyu to try this method, as unconventional as it may seem. \n\nThe last method, which was my wife\u2019s favorite, I took 1-inch strips of the uncooked steak and seared them on a super hot pan until nicely charred. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t take a pic as I cooked these halfway through the meal and was too busy having the best experience of my life. The strips came out perfectly crispy, and although they were cooked medium to medium well throughout, were incredibly tender and melted after a couple bites. It\u2019s true what some of you told me, A5 wagyu does not need to be medium-rare. I\u2019m glad I listened to you all on that regard. \n\n[Here\u2019s a poorly lit photo of the initial spread](https://i.imgur.com/sfWF1Qy.jpg), sans the well-charred strips that were cooked later. The steaks went perfectly with some sushi rice and a Sichuan-style smashed cucumber salad. The vinegar in each provided a perfect balance to the rich steak. Shout out to u/emil10001 for the cucumber salad recommendation. \n\n[Bonus video of the steak being cut](https://i.imgur.com/HCt6IYW.mp4).\n\nThanks again to everyone who helped. I learned a lot from people I didn\u2019t mention above, u/cycocyco, u/cc69, u/alternative_reality to name a few. \n\nIf anyone has any questions about my experience please feel free to ask!\n\nI suppose since this is r/askculinary I should take advantage and ask a question. What do you all recommend I make with my leftover wagyu fat?

We didn't wind up trying Pectinex, which was the other really interesting suggestion. Unfortunately, we couldn't find some in time to experiment with it.\n\nLiquid nitrogen fast froze the raspberries in a matter of seconds. They were then easy to roll apart in our fingers and pop in the freezer for storage. We were able to set up a production line and crank through 10 pounds really fast with just four people. Our previous attempts to simply freeze the berries in the freezer resulted in too much mushiness upon thawing, but the rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen resulted in much firmer bits.\n\nAbout an hour before rehearsal, we pulled them out and spread them on sheets to defrost. The effect was exactly what the bride was hoping for.\n\nSome other suggestions that didn't work for us or we couldn't easily try:\n\n* Freeze dried raspberry bits - As I mentioned in a comment on the previous post, these were too light to throw well. Someone suggested rehydrating them. I had a pretty good guess as to what would happen, but tried it anyways. The freeze dried bits just turned to mush in water. No good. The bride really wanted fresh anyways.\n* Gelification/spherification - We actually had the stuff for this from a cocktail party we had hosted. It took a little while to get the timing down so the resulting blobs weren't too hard or soft, but the bride didn't like the way they looked. She thought they seemed unnatural and would be too much like throwing little rubber beads. She really wanted fresh berries.\n* Blasting the berries with compressed air - We didn't have fast access to a high powered compressor, but we were skeptical that this would actually work. It seemed like it was more likely to make a mess. We got liquid nitrogen working before we were motivated enough to find a compressor and try this.\n* Breaking them up in an ultrasonic water bath - This sounded interesting, but we couldn't get one quickly.\n* Pushing the berries through a screen or mesh - Before finding/building a full mesh, we prototyped with some wire. Basically, anything that involved using pressure mashed the berries too much before breaking them apart.\n* Training animals to pick them apart - WTF? We had like a day to come up with a process before the rehearsal and we aren't animal trainers.\n* Hiring blind or disabled people from a local work program - That seemed more like a suggestion for recruiting help and didn't really assist with the process of disassembling.\n* Picking them apart with blunt needles - We had already tried tweezers and were effectively already using them like blunt needles anyways. It was very slow.\n* Using fake berries - No good. Bride wanted fresh berries.\n* Using a hole punch to cut confetti from leaves - The pictures of this that people shared looked pretty, but not what the bride wanted.\n* Using pomegranates - Nope.

We added a special called the hog dog, its the hot dog split down the middle and fried on the griddle, then we fill the split with bbq, top with bbq sauce and coleslaw,  it fit our theme and our regulars really loved it.  It sold really well, but unfortunately due to rain our baseball tournament got canceled so we had to do smaller events.  However it did help us offload about 20 lbs of dogs.  The burgers were also selling pretty steadily so we don't have anything drastic to do there yet.  We have another tournament this weekend so I will update again after that.  Thanks everyone!!\n\nUpdate 2:  we had another good weekend.  We used the brisket the distributor gave us and put it on top of a burger.  We sold all but 1 serving in a day, which was great because I was eyeing that burger all day!  We also did the hog dog again and sold out.  We did another baseball tournament and worked through a few more cases of regular burgers and dogs so we are moving them pretty decently.  This week we have another brewery and more baseball so I think we are going to try chili dogs, and maybe try to play with corn dogs.  Also depending on the cost of the brisket we may put that back on the menu, people really loved it and we got some amazing compliments that made us feel really good.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ix17me/what_to_do_with_400_pounds_of_hamburgers_and/", "created_utc": 1600697649.0, "score": 1364, "author": "Stngray713", "num_comments": 498, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/ix17me/what_to_do_with_400_pounds_of_hamburgers_and/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Making Ivan Ramen's \"Vegetable fat\"?", "selftext": "As a recent vegetarian convert I've been trying out various vegetarian meals in NYC. The best one I've stumbled upon so far is Ivan ramen's vegetarian ramen, which, to simulate the unctuousness of pork/chicken stock, uses what he calls \"vegetable fat\". Ever since that meal i've been thinking about how great it would be to have that at my disposal to give that fatty deliciousness to otherwise meat-free recipes. \n\nI asked the chef what this wonderful substance was, and he said they infuse canola oil with vegetables and seaweed over a period of 5 hours. The description of Serious eats calls it \"'vegetable fat'\u2014oil flavored with their house soffrito and seaweed\" which seems to confirm that. Now I just have to figure out how to make it.\n\nAnother Ivan ramen recipe for \"Chile-Eggplant Mazemen Ramen with Pork Belly\" has a step to make a chile eggplant sofrito:\n\n\"CHILE-EGGPLANT SOFRITO\n\n1 cup canola oil\n\n1 large onion, minced (2 cups)\n\n1/2 small eggplant, minced (1 1/2 cups)\n\n2 medium tomatoes, minced (1 1/4 cups)\n\n2 1/2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder\n\nKosher salt\"\n\n\"In a large saucepan, heat the oil. Add the onion and eggplant and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft, about 1 hour. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have almost melted, about 1 hour. Stir in the chipotle powder and cook for 15 minutes longer; season with salt. Transfer the sofrito to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Drain the sofrito in a sieve; discard the oil or reserve it for another use.\"\n\n/u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt's vegan ramen recipe has another similar mushroom-scallion oil\n\n\"For the Mushroom-Scallion Oil:\n\n1/2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms\n\n1/2 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms\n\n6 scallions, very roughly chopped\n\n1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil\"\n\n\"Combine dried porcini, dried shiitake, scallions, and oil in a small saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring, until scallions and mushrooms are releasing a thin, steady stream of bubbles. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside to infuse [for about 30 minutes]\"\n\nSo, given these, it seems like for fresher vegetables, it's 1-2 hours, and for dried items, it's 15-30 minutes. I figure that the soffrito is the same for both (onion, eggplant and tomatoes) but instead of chipotle chili powder you use kombu. So I guess my last question is: how much kombu to use? Given that it's 1 oz of dried mushrooms for a 1/2 cup of the oil. It seems like the equivalent of kombu is 1 or 2 6 inch pieces of kombu. \n\nI guess that's all the results of my research.

Highly recommend!\n\nAs recommended by Samin Nosrat in her podcast, I made sure to find and purchase Diamond Kosher salt before proceeding with the recipe. After spatchcocking (we chopped the spine up into 3-4 pieces for making a chicken jus), I placed the chicken into a turkey bag and covered it with the buttermilk brine. It sat in the bag, in a baking pan in the fridge for about 36 hours.\n\nI pulled the chicken out of the marinade 1.5 hours before it was time to cook. I gave it a pat down with some paper towels and covered it loosely while it warmed up. At this time I also brought out my herb butter to soften at RT.\n\nAbout 20 min before cooking, I loosened the skin from the meat and liberally rubbed that herb butter under the skin.\n\nI pulled it out after measuring a few degrees above 165F in the thigh, but it was still so moist and tender. It was about 50-55 minutes total cooking time.\n\nI honestly forgot to rotate it once it started cooking, which I regretted after. The browning was a little off, I want sure if it was because I forgot to rotate it or because I didn\u2019t baste it. Either way it tasted amazing! Can\u2019t wait to do it again!\n\nSide note: the pan dripping were constantly burning! If someone has a tip for this I would appreciate it!

All I know about cooking I  learned from my mom as a young person (maybe 20%) and the Internet's social media as an adult (80% or more). I pride myself on being able to \"connect the dots\" and combine many different ways of preparing foods into something I find delicious. \n\nSpecifically, I combined my love for British Indian Restaurant cuisine with my decisively Western taste and tradition to make dishes that one can call fundamentally \"Western\", but which jump out and present super strong and enticing flavors to the consumer. \n\nLast night I went to make BIR style curry for the family and somehow I ended up using too much ginger and garlic paste. The final product was overwhelmingly sour, which I attributed to ginger. I was really disappointed and was considering diluting the curry with more tomatoes and fresh peppers to bring the acidity down, but that had its own set of challenges. \n\nThen I remembered a tip that I saw on this sub of using baking soda to lower acidity of dishes and decided to give it a shot, even though it intuitively seemed to me like a way to ruin a dish and make it taste \"artificial\".\n\nWell, it worked really well. One teaspoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of brown sugar brought the curry to a really good place. I'm enjoying it now and I don't detect anything \"artificial\" about it. \n\nIf it wasn't for this sub, I would have likely discarded the whole pot and started from scratch again.\n\nThank you all who contribute your very valuable experience here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/mepuo7/i_just_want_to_express_my_gratitude_to_this_sub/", "created_utc": 1616889082.0, "score": 1091, "author": "None", "num_comments": 70, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/mepuo7/i_just_want_to_express_my_gratitude_to_this_sub/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to make Salt and Vinegar Seasoning.", "selftext": "MY NEW VERSION OF THIS PROCESS IS LOCATED HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/avme9u/how_to_make_salt_and_vinegar_seasoning_updated/\n\nI am a huge fan of salt and vinegar chips. It has been my favorite go to snack every sense I was a kid. But yet I always wondered how the seasoning was made so when I dug down and did a little research I found out how industry produces the seasoning and modified the process to replicate at home. This seasoning produced in this recipe is very vinegary and worth the time involved making it!\n\nBefore we get started I just want to make clear that this process is still experimental and I am still playing around with it. Once I figure out a better way of producing it I will post it. \n\nSo to start we all know the main chemical used as the flavoring agent in Salt and Vinegar seasoning is Sodium Diacetate and industrially it is made by combing Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) with Glacial Acetic Acid (99% Pure Vinegar) to form Sodium Acetate. Then more Glacial Acidic acid is added to lock in the acidic flavor and convert the chemical over to Sodium Diacetate.\n\nBut for my process we will be using Vinegar instead of Glacial Acetic Acid, Baking Soda instead of Lye, and Citric Acid in replacement of the acetic acid. The addition of the citric acid will be explained later in the recipe.\n\nThis home version (in theory) produces Sodium Diacetate along with a small amount of Sodium Citrate without using dangerous industrial chemicals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW MAKE SALT AND VINEGAR SEASONING**\n\n1. Add **2.4L** of White Distilled Vinegar to a large pot.\n2. Add **100g** of Baking Soda to the vinegar **IN SMALL AMOUNTS!** After the solution has finished bubbling, heat the solution to 160F for 1 hour to ensure the reaction has completed.\n3. Evaporate the solution by boiling it down to about **1/10** of its original volume (or more) until you see crystals start to form at the top of the liquid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *During the evaporation process you will begin to see crystals forming on the side of the pot as well. Collect a small portion of these from the pot and set them aside to use as seed crystals for the crystallization process.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*4.* After boiling down the liquid transfer it to a clean beaker and cool the liquid in an ice bath. When the solution has cooled down to room temperature take a seed crystal and drop it into the solution. (You should immediately see the liquid start to crystallize).\n\n5. Transfer the newly formed Sodium Acetate crystals to some coffee filters and Allow it to dry. After drying the Sodium Acetate grind it into a fine powder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***(PART 2)*** **Making Salt and Vinegar Seasoning:**\n\n1. Add **140g** of Sodium Acetate to a beaker.\n2. Add **21g** of Sea Salt to the mixture along with **12g** of Corn Starch and combine well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The Corn Starch is added to prevent the seasoning from clumping after drying.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Next add **24-27g** of Citric Acid ***(This step converts (some) of the sodium acetate back to acetic acid)***. Stir the powders until the powder starts to clump up and becomes a wet slimy paste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The powder will clump together and become wet due to acetic acid forming thus combining with the left over unconverted sodium acetate. The powder is now comprised of both Sodium Acetate and Acetic Acid and possibly a little harmless sodium citrate. Which in theory is our desired sodium diacetate product. I have come up with this hypothesis because sodium diacetate is a combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid which is just what we have created.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Transfer the wet powder to a coffee filter and allow it to dry. Then grind the seasoning into a fine powder.\n\n5. Place the seasoning inside a clean container with a lid and store in a cool dry place and enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/atss0k/how_to_make_salt_and_vinegar_seasoning/", "created_utc": 1550906429.0, "score": 765, "author": "nwl5", "num_comments": 116, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/atss0k/how_to_make_salt_and_vinegar_seasoning/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Lost our caterer last minute on our wedding for 60 people. A few of us are decent cooks and want to step up to do it ourselves. We lack experience in feeding crowds larger than \u2018large family thanksgiving\u2019 - any advice?", "selftext": "Unfortunately our catering fell through last minute, and because it\u2019s 2022, everyone has rescheduled their wedding to this summer, post corona (I\u2019m in a European country that is pretty much back to normal). It\u2019s tough to find another solution.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty low-key wedding - think beach house and bonfires with relaxed food, from around 12 on Saturday to Sunday breakfast. We\u2019re looking to do three meals - the main lunch, a late night snack and a simple continental breakfast. \n\nFor the main meal, we\u2019re planning something like porcetta/roast pork, potato salad and a couple of green salads with a bunch of bread at around 2:30 in the afternoon. Also thinking Rick Stein\u2019s onion tart for the vegetarians (around 10 people). We get the keys to the house Friday night so we\u2019re going to caramelize the onions for the tarts in the days before, and then prep as much as possible the night before. Jury is out on whether we bake bread or buy it from a bakery, as there aren\u2019t many bakeries nearby.\n\nFor late night snacks, the plan is simple hotdogs, and for breakfast - buns, cheese, jam and LOTS of coffee.\n\nThe wedding is in a house that is usually used to cater to scout groups of around 60, so the equipment and space is there. We\u2019re just 3-4 people that have never catered for groups bigger than around 15-20 people. We\u2019d just love some advice, really, especially on what kind of numbers are realistic to portion per person? Do we just buy our food via a supermarket, or is it worth it to try to source it more in bulk? There isn\u2019t really a Costco equivalent here. Does the menu sound doable? Is the timing of the meal good or will people get hungry? Any advice is welcome! I fully expect to hear we\u2019re idiots for taking this on ourselves, but I\u2019ve accepted my fate and chose to post anyway. \n\nTo sum up numbers  - 60 people, most guests are early 30s, with around 10 family members who are plus 50 and expecting serious food and meat. Only 3 are kids (below 2 years). 10 vegetarians and 3 pregnant ladies.\n\nI\u2019m also looking for rough numbers for alcohol, but this might not be the right place for that. We\u2019re in a country that typically drinks a LOT (Scandinavia).\n\nEdit - corrected Rock Stein to Rick. Sorry, Rick\n\nEdit 2 - Thanks so much to everyone for all the input! It has helped a lot. The consensus here has been that we will look into getting a hog roast and grill master to accompany it - that seems doable. We will buy bread and either heat on the day from frozen, or assign a guest bread duty, and then just deal with salads and tarts the night and days before. We have already hired 2 family friends to do service, but as the event is so low key, it will be help yourself drinks from a paddling pool and pour it yourself wine on the tables. The 2 of them should be enough to keep things rolling along, especially if we have the grill master.\n\nThere are unfortunately no take out options nearby for late night snacks, but we've decided to move it earlier based on feedback regarding meal times, so will do either pasta bar, or kebab trays around 8-9 at night, based on mood. \n\nEveryone who suggested other caterers or just getting take out - the lack of nearby options is very limited, but so is budget, so we really can't just throw money at the problem, unfortunately. The pig roast option seems doable within the budget if I can find something this late, though. Doing a clam or crab bake in Northern Europe would be UNREAL expensive, though I love the idea!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/urve13/lost_our_caterer_last_minute_on_our_wedding_for/", "created_utc": 1652818837.0, "score": 681, "author": "Jisusu23", "num_comments": 144, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/urve13/lost_our_caterer_last_minute_on_our_wedding_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "The trend in toxic kitchen environments", "selftext": "This is long but I believe in intelligent discussion, and that takes words. I promise you take the time to read mine I will read yours \ud83d\ude42. If you really want to skip most of it the last two paragraphs sum it up pretty well starting at the asterisk.\n\nI wanted to pose a question to any other US cooks or chefs in this sub, only asking for US because I don\u2019t know what the environment is like overseas but if you have input feel free. I first noticed it on the line but as a sous chef I can shut it down really quick and there aren\u2019t any issues (as far as I know.) But then I started noticing it in culinary groups on a very popular social media app, you know the one, and I have seen a lot less of it here which is where I got the idea to ask it on this sub. Plus reddit tends to tolerate longer posts.\n\nSee there seems to be this culture in kitchens developing where you need to have thick skin. Let me clarify, it\u2019s always been like that, It\u2019s a fast paced environment and things can quickly get heated on the line between two cooks. You have to be able to get called out and remake something you messed up and just move on. The general mood is you aren\u2019t allowed to have your feelings hurt. However when it comes to learning the trade and getting better, I think there should be a little more acceptance. This doesn\u2019t mean that during service I\u2019m not going to say \u201cwhat the hell is this? Do it over.\u201d But I\u2019ve started to see a kind of \u201cbullying\u201d trend towards newer cooks. Almost like a \u201cI got treated like poo so now I\u2019m going to do it to someone else.\u201d Sort of thing.\n\nFor example I\u2019m in my 30s, let\u2019s say I had never learned to ride a bicycle, then post a video of me riding for the first time in a bicycle groups and ask for tips. Maybe I even fall in the video. \n\nI already know that would be super embarrassing, but in the interest of improving I post it on a biking group because I like bikes and they all seem to know a lot about them, but in doing so basically get laughed out of the group and essentially canceled. May even say screw it and go back to driving or walking everywhere. I then have to remove my video and maybe lurk in the group to try and get tips.That\u2019s what I see happen to new cooks in a lot of the groups on a regular basis even ones that are allegedly dedicated to helping others. \n\n*Laugh reacts, telling people to hang their chef coat up, making fun of them, then if the OP genuinely gets upset memes start popping up about how wimpy they are for getting their feelings hurt. My advice has been not to post in groups looking for guidance and just find a few good people you can reach out to for help, but all of these toxic chefs/cooks are all people that will be clocking into their job, this is their attitude and the culture they bring in with them.\n\nI typically call people out when I see them and try to offer something constructive to the OP, but just this last week someone all but gave up trying to improve over this weird bullying trend I\u2019ve been seeing. Have you seen this type of behavior carry over into the real world? If so how have you dealt with it? Do you think it\u2019s a leadership issue or just an attitude being popularized by hot head alcoholic celebrity chefs?*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/hrxctg/the_trend_in_toxic_kitchen_environments/", "created_utc": 1594851214.0, "score": 654, "author": "FoodServiceVeteran", "num_comments": 164, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/hrxctg/the_trend_in_toxic_kitchen_environments/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Does anyone remember old school Shanghai buttercream cake? Trying to recreate it for my grandpa's birthday and need recipe recreation advice!", "selftext": "My grandfather often talks about [these buttercream cakes](https://imgur.com/a/a6J2v3S) they used to sell in Shanghai back in the day (70s/80s). The sponge cake itself is milk flavored and light, not overly fluffy like a chiffon cake but not dense like a pound cake either. The buttercream is very yellow and rich, tastes heavily of butter, and isn't overly sweet. I've done some digging and came across [this article](https://archive.shine.cn/feature/ideal/In-search-of-the-old-Shanghai-sweetness/shdaily.shtml), which was super interesting and provided some historical context so I know what I'm aiming for. Lao Da Chang in Shanghai, my grandfather's favorite bakery, was opened in the 20s by a French native!\n\nThe biggest challenge is figuring out the buttercream: it's an extremely intense butter flavor. It's supposed to make your tongue feel waxy as you eat it. Definitely isn't seen anywhere today as it would be considered disgusting (way too rich, thick, and buttery)! My mom says there's no chance there's any whipped cream in it and when it's on a cake, it looks like straight butter piped out of a pastry bag.\n\nI'm deciding between making a French buttercream or a margarine based American buttercream. Because so many Europeans settled in Shanghai in the 1920s, all the bakeries of that time period had a lot of French influences, hence the idea of using a French buttercream. However, in the 1980s, because this type of cream cake was so expensive, the bakeries started subbing in margarine to cut down costs and make it more affordable to the middle class. I don't think it's a Swiss meringue buttercream since that doesn't make any sense in a historical context and I'm sure the ingredients/recipes back then weren't fussy at all. I also believe the yellow coloring is natural, so I'm leaning more towards egg yolks/butter/margarine.\n\nHere are a few questions I'm specifically thinking about:\n\n1. Can you make a French buttercream denser with extra butter flavor? I've made a regular French buttercream before but I think it's too light/fluffy compared to what my grandfather wants. Would I be able to just add a few more sticks of butter or would this ruin the composition?\n2. Would I be able to use margarine in a French buttercream? In the article it says that the margarine was subbed in when they made the cakes more affordable and that's why it became so creamy. I really want this buttercream to be as thick and rich and indulgent as possible, so I don't mind using an unhealthy ingredient.\n\nAny help at all would be so appreciated!! Thank you :)\n\nEdit: I've stocked up on Kerrygold butter since that seems to be the closest thing to the high quality butter from back in the day. I'll be making a batch of French buttercream, 100% margarine American buttercream, and this [old-fashioned margarine/butter buttercream recipe](https://www.pinkwhen.com/old-fashioned-vanilla-buttercream-frosting/) with half the sugar.

Now, cooking is very difficult if not impossible - I've had to use a lot of microwave cooking and many other things.\n\n\nOne thing I'm looking for specifically is something I can put on my seasoned rice to make it more interesting than just seasoned rice with a bit of dark soy sauce on it. When possible, I'll put sauced chicken, but that is a *lot* of work for me so I'm looking for options that could let me have rice as an interesting dish more often than once every four months..\n\n\nMy first thought for \"What goes well with rice?\" was what sort of things are in sushi. Based on that, I'd be interested in sweet tofu, savoury tofu, and the light green and stringy \"seaweed salad\" in some sushi which I believe is called wakame. Do any of these things come in jars or a preserved form, like Sauerkraut does? I'm also looking for minimal spice, which unfortunately rules out a lot of the Korean pickled cabbages I'd love to try, but if there are non-spicy flavoured Korean sauces/spreads/toppings that would go well I'd love to try them too. I'm also very interested in any of the things put over rice for easy meals in Chinese cuisine - I'm thinking of the sort of thing a Chinese college student might throw over rice in 3 minutes total, from a jar or a packet, to make a quick meal. I thought maybe the Chinese beef sauce I see used a lot could work? Apologies for definitely butchering that description. Doing so would probably take me more than 15 minutes even seated, and that would be a pretty hard limit on my activity.\n\n\nI am interested in suggestions from any other cultures which have easy jarred or foil packet toppings I could put on rice to make it a bit more interesting, don't feel limited to the cuisines I mentioned. I will try and locate it or an equivalent that I can get delivered here (Australia), but I recognise it's a lot of work to find that out so please just hit me with a suggestion if you think it would fit my use case.\n\n\nThank you all in advance, would really appreciate some help with this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/11vhsjs/i_am_disabled_and_looking_for_very_easy_things_to/", "created_utc": 1679221780.0, "score": 634, "author": "bjj_starter", "num_comments": 115, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/11vhsjs/i_am_disabled_and_looking_for_very_easy_things_to/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My White Whale", "selftext": "Call me Ishmael for my white whale has reared it\u2019s mighty head yet again!\n\nThere\u2019s this random tradition on my dad\u2019s side. My grand-maman would make this dessert every Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving\u2026whatever food based holiday was happening, there it was: jiggling in its large ornate bowl. It was so popular in my family that she would have to make two batches of it because one was never enough. It was called Spanish cream. Neither Spanish in origin nor containing any cream, this dessert continues to baffle. I remember watching my grand-maman make it when I was a but a wee nip. It\u2019s the most simple dessert ever: milk, gelatin, eggs, sugar, vanilla. Whenever she made it, it would always end up this creamy delicious dessert that separates into 3 distinct, albeit varying in their thickness, layers. \n\nWhen she passed away, I was about 14 or so, her death shook me to my core and so I took it upon myself that Christmas to uphold the mantle and make this dessert. I was so proud of myself, knowing everyone would feel nostalgic and happy. Suffice to say, my dad\u2019s side is made up of the most petty uber jerks who emulated my grandfather. The dessert tasted just like hers. I was so happy, I felt like she was with us. Everyone had the same response: \u201cIt tastes just like hers\u2026 but it only has two layers. Hers always had three.\u201d \n\nThus began my never ending journey. I make this dessert every holiday in her honour. I hope one day to finally achieve Taste Nirvana or the land of the Holy 3 layers. Every time I\u2019ve made it at Christmas, my dad always says: \u201cTastes just like mom\u2019s but it doesn\u2019t have 3 layers like hers.\u201d\n\nWell it\u2019s Easter, so once again I\u2019ve taken up my apron in the hopes of catching my white whale and achieving the 3 layers. It\u2019s in the fridge right now and only time will tell but something tells me, my harpoon has missed yet again.\n\nI know a lot of people say this dessert has two layers but I\u2019ve come across comments of people saying their mother or grandmother made it with 3 layers. From what I remember the 3rd layer was very small and basically in the middle of it. You had the custard-like base, the jello-y thin layer (the elusive 3rd layer) and then the top layer which is covered in small bubbles and is a lighter airy layer.\n\nI\u2019ve tried folding in the egg whites when the mix is overly cooled down (basically transforms it into a single homogeneous dessert), I tried when it\u2019s still warm (creates a really weird 2 layer version), tried when it\u2019s just room temperature which just creates the 2 layered normal version. I try different things every time. This time, I followed the recipe from my newer edition printed copy of Five Roses (the recipe I\u2019m posting is from my mom\u2019s 1980s version which is what my grand-maman used). In my version it says to bloom the gelatin in 1 cup of cold milk and put aside. Then you heat up the eggs with the rest of the milk and sugar. I chose to temper the eggs first as I didn\u2019t want to go through the fuss of a double boiler. Then you add in your bloomed gelatin and cook until dissolved. The rest is the same. Would love any help in solving this decades old mystery. \n\nSo without further ado, the recipe from Five Roses Cookbook (circa 1980s)\n\nSPANISH CREAM\n\n-3 egg yolks \u00a0\n-750 mL milk/ 3 cups\n-50 mL sugar/ \u00bc cup\n-1 mL salt/ \u00bc tsp.\n-2-7 g unsweetened gelatin/ 2-\u00bc oz\n-7 mL vanilla/ 1\u00bd tsp.\n-3 egg whites, at room temperature \u00a0\n-125 mL sugar/ \u00bd cup\n\nBeat egg yoks with fork. Add milk, 50 mL sugar and salt and beat well. Sprinkle gelatin on top. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until slightly thickened and gelatin completely dissolved, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool in refrigerator until mixture has the consistency of an egg white. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry; gradually beat in 125 mL sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Beat gelatin mixture until smooth and fold beaten egg whites into gelatin mixture. Pour into serving dish, rinsed with cold water or dessert cups. Chill in refrigerator until set, 2 to 3 hours.

As basic as it sounds, crushed potato chip crust, baked. Breasts are sliced in half, egg wash, crushed lays classic chips. We cook to 160ish and let it rest. It's quite juicy, so not dry at all. \n\n\nThe texture/grain is very thick, some parts are very tough, the flavor is very \"chicken-y\". There are different textures throughout the breast so that even with a steak knife it is hard/weird to cut and some parts are chewy or oddly textured. Leftovers taste pretty bad, with a real meaty smell/taste, I can't eat them. \n\nMeanwhile, there is a local basic restaurant that I'll get a cob salad at and the diced chicken has a tight grain, looks very different than the stuff we could make at home and has little \"chicken-y\" flavor.

I'm going to give u/TheMau 's recommendation a shot. I've got the new crust in the oven and will be heating up some extra chocolate. I'm covering the whole top in chocolate as well, so I think the damage done by moving every thing may be minimal.   \nI'll update with a picture when its done so we can either all laugh at my attempts, or hopefully be floored by how good it looks. TBD!  \n\nOP:  \nMy wife is the baker and cook in the family. I'm the order takeout or make BLTs spouse. Has always worked well, but today is her birthday and she asked me to make a specific cheesecake. One of her love languages is \"acts of service\" and so I made sure to make that cheesecake! The problem I ran into, which appears to be a common one, is that my water barrier apparently failed.\n\nThe crust ended up not being as bad as I expected after a night in the fridge, but it still wasn't good enough. I flipped it and sawed off the old crust.Now I need some advice. She'll be happy the I tried hard, but I really want to nail this thing (or atleast put up a good showing). I don't think the cheesecake itself was affected by the leakage or atleast minimally so. I was able to saw pretty effectively.\n\nSo do I:\n\nA) Call it upside down cheescake, grind up more oreos and pretzels and sprinkle them on the top with the melted chocolateOR\n\nB) Try to bake a new crust only in the pan and put the existing cheesecake on the new crust. This seems like the ideal situation, but I don't know how to account for how long to bake JUST a crust in the oven. (Pretty obvious I don't know what I'm doing by this point in the post, eh?)\n\nI work from home - so I have some time to tinker today during breaks, but not \"make a whole new cheesecake\" kind of time. \\`\n\nAny help or suggestions would be much appreciated.

{"title": "A Call to Action for r/AskCulinary", "selftext": "Preface: Please upvote so everyone can see this post. It is a self post and I will receive no karma.\n\nHello r/askculinary! Firstly, we would like to thank everyone here for making r/askculinary what we feel is the best cooking related sub reddit. With your help, we were able to grow considerably and share our knowledge with now over 23k people in 10 short months. And there is no sign of us slowing down. In due time, our community here will hopefully not only be one of the best culinary forums on Reddit, but on the entire internet as well. Very few website have a community as knowledgeable as our community here.\n\nHowever, with our increase in subscribers, we are in need of your help!\n\nIn the past few months, we have seen heavy increases in what we feel are \u201clow quality\u201d comments and posts.  I am sure most of you (especially our frequent and longtime contributors) have realized this. Many of us describe this common \u201cproblem\u201d as the so called \u201cgradual degradation\u201d of sub reddits. Basically, the more popular a sub reddit gets (or any website for that matter), the more the quality diminishes. For most websites, this is not really a \u201cproblem\u201d as this change is just a representation of your audience.\n\nHowever, r/askculinary has a specific goal. This goal is to put it simply, \u201cTo help people of all skill levels become better cooks, to increase your understanding of cooking, and to share valuable culinary knowledge.\u201d\n\nIf we are to stay true to our goal, we feel it is necessary to increase and uphold a certain \u201cstandard\u201d of quality. Not only is this necessary to keep our community on track towards accomplishing our goal, but to provide reliable and precise information to everyone.\n \n**This is where we need your help r/askculinary. In order to uphold our goal here, we need our community to be active in self-moderation.** We need your help in order to keep r/askculinary on track to achieving our constant goal.\n\nWe have an outline on what we want to see from the community, but we want to know what your thoughts are as well. **We are open to all suggestions and want to hear from everyone.** This is your chance to make r/askculinary become the community you want, so make sure your voice is heard!\n\n**Posts: We want to see posts that add conversation to our community.**  Remember, this is a community for cooks of all skill levels, from novice to expert. Everyone here is present to converse and share culinary knowledge. We love troubleshooting recipes, food science, technique advice and improving your food in general. Take advantage of this!\n\n* Posts need to be specific, well written and provide adequate detail. The more information you provide the better answer you will receive.  The best questions are those that are focused and direct. Questions that don\u2019t provide enough detail or are vague in general are not possible for us to answer correctly.\n\n* We are not here to provide recipes. Any post asking for generic recipes will be removed without hesitation.  We are here to troubleshoot the recipes, not flat out give you one, because that doesn\u2019t solve the problem or make you a better cook. Obscure or extremely specialized recipe based questions may be exempt from this rule. We are here to dissect, troubleshoot and critique the recipes, not to provide them.\n\n* Posts that mainly have to do with kitchen professionals or that are directly related to a professional environment are not suitable here. r/kitchenconfidential is your home for strictly professional responses to strictly professional questions. These include posts for war stories, work clothing recommendations, problems with your kitchen job, or industry advice. r/kitchenconfidential is filled with a much higher proportion of industry professionals than we are.\n\n* Use the search function. Many questions you have are very common and have been answered thoroughly in the past. Don\u2019t waste our time by posting something that was just posted a month ago.\n\n* If you have any question on the validity of a post, message the mods and ask.\n\n* If you see any post that you feel is inappropriate, report and downvote it. We need you to be active in your community moderation (ie: up/downvoting and reporting). When in doubt, don\u2019t hesitate. Report it!\n\n**Comments: We want to see comments that are precise and either answer the question fully or add to the conversation in a positive way.** The more detail you provide, the better this serves everyone. Having intelligent, respectful gastronomic conversation is a true joy for many of us here.\n\n* Comments must be accurate and well informed. You do NOT need to be a chef or work in the industry to comment. You do however have to be informed in your response. We realize cooking is very subjective and in a lot of cases there is no \u201cright\u201d way to cook something. With this being said, your comment must have substance and validity.\n\n* Your comments must be precise and well written. Short one or two word responses are not appropriate. Elaborate as much as possible while keeping true to the question. If you don\u2019t have anything that adds to the conversation and are just posting some personal anecdote, don\u2019t bother. These comments do nothing but crowd and diminish the quality of the thread.\n\n* Keep your comments on topic. This is not a place to joke, make puns or meme references. If you don\u2019t have anything constructive to say, do not comment. People come here to have intelligent conversation about cooking, not to get a chuckle in.\n\n* If you see anything that violates these rules, be sure to report and downvote the material. Do not hesitate. If you\u2019re not sure, report it. This is absolutely crucial to our future success.\n\n\n**Remember, it is crucial that you do your part in terms of self-moderation. If you see anything you think is out of line, report it.** We mods can\u2019t do this by ourselves and we are putting our trust in the community to help us out.\n\nSpeaking of mods, with our increase in moderation, we are looking for a couple more. If you feel like you would be able to help out, let us know. It is a thankless job that can take a good portion of time, so be warned. Send us a message if you are interested and we can provide an outline of what the duties specifically are.\n\nLastly, we are in the works of working on an r/askculinary wiki. The amount of information that has already been shared here is incredible, and to be able to organize this information we need more than a short FAQ. In addition, we have a major sidebar renovation in the works as well. This will be implemented in the near future and we will follow up with a mod post when this occurs. This new sidebar will hopefully outline our goals and intentions better and be easier and more understandable to read.\n\nThank you r/askculinary and cheers to the future!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/11z2hl/a_call_to_action_for_raskculinary/", "created_utc": 1351033590.0, "score": 521, "author": "unseenpuppet", "num_comments": 91, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/11z2hl/a_call_to_action_for_raskculinary/", "html_title": ""}

I've since moved to WA state, where I am almost as far from a waffle house as I can be in the continental USA... And so I have had to resort to trying to recreate the object of my desires myself.\n\nI am using their provided mix, with the syrup they ostensibly use in the restaurants (blackburn syrup, as confirmed by a wafflehouse twitter account), I am using a goldenmalted waffle iron (fairly higher end consumer grade iron, not belgian style), which is about the only difference that I can think of. I have tried cooking the waffle throughout the entire range of selectable temperatures on the iron, ranging from soggy in the middle to completely overcooked. I have tried both immediately cooking the mix, as well as resting it overnight in the fridge (as the instructions indicate to do, though notably this does not seem to be done in the restaurants as far as I can tell, with the batter being made fresh at the start of the day?). To the mix, I am just adding half and half and the eggs, as specified by the waffle house mix instructions.\n\nI sort of doubt the waffle iron is the issue, but everything else should be exactly as they do it at the restaurants, and yet mine always seem to end up dry and brittle- not pillowy like in the restaurants. The flavor also seems to just be not there, only being about half as good.

{"title": "A Cilantro Substitute Made By People Who Like Cilantro?", "selftext": "Hello all! I'm one of those who lost the genetic lottery when it comes to cilantro - and honestly, soapy-tasting food is NOT great. I've tried just leaving cilantro out of food, or subbing in parsley, but 1) people tell me that changing the recipe *isn't authentic,* and 2) that parsley doesn't taste like cilantro.\n\nThe problem is that soapy-tasting food isn't 'authentic' either, because I'm not tasting what the creators of the recipe are tasting! And the problem with the substitutions deal is that people who like cilantro use cilantro, and the people who can't taste cilantro the same way are left trying to make a substitution for a flavor we can't taste!\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone who LIKES cilantro has tried to make an herb blend or substitution that tastes like cilantro SHOULD taste, so people who've lost the genetic lottery can get an idea of what of cilantro-heavy recipes should actually taste like? I don't care if it's a complicated mix or blend, I know the \"parsley & lemon\" suggestion but not exact measurements, and I'm really looking for something more precise. I want to hit as close to the flavor - as it should be - to be authentic to the recipe.\n\nThe most detail I've gotten about cilantro's taste is that it's 'kind of citrusy'...\n\nPost has been locked now, sadly, but this is what I've gleaned from comments:\n\nFrom my own research: parsley, or parsley and lime; dill; caraway? I know dill is distinctly different. One source says caraway is 'almost interchangeable' with cilantro - can lovers of cilantro confirm or deny this? I've also heard about culantro, as well. From comments, this is the information you've shared: I won't be able to get all of the herbs, and some I may have to get seeds for and try growing, but I'll try a few of these and see what kind of results I get!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions I still have:\n\n\\- Does \\*pickling\\* cilantro or soaking it in lemon/lime juice change the flavor to the point it's unrecognizeable? Since my end goal is to taste cilantro the way most people do!\n\n\\- Peppercorns? Vs Caroway maybe?\n\n\\- Are papalo and papalaquito the same herb?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom VicVox72 - pickled cilantro?\n\nFrom bc2zb - seconds pickling (using acids to convert aldehydes into hydrates); also suggests papalaquito and culantro\n\nFrom GrinningDentrassi - also recommends acids\n\nFrom Moosymo/othersideReflections - culantro more mild, less vinegar to counter maybe?\n\nFrom figgypudding531 - celery leaves?\n\nFrom wooly\\_bully - seconds celery leaves\n\nFrom zestyclose-market858 - thai basil - not the same but a good sub\n\nFrom ronearc - 4 to 1 ratio of parsley to mint with a squeeze of lime?\n\nFrom kuroninjaofshadows - rau ram?\n\nFrom Texnessa - culantro is also called 'saw-leaf'; taste is mostly from aroma, try chiffoading, spreading out, and leaving out for a half hour to let the gasses evaporate??\n\nFrom BeneficialBean - mix of fresh parsley, lime, white or rose peppercorns or allspice? (has anyone tried this and can suggest a mix that is the most cilantro-y? I've also heard cumin and carroway, but I've not seen peppercorn or allspice suggested!)\n\nFrom paradiseislands - sea arrowgrass (forageable herb in the uk) tastes like 'salty cilantro'?\n\nFrom GuinessforDinner - plant called 'Salad Burnet' - 'looks like parsley, lightly herby and mostly like cucumber'\n\n(From multiples) Coriander seed (not AS soapy as cilantro?) and lime\n\nFrom Imidaho - papalo herb ('pineapply flavor') - is this the same herb as papaloquito?\n\nFrom  **SVAuspicious** \\- parsley, lemon/lime juice, and sprinkle of ground ginger!\n\nThanks everyone who answered!!

I should probably also get a bread knife and paring knife. But I should buy them each individually rather than in a packaged set.\n\nC) Buy knives in a store so you can pick them up and see how they feel because knives are very subjective.\n\nI also got some great brand recommendations and am relieved to see that I can find a good balance of quality/reliability at the under $50 range.

{"title": "Incredibly Eye-Watering Onions - What's why these?", "selftext": "A few weeks ago, a coworker who goes to the foodbank regularly received WAY too many bags of onions from them (I think they were bulk donated and the food bank had to get rid of them.) So she gave some bags to her coworkers, us included.\n\nI've been an enthusiastic home cook for the past 18 years and I love onions, so although these yellow onions were small (only slightly larger than pearl onions, about the size of a golf ball) I was happy to receive them. \n\nLast night as I was cutting them up for beef stroganoff, I was suddenly hit with chemical-warfare levels of syn-propanethial-S-oxide. I went from being clear eyed to tearing up so badly that it was unsafe for me to continue cutting them because I was basically blind. I ran out of the kitchen and said to my wife \"Those are the strongest onions I've ever cut!\" I stayed out of the kitchen for about a minute, until I recovered, and went back in - the moment I crossed the threshold to the kitchen the sensation came right back. I put on the fume hood fan and set a burner burning on the stove and barely finished cutting them before throwing them in a waiting pan. After they cooked, they were deliciously oniony (more so than usual).\n\nI've been chopping onions of every breed, make and model for almost 20 years. I have NEVER encountered onions this strong - they are an order of magnitude worse than the next worst onions I've ever cut up. Here's a picture of one of the offenders https://imgur.com/gallery/eWitBF2\n\nSo I know to use sharp knives and all the usual tricks for stinky onions, but these were so above and beyond what I'm used to that I basically don't want to even use the rest unless they're roasted whole.\n\nThe only thing I can think is that since they are small, I had to cut many of them up to make the portion of a normal size onion - is that a thing? I would think the amount of syn-prop would be roughly the same per oz. no matter the overall size of the onion. Is the same amount of syn-prop that would be in a large onion just concentrated in a small onion?\n\nThat said, I was wondering if there is a reason that these onions would be so strong, and also so flavorful when cooked. Is there a specific breed or region where really stinky onions are grown? Do extra-stinky chemical-warfare-levels of stink have any culinary uses?\n\nAlso, any idea what else to do with this giant bag that doesn't involve cutting them up or roasting them whole?\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/lep74i/incredibly_eyewatering_onions_whats_why_these/", "created_utc": 1612713798.0, "score": 475, "author": "jwilder204", "num_comments": 109, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/lep74i/incredibly_eyewatering_onions_whats_why_these/", "html_title": ""}

About two months ago I tried looking online to buy this candy by itself without the powder but they don't sell individual Lik-a-Stix and anything online that claims to be similar to it is just hard candy lies (Looking at you Oriental Trading Company).  I've even gone as far to contact the manufacturers of Fun Dip and they emailed me back only to shoot me down and crush my dreams. So now I want to make my own, and here is where you (hopefully) come in (please I'm desperate).\n\nLik-a-Stix are not hard candy, they're a powdery chalky candy that are supposedly flavored like marshmallows. They have similar consistency to a chalky mint or a candy cigarette but are still slightly different.

I braised the carrots and onions first, added tomatoes paste, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, beef stock, dumped into the crockpot over some russet potatoes (peeled and chopped).

We're thrilled that so many others find this community as informative and entertaining as we do. Our readership includes cooks of all skill levels, from pro chefs to total beginners, and it's wonderful to see everyone coming together to help each other out.\n\nSince our corner of reddit is growing, the mod team thought it was a good time to post a refresher on our rules:\n\n**POSTING:**  \n\nWe're best at:  \n* Troubleshooting dishes/menus  \n* Equipment questions  \n* Food science  \n* Questions about technique\n\nSo please Keep Questions:  \n* Specific (Have a goal in mind!)  \n* Detailed (Include the recipe, pictures etc.)  \n\nThis will ensure you get the best answers.\n\nQuestions with many potential answers belong in r/cooking or a specialty sub, of which there are many--e.g. 'What should I cook tonight?' or 'What should I do with this rutabaga?'  \nQuestions with a single correct answer belong here--e.g. 'What makes my eggs turn rubbery in the oven?' or 'Is the vegetable in this picture a rutabaga?'\n\nHere's what not to do:\n\n* NO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF FOOD SAFETY. We can't tell you anything about the specific packet of chicken or pot of soup you left out overnight. General questions about good food safety practices are allowed, but for specific situations we recommend you consult government food safety guidelines for your area and when in doubt, throw it out.  \n\n* PROVIDE AS MUCH INFO AS YOU CAN. We can't help you if you don't tell us what you've already done first. Please provide the recipe you're working from and tell us what went wrong with it or what you'd like to improve about it. \"I've tried everything\" isn't specific enough. If you're following a video recipe, consider putting a timestamp at the relevant portion of the video or writing out the recipe in text form.  \n \n* NO RECIPE REQUESTS. If you have a recipe you'd like help adjusting or troubleshooting, we'd love to help you! But /r/AskCulinary is not in the business of providing recipes. There are tons of other subreddits that can help you with that.  \n \n* NO BRAINSTORMING. We do make exceptions for mass quantities (real past examples: wheelbarrow full of walnuts; nearly 400 ounces of canned tuna; 50 lbs of whole chicken), but \"What do I do with my last three limes?\" or \"What should I serve with this pork loin?\" should go to /r/cooking. We also make exceptions for rare or unusual ingredients that /r/cooking might not have the expertise to handle.  \n\n* NO BRAND RECOMMENDATIONS or \"What piece of equipment should I get?\" posts. It's very rare that one person has enough experience with multiple brands or models of a particular item to provide an objective response. We suggest you consult sources like Consumer Reports.\n\n* NO GENERAL DISCUSSION. /r/AskCulinary is modeled after /r/AskScience and /r/AskHistorians, not /r/AskReddit.

We can tell if you came here just to argue with people, and we will remove your post on the grounds that the question was asked in bad faith.\n\n**COMMENTING:**  \n\n* BE NICE TO EACH OTHER. Politeness is not optional at /r/AskCulinary. We're all here to help each other learn new things and succeed in the kitchen.\n\n* TOP LEVEL COMMENTS MUST ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. Saying \"oh hey, I always wondered that too!\" or \"try it and let us know!\" doesn't help OP. Comments asking for more information and comments made in good faith that don't directly address OP's exact question but provide an alternate solution are OK.\n \n* NO LINKS WITHOUT EXPLANATION. The reason people come to /r/AskCulinary is because the people who answer questions here are real people with real kitchen advice. If you find a good source that answers OP's question, please provide it! But also provide at least a little bit of extra information so OP knows what they're clicking on and what to expect.\n \n* NO JOKES. We're here to help OP. If OP comes back to their post and finds a dick joke about sausages instead of a helpful answer, they're going to be disappointed. Remember that our main goal is to be helpful.\n\n* STAY ON SUBJECT. Posts here present questions to be answered, not prompts for a general subjects of discusison. If a post does spark a question for you, please ask it in a separate post (in /r/Cooking or a specialty sub if it doesn't fit the requirements above).\n\nFULL COMMENT ETIQUETTE POLICY: Comments should be factual, helpful, thorough, and respectful.

{"title": "Really confused what's going on with this petite tender", "selftext": "Hi there everyone. My girlfriend and I went to our local butcher today and asked for a recommendation for a cut of beef that would go with a mushroom + veal demiglace wine sauce pasta dish. We were suggested a couple of these petite tenders. We've never worked with the particular cut before, but the butcher explained that we'd have to remove the silver skin and from his description the process sounded relatively simple.\n\nWell, when we got around to preparation, we had a lot of problems with removing that silver skin. I'm just going to go ahead and post some images.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AKT1Fzi\n\nObviously the cut is basically destroyed at this point. As we tried to cut away the silver skin, we ended up having to take out relatively large chunks of meat, which ended up revealing more silver skin inside. There was also this pretty thick bundle (a tendon or something?) at both ends (most visible in the third image) that ran through the center, and after tearing the cut open in frustration, we discovered that the whole thing is basically infused with a thick lattice of the stuff. There was basically no usable amount of meat that we could separate from it.\n\nI'm willing to entertain the possibility that we're just dumb and that this is not silver skin and is very normal, so if that's the case, please just tell me, but if it isn't, what went wrong here? Was the cut mislabeled? Was it improperly prepared by the butcher? Something else?\n\nAnother note, we got two of these tenders, and the other one *was* very easy to prepare. It was also a tad darker and browner, whereas this one was a brighter red.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to say, thanks to everyone for helping me out.

I really felt like shrimp cocktail and to be honest, it was all bar food type place so I didn\u2019t expect a ton from the shrimp.  Turns out they were awesome, nice big shrimp, cooked perfectly tender, all fully deveined cleanly and tail still on. \n\nLater that same day, we were out at a nicer place, great reputation,  bit of a touristy place but still pretty highly rated even by locals. They had several \u201csister restaurants\u201d in the same town, so whole not a chain, it had a bit of a corporate feel. They were out of what I wanted so I ordered a country boil style dish that was corn on the cob, shell fish, sausage, potatoes all steamed as tossed with old bay. It was as good as I expected it to be,  but the shrimp all had giant black veins. They were shell on with legs, decent size and there was about 6 of them. I was a little grossed out by the vein but I ate some anyway and then attempted to devein the rest before I ate them (which I found very challenging on cooked shrimp). \n\nThis experience in one day kind of mimicked what I feel like I\u2019ve generally come to expect when ordering shrimp out.

{"title": "Accidentally made the best batch of toum in my life and can't quite explain it", "selftext": "This post is to understand the underlying science behind what I did and how it yielded a desirable result. Toum is a garlic condiment that's traditionally made with freshly peeled garlic, salt, lemon, and oil. The garlic is first blended into a paste with some salt, then oil is slowly poured in to start an emulsified solution. Once emulsification of the solution has began you usually alternate lemon (and/or cold water), with oil.   \n\n\nI always have issues with this method. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. I've wasted countless ingredients trying to get it right. Furthermore, unless I take out the garlic germ I end up with a overly powerful result.   \n\n\nToday, I decided to try my luck at it again using a hand immersion blender and the narrow measuring cup it comes with. I threw in just enough pre-peeled frozen garlic to cover the bottom of the cup with some salt, added equal parts lemon and cold water , and equal parts oil to the liquid solution. I then blended it. Once I got a uniform consistency (it was still very liquidy) I started drizzling the rest of the oil slowly. I ended up with a perfectly silky and smooth result not like mayo, but like the consistency of heavy whipping cream that been whipped just long enough to just started forming peaks, but loose enough it can still easily be spooned. I couldn't believe it. I didn't realize that this shortcut would allow me to still emulsify the solution. Why don't traditional methods just throw all the ingredients like that then emulsify it further to thicken it up? Is that what happened here?\n\nEdit: the recipe is being requested in the comments. I didn\u2019t record it but these are the rough measurements:\n\n-7 to 10 medium FROZEN garlic cloves (enough to at least the bottom of the blender cup\n\n-healthy pinch of kosher salt\n\n-quarter cup of chilled lemon juice and water. Up to you how much acidity you want in the final product so adjust according to taste\n\n-1-2 cups or more of neutral oil. I would avoid using heavier oils like avocado. \n\nDirections\n\n1. Add the garlic and salt to the bottom of the cup\n2. Add the liquid (the blades should be fully immersive in the liquid part)\n3. Add half of you oil, the layer of oil will settle above the liquid\n4. Turn the blender on high and blend the solution until you get a viscous liquid\n5. With the blender still running add a steady stream of oil. You\u2019ll notice it start to thicken. You can start to move the blender up and down in the cup to get a uniform solution. \n\nThis isn\u2019t an exact recipe and YMMV!

So if I can achieve good results without it I\u2019d kind of prefer that. \n\nThe recipe I most often use is: 530g of plain flour; 1/2 tsp salt; 7g of fast-action dried yeast; 40g of caster sugar; 15g of baking powder; 50ml of milk; 200-250ml of warm water (200ml to start, then I dribble in up to 50ml more, a tsp at a time if I need it to come together); 25ml of vegetable oil. \n\nTaking my lead from the low gluten flour idea, I knead it as little as possible - as soon as it\u2019s smooth and tacky I leave it alone. I\u2019ve never had any issue with my dough not rising so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with the proving.\n\nI tend to roll them out on an oiled rather than a floured surface since I need to oil them anyway. \n\nFor the folded over bao you make a sandwich out of (I don\u2019t know the proper name, sorry!)

After years of determined patronage, my colleagues and I have been granted a life changing opportunity - Mr. Li recently knocked down the bathroom walls to install a tiny kitchen area and a very legit pizza oven; but he has no idea how to make a pizza.  And later this week I will deliver his strategy and plan for making dough, making pizza.  \n\nWe're asking for a basic strategy for making simple, ideal dough; small area to operate, limited imported ingredients, and no basic culinary skills by the proprietor.  A basic marinara sauce and moz cheese can be purchased cheaply at our expat grocer, toppings will be limited to tomato and other veggies that can go on uncooked.  Any meat will have to be an uncooked product, salami, pepperoni.  \n \nIf you've ever lived in mainland China, you may know...It's a very hearty diet of chicken feet and regret.  Next week I will show Mr. Li how to make dough (and his two workers) and how to make a pizza.  I'm reaching out to you guys in hope for a simple and easy game-plan that can turn around 5 large pizzas per night, without using up too much storage space in the fridge and freezer.  We're interested in a pretty detailed step by step as, myself and colleagues are really limited in this area.  Some help from people with better sense on how to game-plan this would literally change our lives forever and we'd be over the moon to have a decent pie at our local.  Anyone that can help, I'd love to send you some funny trinkets via post as appreciation, from mainland China, and for sure a year of gold.  \n\nThe idea of having a pie here that doesn't taste like Chinese regret would be amazing.  I am going to give Mr. Li a tutorial next week with some basic plans for how much dough he needs per day, how to make it, and how to cook it.  If you can help us with a solid plan it would be amazing.  I know I can look up a basic dough recipe on youtube which I've done any time I've made for myself, but I'm also really keen to hear good advice for trying to make about 5 pies a night, how to cook it for a first timer, dough storage, time-tables, and anything you think might help us eat...a nice slice of pizza. \n\nThank you guys, Cirque du Soleil tickets for the highest helper :)  Come see us perform!

You can also find frozen, minced garlic in markets. These are fine as long as there are no preservatives added.\n\n**Ginger:** Can be peeled in advance and stored in the freezer. No need to defrost before grating.\n\n**Greens:** Heartier greens such as collard greens, kale, Swiss chard, and beet greens can be washed and sliced or chopped 2 to 3 days in advance. More tender greens such as butter, romaine, red leaf, or green leaf lettuce can be washed 2 to 3 days in advance.

This morning I blitzed a test batch in the microwave on high for 3 cycles of 2 minutes (after transferring to porcelain, not in my cast iron, just for safety and clarity's sake haha) each without adding any alkalinising agent and the potatoes actually became just tender enough! I microwaved the rest of the dish for brunch and it's quite well softened, thank God =)\n\nThis is *stumping* me because this is the first time I have ever had this problem.\n\nBACKGROUND: I am not an expert home cook, but am certainly more than a novice. I tried to make scalloped potatoes tonight for the first time. I used one of my beloved cast irons, my babies, the lights of my life. I used [the following Tasty recipe](https://tasty.co/recipe/cheesy-scalloped-potatoes) and as always looked at the tips on the app before I started. Felt good, although I knew I'd have to make some substitutions because I live in India and can't find many ingredients in my town. Here's the list of the substitutions I made:\n\n* medium-sized standard Indian potatoes instead of medium-sized Yukon Gold which is not available here (also on the starchier side, but also a bit waxy)\n* used homemade vegetable broth instead of bouillon\u2014broth was made of celery, potatoes, carrots, onions and spices (with a couple tablespoons of homemade tomato paste made from cast-iron-roasted tomatoes, garlic and lemon juice)\n* cornflour (as in fine cornmeal) instead of APF for the roux and cheddar instead of nutritional yeast for the b\u00e9chamel, and also added some heavy cream in the b\u00e9chamel since I didn't have that much cheese on hand and wanted to tightly control the thickness (specifically, to make it less thick than I usually make it)\n* added chopped leeks when layering the potatoes and onions\n* added a layer of cheddar cheese along with the first layer of b\u00e9chamel\n* added a layer of ch\u00e8vre on top of the top layer of b\u00e9chamel\n* was more generous with the b\u00e9chamel than they show in the video for the recipe\n* used an oven-toaster-grill capable of hitting 230\u00b0C (recipe calls for 200\u00b0C\u2014I remembered to preheat the oven, I poured the b\u00e9chamel piping hot over the potatoes)\n\nPROBLEM: after cooking for *two hours*, then transferring to stove top and cooking on *high* for *another hour*: the potatoes were mostly raw. They were goddamn raw. They simply didn't tenderise at all like they've done in other recipes in the past. They weren't pre-boiled potatoes, and Indian potatoes do seem to take a little longer than most western varieties, but this is just ridiculous. 1/8\" thick just like the recipe calls for (in fact that's the only thickness the mandolin I used has) and covered in sauce all over and they were *raw*. They failed the fork test. They tasted uncooked, as if they were freshly cut. The onions cooked well and the ch\u00e8vre melted, though, and the pan was scalding hot when it came out so it's definitely not a heat problem.\n\nI'm just so confused as to how this could happen???? Could someone provide any insight? I spent a lot of time (and money!) on this dish so I've fridged it for now and I'm going to attempt another bake in the morning, I'm not chucking it.

I'm not sure why the recipe insists on a boil instead of a simmer, but my guess is that a simmer won't break stuff down enough? The skin, cartilage, fat, tendons, and marrow are supposed to break down, emulsify, and create a stock so thick that it is a solid block at room temperature. \n\nI burned it.\n\nI used a covered, lightweight stainless steel pot. I maintained enough water to cover the solids. I kept the heat as low as possible to maintain a rolling boil, about medium low. I stirred roughly every 30 minutes. But after a few hours, some solids stuck to the bottom and created a burnt taste throughout the whole stock. I've switched to a heavier nonstick pot and am seeing if that will make a difference, but it looks like it might be starting to stick again.\n\nHow do I keep this from happening again?\n\nAdvice I've found so far:\n\nThe recipe says to use a \"heavy bottomed\" pot, but I don't understand what that means other than something thicker than a particularly thin pot. I don't understand what difference it makes. \n\nI've also seen advice to bring the pot to a boil and then put it in the oven at like 200 degrees. Even if I remove the top rack, I'm unclear on how I'd go about stirring a pot of 10 pounds of meat and a couple gallons of liquid that doesn't have the clearance to get a spoon in without touching the ceiling of the oven. It doesn't seem practical to take it out every time I stir. People who use this technique, how do you stir? How often do you need to stir?\n\n**Update:** Thank you all for your help so far. I'm trying a technique of a roiling boil in the thickest bottom pot I have. From what you all are saying, it sounds like the reason the recipe specifies \"boil don't simmer\" is that a roiling boil will keep the solids from sticking to the bottom. The thick bottom apparently keeps the heat even, which is especially an issue on an electric stove. I'll get back to you all if this doesn't work. \n\nA thing  I'm still unclear on is how to judge how much liquid I need to maintain, especially when it starts to get thick.\n\n**Update 2**:  I'm getting a nice even roiling boil with my heavy bottom pot, as well as the foam that is supposed to accumulate at the top but hadn't before. However, already the bottom has stuff stuck to it. Possibly because the stock is as thick as gravy now. But how is it supposed to reduce if I keep adding liquid to thin it?\n\n**Update 3:** IT IS ALL STICKING AND BURNING HELP\n\n**Update 4:** The power went out. I am defeated. I've gotten some good suggestions since update 3, but won't be able to try them until another day. I'm still open to further suggestions, and also to more explanations of what the broth's thickness and level of reduction should be like as it cooks.

My mom doesn't have any cast iron or pans that are oven safe- just cookie sheets. She also gave away my griddle to my other sister so I can't use that either.\n\nLast time I made this many I preheated the oven to 450F with a cookie sheet in it to get hot. Then I used the griddle to sear them for a few min on one side then flipped them over and put them on the hot cookie sheet and baked them for another 7ish minutes. But now my griddle is gone.\n\nShould I get one of those cast iron things to put over the burners of her stovetop? It's a glass top if that makes a difference. Any ideas are much appreciated.

I don\u2019t want to be to dramatic about it as it\u2019s not like we\u2019re dying or on a ventilator or anything but it\u2019s surprisingly detrimental to our mental health to have nothing smell delicious and everything taste like\u2026 what I imagine the color beige tastes like. Like probably a lot of people we get significant joy from good food.\n\nWas wondering if anybody had any ideas for food that I could cook that would taste \"right\" without relying on aroma. (Normally I like balanced or even delicate flavors over something that just hits you over the head with the flavor knob turned to 11 like, say, Indian food, but I\u2019m just so desperate for taste right now I\u2019d be happy with a flavor sledgehammer.)\n\nMeat without the smell of seared crust is meh. Pan sauce is all aromatics so it\u2019s just kind of a slightly acidic butter thing... without the smell of butter. Bacon without the smell is just salty fat (with an admittedly fun texture). Salmon might as well be any tasteless flaky white fish. Indian food at least tasted like something but a lot of it is the smell and we weren\u2019t getting any of it. Pasta is alright but we can\u2019t smell the tomatoes, the spices, or cheese if there\u2019s cheese. I baked a fresh loaf of bread in the over the other day and when I got it out I got that blast of warm air from the oven, and... no wonderful smell, no nothing - it was actually kind of upsetting.\n\nProbably the 'best' food right now (as in reminds us the most of pre-covid taste) has been grapes, where what I'm mostly getting is sweet, a fruit flavor (I'm sure I'm missing some fruit smell but... I can't remember what that was like anymore :/), and a crisp cold liquid sensation, so I'm getting the majority of that. But, if anybody has any ideas of cooked, prepared food that is mostly flavor and not so much about the aroma, that would be great. I'm pretty pessimistic, to be honest - most of taste seems to be smell.\n\n\\*By \u201clost\u201d sense of smell it seems to be <100% loss. If I fry up a pan of bacon I don\u2019t smell anything.

{"title": "Stir-frying contradicts a lot I've learned about cooking so far", "selftext": "For over a year now I've been learning about cooking but recently I started looking into stir-frying and there are some things that confuse me about this and high-heat cooking in general that I would love to clear up.  \nFirst of all, it's always emphasised that originally Asian restaurants use a jet engine heat and there are a few other recipes (burgers) where the oil needs to \"start smoking\". This always confuses me because I thought burned oil is bad. Is there a difference between smoking and burning or is burning oil sometimes desired for whatever reason?  \nAnother thing. In European cooking the recipe starts by cooking aromatics in oil to infuse it with flavor. In stir-fries I see all kinds of orders. Kenji's Fried Rice order: rice -> meat -> vegetables + aromatics -> sauce. Gordon Ramsay's stir fry (see the recent \"Ramsay in 10\"): meat + aromatics (take out when done) -> vegetables (take out when done) -> rice. I notice aromatics are not the base for the whole dish in both cases but for some reason Gordon puts them with meat and Kenji basically at the end. What is the role of aromatics in stir-fries? Is it treated like a vegetable? Is there no \"infusion\"?  \nLast issue I have is nonstick pans. I noticed that Gordon uses nonstick pans in a lot of the videos including those about deep-frying and stir-frying. Also, Kenji in his article about fried rice suggest nonstick as the best alternative for induction stovetops. I thought that high-high cooking in those is toxic. They don't care? It's not as big of a deal as I thought? It's not like that anymore because technology got better? The toxic temperature is much higher than smoking oil?  \nI like to know the reasoning behind techniques and I couldn't find answer for those. I would be very grateful if you, as professionals, could explain those ambiguities.   \n   \ntl;dr: Isn't smoking oil bad? When should I add aromatics and what's their function?

Buy a **small oven toaster** -> similar to what you'll get from an airfryer but has the advantage of being multifunctional.\n\n3. Buy a **deep fryer** -> ability to fry easier with less smell and mess\n\n4. Buy a **splatter screen/guard** or make your own by punching holes on an aluminum foil\n\n5. **Air purifier** or **odor-absorbing beads/gels** -> to help with smell\n\n6.

{"title": "Cantonese/Southern Chinese Cookbooks", "selftext": "I recently purchased two Fuchsia Dunlop books on regional Chinese cooking--*The Food of Sichuan* and *Land of Fish and Rice* (Jiangnan)--and I was blown away.

They're also massive books with tons of recipes representing a diverse range of dishes in the region (including recipes influenced from outside the region but adapted for local tastes). And it's easy to follow, particularly for a Westerner shopping at mostly Western supermarkets. I also bought Terry Tan's Mandarin that has 75 Northern Chinese recipes. It's not nearly as nice, but it's still good enough for these purposes. But it doesn't look like Fuchsia Dunlop wrote a book on Cantonese cooking.\n\nI say Cantonese, but I'm also ok with anything focusing on South China (meaning Huanan \u83ef\u5357): Guangdong Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau (maybe Fujian, but I'm not sure).

I can aggregate them later. Example:\n\n**German:**\n\n* Mustard\n\nI'm trying to see if there are cultures that naturally have \"culinary affinity\" to each other by pairing them together based on common seasoning profiles. I'd identify these by putting your entries together into a big \"cultural seasoning profile dataset\" and using the data manipulation skills I've picked up over the years to identify overlapping areas.\n\nIf there's a high number of spices/ingredients that overlap, then I'd take a closer look at popular dishes from each of the cuisines and see how they'd work if they were cooked \"cross-culturally.\" The ultimate goal being to identify tasty dishes made possible with cross-cultural seasoning choices that would otherwise not be super obvious.\n\nOne example: Korean and Mexican food. Both cuisines rely heavily on garlic, onion, and peppers (broadly speaking) as seasoning elements.

Our goal with this sub has always been to have a place users could go to get troubleshooting help for things they are trying to cook.  This makes it so that relevant quick answers are the most useful to people asking questions.  We've tried to help promote engagement on less popular new posts by locking threads that are popular but have run their course and started to devolve into open discussions.  While these may be fun and interesting they are the antithesis of what we are trying to accomplish here. We're hoping that this new 48 hour rule will find a balance between helping new posts getting answers and allowing user to have some fun discussions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jubxhg/rule_change_for_post_locking/", "created_utc": 1744113999.0, "score": 369, "author": "AutoModerator", "num_comments": 42, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jubxhg/rule_change_for_post_locking/", "html_title": ""}

Mostly, those changes affect the flavor of the brownies. I weigh every ingredient (smaller weights on a precise scale) so I'm confident that the biggest variable at this point is the oil type.\n\nThe recipe mentions that the ratio of oil to butter is the key to achieving the desired texture - presumably because of the saturated-to-unsaturated fat ratio. However, I've noticed that the particular variety of neutral oil I use also has a dramatic impact on the texture, even though the sat-to-unsat fat ratios on the oils are extremely similar.\n\nSpecifically when I use [sunflower oil](https://www.spectrumorganics.com/product/organic-sunflower-oil/), the brownies come out super sticky. When I use [safflower oil](https://www.spectrumorganics.com/product/safflower-oil/), they're not as sticky and instead feel denser (links to the brand I most often get and their nutrition facts). The difference is very noticeable, not just a slight change.

I *can* use herbs from the Lamiaceae/Labiatae family (mint, sage, basil, thyme, oregano, tarragon, etc.), but those almost never show up in Indian cuisine as far as I know, and it's been decades since I've ate anything with cumin or coriander, so I don't really remember how much the flavor profile can be replicated with them.\n\nSo the question is, with those elements, *can* I successfully mimic the taste of cumin/coriander/anise/whatever in, say, a chicken curry? I've read that tarragon apparently tastes *a bit* like dill, and that oregano has an earthy taste similar to cumin. Would some kind of ratio of those two give me *more-or-less* the same flavor profile as those cumin-esque spices? Any other herbs and spices that would be useful? Maybe even a synthetic flavoring extract used in cheap fast food that doesn't have any organic bits of the actual plant it imitates?\n\nI've done some curry recipes using a masala with every common spice *but* cumin and coriander, but while it *did* taste vaguely Indian, it was clear something was missing, so I don't know.\n\nEdit: Big thanks, everyone. A *lot* of really interesting, unconventional answers and thinking outside the box---didn't expect half this much.

{"title": "Grandmas toffee recipe keeps separating, need a large quantity for her memorial service- how do I fix this??", "selftext": "Update: SUCCESS!!! Thanks for all the tips everyone! I just did a batch this morning and it turned out perfect! Here\u2019s some [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/LQgCTSz).\n\nFor this batch I left all the ingredients out overnight so they were all 9000% the same temp. Then I melted the salted butter on low, added the brown sugar and stirred to dissolve. I turned the heat up just a little and slowly added the almonds. I gently stirred every now and then while it came up to temp (not scraping the bottom or sides of the pan), and tested for candy stage in cold water until sustained hard crack for 30 seconds.\n\nHere\u2019s the recipe if anyone wants to make it:\n\nGrandma D\u2019s Toffee\n\n\u20221/2 cup (one stick) salted butter\n\u20223/4 cup packed brown sugar\n\u20221 cup raw almonds\n\u20221/2 cup chocolate chips\n\u2022chopped walnuts\n\n1. Melt butter in heavy bottomed sauce pan over lowest heat, once melted add brown sugar and stir with wooden spoon to dissolve.\n2. Once dissolved, turn up heat just slightly and slowing start adding almonds by the handful. Add slowly over a few minutes, gently stirring.\n3. Once all almonds are added turn heat up slightly again, and stir gently every now and then as candy comes to temperature. Be careful not to scrape the sides or bottom of the pan with the spoon. \n4. As candy bubbles, start testing it for candy stage by dropping small amounts off the spoon into a small bowl of water. Once candy has reached the hard crack stage, wait 30 seconds, and then pour onto a cookie sheet and smooth out to the thickness of one almond.\n5. Once smoothed out, sprinkle with the chocolate chips, wait a bit for them to melt, then spread evenly over top of the toffee and sprinkle with chopped walnuts, pressing them into the chocolate gently.\n6. Wait for toffee to cool and chocolate to harden, then break into pieces and store in an airtight container.\n\nAs grandma would say, it\u2019s a snap!\n\n\nSo I\u2019m making my grandmas toffee recipe (which my family has made many times before, for decades, without issue) and it WILL NOT STOP SEPARATING.\n\nI\u2019m on my second batch (first one was a total dud) and it\u2019s started to separate more than 5 times but I\u2019ve been able to bring it back by adding some hot water and stirring vigorously.\n\nI have it on low heat, and it\u2019s been almost 30 mins and it\u2019s barely at the soft ball stage. When I try to turn the heat up even a little, it just separates.\n\nWhat do I do?!?! I was planning to make A LOT of this toffee today for my grandmas memorial service this weekend but it just won\u2019t work \ud83d\ude1e\n\nThe recipe is: 1/2 cup butter (I\u2019m suing unsalted, but we usually use salted), 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 cup almonds in a saucepan stirring constantly.\n\nHumidity is 34%, all ingredients are at room temp before starting.\n\nEdit: Tried batch 3, used a different pan, larger burner, used salted butter, and didn\u2019t add almonds at the beginning. Whisked the sugar and butter non-stop and it was beautiful and made it to hard crack, but when I went to add the almonds the sugar seized and the butter immediately separated. I added some hot water and it came back together, but I couldn\u2019t get it back to hard crack without it separating.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/pl5eer/grandmas_toffee_recipe_keeps_separating_need_a/", "created_utc": 1631217669.0, "score": 348, "author": "raisedglazed", "num_comments": 118, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/pl5eer/grandmas_toffee_recipe_keeps_separating_need_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "An Introduction to /r/AskCulinary", "selftext": "/r/AskCulinary has seen a lot of new subscribers over the last couple of months, so the mods thought it would be a good idea to go over what the sub is all about and how it works.\n\nThere is another sub for asking cooking questions, /r/Cooking, so a good place to start is asking what sets us apart. At first glance, you might think that we answer more sophisticated questions, or offer answers from just professional chefs, but those aren't really true. We're open to questions at all levels (so please stop downvoting the more basic ones!), and we have a lot of very knowledgeable home cooks here. \n\nThe real distinction we try to keep is specificity and expertise. Like it says in the sidebar, if you are looking for a variety of good answers, go to /r/Cooking; For the one right answer, come to /r/AskCulinary. /r/Cooking is best for brainstorming; /r/AskCulinary is best for solving the particular problem you've encountered. \n\n\n\nLet's look at some guidelines for questions:  \n\n1. The search bar and the FAQ are both woefully underused. Please give your question a quick search before asking. There\u2019s a good chance it has already been addressed already (especially if it pertains to cast iron, steak, or knife sharpening). Providing the same answers over and over again gets kind of dull don't you think?  \n\n2. If you\u2019re asking for help with a recipe or would like to tweak a recipe, please provide a link to the recipe. It\u2019s hard to give you advice if we don\u2019t know what you\u2019re already doing!  \n\n3. Equipment recommendations: Most of the time, these questions devolve into subjective suggestions rather than objective observations: \u201cI\u2019ve only used this brand, I\u2019ve never touched any of the others, but it works great, therefore I recommend it without having any knowledge of the other brands!\u201d Also, we have lots of detailed answers about popular equipment topics in our aforementioned woefully underused FAQ.  \n\n4. Food safety: General food safety questions are permitted, but specific questions concerning the specific dish that you left out on the counter for x hours, or if your chicken is still safe after it's been defrosting in the fridge for x days will generally be removed.  \n\n5. Recipe requests: Recipe requests are best served at /r/recipes or /r/cooking. In general, if you\u2019re looking for a lot of \u201ccorrect\u201d answers (like for a recipe request), /r/cooking is the place to go.  \n\n6. General discussion: Again, questions like \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite\u2026\u201d which feature many \u201ccorrect\u201d answers are better served over in /r/cooking. However, we feature one general discussion each week, so if you have an idea for a discussion topic, please send it our way.\n\n\n\nAnd here are some examples of good and not so good questions for /r/askculinary.\n\nBad questions:  \n\u2022 \u201cI accidentally left my bacon out for five hours! Is it still safe to eat?\u201d (Rule 4)  \n\n\u2022 \u201cGive me your favorite hash brown recipes!\u201d (Rule 5)  \n\n\u2022 \u201cDo Michelin starred restaurants ever use ketchup?\u201d (Rule 6)  \n\nGood questions:  \n\u2022 \u201cPlanning a multi-course romantic dinner. Critique my menu please?\"  \n\n\u2022 \u201cHow do I fix the cracks on my macarons?\u201d  \n\n\u2022 \u201cWhat kinds of modifications would I need to make if I used instant yeast instead of active dry in my bread recipe?\u201d  \n\n\u2022 \u201cHere\u2019s my falafel recipe. Why do they keep falling apart in the fryer?\u201d  \n\n\n\nGuidelines for answers:  \n\n1. Questions at all levels are welcome. Please be helpful when answering a question. Beginners never improve if they get downvotes and flaming instead of advice.\n\n2. Please keep answers pertinent to the question asked. For instance, telling OP that they should have used pork shoulder when they already have a pot of dry slow cooked pork loin is not of much help is it?

{"title": "Looked everywhere for a bakery job, please help.", "selftext": "Hi. I (23F)  have worked in the food industry for almost 2 years, but the closest to a bakery was a small German restaurant that I spent all most a year at. I worked as a line cook, but it was so small that we did different things every day. I worked in front, back, and the small bakery/delli/grocery area. \n I had done a 4 month training program for restaurant work, and tried to get an associate degree in pastry arts before covid hit and I had to drop out first semester.\n \nI have looked at every bakery in my area, even the ones in grocery stores, but no one is hiring, and given my resume to some if they need any seasonal work. I need a way to gain experience(and money), but my brother is so high risk that I can't get a job as a line cook, which I tend to default to, it's just not safe. Bakerys tend to have smaller staffs and less or no contact with customers when you work in the back.\n\n Please does anyone have anything I can do to help me find a job? Or even an internship. I have a ServSafe Manger certificate and experience with restaurant work. I have learned as much a I can without a real in person teacher about making bread, cakes, cookies, pastries, and decorating. But there is only so much I can do. \n\nI don't know where to go from here, my family had to move 40 minutes away by car from our last place, so even if it was safe to go back to college soon, I wouldn't be able to(I can't drive, I'm working on that) my family can't take me and public transport doesn't go between the 2 cities. \n\n I'm sorry for rambling, but I don't have anyone to ask. I have pictures of my work to show I'm serious, but it's already been a year and I just can't find anyone who would hire me. I'm getting anxious because I can't think of what to do, and it's really starting to get to me. \nSo please if you have any advice at all, what do I do?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for all the responses. I didn't expect the response to this to be so big. So here's some more details. \n\nI moved from Colorado Springs to one of the smaller cities around it. \n\nI unfortunately can't do a baking business from home, I live with my family. So it's my mom, stepdad, 13 year old brother, and my extremly disabled brother(15). The kitchen is always a busy area and can't reliably be a clean enough area for a business, we just do too much cooking to feed everyone(we try not to order out much, but can and do when needed). I hope anyone how has lived with a growing teenager can understand, he is already taller then me and eats so much it's ridiculous, so we always need to do dishes and other kitchen things.\n \nMy 15 year old brother has CMV, asthma, and other health problems. His brain stopped developing at 9 months and is so high risk that he has only left the house to 1)move to the new house 2) gone to doctors that we couldn't put off anymore. The doctor thing only happened in the last month. So the grand total of times he has left the house 7. (At least we have a good backyard.) Because of this any assistanced living or retirement homes are out too. If he gets covid, he dies. My family practicly decontaminates anyone that has been out side before we go into his room.\n\nAnd to top off all this I have an official diagnosis for anxiety and clinical depression. My new meds have really help me out though. So I feel ready to try to work again.\n\nThank you again for all of this. I really don't know if I can respond to everyone personally, but I'll try. Sorry for any spelling errors, I'm dyslexic and somethings can get past spell check and text to speech. \n\nFINAL UPDATE: I talked it over with my mom and we decided to try to cottage food route. I'm already ServSafe Mangers Certified, so all we have to do is deep cleaning the kitchen, register with the state/county, and go to a restaurant supply store. My mom has worked in marketing and supply for companies before. So we have have a good idea for a start, so thank you all so much for all the comments. It's not exactly what I had in mind when I made this post, but it's something to do until covid finally starts to die. If nothing else, it will look good on my resume. \n\nThanks again to everyone who took the time to comment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/kpgf6p/looked_everywhere_for_a_bakery_job_please_help/", "created_utc": 1609659588.0, "score": 339, "author": "PlanetaryParadox", "num_comments": 76, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/kpgf6p/looked_everywhere_for_a_bakery_job_please_help/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Rules Post for /r/Askculinary", "selftext": "WELCOME! It's been a while since we've talked about the rules. Our readership includes cooks of all skill levels, from pro chefs to total beginners, and it's wonderful to see everyone coming together to help each other out. The group of volunteers that comprises the mod team thought it was a good time to post a refresher on our rules. \n\nThis sub occupies a niche space on Reddit, where experienced cooks help solve specific problems with recipes, ingredients, and equipment, and provide other troubleshooting solutions to the users. We differentiate ourselves from subs like [/r/Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking) and [/r/food](https://www.reddit.com/r/food), which are more wide-ranging discussion and sharing subs, in that we are primarily dedicated to answers specific questions about specific problems. Questions with many potential answers belong in [/r/Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking) or a specialty sub - e.g. \"What should I cook tonight?\" or, \"What should I do with this rutabaga?\", or \"What's the best knife?\" Questions with a single correct answer belong here - e.g., \"What makes my eggs turn rubbery in the oven?\" or, \"Is the vegetable in this picture a rutabaga?\"\n\nWe have found that our rules help our sub stay focused. Generalized subs are great for general discussion, but we're trying to preserve a little bit of a unique identity, and our rules are our best effort to do that.\n\nThis thread is the space to discuss our rules, or please feel free to message the mods. Please let us know how you think we can make [r/askculinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/askculinary) better. We don't claim to be perfect. We're trying to make a positive, helpful community.\n\nPOSTING:\n\nWe're best at:\n\nTroubleshooting dishes/menus\n\nEquipment troubleshooting questions (not brand requests)\n\nTechnique questions\n\nFood science\n\nPlease Keep Questions:\n\nSpecific (Have a goal in mind!)\n\nDetailed (Include the recipe, pictures, etc.)\n\nOn topic\n\nThis will ensure you get the best answers.\n\nHere's how to help us help you:\n\nPROVIDE AS MUCH INFO AS YOU CAN. We can't help you if you don't tell us what you've already done first. Please provide the recipe you're working from and tell us what went wrong with it or what you'd like to improve about it. \"I've tried everything\" isn't specific enough. If you're following a video recipe, consider putting a timestamp at the relevant portion of the video or writing out the recipe in text form.\n\nNO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF FOOD SAFETY. Food safety is one area where we cannot and will not answer a specific question, because we can't tell you anything about the specific pot of soup you left out overnight, and whether it is safe to eat. We will tell you about food safety best practices, but we only want answers from people actual knowledge. \"I've always done \\[thing\\] and I'm still OK\" is not an acceptable answer, for the same reason \"I never wear a seatbelt and I'm still here\" is not an acceptable answer. For specific situations we recommend you consult government food safety guidelines for your area and when in doubt, throw it out.\n\nNO RECIPE REQUESTS. If you have a recipe you'd like help adjusting or troubleshooting, we'd love to help you! But [r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is not in the business of providing recipes. There are tons of other subreddits that can help you with that.\n\nNO BRAINSTORMING. We do make exceptions for mass quantities and unusual ingredients (real past examples: wheelbarrow full of walnuts; nearly 400 ounces of canned tuna; 50 lbs of whole chicken), but \"What do I do with my last three limes?\" or \"What should I serve with this pork loin?\" should go to [r/Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking).\n\nNO BRAND RECOMMENDATIONS or \"What piece of equipment should I get?\" posts. It's very rare that one person has enough experience with multiple brands or models of a particular item to provide an objective response. We suggest you consult sources like Consumer Reports, the wirecutter, Serious Eats, or the like.\n\nNO GENERAL DISCUSSION. [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is modeled after [/r/AskScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScience) and [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians), not [/r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit).

If you have a discussion question that you think people would find interesting or engaging, please send a modmail so we can add it to our list of discussion questions.\n\nNO SURVEYS. If you think your survey might be a good fit for this community, please send a modmail first so the team can determine if our subreddit or a different one would be more appropriate, but as a rule, we do not allow surveys. \n\nNO SELF-PROMOTION OR CONTENT LINKS. We're a place to help cooks get better, not to share your content or other promotional-type posts (even if they're not your own content). If you're interested in an AMA, message the mods. \n\nCOMMENTING:\n\nBE NICE TO EACH OTHER. Politeness is not optional at [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary). We're all here to help each other learn new things and succeed in the kitchen.\n\nTOP LEVEL COMMENTS MUST ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. Saying \"oh hey, I always wondered that too!\" or \"try it and let us know!\" doesn't help OP. Comments asking for more information and comments made in good faith that don't directly address OP's exact question but provide an alternate solution are OK.\n\nNO LINKS WITHOUT EXPLANATION. The reason people come to [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is because the people who answer questions here are real people with real kitchen advice. If you find a good source that answers OP's question, please provide it! But also provide at least a little bit of extra information so OP knows what they're clicking on and what to expect.\n\nSTAY ON SUBJECT. Posts here present questions to be answered, not prompts for a general subjects of discussion. If a post does spark a question for you, please ask it in a separate post (in [r/Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking) or a specialty sub if it doesn't fit the requirements above). Likewise, no jokes: we're trying to be helpful. To that end, when a post has been answered and turns into general discussion about other stuff, we lock those threads. \n\nFAQs: See our Ingredient, Equipment, and Food Life FAQs to find answers on common topics like caring for cast iron and whether you should go to culinary school or not.

Specifically, when cooking  aglieo e olio you need starchy water to get the oil to emulsify AND you need to finish the pasta with the sauce.  So two problems - First, how to get enough starch into the water without over cooking the fresh pasta.  Two, how to finish the pasta in the sauce, again without over cooking it.\n\nOver the weekend I took another shot at this dish with one change from the traditional method - cornstarch.  I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to the pasta water prior to cooking the pasta.  It worked great, nice starchy water.  The water made a fantastic emulsified sauce.\n\nPasta was still a little over cooked as the starchy water cooked down and formed the emulsified sauce.  Since my fresh pasta only takes about 90 seconds to cook I think I will try a couple of other options.  First - cut the pasta thicker.  This will give a longer cook time.  Second - I might skip the boil all together and cook the pasta directly in the sauce as it emulsifies.  \n\nHope you find this helpful - happy cooking.

{"title": "What is different about Kewpie mayo, chemically speaking, that makes it so creamy/spreadable? It can't be just the yolk density.", "selftext": "So for a bit of background as to why I care - I have a soy protein intolerance. I cannot tolerate the soybean oil used in Kewpie - which is problematic for me, primarily because the use cases for Kewpie are more broad and diverse than western mayo. \n\nWhat I mean is, you aren't out of place throwing down a few thin stripes of kewpie over a rice or noodle bowl, whereas trying something like that with American mayo is an exercise in futility. Even if I were to take American mayo and stuff it into a kewpie bottle, it would sputter and spurt and not come out in perfect, thin ribbons the way Kewpie does.\n\nI've tried to make my own mayo, and leaned heavier into the egg yolks (and added MSG of course) in an attempt to mimic what Kewpie is doing, but even doing so, I don't wind up with a texture (or flavor for that matter) conducive to rice bowls and noodle bowls. \n\nThis process is driving me crazy, which is leading me to believe I'm missing some element of what they're doing. Some people have said they use dashi stock in theirs, but that doesn't track with the ingredients labels I've seen.\n\n\nThe other reason I believe there's something chemically different about Kewpie is due to the way it reacts in water - well, more specifically, *broth*. A popular ramen hack involved putting some kewpie in the bowl before adding the broth to turn the broth creamy. Kewpie does this without fail - but if you try it with American mayo it instead sort of \"shreds\" into these little white mayo particles that will not emulsify in no matter what you do.\n\nI thought maybe the broth was scrambling the mayo before it could separate, but even adding it in slowly, and stirring vigorously, it just wouldn't behave. By contrast, I have no such issues emulsifying an egg yolk into broth - so I don't think it's technique here. And Kewpie, of course, just *works* and doesn't scramble at all.

{"title": "Welcome to /r/AskCulinary! PLEASE READ!", "selftext": "WELCOME! [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) recently hit 250K subscribers! We're thrilled that so many others find this community as informative and entertaining as we do. Our readership includes cooks of all skill levels, from pro chefs to total beginners, and it's wonderful to see everyone coming together to help each other out.\n\nSince our corner of reddit is growing, the mod team thought it was a good time to post a refresher on our rules:\n\n# POSTING:\n\n1. **NO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF FOOD SAFETY.** We can't tell you anything about the specific packet of chicken or pot of soup you left out overnight. General questions about good food safety practices are allowed, but for specific situations we recommend you consult government food safety guidelines for your area and when in doubt, throw it out.\n2. **PROVIDE AS MUCH INFO AS YOU CAN.** We can't help you if you don't tell us what you've already done first. Please provide the recipe you're working from and tell us what went wrong with it or what you'd like to improve about it. \"I've tried everything\" isn't specific enough. If you're following a video recipe, consider putting a timestamp at the relevant portion of the video or writing out the recipe in text form.\n3. **NO RECIPE REQUESTS.** If you have a recipe you'd like help adjusting or troubleshooting, we'd love to help you! But [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is not in the business of providing recipes. There are [tons of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/wiki/relatedsubs) that can help you with that.\n4. **NO BRAINSTORMING.** We do make exceptions for mass quantities (real past examples: wheelbarrow full of walnuts; nearly 400 ounces of canned tuna; 50 lbs of whole chicken), but \"What do I do with my last three limes?\" or \"What should I serve with this pork loin?\" should go to [/r/cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/cooking). We also make exceptions for rare or unusual ingredients that [/r/cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/cooking) might not have the expertise to handle.\n5. **NO BRAND RECOMMENDATIONS** or \"What piece of equipment should I get?\" posts. It's very rare that one person has enough experience with multiple brands or models of a particular item to provide an objective response. We suggest you consult sources like Consumer Reports.\n6. **NO GENERAL DISCUSSION.** [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is modeled after [/r/AskScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScience) and [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians), not [/r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit). Community discussions are reserved for our weekly stickied posts. If you have a discussion question that you think people would find interesting or engaging, please [**send a modmail**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskCulinary) so we can add it to our list of discussion questions.\n7. **NO SURVEYS.** If you think your survey might be a good fit for this community, please send a modmail first so the team can determine if our subreddit or a different one would be more appropriate.\n8. **DON'T COME HERE JUST TO PICK A FIGHT.** This isn't [/r/DebateCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCulinary). We can tell if you came here just to argue with people, and we will remove your post on the grounds that the question was asked in bad faith.\n\n# COMMENTING:\n\n1. **BE NICE TO EACH OTHER.** Politeness is not optional at [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary). We're all here to help each other learn new things and succeed in the kitchen.\n2. **TOP LEVEL COMMENTS MUST ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.** Saying \"oh hey, I always wondered that too!\" or \"try it and let us know!\" doesn't help OP. Comments asking for more information and comments made in good faith that don't *directly* address OP's *exact* question but provide an alternate solution are OK.\n3. **NO LINKS WITHOUT EXPLANATION.** The reason people come to [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is because the people who answer questions here are real people with real kitchen advice. If you find a good source that answers OP's question, please provide it! But also provide at least a little bit of extra information so OP knows what they're clicking on and what to expect.\n4. **NO JOKES.** We're here to help OP. If OP comes back to their post and finds a dick joke about sausages instead of a helpful answer, they're going to be disappointed. Remember that our main goal is to be helpful.\n\n**FULL COMMENT ETIQUETTE POLICY:** Comments should be factual, helpful, thorough, and respectful. When commenting avoid abuse, jokes, chatter, speculation, and especially links without explanation.\n\n**FAQs:** See our [Ingredient, Equipment, and Food Life FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/wiki/faq) to find answers on common topics like caring for cast iron and whether you should go to culinary school or not.\n\nLastly, please use the report button to let moderators know about posts or comments that violate one of the above rules! We spend a lot of time here but we can't catch everything on our own. We depend on you guys to help us keep bots, antagonistic weirdos, and habitual rule-breakers away.\n\nIf you have any questions about the above rules or thoughts on the community reaching this milestone, please leave a comment below!\n\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE for making [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) such a fantastic place!

Together they might create a dough that doesn't hold together well when mechanically agitated, thus creating those little bits of tempura-like batter that fly around when the dough starts frying, creating the honeycomb.\n\n\\-I've also seen someone do this with celery root, so maybe it's not due to the taro itself but rather overall moisture content + wheat starch\n\n\\-part of the starch is gelatinized as they pour boiling water into the starch. Does this help create the honeycomb?\n\n\\-something about the low temperature of the frying oil seems to be important as I've seen many chefs mention it in other videos.

Maybe another way to save it?

Is the shelf-life an issue of being \"fresh\", or the pigments falling out of solution?\n\n5. For a mostly-water based liquid, would adding an emulsifier like soy lecithin allow it to be used?

Any advice on how to go about it?\n\nThank you, I am a novice to cooking lamb!\n\nEdit adding recipe\nBook\n\n\n\nJournal\nrecipes\nLamb Raan\n\nLamb Raan\nAn ideal centrepiece recipe for dinner parties and family celebrations.\n\nPrep: 30 minutes\n\nTotal: 4.5 hours\n\n\nStory\nIngredients\nMethod\n\nChef Naved is delighted to share the secrets of his Lamb Raan. A wonderful dish of tender, slow-cooked raan (leg), pulled into silky shreds and combined with a deliciously savoury masala.\n\nLamb Raan makes a most satisfying centrepiece (especially for Eid). Some preparation is required (including a 24-hour marination, if time allows), but your efforts will be very well rewarded. We heartily recommend serving alongside gunpowder potatoes, a bowl of greens and naan.\n\nIf you are fortunate to have any leftovers, pile into soft pillowy bread buns and garnish with slaw, gherkins, baby spinach and fried green chillies to make our popular lamb raan buns.\n\nIngredients\n4 servings\n\n\n\n\nFor the lamb\n\n0.5 leg of lamb on the bone, 1.2\u20131.4kg\n\n\n2 tsp fine sea salt\n\n\n1.25 tsp deggi mirch chilli powder\n\n\n35 g garlic\n\n\n30 g fresh root ginger\n\n\n1 bay leaf\n\n\n4 cloves\n\n\n16 black peppercorns\n\n\n2 cinnamon sticks\n\n\n6 green cardamom pods\n\n\n3 black cardamom pods\n\n\n75 ml malt vinegar\n\n\n\nTo assemble\n\nMETHOD\n\nStep 1\nPlace the lamb in a dish. Mix the salt and chilli powder together and rub the mixture all over the lamb. Leave to marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\nStep 2\nGrate the garlic and ginger using a microplane, or grind to a fine paste using a pestle and mortar. When the 30 minutes is up, rub the garlic and ginger paste all over the lamb. Cover and refrigerate for 12\u201324 hours.\n\nStep 3\nTake the lamb out of the fridge 5 hours before you want to eat and leave it at room temperature for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 180\u00b0C/Fan 160\u00b0C/Gas 4.\n\nStep 4\nPlace the lamb joint in a deep casserole pot (that has a lid). Add the bay leaf, spices and vinegar and pour in enough water to come at least halfway up the meat (around 300ml). Put the lid on and place the pot into the oven. Roast for 4 hours, turning the joint over every hour, basting regularly and topping up the water if the level goes below a third of the way up the lamb.\n\nStep 5\nOnce cooked, remove the lamb from the oven and leave it to rest in its cooking liquor for 20\u201330 minutes. Preheat the grill to high.\n\nStep 6\nPour the cooking liquor through a sieve into a measuring jug; discard the residue in the sieve. Working in the dish, pull the meat from the bone; set the bon aside. Shred the meat using two forks or your hands. Add 120ml of the reserved cooking liquor, the butter and 2 tsp kabab masala. Mix, taste, and add a little more cooking liquor, lime juice or kabab masala as you wish.\n\nStep 7\nPlace the reserved bone in a flameproof serving dish and pile the meat on and around it, so that it resembles a joint. Place under the hot grill for 4\u20135 minutes to create a few crispy bits on top.\n\nStep 8\nBring the lamb raan to the table in the dish. \nHave lime wedges and a dish of extra kabab masala\n on the table for guests to add more if they wish.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1k2uwfn/how_to_go_about_cooking_changing_this_lamb_raan/", "created_utc": 1745064882.0, "score": 2, "author": "hebejebee", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1k2uwfn/how_to_go_about_cooking_changing_this_lamb_raan/", "html_title": ""}

In my journey of trying to cope with the loss of a lot of convenience products I've started trying some new stuff. I'm usually a fan of filled wraps. Corn tortillas aren't available where I live but surprisingly corn flour is.\nSo I've tried following a recipe online which recommended a 1 cup to 1 cup ratio of water to corn flour. That was rather...liquidy. I added some more flour to get it to be a \"dough\" consistency. Whilst it was a tiny bit crumbly, I felt like it balled up nicely.\nObviously I hadn't purchased a tortilla press for my first trime trying this so I used a glass bottle and some parchment paper. This worked surprisingly well and even transferring the tortillas worked well.\nI baked them in a very hot pan without oil until each side had some browning.\nIn my opinion they turned out rather stiff and not what I expected them to be like. I experimented a bit with thickness and cooking time but didn't get them quite the way I expected.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips and tricks for what went wrong? Or is this the desired texture?

If I instead use egg yolks and oil, the sauce is fine even after re-heating. Lard seems to have the same result as butter.\n\nHere's the Hollandaise I fucked up last night: 2 yolks, 3 tbsp water, half a lemon for zest+juice, mix until creamy, add 300g browned butter slowly during constant mixing, then add salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper. You know how after you brown butter, there's some sweet, delicious, sugar-like stuff at the bottom? I had added all the butter and decided to add that bottom stuff as well, mixed, and suddenly the sauce was watery instead of thick and creamy. Soon the sauce looked completely de-emulsified.\n\nI don't know if the addition of that solid bottom stuff somehow disturbed the emulsion, or if the mixture was already unstable for some reason and had to de-emulsify as soon as the mixing stopped, or if I hadn't noticed the sauce becoming more watery over time. Does browning butter (or over-browning as I think I did) make emulsification more difficult? Is the ratio of egg to butter too low? I previously made bearnaise with 2 yolks and 175g butter, and it was good when fresh but not when re-heated. Is there some other ingredient I can add to stabilize the sauce not only when fresh but when re-heated?

I\u2019m working on a new one-shot cooking method that combines dum-style flavor with modern time-saving tools \u2014 and I\u2019d love thoughts from experienced cooks.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d The concept in short:\n\nI\u2019m experimenting with cooking marinated goat meat (mutton) \u2014 with yogurt, turmeric, lemon juice, salt, chili powder, pepper, and (in future) raw papaya \u2014 all wrapped in muslin cloth, and placing this inside a rice cooker along with raw rice and water.\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\n* The rice boils/cooks at the bottom\n* The meat cooks on top, either through direct steaming, semi-boiling, or light pressure from the cooker\u2019s moisture\n* The whole thing happens in one device, without using a pressure cooker or pan, aiming for a quick version of dum cooking\n\n**\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Why I\u2019m Doing This:**\n\nOver the past week, I\u2019ve been testing out a method where I **used banana leaves to wrap dishes** and place them on top of rice in the cooker. I started with a **paneer-based gravy** that I cooked separately, and then layered it over **methi, palak, and starchy veggies** like sweet potato and banana (with peas directly in rice). I wrapped all of that in banana leaf and placed it in the rice cooker.\n\nIt worked surprisingly well and tasted great \u2014 but I used **store-bought banana leaves**, and after consuming dishes like this 4+ times in the last 7 days, I began feeling a bit off. I **suspect chemical residue on the leaves**, so I decided to **pause using banana leaves for safety**.\n\nBut right when I stopped, I also had a **great success with mutton cooked inside a banana leaf** that same way \u2014 it came out soft, juicy, well-done. I didn\u2019t want to drop the technique just because I had to stop using banana leaves. So now I\u2019m continuing the concept by replacing the leaf with **muslin cloth**, which feels safer, reusable, and more stable.\n\nAlso \u2014 I\u2019m doing this because I want a **fast, efficient way to cook meat and rice together** in one go without losing on taste or nutrition. In a busy schedule, this would be a game-changer for me.\n\n\n\n# \ud83e\udd63 My Method:\n\n* **Meat**: Boneless goat meat (from typically harder cuts), chopped into **very small pieces** (smaller than usual bite-sized) to help with faster cooking.\n* **Marinade**:\n   * Yogurt\n   * Lemon juice\n   * Salt\n   * Black pepper\n   * Indian chili powder\n   * **Turmeric powder**\n   * *(Raw papaya will be added in the next trial to help tenderize naturally.)*\n* **Preparation**:\n   * Meat + onions + some spices + optional veggies are wrapped in **muslin cloth**, pouch-style.\n   * Not making a full gravy \u2014 just **semi-gravy or veggie-spiced** flavor pockets.\n* **Cooking**:\n   * Rice: 100g raw rice + 2x water in electric rice cooker.\n   * Pouch: placed **inside the same cooker**, either:\n      1. Directly on the rice\n      2. Suspended above on a rack/stand\n      3. Floating or partially submerged\n   * Cooker runs on its default cycle \u2014 no extra steaming time added.\n\n# \u2753 What I Want to Know:\n\n1. **Can the meat really cook in the time it takes for rice to cook (electric cooker time)?**\n2. **What\u2019s the ideal placement of the muslin pouch?**\n   * Direct contact with rice?\n   * Floating?\n   * Suspended above rice (rack/stand)?\n3. If the **muslin pouch touches the walls/surface of the rice cooker directly**, is that okay? Or does it affect safety/heat distribution?\n4. Will **raw papaya paste** in the marinade *really* make a difference in such short cooking time?\n5. Are there **nutritional benefits** to this technique (e.g., slow steam + moisture retention vs pressure/boiling)?\n6. This doesn\u2019t seem common \u2014 is this method used in any cuisine or am I creating something totally new?\n7. Why isn\u2019t **muslin cloth** used more commonly in this type of cooking?\n8. What are some potential **risks I might be missing** \u2014 texture, over/undercooking, flavor loss?\n\n\ud83d\ude4f I\u2019m not waiting for the perfect answer to start \u2014 I\u2019m already experimenting \u2014 but I\u2019d love your insights so I can improve and understand this more deeply.

{"title": "Braised Brisket STILL Too Tough", "selftext": "\nHi all. I braise brisket Jewish style (meat, onions, some liquid, etc.) every Passover and never have issues. This year I seared the beef as usual, preheated the oven to 350, trimmed meat in with onions as always, but I added too much liquid. (No idea why, I was anxious, it just happened.) I lowered the temp to 225 and hunkered down for the cook.After about 2 to 3 hours cooking time, I rotated the pans and removed a LOT of excess water, so about 1/2 to 1/3 of the beef was out of the water. Raised the temp to 250 and put it back in the oven. (I started brisket around 5:30 pm, FYI.) I went to bed and brisket was still cooking. I woke up at 4 and the oven had turned off during the night (no idea when) but it was still warm in the oven. The meat was tough. I turned the temp up to 300 and put it back in. That was at 5 am. It's now 8:20 am and this is where we are. One piece (the flat) is starting to come along nicely and get more tender. The others are still pretty tough. \n\nMy question is, did I ruin it by using too much liquid for those first 2-3 hours? Is it just I cooked it for so long at the lower temp (without knowing how many hours it was off) that more progress hasnt been made? Is this still going to work out or do I need to scrap and start again?\n\nI started with a very large whole brisket from Costco (about $100) trimmed and cut into a few pieces.

{"title": "How do I alleviate my tomato sauce: case in point Penne Arrabbiata", "selftext": "Like most people I always enjoyed tomato sauces and pasta at home and at local restaurants. However, when I started eating at Italian restaurants and 5 star international hotels I was introduced to tomato sauces like nothing before.\n\nMany of the dishes had the same names and description but tasted so different, as if they were different food altogether. I reckon top restaurants and hotels have access to the best chefs and ingredients, but no matter how much I tried to narrow my focus I could never replicate the same taste.\n\nCase in point is Penne Arrabbiata, a very simple tomato sauce. I read every recipe and watched every YouTube video but just could not perfect it.\n\nThe recipe I use:\n\n* 1 can 400g (14oz) whole peeled tomatoes in thick tomato juice\n* 2 small garlic cloves\n* 2 tbls extra virgin olive oil\n* 1tsp crushed chili\n* 1tsp salt\n* 1/4tsp sugar\n* 1/8tsp baking soda\n\nThe process I follow:\n\n* Crush garlic to very fine and saute in olive oil over low heat stirring gently until they just give off all of their smell and turn golden and slightly crispy (no brown color).\n* Add tomatoes, crushed chili, salt, sugar, and baking soda\n* Raise the heat and stir regularly until bubbling and then reduce the heat and let the sauce reduce for 15 minutes until thick enough for the pasta.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe sauce I get is decent but nowhere near the best restaurants. Why? Could it be the canned tomatoes I am using? They do have a lot of citric acid, but so do the cans restaurants use, right?\n\nA lot of online posts suggest countering acidity by adding carrots, onions, milk/cream, and tomato paste.

{"title": "Milk washing tea to go in desserts?", "selftext": "Hi! I'm having some trouble choosing the technique to use in a dessert. I'm planning on making white chocolate bonbons and filling them with a yuzu and jasmine tea white chocolate ganache (I'm using Jasmine Bai Hao - although, admittedly, it's not at its freshest, which is why I'm using it for baking instead of drinking it). \nI've made a few attempts of brewing the tea strong enough so it could properly flavor the ganache. However, even if I do it at the correct temperature for this type of tea (85\u00b0C) and not for longer than 3 minutes, the huge amount of leaves it takes to get more flavor still makes it taste bitter. So I thought perhaps I could make use of a common technique used in cocktails: milk washing. I'd brew the jasmine tea the same way, but add milk and yuzu juice until it curdles, then strain the mixture and use that for my ganache. Question is: is that the best way to impart the tea flavor to the ganache? Would it have the same result if I just boiled the tea in heavy cream and used that (+ yuzu peels) instead? I know milk mellows out tannins, so in theory both things should yield a similar result, no? \nWhat do you think? Is there some other option I'm not thinking of? Thank you!

{"title": "Help with overproofed/overinflated pizza dough", "selftext": "I work for a restaurant and have to make pizzas daily. I've been here for almost two months now and I feel like the pizzas that I make if the dough is straight off the walk-in chiller is perfect. I have no problem stretching them and it's very rare that I even puncture them. But I've had a problem since I started and it's still a problem now: over inflated doughs. We have proofing boxes for our pizza dough, and each box have about 10 - 12 doughs in them. When we have an order, we take out a box, make the order, and leave the box in room temp. Now this usually results in some dough not being used for quite some time, and [triples in size](https://eu-central.storage.cloudconvert.com/tasks/368d13bd-1c22-4eb5-9ff6-9cfb32c4c7f1/dough-over-proving.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=cloudconvert-production%2F20250411%2Ffra%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250411T221222Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=51e35c9c07b47f04e7914af704af12a312c0c4294bf797e328ec2fc61ae0825f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D\"dough-over-proving.png\"&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&x-id=GetObject).\n\nI can do ones that double in size no problem. I've tried working the ones that tripled in size and all attempts have lead to multiple small holes in the dough and the crust being unbelievably thick. I thought that we can just use these over-proofed dough as a poolish (as a co-worker told me before) so I just get another tray from the chiller to use. Been doing that for around two weeks now and haven't had a problem until yesterday.\n\nNow yesterday, my only male co-worker go off on me saying \"these pizza doughs are still good to be baked, I had to sac two trays yesterday (it was my day-off btw) These doughs are not easy to make :/\". (rough translation, hard to get a direct one) From what I can tell from my other co-workers they actually have trouble working these doughs that was basically left for around 5-6 hours on room temp. It was also my first time hearing that there was a problem with what I've been doing. He also explained that I should \"just be careful\" with those types of dough. But that's what I've been trying to do, I've taken so much time with the same results. \n\nSo I have a couple of questions:\n\n1) First thing that came to mind was that maybe I should just put back the tray back in the chiller after an order. Is there no problem with doing that?\n\n2) If I cannot put the tray back, is there a foolproof way that I can work those triple-size dough because just \"being careful\" doesn't seem to be working for me? The internet is not helping me with my search and all results have just been about working a normal-sized dough, which I have no problem doing.\n\n3) The closest answer I've seen to help is \"punching the dough down\". Can somebody explain this to me because I've only seen [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEThHBo6x6U) about it, and it was vague. How long before I have to use the dough again do I have to punch it down? Is it even something that can work in this situation?\n\n4) Is there something else I'm missing?\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jx28ik/help_with_overproofedoverinflated_pizza_dough/", "created_utc": 1744409890.0, "score": 2, "author": "Aerinn_May", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jx28ik/help_with_overproofedoverinflated_pizza_dough/", "html_title": ""}

It seems that the majority of you feel that we are locking posts too quickly before good answers can be given.  Our thought process has always been that we wanted to drive engagement toward new unanswered posts and so we lock posts that we felt have been fully answered to help drive that engagement.  You all brought up some good points about our bias toward US time zones, and how we're too quick to lock posts that could have different answers and how we don't really give anyone outside US time zones a chance to comment. So to that end we have decided to try something a bit different.  We will no longer lock post manually and instead we will let posts go for 48 hours before they're automatically locked.\n\n This is a new process for us and we're still feeling it out and welcome any feedback on the rule change here.  Our goal with this sub has always been to have a place users could go to get troubleshooting help for things they are trying to cook.  This makes it so that relevant quick answers are the most useful to people asking questions.  We've tried to help promote engagement on less popular new posts by locking threads that are popular but have run their course and started to devolve into open discussions.  While these may be fun and interesting they are the antithesis of what we are trying to accomplish here.

Also it calls for chopped onions and mine were probably a little more diced than chopped.  \n* Recipe #1 I have never left any ingredients out, it calls for a 3-4lb roast and I likely used one that was 3lbs or less.\n* Recipe #2 calls for potatoes which I omitted and my roast was only 2.5lbs when the recipe calls for 3-5lbs.  \n* Both recipes call for a similar amount of meat but #1 has 3 cups of liqiud and #2 calls for 4 cups of liquid.\n* Recipe #1 cooks for 1 hour 20 minutes and recipe #2 recommends 1 hour for a 3lb roast (which I did since mine was 2.5lbs).  \n\nWhat made recipe #2 so tough and disappointing?  Was it the meat altitude? The onion raft? The omission of potatoes?  Is red wine magic?  Did I actually not cook it long enough - I thought if meat was tough it always meant you overcooked it?!

{"title": "A couple of questions about making chicken strips.", "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI recently had a craving for buffalo sauce and came up with an idea to modify a family recipe to satiate this craving. The family recipe is what we call \"world famous chicken\" which is in essence chicken fryer pieces breaded with potato buds, melted butter poured on top and baked (in recent years as the industrial process of making potato buds has changed we've cut them with panko to keep the crisp up). It's great I love it, but I have some ideas to change it to both incorporate the buffalo sauce and make it more friendly for meal prep. \n\nMy idea is to cut the chicken into chicken strips, marinade in a combination of Frank's red hot and buttermilk, bread them with a flour, egg wash, potato bud breading, than either shallow fry or bake. \n\nSo my questions are as such: \n\n1. What is the best way to cut chicken into strips? My brain says breasts (and I have a butcher I can get good quality from) but if you know of ways to cut thighs into strips I'd love to hear that too.\n\n2. In an effort to get more uniform browning I'm thinking of adding butter powder to the last dredge step then spraying the strips with neutral oil before cooking. Are there any concerns with using powdered butter in a dredge in this manner? Any ideas about how much to use? It's a new ingredient to me that I've honestly been trying to find a reason to use it and I might be forcing it in this situation\n\n3. Shallow fry or bake? If I were to shallow fry I'd likely skip spraying them with oil, if I bake I'm thinking spray, but my concern is that the potato flakes would be liable to burn in a shallow fry, but some charring is delicious so any input is welcome\n\nI see that I'm getting a warning for using the term \"best\" but I hope this passes scrutiny because I'm not sure r/cooking would take these questions. \n\nThank you all in advance,\n\nHappy cooking!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jpcri6/a_couple_of_questions_about_making_chicken_strips/", "created_utc": 1743557549.0, "score": 8, "author": "milleribsen", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jpcri6/a_couple_of_questions_about_making_chicken_strips/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Soft tofu", "selftext": "I\u2019m doing something wrong. I used Mary\u2019s test kitchen tofu method. I tried twice. The first time I had my soybeans in water in fridge for bout 13 hours. And then I blended it with water as per \u201chttps://www.marystestkitchen.com/diy-silken-tofu-soy-beans-lemon-juice/\u201c . Than I had 3 milk bags combined and squeezed as much as I could, and than transferred to a pot where I did high heat and it boiled over so I was left with 3 cups of milk instead of 5 as in beginning. And I let that milk simmer for 10 mins. And than I let it cool to warm and I used 3 1/4 teaspoons of gypsum food grade and mixed it really well and I stuck in my aroma steamer as it warmed up and 10 mins to cook in, also I didn\u2019t put any plastic wrap, it was open. After it beeped as in done steaming, I opened it and the liquid was yellowish clear, and all the tofu was in the middle look crumbly. As if I used lemon in her video. So I took it out and left it alone to cool cause it\u2019s my first time and I thought maybe it still needs to cool. And it still was the same and went I cut through it looked like scrambled eggs. So I left it in the fridge and started in my next try. So my 2nd try. I left my beans on counter for about 8 hours to speed it up. And then I blended it new water and for about 3 mins in a very high powered blender but half a cup less because maybe it was too much water. And then I squeezed everything into a pot through 3 milk bags again. And this time I set it high and stirred frequently as before but watched carefully and as soon as it started to bubble and rise a bit, I took it off the stove and set the top to simmer and set back my pot for 10 mins and stirred regularly but not as frequently. Then I let it cool and stuck it into a fridge until became cold to touch, cause last time I did warm. Then I separated the milks. This time instead of mixing everything in one big jar, I had a glass cup where I poured abit milk of the 1 cup I was going to use, and I had a ceramic cup where I poured some milk. And left some in pan in fridge in case this gets screwed up. Then for glass I mixed in 1/4 teaspoon and an extra pinch to gypsum cause maybe not enough in first round and for ceramic I used the 1/4 teaspoon for each. And I poured the rest of cup of milk to each ceramic without stirring like Mary\u2019s video and set them into the aroma steamer opened. Then as I was going to pour the rest of cup milk in the glass cup, I realized my Soymilk became solid but very soft and jiggly and I thought maybe that\u2019s it, and that is my tofu, but it wasn\u2019t even heated, and it wasn\u2019t even the whole cup of milk so it would mean my soft tofu and the gypsum is out of balance and probably won\u2019t taste good as too much gypsum. So I had a small tray and I tried to get the bit of solidified tofu into the tray and it wouldn\u2019t come out until I smacked the glass a few times and it fell in chunks into the tray and looked fairly smooth and I added the rest of the soy milk to equal 1 cup in total into the tray. And this time I let the aroma steamer heat up before the 10 mins timer count down because maybe I was suppose to let it heat up. And I set it into the steamer uncovered again because her videos shown all jars uncovered. And I did it for all 3 containers. The tray with the tofu that looked soft in the glass jar before I added more milk. After it cooled, half of the round tray was solid and the other half was pure liquid like white but diluted. Like Soymilk with condensation. The other half with solids is because I had chunks of it I smacked in there and they grew a little bit bigger but they no longer soft looking but looked crumbly. And the other 2. Had bubbly looking on top. And were yellow yellow liquids, and looked like example she gave in the last part of the video claiming why store bought milk is not a good idea. And 1 tray lowkey looked like her last example of almond milk if tried with gypsum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used food grade gypsum!\n\nLater I cooked it for longer and realized I could make firm tofu and made firm tofu with it after pressing and all. \n\nMy goal was silken soft tofu or soon tofu or even very soft silken tofu. All I want is soft tofu just soft and smooth and yummy. \n\nSo I did bunch of research and watch videos of others \n1. Was I supposed to use the plastic wraps before putting into steamer?\n2.

Should I used the GDL method instead and go buy GDL?\n5. Was I supposed to mix it throughly instead ?\n6.

{"title": "Store pepper grinder in fridge?", "selftext": "I don't normally use spices but would like to start using black pepper because it amplifies the anti-inflammatory effects of turmeric root.\n\nThe problem is that I live in a highrise which has had a Pharaoh ant problem for at least half a decade.  I am not seeking solutions to the ants in this post because it's another problem entirely.\n\nPharaoh ants are small and have managed to crawl into a closed box of table salt.  They would have no problem getting into a pepper grinder.\n\nKeeping the pepper grinder in a container is not ideal because the ants can crawl along the rim of the lid unnoticed. Using a zip-lock bag is also not ideal because they can crawl unnoticed along seams.\n\nThe fridge seems safe.  My concern is that when I bring a cold pepper grinder in contact with room temperature air, condensation forms, either on the grinding mechanism or the peppercorn itself.  If it was just a sealed container, it wouldn't be a big deal because the air in the cold fridge is dry and will evaporate away any surface moisture.  My concern would then be that room air enters the chamber containing the peppercorn and might not dry out promptly when placed back in the fridge.  With repeated usage like this, mold may be a problem.\n\nDoes anyone know whether it is advisable to store a pepper grinder in the fridge?\n\n**Afternote:** I appreciate that people have shared their thoughts.  It doesn't sound like anyone actually does this, though, nor is aware of where it may be common practice.

I\u2019m aware that the liquid serves as a buffer to osmotic pressure and leaking to keep it fresh, but I also know there are other ways to extend and strengthen the shelf life of popping boba, essentially certain ingredients, stabilizers, humectants which can help retain its moisture and lot leak out through the membrane\n\nCurrently to make the popping boba I'm using the reverse spherification method.\n\nHere is my current list of ingredients:\n\n**Popping boba solution:**\n\n**Cranberry Juice(what I'm making the popping boba out of): 250 g**\n\n**Karo Corn Syrup(mixed with the cranberry juice): 50 g**\n\n**Calcium lactate: 3 g**\n\n**Calcium chloride: .5 g**\n\n**Citric Acid: .5 g**\n\n**Malic Acid: .9 g**\n\n**Potassium Sorbate: .5 g**\n\n**Xanthan Gum: .5 g**\n\n**Sodium Alginate solution:**\n\n**Sodium Alginate: 3.5 g**\n\n**Distilled Water: 500 mL**\n\nI've tried different amounts of certain ingredients, higher concentrations of calcium lactate, higher concentration of the sodium alginate solutions, and there have been some good progress made but not as close as I would be hoping for.\n\nOnce I remove the formed popping boba from the sodium alginate solution bath, I place it in a ziploc bag and into the fridge. After an hour or so it starts leaking from the membrane and by the next day it is deflated.\n\nI've tried covering the popping boba in corn starch, carnauba wax solutions, sugar, etc. and nothing seems to be helping. I have not added humectants though thats what I think the next plan is to do so.\n\nI guess im here now to ask if anyone has any ideas regarding anything which I can do to preserve the popping boba from leaking, either it be certain ingredients I have or haven't used yet most notably humectants which are supposed to retain liquid, or storing methods as I know ziploc bags are not the most airtight of containers.\n\nSome comparisons to retaining freshness and shelf quality which\u00a0 might relate this to can be certain store candies, gummies which retain good moisture, or fruit cups or other sealed moisture based snacks.\n\nPlease give any ideas or suggestions, I'm all ears at this point.\n\nTL/DR: Popping boba keeps drying out and leaking, need any solutions or suggestions to maintain freshness/moisture either through ingredients, process, or packaging/storing.

I find they have a great level of sweetness, intense blueberry flavor, and a satisfying \"snappy\" texture to the skin, but one recipe I read mentioned that if the blueberries are too large the sugar can burn causing the waffles to stick to the iron and become bitter\n\nWhat's going to get me the most blueberry bang for my buck without causing issues? \n\nAll thoughts very much appreciated.

{"title": "Did my meringues deflate due to lack of sugar?", "selftext": "I made this recipe from the NYT the other day: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015821-vanilla-meringues \n\nArchive here: https://archive.ph/W75dX\n\nI followed it pretty much exactly as it was written and it came out great. The only difference is that I started with cold egg whites, but just beat them for a long time until they came up to room temp. \n\nToday I decided to try the chocolate variant suggested by the top comment: \n\n> For chocolate meringues: Omit vanilla and sift 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder with half the sugar. Add to egg whites, cream of tartar and salt. Continue with Step 1.\n\nBut today they deflated! Is it due to lack of sugar? Or could it be that they ended up more stable when I started with the cold egg whites the other day? I did the test of turning them upside down to see if the mixture moved today and it seemed pretty stable. But maybe I should have beat them longer anyway? \n\nI suppose there's nothing to be done for this batch is there? Any suggestions for a use for them?\n\nETA: I think it's because today I whipped them too quickly and at high speed. I did it slower and longer yesterday because they were still cold. \n\nETA2: After even more reading, it does seem like reducing the sugar is a bad idea too. Most people seem to say that a 2:1 ratio is needed for structural integrity. Which is too bad because less sweet meringues would be nice! I often find them borderline too sweet. Oh well. Often the NYT comment section is very good, but this time it seems to have been off the mark.\n\n>  It may seem counterintuitive to whisk on medium speed when you could make a meringue much faster by beating the egg whites on high speed for less time, but the key to a meringue that won\u2019t deflate is to go slower for longer. As I wrote in my chocolate mousse recipe, the bubbles in egg whites become smaller and more stable the longer we whip them. As Herv\u00e9 This explains in his book Kitchen Mysteries, the process of whipping helps to unfold egg white proteins and connect them with one another, creating a network that protects the tiny bubbles. Whisking for longer also helps to ensure your sugar is properly incorporated, which reduces the risk of weeping.\n\n> This may be surprising, but whipping your eggs slower for longer also helps prevent overbeating. Whisk your egg whites too long, and the proteins will bond too tightly, essentially \u201ccooking\u201d the whites. An overbeaten meringue will lose its sheen and become a lumpy, uneven foam, and fail to rise in the oven when baked. \n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-meringue-cookies-recipe-8656492", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jf5n5m/did_my_meringues_deflate_due_to_lack_of_sugar/", "created_utc": 1742412996.0, "score": 2, "author": "AQuestionOfBlood", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jf5n5m/did_my_meringues_deflate_due_to_lack_of_sugar/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Butter Bell / science question", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a potter, and have started making butter bells. I have a question about the science re how they work.\n\nConventional wisdom says that a bell prevents butter from become rancid because water stays in contact with the butter, thus creating a seal preventing oxygen from reaching the butter ([see illustration](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B-gR2HaIL.jpg))\n\nIn practice, however, this is not what happens. If the butter is filled to the brim of the bell, yes. But once some of the butter is used, and the butter level falls below the rim of the jar, water will no longer touch the butter because a vacuum is created. It's the same idea as holding a drinking glass upside down and submerging it in water.\n\nI imagine this still works to keep the butter fresh - the water is indeed creating an airtight seal such that no new outside air is entering. But there will still be a pocket of non-circulating air between the butter and the water.\n\nDoes this track? And is exposure to air, as long as it does not circulate, ok when trying to preserving butter at room temp?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1it8ze3/butter_bell_science_question/", "created_utc": 1739981056.0, "score": 2, "author": "BlueAnnapolis", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1it8ze3/butter_bell_science_question/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Tips for making fruit-flavored creme brulee?", "selftext": "I've been trying to nail down a recipe for making fruit-flavored creme brulee, where the fruit flavor is actually incorporated into the custard. Most recipes I've seen online involve adding whole chunks of fruit, or an entirely separate. layer of coulis/fruit reduction. \n\nMy first attempt did not turn out well: \n\n- I cooked down a pound of strawberries with 1/4 cup of sugar and a splash of lemon juice, then passed this through a fine-mesh sieve to get a pretty thick sauce (lost a good amount of fruit here because it wouldn't pass through the sieve). \n- I added this to my [normal creme brulee recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9039-vanilla-creme-brulee) (only reducing the cream by a little, no other alterations). Because the fruit sauce was so thick, I had to whisk the custard a lot to mix it in evenly and ended up over-aerating the custard (but I didn't realize this at the time/was in a rush, so just baked it anyways). \n- The end result had a foam-like quality to it, definitely not what I had intended. The strawberry flavor also wasn't a strong as I would have liked.\n\nMy second attempt was a little better, but still not great:\n\n- I decided to use 1.5 pounds of fruit to increase the strawberry flavor and also blend the fruit prior to cooking it (I would blend after, but I have a shitty blender that can't handle hot liquids). My hope was that blending it would reduce the amount of fruit lost to the sieve (boosting the strawberry flavor) as well as result in a smoother sauce that would be easier to incorporate into the custard. \n- I did accomplish both goals - the custard was not over-mixed and the fruit flavor was more noticeable. \n- However, I neglected to account for how adding that much extra liquid would affect the custard setting. Because I don't trust myself to consistently judge texture/consistency, I normally pull my creme brulees based on internal temps taken with a thermometer. I took them out of the oven at the same temp as usual, not paying much attention to the actual consistency. Once they fully cooled, they essentially had the texture of yogurt - not exactly what I was looking for.\n\nI'll be making my third attempt soon, and plan to try the following:\n\n- Use only 1 pound of fruit to reduce the final amount of liquid added to the custard. Still plan to blend the fruit prior to reducing to help smooth out the final sauce. I'm hoping this will produce a strong-enough strawberry flavor without diluting the custard too much.\n- Bake the custard for a longer period of time, and try to judge doneness visually since I have no idea what the appropriate temperature would be.\n\nI'm still debating on trying the following to help fix the texture even more:\n\n- Adding an extra egg yolk to help thicken the custard, AND/OR\n- Reducing the amount of cream so that the ratio of egg yolks to other liquids is the same as the original recipe\n\nI'm crossing my fingers that the third time's the charm, and I'd really appreciate any thoughts anyone might have/suggestions on changing up things that I haven't considered!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1isowuv/tips_for_making_fruitflavored_creme_brulee/", "created_utc": 1739917106.0, "score": 16, "author": "theasianpianist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1isowuv/tips_for_making_fruitflavored_creme_brulee/", "html_title": ""}
