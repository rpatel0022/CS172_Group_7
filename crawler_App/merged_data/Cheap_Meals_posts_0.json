{"title": "How I survived on a $10 a week grocery budget for the last 2 and a half years.", "selftext": "I researched prices of what I like to eat at area grocery stores for the lowest prices. I rotate the stores each week. \n\nAt Dollar Tree, I get\n\n1 bread\n2 meat \n1 frozen vegetable bag\n1 frozen fruit bag\n3 items from pantry\n1 brick of cheese\n1 breakfast item\n\nIf I get tortilla as my bread then I would get ground  sausage and canned chicken as my meat.The frozen vegetable would be the pepper and onion blend. The frozen fruit would be strawberry/banana blend. Cheese brick would be a cheddar and breakfast would be eggs. Pantry would be a bag of rice, a can of pea/carrot and a soy sauce. \n\nMeals would be breakfast burrito or quiche with fruit smoothy for breakfast . Hard boiled eggs or fruit for a snack. Lunch would be quesadillas or chicken fajitas with a side of rice. Dinner would be a fried rice. \n\nThere is going to be leftover rice and vegetables.\n\nThe next week a Aldi I would get bouillon cubes and whatever meat is on clearance(right now its bratwurst at $1.25). I would get flour, yeast, salt, cooking oil, spaghetti sauce, 1/2 gallon of milk and brick of cheese.\n\nThe following week At Walmart, I buy a case of 60 eggs for $3.30 cents. I also get more frozen vegetables. I also get an 88 cents spice (minced onion is my favorite). I get baking powder and some cheap pasta from the ethnic aisle(24 cents to 28 cents). I check out the clearance meat and get a cheap pack.\n\nWith each trip to the grocery store I add ingredients to build up a variety in my diet.  I budget my portions to never go hungry and I work at not wasting food.\n\nIn the 2 and 1/2 years on this budget, I have a fully stocked upright freezer. I have fully stocked pantry shelves. I have enough food these days so now I do not even need to go to the grocery store each week. This week a bought 5 pancake mix and 5 syrup to donate to a food pantry.\n\nEDIT #1. Thank you for the upvotes.\n\nI live in rural midwest. It is about 15 miles in any direction to a city with a choice of grocery stores. \n\nSome weeks, I even do my grocery shopping at the Menards Hardware Store. Canned beans are 40 cents and canned diced tomatoes are 46 cents. Some months, Menards has rebates on everything you buy. Other months, it is time to cash in your rebates.\n\nEdit #2.\n\nHow I got to this bought. \n\nI used to have the middle class life. Then, I got an aggressive type of cancer that typically leaves no survivors. My now ex husband just wanted me to die so he could get the life insurance.  My family and friends dumped me because they did not want to be there through the cancer battle. I became a homeless cancer patient. I struggled and was judge to be something I was not. One day at a soup kitchen, I lost my temper in front of a bunch of religious people and soup kitchen donors who were telling me that I needed to get off drugs and get a job. I was on cancer IV treatments at a local cancer center twice a week. So I rose my voice and invited them to come with me to my treatment on Tuesday or Thursday. One of the money donors took me up on it and actually came. We talked. He had an empty house that he could not rent out but had his own struggles and could not pay me but I would house sit every night and would have free housing and utilities. I took the job so I have housing. I frequently pass out and do not heal as I used to because of the toll cancer and treatments took so no one will hire me for employment. Food banks and food pantries require this thing called a utility bill with my name on it which I do not have. \n\nI beat the  cancer.  I am divorced. I am still house sitting. I do odd jobs for money to take care of me. I collect aluminum cans and take them to recycle. I do mending. I also do internet work for seniors. One of the seniors that I do internet work for gave me a bonus on top of the money he owed me for getting him signed up for the COVID vaccine and the many hours spent at the library getting copies and faxes done for him. \n\nI do food prep on Wednesday and Saturday. Yesterday was Wednesday. I made a batch of biscuits which became 8 biscuit sandwiches 4 were frozen and 4 are in the refrigerator. I baked one big chicken breast and cut it into 4 packs of about 4 ounces of cooked chicken, I packed up 2 for freezing. I fried up one pound of ground beef and divided it up into six 2 ounce packs. I froze 3 packs of the ground beef. I can easily boil pasta or rice and add frozen or canned vegetables and sauce to make a meal. One bouillon cube in water with frozen vegetables makes a quick soup and I can even add a pack of precooked meat. \n\nI did not get a stimulus check in either round because my ex husband committed tax fraud.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/kj1uz1/how_i_survived_on_a_10_a_week_grocery_budget_for/", "created_utc": 1608759330.0, "score": 474, "author": "Familiar_Ad_2059", "num_comments": 36, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/kj1uz1/how_i_survived_on_a_10_a_week_grocery_budget_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The '4-3-5 Method', or How to Eat Like a College Student", "selftext": "I've posted about this before a few times in comments, but I figure it might be nice to lay the entire thing out for people. \n\nBack in college, I had practically no money and no time. At one point I was working three jobs so I could go to private college full time. The result was I was spending way too much money on take-out and I would go to mom or dad's house and binge, eating all their food. The situation was unworkable. The change came after, despite exercising 30 minutes every morning, I started gaining weight. \n\nI came up with an idea: meal planning. The idea would be to plan out exactly what I was eating ahead of time, shopping for only the ingredients I would use, and not to ever waste any food. I also liked the idea of buying in bulk to save money and I especially liked being able to micromanage nutrients and calories, something I'd never been successful in before. The first few weeks, I ate the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Turns out this was a mistake. We need variety, but how could I have variety while still being able to buy in bulk? \n\n*Four breakfasts, three lunches, and five dinners.* Shopping twice a month, I would, every shopping cycle, create a meal plan of four breakfasts, three lunches, and five dinners, and I would cycle them. The first day I would have breakfast 1, lunch 1, and dinner 1. The second day I would have breakfast 2, lunch 2, and dinner 2. The third day I would have breakfast 3, lunch 3, and dinner 3. The fourth day I would have breakfast 4, lunch 1, and dinner 4. The fifth day I would have breakfast 1, lunch 2, and dinner 5. The sixth day I would have breakfast 2, lunch 3, and dinner 1. By offsetting meals, it created the illusion of eating a varied diet, but I could still buy in bulk. \n\nAdditionally, since I was planning all of my meals ahead of time, I could break them all down to micro and macro nutrient content so each day I could have a wide variety of vitamins and minerals and I could balance carbohydrates, protein, and fat. I could even easily count calories. \n\nShopping was simply a matter of adding up all the ingredients for however many of each meal I would have and shopping for them and only them. I never threw anything out, because I ate everything. I saved money by being able to buy ingredients in bulk, especially lunch ingredients, and I chose meals that I loved eating and that were filling. \n\nFortunately, we now have access to services like [LiveStrong](http://www.livestrong.com/) that help managing calories and nutrients even more closely and without having to do homework at the store. \n\n**Example** (this is what I'm eating for the second half of February 2012)\n\nBreakfasts  \n1) Oatmeal with dried fruit, two hard-boiled eggs, and a coffee (2 c. oatmeal, 3/4 c. dried fruit, 2 eggs, 2 Tbs. coffee)  \n2) Scrambled eggs on toast with smoked salmon (4 eggs, 3/4 Tbs. butter, chives, 1/7 a small loaf of sourdough)  \n3) Large fruit smoothie (4 oz. soy milk, 4 oz. pomegranate juice, 1/2 frozen banana, 4 oz. frozen strawberries, 4 oz. frozen blueberries, and 4 oz. frozen mangoes)  \n4) Denver omelet (4 eggs, 1/2 Tbs. butter, 2 oz. shredded cheddar, 2 oz. shredded jack, 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/4 onion)  \n\nLunches  \n1) Garbanzo salad (1 can garbanzo beans, 1 cucumber, 6 cherry tomatoes, 1/4 red onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 oz. feta, Italian dressing, black olives, Romaine lettuce)  \n2) Tuna wrap (1 can solid tuna, 1/4 red onion, 1/2 c. parsley, olives, Romaine lettuce, olive oil, 2 Tbs. chopped black olives, 2 whole grain tortillas)  \n3) Spinach and avocado salad (12 oz. baby spinach, 1 Haas avocado, 1 Tbs. cilantro, juice of 1/2 lime, 1 Roma tomato, salt and pepper, 1/4 tsp. cumin)  \n\nDinners  \n1) Salmon filet with roasted asparagus and micro greens (1 salmon filet, olive oil, salt and pepper, 1/2 lb. asparagus, lemon, nutmeg, 1 cup microgreens)  \n2) Roman chicken (2 chicken thighs, 1/2 red bell pepper. 1/2 yellow bell pepper, 1/2 can diced tomatoes, olive oil, 1 slice prosciutto, 1/4 c. white wine, dried oregano, dried thyme, 2 Tbs. parsley leaves, 1/4 c. chicken stock)  \n3) Noodles with shiitake mushrooms (10 dried shiitake mushrooms, 2 baby bok choy, 1 package rice noodles, 1\" piece of ginger, soy sauce, 1 tsp,. sesame oil, white pepper)  \n4) Steak and salad (sirloin cut, nut oil, 1 Tbs. butter, 1 c. arugula, 1 Roma tomato, 1 radish, salt and pepper)  \n5) Chicken tostadas (1 chicken breast, 1 chipotle chile in adobo, 2 Roma tomatoes, juice of 1/2 lime, 1 clove garlic, 1 c. Romaine, 1 oz. queso fresco, olive oil, 2 whole wheat tortillas)  \n\nIt probably seems like I eat pretty damned well, but because I buy in bulk this ends up costing a lot less than it normally would. I think I spent about $130ish for all of this for half a month, and a few substitutions could easily get this down under $75. Back in college I could eat well for under $100 a month using this program. Admittedly, there was a lot of rice and beans, but it was manageable and I always looked forward to eating. \n\nSo there you have it, the 4-3-5- Method. If you're new to buying/making food or you want to make a change, it's a good option, imho. If you have any questions, please feel free to post below.

Now I know you're thinking \"that's disgusting!\", but hear me out! I've discovered ways to up your frozen pizza game.\n1) trick it out with whatever toppings you like. I'm vegetarian, so I like adding jalape\u00f1os, onions, garlic powder, black pepper, and oregano, but you could add meat or whatever your heart desires. I often add parmesan and extra shredded cheese as well. Red onions placed red-side up make for a colorful pizza.\n2) Cook it on a preheated pizza stone for a nice crispy crust. This was a big improvement from previous frozen pizzas I had made. Pizza stone was $30, but it's worth it if you eat pizza as often as I do.\n3) Set the oven to broil just before it is done cooking to get some nice browning on the cheese. Another big improvement.\n\nI like spicy food, so I dip it in ranch mixed with \"XXX spicy\" hot sauce \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nFor future experiments I will try mixing melted butter with garlic powder and rub this onto the crust with some paper towels prior to cooking.

{"title": "Some cheap, delicious, easy ways to get more vegetables in your diet", "selftext": "Probably almost all of us who follow this sub are not eating as many vegetables as we are supposed to. I've noticed a couple of requests for some vitamins/non-crock pot recipes lately, so I thought I'd share some ways I try to plow through all those vegetables in my fridge that I don't know what to do with. I'd like to hear your guys' ideas and collect some of your recipes for a healthier, more well-rounded diet.\n\nBeing a college student, I have had to make cheap meals for *years*. Here are some delicious, inexpensive, relatively quick ways to get your daily vitamins without breaking the bank. I look forward to hearing how you guys incorporate them!\n\n* * *\n\n###First and foremost, don't be afraid of frozen veggies.\n\nBagged broccoli, carrots, and peas keep extremely well, and they parboil them so you can spend minimal time in the kitchen. Put a few in a bowl and microwave them, or boil a pot of water to steam/boil them a couple minutes. Top with some butter, S&P and serve next to your proteins and carbs. It's a great way to get some vitamins into your diet when you're feeling lazy. Frozen vegetables also work well in saut\u00e9s.\n\nVegetables retain many of their vitamins when they are frozen, and they are usually frozen right off the plant. Vitamins in canned vegetables, however, have a tendency to break down quickly. Furthermore, when you live up north during winter, frozen vegetables can actually be better than using \"fresh,\" and in these dark months it can definitely be easier on the wallet.\n\n* * *\n\n###Secondly, make your own salad dressings.\n\nIt sounds intimidating, but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad. The hardest part is getting the proportion of oil to vinegar right, but that's easily remedied. For pockets that don't run very deep, even the Kraft dressings are acceptable when they go on sale; they last for months.\n\nHere are a couple that are in my rotation:\n\n* [Absolutely fabulous Greek/house dressing](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/absolutely-fabulous-greekhouse-dressing/detail.aspx)\n\n* [Caesar salad supreme](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/caesar-salad-supreme/detail.aspx) - I sub ~1 tsp. fish sauce for the anchovies\n\n* * *\n\n###Thirdly, saut\u00e9!\n\nThis is a great way to use up any fresh (or even frozen!) veggies you happen to have on hand. It's very versatile; you can add virtually any kind of vegetable and it will taste great. You can also play around with the seasonings and use hoisin sauce, broth, miso paste, sriracha, etc. The sauce itself isn't terribly different from good ol' [teriyaki](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-teriyaki-chicken/detail.aspx).\n\n**Default saut\u00e9 recipe**\n\n>* 3 Tbs soy sauce\n>* 1 tsp sesame oil (gets kinda pricey, but a great investment if you love asian food and want to be healthy)\n>* 1 Tbs honey\n>* 2 Tbs veg. oil (I use canola: it's cheap, has a neutral flavor, and isn't terrible for your health or the environment)\n>* 1 package (500g, not sure in US units) tofu, cubed (can substitute chicken-we often do it with rotisserie chicken leftovers, but if you're a carnivore you could use the entire chicken, also cubed)\n>* Asian noodles or rice (I use udon usually, $1/package in the Asian section, or basmati rice bought in bulk - Alton Brown's recipe [found below])\n>* 1 onion, diced\n>* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced (or put through a garlic press-another great investment. Otherwise, 1/4 tsp garlic powder)\n>* 1 Tbs fresh ginger (~3/4 teaspoon if dried)\n>* 1 bell pepper, sliced\n>* 1 zucchini, sliced\n>* 1 tsp dried basil (8 or so leaves of fresh, if you're lucky enough to have that)\n>\n>1. Mix the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey (and ginger/garlic, if you used dried instead of fresh) a bowl\n>2. Heat up a pan on med-high, put in half of the oil. Saut\u00e9 the tofu until it's golden brown, toss it a few times so it's on more than one side. This step is important for the texture of the tofu. If you're doing chicken, skip this step entirely - it's already cooked. Once the tofu is done, transfer it (or the diced chicken) into the bowl with the sauce mixture.\n>3. In the same pan, add the rest of the oil and saut\u00e9 your onions, garlic, and ginger (if fresh - and, at this point, celery, carrots, leeks, or cabbage) for about 2 minutes.\n>4. Add your bell pepper (and/or broccoli, parboiled cauliflower), cook for 1 minute.\n>5. Add the zucchini (and/or mushrooms, green onions), cook for another minute.\n>6. Add the tofu and the sauce into the pan and cook for 2 minutes.\n>7. Add the noodles, cook for 1-2 more minutes.\n>8. Add basil (and spinach, if it's in your fridge), take off the heat, and serve.\n\nCounting prep time, this can take a whole 20 minutes to prepare, and is full of vitamins and protein. Don't be afraid of tofu--it tastes great if you can cook it properly, and it's cheap as hell (at least here in Canada).\n\nI can't find Alton Brown's recipe, but I swear I learned how to make rice from him:\n\n**Alton Brown's perfect rice recipe**\n\n>* 1 c. rice\n>* 1 Tbs oil\n>* 2 c. **boiling** water (or broth of your flavor)\n>\n>1. Preheat a pan on med-high. While that's going, rinse rice 2-3 times. For this I use a large bowl and a small [mesh strainer](http://www.allianceonline.co.uk/product_images/LFMS0006.jpg) (you can probably find them at the dollar store). This step is CRITICAL for rice texture.\n>2. Boil the broth in the microwave, or the water in either a kettle or the microwave. While it's running, put the oil in the pan, followed by the rice. Move them around as the microwave is running. The goal here is to kind of toast the rice, to get them to pop, so that they impart a deeper flavor.\n>3. As soon as your stuff is boiling, pour it CAREFULLY into the pan. Measure it when it's at boiling temp.; if you measure it before you put it in a kettle it might come out to less liquid, and the ratio is important.\n>4. (Optional) add some curry if you wish, or some other flavors. Play around a bit! :)\n>5. Cover that pan, turn it down to low (2-3 on my stove, which goes up to 10), and leave it alone for 17 minutes. Don't even think about lifting the cover. If you do, the rice will come out dry. Leave it alone, and let it do its own thing. It works like magic. Trust me.\n\n* * *\n\n###Finally, soups!\n\nWho doesn't like a nice potage when it's this cold outside? You can use lots of different kinds of veggies for these. Everything ranging from apples to sweet potatoes to broccoli, you can most definitely turn into a creamy, hearty meal. Here are a few that I've used:\n\n* [Roasted butternut squash soup with apple and bacon](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/roasted-butternut-squash-soup-with-apples-and-bacon/detail.aspx) - By far my favorite. Not even kidding, you could easily sell this dish at $10 a bowl if you owned a restaurant.\n\n* [Sweet potato, carrot, apple, and red lentil soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-potato-carrot-apple-and-red-lentil-soup/detail.aspx)\n\n* [Curried carrot soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/curried-carrot-soup/detail.aspx)\n\n* [Cream of asparagus soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-of-fresh-asparagus-soup-ii/detail.aspx) - Frozen asparagus works perfectly here, and takes a lot less time.\n\n* [Cream of broccoli soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-cream-of-broccoli-soup/detail.aspx)\n\nThere's a constant theme through most soups. All it takes, really, is an onion, S&P, some kind of broth, and vegetable(s). Play around with the veggies, add butter and seasonings to your preference, toss in the blender, and voil\u00e0! Vitamins, vitamins everywhere!\n\n* * *\n\n##Don't forget to comment & share your favorite veggie-heavy recipes!\n\n* * *\n\n**TL;DR:** Make your own dressings, use frozen bagged vegetables, saut\u00e9 & make soups out of ALL the veggies!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/17w18j/some_cheap_delicious_easy_ways_to_get_more/", "created_utc": 1360013329.0, "score": 195, "author": "None", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/17w18j/some_cheap_delicious_easy_ways_to_get_more/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to eat for a week on $50 without relying on beans?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm a longtime lurker and up until now I've been able to figure out how to eat enough each week for under $100 (I have a very high metabolism and need 2500-3000 cals/day to feel healthy). However, my financial situation has changed, I'm not able to afford that anymore, and I'm losing weight too fast since not being able to eat enough (while already being considered underweight).\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to eat for a week for $50? Due to medical reasons I can't eat beans often (maybe 1-2 times a week) but costs of tuna, rice, bread, chicken, milk, everything is pricing me out of even the cheapest ingredients. I'm slowly starving and I'm not sure what meals I can afford that will actually be enough anymore. \n\nEven if I go to food pantries and get on food stamps, what kinds of ingredients should I look for and what meals should I plan for? \n\nThank you so so much for any input!

Add vegetables into the noodles and stir well. Ramen noodles tend to stick together easy and it takes a bit to work the vegetables into it. Now add a generous amount of BBQ sauce and hot sauce. I used Devil's Spit BBQ sauce for the added kick. Sauce it to your liking, but the more sauce will help it stay wetter longer when you save the leftovers.\n\nNow the key ingredient. The eggs. Scramble the two eggs in a separate bowl and then mix in both packets of the ramen seasoning. This is crucial. The egg is going to become faux-meat since it will have all the flavoring of the meat from the seasoning.\n\nDump the noodles/veggie mix into a frying pan. Now drizzle the egg over all the noodles. Keep stirring up now. The egg will mainly cook onto the noodles and give it some flavor, but some egg will chunk itself. Cook it for a while, some of the egg mixture won't fall through the bottom or you won't let all the noodles touch the bottom of the pan, so you'll be relying on the steam from the noodles to cook the egg. No one wants a runny egg in your noodles.\n\nAnd that's it! I can get 3 plates out of it. It's not bad at all for ramen.\n$.25 per pack of ramen\n\n$.30 for two eggs\n\n$.69 for can of vegetables\n\nand assuming you already have BBQ sauce and hot sauce at home.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/12npd1/my_favorite_ramen_creation_spicy_bbq_chicken/", "created_utc": 1352100901.0, "score": 164, "author": "yiggity_yag", "num_comments": 49, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/12npd1/my_favorite_ramen_creation_spicy_bbq_chicken/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pasta, vegetables and cream sauce. Takes about 30 minutes, is under 500 calories and less than $1 per serving.", "selftext": "Apparently this got removed from r/EatCheapAndHealthy for some reason (based on the comments, jarred sauce is a sin, pasta isn't healthy, I'm going to die fat and lonely, my dog's ugly, my breath smells like dollar store garlic, etc.).  But, it had > 1300 upvotes so some people liked it and it's a shame it was taken down.\n\n\\-----\n\nThe following dish can be made in about 30 minutes, is less than 500 calories per serving and costs less than $1 (about $.81 where I live ymmv) per serving. The recipe makes about 8 servings (real servings, not \"2 Oreo cookies per serving\" nonsense).\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 jars of [Bertolli Alfredo sauce](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Bertolli-Alfredo-with-Aged-Parmesan-Cheese-Pasta-Sauce-15-oz-Pack-of-2/41583459) $3.68 (for 2 jars)\n\n1 box of [Radiatore pasta](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Radiatore-Macaroni-16-oz/10534081) $.80\n\n2 bags of [frozen California mixed vegetables](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-California-Style-Vegetable-Mix-12-oz/857019836) $2.00 (for 2 bags)\n\n1/2 - 3/4 cup of water (for sauce)\n\nInstructions:\n\n* Get a pot of water boiling\n* When the pot of water is boiling, put the noodles in to cook for 10 - 12 minutes; at the same time, microwave both bags of vegetables for 8 minutes (1,000 watt microwave)\n* Pour both jars of sauce in a sauce pan. Pour about 1/2 cup of water in the sauce jar, put the lid on it and mix it about. Pour this into the other jar. Pour into the sauce pan. Do this again with 1/4 cup of water if you'd like to get as much sauce out of the jars as possible. I probably use a total of 1 cup and the sauce is never too watery for us.\n* Heat the sauce on low, stirring frequently.\n* When the vegetables are done, pour them into the strainer.\n* When the pasta is done, add the vegetables to the sauce. Put the pasta in the strainer.\n* When the pasta is strained, put it back in the pot, add the vegetable / sauce mix and gently fold everything together to coat the pasta.\n\nWe love this meal. It's fast, easy and cheap. A few notes:\n\n* You can cut down about 110 calories per serving by only using 1 jar of sauce.\n* You can add protein by having with a grilled chicken breast (for example).\n* My wife likes leftovers of this with a can of tuna. I think that's absolutely disgusting (but I hate tuna).\n* If it's cold weather (or if you're eating this during the summer and you have the air on), microwave your bowls / plates for a minute or two to take the chill off. This will keep the pasta from getting cold before you can eat it all.\n* It is actually quite filling. Unfortunately, it tastes really good so if you let yourself have a second bowl, you will feel absolutely stuffed and hate yourself for 30 minutes afterwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y3gsjiunajc41.jpg?width=3539&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=793da9160ab5da8b820dce29b4ba2ce4269156df", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/estgqa/pasta_vegetables_and_cream_sauce_takes_about_30/", "created_utc": 1579787897.0, "score": 157, "author": "KickSidebottom", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/estgqa/pasta_vegetables_and_cream_sauce_takes_about_30/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Quarantine Chicken Salad", "selftext": "So I actually use this recipe a lot, but it\u2019s a great recipe for quarantine as the ingredients all have a long shelf life and you can make just enough for about 4 servings at a time. There\u2019s also no cooking involved which is a plus. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna start with a can of chunk white chicken. I like to keep a bunch of these in my pantry because they\u2019re so versatile when cooking. Drain the water and add to a medium bowl. Next add about a 1/2 cup of mayonnaise. You can add more of less depending on what you like. Then add one tablespoon of relish. Again, add more or less depending on what you like. Finally, an apple. Apples are great for quarantine because they can last up to 2 months when refrigerated. Celery is traditional for chicken salad, but I like to use apples to replace the nice crunch it adds. You can use any apple you like but I prefer Granny Smith. Dice up half of the apple and add it to the bowl. Save the rest for snacking. Mix it up and add salt and pepper to taste. \n\nAnd there you have it. Easy chicken salad that is under $6 for 3-4 servings. You can eat by itself or as a sandwich. Enjoy!\n\nETA: Grapes, celery, and sliced almonds make a great addition as well. Just slice up a few and throw them in. The good thing about chicken salad is that you can add whatever you like. My mom even likes to add dried cranberries. I didn\u2019t include those in the recipe as those are a little more expensive or don\u2019t stay as long.

{"title": "/r/Cheap_Meals: State of the Subreddit", "selftext": "Okay, not really a state of the subreddit. More a course-change. \n\nWhen I took over to help moderate /r/Cheap_Meals it was in the early days of Reddit. Subreddits were small, spammers hadn\u2019t even really arrived yet, and most of the people were just looking for a better alternative to Digg. I offered to help out because the single mod/admin was getting a little overwhelmed with the influx of new users and content to moderate. I helped balance things out for a time, but that founding mod/admin deleted their account and disappeared. \n\n/r/Cheap_Meals grew, but it never quite developed a core group of members. Instead, over time as it went from 5,000 to tens of thousands of subscribers, the original non-spam content decreased while the borderline and outright spam increased. Also adulthood happened for me. I pruned spammers when I could, but when I really removed the spammers there were basically no new submissions. Plus, some of the spam was quite well upvoted. \n\nIt\u2019s time for that to change, and if you're interested I'd love some help. \n\nI\u2019m going to start posting more recipes, more discussion threads, and try to get cracking finishing our subreddit Wiki. /u/NinjaSupplyCompany has graciously offered to come on board (everyone please offer them a warm welcome!) to help out to that end, in fact the first thing they said to me was they miss the old days. I\u2019d love for you reading this to see this as a potential opportunity to bring a subreddit that helps out people trying to make ends meet back to life. I would love you y'all to ***post more recipes, post more discussions, and post more questions***, should you have them and have the interest. \n\nAs for the spam? Having two of us on duty will help, but I\u2019m asking that you deputize yourself and ***please report spam***. \n\nWhat\u2019s spam? Spam is advertising one\u2019s own content, and a spammer is someone who for at least 9 of their posts has 1 advertising submission or comment. I\u2019m not going to completely ban any and all self-promotion, but Reddit has an advertising program and using subreddits for free is stealing advertising and not using communities like /r/Cheap_Meals the way they\u2019re intended to be used. ***Please report the spammers***. I just installed Toolbox for Reddit which will help me stay on top of this. \n_______________________________\n####The express purpose of this subreddit is to help people feed themselves and their families on a responsible and potentially quite limited budget. Given the economic situation a lot of us are in, given that a lot of us are dealing with stagnating or even lowered wages at the same time cost of living seems in a perpetual upward spiral, given that the new semester is about to begin for quite a few starving college students and starving adjunct professors, I think this subreddit and others like it have the potential to not only be a nice place to exchange ideas about frugal food, but to actually help people who are in need.

{"title": "Do you have any truly simple recipes? (bonus: my onion soup recipe)", "selftext": "I hate looking up so-called \"simple\" recipes only to find that it calls for 10 ingredients, 5 of which are just spices that could be cut from the recipe and it would still be fine. I just want the *simplest possible way* you could make this, and if I feel like it, I might add the garlic or basil or whatever I think I'd like in it. I'm not always good at determining what's truly needed for the dish and what's not, so many times this means I forego a promising meal because it looks either too difficult or, more often, too expensive.\n\nWhat are some simple recipes you have that are *truly* simple?\n\nI also posted this to /r/Cooking but I figured I will get some very different answers from r/Cheap_Meals and r/Cooking.\n\nI'll give one of mine to start it off.\n\n**ndstumme's Onion Soup**\n\nServes 3-4. Takes 1.5-2 hours.\n\n*Ingredients*\n\n* 3 very large yellow onions -$.90-$5.00 depending on where you live/where you buy them.\n* 6 cups of beef broth (I use bouillon cubes and water) - $2.50 for a jar of 25 bouillon cubes, but you only need 6.\n* 4 Tbsp butter (half a stick)\n* 1 Tbsp flour\n* 1 cup red wine (not sure if needed since I've never *not* used it. Could probably get away without it, but I always have wine around)\n* (Optional - see below) Shredded cheese\n\n*Price:* It's hard to price a half stick of butter, but I think overall you're looking at a meal for 4 for definitely less than $10 out of pocket, possibly less than $5. Less if you already have the broth/bouillon, butter, flour, etc.\n\n*Directions*\n\n* Chop the onions. \n\n* Put the broth in a soup pot and set it on the stove to a low heat (1 or 2 setting). \n\n* In a skillet or small pot melt the butter. Once melted add the onions and let them saut\u00e9 til brown. I set the stove to medium heat (4 on a scale of 1-7). Stir occasionally.\n\nThis is the waiting game so turn on some tunes or, if you're me, Red vs Blue, as it will be about a half hour. If they haven't changed color after the half hour, but are adequately squishy and butter-soaked I usually call that good and move on to the next step.\n\n* Add the flour to the onions and stir. Mixed well it will create a thicker onion-paste. Let cook for a few more minutes. Add the wine to the onions and stir to de-glaze them a bit, then add the whole mixture to the broth.\n\nTime for more waiting. Let it simmer on a 2 or 3 for another half hour to an hour. Stir occasionally. After that it's done.\n\nIt's truly that simple: saute onions, add them to broth, and let it sit forever. Five ingredients. No spices unless wanted.\n\nNow, once it's cooked I like to add some shredded cheese to my bowl, usually white cheddar. I list this as an optional ingredient, however, because it's not needed, and it works just fine without the cheese. Doesn't work so fine without the flour.\n\nEDIT: added more details to comply with the spirit of /r/Cheap_Meals\n\nEDIT2: You guys have some great ideas here. I'm gonna have to slowly work my way down the list and try them. Sometimes it's nice to share something that you might not even consider a recipe. In my mind 'simple' doesn't necessarily mean 'quick' or 'cheap' (though I prefer cheap), rather just straightforward. It doesn't take much to figure out what's happening in the recipe, even if it does take over an hour because something has to bake.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/14d7x9/do_you_have_any_truly_simple_recipes_bonus_my/", "created_utc": 1354768354.0, "score": 130, "author": "ndstumme", "num_comments": 113, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/14d7x9/do_you_have_any_truly_simple_recipes_bonus_my/", "html_title": ""}

Recipe and pics [here](http://jovialfoods.com/blog/2012/01/sour-dough-bread-starter/). (Don't get thrown by the \"Einkorn flour\"...regular flour is just fine.)\n1. Cook the bag of the beans so that they're ready to use.  Instructions [here](http://www.budget101.com/recipes/diy-how-prepare-garbanzo-beans-chick-peas-4045.html). (You can do this with any type of beans)\n1. Peel and slice the bananas about 1/2 inch thick. Put the slices in one layer on a cookie sheet and freeze for an hour.  Put in a zip top bag and keep in the freezer to be used in smoothies later.\n1. Remove the skin from the chicken leg quarters and throw them in a large pot, cover with water.  Bring to a boil, put the lid on, reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours.  When the 2 hours is up, strain the broth into a container to save for when you make the chicken & dumplings. Pick all of the meat off the bones and put into zip top bags.  You now have several cups of cooked chicken ready to eat as-is or it can be thrown in a recipe.\n\n**Breakfasts:**\n\n* [Peanut butter banana smoothies](http://www.food.com/recipe/choco-nana-peanut-butter-smoothie-419111)\n* [oatmeal](http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/cooking-basics/how-to-cook-oatmeal/) with berries\n* Sourdough [french toast](http://oneperfectbite.blogspot.com/2011/12/french-toast.html#.VBwh7fldWSp)\n* [Fried potatoes](http://www.food.com/recipe/sunday-morning-fried-potatoes-59442) and eggs\n* Homemade [blueberry muffins](http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2013/01/07/sparkling-jumbo-blueberry-muffins-2/) with an [omelet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57afEWn-QDg)\n* [Pancakes](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Good-Old-Fashioned-Pancakes/Detail.aspx) with bananas and peanut butter\n* [Scrambled eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0) with hash browns\n\n\n**Lunches & Dinners(add the frozen veggies or eat them on the side):**\n\n* Turkey [shepherd's pie](http://www.grocerybudget101.com/content.php/166-Shepards-Pie) (use green beans in place of corn)\n* Taco style [lentils and brown rice](http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-inexpensive-lentil-tacos-304604)\n* [Creamed chicken and rice](http://hillbillyhousewife.com/creamedchicken.htm)\n* Baked chicken with [scalloped potatoes](http://www.budget101.com/dirt-cheap-recipes/make-your-own-scalloped-potatoes-2144.html)\n* [Chicken red beans and rice](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=377173)\n* [Chicken and dumplings](http://www.hillbillyhousewife.com/chickendumplings.htm) (don't worry about the \"3 lbs. chicken\", just use your broth and 2 cups cooked chicken from prep day)\n* [Turkey chili](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-turkey-chili/) and [biscuits](http://southern.food.com/recipe/southern-buttermilk-biscuits-26110) (Use [sour milk](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-a-quick-easy-buttermilk-substitute-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-185757) instead of buttermilk)\n* [Chicken fried rice](http://inspiredreamer.com/better-than-takeout-chicken-fried-rice/)\n* [Chicken pot pie](http://www.budget101.com/dirt-cheap-recipes/myo-chicken-pot-pie-2143.html)\n\n**Snacks/Desserts**\n\n* Remaining fruit\n* Sourdugh bread with peanut butter\n* [Sugar cookies](http://addapinch.com/cooking/chewy-sugar-cookies-recipe/)\n* [Rice pudding](http://www.budgetsavvydiva.com/2013/08/easy-rice-pudding-recipe/)\n* [Oat brittle](http://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/2gga9d/made_some_goodies_yesterday_for_my_nieces_college/ckiwpwk)\n\nFor even more ideas, there is a great blog post about getting healthy groceries from Dollar Tree for just $25/week [here](http://melomeals.blogspot.com/2013/11/25-dollar-tree-challenge-7-day-of.html).\n\n\nSo there you have it.  **Before anyone gets up in arms about the amount of carbs/fat/sugar/etc...I am not suggesting this as a regular daily way of eating.

{"title": "Powdered milk vs. regular milk", "selftext": "I grew up drinking milk every day, and I can't have cereal for breakfast without it.\n\nAs a 23 year-old living on my own in Washington, DC, though, I'm a little short on time, space, and money. My fridge is really small, so while my frugal upbringing taught me to only buy milk in gallon containers since it's cheaper by the ounce, that took up a lot of room. Also, if I was ever about to leave for more than a week, I'd have to chug all my leftover milk or it'd go bad.\n\nSo I started buying powdered milk. Bought in bulk, it costs about the same per-ounce as a gallon of milk. However, I save considerably in other ways because:\n\n-The powder doesn't need refrigeration, so I make a liter of liquid milk  at a time and leave the rest of the powder wherever, which saves me lots of fridge space.\n\n-I haven't had to walk or drive to the store to buy new milk in two months.\n\n-I re-use the same bottle (an old wide-mouthed orange juice container) to hold the milk, which is eco-friendly.\n\n-If I want a thick cream, I just increase the ratio of milk powder to water, no extra purchases necessary.\n\n-It makes breakfast-on-the-go really easy and leak-free. I just toss cereal in a tupperware with some milk powder and drop it in my bag. Whenever I get wherever I'm going, I run water on it, mix it up, and shazam, I have cereal with milk!\n\nAnyone else try this?\n\n(I've bought my powdered milk wholesale from BJ's so far, but I just found [this 8-pound bag of powder on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Saco-Instant-Non-Fat-quarts-8-Pound/dp/B000J41TB6) and will try that next.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/zsb3i/powdered_milk_vs_regular_milk/", "created_utc": 1347484002.0, "score": 127, "author": "robertgfthomas", "num_comments": 73, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/zsb3i/powdered_milk_vs_regular_milk/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Easy & Cheap Thai Curry ($2.40/serving using chicken)", "selftext": "My friends and family always ask me how I make my Thai curry, especially when we are used to spending $7-$10/plate for it at restaurants, so I am sharing the love:\n\n\nFirst of all, if you can, shop at an Asian grocery store for specialty items and produce to save money. I don't spend more than $2.50 on a bottle of fish sauce, $3.50/lb on Chinese eggplant, $1 on a can of coconut milk, 10 cents on a jalapeno or 15 cents for a piece of ginger at my local Asian grocer. Big chains jack up the prices on \"international\" food.\n\n\nMakes 8-10 servings:\n\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n\n- 2 cans coconut milk (not reduced fat) - you can add more coconut milk and use reduced fat if you want to serve as straight soup.\n\n- Fish sauce, 1-2 tbsp (some people are freaked out by/are allergic to fish sauce, so you can substitute with soy sauce. Soy sauce will discolor the curry though).\n\n- Salt to taste\n\n- Pepper to taste\n\n- Soy sauce 3 tbsp\n\n- Sugar (white or brown both work) 1-2 tbsp\n\n- Garlic (6 cloves) chopped\n\n- 1 Onion chopped\n\n- Lime juice 2 tbsp (or a lime chopped, Kaffir if you want to splurge)\n\n- Curry paste (I prefer Mae Ploy green curry paste) 1-3 tbsp depending on how hot you want it. I do 2-3. You can start with one and add in more later with the vegetables if you don't know your spice level.\n\n- Basil (handful or 1 tsp dried)\n\n- Ginger (a piece about 2 inches long, can use powdered 1 tbsp to sub) finely chopped\n\n- Cilantro (garnish)\n\n- Vegetable oil - 1 tbsp for veggies, 1-2 for protein\n\n- A protein 1-2 lbs (I prefer to get the fattier dark meat (legs or thighs and skin them, but really any protein works. Pork and chicken will be cheapest.)\n\n- Vegetables/fruit/fungus you like (I cook with some combination of 3-4 of these: bell pepper (1), potatoes (4-6), bamboo shoots (1 small can), mushrooms (1/3 lb), Chinese/Japanese eggplant (1), carrots (2-3), baby corn (1 small can), 1 zucchini, 3 tomatoes... basically everything tastes better in curry)  - chopped\n\n- 1 Jalapeno/3 Thai chili peppers sliced - (optional, for more heat) \n\n**COOKING:**\n\n\n1) Chop protein into bite size pieces. Season with salt, pepper, and soy sauce. \n\n2) Cook on stove in pan on medium with 1-2 tbsp of oil until cooked through (no pink/red) and set aside.\n\n\n3) Heat 1 tbsp oil in ideally a deep stock/soup pot on medium heat. Add garlic, onions, ginger and carrots if you are using those. Cook until onions become transparent.\n\n4) Add curry paste, cook 1 minute while stirring.\n\n5) Add in coconut milk.\n\n6) Add in fish sauce, sugar, lime juice/lime, basil, all other vegetables, your protein, and pepper(s).\n\n7) Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer (rolling boil, usually around 2-3/10) and cover. Cook for 25-45 minutes until protein and any hard vegetables are tender. Potatoes may take longer. I don't normally need to, but go ahead and salt and pepper to taste if you need it.\n\n8) Garnish w/cilantro. \n\n**Additional hack:**\n\n\nI like to serve this with Jasmine rice cooked at a 2:3 rice to water ratio in a rice cooker or covered pot.

Rice and beans are a staple food that can be found in indigenous and traditional cuisine from Central and South America to West Africa. It was independently invented by cultures separated by many thousands of miles, by mountains, by oceans. As the world has become smaller, rice and beans have spread and become part of nearly every regional diet. \n\nThe most famous bit of nutritional information about beans and rice is that, in combination, they supply all the amino acids your body needs but cannot make itself.

The money you spend ($30-40 for a run-of-the-mill one) will repay itself many times over.\n\n**Step 1:** Add a fresh starchy vegetable to the crockpot. (Chopped potato, sweet potato, yam, carrots, etc.\n\n**Step 2:** Add other dense vegetables to the crockpot. (Celery, onions, garlic, mushrooms, tomatoes... pretty much anything.)\n\n**Step 3:** Add dry beans to the crockpot.\n\n**Step 4:** *(optional)*: Add meat to the crockpot. Sliced, diced, chopped, whatever. If you want to cook a whole roast, you should probably stick it directly on top of Step 1 and fit everything else around it.\n\n**Step 5:** Add other stuff to the crockpot. I dunno, whatever you have laying around. Kimchi? Stale bread? Noodles? It's your food, whatever you like. Fresh garlic goes here. You do have fresh garlic, right? Go buy fresh garlic. It's worth the $1.\n\n**Step 6:** Season with seasonings you like. European style will be something like { rosemary, basil, thyme, oregano } + your choice of { dill, coriander, ground mustard (go easy on it!), paprika }. Mexican might be { cumin, cayenne pepper, parsley/cilantro, menudo mix (oregano, onion flakes, chili pepper) }. Korean might be { soy sauce, ginger, ground pepper/Sambal Ooelek ($3 for a jar from Huy Fong - same people who make Sriracha - at your Asian grocer), Korean pepper flakes }. Chinese might be { ginger, Chinese five spices, soy sauce or fish sauce }. Or make up your own! You're poor, may as well take this opportunity to have fun and experiment. You could stick in the weirdest spice combination possible - I dunno, ginger, tarragon, cayenne pepper, ground mustard, and fish sauce. As long as you've used the spices in reasonable amounts - about 1/2 to 1 to maybe 2 (if you know you like it) tbsp apiece for my personal 2 quart crockpot - it will be edible, you have my guarantee. (If you manage to make something *actually inedible*, you should probably go to the nearest major city, find the chef for the local expensive hipster experimental cuisine restaurant, sell the recipe, and celebrate with an ice cream cone.)\n\nEDIT: **STEP 7:** WATER. Water level should be close to the top of your stuff in the crockpot. As you gain experience you can move it from there (least = just cooking everything for serving on a plate, more = stew, most = soup).\n\nHave fun! This recipe is like [Zombocom](http://www.zombo.com/) - you can do anything with the crockpot!

{"title": "Home made chicken pilaf - Great for students!", "selftext": "So my mom recently gave me the recipe for her home made chicken pilaf... I know pilaf can be made many different ways, but this one is specifically how my mom and grandma make it...\n\nWe're of Serbian decent, so I guess our cooking has a balkan flavour to it (if that exists), but this is a super tastey, super easy to cook meal. It will last a student about 3-4 days, which is great in my case because I don't have to think about dinner for a while. I'll post a pic at the bottom. \n\nIngredients: \n\n1 red bell pepper, 1 red yellow bell pepper\n\n2 carrots (or 3 if they're smaller)\n\n2 yellow cooking onions\n\nparsley\n\nvegetable oil (or canola or olive, whichever works)\n\n1-ish cups of white rice (I say ish because I didn't really measure)\n\n1 tablespoon of tomato paste\n\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nPaprika (the red seasoning stuff)\n\nChicken drumsticks (boneless skinless, or with skin and bone, it doesn't matte. If you get it with the skin and bone the meat will slide off the bone anyway, so no need to de-bone it... I just happened to buy boneless)\n\n\nDirections:\n\n1) The first thing I did was put the rice in a bowl of water to soak while I prepped the food.\n\n2) In a saucepan coat the bottom with the cooking oil generously... but not more than a couple of millimetres\n\n3) Finely chop the onions and put them in the saucepan on low heat (I put it on low heat because I didn't chop all my ingredients beforehand, I just chopped as it was on the stove)\n\n4) Finely chop the carrots, peppers, and parsley, and add to the saucepan, bringing the temperature up to medium heat\n\nDon't forget to stir often!!!\n\n5) Add a tablespoon of tomato paste into the mixture, and add about half a cup to a cup of water (I didn't measure) to the mix. Stir it out so it's not all clumpy, it has to be even and runny. Don't add so much water so that it's like a soup, just add it so it's not thick. \n\n6) Add an even amount of salt and pepper and paprika (I didn't measure again, I just took my box of salt and quickly sprinkled it over the whole thing, the same with the paprika, and same with the pepper)\n\n7) Let this cook for about 10 minutes, and stir often. While this is cooking on the stove, you can prep your chicken. Since I bought boneless skinless I just cut it up into small-medium pieces and salted it before adding it to the mix.\n\n8) Add the chicken and stir often. Remember, you're just trying to cook it a bit, you don't need high heat so don't caramelize the onions and vegetables... the point is to soften it a bit, not make it mushy. \n\n9) After 5 minutes of cooking, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and get an oven safe dish with a lid ready.\n\n10) After you've cooked it for 10 minutes, transfer the contents in the saucepan into the oven safe dish, drain the rice, and add it to the mix. Stir the rice around so its kind of distributed evenly throughout the dish. Add about half a cup of water, but again, I didn't measure. I made sure the water was slightly over the contents so it looked like it was drowning in the water. (Don't worry about the water, it will be all absorbed into the rice and the pilaf will come out sticky and amazing, and the chicken will be amazing, and you will be in pilaf heaven).\n\n11) Set your cook time for an hour and a half, cover the dish with the lid and let it cook.\n\n12) When its done, take out the dish, let it cool off, and then stuff your face for the next three days!\n\nI spent about 20 odd dollars on the ingredients of this meal (I already had parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika at home), and it lasts me 3-4 days. I'd say that's pretty cheap!\n\nHope you try it, and enjoy!\n\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8ubeDVr.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/W7jMGeM.jpg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1ci1af/home_made_chicken_pilaf_great_for_students/", "created_utc": 1366159878.0, "score": 90, "author": "None", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1ci1af/home_made_chicken_pilaf_great_for_students/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "So, I splurged last night and spent \u00a320 on takeaway. I shall now repent by sharing a cheap recipe of mine.", "selftext": "[The costs should be similar to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/45zsg9/fancy_meal_for_under_350_a_batch_lasted_me_two/). It will take a lot longer to prep, but it's just as quick to cook. \n\nWhat it is: **My mum's Chilli Chicken** \n\n(Skip down for the ingredients/recipe)\n\nChilli chicken's a Bengali dish (Indo-Chinese origins) that's spread far and wide. It's popular as a main in streetside food stalls in Calcutta (might be the case in other cities as well, but I wouldn't know) and has become a special in many homes. Everyone makes their own kind, so the appearance varies from person to person. That said, whatever's pictured on the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilli_chicken) is certainly not in the area. That looks more fancy than it should be. \n\nIn any case, this is my mum's version, so let's get to it. \n\n**What you'll need** (extra super secret ingredient listed at the end!)\n\n* Chicken breasts (skinless, I'd also go with boneless)\n* Garlic, ginger, onions (red, preferably)\n* An egg\n* A capsicum/bell pepper (green, preferably)\n* Cornflour/flour\n* Chillies (green, bird's eye; you *can* leave them out, but I'd recommend keeping at least two around) \n* Oil (just go with vegetable oil)\n* Salt, pepper, MSG, water\n* Coriander, rice\n* Chilli sauce (optional) \n\nAnd now... for the extra super special secret ingredient. Drumroll, plearice/please\n\nThe thing about most Chilli chicken dishes is that the name's a lie. While ideally there should be chillies in a Chilli chicken, the star of the show is...    \n**Soy sauce!**       \n^(didn't see that one coming, did you?)\n\nSome people end up making red-coloured chilli chicken at home, and will swear by it. This just means there's a lot of tomato/red chilli sauce dumped into it. That's really not my thing. Tomatoes should not be in the same area as this meal, in my opinion. \n\n[Here's a terrible photo of my last batch (soy sauce overdose ftw!)](https://i.imgur.com/kdrqIRzh.jpg) plus extras (sweated and boiled spinach and chillies in vinegar and lime). \n\n**So, what do you do?**  \n\n**Prep** \n\n* Chop up your chicken into small-ish pieces (no more than 1\" on any side) and stab it all over with a fork. Really go at it. \n* Chop up a few cloves of garlic, and some of your green chillies into bitty bits and mix together (4:1), mash them as best you can. \n* Add a generous amount of soy sauce to a large bowl and drop your ~~onions~~**garlic**/chilli in. Add some salt, a small pinch of pepper, and MSG to this. Mix it all well together and leave it out for 20-30 minutes. \n* Drop your chicken in (the soy sauce should be just enough to cover the chicken. \n* Crack an egg, whisk it, and pour it into the marinade, stirring as you do. Repeat with a small amount of cornflour (pour + stir). \n* Stick the lot in the fridge for at least an hour. Take it out 20 minutes prior to cooking. \n\n[Here's a halfway-photo of my last marinade](https://i.imgur.com/qB0vIAd.jpg) from a year ago. \n\n**Cook**\n\n* Take out your marinade, and chop up a red onion half into bitty bits, and half into chunks. Slice some chillies, and cut up your capsicum. Crush some garlic, chop them up, and mash them with your blade. Shred some ginger (do two types: grated, and in long shreds). \n* Add oil to a pan, put it on medium heat. When hot, slide in your onion bits and shake them evenly out on the pan. You can slice open a chilli and leave it in the pan for a while with the onions if you want. Just remove it before continuing. \n* When your onions have softened, add a pinch of salt and your garlic (you can drop some grated ginger in as well). Stir it all together. \n* The minute you smell the flavours releasing, carefully add your chicken (without too much of the marinade liquid) to the pan. Stir it all together and crank up the heat. \n* **Note** Depending on how you want your capsicum and onion chunks cooked, they can go in any point between here and finishing. If adding whole garlic cloves (no skin) or shredded garlic, do so now. \n* When your chicken's beginning to firm up on all sides (you'll have to keep stirring), add enough water (straight from a kettle or such) to just cover your chicken mix, wait for it to come to a boil, put a lid on the pan, and turn the heat down to medium. \n* Put your rice on. \n* In about five minutes, uncover (careful of the steam/dripping water!), and check your chicken. If it's come to almost done, add salt to taste, a pinch of MSG, some grated ginger (if you will), and stir as much soy sauce as you want in for a final bit of flair. I like it thin, so I add quite a bit of soy and stir in a bit more water at this stage. Some people add chilli sauce here. \n* Garnish with sliced chillies and let it sit. \n* When your rice is done, garnish it with coriander. \n\n**Now what?** \n\nPour the sauce onto a plate, put your rice on it, and serve the chicken on the side. I like letting the sauce drip through the rice, but I like the rice itself to stay nice and dry, so when putting your chicken on your rice, eat those bits quickly. Put some chillies on the side, and nom away. My mum usually serves this after a starter of lightly salted boiled spinach and potato/paneer. But really, how many people have starters, anyway? \n\n**Wait, but how much?** \n\nPer unit, it comes upto something about just under **\u00a34** for me per chicken breast used. This is the absolute barebones version of the recipe, and it's *delicious*. \n\n\nGoodness, I had a lot of time on my hands... \n\n\n\nEdit: minor corrections.

{"title": "Kale and Chorizo soup - under $1 a bowl for a fully balanced soup!", "selftext": "This is one of my favorite soups to make and incredibly easy. It's good year round, has a nice spice to it. Best part? It's one of those cheap-to-make-but-doesn't-make-me-feel-like-I'm-poor-as-f meals. \n\nPic: http://imgur.com/w6T8GK0\n\nBasic recipe:\n\n* Chicken stock (for about 6-8 quarts broth)\n* 1 bunch cut kale, or 16oz bag of precut kale\n* 10oz chorizo, sliced\n* 1 yellow or sweet onion, squared\n* Pepper\n* Optional seasonings (that are cheap/you may have around): chilli powder, paprika, bullion cubes\n\nIn a large stockpot, **(1) simmer chicken stock**. You have a few alternatives: homemade chicken broth, canned/boxed broth from the supermarket, or concentrated stock pots (Knorr usually makes them). Stock pots are easily the cheapest and most convenient, using about three little tubs and supplementing with one bullion cube (you can get like 8 in a $1 box) is usually good for taste.\n\n**(2) Add kale.** Sometimes you can get bags of prechopped (like bagged salad) for $1-$2 on sale. Bunches are less convenient but much cheaper, around $1.50 for a bunch regular price. Note: kale holds up quite nicely, so you don't have to be too precise or uniform when cutting the kale up.\n\nAfter kale starts to soften up but not completely darken, **(3) add sliced chorizo.** This also holds up nicely, so you don't have to be uniform or cut these too precisely either. I like half slices, but you can just do full slices.\n\n**(4) Throw in chopped onion.** This is actually optional but I think it adds a nice third texture.\n\nSo when is the soup finished cooking? Kale should have darkened to a nice deep green, chorizo fully cooked (duh), and onions translucent. You literally dump in all ingredients, watch an episode of Breaking Bad, come back, and have a delicious soup waiting for you.\n\n*Optional Goodies:* Cannellini beans, $1 a can. The most temperamental of the ingredients, add towards the end until soft; overcooking will cause bean to fall out of its shell! **To make this a full meal,** consider putting in diced potatoes (note: don't put in hashbrowns, I tried using those diced ones and it was no bueno and tasted like breakfast) or pasta. Note that pasta, if let sitting, WILL absorb the broth. It's fine if you're finishing the batch in one sitting, but if you plan to save it your soup will be ruined. If you like the addition, try cooking it separately al dente and keep it in a container, just dumping it in to the soup bowl as needed.\n\nSo what's the cost? *To account for regional discrepancies and in case you're not buying on sale, I'm going to put higher estimates*\n\n* Chicken stock - $1-$3\n* Chorizo - $2-$3\n* Kale - $1-2\n* Onion < $1\n* Seasonings < $.25\n\nThis will make at least 8 bowls, making each serving approximately around $.80. The maximum would be $1/bowl, including the pasta or potato addition.

We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community.\n\n**The Details**\n\nOn July 18, 2012 we\u2019ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. \n\nThroughout our journey, we\u2019ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We\u2019ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.\n\n**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**\n\nAmerica is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this\u2014or at least challenge it in our own small way\u2014by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We\u2019ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life\u2019s big and little questions. We\u2019ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers\u2014virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.\n\n**The Conversation:**\n\nThis journey is a conversation. We\u2019ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We\u2019ll start here and see where it ripples out:\n\n*www.breakfastwithstrangers.com\n*www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers\n*twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals\n\n**The Outcome:**\n\nAt the end of our trip we\u2019ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book\u2019s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.\n\nThe most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.\nThanks for your consideration,\n\n**Matt & Courtney**\n* Breakfast with Strangers:50 Meals across America\n* Voicemail: (304) 50-MEALS\n* breakfastwithstrangers.com", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/ul48g/portland_couple_driving_across_the_usa_for_5/", "created_utc": 1338853499.0, "score": 80, "author": "BreakfastWStrangers", "num_comments": 84, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/ul48g/portland_couple_driving_across_the_usa_for_5/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Beef Stew Forever", "selftext": "EDIT: Formatting. \n\nThis is a really versatile recipe that freezes well and the serving cost is tiny. All ingredients cost me $23.98 and it made 12 generous servings.\n\n1 large yellow onion, diced\n\n4-5 stalks of celery, sliced thin\n\n4-5 small/medium russet potatoes, chopped into large chunks\n\n4-5 large carrots, sliced bite-size\n\n1 lb of beef stew meat or meat heavy beef trimmings (not just fatty scraps). \n\nMy trick is to dice the meat pretty small. This makes sure you get some beef in every spoonful, which makes the recipe seem more decadent. \n\n1 TBS minced garlic or 2 garlic cloves\n\nBeef bullion powder, beef stock, or broth to taste. I used about 8-10 cups but you really have to let your ancestors guide you on this because some cooks off as you simmer. \n\nPreferred seasonings\n\nFlour, cornstarch, or other thickener\n\n\nSet a large pot on a medium high heat, dry. Stew meat is fatty by nature, so just plop the meat into the pot and hear that awesome sizzle. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes to sear the outside. Turn your heat down to medium and add the onion, stir. \n\n\nWhen the onion is softened and translucent, add the celery and garlic and stir again. By this point the juices from the meat should be enough to generously coat the veggies. If it's not, add a little butter or a splash of water/broth to make sure the veggies don't stick to the pot.\n\n\nAdd 5 cups of your broth/stock/buillion mix and allow to cook on a simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. The beef should be tender but not falling apart. \n\n\nAdd your favorite seasonings. I use Lowry's seasoned salt (just a little, most broths and bullion are salty enough!) tons of black pepper, dried rosemary, and whatever else I'm feeling that day. Oregano, thyme, paprika, chili powder, and bay leaves all work well. Get creative with what you have around the house. \n\nAdd the carrots and more broth to look soupy. Simmer for half an hour more. \n\n\nAdd your potatoes and simmer or low boil for 25 more minutes or until the potatoes are *almost* as soft as you like them. \n\nMake a thickener by combining flour or cornstarch to cold water and mixing until smooth, like eggnog thick. Add about 1/4 cup to your soup and bring up the heat to medium and gently boil it for 5-10 minutes. \n\n\nEnjoy!! It's an old family recipe that I'm sure every midwestern American knows in some form.

{"title": "Plan Better = Eat Cheaper", "selftext": "I've read a few blogs about \"meal planning\" to cut down on grocery bills. The stay at home house wives that write these blogs suggest planning out every meal for every member of your family for a month. \n\nThat was a bit too much for me, but I had my husband sit down and help me plan out our meals for the next two weeks (our next pay day). We usually spend about $80 per week on groceries with random trips for things in between. I don't know how much the in between trips cost us. Today we bought absolutely everything we'll need for two weeks for $90.\n\nThe reason we spent so much more before planning our meals, was we shopped by getting what we knew we were out of and things that we thought we would cook/eat in the next few weeks. We always overestimated how much we needed on some things and underestimated on others. We ended up with expired meat, fruits, and vegetables (not tons, but I know we threw out something expired about once a week). This adds up. We bought things we never found time to cook, or never became appealing enough to eat (\"oh this yogurt will be so healthy!\").\n\nSo here is how you do it:\nStep 1: List what you already have in your fridge and pantry.\nStep 2: Use a calendar or something to write what you will eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and drink every day for however long. Try to choose things that you already have in your house. These need to be eaten first so they don't expire.\nStep 3: Go through your meals and make a list of the things you need to buy.\nStep 4: Only buy the things on your list!\n\nPro Tips: Use the unit price when comparing things to buy. You won't have to consider the price and the amount in the package. Whichever has the better unit price is the better deal. Also, the big sale displays don't show the unit price and are usually not better priced than what is on the aisle. I just avoid those and go to the products on the shelves.\n\nIf you plan to make three different meals that each call for a pound of meat. Don't buy 3 separate 1-lb units, buy the 3-lb unit. When you get home cut it into three chunks and put each in its own ziplock freezer bag. Unless the unit price is better for the 1-lb units. But that is unlikely.\n\nTry putting the fresher items near the beginning of your meal plan list. Have more salads early because lettuce don't keep very long.\n\nThis is the first time I've done this, but I'm fairly confident this will help our budget. I hope it helps you too!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/zb8al/plan_better_eat_cheaper/", "created_utc": 1346721777.0, "score": 79, "author": "NerdyGingerChick", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/zb8al/plan_better_eat_cheaper/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Roll the balls in a batter made of 1 tbsp water and a beaten egg, then in bread crumbs or shredded wheat (the latter preferred) and cook in deep fat. \n\nPersonally I would use panko for this and maybe add a bit of brown or dried mustard. \n***\n>One Egg Muffins\n\n2 cups flour\n\n4 tsp baking powder\n\n1/2 tsp salt\n\n2 tbsp melted butter\n\n3 tbsp sugar \n\n1 cup milk\n\n1 egg\n\nMix and sift dry ingredients.

Put it on medium high and pour in some oil. Once it warms up put the cut up chicken in. Douse it in soy sauce until it's relatively covered, if I had to guess it'll take a few tablespoons. Once the chicken is cooked set it aside and put some more oil in the pan. Dice your onion and add it to the pan with the the garlic and the peas/carrots, stirring frequently with your spatula.

Super easy, really flavorful, and honestly, it made my me feel\u00a0*way*\u00a0less sad.\n\nHere\u2019s the recipe in case anyone wants it:\n\n**Korean BBQ Chicken**\n\n* **2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs**\n* **1/2cup low-sodium soy sauce**\n* **2 tbsp honey (or sweetener or brown sugar or white sugar)**\n* **2tbsp sesame oil**\n* **2tbsp gochujang**\u00a0\n* **1tbps gochugaru**\u00a0\n* **6cloves garlic (it's never too much)**\u00a0\n* **1 tbsp fresh ginger**\n* **2 tbsp rice vinegar**\n* **\u00bd an Asian pear, peeled and chopped**\n* **1 medium yellow onion, chopped**\n* **2 green onions, chopped**\n* **1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds**\n\n**How to make it:**\n\n1. Blend everything together for the marinade, dump it over the chicken, and let it sit for\u00a0**at least an hour**\u00a0but for real at least 8-12 hours - it makes a difference.\n2. Cook it however you want\u2014grill it, pan-sear it, or roast it in the oven at a high temp\u00a0until it\u2019s caramelized and people come down to see wtf the delicious smell is.

{"title": "3 Month Prep Advice", "selftext": "Hey Everyone!\n\n  \nLooking for advice on what to order in bulk for meals (Possibly also from where)  \nI am going on a tighter budget for the next 3 months and I am trying to push my main meal cost below 5$ per day. I usually have a light breakfast and evening dinner. I consume around 1,3k cal daily (I have a small snack mid-day but I am not including it in this budget).\n\nAlso, a large factor is that I am splitting a living space with 2 more people and I operate at odd times so I can only cook the evening meal and the breakfast I need to prep before or I need to be able to make it without cooking or boiling anything. If possible I also would like to spend as little time as possible with pots and pans as I have to do it in a different building and I have to take all the tooling with me which takes a while. I do have a kettle to boil water in the room and I am thinking about getting a sandwich maker.\n\nI was looking at MREs but they seem out of budget. The readywise emergency packs seemed great but they package multiple servings in one pack (Like 6 servings in 1 pack) so I do not know what to do when I open 1 pack and eat 1 serving per day. How can I keep it from spoiling after opening.\n\nSome solutions I have already been using and thinking of re-using. For breakfast, instant noodles work well and I can warm them before the night and place them in a thermoss so it solves the cooking issue.  \nFor cooking I get frozen french fries from Walmart (the cheap 5lb packs) and the big chicken nugget packs for meat that they have.  \nAlso rice works great and I have been eyeing the large packs.  \nBread with cheese seems also very good. You can get American slices in bulk and bread is cheap enough to pull some tasty dinners.  \nI do have a large freezer in the room so that is very good and I have unlimited access to filtered water.\n\nDo you have any tips about what and possibly from where I could buy that would also work very well for this situation?\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1ijg2rs/3_month_prep_advice/", "created_utc": 1738882577.0, "score": 9, "author": "Gvido_XD", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1ijg2rs/3_month_prep_advice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Meal for whole family under 15$", "selftext": "I grew up in a household with my uncle and his high school sweetheart turned wife -Karla. Karla was a Mexican immigrant who came to the United States with her family when she was only 6 and along with them came their authentic Mexican recipes. When she married my uncle and moved in let\u2019s just say the dinner time game changed going from basic meals to restaurant quality meals.\nOne meal in particular she would make that my whole family called a favorite was her tortilla soup, the smell alone while she was cooking would make our mouths drool and even though she\u2019d make a large pot -it was always gone by the next day. \nKarla\u2019s cooking was an art, nothing she cooked was ever quick as most meals she would start cooking the day before sometimes even two depending on the meal. Typically she would start by slowly drawing out flavors of all the fresh ingredients, for example instead of using chili powder she would use fresh or dried whole chilis, instead of cinnamon powder she would use fresh cinnamon sticks, instead of store bought tortillas she would make her own and don\u2019t get me started on her tamales. \nOnce I came of age and moved out of the house it\u2019s Karla\u2019s cooking I missed above all, specifically her tortilla soup. \nI was on the phone with another aunt one day and as we were talking she brought up karla leading me to mentioned how much I missed her cooking and her tortilla soup  -this is when my aunt told me she too loves it and actually had asked Karla for the recipe, when Karla came back with the recipe my aunt realized that there was no way she was going to make that (it was too much work apparently) so she asked Karla to give her a quick /less cooking the better recipe. \nKarla came back with this:\n\n2 cans diced fire roasted tomatoes \n2 cans corn\n2 can black beans \n2 cans mild (or hot whatever preference) diced green chilis \nTaco seasoning \n3 cups Chicken bouillon broth (the cubed or powdered works just the same) \n**you could use chicken broth as well **\n2 pound boneless skinless chicken breast (or thigh) \n***you could used any leftover chicken you already have as well as a rotisserie chicken just remove from bone***\n\n\nYou can cook this in a slow cooker if you have the time and patience, or you could cook in a regular pot over the stove \n\nIf you cook in a slow cooker you want to rinse and then season your chicken with the taco seasoning on both sides and heavily (heavy because the seasoning helps flavor your broth of the soup -if you don\u2019t do enough you can always add more to the soup at the end and taste until it\u2019s to your liking) \nAnd then place the chicken on bottom of the slow cooker pot, dump all the can goods on top, add your broth, then cook on low for 6 hours or high for 3.5 \n\nIf you cook in pot you must first cook your chicken separately, do the same by seasoning the chicken with taco seasoning heavily on both sides and then cook through until no longer pink, once cooked fully the chicken should be easy to shred into pieces \n\nAdd all canned ingredients into a pot over medium heat, add broth, add cooked chicken and heat until about to boil. \n\nYou can freeze leftover soup for later, you can also up the recipe to yield more by adding more of each can just remember to up the broth\nIf you want a thick /creamy consistency you can add masa flour -just be sure to take the masa and mix in bowl with cold water to form a paste before adding to hot soup a-adding masa to hot soup directly will clump \nMasa is what is used to make tortillas so adding masa also gives the soup a nice corn flavor \nThough I\u2019ve never used flour to thicken I\u2019m sure you could that as well \n\nIf you use left over chicken just shred it and then season with taco seasoning before adding to your pot of ingredients \n\nI have no right amount of taco seasoning to add to soup as I just add and taste and add and taste until the flavor is where I want it \n\nThis meal has been a staple when I\u2019m on a budget but wanting to eat healthy, I even remember always making it when I was living in a house with 5 of my friends and we all where broke and hungry - it was always the perfect thing to make to feed a lot of people with no money. It\u2019s filling, it\u2019s healthy, and it\u2019s so good. \n\nI personally like to top it with cilantro, lime, avocado, cheese and tortilla chips -but when your on a budget those aren\u2019t always an option and it\u2019s just as good without the toppings \n\nMy aunt Karla used to hand make the tortilla strips that went on top and I\u2019ll admit they where a lot better than store bought tortilla chips only bc they where so much thicker and crunchier so they stayed crunchy despite them sitting in soup broth but over time I\u2019ve learned to put the cheese on top the soup and THEN put the crushed tortilla chips on top the cheese as it saves the chips from soaking in the broth \n\nTo be fair my aunt Karla\u2019s simplified recipe named every individual seasoning needed for the soup but the day I was broke and wanting to make it but didn\u2019t have the $ to buy all the seasoning I picked up a taco seasoning and read the back of the box and realized the taco seasoning contained all of what I needed (plus a couple more seasonings which only added flavor) \n\nTo me it\u2019s hard to wrap my head around how such flavor comes from canned vegetables and chicken -it\u2019s not exactly Karla\u2019s soup but it\u2019s close enough to satisfy my nostalgia\n\nHonestly it\u2019s so close it makes me wonder why Karla spent days cooking when all she had to do was dump in some canned goods and chicken  lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gu1fj1/meal_for_whole_family_under_15/", "created_utc": 1731924150.0, "score": 31, "author": "Amandakayayy", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gu1fj1/meal_for_whole_family_under_15/", "html_title": ""}

Prepare the Ribs:\n\nRemove the thin membrane from the back of the ribs to enhance tenderness and flavor absorption. To do this, slide a butter knife under the membrane at one end, lift it, and peel it off using a paper towel for grip. \u200b\u200b\n\nWash the ribs under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.\n\nCut the ribs into individual pieces.\n\n\n\n2. Initial Cooking:\n\nIn a large pan, add 1\u00bd cups of water and bring it to a boil.\n\nAdd the ribs to the boiling water, cover the pan with a lid, and cook for 10 minutes. This step helps to tenderize the meat.\n\n\n\n3. Saut\u00e9ing:\n\nAfter 10 minutes, remove the lid and drain any remaining water from the pan.\n\nAdd 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan and heat over medium heat.\n\nAdd the minced ginger, garlic, and onion to the pan. Saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 2 minutes.\n\nStir in the cumin powder, coriander powder, salt, black pepper, and paprika. Mix well to coat the ribs evenly.\n\n\n\n4. Simmering:\n\nCook the ribs uncovered for an additional 3 minutes, allowing the spices to meld with the meat.\n\nAdd \u00bd cup of water to the pan, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 15 minutes. This slow cooking ensures the ribs become tender and flavorful.\n\n\n\n5. Adding Sauces:\n\nRemove the lid and stir in 1 tablespoon of mustard and 4 tablespoons of chipotle barbecue sauce.\n\nCook uncovered for another 2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and coat the ribs thoroughly.\n\n\n\n6. Serving:\n\nTransfer the ribs to a serving platter.\n\nGarnish with freshly chopped parsley.\n\nServe hot, accompanied by your choice of sides.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Removing the membrane from the ribs is crucial for achieving a tender texture and allowing the flavors to penetrate the meat effectively. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n", "url": "https://youtu.be/RP_bZ8CLVw8?si=hmflaShKwSn1a3l7", "created_utc": 1731672841.0, "score": 2, "author": "Special_Struggle_336", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1grv058/tender_pork_ribs_recipe_spicy_chipotle_bbq_flavor/", "html_title": "Tender Pork Ribs Recipe: Spicy Chipotle BBQ Flavor | Easy Step-by-Step Guide - YouTube"}

You want a few gentle bubbles breaking the surface when you lift the lid. If it's bubbling more than that, turn the temp down a notch and give it a stir before putting the lid back on. If it's already on the lowest temperature and bubbling a lot, leave the lid off, and give it a stir to release some of the heat. If it's not bubbling at all, creep up the heat half a notch, slap on the lid, and check in another 5 minutes. Ideally, you want it to simmer at that rate for 10-15 minutes, or until the lentils are soft and have kind of lost their shape. The handy thing about this recipe is that it's very forgiving to a bit of overcooking.\n\nTurn off the heat and/or remove from the burner. Finish seasoning by adding lime juice and soy sauce, stirring and tasting. This is also the time to decide if you want or need to add more of any seasoning. Before adding more salt, try a bit more lime juice (or other acid) and taste it again. If it still lacks salt after that, go for it. You can also adjust seasoning by the serving, using salt, pepper, hot sauce, etc.\n\n\n\nMakes 4 big bowls or 6 smaller ones.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gl9e2f/coconut_lentil_soup/", "created_utc": 1730927816.0, "score": 12, "author": "Disastrous-Wing699", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gl9e2f/coconut_lentil_soup/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Beef Heart", "selftext": "Due to the price, I don't eat a lot of beef, but when I'm craving some, I grab a hunk of beef heart. Strongly flavoured meats of any kind are not my bag - especially organ meats - but heart is different. Like the other 'typical' meats we buy, the heart is mostly muscle, with a bit of fat and connective tissue. And beef heart, aside from being cheap, is just about the best thing for nice, tender slices, perfect for sandwiches, stroganoff, or tossing on a bowl of rice.\n\nMy method uses an electric pressure cooker (Instant Pot) for speedy results, but the main takeaway must be that heart needs a stew or braise-type preparation to adequately tenderize and break down connective tissue. I like to prepare mine relatively plain for use in other dishes. I also use a heart portion, because that's how my grocer sells it. Look for one that's mostly 'meat', with little fat or other stuff, especially the first few times.\n\nStep 1: Liberally season the surface of the meat with salt, and any other seasoning of your choice, approximately 1 tsp per pound. Let this sit for 30-45 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Mix 1/2 C hot water with 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce and 1/2 C diced onion (frozen or fresh). Pour into the pot of your pressure cooker. Pop the heart on top, close the lid and seal it. Set it to pressure cook on low for 1.5 hours (90 minutes). Walk away.\n\nStep 3: When the buzzer goes off, turn off the cooker. Release pressure as you see fit. I usually just leave it alone until the button goes down. Remove the meat, trim and slice.

{"title": "[Long-form] Thai Red Curry w/ Rice and a glass of milk. 7 meals, $3.23 each (in terms of what I actually used; bought ingredients in bulk)", "selftext": "Image: https://i.imgur.com/WFoSxfZ.png\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I recently moved in together. Previously we spent a lot of time at each other's apartments- it was hard to shop or cook in bulk bc we had no idea how many nights we'd be at each other's apartments. Plus, travel time.\n\nSo we got too much takeout. This was our #1 expense, so we're starting to cook in bulk now that we can.\n\n**With that: we just made Thai Red Curry w/ rice in bulk, along with a glass of milk. We got 7 meals out of it, and factoring in ingredient prices, it cost $3.23 per meal. Not to mention leftover ingredients.**\n\n# The Recipe:\n\nHomemade Red Curry Paste: https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-red-curry-paste/\n\nThai Red Curry w/ Rice (using this paste): https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-red-curry-with-chicken/\n\nWe used substitutes/adjusted quantities as we saw fit, shown below.\n\n# Ingredient Price/Use Breakdown\n\nThai Red Curry Paste\n\n|Ingredient|Purchase Price|Quantity Purchased|Quantity Used|Cost of Use|Left over|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|Thai Red Curry Peppers|$4|300\\*|30|$0.40|260 peppers\n|Lemongrass|$2|2 sticks|2 sticks|$2|N/A|\n|Ginger|$2|1 giant head|2 tbsp (10%)\\*|$0.20|18 tbsp\n|Fish Paste (Anchovy)|$3|3 tbsp|1 tbsp|$1|2 tbsp\n|Garlic|$1|1 head/12 cloves|8 cloves|$0.66|4 cloves\n|Cumin|$1|1.5 oz|1 tsp ~ 0.1 oz|$0.07|1.4 oz\n|Kinh Gioi (Vietnamese Lemon Mint)****|$2.50|A bagful|1/8 bag*|$0.31|7/8 bag\n|Red Shallots|$2.25|2|2|$2.25|N/A\n|Lime (for zesting)|$0.67|1 lime|1/4 of lime skin|$0.17**|3/4 lime skin**\n|**TOTAL**|**$18.42**|**N/A**|**N/A**|**$7.06**|**A LOT**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThai Red Curry:\n\n|Ingredient|Purchase Price|Quantity Purchased|Quantity Used|Cost of Use|Left over|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|Thai Red Curry Paste (above)|$18.42***|N/A|N/A|$7.06|A LOT\n|Vegetable Oil|$4|48 fl oz = 96 tbsp|3 tbsp|$0.13|93 tbsp\n|Vegetable Broth|$2.79|4 cups|1 cup|$0.70|3 cups\n|Coconut Milk|$3.59|400 mL|400 mL|$3.59|N/A\n|Lime (for zesting)|$0.67|1 lime|3/4 of lime skin|$0.50**|1/4 lime skin**\n|White Sugar|$3.79|4 lbs = 192 tbsp|2 tbsp|$0.04|190 tbsp\n|Fish Sauce|$8.99|24 fl oz = 48 tbsp|1 tbsp|$0.19|47 tbsp\n|Boneless Chicken Thighs|$9|2 lbs|1 lb|$4.50|1 lb\n|Pumpkin (cubed)|$5|15 oz|5 oz|$1.67|10 oz\n|Green beans|$2.50|1 bagful|1/8 bag*|$0.31|7/8 bag\n|Basil (spice)|$1|0.62 oz ~ 2.5 tbsp|1 tbsp|$0.40|1.5 tbsp\n|**Total**|**$59.75**|**N/A**|**N/A**|**$19.09**|**A LOT**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n|Ingredient|Purchase Price|Quantity Purchased|Quantity Used|Cost of Use|Left Over\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|2% Milk|$2.79|0.5 gal = 8 cups|3 cups|$1.05|5 cups\n|Almond Milk|$3.29|0.5 gal = 8 cups|4 cups|$1.65|4 cups\n|Basmati Rice|$20|20 lbs ~ 50 cups|2 cups|$0.80|48 cups\n|**Total**|**$26.08**|**N/A**|**N/A**|**$3.50**|**A LOT**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Totals/Costs\n\nI spent $85.83 in bulk materials, and it's so misleading. Because I won't have to buy most of this stuff anytime soon.\n\nAll this made 7 Meals of Thai Red Curry w/ Rice & a glass of milk each time.\n\n- Cost of 7 Meals: $22.59\n\n- **Cost of 1 Meal: $3.23**\n\nNot to mention an entire freaking pantry of leftovers. \n\nThe Thai restaurants near us would charge $18 for 1 order of this (VHCOL area). It wouldn't be nearly as nutritious- no pumpkin/green beans/kinh gioi or 1/2 the spices. Absolute best case scenario, 1 order is 1.5 meals (leftovers). Including the cost of milk from home, we're looking at $92.70 for 7 meals of less nutritious takeout. And 0 leftover ingredients after.\n\nSo we had a much more nutritious version of this meal for 3.5 days & saved at least $70.11 for 7 meals on the way. Plus we have plenty of leftover ingredients. All it took was a grocery run & 3 hours of work.\n\nI will save several hundreds of dollars if I continue using the items I bought in bulk.\n\nHope this helps someone save money or eat healthier!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\* = estimate\n\n\\** = not to mention the entire inside of the lime\n\n\\***With MANY leftovers to make again\n\n\\**** The recipe calls for cilantro, but my fianc\u00e9e has the cilantro/soap gene, so we used kinh gioi as a substitute.

{"title": "Flavorful Chicken Crockpot Recipe with Rice", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been making this meal for a while and today realized how cheap it is, so I wanted to share! It\u2019s tasty + a good source of carbs and protein. \n\nThe recipe I use requires some base ingredients, but they last a while and can be used for other recipes. This recipe is also stupid easy, not lot of work, and is very easy to clean up. This meal can be anywhere from 3-5 servings depending on your serving size and can be put in the freezer. This recipe can also be doubled with the same cook time. Recipe below! \n\n- large pan\n- crockpot\n\nIngredients that need to be purchased every time:\n\nChicken breast (2 pack) - $9\nOnion (chopped) - $1.50\nGreen pepper (chopped) - $1\nWater (4 cups) \n\nBase/investment ingredients: \n\nCholula (7-8 blobs, or to taste) - $4\nTony\u2019s Creole Seasoning - $3\nGarlic Powder (2 tbsp, or to taste) - $1.50\nBetter than Bouillon - chicken (2tbsp, ish) - $5\nWhite Rice - $1 \nAvocado oil/olive oil (2 tbsp)- $10? \n\n1. Chop green pepper and onion\n2. Set a large pan to medium heat. The heat will stay here throughout the recipe\n3. While the pan is heating up cover both sides of each chicken breast with the creole seasoning. Season generously \n4. Put the 2tbsp of oil into the pan\n5. Once the oil is heated up, put the chicken into the pan. Cook until golden brown and then flip\n6. Put the chicken in the crockpot once golden brown on both sides \n7. Put the chopped green pepper and onions into the pan. Do not clean the pan prior to this\n8. Saut\u00e9 until tender\n9. Put the cooked green peppers and onions into the crockpot\n10. Pour 4 cups of water into the pan and add the better than bouillon. Let it dissolve fully\n11. Add the cholula and garlic powder to the pan and stir until mixed\n12. Dump the water mixture into the crockpot\n13. Cover the crockpot and cook on low for 6-10 hours. \n14. Take the chicken out of the crockpot and shred it. Throw it back in the crockpot after shredding\n15. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes on warm or low to allow the chicken to sit with the seasonings. This step isn\u2019t required, but is recommended\n16. Crockpot chicken done! \n17. Cook white rice following the directions. Use as much rice as you want to eat for the recipe or for that meal, depending on if you\u2019re cooking all the rice at once\n18. Portion and serve\n\nI typically keep the chicken and rice in separate containers so the rice doesn\u2019t soak up all of the liquid from the chicken prep. You can keep the liquid or strain it. I keep the liquid in the mixture as it adds to the flavor and gives it a stew-like feeling. \n\nI want to note that I don\u2019t measure the ingredients anymore so it\u2019s all a guess!

{"title": "For anyone nostalgic for school lunch", "selftext": "Total cost for 2 in Florida: $3.69  \nTotal calories: Approximately 1000 or 500/pp I didn't weigh or measure everything exactly but I've left some room for margin of error.  \nTotal cook time: About 10 minutes\n\nAll of my pricing does come from my local Wal-Mart in Florida.\n\nThe lower cost does take into account one pantry item which is flour, we were given a large bag of flour so I didn't factor that into our total cost which was $3.69. For the recipe I only used one tablespoon of flour so even if you needed to buy flour a 2 pound bag , at my Wal-Mart in Florida, is only $1.32. With only using a tablespoon the cost is nearly free.\n\nThe first time I made this I had just had two teeth pulled and couldn't eat hard foods and I was feeling extremely nostalgic for the school lunch of turkey, gravy, and mashed potatoes. We use chicken instead of turkey but it hits the spot all the same. It's super cheap and easy to make and has been entered into my husband and I's cheap and easy weeknight dinners. Also my tablespoon amounts are approximations, I used a large dinner spoon tonight.\n\nIngredients:  \n1 can of cooked chicken (Sams Club 6 pack $2/can)  \n1 pack of instant mashed potatoes (Wal-Mart Idahoan Buttery Golden Selects $1.44)  \n1 tablespoon flour  \n0.5 tablespoon Better than Bouillon chicken ($.13/tablespoon)  \n1 cup hot water  \n1 tablespoon butter (Wal-Mart $.12/tablespoon)\n\nCooking:\n\nMix a half tablespoon Better than Bouillon into a cup of very hot water, set aside. I use a liquid measuring cup so I can easily pour it into my roux mix.\n\nMake a simple chicken gravy starting with a roux by melting one tablespoon of butter in a pan over medium high heat, then add one tablespoon of flour and whisk and cook together until flour is cooked and slightly browned. Slowly add broth and whisk until no lumps, let gravy cook while continuing to whisk gently until it reaches desired consistency and taste for seasoning.\n\nAdd drained chicken to gravy and let heat through\n\nWhile chicken is heating up in gravy, make your instant mash potatoes according to directions on the package. The ones I had were a just add water.\n\nPile it all up in a bowl and enjoy!!\n\nSome footnotes:\n\nYou can make this recipe even faster/easier with instant gravy mix but we didn't have it and I can whip up a homemade gravy pretty quick. If you do use instant gravy mix it takes the cost up to around $5 total depending on brand.  \nI also added Meat Church Holy Voodoo but that's just because I really like it and I put it in literally everything I eat. It did make my gravy a little too salty so I added some plain water to the gravy and cooked it a little longer. I originally made two cups of chicken stock but I only ended up using one but better to have too much than too little!  \nThe Better than Bouillon instructions say to add a teaspoon to 8oz water but I don't find it to be flavorful enough, especially for gravy so I like to add more.

Simmer the chickpeas over low heat for about 30 minutes or until very tender.\n\nToast the bread: Set your oven rack about 6 inches beneath the boiler and set the broiler to high. While the chickpeas cook, tear some hearty crusty bread into a little larger than bite-size pieces and arrange them on a large sheet. Drizzle the bread with extra virgin olive oil, toss to coat and arrange them so the pieces are crust side down. Broil briefly, maybe a minute or so just until the bread turns golden brown. Watch carefully, as the bread can go from golden brown to burnt quickly!\n\nSaute the onions and garlic: Add 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a medium non-stick skillet set over medium heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions and garlic, a dash of kosher salt, cumin, coriander, and paprika. Cook over medium heat, tossing regularly until the onions are tender and translucent.\n\nSeason the chickpea stew: When the chickpeas are ready, transfer the onion and garlic mixture to the saucepan with the chickpeas. Add 1 tablespoon harissa paste, a big pinch of kosher salt, juice from 1 lemon, chopped parsley, and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning.\n\nServe: Slice the remaining lemon into wedges. Prepare serving bowls and place a few pieces of toasted bread on the bottom.

Remove from heat and slice into strips or bite-sized pieces.\n\n4. **Combine Everything:**\n   - In the same skillet used for the turkey, add the drained peas and sliced turkey back to the pan.\n   - Add the drained cooked orzo to the skillet with the turkey and peas.\n   - Stir in the green pesto until everything is well combined and heated through.\n   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the Turkey Schnitzel Orzo with Green Pesto hot, garnished with additional chopped chives or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese if desired.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1dydpn1/seeing_as_i_have_more_left_over_orzo_and_green/", "created_utc": 1720457337.0, "score": 4, "author": "tharuka8", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1dydpn1/seeing_as_i_have_more_left_over_orzo_and_green/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chaufa (Peruvian fried rice)", "selftext": "Healthy, tasty, easy, cheap. It's usually made with some kind of seafood, but shredded chicken or chopped meat works too. This recipe makes 4 hefty servings. There are two of us, so it lasts 2 days. This meal can be made in the time it takes to cook the rice.\n\nIngredients: 1 lb protein, 8 servings (half cup) almost any combo of 2-3 different chopped vegetables, 1.5 cups long grain rice, 2 med onions or 4-6 cloves garlic, spices (see below). Optional: up to 4 eggs, 1 carrot, 1 stalk celery.\n\nStart rice. Heat oil in pot, add raw rice, saute stirring constantly until the kitchen smells like popcorn, add the water. This flavors the rice and makes it fluffy.\n\nHeat oil in large, high-sided pan. Saute chopped onion or garlic (and chopped carrot and celery, if you have them).\n\nAdd, cook, and remove the protein (could be canned salmon, canned tuna, pkg frozen clams, chicken, hamburger, fresh or frozen fish filets, baby shrimp, etc). If it's chicken or fish, saute it whole and chop it later, to avoid hassling with raw chicken or fish.\n\nVegetables. If they're fresh or if they're canned diced tomatoes, stir-fry them in the pan now. If they're frozen, zap in microwave and add at end. Bell peppers are good, only slightly milder than the ones Peruvians use.\n\nEggs. If you have too little protein, or if you just like eggs, whisk and add them to the pan now, stirring and cutting until you have dry pieces among the veggies.\n\nTurn the heat down to lowest level and add to the pan any zapped vegs, the chopped protein, and the rice. Add seasoning (Adobo or salt, achiote/annato or turmeric for color, parsley, a hint of cayenne, cumin if you used salt instead of adobo). If the protein is fish, you can be completely American like us and add 4 ozs tarter sauce. Mix it thoroughly.\n\nServe. We use bowls, Peruvians use plates.\n\nLeftovers, if there were only 2 of you, put a lid on the pan and stick the whole thing in the fridge, ready to reheat tomorrow, when it will taste even better.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1d3tw8c/chaufa_peruvian_fried_rice/", "created_utc": 1717037392.0, "score": 13, "author": "Building_a_life", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1d3tw8c/chaufa_peruvian_fried_rice/", "html_title": ""}

Be ready for the price, it's double the cost of ground beef - $10-11 a pound. It's worth it for how thinly sliced it is, much thinner than what I could do at home. \n\nVeg: I've done bok choy, I've done an onion, I've done no veg.

I guess I was expecting it to be lower since I do all the cooking and baking and really hardly ever buy any processed foods or ready-made meals. And I try to buy in bulk (rice, flour etc) and plan my meals around the weekly specials at the grocery stores. \n\nSo I am curious if anyone else has broken down their food spending?

I'm currently without SSI and trying to get it back, but mean while I've been using some creativity to get by with food. \n\nSpaghetti and soups will be your best friend, Safeway often has good deals on meats that are a big cut. So you can make a big batch of soup that can last you two weeks for a single person, if stored right. I have rice and oats as a last ditch effort plus some protein powder if I can get it. Milk powder is another great substitute if you can't really store milk for to long. Frozen fruit (while a bit expensive) mixed with well trail mix and some yogurt makes a good breakfast and you can stretch it by only having individual parts instead of combining to make it last longer. It may not be as good as olive oil, fat at Safeway is a dollar per pound and it is EBT approved. So you can cook with that if you can't get any cooking oil (just learned this recently actually) make sure to give them a days notice though. I do buy energy drinks though which isn't smart on my end but I run on it, though I can make a single can last 2-3 days.

{"title": "Got a surprisingly good stew recipe from Townsends", "selftext": "I've been looking into historical cooking stuff, as a curiosity. And I tried the recipe from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WjvTGkRzZM&t=99s), about recipes formulated for working-class families who needed to stretch their money out. The recipes are pretty vague, by their nature, but I ended up using:\n\n* 2 lbs pork stew meat (if I scaled the recipe up, I might have used a whole pork shoulder for an even cheaper per-pound cost), cut into small pieces\n* 1 large onion, peeled and diced\n* about 1 Tbsp minced garlic, or 3-4 cloves minced\n* 2 large carrots, diced\n* 1 turnip, peeled and diced\n* 2 yukon gold potatoes (or any potatoes that are convenient), peeled and diced\n* 6 quarts water\n* chicken/pork/beef bouillon, optional (adds to the stock)\n* 2 Cups whole oats, ground into a powder\n* 1-2 Bay Leaves, optional\n* dried Thyme or Parsley, optional\n* Salt and Pepper, to taste\n\nWhile the historical recipe was pretty simple, I added a few steps that felt more common in a modern kitchen, and would add a bit of extra flavor.\n\n1. Add any fat trimmings from your meat to a large pot over medium heat, and let the fat render out. Once the fat's been rendered, you can pull the pieces out, or leave them in the stew.\n2. Liberally season the meat with salt and pepper, add it to the pot, and brown in batches. Remove everything, and set it aside for now.\n3. Add your onions, and cook for 3-4 minutes, until transluscent and softened. Take a bit of time to scrape up the fond from the meat. Add your garlic during the last minute, and cook everything together until the garlic is fragrant.\n4. Add the meat back in, along with your water and bouillon (if using) and bring everything to a boil. Add any herbs or spices you're using, if you wish. Reduce to a simmer, and let it sit for 45 minutes. This will infuse the water with proteins from the meat, and add richness and flavor to your stock. \n5. Add your root vegetables (carrots, turnips, potatoes), and your oat flour. Stir to break up any lumps in the oats, but this isn't necessary. Cook for another 15 minutes, and then taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\nThe oats will thicken the liquid slightly, giving it a lot of body. I used some things I already had in my pantry, like oats. But overall I made this for about $12, and got 16 cups of stew (about 8 meals).\n\nIf I were to review the recipe, I could add maybe twice as many vegetables to bulk up the stew without much more to the total cost. But it's a really flavorful stew, that's rich in protein and quite filling (especially with bread).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1cbhpei/got_a_surprisingly_good_stew_recipe_from_townsends/", "created_utc": 1713910560.0, "score": 26, "author": "CrazyPlato", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1cbhpei/got_a_surprisingly_good_stew_recipe_from_townsends/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What's the best way to order pizza?", "selftext": "I went to Domino's today and got the extravaganza. It wasn't overly expensive but I realized the pizza wasn't really more coated with toppings despite there being more toppings on the order. I feel like when you get multiple toppings they just put less of each one on the pizza and it ends up containing the same total volume of toppings as there would be with fewer number of toppings.\n\nHas anyone done the math? Is there some optimum formula where you can maximize topping content while minimizing cost?\n\nAlso (as an aside) how do they get away with charging more per topping if they don't provide the same amount of that topping? If I order a 3 topping pizza, for instance, I should get the same number of pepperonis, peppers and onions as they would put on a one topping pizza with each of those toppings. If not, they shouldn't charge per topping; they should perhaps charge by total mass of all the toppings instead of the number of different toppings (the quantity of which is determined by the person making the pizza).\n\nIt doesn't take any additional time for the pizza maker to put a different topping on the pizza since they're literally just in bins in front of them. Therefore it's simply a matter of food volume. If I'm paying more for another topping, I should be getting more total food. The pizza should actually weigh more.

I also added about half a teaspoon of MSG towards the end with the stock and lentils, but this is totally optional.\n\n1. Start by frying your onions on a medium heat for around 6-8 minutes until slightly brown, then turn it up to medium-high and add your mince. Brown that for about 5 minutes and then add the spices, chopped tomatoes, and garlic. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. \n2. While it's browning, add your tomato puree to your beef stock and dissolve. Set this aside for a minute while the spices, garlic and tomatoes are cooking. \n3. Add your drained and rinsed lentils and the beef stock-tomato puree mixture. Stir, bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the spinach and let it wilt. The stew is ready, so serve up with some rice, crumbled feta and a crack of black pepper.\n\n\nI've priced it up, but haven't included staples that I already have in, like garlic, all the spices, tomato puree, and rice.

This allows you to have them ready for future meals instead of cooking them on the spot.\n\nFor carbohydrates, I recommend preparing staples like rice and pasta. These can be boiled in about 30 minutes and then microwaved when needed.\n\nFor proteins, although they can be cooked and stored, it's important to note that their taste may differ slightly from when they're freshly prepared. If you choose to meal prep proteins, aim to cook enough for 1-3 days at a time. This approach ensures convenience without compromising too much on taste.\n\n# Breakfast Meals\n\n# 1.

However,  it's a small variety and I want to teach him more things, but most  likely his parents will eat any leftovers leading to him having no food  (and at the moment he barely gets a meal a day, he is actually  malnourished while his parents just eat out during the day without him  getting food). So what I thought was a container that isn't see through,  and has a divider horizontally instead of vertically, where it looks  like there's one food on top (which will be stuff he makes that they  won't eat and just leave there) and underneath will be whatever else.  It'll help give variety to his meals so he can eat healthily and he can  have just more food, cause the stuff they don't like isn't the most  scalable for meal prep (at least on a budget).

I place 4 eggs throughout the pan and cover with a lid to allow the egg to steam within the tomato sauce.

I am not in an ideal situation but am determined to come up with the money I need and make this work. Does anyone have any other affordable ideas for food to eat? I am especially interested in snack ideas because those tend to be more expensive. I have a Dollar Tree next to me and am thinking my best bet is to buy snacks from there. I know food banks and pantries exist as well, but feel bad about utilizing those resources because I know, even with my current situation, I still have a lot more disposable income and am much more privileged than a lot of other folks.\n\nI appreciate any ideas y'all have!\n\nEDIT: Some of y'all have given me great ideas that I unfortunately can't utilize or would be very difficult for me to utilize. Appliances would require space in my bedroom to use them, plus the ability to wash dishes, which I'd have to do in my bathroom sink, since the counterspace and sink in my kitchen are unavailable. I'd love some suggestions that only use a microwave!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/14cc02e/alternatives_to_cooking/", "created_utc": 1687066144.0, "score": 12, "author": "wildrmind", "num_comments": 42, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/14cc02e/alternatives_to_cooking/", "html_title": ""}

Eventually, I figured out that if I want to take lunches to work and save money, or have non-takeout dinners (and save money), I should probably be cooking stuff and putting those skills to use lol.\u00a0This week I made a bunch of different things, but the\u00a0**Korean BBQ Chicken**\u00a0was definitely the best one. Super easy, really flavorful, and honestly, it made my me feel\u00a0*way*\u00a0less sad.\n\nHere\u2019s the recipe in case anyone wants it:\n\n**Korean BBQ Chicken**\n\n* **2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs**\n* **1/2cup low-sodium soy sauce**\n* **2 tbsp honey (or sweetener or brown sugar or white sugar)**\n* **2tbsp sesame oil**\n* **2tbsp gochujang**\u00a0\n* **1tbps gochugaru**\u00a0\n* **6cloves garlic (it's never too much)**\u00a0\n* **1 tbsp fresh ginger**\n* **2 tbsp rice vinegar**\n* **\u00bd an Asian pear, peeled and chopped**\n* **1 medium yellow onion, chopped**\n* **2 green onions, chopped**\n* **1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds**\n\n**How to make it:**\n\n1. Blend everything together for the marinade, dump it over the chicken, and let it sit for\u00a0**at least an hour**\u00a0but for real at least 8-12 hours - it makes a difference.\n2. Cook it however you want\u2014grill it, pan-sear it, or roast it in the oven at a high temp\u00a0until it\u2019s caramelized and people come down to see wtf the delicious smell is.

I usually have a light breakfast and evening dinner. I consume around 1,3k cal daily (I have a small snack mid-day but I am not including it in this budget).\n\nAlso, a large factor is that I am splitting a living space with 2 more people and I operate at odd times so I can only cook the evening meal and the breakfast I need to prep before or I need to be able to make it without cooking or boiling anything. If possible I also would like to spend as little time as possible with pots and pans as I have to do it in a different building and I have to take all the tooling with me which takes a while. I do have a kettle to boil water in the room and I am thinking about getting a sandwich maker.\n\nI was looking at MREs but they seem out of budget. The readywise emergency packs seemed great but they package multiple servings in one pack (Like 6 servings in 1 pack) so I do not know what to do when I open 1 pack and eat 1 serving per day. How can I keep it from spoiling after opening.\n\nSome solutions I have already been using and thinking of re-using. For breakfast, instant noodles work well and I can warm them before the night and place them in a thermoss so it solves the cooking issue.  \nFor cooking I get frozen french fries from Walmart (the cheap 5lb packs) and the big chicken nugget packs for meat that they have.  \nAlso rice works great and I have been eyeing the large packs.  \nBread with cheese seems also very good. You can get American slices in bulk and bread is cheap enough to pull some tasty dinners.  \nI do have a large freezer in the room so that is very good and I have unlimited access to filtered water.\n\nDo you have any tips about what and possibly from where I could buy that would also work very well for this situation?\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1ijg2rs/3_month_prep_advice/", "created_utc": 1738882577.0, "score": 8, "author": "Gvido_XD", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1ijg2rs/3_month_prep_advice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Meal for whole family under 15$", "selftext": "I grew up in a household with my uncle and his high school sweetheart turned wife -Karla. Karla was a Mexican immigrant who came to the United States with her family when she was only 6 and along with them came their authentic Mexican recipes. When she married my uncle and moved in let\u2019s just say the dinner time game changed going from basic meals to restaurant quality meals.\nOne meal in particular she would make that my whole family called a favorite was her tortilla soup, the smell alone while she was cooking would make our mouths drool and even though she\u2019d make a large pot -it was always gone by the next day. \nKarla\u2019s cooking was an art, nothing she cooked was ever quick as most meals she would start cooking the day before sometimes even two depending on the meal. Typically she would start by slowly drawing out flavors of all the fresh ingredients, for example instead of using chili powder she would use fresh or dried whole chilis, instead of cinnamon powder she would use fresh cinnamon sticks, instead of store bought tortillas she would make her own and don\u2019t get me started on her tamales. \nOnce I came of age and moved out of the house it\u2019s Karla\u2019s cooking I missed above all, specifically her tortilla soup. \nI was on the phone with another aunt one day and as we were talking she brought up karla leading me to mentioned how much I missed her cooking and her tortilla soup  -this is when my aunt told me she too loves it and actually had asked Karla for the recipe, when Karla came back with the recipe my aunt realized that there was no way she was going to make that (it was too much work apparently) so she asked Karla to give her a quick /less cooking the better recipe. \nKarla came back with this:\n\n2 cans diced fire roasted tomatoes \n2 cans corn\n2 can black beans \n2 cans mild (or hot whatever preference) diced green chilis \nTaco seasoning \n3 cups Chicken bouillon broth (the cubed or powdered works just the same) \n**you could use chicken broth as well **\n2 pound boneless skinless chicken breast (or thigh) \n***you could used any leftover chicken you already have as well as a rotisserie chicken just remove from bone***\n\n\nYou can cook this in a slow cooker if you have the time and patience, or you could cook in a regular pot over the stove \n\nIf you cook in a slow cooker you want to rinse and then season your chicken with the taco seasoning on both sides and heavily (heavy because the seasoning helps flavor your broth of the soup -if you don\u2019t do enough you can always add more to the soup at the end and taste until it\u2019s to your liking) \nAnd then place the chicken on bottom of the slow cooker pot, dump all the can goods on top, add your broth, then cook on low for 6 hours or high for 3.5 \n\nIf you cook in pot you must first cook your chicken separately, do the same by seasoning the chicken with taco seasoning heavily on both sides and then cook through until no longer pink, once cooked fully the chicken should be easy to shred into pieces \n\nAdd all canned ingredients into a pot over medium heat, add broth, add cooked chicken and heat until about to boil. \n\nYou can freeze leftover soup for later, you can also up the recipe to yield more by adding more of each can just remember to up the broth\nIf you want a thick /creamy consistency you can add masa flour -just be sure to take the masa and mix in bowl with cold water to form a paste before adding to hot soup a-adding masa to hot soup directly will clump \nMasa is what is used to make tortillas so adding masa also gives the soup a nice corn flavor \nThough I\u2019ve never used flour to thicken I\u2019m sure you could that as well \n\nIf you use left over chicken just shred it and then season with taco seasoning before adding to your pot of ingredients \n\nI have no right amount of taco seasoning to add to soup as I just add and taste and add and taste until the flavor is where I want it \n\nThis meal has been a staple when I\u2019m on a budget but wanting to eat healthy, I even remember always making it when I was living in a house with 5 of my friends and we all where broke and hungry - it was always the perfect thing to make to feed a lot of people with no money. It\u2019s filling, it\u2019s healthy, and it\u2019s so good. \n\nI personally like to top it with cilantro, lime, avocado, cheese and tortilla chips -but when your on a budget those aren\u2019t always an option and it\u2019s just as good without the toppings \n\nMy aunt Karla used to hand make the tortilla strips that went on top and I\u2019ll admit they where a lot better than store bought tortilla chips only bc they where so much thicker and crunchier so they stayed crunchy despite them sitting in soup broth but over time I\u2019ve learned to put the cheese on top the soup and THEN put the crushed tortilla chips on top the cheese as it saves the chips from soaking in the broth \n\nTo be fair my aunt Karla\u2019s simplified recipe named every individual seasoning needed for the soup but the day I was broke and wanting to make it but didn\u2019t have the $ to buy all the seasoning I picked up a taco seasoning and read the back of the box and realized the taco seasoning contained all of what I needed (plus a couple more seasonings which only added flavor) \n\nTo me it\u2019s hard to wrap my head around how such flavor comes from canned vegetables and chicken -it\u2019s not exactly Karla\u2019s soup but it\u2019s close enough to satisfy my nostalgia\n\nHonestly it\u2019s so close it makes me wonder why Karla spent days cooking when all she had to do was dump in some canned goods and chicken  lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gu1fj1/meal_for_whole_family_under_15/", "created_utc": 1731924150.0, "score": 29, "author": "Amandakayayy", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gu1fj1/meal_for_whole_family_under_15/", "html_title": ""}

Prepare the Ribs:\n\nRemove the thin membrane from the back of the ribs to enhance tenderness and flavor absorption. To do this, slide a butter knife under the membrane at one end, lift it, and peel it off using a paper towel for grip. \u200b\u200b\n\nWash the ribs under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.\n\nCut the ribs into individual pieces.\n\n\n\n2. Initial Cooking:\n\nIn a large pan, add 1\u00bd cups of water and bring it to a boil.\n\nAdd the ribs to the boiling water, cover the pan with a lid, and cook for 10 minutes. This step helps to tenderize the meat.\n\n\n\n3. Saut\u00e9ing:\n\nAfter 10 minutes, remove the lid and drain any remaining water from the pan.\n\nAdd 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan and heat over medium heat.\n\nAdd the minced ginger, garlic, and onion to the pan. Saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 2 minutes.\n\nStir in the cumin powder, coriander powder, salt, black pepper, and paprika. Mix well to coat the ribs evenly.\n\n\n\n4. Simmering:\n\nCook the ribs uncovered for an additional 3 minutes, allowing the spices to meld with the meat.\n\nAdd \u00bd cup of water to the pan, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 15 minutes. This slow cooking ensures the ribs become tender and flavorful.\n\n\n\n5. Adding Sauces:\n\nRemove the lid and stir in 1 tablespoon of mustard and 4 tablespoons of chipotle barbecue sauce.\n\nCook uncovered for another 2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and coat the ribs thoroughly.\n\n\n\n6. Serving:\n\nTransfer the ribs to a serving platter.\n\nGarnish with freshly chopped parsley.\n\nServe hot, accompanied by your choice of sides.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Removing the membrane from the ribs is crucial for achieving a tender texture and allowing the flavors to penetrate the meat effectively. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n", "url": "https://youtu.be/RP_bZ8CLVw8?si=hmflaShKwSn1a3l7", "created_utc": 1731672841.0, "score": 2, "author": "Special_Struggle_336", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1grv058/tender_pork_ribs_recipe_spicy_chipotle_bbq_flavor/", "html_title": "Tender Pork Ribs Recipe: Spicy Chipotle BBQ Flavor | Easy Step-by-Step Guide - YouTube"}

{"title": "Coconut Lentil Soup", "selftext": "Made this for supper tonight. It was simple and tasty, so I wrote it down. If the directions seem overwritten, I was thinking of folks who might be new to cooking, so I was trying to avoid taking any knowledge for granted.\n\nCoconut Lentil Soup\n\n2 Tbsp vegetable oil\n\n1/2 C frozen diced onion\n\n1 C frozen chopped kale\n\n1 Tbsp sweet paprika (or more to taste)\n\n1/2 Tbsp boullion powder\n\n1/2 tsp each garlic powder, salt\n\n3 C rinsed red split lentils\n\n1 can full-fat coconut milk\n\n1 L (4 C) broth\n\n2 C water\n\n1/2 Tbsp each lime juice, soy sauce\n\n\n\nBefore you start, grab all your ingredients and measuring devices. Rinse the lentils and have containers of broth and coconut milk open.\n\nGrab a medium-large pot. If you're not sure your pot is the right size, measure by filling with water. Either fill your measuring jug and pour in until it's full, or fill the pot and pour out into the jug until it's empty. You're looking for a total capacity of at least 12 C or 3L/qts. If one seems really close to capacity, but you've got one a step bigger, use the bigger one.\n\nPut the pot on a burner on the stove and turn the heat up to high. Add the oil and wait a minute or so before adding the onion and kale. Once it starts making sizzling noises, let it cook, stirring it gently, for 2-3 minutes.\n\nAdd the paprika, boullion powder, garlic powder and salt. Let that sizzle for another 30 seconds.\n\nAdd in the lentils, the coconut milk, broth and water, and give it all a good stir. Turn the heat down to about 2/10 or 'low', and pop the lid on.\n\nCheck after about 5 minutes to make sure you've got the right temperature. You want a few gentle bubbles breaking the surface when you lift the lid. If it's bubbling more than that, turn the temp down a notch and give it a stir before putting the lid back on. If it's already on the lowest temperature and bubbling a lot, leave the lid off, and give it a stir to release some of the heat. If it's not bubbling at all, creep up the heat half a notch, slap on the lid, and check in another 5 minutes. Ideally, you want it to simmer at that rate for 10-15 minutes, or until the lentils are soft and have kind of lost their shape. The handy thing about this recipe is that it's very forgiving to a bit of overcooking.\n\nTurn off the heat and/or remove from the burner. Finish seasoning by adding lime juice and soy sauce, stirring and tasting. This is also the time to decide if you want or need to add more of any seasoning. Before adding more salt, try a bit more lime juice (or other acid) and taste it again. If it still lacks salt after that, go for it. You can also adjust seasoning by the serving, using salt, pepper, hot sauce, etc.\n\n\n\nMakes 4 big bowls or 6 smaller ones.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gl9e2f/coconut_lentil_soup/", "created_utc": 1730927816.0, "score": 12, "author": "Disastrous-Wing699", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1gl9e2f/coconut_lentil_soup/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Beef Heart", "selftext": "Due to the price, I don't eat a lot of beef, but when I'm craving some, I grab a hunk of beef heart. Strongly flavoured meats of any kind are not my bag - especially organ meats - but heart is different. Like the other 'typical' meats we buy, the heart is mostly muscle, with a bit of fat and connective tissue. And beef heart, aside from being cheap, is just about the best thing for nice, tender slices, perfect for sandwiches, stroganoff, or tossing on a bowl of rice.\n\nMy method uses an electric pressure cooker (Instant Pot) for speedy results, but the main takeaway must be that heart needs a stew or braise-type preparation to adequately tenderize and break down connective tissue. I like to prepare mine relatively plain for use in other dishes. I also use a heart portion, because that's how my grocer sells it. Look for one that's mostly 'meat', with little fat or other stuff, especially the first few times.\n\nStep 1: Liberally season the surface of the meat with salt, and any other seasoning of your choice, approximately 1 tsp per pound. Let this sit for 30-45 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Mix 1/2 C hot water with 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce and 1/2 C diced onion (frozen or fresh). Pour into the pot of your pressure cooker. Pop the heart on top, close the lid and seal it. Set it to pressure cook on low for 1.5 hours (90 minutes). Walk away.\n\nStep 3: When the buzzer goes off, turn off the cooker. Release pressure as you see fit. I usually just leave it alone until the button goes down. Remove the meat, trim and slice. Store in a container in the fridge, preferably along with the cooking liquid.\n\nHappy cooking!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1g9ts7t/beef_heart/", "created_utc": 1729632923.0, "score": 23, "author": "Disastrous-Wing699", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1g9ts7t/beef_heart/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "[Long-form] Thai Red Curry w/ Rice and a glass of milk. 7 meals, $3.23 each (in terms of what I actually used; bought ingredients in bulk)", "selftext": "Image: https://i.imgur.com/WFoSxfZ.png\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I recently moved in together. Previously we spent a lot of time at each other's apartments- it was hard to shop or cook in bulk bc we had no idea how many nights we'd be at each other's apartments. Plus, travel time.\n\nSo we got too much takeout. This was our #1 expense, so we're starting to cook in bulk now that we can.\n\n**With that: we just made Thai Red Curry w/ rice in bulk, along with a glass of milk. We got 7 meals out of it, and factoring in ingredient prices, it cost $3.23 per meal. Not to mention leftover ingredients.**\n\n# The Recipe:\n\nHomemade Red Curry Paste: https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-red-curry-paste/\n\nThai Red Curry w/ Rice (using this paste): https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-red-curry-with-chicken/\n\nWe used substitutes/adjusted quantities as we saw fit, shown below.\n\n# Ingredient Price/Use Breakdown\n\nThai Red Curry Paste\n\n|Ingredient|Purchase Price|Quantity Purchased|Quantity Used|Cost of Use|Left over|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|Thai Red Curry Peppers|$4|300\\*|30|$0.40|260 peppers\n|Lemongrass|$2|2 sticks|2 sticks|$2|N/A|\n|Ginger|$2|1 giant head|2 tbsp (10%)\\*|$0.20|18 tbsp\n|Fish Paste (Anchovy)|$3|3 tbsp|1 tbsp|$1|2 tbsp\n|Garlic|$1|1 head/12 cloves|8 cloves|$0.66|4 cloves\n|Cumin|$1|1.5 oz|1 tsp ~ 0.1 oz|$0.07|1.4 oz\n|Kinh Gioi (Vietnamese Lemon Mint)****|$2.50|A bagful|1/8 bag*|$0.31|7/8 bag\n|Red Shallots|$2.25|2|2|$2.25|N/A\n|Lime (for zesting)|$0.67|1 lime|1/4 of lime skin|$0.17**|3/4 lime skin**\n|**TOTAL**|**$18.42**|**N/A**|**N/A**|**$7.06**|**A LOT**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThai Red Curry:\n\n|Ingredient|Purchase Price|Quantity Purchased|Quantity Used|Cost of Use|Left over|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|Thai Red Curry Paste (above)|$18.42***|N/A|N/A|$7.06|A LOT\n|Vegetable Oil|$4|48 fl oz = 96 tbsp|3 tbsp|$0.13|93 tbsp\n|Vegetable Broth|$2.79|4 cups|1 cup|$0.70|3 cups\n|Coconut Milk|$3.59|400 mL|400 mL|$3.59|N/A\n|Lime (for zesting)|$0.67|1 lime|3/4 of lime skin|$0.50**|1/4 lime skin**\n|White Sugar|$3.79|4 lbs = 192 tbsp|2 tbsp|$0.04|190 tbsp\n|Fish Sauce|$8.99|24 fl oz = 48 tbsp|1 tbsp|$0.19|47 tbsp\n|Boneless Chicken Thighs|$9|2 lbs|1 lb|$4.50|1 lb\n|Pumpkin (cubed)|$5|15 oz|5 oz|$1.67|10 oz\n|Green beans|$2.50|1 bagful|1/8 bag*|$0.31|7/8 bag\n|Basil (spice)|$1|0.62 oz ~ 2.5 tbsp|1 tbsp|$0.40|1.5 tbsp\n|**Total**|**$59.75**|**N/A**|**N/A**|**$19.09**|**A LOT**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n|Ingredient|Purchase Price|Quantity Purchased|Quantity Used|Cost of Use|Left Over\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|2% Milk|$2.79|0.5 gal = 8 cups|3 cups|$1.05|5 cups\n|Almond Milk|$3.29|0.5 gal = 8 cups|4 cups|$1.65|4 cups\n|Basmati Rice|$20|20 lbs ~ 50 cups|2 cups|$0.80|48 cups\n|**Total**|**$26.08**|**N/A**|**N/A**|**$3.50**|**A LOT**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Totals/Costs\n\nI spent $85.83 in bulk materials, and it's so misleading. Because I won't have to buy most of this stuff anytime soon.\n\nAll this made 7 Meals of Thai Red Curry w/ Rice & a glass of milk each time.\n\n- Cost of 7 Meals: $22.59\n\n- **Cost of 1 Meal: $3.23**\n\nNot to mention an entire freaking pantry of leftovers. \n\nThe Thai restaurants near us would charge $18 for 1 order of this (VHCOL area). It wouldn't be nearly as nutritious- no pumpkin/green beans/kinh gioi or 1/2 the spices. Absolute best case scenario, 1 order is 1.5 meals (leftovers). Including the cost of milk from home, we're looking at $92.70 for 7 meals of less nutritious takeout. And 0 leftover ingredients after.\n\nSo we had a much more nutritious version of this meal for 3.5 days & saved at least $70.11 for 7 meals on the way. Plus we have plenty of leftover ingredients. All it took was a grocery run & 3 hours of work.\n\nI will save several hundreds of dollars if I continue using the items I bought in bulk.\n\nHope this helps someone save money or eat healthier!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\* = estimate\n\n\\** = not to mention the entire inside of the lime\n\n\\***With MANY leftovers to make again\n\n\\**** The recipe calls for cilantro, but my fianc\u00e9e has the cilantro/soap gene, so we used kinh gioi as a substitute.

While the pan is heating up cover both sides of each chicken breast with the creole seasoning. Season generously \n4. Put the 2tbsp of oil into the pan\n5. Once the oil is heated up, put the chicken into the pan. Cook until golden brown and then flip\n6. Put the chicken in the crockpot once golden brown on both sides \n7. Put the chopped green pepper and onions into the pan. Do not clean the pan prior to this\n8. Saut\u00e9 until tender\n9. Put the cooked green peppers and onions into the crockpot\n10. Pour 4 cups of water into the pan and add the better than bouillon. Let it dissolve fully\n11. Add the cholula and garlic powder to the pan and stir until mixed\n12. Dump the water mixture into the crockpot\n13. Cover the crockpot and cook on low for 6-10 hours. \n14. Take the chicken out of the crockpot and shred it. Throw it back in the crockpot after shredding\n15. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes on warm or low to allow the chicken to sit with the seasonings. This step isn\u2019t required, but is recommended\n16. Crockpot chicken done! \n17. Cook white rice following the directions. Use as much rice as you want to eat for the recipe or for that meal, depending on if you\u2019re cooking all the rice at once\n18. Portion and serve\n\nI typically keep the chicken and rice in separate containers so the rice doesn\u2019t soak up all of the liquid from the chicken prep. You can keep the liquid or strain it. I keep the liquid in the mixture as it adds to the flavor and gives it a stew-like feeling. \n\nI want to note that I don\u2019t measure the ingredients anymore so it\u2019s all a guess!

For the recipe I only used one tablespoon of flour so even if you needed to buy flour a 2 pound bag , at my Wal-Mart in Florida, is only $1.32. With only using a tablespoon the cost is nearly free.\n\nThe first time I made this I had just had two teeth pulled and couldn't eat hard foods and I was feeling extremely nostalgic for the school lunch of turkey, gravy, and mashed potatoes. We use chicken instead of turkey but it hits the spot all the same. It's super cheap and easy to make and has been entered into my husband and I's cheap and easy weeknight dinners. Also my tablespoon amounts are approximations, I used a large dinner spoon tonight.\n\nIngredients:  \n1 can of cooked chicken (Sams Club 6 pack $2/can)  \n1 pack of instant mashed potatoes (Wal-Mart Idahoan Buttery Golden Selects $1.44)  \n1 tablespoon flour  \n0.5 tablespoon Better than Bouillon chicken ($.13/tablespoon)  \n1 cup hot water  \n1 tablespoon butter (Wal-Mart $.12/tablespoon)\n\nCooking:\n\nMix a half tablespoon Better than Bouillon into a cup of very hot water, set aside. I use a liquid measuring cup so I can easily pour it into my roux mix.\n\nMake a simple chicken gravy starting with a roux by melting one tablespoon of butter in a pan over medium high heat, then add one tablespoon of flour and whisk and cook together until flour is cooked and slightly browned. Slowly add broth and whisk until no lumps, let gravy cook while continuing to whisk gently until it reaches desired consistency and taste for seasoning.\n\nAdd drained chicken to gravy and let heat through\n\nWhile chicken is heating up in gravy, make your instant mash potatoes according to directions on the package. The ones I had were a just add water.\n\nPile it all up in a bowl and enjoy!!\n\nSome footnotes:\n\nYou can make this recipe even faster/easier with instant gravy mix but we didn't have it and I can whip up a homemade gravy pretty quick. If you do use instant gravy mix it takes the cost up to around $5 total depending on brand.  \nI also added Meat Church Holy Voodoo but that's just because I really like it and I put it in literally everything I eat. It did make my gravy a little too salty so I added some plain water to the gravy and cooked it a little longer. I originally made two cups of chicken stock but I only ended up using one but better to have too much than too little!  \nThe Better than Bouillon instructions say to add a teaspoon to 8oz water but I don't find it to be flavorful enough, especially for gravy so I like to add more.

Simmer the chickpeas over low heat for about 30 minutes or until very tender.\n\nToast the bread: Set your oven rack about 6 inches beneath the boiler and set the broiler to high. While the chickpeas cook, tear some hearty crusty bread into a little larger than bite-size pieces and arrange them on a large sheet.

Watch carefully, as the bread can go from golden brown to burnt quickly!\n\nSaute the onions and garlic: Add 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a medium non-stick skillet set over medium heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions and garlic, a dash of kosher salt, cumin, coriander, and paprika. Cook over medium heat, tossing regularly until the onions are tender and translucent.\n\nSeason the chickpea stew: When the chickpeas are ready, transfer the onion and garlic mixture to the saucepan with the chickpeas. Add 1 tablespoon harissa paste, a big pinch of kosher salt, juice from 1 lemon, chopped parsley, and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning.\n\nServe: Slice the remaining lemon into wedges. Prepare serving bowls and place a few pieces of toasted bread on the bottom. Ladle the lablabi chickpea stew on top of the bread and add a good drizzle of olive oil, a dollop of harissa, more parsley, and the chopped green onions.

{"title": "Chaufa (Peruvian fried rice)", "selftext": "Healthy, tasty, easy, cheap. It's usually made with some kind of seafood, but shredded chicken or chopped meat works too. This recipe makes 4 hefty servings. There are two of us, so it lasts 2 days. This meal can be made in the time it takes to cook the rice.\n\nIngredients: 1 lb protein, 8 servings (half cup) almost any combo of 2-3 different chopped vegetables, 1.5 cups long grain rice, 2 med onions or 4-6 cloves garlic, spices (see below). Optional: up to 4 eggs, 1 carrot, 1 stalk celery.\n\nStart rice. Heat oil in pot, add raw rice, saute stirring constantly until the kitchen smells like popcorn, add the water. This flavors the rice and makes it fluffy.\n\nHeat oil in large, high-sided pan. Saute chopped onion or garlic (and chopped carrot and celery, if you have them).\n\nAdd, cook, and remove the protein (could be canned salmon, canned tuna, pkg frozen clams, chicken, hamburger, fresh or frozen fish filets, baby shrimp, etc). If it's chicken or fish, saute it whole and chop it later, to avoid hassling with raw chicken or fish.\n\nVegetables. If they're fresh or if they're canned diced tomatoes, stir-fry them in the pan now. If they're frozen, zap in microwave and add at end. Bell peppers are good, only slightly milder than the ones Peruvians use.\n\nEggs. If you have too little protein, or if you just like eggs, whisk and add them to the pan now, stirring and cutting until you have dry pieces among the veggies.\n\nTurn the heat down to lowest level and add to the pan any zapped vegs, the chopped protein, and the rice. Add seasoning (Adobo or salt, achiote/annato or turmeric for color, parsley, a hint of cayenne, cumin if you used salt instead of adobo). If the protein is fish, you can be completely American like us and add 4 ozs tarter sauce. Mix it thoroughly.\n\nServe. We use bowls, Peruvians use plates.\n\nLeftovers, if there were only 2 of you, put a lid on the pan and stick the whole thing in the fridge, ready to reheat tomorrow, when it will taste even better.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1d3tw8c/chaufa_peruvian_fried_rice/", "created_utc": 1717037392.0, "score": 14, "author": "Building_a_life", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1d3tw8c/chaufa_peruvian_fried_rice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

If you go to Hu hot, it's similar to that too.\n\nI just made a batch and in the time it takes to make one meal, we have 2 dinners for a family of 3 and a work lunch. 3 huge containers for around $14.\n\nGet stir fry beef from the butcher counter. Be ready for the price, it's double the cost of ground beef - $10-11 a pound. It's worth it for how thinly sliced it is, much thinner than what I could do at home. \n\nVeg: I've done bok choy, I've done an onion, I've done no veg. I'm sure a frozen stir fry mix would work.\n\nAt every stage, season with salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and soy sauce so that all 3 pieces get the seasoning while they cook.\n\nIngredients: \nBox of spaghetti \nOnion powder, garlic powder, soy sauce\n1lb stir fry beef\nVeg of your choice\nSpoonful of sugar\nSesame sauce, optional\nChili crisp and/or garlic chili sauce\n\n1.

Either way, cook with a little oil, and your seasonings. \n3. Set aside when you're done with the first one, and cook the second one in the same pan with same seasonings again. While the second piece cooks, throw the spaghetti into your water pot. We'll season the spaghetti when it's done obviously.\n4. Mix the strained noodles, your veg, and your meat. Your noodles aren't seasoned yet, so one more time, soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder. Add a small spoonful of sugar too. I also do a little sesame oil. I've made this enough times, getting the sesame oil was worth it.\n\nWe add garlic chili sauce and / or chili crisp to our own individual bowls because we have different tolerance for spicy but you could certainly skip it or add it to the full batch at one time.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1d1jozr/recipe_for_japanese_steakhouse_noodles_at_home/", "created_utc": 1716785306.0, "score": 13, "author": "Sudden-Signature-807", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1d1jozr/recipe_for_japanese_steakhouse_noodles_at_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How much do you spend per meal ", "selftext": "My husband and I have been living together for 8 years. During the course of the last 6 years, we\u2019ve been adhering to a strict budget. Every week I do groceries and shopping and my husband will do the accounting at the end of the month and see if we\u2019re on track. We occasionally go out to the restaurant. Since the start of our budgeting plan, we average about $1190 a year on groceries. We just had a baby last year so for sure our groceries will increase steadily as her food requirements grow. \n\nSo we\u2019ve basically broken it down to about $11/meal for the both of us, therefore $5.50 each. This is taking into consideration the number of times we have eaten out at the restaurant. I was actually surprised at how high the dollar amount is per meal. I guess I was expecting it to be lower since I do all the cooking and baking and really hardly ever buy any processed foods or ready-made meals. And I try to buy in bulk (rice, flour etc) and plan my meals around the weekly specials at the grocery stores. \n\nSo I am curious if anyone else has broken down their food spending?

{"title": "A little tip for those who have EBT (Food Stamps) and live near a Safeway", "selftext": "Safeway often has good deals and the reward points are also something to take advantage up.

I'm currently without SSI and trying to get it back, but mean while I've been using some creativity to get by with food. \n\nSpaghetti and soups will be your best friend, Safeway often has good deals on meats that are a big cut. So you can make a big batch of soup that can last you two weeks for a single person, if stored right. I have rice and oats as a last ditch effort plus some protein powder if I can get it. Milk powder is another great substitute if you can't really store milk for to long. Frozen fruit (while a bit expensive) mixed with well trail mix and some yogurt makes a good breakfast and you can stretch it by only having individual parts instead of combining to make it last longer. It may not be as good as olive oil, fat at Safeway is a dollar per pound and it is EBT approved. So you can cook with that if you can't get any cooking oil (just learned this recently actually) make sure to give them a days notice though. I do buy energy drinks though which isn't smart on my end but I run on it, though I can make a single can last 2-3 days.

{"title": "Got a surprisingly good stew recipe from Townsends", "selftext": "I've been looking into historical cooking stuff, as a curiosity. And I tried the recipe from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WjvTGkRzZM&t=99s), about recipes formulated for working-class families who needed to stretch their money out. The recipes are pretty vague, by their nature, but I ended up using:\n\n* 2 lbs pork stew meat (if I scaled the recipe up, I might have used a whole pork shoulder for an even cheaper per-pound cost), cut into small pieces\n* 1 large onion, peeled and diced\n* about 1 Tbsp minced garlic, or 3-4 cloves minced\n* 2 large carrots, diced\n* 1 turnip, peeled and diced\n* 2 yukon gold potatoes (or any potatoes that are convenient), peeled and diced\n* 6 quarts water\n* chicken/pork/beef bouillon, optional (adds to the stock)\n* 2 Cups whole oats, ground into a powder\n* 1-2 Bay Leaves, optional\n* dried Thyme or Parsley, optional\n* Salt and Pepper, to taste\n\nWhile the historical recipe was pretty simple, I added a few steps that felt more common in a modern kitchen, and would add a bit of extra flavor.\n\n1. Add any fat trimmings from your meat to a large pot over medium heat, and let the fat render out. Once the fat's been rendered, you can pull the pieces out, or leave them in the stew.\n2. Liberally season the meat with salt and pepper, add it to the pot, and brown in batches. Remove everything, and set it aside for now.\n3. Add your onions, and cook for 3-4 minutes, until transluscent and softened. Take a bit of time to scrape up the fond from the meat. Add your garlic during the last minute, and cook everything together until the garlic is fragrant.\n4. Add the meat back in, along with your water and bouillon (if using) and bring everything to a boil. Add any herbs or spices you're using, if you wish. Reduce to a simmer, and let it sit for 45 minutes. This will infuse the water with proteins from the meat, and add richness and flavor to your stock. \n5. Add your root vegetables (carrots, turnips, potatoes), and your oat flour. Stir to break up any lumps in the oats, but this isn't necessary. Cook for another 15 minutes, and then taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\nThe oats will thicken the liquid slightly, giving it a lot of body. I used some things I already had in my pantry, like oats. But overall I made this for about $12, and got 16 cups of stew (about 8 meals).\n\nIf I were to review the recipe, I could add maybe twice as many vegetables to bulk up the stew without much more to the total cost. But it's a really flavorful stew, that's rich in protein and quite filling (especially with bread).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1cbhpei/got_a_surprisingly_good_stew_recipe_from_townsends/", "created_utc": 1713910560.0, "score": 25, "author": "CrazyPlato", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/1cbhpei/got_a_surprisingly_good_stew_recipe_from_townsends/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "What's the best way to order pizza?", "selftext": "I went to Domino's today and got the extravaganza. It wasn't overly expensive but I realized the pizza wasn't really more coated with toppings despite there being more toppings on the order. I feel like when you get multiple toppings they just put less of each one on the pizza and it ends up containing the same total volume of toppings as there would be with fewer number of toppings.\n\nHas anyone done the math? Is there some optimum formula where you can maximize topping content while minimizing cost?\n\nAlso (as an aside) how do they get away with charging more per topping if they don't provide the same amount of that topping? If I order a 3 topping pizza, for instance, I should get the same number of pepperonis, peppers and onions as they would put on a one topping pizza with each of those toppings. If not, they shouldn't charge per topping; they should perhaps charge by total mass of all the toppings instead of the number of different toppings (the quantity of which is determined by the person making the pizza).\n\nIt doesn't take any additional time for the pizza maker to put a different topping on the pizza since they're literally just in bins in front of them. Therefore it's simply a matter of food volume. If I'm paying more for another topping, I should be getting more total food. The pizza should actually weigh more.

I also added about half a teaspoon of MSG towards the end with the stock and lentils, but this is totally optional.\n\n1. Start by frying your onions on a medium heat for around 6-8 minutes until slightly brown, then turn it up to medium-high and add your mince. Brown that for about 5 minutes and then add the spices, chopped tomatoes, and garlic. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. \n2. While it's browning, add your tomato puree to your beef stock and dissolve. Set this aside for a minute while the spices, garlic and tomatoes are cooking. \n3. Add your drained and rinsed lentils and the beef stock-tomato puree mixture. Stir, bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the spinach and let it wilt. The stew is ready, so serve up with some rice, crumbled feta and a crack of black pepper.\n\n\nI've priced it up, but haven't included staples that I already have in, like garlic, all the spices, tomato puree, and rice. I've always got a decent stock of those, so haven't factored it in to the price.\n\nIt costs between \u00a31.03 and \u00a31.19 per portion, depending on if I use lean mince, or regular.

These recipes are designed to be easy to prepare with minimal equipment and are meals that I personally continue to incorporate into my diet. They are great for maintaining a healthy weight without straining your budget.\n\nFor those living in a dorm, I have compiled an efficient inventory list that enables cooking in a limited space.

This allows you to have them ready for future meals instead of cooking them on the spot.\n\nFor carbohydrates, I recommend preparing staples like rice and pasta. These can be boiled in about 30 minutes and then microwaved when needed.\n\nFor proteins, although they can be cooked and stored, it's important to note that their taste may differ slightly from when they're freshly prepared. If you choose to meal prep proteins, aim to cook enough for 1-3 days at a time. This approach ensures convenience without compromising too much on taste.\n\n# Breakfast Meals\n\n# 1.

The dehydrated veggies are comparatively less so add 1/2 cup frozen vegetables (green peans, corn, carrot) which will give a nice texture.\n\n6. Let the soup simmer for approx 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\nIn some recipes hot water is directly added to the mix.

It enhances the overall quality of the soup compared to simply adding hot water.\n\n9.
