{"title": "Frustration with \"safe canning practices\" and following recipes", "selftext": "I'm fairly new to canning, only been doing it for a year or so.  When I first started learning about canning, like most folks I was met with a barrage of safety information and the potential consequences of not canning correctly.  I viewed this as a good thing, I'm all for being safe and learning all the little tricks to refining a process and doing it correctly.  A huge theme through all this information was following the recipe, do not change the recipe, only approved tested recipes and so forth.  Great, no problem, I do well with black and white direction.\n\nFast forward to the actual recipes, and that's where the questions start.....\n\nI'll use the Ball Book of Canning's recipe for pressure canning pot roast in a jar as an example.  It calls for 1/2 cup celery, and I hate celery.  Can I remove that?  Is that \"changing the recipe?\"  It calls for 1 cup red wine but also clearly lists it as \"optional\".  If you take the time to mark one ingredient as optional, does that make everything else mandatory?  What other ingredients are optional, and which are absolutely necessary?  How do you determine that?\n\nAnother example,  water bath canning cranberries.  Ball, the USDA, and the NCHFP all have instructions for this that list Heavy Syrup specifically.  Heavy Syrup is a disgusting sugary mess to me, and would ruin anything I put in it.  Can I use lighter syrup?  The NCHFP has a footnote under their syrups that states;\n\n1. *Many fruits that are typically packed in heavy syrup are excellent and tasteful products when packed in lighter syrups. It is recommended that lighter syrups be tried, since they contain fewer calories from added sugar.*\n\nTo me, that reads as use whatever syrup you would like for fruits.  Would it not make more sense to put \"syrup of your choice\" in the recipe?  Why list a specific syrup weight in the recipe?  I dug around all my books and several websites and found another sub-note that reads \"*Adding syrup to canned fruit helps to retain its flavor, color, and shape. It does not prevent spoilage of these foods\"*. \n\nAm I just not correctly understanding what a \"recipe\" is?  Is there some wiggle room in a recipe?  If so, how much, and how is a person expected to determine this?  Why take the time and effort to  list specifics in a recipe when they are not specifically necessary or when there are a variety of other options available?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/186t8va/frustration_with_safe_canning_practices_and/", "created_utc": 1701274734.0, "score": 663, "author": "FartsInCode", "num_comments": 88, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/186t8va/frustration_with_safe_canning_practices_and/", "html_title": ""}

This can have several advantages, but also costs a hit to accuracy and reliability. Temperature, specific gravity, viscosity; these can all play into how well a pH meter will measure. If you\u2019ve ever used one, you may notice you can get the value to shift if you shake it around, or move from hot to warm to cold samples.\n\nTitration, or the act of adding a known amount of a known concentration of an acid or a base, of a sample is far more accurate and precise. Depending on the concentration, I can get precision far below the stated error of even my nice Cole pH meter.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all to say that if you can titrate at home it\u2019s safe to can things off book.

Even experienced canners like myself get comfortable and I was too trusting. \n\nHubby and I attended a \u201csalsa fest\u201d festival where there were a bunch of different vendors sampling their salsas and you could vote for your favorite. One of them was an avocado-tomatillo salsa, totally my jam (well, used to be \ud83e\udd22) which I tried but hubby did not. I loved it and bought a jar. The vendor was a restaurant owner so I assumed he was using a commercial kitchen and high grade equipment to jar up his salsas. I should have asked him how he is able to can avocados. When we got home, I had a little bit of a stomach ache and cramping, but I figured it was from eating chips and salsa as a meal with nothing else and it passed after a few hours. Yesterday, I made a chicken wrap with the avocado salsa for lunch. About 2 hours later, I was so very sick. Sicker than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. Luckily it passed after about 12 hours. \n\nThis morning, I checked the jar of salsa and noticed that in tiny letters across the bottom of the label it says \u201cThis food is made in a home kitchen and is not inspected by the department of state health services or a local health department\u201d \n\nI should have known better y\u2019all. I know avocado is not an approved ingredient to can. I should have questioned him on this and I definitely should not have purchased it. \n\nI just wanted to share my experience with you, and remind you all to be safe and ask questions! \n\nEdit to add: I am in Texas\u2026 [Cottage Food Law](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/retail-food-establishments/texas-cottage-food-production)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1h0coab/biggest_mistake_ever/", "created_utc": 1732630012.0, "score": 338, "author": "froggrl83", "num_comments": 47, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1h0coab/biggest_mistake_ever/", "html_title": ""}

It was stressful in the moment, but ended up being such a blast and a story we will tell for the rest of our lives!! \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to fully decorate the jars or display them in the way I had envisioned, as they understandably fell to the very bottom of the list of priorities in all the chaos. But I got the stickers on them at least and they still turned out very cute. And my guests loved them!! I keep getting requests for more. And overall I\u2019m still immensely I got to get married to the love of my life, which is what truly mattered. Despite a freaking hurricane!! But Helene tried really hard!! My heart goes out to all the ones who lost so much more than me! We are very lucky and blessed at the end of the day.\n\nHere is the recipe for carrot cake jam: https://www.ballmasonjars.com/blog?cid=carrot-cake-jam\n\nThe apple pie jam recipe is in the Ball All New Book of canning and Preserving and also the Ball Back to the Basics book.

{"title": "First time making my Grandma\u2019s applesauce!", "selftext": "Just occurred to me to post this here. I recently made my grandma\u2019s applesauce using wealthy apples for the first time ever. She passed away in 2012 and my family has missed her and her applesauce so much. She made so much amazing food, but her applesauce was always one of my favorites, and will forever be the best applesauce to me.\n\nEarlier this year I finally found an orchard that sells and ships wealthy apples. Had to wait for season of course, but I\u2019ve been looking for years and could never find the apples themselves (just trees for sale when I\u2019d previously search).\n\nI\u2019m in South Florida, so this was a real tough find. I paid dearly for it, but it was worth every penny to taste this again. I bought 20 lbs, which I discovered goes a lot quicker than I anticipated!\n\nI never got an opportunity to make applesauce with her while she was here, so I was going in somewhat blind, but I do have a newspaper clipping recipe for applesauce I found in her recipe box after she passed. (Practiced it a few times with cheap grocery store apples first too lol).\n\nIt\u2019s amazinggggg!!! That\u2019s the correct recipe for sure! I think I may be off a bit with some of the proportions because it seems just slightly off, but it\u2019s close enough, I\u2019m thrilled!! Soon I\u2019ll be visiting my dad, can\u2019t wait to give him some jars and see how he likes it. He\u2019ll be the official judge on my accuracy!\n\nBased on the price I spent, I probably won\u2019t be doing this every year. But now that I\u2019ve finally had actual wealthy apples, I\u2019m going to be on the hunt for a locally available alternative. But for now, I\u2019m going to treasure this!

{"title": "How to encourage getting gifted jars back.", "selftext": "\nI'm planning on gifting a good amount of canned goods this year, but I've always had trouble getting jars back. I don't want to harass people because it is a gift,  but it becomes expensive when you gift 4+ jars. I was thinking of including a little note with baskets with a \"bottle deposit\" kind of statement like, \"return 3 or more jars for a free jam refill!\"\n\nI don't know how it's be received. What have you all done in the past? Wish everyone was like my mother who comes back with bags of my jars to trade in all the time!\n\nEdit: To help clarify for the \"cheap\" commenters. What's expensive is relative from person to person. What's considered cheap is as well. I've had comments that they think my canned goods are \"cheap cope outs\" instead of buying a gift (no I just get those people cards these days.) Instead of the labor of love that it is so I can do more on a smaller budget. Which is why I started doing it. \n\nNot everyone has the same budget as you.\n\nWhen those that do love them let me know \"I'm so excited for the jams this year\" I'm seeing it not as 100% a gift when I'm not sure I can do it. I was looking for a way to continue on without telling them it's too expensive. Or not put them in cheap plastic containers that are not shelf stable.\n\nThis is not about one offs, like bringing something over to a party etc. It's for the people I love and care for so I'd hope they'd love and care enough about me to give it back if it's not an inconvenience (and get more things that they wanted in the first place) . I'm just looking for a way to prompt them into thinking about it without asking if they don't use the jars themselves.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/17cv5n9/how_to_encourage_getting_gifted_jars_back/", "created_utc": 1697865468.0, "score": 218, "author": "rottenann", "num_comments": 289, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/17cv5n9/how_to_encourage_getting_gifted_jars_back/", "html_title": ""}

Today I made a stop at the store to grab some vinegar and salt. I was rather dismayed to find that in the canning section the price for 5% vinegar and pickling salt were upwards of $6-7 dollars because they carried the Mrs. Weges and Ball name.  Being the thrifty soul I am that has been canning for ages I decided to do a price comparison.  I went a few aisles over to the spice and dressing aisles.  A gallon of 5% vinegar was $2.69 vs. the $6 a gallon Mrs. Weges brand.  4lbs of Morton's preserving and pickling salt was $1.59 vs. the 2lb  Ball brand for $6.79.  I feel like newbies should know that they don't need to buy these products at drastic markups just because they have the name.  For some it could be cost prohibitive and canning the joy of summer harvest should be accessible to those that want to give it a try.  So that's it.  That's my psa.

Deciding to do the actual cooking and canning not on the weekend, but on Monday after work. \n3. Forgetting to start the salsa until 7:30 pm.\n4. Estimating, without doing the math, that a double batch of salsa would fit in one of the pots we did have unpacked. \n5. Not digging through boxes to find the stock pot that WOULD fit the double batch of salsa until the aforementioned inadequately sized pot was full to the brim and about to boil over. \n6. Starting this WHOLE DAMN PROJECT without realizing I did not know where my empty pint jars were. \n\nExtremely Good Decision:\n1.

{"title": "R/Canning joining the site-wide protest June 12th", "selftext": "Hi Everyone:\n\n  Friendly neighbourhood moderator here.  As many of you likely know [we recently held a poll to gauge the communities interest in participating in the mod-driven Reddit Blackout](https://reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/143ow92/should_rcanning_join_the_sitewide_protest_june/).  89% of you agreed that we should blackout the subreddit in solidarity with the other participating subreddits.\n\nSo that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.  Monday at around midnight EDT I\u2019ll mark this subreddit as Private, with a note as to why we\u2019ve inaccessible.\n\n___\n#Q & A\n\n* **I\u2019m out of the loop \u2014 why is the subreddit going private?**\n\nIn case you\u2019ve been away for a bit, Reddit recently made the decision to start charging 3rd party Reddit apps for API access, with virtually no warning.  Nobody really disputes that this may be a reasonable request on its face \u2014 but the amount they\u2019re asking for is astronomical.  u/iamthatis, the solo developer of Apollo for iOS and iPadOS was told he\u2019d need to pay Reddit upward of **$20 million a year** for access.  This is an amount that is well over 20x the industry average.\n\nAs such, a variety of third party apps like Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Sync, Relay, ReddPlanet and more have announced they\u2019re shutting down June 30th.  Narwhal and BaconReader haven\u2019t made an announcement just yet, but their devs have indicated that if this plan goes forward, they won\u2019t be able to afford to continue.\n\nMany people (including yours truly) rely on these apps, as they typically have better integrations and features than the official Reddit app.  But where I could always choose to instead use the website, our friends in the blind and low-vision communities have things much worse.  People in these communities rely on _these same 3rd party apps_ to access Reddit at all.  Members of these communities are simply being shut out of Reddit as of July 1st.  Reddit has claimed they\u2019re working with groups that make screen reader and other accessibility software to improve the situation, but it doesn\u2019t look like any of this is going to be ready in time for July 1st, and even when it is it will only be at best a half-measure (just reading the screen of a terrible app doesn\u2019t make that app accessible when you didn\u2019t design for it in the first place).\n\nBecause of this, your moderators and those of a wide variety of other subreddits we all know and love are going private in protest starting Monday, June 12th.  The original intent was to go dark for two days, but many subs (our included) will go dark either until Reddit reverses course, or they force us to be public again.\n\nFor more details, see [Don\u2019t Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps!](https://reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/).\n\nFor a growing list of the subreddits taking part in the blackout, see [Incomplete and Growing List of Participating Subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/).  (r/Canning to be added shortly).\n\n* **What do you want to happen?**\n\nIdeally, Reddit backs down on their current plan to shut down 3rd party apps July 1st.  They need to both give 3rd party app developers more notice than the few weeks they were given, and reduce their API pricing to make it reasonable.\n\n* **What do you _think_ will happen?**\n\nThat\u2019s harder to say.  Honestly, I suspect Reddit will force our subreddit and all the others to be public again.  They hold most of the cards here.\n\n* **What is the worst case scenario here?**\n\nWorst case scenario from our (moderators) standpoint is Reddit reverses our making the subreddit private, purges the mod team, our favourite 3rd party apps stop working, and a huge swath of Redditors who have threatened to do so leave the platform leaving it with few contributors.  Those in the blind and low-vision communities will simply disappear.\n\n* **What will the mods do if the subreddit is forced to be public again?**\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m already considering cancelling my account if Reddit doesn\u2019t back off on their stance against 3rd party apps.\n\nI\u2019ve been around the online world for four decades now.  I\u2019ve seen the rise and fall of FidoNet, USENET, Slashdot, Digg, and several other comment-based messaging platforms.  I\u2019ve had to move my digital \u201chome\u201d before.  It hasn\u2019t been the first time, it won\u2019t be the last time.\n\nAnd while a small number of you might not believe it, but u/dromio05 and I don\u2019t do this for the \u201cpower trip\u201d.  u/dromio05 can speak for himself as he likes, but I\u2019m fully employed as a manager for a large technology company, have a family of my own, volunteer my time with a few local community groups (including as the Canning and Preserving Convenor at our local fair), and sit on a Board of Directors.  I don\u2019t get paid to do this job.  I\u2019ve never so much as got a free t-shirt for it.  Reddit often doesn\u2019t respect our time and the free work we do here by adding in features nobody wants, but which we\u2019re expected to also moderate or otherwise deal with.  We occasionally have to deal with abuse from users.\n\nWe do this unpaid job for the joy of home canning, and the desire to share that with the world in a safe and scientifically validated manner.  My reward is when we see happy posts from this community we love about the things they\u2019ve made and the joy they bring.  Whether or not that will be enough to keep me here if Reddit doesn\u2019t step back is something I\u2019ll have to search my soul to decide.  The fact they\u2019re going to make it harder by forcing Apollo (which I\u2019m using to compose this post) to go dark isn\u2019t helping.\n\nIf the subreddit is forced back to being public, u/dromio05 and I will effectively be on strike (as will mods in many other communities).  We\u2019ll stop flairing and removing unsafe posts, spam will start to appear in the feed, and abusive users will go unchecked.  Likely not the end of the world, but we do expect it to be a degraded experience.\n\n* **Where will people go for safe canning discussions while the blackout is in effect?**\n\nThis question has weighed heavily on me these past few days.  In may ways, r/Canning is a bulwark against a tide of bad and unsafe canning advice that can be found all over the Internet.\n\nI don\u2019t have an answer for this.  We will do our best to direct people who find our private subreddit notice to our primary trusted canning recipe sources, but otherwise this is going to have to be a problem members of our community come together and fix, whether it be here or elsewhere.\n\n* **Who will have access to the subreddit once it goes private?**\n\nThe moderators will have access, as will a very small number of users who (for mostly historical reasons) have been flagged as \u201capproved members\u201d.  The number of people in this group is less than 10 \u2014 if you\u2019re one of these people (and you may not know you are) r/Canning may appear as normal, and you may still have the ability to interact with its content.  I\u2019m not planning on reversing this \u2014 the number of people with such access is so low it\u2019s not enough to constitute a \u201ccommunity\u201d.  It will be like being the last people living in a ghost town.\n\n___\n\nFriends and community members, this may be good-bye for some of us.  It was fun while it lasted, and I can only hope Reddit sees the light and comes to their senses so we can get back to showing off our home canning projects, and talking about our summer jams and jellies and other tasty creations.\n\n_This post composed on Apollo for iPadOS_\n\n-----\n#**July 21st, 2023 Update**\n**Reddit Admins have fired your moderation team for following the communities wishes.

{"title": "Just completed a Master Food Preserver course through Cornell Cooperative Extension! Here's what it was like.", "selftext": "Hi guys!  I posted here a few months ago about signing up for a Master Food Preserver course through the Cornell Cooperative Extension in New York State.  It was suggested that I report back upon its completion, so that's what I'm doing now!\n\nThe class lasted for three days, eight hours each day, that involved a mix of classroom lectures, hands-on time in the kitchen, and time spent watching food preservation demonstrations.  The cost was $380 per person, and included a Master Food Preserver manual (which is geared towards teaching food preservation) and we all got to try every item that we preserved over the duration of the class, as well as take a few things home.  Lunch and snacks were also provided in great supply (seriously, you could spend the entire day eating if you wanted!).  Our class had 21 people registered and two instructors, plus three support staff that helped behind the scenes to help things run smoothly.\n\nTopics that we covered:  economics and nutrition of home preserved foods; food safety/science of food preservation; equipment for canning; canning basics; high acid canning; jellied products; pickling; low acid foods; freezing foods; dehydrating foods.  \n\nOverall I found the class to be awesome and very worthwhile.  I've been preserving food for about eight years now, but still learned plenty of new things.  I have no experience with pressure canning so learning from experts was really nice.  In the kitchen they had three types of boiling water bath canners (the standard pot type, a steam canner, and the Ball electric canner) and we all got to try every type of canner.  We also got experience with both dial gauge and weighted gauge pressure canners.  The recipes that we made and/or that were demonstrated for us ran a fairly complete gamut; the course was well designed to help learn the full range of preservation techniques.  \n\nThere were a few areas where I felt there was room for improvement.  The biggest thing: this class was advertised as being a certification class to become a Master Food Preserver when in fact it was the *first step* in becoming a Master Food Preserver.  In order to gain certification, you need to submit a log of your canning and teaching activities that encompass all of the topics we covered in class.  This was the biggest thing that I felt needed to be changed, and by changed I just mean better communicated.\n\nBesides that, here are my critiques: \n\n- In the kitchen we were broken into three groups of seven; each group worked on a different recipe in a given topic (example: three different jam recipes using different types of pectin/sugar levels; three different pickled items; one team making raw pack tomatoes and one team doing hot pack so that we could compare them; that kind of thing).  Seven people working on one recipe meant that sometimes people weren't really doing much besides watching, which I was fine with but could certainly understand if others weren't.  The kitchen was small, which was nice in that we were all able to keep up with what the other groups were doing on their respective recipes, but it was rough in that it was 21 people in a small kitchen and it sometimes got a bit chaotic.  \n\n- The amount of guidance that you got in the kitchen varied based on which instructor was helping you; again, I was fine with this as I have a good amount of experience, but I could see how if you were a new canner it might be a bit overwhelming and confusing.  The caveat to the guidance bit is that during the pressure canning module, we were all equally heavily supervised/instructed which I appreciated being new to that technique.\n\nThe best part of this class, however, was being able to luxuriate in spending three days in an alternate universe where everyone has the same niche interests.  It was a total summer camp atmosphere, which you don't really get a ton as an adult, being tossed into a mixed group of strangers that you bond with over the course of a very short time and then potentially never see again.  I'm used to being the token weirdo to whom people can't usually relate about the toil of slugs on an organic garden, having opinions on different brands of pectin, the best variety of green beans for freezing and canning, how to plant as much food as possible in a suburban backyard, where to find 100% neem oil, that kind of thing.  But for just a little bit, I was able to talk to people who didn't just glaze over!  It was a really great group that jelled well (ba dum TISS) and I am better for having had the whole experience.  Oh and now I apparently also make kombucha, which I didn't intend to do but alas, here I am.\n\nIf anyone is interested or has any questions about the class, I'm happy to chat more about it!  :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/va4elr/just_completed_a_master_food_preserver_course/", "created_utc": 1654974812.0, "score": 186, "author": "lilgreenie", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/va4elr/just_completed_a_master_food_preserver_course/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Your gauge should be calibrated yearly to ensure that you are processing your foods at the correct pressure. This service is usually provided by your local extension office. Check out this list to find your local extension office ([~https://www.uaex.uada.edu/about-extension/united-states-extension-offices.aspx~](https://www.uaex.uada.edu/about-extension/united-states-extension-offices.aspx)). \n\nIf you do not have access to this service an excellent alternative is to purchase a weight set that works with your dial gauge canner to turn it into a weighted gauge canner. If you do that then you do not need to calibrate your gauge every year. If you have a weighted gauge pressure canner it does not need to be calibrated! Weighted gauge pressure canners regulate the pressure using the weights, the gauge is only for reference.

Visit the wiki to learn more, found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommunityFunds/wiki/). TL;dr version: we can apply for up to $50,000 in grant money to carry out a project centered around our sub and its membership.\n\nOur idea would be to source recipe ideas from this community, come up with a method and budget to develop them into tested recipes, and then release them as open-source recipes for everyone to use free of charge.\n\nWhat we would need:\n\nFirst, the aim of this program is to promote community building, engagement, and participation within our sub. We would like to gauge interest, get recommendations, and find out who could participate and in what capacity. If there is enough interest, the mod team will write a proposal and submit it.\n\nIf approved, we would need help from community members to carry out the development. Some ideas of things we would need are community members to create or source the recipes, help by preparing them and giving feedback on taste/quality/etc., and help with carefully documenting the recipe steps.\n\nIf we get approved, and can get the help we need from the community, then the next steps are actually doing the thing! This will involve working closely with a food lab at a university. Currently, the mod heading up this project has access to Oregon State and New Mexico State University, but we are open to working with other universities depending on some factors like cost, availability, timeline, and ease of access since samples will have to be shipped.\n\nPlease let us know what you think through a comment or modmail if this sounds exciting to you, or if you have any ideas on how we might alter the scope or aim of this project.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/19fizuy/community_funds_program_announcement/", "created_utc": 1706214571.0, "score": 68, "author": "AutoModerator", "num_comments": 107, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/19fizuy/community_funds_program_announcement/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Anyone who has used these jars with taps will know they are not very practical for their intended use, however I am certain I will find a new career for them!\n\nMy next project is homemade pineapple wine and I wondered if there was any way I could remove the taps and create a lasting, presentable yet food safe/hygienic block that can withstand the pressures of fermentation/carbonation (especially as the tap is at the front with the beautiful Kilner logo design, so I'd like for them to be as presentable as possible).\n\nThe internet is never my friend and I can never put things into the correct words/terms to generate the results I want.\n\nI wondered if anyone has any experience with this perhaps? I could leave the tap system in place but I do not know it's integrity under fermentation pressures or if the tap system can be cleaned suitably for this process? \n\nAlternatively, can anyone think of any other use for these jars with the taps in situ if the above is not achievable? I have many items in the kitchen from my partners Mother that I feel privileged to use and simply want to include these.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/b3ibk8bzilxe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745854906.0, "score": 3, "author": "Dense-Limit437", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1k9ynst/can_you_modify_a_kilner_jar_with_tap/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "From OSU Extension Office: Floral Jellies", "selftext": "So a PSA here about the safety of dandelion jelly had me reaching out to my local extension office. This is because I had just steaped both a Dandelion tea and a Grape Hyacinth tea for the purpose of creating a jelly. Specifically: I had zero intention of putting any of the petals into the final product. I've included OSU's response here:\n\nThanks for reaching out about herbal and floral jellies. There has been a lot of chatter and disagreement online recently about these products, but fortunately there are several good options for tested canning recipes available. \n\nFirst, a bit of explanation. Anytime we are considering canning something, we have to think about the final acidity of the product. High acid ingredients, like most berries, are generally safe to can in a boiling water canner because their naturally low pH prevents pathogens like Clostridium botulinum from growing when stored at room temperature. Herbs and flowers, however, are not naturally high acid ingredients, and we have to use tested canning recipes that control pathogen growth by adding acid (lowering the pH), adding sugar (binding up moisture), or some combination of these two techniques. This is true even if you are creating a tea from the herbs that is very well strained. The tea itself is likely not acidic enough to prevent pathogen growth. To be safe for canning, you would need to add a tested amount of acid (like lemon juice), sugar, or a combination of the two.\n\nFortunately, some recipes for herbal or floral jellies have been tested for canning. Two commercial pectin producers have recipes online for floral or herbal infusion jellies for canning. Pectin manufacturers test their recipes to ensure that enough acid, sugar, or some combination of the two is added to make the product safe for canning. [Ball/Bernardin](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US) has a flexible herb jelly recipe that uses vinegar as an acidulant, and Pomona's Pectin has both an [herb jelly](https://pomonapectin.com/herb-jelly/) and a [floral ](https://pomonapectin.com/rose-petal-jelly-2/)jelly that use lemon juice as an acidulant. The companies listing these recipes both state that different culinary herbs or edible flowers can be substituted for the original ingredients.\n\nDue to the low acidity of many herbal and floral ingredients, it would not be safe to can an herbal or floral jelly using recipes that were originally formulated for high acid ingredients like fruits and berries. Freezing these modified jam or jelly recipes rather than canning them is a safe alternative for storage. The University of Wyoming has a recipe online for a [dandelion freezer jelly](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uwyoextension.org/uwnutrition/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dandelion-Jelly.pdf&source=gmail&ust=1745683604628000&usg=AOvVaw3hohjwE1hMQ3X562FOUczn) that is similar to what you suggest for freezer storage.\n\nSo, in short, you have options, but make sure that you only can a jelly with a low acid ingredient if the recipe has been tested for safety.\n\nThanks for using Ask Extension!\n\nJared\n\n\n\nSo for us foragers out there, we do have options for our flower and herbal jelly's but always make sure you're using a tested recipe. \n\nReiterating a passage from above: The companies listing these recipes both state that different culinary herbs or edible flowers can be substituted for the original ingredients.\nLinks for recipes:\n[Ball/Bernardin Herb Jelly](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US)\n\n[Pomona's Pectin herb jelly jelly](https://pomonapectin.com/herb-jelly/)\n[Pomona's Pectin floral jelly](https://pomonapectin.com/rose-petal-jelly-2/)\n\nPDF  [University of Wyoming dandelion freezer jelly](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uwyoextension.org/uwnutrition/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dandelion-Jelly.pdf&source=gmail&ust=1745683604628000&usg=AOvVaw3hohjwE1hMQ3X562FOUczn) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1k7pf9r/from_osu_extension_office_floral_jellies/", "created_utc": 1745599000.0, "score": 11, "author": "SeaPomegranateBliss", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1k7pf9r/from_osu_extension_office_floral_jellies/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

See the VERY BOTTOM of this post for a late April update that includes TWO exceptions for very SPECIFIC recipes. \n\n**That list includes but is not limited to**:\n\n* Dandelion Jelly\n* Redbud Jelly\n* Cherry Blossom Jelly\n* Magnolia Jelly\n* Violet Jelly\n* Lilac Jelly\n\nThese jellies (like all experimental jellies) can only be made safely as \"refrigerator\" or \"freezer\" jellies. If making as a fridge / freezer project, do not process in your waterbath canner. It is a waste of time, energy & lids, adds nothing to the safety or perishability of the food, and may lead another person to mistakenly believe the jelly to be shelf stable.  \n\nIf you'd like to know more, please keep reading! Post questions below!\n\n**We understand you may have a recipe or a link you have used before. If your Floral Jelly recipe was posted or printed before 2024, it is no longer considered safe.**\n\nHere's the science:\n\nThe acidity of these jellies is not low enough to prevent growth of botulism spores **and** the water activity (even at a 1:1 sugar to water ratio) is potentially high enough to still allow for microbial growth. [Both University of Wyoming and University of California agree on this](https://ask.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=862444). The problem is that these two original floral jelly recipe bulletins got posted in MANY places online and trying to take them all down is like playing whack-a-mole. What's worse is that plenty of 'Cowboy Canners' took the original recipes and thought, *\"Well, if I can do dandylions, I should be able to do ALL edible flowers!\"* and created tons of visually pleasing but potentially gastric-upsetting blogs and social media posts.\n\nMake your florals if you enjoy them and put them in the fridge or freezer.\n\n  \nEDIT: Adding more content on April 29, 2025 [https://ask.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=898495](https://ask.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=898495)\n\nWe have a few options.\n\nBall/Bernadin HERBAL jelly with vinegar [https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US) and Pomona's Floral and Herbal are both good to go!

{"title": "Homemade applesauce from my mom, is it safe to eat?", "selftext": "Hello! I don't know much about canning, but my mom gave me this jar of applesauce she made sometime in the past couple months and I'm wondering if it's safe to eat?\n\nSome details about the jar and canning process:\n\n* Before opening it leaked a little bit of liquid, I suspect she maybe overfilled the jar and some came out around the lid but not really sure. It was kind of brown and sticky, so probably just like sugary liquid. \n* I just opened it and there's some mold around the outside of the jar under the lid. There's no visible mold on the inside, and the top of the rim looks clean, so maybe had a proper seal anyways and is safe? \n* The inside of the lid has mold and rust on the outer parts, past where the seal would be. The applesauce on the lid looks fine other than one spot where there are some very small dark spots, which is probably the thing I'm most concerned about.\n* The taste is fine but slightly acidic or something? I can't exactly place the taste as it's very very slight, and could even just be the normal taste of the applesauce even before canning. It makes me wonder if it could have slightly fermented, or if it could be something else that could be dangerous. The taste isn't strong or bad enough for me to say if it's gone bad, I do notice from taste and smell when fresh food has spoiled, like with dairy products, produce, etc.\n* My mom pretty regularly makes jams and other canned products at home and I can't remember a time where something was canned improperly so that the contents became unsafe to eat. From what I remember as a kid she heats the jars and lids in the oven to sterilize them and fills them with the warm jam or applesauce. I think she does something else after filling the jars, but not quite sure, then stores them in a cool, dark place.\n* This batch was stored in our cellar, which has some moisture and possibly mold issues, which could be the cause of the mold in the lid.\n\n  \nSince I don't know much about canning and food safety I'm not sure if this is enough to make it unsafe to consume (slightly paranoid about botulism haha), so if anyone has any insight it would be very helpful!

I have two concerns:\n\n1- Is the extra starchyness a potential sign that something went wrong in my attempt at following the recipe?\n\n2- Does the \"mush\" at the bottom mean that there could have been potentially not enough water circulating around the beans to properly pasteurize everything? Or is this a normal event in home canned beans due to the long time pressure canning them (75 minutes), so some beans will always open up and fall through the bottom but the whole jar will still be safe to eat?

{"title": "So... how *do* we know if our over-pressure devices really work?", "selftext": "Many years ago, I had an older-style Prestige England (not TTK Prestige India) aluminium pressure-cooker with a combined ready to serve indicator / safety pressure plug.  My regulator weight jammed for some reason and the pressure plug did its thing.  The pressure plug (this kind of thing : [https://www.ennat.co.uk/pack-of-2-ready-to-serve-indicator-plugs-safety-valve-for-prestige-pressure-cookers](https://www.ennat.co.uk/pack-of-2-ready-to-serve-indicator-plugs-safety-valve-for-prestige-pressure-cookers) ) was a great design in that the metal thingy popped up extra high and released the excess steam in a fairly controlled manner and it was designed to be resettable.  And it occurred to me that I felt safer, because I now knew the safety mechanism actually worked, but it also occurred to me that until this happened, I had effectively been working with an untested safety feature with no guarantee that the cooker wouldn't fail before the safety plug activated.  The pressure-cooker was, after all, 30 or 40 years old and I can't be sure it had never been dropped or otherwise abused.\n\nPresige England used to claim it tested its pressure-cookers to 5 x the working pressure, which is reassuring if you have a new pressure-cooker.  Prestige has since been taken over by Meyer and the Burnley factory was closed, although I think a few spare parts for older models were made in the UK for a while... of really quite poor quality, sadly, but I digress.\n\nMy question is, especially for those of us who don't live in the United States and don't have a county extension office who do... whatever it is that they do, how can you know if your pressure cooker really has working safety features?\n\nEven if you had laboratory equipment and an explosion-proof container in which to conduct a pressure-test, to ensure the safety plug releases the pressure below a set threshold, this would not test under real-world conditions as the pressure-cooker is cold, not hot and full of steam, and, also, since some safety plugs are supposed to be replaced if they ever activate, then you still don't know if the new safety plug is going to work.\n\nAnd even if you could somehow, in this safe, laboratory test environment, test the pressure-cooker with steam, and trust that one safety plug is likely to be much the same as the one it replaces, can we even know if the very act of bringing the pressure-cooker or canner up to above its normal working pressure doesn't fatigue the metal to some degree with the result that the test itself may invisibly damage the canner and render it less safe?\n\nSince I posted a separate question about Presto pressure plugs and the need to phone the test kitchen, I have had an email back from National Presto Industries and basically, I was told the main issue with one of their pressure plugs being activated is that it could be damaged by being forced out, so it seems to me that they feel it is unlikely a properly-maintained canner would suffer from the kind of over-pressure that would force out a pressure plug, but that's only one manufacturer in many.\n\nThe question is academic with a new canner which has, hopefully, been factory-tested, but the very act of shipping it from the factory (often in China these days) may itself have damaged the canner in a way that may not be visible, so while it may have been safe at the factory, it may not be now.  With a second-hand canner that other people have used (even if it has always been in the family), its history is anyone's guess, and if a pressure plug has been allowed to go old and hard (and thus slower to do its job) by previous owners, there is always the risk that an overpressure situation may have resulted in a much higher overpressure than would be the case if the pressure plug had been renewed periodically.\n\nSo it seems to me that we effectively have no way of knowing whether a canner will explode or otherwise fail dangerously before the safety device (pressure plug or whatever device the particular model uses) is able to release the excess pressure.  Obviously the design is likely to be sound, and we can make a visual/tactile inspection of the safety mechanisms, but what we can't do (safety, anyway) is actually TEST them, nor can we test the canner or pressure-cooker itself.\n\nA lady I know was one of the people in charge of a computer server.  She wasn't technically-minded, but she asked the people who maintained the server how they knew the nightly back-up procedure worked.  For some reason the back-up was onto a tape, and this already was quite old-fashioned even then, but that was irrelevant, so long as it worked.  The other managers muttered that she was a stupid woman and of course it worked, but she held her ground and asked to have access to some of the backed-up files.  Turned out that the back-up procedure, which was supposed to safeguard crucial data, was not able to deliver a single functional file.  Nobody had tested it.  Think you will be able to see where I'm coming from with this question.\n\nWhat's your attitude to the whole thing and what do you do to feel safe?  Open-ended question.\n\n  \nEDIT - to clarify, by 'explode' I mean exactly that - not someone opened the lid when it was under pressure, not the vent suddenly opened and spurted out soup, and not the pressure plug popped out and vented, but actual explosion, such as if the lid flies off due to failure of the lugs that hold it on, or the sides of the pan tear open, metal fatigue... that kind of thing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1jwcwu1/so_how_do_we_know_if_our_overpressure_devices/", "created_utc": 1744330604.0, "score": 1, "author": "toiletboy2013", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1jwcwu1/so_how_do_we_know_if_our_overpressure_devices/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Question about roasted green salsa", "selftext": "Hello I am hoping to try a batch of the green salsa in the link. I quite like it because it has proportionally less lime juice and vinegar than the other two options I've found:\n\nhttps://www.ballmasonjars.com/blog?cid=tomatillo-salsa\n\nAnd \nhttps://mfp.ucanr.edu/Resources_/Recipes_and_Information/Recipe_Card_Library/Vegetable_Recipes_594/ -- I have tried this one and it tasted both too cumin forward (I can safely modify this in the future according to their instructions) and too intense for a line flavor for my family.\n\nHowever, I know my wife enjoys unroadted salsas better than roasted ines. So first question:\n\nIs it correct to assume that in the recipe linked (https://www.ballmasonjars.com/blog?cid=roasted-salsa-verde) one should NOT skip the roasting step? If so, could someone educate me into why? The recipe brings things to a simmer but I'm guessing that's not enough to pasteurize everything? I suppose boiling ingredients instead of roasting then would be theoretically possible but that feels like it's too far of a departure from the safe and tested recipe.\n\nSecond question: if I wanted to make 6 pint jars of this, is the best way to do it by prepping all of the ingredients and then bringing two pots to simmer? I saw in another post here that it's not safe to just straight up double recipes, though this one gives no set time for how long to simmer, so I would imagine it'd be okay to just simmer the double batch.\n\nAnyway, just trying to be safe here.

Apple sauce: I did use a pressure cooker to prep apples for the food mill and make apple sauce that way but realized I used too much water in that batch anyway and froze them. I am not sure if this is okay and leaning towards not doing it? That experience was a lesson in needing to follow recipes exactly.\n\n2: stock: For chicken stock I really like cooking it in the instant pot though and I really feel like in this case it would be okay?? The main argument for simmering seems to go out the window when you are canning lol\n\n3: beans: I\u2019m also wondering if I could use it to rehydrate beans for canning? Soaking and boiling is not a big deal but I really hate cooking beans from dry without the pressure cooker. This one seems like it could be okay but I\u2019m not confident.\n\nI would really appreciate advice.

Everyone back home \"bottles\" leftovers, usually in a way that I have recently learned is probably pretty unsafe. Excuse how long this may be. Any insight, resources, help, etc. would be AMAZING. Thanks in advance. \n\nSo, if my mom made a large pot of vegetable soup, unstuffed cabbage rolls, moose stew, chili etc (almost anything that didn't have dairy in it), she would heat the left overs to a boil that night, fill up her jars, close em tight and let them cool on the kitchen counter over night. We knew they were sealed when we heard all of the lids make a \"pop\" sound. Of course, when opened, each bottle is inspected, just in case. \n\nOh! And, all bottles, rims, and lids were re-used once or twice. I learned this wasn't good practice a few years ago and stopped doing it, but I thought I'd mention it.\n\nThis is how I store leftovers if I don't think we'll eat them before they spoil. This is how my mom and all of her sisters do it. How my grandmothers (mom's mom and dad's mom) did it. It's incredibly common where I'm from. \n\nIs this not safe?

I would love to be pointed toward those guidelines so I dont accidentally kill me and my husband when we eat my half-assed bottled leftovers. \ud83d\ude43\n\nNote: I can remember once in my childhood when my parents used a large pot to boil bottles full of moose meat. There was a rack at the bottom. I never asked why they did it differently that time around. \n\nAnyway.

Is there any risk of putting more water so I don't worry about running dry?\n\n2. The manual also says to vent for 7 minutes once you get a continuous stream of steam before placing the weight, but online most people recommend 10 minutes.

{"title": "Mold and food", "selftext": "The canning part is here, it's after this intro, I promise. \n\nCan I just cut off/ scrape off/ scoop out the mold? We should do a poll to see the percentage of us who wonder vs those who throw it away, just in case. While studying mycology at UC Davis, I took the opportunity to investigate a moldy poppy seeds muffins that had, and what we had learned was true: by the time you see the mold colony on top, the mold has completely filled the muffin with hyphae. Hyphae are the vegetative part of molds, you may have seen them in the garden and on wood chips and logs. After removing the outside layer of muffin, in case they grew down the sides, I cut out a chunk and put it under a disecting scope. Oh, wow. Hyphae everywhere. \n\nWhile researching an answer, I happened across the site for Clemson University's Coop Extension, which includes extensive food preservation information. On the jellied products ingredients page information page I found this: \n\n\"Preventing Spoilage of Jellies\n\nEven though sugar helps preserve jellies and jams, molds can grow on the surface of these products. Research now indicates that the mold people usually scrape off the surface of jellies may not be as harmless as it seems. \n\nMycotoxins have been found in some jars of jelly having surface mold growth. Mycotoxins are known to cause cancer in animals; their effects on humans are still being researched. Because of possible mold contamination, paraffin or wax seals are no longer recommended for any sweet spread, including jellies.\n\nAll jellied products should be processed in a boiling water bath to prevent mold growth.\"\n\nSo, although they haven't proven that mycotoxins cause cancer in humans, they have found that they do in animals. I'm going to go with the 'humans are animals with opposable thumbs and good p r' theory and will no longer scoop off the mold on jelly. \n\nI will note that when I find mold on my jelly, it is always on the low sugar stuff.

{"title": "Questions about syrup and prep for hot packing fruit", "selftext": "Hi I have just started canning and this question is about water bath canning fruit like sliced pineapple or pears in light syrup.\n\nI have followed the recipes a couple times with preparing syrup and pre cooking the fruit in syrup to hot pack. My concern is I have been using more syrup than needed because I want to cover the fruit during this step, but then I have waste (or at least jars of syrup in my fridge.)\n\n  \n1. Would it be safe to reuse the syrup, like if I do a batch of one fruit and prepare a batch of the second fruit while the first one is in the canner, could I just keep the leftover syrup and cook the next fruit in it and use it for hot packing? This seems okay, but it is not actually mentioned anywhere I have seen and I want to make sure I am okay.\n\n2. How do you deal with this? Should I just use less syrup, maybe preparing smaller batches as I go? It's a little more difficult in my small space because my canner pretty much takes up the whole stove top and I do my prep in the instant pot on saute in a different area. I guess I should just try using less since as long as it it is already hot when I put the fruit in it seems to look a lot better than the amount of water the fruit is staged in.\n\nSorry these are pretty basic, but this is one area where I don't like trying to dredge info from google, with the quality of the content these days!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1ji3qu0/questions_about_syrup_and_prep_for_hot_packing/", "created_utc": 1742748761.0, "score": 7, "author": "bobertlo", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1ji3qu0/questions_about_syrup_and_prep_for_hot_packing/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Can I use these lids?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, first time post, hope you can answer this.  I cleaned out an old home that was left by an elderly woman who was into canning, and she left dozens of mason jars of all sizes, many unused in the original boxes, and boxes of what appear to be new rings and lids.  Many of the lids were in new closed boxes.  BUT they were left on the counters out in the open, and the house was infested with hundreds of mice that had peed and left droppings everywhere.  \n\nOf course I washed the jars in the dishwasher, but also all the rings and lids in the top rack.  In reading now I realize I should have just hand washed the lids, but everything was covered in mouse pee and fly specs and I wanted to be sure.  After washing I checked that the lids were dry and sealed them in plastic bags.  I did NOT separate out the lids that were new in boxes with what appeared to be new lids left in stacks on the counter where the mice had been playing, assuming they were all new.  That was a few years ago and now that I\u2019m retiring I wanted to learn canning.  \n\nMy wife thinks it\u2019s silly (\u201cthere\u2019s always Safeway!\u201d) but I was raised LDS and both my parents canned peaches and pears and other fruit every year (we lived in San Jose, CA in the \u201860\u2019s and people don\u2019t remember how much fruit the valley used to produce before they bulldozed it all and renamed it Silicon Valley!) \n\nSo, I want to start as even though I\u2019m no longer in the church I value being prepared.

Does that include eggs as an ingredient?\n\nHere's an example of a recipe I commonly use:\n\n>Ingredients  \n\n>5 pounds 90% lean ground beef (do not use fattier meats)\n\n>2 pounds beef heart\n\n>1 pound beef liver\n\n>8 pasture-raised eggs without shells (could be reserved and added at the time of feeding if necessary for canning purposes)\n\n>8 ounces kale\n\n>8 ounces broccoli\n\n>8 ounces dandelion greens\n\n>12 ounces blueberries or mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and cranberries)\n\n>5 tbsp bone meal (seaweed calcium can be used for adult dogs)\n\n>2 tsp wheat germ oil (added at time of feeding)\n\n>2 tsp himalayan salt\n\n>1/4 tsp kelp\n\nThe underlying nutritional breakdown is very specific and well-balanced. I'm not concerned about the recipe, but I'd like to know how to safely make it shelf stable using pressure canning.

Am I reading this instruction right? Are only pearl onions safe? WHY?! Is everyone on this sub following what seems to be a safe French onion soup recipe from Ball only using pearl onions? If not, what are the safety tolerances for normal, full-sized onions?\n\nI am tickled by this in part because on the Jewish side of my family (a bunch of women), there's a joke that Jewish women love HUGE onions.

So we went to our local supplies shop here in regional Western Australia and they had some Kilner jars (\"original and best\"), so we bought some in each size and got started.  That was the only brand available.\n\nAt some point while canning tomatoes we noticed that the wide mouth 1/2 pint jars and the wide mouth pint jars rings are a slightly different diameter, basically the rings for the smaller jars won't fit on the larger jars.  Annoying and not as advertised, but not the end of the world I suppose.  Canning tomatoes went pretty smoothly, using mostly the larger pint jars.\n\nBut the other day I got access to a cheap 10kg of capsicums and decided to pressure can them.  Apart from a siphoning issue which I'm putting down to user error, after cooling, most of the bands are stuck tight. They can be unscrewed about halfway, but then they start to bind and it takes a lot of force to get them off (these are the bands that came with the jars so not a size mismatch, also they screwed on lovely).  One of the jars seals popped up after finally getting the ring off (I saw someone else complaining about this here too).  I've put all the jars in the fridge with rings for now and we're going to eat them ASAP.  I used the 1/2 pint jars.\n\nI'm wondering what to do going forward.  Ball jars don't seem to be readily available in Australia although not impossible to get, very pricy especially with shipping.  If I got some of those, would the rings fit the Kilner jars?

{"title": "A few canning safety questions", "selftext": "I've canned a few different tomato and tomatillo recipes from the healthy canning website.\n\nOne thing I find a bit tough is how specific (most) recipes are to make a safe product - I love cooking, but I love it for the creativity. I haven't really enjoyed canning - for years I've stuck with lactofermentation for preservation this reason! (I'm not opposed to technical food projects - I brew mead, for example, with a lot of care paid to all technical parameters, but there's still a lot of room for flexibility).\n\nBut of course, canning offers a much wider array of flavour possibilities. So 2 quick questions, after spending too much time wading through lengthy threads and blog posts and not feeling any clearer:\n\n**1) Pressure canning** \n\nam I correct in understanding that, provided I follow proper processes (e.g. those outlined on HealthyCanning), *anything* can be pressure canned? I.e. would this expensive piece of equipment let me be a bit more creative?\n\n**2) pH testing for sauces** \n\nMy understanding is that safe water bath canning requires a pH below 4. However, the reason we can't just make up our own recipes and use test strips is that the centre of *x vegetable* may not be at the required acidity. Folks in the hot sauce community *do* seem to make their own recipes up and essentially can them for shelf stability, after pH testing. Is this considered a safe practice, as we're making the product essentially liquid - i.e. we can reliably test the pH with strips (or a meter)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1j3wlnn/a_few_canning_safety_questions/", "created_utc": 1741154988.0, "score": 1, "author": "oreocereus", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1j3wlnn/a_few_canning_safety_questions/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I've never canned anything before and didn't grow up in a family where canning was common (besides my grandma making freezer jam every year), so am a little nervous about wanting to make sure I do everything right so it is safe!\n\nI picked three recipes for my first experiments that I chose because they all use things that are easy to get at the grocery store in these winter months.  I was reading through the recipes today and have a few newbie questions about each that I'm hoping someone can clarify for me.\n\n**Grape Jelly**\n\nI bought the Bernardin Complete Book of Home Preserving and I think the recipe on pg 112 has an error because it says 3oz/177ml of liquid pectin is required. Looking at the other recipes on the page, 177ml should be 6oz of pectin? And [the online version of the recipe ](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/grape-juice-jelly.htm)looks to be halved and lists 88.5ml of liquid pectin which would actually be 3oz but for half the amount of juice/sugar listed in the recipe book? Just want confirmation that I\u2019m not reading things wrong because it feels bold to look at my first recipe and assume there is an error in the book and not just me misunderstanding something haha\n\n\n\n**Jellied Cranberry Sauce**\n\nPlanning to make the recipe from pg 177 of the Bernardin book. My cranberries are frozen and I see it mentions thawing in the refrigerator first but doesn\u2019t mention if I should include any liquid or not. Some of the recipes for other fruit jams/jellies elsewhere in the book have mentioned saving and including any liquid from the fruit as it thaws in the recipe, would it be safe to assume the same here? ie I should measure out the amount frozen, thaw them in a bowl in the fridge, and then dump the whole thing into my pot to cook down?\n\n\n\n**Applesauce**\n\nPlanning to make the recipe from pg 180 of the Bernardin book.\u00a0\n\n\\- Am I safe to half a recipe if I want to based on the amount of apples I have as long as keep the lemon juice amount proportional?\n\n\\- The bottled lemon juice that I got at the store says it is from concentrate and the ingredients list: water, lemon juice concentrate (sulphites), lemon oil, sodium benzoate, and dimethicone. Is this what I should be using when it says \u201cbottled lemon juice\u201d or do I need to try to track down something more pure/not from concentrate?\n\n  \nThank you so much for any insights/help you can offer!\n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1izr68n/brand_new_to_canning_with_a_few_recipe_questions/", "created_utc": 1740692123.0, "score": 4, "author": "ocean--eyes", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1izr68n/brand_new_to_canning_with_a_few_recipe_questions/", "html_title": ""}

Now I have lots of questions.", "selftext": "I asked for a low sugar lemon marmalade recipe last week and you guys really helped me figure out how to make it! I've made two batches so far, and I've completely fallen in love with making my own marmalade. I was terrified of canning anything and now I want to make all kinds of jams. \n\nI borrowed the canning equipment to make the lemon marmalade, but now I want my own. I looked on Amazon but I'm having a hard time choosing a kit. I'm just very overwhelmed and struggling to figure out which kits have a wire rack that will work well with small jars. As of right now, the only thing I see myself making and canning is jams and marmalades in small jars and the recipe book I bought warned that a lot of the racks have wide spacing that doesn't work well with small jars. I also want a kit that has the head measuring tool included and that isn't as commons as I thought it would have been. I also want a pot big enough for 6 small jars. The pot I borrowed could only fit 5 so every batch I made had one jar that was left out. \n\nSince the recipe I used made 6 jars and the pot could only fit 5, I was wondering if anyone had an idea of how long the 6th jar would be good for. I just left it on the counter the entire time, so it never went into the water bath. The lid however did go in the heated water and both times it seems to have sealed as the button on the lid is down. \n\nOn my second batch, when I pulled the jars out of the water bath after putting the lids on, I noticed air bubbles going to the top of the jar on one of the jars I pulled out. It seemed like the jar was pure liquid and that made me super nervous. When I checked it the next day it seemed to be the right texture, though I didn't break the seal on the jar to find out for sure.

{"title": "Ornate jars that are safe?", "selftext": "Hello! I am new here. I am hoping to get more into home canning and food preservation as I do food-garden seasonally, home-cook a lot, and am always wanting to learn more skills in the kitchen.\n\nIn advance, I would like to apologize if this post is not appropriate, or if I at any time fail to make sense. I have a tendency to ramble and over-explain. Thank you for your patience!\n\nI am unfortunately a very erm... aesthetics-concerned individual. I am an artist so that very well may be part of the reason. I would like to note I am not opposed to using standard shaped canning jars. I would simply like to explore my options if there are any.\n\nI have canned a grand total of once, improperly, and my success rate was mixed. One jar of preserves canned properly and kept excellently, the other molded. (Boo, but alas, for a first time try, not too bad having one of two small jars turn out okay.)\n\nI am interested in working with fruits and veg of course, however as someone who dabbles in various categories of cookery (with a family oft favoring my baking), sweet things like jams and jellies are probably more priority.\n\nMy question, of course, is this: are there any known, tried and true brands that produce ornate (pretty, visually interesting, etc.) jars for canning? I'm talking about faceted shapes, fruit shapes, fun external decor like flowers, fruit, etc.?\n\nAs I've said before I am not opposed to using standard shapes if that is what is most recommended. I also would like to note that I likely would not be practicing canning in such ornate jars, I would use them once I was more confident in my abilities (think of it like an incentive to strive toward!) so as to lower the likelihood of disaster (jars self destructing, etc.)\n\nThank you for any help, pointers, links/urls, etc. Also apologies for my flowery, flamboyant way of typing if it is a bother.

What she writes for storing the jams is as follows:\n\n\"Before making jam, I sterilize the jars, either by putting them in boiling water for a few minutes or by putting them in a 255F oven for 5 minutes. As soon as the jam has finished cooking, I fill the jars, using the small lade and the jam funnel. I fill them right up to the top. Any drips should be carefully wiped off. I close the jars while they are hot and turn them upside down. I wait until they are cool to put the labels on and then put the jars in a cool, dry place, out of the light.\"\n\nAgain, this is not a canning or preservation book, but a book of recipes for jams. Most of the recipes call for lemon juice in the way that jam recipes typically do.

{"title": "Advice? Do you tell someone their canning is unsafe?", "selftext": "So, backstory: I just moved to a rural area to start my homestead dream and posted on a local FB page asking about some local resources. Enter \u201cFarmer Joe\u201d (not his real name.) We chatted a bit and he seemed to have a handle on a bunch of great resources in the area etc. He offered to host me at his \u201cfarm\u201d for a dinner. I agree. Turns out he\u2019s not really a farmer and just a joke because he lives in a historic farmhouse and uses his lot to grow hay. \n\nOkay skipping ahead. The guy is very sweet, kinda struck me as sad, lonely widow. He gave me a gift of a couple of homemade canned soups. I am not a super experienced canner, at most I\u2019ve canned a few tomatoes. But since I\u2019m planning on being a homesteader I read A LOT (and learn a lot about being in this sub)! I asked how he canned them immediately. He essentially just did a water bath. I mentioned that they probably weren\u2019t shelf stable and he INSISTED they were SUPER hot and the jars were sterilized. I ask if there was any acid like lemon or vinegar in the recipes and he said no. They were a red lentil and a carrot, ginger with coconut milk. They weren\u2019t refrigerated or anything (if he made them last week and they stayed in the fridge I would have been more okay with it.) \n\nAt any rate, I accepted and threw them straight in my compost later on. \n\nSo my question is - I don\u2019t want to offend this guy, like I said he\u2019s a sweet, lonely widow in his 60s and he was trying to do something sweet/kind. But should I tell him that I wouldn\u2019t eat them because his canning practices are unsafe?\n\nI don\u2019t get the impression he\u2019s running around giving gifts of canned soups to every one.

{"title": "Help understanding the science behind why adding extra 'safety features' to a recipe is a no-go... or is it?", "selftext": "I\u2019m a couple of years into pressure canning now and I\u2019m running up against some frustrations that have been brought up by others in post that are archived and/or weren\u2019t really resolved. Hoping some of you can shed some light on the whys.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWorth noting a few things upfront:\n\n1) I\u2019m not looking to cut corners. Food safety is extremely important, as are the official orgs. in charge of it. This isn\u2019t me looking to go rogue and get some crunchy botulism to spite the powers that be.\u00a0\n\n2) I\u2019m not looking for permission to do what I\u2019m proposing. I just want to understand why it\u2019s a bad idea, if in fact it is. No one has told me it's unsafe. I just haven't been able to find any concrete info to understand how or why it would be (aside from it not being a meticulously-followed tested recipe).\n\n3) I don\u2019t care about reducing salt, fat or sugar. Those are excellent food preservation tools, and also very tasty. No shame to anyone who\u2019s doing a low-sodium/fat/sugar diet. There are a million good reasons to go that route, that\u2019s just not what I\u2019m after here. It\u2019s annoying to keep getting stonewalled by explanations that canning recipes don\u2019t need those elements when I\u2019ve been struggling to find answers to more nuanced questions involving keeping them in to improve safety and flavour.\n\n4) I have not done what I\u2019m asking about nor am I encouraging anyone to.\n\n\n\nMy frustrations are rooted in not being able to find scientifically-backed reasoning for why we\u2019re told not to make certain adjustments to recipes, when there\u2019s so much room for variance in a lot of the official recipes out there.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOfficial tested recipes give varying results depending on a whole range of factors like:\n\n\\- Measurements in cups rather than weight.\u00a0\n\n\\- Exact food piece sizes, quality of the ingredient, different cultivars, etc. all impact the density of the food being measured by cup, thereby changing the real amount of the ingredient used.\n\n\\- Syrups in some official fruit preservation recipes being a \u2018choose your own adventure.\u2019 No accounting for density, sugar content, etc. at all when recipes outright say you can swap other syrups in.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI understand that official recipes have margins of error built into them for ingredient variances. That makes sense and I agree that they should do that. But it\u2019s frustrating to mainly find recipes that would require me to totally change how and what I cook in order to can anything other than single, raw ingredients.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s use chicken stock as an example:\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s say I make my own chicken stock my own way, with more salt than a lot of the official recipes call for and without cooling to skim off the fat, but otherwise a similar liquid-only product. I pressure can that DIY stock following all best practices. I leave the same 1\u201d head space that\u2019s given for stock recipes. I use the correct pressure for my elevation, follow all canner instructions perfectly, etc. and can for a length of time beyond what any stock recipes list. Let\u2019s go big and say 120 minutes rather than a more standard \\~25 min just to be safe.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHow is that not safer than the USDA\u2019s or any other official recipe? And if the 120 minutes isn\u2019t long enough, then what\u2019s the longest canning time given for any existing approved recipe? Why would that extreme length of time not be safe for something that\u2019s less dense and saltier than plenty of other foods that can be safely canned? What variables am I not considering that could cause my stock to not reach a high enough temperature for a long enough period of time to be safe?\n\n\n\nDensity - I understand that adjusting recipes can change the density of the product, and that would in turn affect the required canning time to make it safe. But if my changes add in additional layers of safety, in this case salt, fat and a canning time far beyond any stock recipe, what\u2019s the reasoning for this approach being unsafe?\u00a0\n\n\n\nFlat sour - Would the intensive canning time with a higher peak temp not be enough to kill off those \u2018heat-happy\u2019 bacteria too since 250F is enough to take all those species out? And even if I got unlucky and ended up with a batch contaminated with an especially heat-resistant strain, there\u2019s no health risk to the food going off. I\u2019d take a rare bad-tasting batch over not being able to can my own stock ever.\n\n\n\nSiphoning - I\u2019d be fine with some siphoning loss, no more than the \u2018half the liquid\u2019 rule (though does this still matter if there aren\u2019t any solids needing to be submerged anyway?). If this was the only potential issue, experimenting with above-guideline canning times to find a sweet spot that doesn\u2019t result in excessive loss would feel like a win.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAcidity - Would that not be balanced out by salt content and extreme canning time too? Tbh I\u2019d even be open to pH testing my own stock for a few batches and adding some acid (e.g.: tomatoes) if need be, but without any safety baseline for a given recipe, that\u2019s fairly moot. And this is pressure canning so the stocks in the approved recipes have low acidity anyway.\n\n\n\nI understand why public health orgs give blunt, heavy-handed rules that can feel like overkill. If they don\u2019t do that, more people get sick and die. Populations en masse aren\u2019t good with complex, nuanced instructions.\n\n\n\nBut as someone who got into the food preservation game through fermenting, where you learn the rules & science and can then improvise within that framework without issue, the shift to canning has felt impractically restrictive. Like I\u2019m not going to boil a whole chicken and measure out exactly the right amounts of only the ingredients listed in a recipe just to make stock. There\u2019s a stock bag in our freezer with veg & bones collected from making other meals. When it\u2019s full, I make stock that I simmer for at least 6 hours to get the collagen to breakdown. I want to can that!\n\n\n\nOr does this really just boil down to the fact that my stock wouldn\u2019t have been officially tested, and the safety of the adjustments made isn\u2019t something a more seasoned canner would even consider taking into account?\n\n\n\nFor reference, these are some of the earlier threads I\u2019m referring to:\n\n\\- https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/186t8va/frustration\\_with\\_safe\\_canning\\_practices\\_and/\n\n\\- https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1kyp6d/couldnt\\_any\\_recipe\\_or\\_item\\_be\\_canned\\_with\\_a/\n\n\\- https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1hseqgn/do\\_you\\_have\\_to\\_use\\_specific\\_recipes\\_for\\_canning/\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my rant.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1ick6v0/help_understanding_the_science_behind_why_adding/", "created_utc": 1738119941.0, "score": 1, "author": "andanampersandawn", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1ick6v0/help_understanding_the_science_behind_why_adding/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "From OSU Extension Office: Floral Jellies", "selftext": "So a PSA here about the safety of dandelion jelly had me reaching out to my local extension office. This is because I had just steaped both a Dandelion tea and a Grape Hyacinth tea for the purpose of creating a jelly. Specifically: I had zero intention of putting any of the petals into the final product. I've included OSU's response here:\n\nThanks for reaching out about herbal and floral jellies. There has been a lot of chatter and disagreement online recently about these products, but fortunately there are several good options for tested canning recipes available. \n\nFirst, a bit of explanation. Anytime we are considering canning something, we have to think about the final acidity of the product. High acid ingredients, like most berries, are generally safe to can in a boiling water canner because their naturally low pH prevents pathogens like Clostridium botulinum from growing when stored at room temperature. Herbs and flowers, however, are not naturally high acid ingredients, and we have to use tested canning recipes that control pathogen growth by adding acid (lowering the pH), adding sugar (binding up moisture), or some combination of these two techniques. This is true even if you are creating a tea from the herbs that is very well strained. The tea itself is likely not acidic enough to prevent pathogen growth. To be safe for canning, you would need to add a tested amount of acid (like lemon juice), sugar, or a combination of the two.\n\nFortunately, some recipes for herbal or floral jellies have been tested for canning. Two commercial pectin producers have recipes online for floral or herbal infusion jellies for canning. Pectin manufacturers test their recipes to ensure that enough acid, sugar, or some combination of the two is added to make the product safe for canning. [Ball/Bernardin](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US) has a flexible herb jelly recipe that uses vinegar as an acidulant, and Pomona's Pectin has both an [herb jelly](https://pomonapectin.com/herb-jelly/) and a [floral ](https://pomonapectin.com/rose-petal-jelly-2/)jelly that use lemon juice as an acidulant. The companies listing these recipes both state that different culinary herbs or edible flowers can be substituted for the original ingredients.\n\nDue to the low acidity of many herbal and floral ingredients, it would not be safe to can an herbal or floral jelly using recipes that were originally formulated for high acid ingredients like fruits and berries. Freezing these modified jam or jelly recipes rather than canning them is a safe alternative for storage. The University of Wyoming has a recipe online for a [dandelion freezer jelly](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uwyoextension.org/uwnutrition/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dandelion-Jelly.pdf&source=gmail&ust=1745683604628000&usg=AOvVaw3hohjwE1hMQ3X562FOUczn) that is similar to what you suggest for freezer storage.\n\nSo, in short, you have options, but make sure that you only can a jelly with a low acid ingredient if the recipe has been tested for safety.\n\nThanks for using Ask Extension!\n\nJared\n\n\n\nSo for us foragers out there, we do have options for our flower and herbal jelly's but always make sure you're using a tested recipe. \n\nReiterating a passage from above: The companies listing these recipes both state that different culinary herbs or edible flowers can be substituted for the original ingredients.\nLinks for recipes:\n[Ball/Bernardin Herb Jelly](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US)\n\n[Pomona's Pectin herb jelly jelly](https://pomonapectin.com/herb-jelly/)\n[Pomona's Pectin floral jelly](https://pomonapectin.com/rose-petal-jelly-2/)\n\nPDF  [University of Wyoming dandelion freezer jelly](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uwyoextension.org/uwnutrition/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dandelion-Jelly.pdf&source=gmail&ust=1745683604628000&usg=AOvVaw3hohjwE1hMQ3X562FOUczn) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1k7pf9r/from_osu_extension_office_floral_jellies/", "created_utc": 1745599000.0, "score": 10, "author": "SeaPomegranateBliss", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1k7pf9r/from_osu_extension_office_floral_jellies/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

See the VERY BOTTOM of this post for a late April update that includes TWO exceptions for very SPECIFIC recipes. \n\n**That list includes but is not limited to**:\n\n* Dandelion Jelly\n* Redbud Jelly\n* Cherry Blossom Jelly\n* Magnolia Jelly\n* Violet Jelly\n* Lilac Jelly\n\nThese jellies (like all experimental jellies) can only be made safely as \"refrigerator\" or \"freezer\" jellies. If making as a fridge / freezer project, do not process in your waterbath canner. It is a waste of time, energy & lids, adds nothing to the safety or perishability of the food, and may lead another person to mistakenly believe the jelly to be shelf stable.  \n\nIf you'd like to know more, please keep reading! Post questions below!\n\n**We understand you may have a recipe or a link you have used before. If your Floral Jelly recipe was posted or printed before 2024, it is no longer considered safe.**\n\nHere's the science:\n\nThe acidity of these jellies is not low enough to prevent growth of botulism spores **and** the water activity (even at a 1:1 sugar to water ratio) is potentially high enough to still allow for microbial growth. [Both University of Wyoming and University of California agree on this](https://ask.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=862444). The problem is that these two original floral jelly recipe bulletins got posted in MANY places online and trying to take them all down is like playing whack-a-mole. What's worse is that plenty of 'Cowboy Canners' took the original recipes and thought, *\"Well, if I can do dandylions, I should be able to do ALL edible flowers!\"* and created tons of visually pleasing but potentially gastric-upsetting blogs and social media posts.\n\nMake your florals if you enjoy them and put them in the fridge or freezer.\n\n  \nEDIT: Adding more content on April 29, 2025 [https://ask.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=898495](https://ask.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=898495)\n\nWe have a few options.\n\nBall/Bernadin HERBAL jelly with vinegar [https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/herb-jelly.htm?Lang=EN-US) and Pomona's Floral and Herbal are both good to go!

{"title": "Homemade applesauce from my mom, is it safe to eat?", "selftext": "Hello! I don't know much about canning, but my mom gave me this jar of applesauce she made sometime in the past couple months and I'm wondering if it's safe to eat?\n\nSome details about the jar and canning process:\n\n* Before opening it leaked a little bit of liquid, I suspect she maybe overfilled the jar and some came out around the lid but not really sure. It was kind of brown and sticky, so probably just like sugary liquid. \n* I just opened it and there's some mold around the outside of the jar under the lid. There's no visible mold on the inside, and the top of the rim looks clean, so maybe had a proper seal anyways and is safe? \n* The inside of the lid has mold and rust on the outer parts, past where the seal would be. The applesauce on the lid looks fine other than one spot where there are some very small dark spots, which is probably the thing I'm most concerned about.\n* The taste is fine but slightly acidic or something? I can't exactly place the taste as it's very very slight, and could even just be the normal taste of the applesauce even before canning. It makes me wonder if it could have slightly fermented, or if it could be something else that could be dangerous. The taste isn't strong or bad enough for me to say if it's gone bad, I do notice from taste and smell when fresh food has spoiled, like with dairy products, produce, etc.\n* My mom pretty regularly makes jams and other canned products at home and I can't remember a time where something was canned improperly so that the contents became unsafe to eat. From what I remember as a kid she heats the jars and lids in the oven to sterilize them and fills them with the warm jam or applesauce. I think she does something else after filling the jars, but not quite sure, then stores them in a cool, dark place.\n* This batch was stored in our cellar, which has some moisture and possibly mold issues, which could be the cause of the mold in the lid.\n\n  \nSince I don't know much about canning and food safety I'm not sure if this is enough to make it unsafe to consume (slightly paranoid about botulism haha), so if anyone has any insight it would be very helpful!

I have two concerns:\n\n1- Is the extra starchyness a potential sign that something went wrong in my attempt at following the recipe?\n\n2- Does the \"mush\" at the bottom mean that there could have been potentially not enough water circulating around the beans to properly pasteurize everything? Or is this a normal event in home canned beans due to the long time pressure canning them (75 minutes), so some beans will always open up and fall through the bottom but the whole jar will still be safe to eat?

{"title": "So... how *do* we know if our over-pressure devices really work?", "selftext": "Many years ago, I had an older-style Prestige England (not TTK Prestige India) aluminium pressure-cooker with a combined ready to serve indicator / safety pressure plug.  My regulator weight jammed for some reason and the pressure plug did its thing.  The pressure plug (this kind of thing : [https://www.ennat.co.uk/pack-of-2-ready-to-serve-indicator-plugs-safety-valve-for-prestige-pressure-cookers](https://www.ennat.co.uk/pack-of-2-ready-to-serve-indicator-plugs-safety-valve-for-prestige-pressure-cookers) ) was a great design in that the metal thingy popped up extra high and released the excess steam in a fairly controlled manner and it was designed to be resettable.  And it occurred to me that I felt safer, because I now knew the safety mechanism actually worked, but it also occurred to me that until this happened, I had effectively been working with an untested safety feature with no guarantee that the cooker wouldn't fail before the safety plug activated.  The pressure-cooker was, after all, 30 or 40 years old and I can't be sure it had never been dropped or otherwise abused.\n\nPresige England used to claim it tested its pressure-cookers to 5 x the working pressure, which is reassuring if you have a new pressure-cooker.  Prestige has since been taken over by Meyer and the Burnley factory was closed, although I think a few spare parts for older models were made in the UK for a while... of really quite poor quality, sadly, but I digress.\n\nMy question is, especially for those of us who don't live in the United States and don't have a county extension office who do... whatever it is that they do, how can you know if your pressure cooker really has working safety features?\n\nEven if you had laboratory equipment and an explosion-proof container in which to conduct a pressure-test, to ensure the safety plug releases the pressure below a set threshold, this would not test under real-world conditions as the pressure-cooker is cold, not hot and full of steam, and, also, since some safety plugs are supposed to be replaced if they ever activate, then you still don't know if the new safety plug is going to work.\n\nAnd even if you could somehow, in this safe, laboratory test environment, test the pressure-cooker with steam, and trust that one safety plug is likely to be much the same as the one it replaces, can we even know if the very act of bringing the pressure-cooker or canner up to above its normal working pressure doesn't fatigue the metal to some degree with the result that the test itself may invisibly damage the canner and render it less safe?\n\nSince I posted a separate question about Presto pressure plugs and the need to phone the test kitchen, I have had an email back from National Presto Industries and basically, I was told the main issue with one of their pressure plugs being activated is that it could be damaged by being forced out, so it seems to me that they feel it is unlikely a properly-maintained canner would suffer from the kind of over-pressure that would force out a pressure plug, but that's only one manufacturer in many.\n\nThe question is academic with a new canner which has, hopefully, been factory-tested, but the very act of shipping it from the factory (often in China these days) may itself have damaged the canner in a way that may not be visible, so while it may have been safe at the factory, it may not be now.  With a second-hand canner that other people have used (even if it has always been in the family), its history is anyone's guess, and if a pressure plug has been allowed to go old and hard (and thus slower to do its job) by previous owners, there is always the risk that an overpressure situation may have resulted in a much higher overpressure than would be the case if the pressure plug had been renewed periodically.\n\nSo it seems to me that we effectively have no way of knowing whether a canner will explode or otherwise fail dangerously before the safety device (pressure plug or whatever device the particular model uses) is able to release the excess pressure.  Obviously the design is likely to be sound, and we can make a visual/tactile inspection of the safety mechanisms, but what we can't do (safety, anyway) is actually TEST them, nor can we test the canner or pressure-cooker itself.\n\nA lady I know was one of the people in charge of a computer server.  She wasn't technically-minded, but she asked the people who maintained the server how they knew the nightly back-up procedure worked.  For some reason the back-up was onto a tape, and this already was quite old-fashioned even then, but that was irrelevant, so long as it worked.  The other managers muttered that she was a stupid woman and of course it worked, but she held her ground and asked to have access to some of the backed-up files.  Turned out that the back-up procedure, which was supposed to safeguard crucial data, was not able to deliver a single functional file.  Nobody had tested it.  Think you will be able to see where I'm coming from with this question.\n\nWhat's your attitude to the whole thing and what do you do to feel safe?  Open-ended question.\n\n  \nEDIT - to clarify, by 'explode' I mean exactly that - not someone opened the lid when it was under pressure, not the vent suddenly opened and spurted out soup, and not the pressure plug popped out and vented, but actual explosion, such as if the lid flies off due to failure of the lugs that hold it on, or the sides of the pan tear open, metal fatigue... that kind of thing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1jwcwu1/so_how_do_we_know_if_our_overpressure_devices/", "created_utc": 1744330604.0, "score": 1, "author": "toiletboy2013", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1jwcwu1/so_how_do_we_know_if_our_overpressure_devices/", "html_title": ""}

Apple sauce: I did use a pressure cooker to prep apples for the food mill and make apple sauce that way but realized I used too much water in that batch anyway and froze them. I am not sure if this is okay and leaning towards not doing it? That experience was a lesson in needing to follow recipes exactly.\n\n2: stock: For chicken stock I really like cooking it in the instant pot though and I really feel like in this case it would be okay?? The main argument for simmering seems to go out the window when you are canning lol\n\n3: beans: I\u2019m also wondering if I could use it to rehydrate beans for canning? Soaking and boiling is not a big deal but I really hate cooking beans from dry without the pressure cooker. This one seems like it could be okay but I\u2019m not confident.\n\nI would really appreciate advice. I am trying to stay 100% by the book and have not been canning with these methods, but these kinds of exceptions seem reasonable to ask about (but not go off and do on my own!)\n\nEdit: also I\u2019d really like to know about stock for use in other recipes. I feel like if you can use commercial stock and better than bullion it really should be fine to pressure cook it without exact recipes but would love confirmation.

Thanks in advance. \n\nSo, if my mom made a large pot of vegetable soup, unstuffed cabbage rolls, moose stew, chili etc (almost anything that didn't have dairy in it), she would heat the left overs to a boil that night, fill up her jars, close em tight and let them cool on the kitchen counter over night. We knew they were sealed when we heard all of the lids make a \"pop\" sound. Of course, when opened, each bottle is inspected, just in case. \n\nOh! And, all bottles, rims, and lids were re-used once or twice. I learned this wasn't good practice a few years ago and stopped doing it, but I thought I'd mention it.\n\nThis is how I store leftovers if I don't think we'll eat them before they spoil. This is how my mom and all of her sisters do it. How my grandmothers (mom's mom and dad's mom) did it. It's incredibly common where I'm from. \n\nIs this not safe? Have we been tempting fate for generations? As Newfies we have a pretty extensive history of food preservation between bottling, curing, and drying food (mainly with the help of salt), so I'm just wondering what the general concensus is on this method? \n\nI assume you good folks follow some sort of guidelines? I would love to be pointed toward those guidelines so I dont accidentally kill me and my husband when we eat my half-assed bottled leftovers. \ud83d\ude43\n\nNote: I can remember once in my childhood when my parents used a large pot to boil bottles full of moose meat.

The manual online for the 925 recommends 1.5\" of water at the bottom of the canner to start, but everything I read online says to use 2-3\" of water. Is there any risk of putting more water so I don't worry about running dry?\n\n2. The manual also says to vent for 7 minutes once you get a continuous stream of steam before placing the weight, but online most people recommend 10 minutes. Any risk to doing 10 minutes just to be sure?\n\n3. The manual description of the [over-pressure plug](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71C2khGVjTL.jpg) doesn't match my device. On my canner the relief plus looks more like a metal bolt (similar to what is in [the redditor's photo](https://preview.redd.it/6pw1l02ra8p61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f7b98f4b37fdd1f6d0e8b40c33bd9992f15f72b).) From what I have read online this has a ball inside and if \"activated\" will no longer function. If I do a test on my canner and it holds pressure, do I need to worry about it being functional?\n\n4. Several sources online have said not to use any metal utensil as a debubbler. Why is that? If I want to avoid plastic, can I use silicon or wood?\n\n5. From what I have read online, all dried and shelled beans have the same processing time. Can I can multiple varieties of beans (in separate, same sized jars) together? (I.e. 3 jars of black beans, 3 jars of kidney beans.)\n\n6. Not planning to do this now, but say in the future I have one vegetable that needs processed for 60 minutes and one that needs processed for 75 minutes.

We should do a poll to see the percentage of us who wonder vs those who throw it away, just in case. While studying mycology at UC Davis, I took the opportunity to investigate a moldy poppy seeds muffins that had, and what we had learned was true: by the time you see the mold colony on top, the mold has completely filled the muffin with hyphae. Hyphae are the vegetative part of molds, you may have seen them in the garden and on wood chips and logs. After removing the outside layer of muffin, in case they grew down the sides, I cut out a chunk and put it under a disecting scope. Oh, wow. Hyphae everywhere. \n\nWhile researching an answer, I happened across the site for Clemson University's Coop Extension, which includes extensive food preservation information. On the jellied products ingredients page information page I found this: \n\n\"Preventing Spoilage of Jellies\n\nEven though sugar helps preserve jellies and jams, molds can grow on the surface of these products. Research now indicates that the mold people usually scrape off the surface of jellies may not be as harmless as it seems. \n\nMycotoxins have been found in some jars of jelly having surface mold growth. Mycotoxins are known to cause cancer in animals; their effects on humans are still being researched. Because of possible mold contamination, paraffin or wax seals are no longer recommended for any sweet spread, including jellies.\n\nAll jellied products should be processed in a boiling water bath to prevent mold growth.\"\n\nSo, although they haven't proven that mycotoxins cause cancer in humans, they have found that they do in animals. I'm going to go with the 'humans are animals with opposable thumbs and good p r' theory and will no longer scoop off the mold on jelly. \n\nI will note that when I find mold on my jelly, it is always on the low sugar stuff.

{"title": "Can I use these lids?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, first time post, hope you can answer this.  I cleaned out an old home that was left by an elderly woman who was into canning, and she left dozens of mason jars of all sizes, many unused in the original boxes, and boxes of what appear to be new rings and lids.  Many of the lids were in new closed boxes.  BUT they were left on the counters out in the open, and the house was infested with hundreds of mice that had peed and left droppings everywhere.  \n\nOf course I washed the jars in the dishwasher, but also all the rings and lids in the top rack.  In reading now I realize I should have just hand washed the lids, but everything was covered in mouse pee and fly specs and I wanted to be sure.  After washing I checked that the lids were dry and sealed them in plastic bags.  I did NOT separate out the lids that were new in boxes with what appeared to be new lids left in stacks on the counter where the mice had been playing, assuming they were all new.  That was a few years ago and now that I\u2019m retiring I wanted to learn canning.  \n\nMy wife thinks it\u2019s silly (\u201cthere\u2019s always Safeway!\u201d) but I was raised LDS and both my parents canned peaches and pears and other fruit every year (we lived in San Jose, CA in the \u201860\u2019s and people don\u2019t remember how much fruit the valley used to produce before they bulldozed it all and renamed it Silicon Valley!) \n\nSo, I want to start as even though I\u2019m no longer in the church I value being prepared.

My concern is I have been using more syrup than needed because I want to cover the fruit during this step, but then I have waste (or at least jars of syrup in my fridge.)\n\n  \n1. Would it be safe to reuse the syrup, like if I do a batch of one fruit and prepare a batch of the second fruit while the first one is in the canner, could I just keep the leftover syrup and cook the next fruit in it and use it for hot packing? This seems okay, but it is not actually mentioned anywhere I have seen and I want to make sure I am okay.\n\n2. How do you deal with this? Should I just use less syrup, maybe preparing smaller batches as I go? It's a little more difficult in my small space because my canner pretty much takes up the whole stove top and I do my prep in the instant pot on saute in a different area. I guess I should just try using less since as long as it it is already hot when I put the fruit in it seems to look a lot better than the amount of water the fruit is staged in.\n\nSorry these are pretty basic, but this is one area where I don't like trying to dredge info from google, with the quality of the content these days!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1ji3qu0/questions_about_syrup_and_prep_for_hot_packing/", "created_utc": 1742748761.0, "score": 7, "author": "bobertlo", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1ji3qu0/questions_about_syrup_and_prep_for_hot_packing/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Is there any tested canning recipes for dog food?", "selftext": "I read a post here that canning liver was not possible because it's too dense? Is that true, and is it still true if it's finely chopped (perhaps grinded) and added to ground beef as a mix? Offal is very nutrient dense and healthy for us and for dogs.\n\nI have a great dog food recipe and usually portion it out and vacuum seal then freeze them. When it comes to dinner time, it needs to be thawed, and then cooked for our dogs which has to cool before letting them eat. It's a bit of a long process.\n\nSo, I'd like to can the recipe. I've done a batch before and had 6 quarts, pressure canning the raw mix for 90 minutes at the proper pressure for my altitude. The dogs seemed to prefer it even over the freshly cooked batches. I found it interesting that when I would open the jar, it smelled like good, fresh dog food.... but it definitely smelled like dog food.\n\nAs a certified canine nutritionist, I have several recipes that are breed-targeted for my Siberian Huskies living in our climate. I would like to know if there are any recipes already officially tested and approved by National Center for Home Food Preservation or another trusted source. And if not, how would I go about testing my own recipes? Would I just take a batch and let it age, perhaps for a year, and have it tested for botulism, listeria, e-coli, and salmonella?\n\nMost of the canning advice I have read for this sort of specific recipe is to do not add oil, as it will 'coat' the ingredients and potentially protect pathogens from the canning process and don't can eggs as there is no tested recipes for canning eggs. Does that include eggs as an ingredient?\n\nHere's an example of a recipe I commonly use:\n\n>Ingredients  \n\n>5 pounds 90% lean ground beef (do not use fattier meats)\n\n>2 pounds beef heart\n\n>1 pound beef liver\n\n>8 pasture-raised eggs without shells (could be reserved and added at the time of feeding if necessary for canning purposes)\n\n>8 ounces kale\n\n>8 ounces broccoli\n\n>8 ounces dandelion greens\n\n>12 ounces blueberries or mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and cranberries)\n\n>5 tbsp bone meal (seaweed calcium can be used for adult dogs)\n\n>2 tsp wheat germ oil (added at time of feeding)\n\n>2 tsp himalayan salt\n\n>1/4 tsp kelp\n\nThe underlying nutritional breakdown is very specific and well-balanced. I'm not concerned about the recipe, but I'd like to know how to safely make it shelf stable using pressure canning.

So we went to our local supplies shop here in regional Western Australia and they had some Kilner jars (\"original and best\"), so we bought some in each size and got started.  That was the only brand available.\n\nAt some point while canning tomatoes we noticed that the wide mouth 1/2 pint jars and the wide mouth pint jars rings are a slightly different diameter, basically the rings for the smaller jars won't fit on the larger jars.  Annoying and not as advertised, but not the end of the world I suppose.  Canning tomatoes went pretty smoothly, using mostly the larger pint jars.\n\nBut the other day I got access to a cheap 10kg of capsicums and decided to pressure can them.  Apart from a siphoning issue which I'm putting down to user error, after cooling, most of the bands are stuck tight. They can be unscrewed about halfway, but then they start to bind and it takes a lot of force to get them off (these are the bands that came with the jars so not a size mismatch, also they screwed on lovely).  One of the jars seals popped up after finally getting the ring off (I saw someone else complaining about this here too).  I've put all the jars in the fridge with rings for now and we're going to eat them ASAP.  I used the 1/2 pint jars.\n\nI'm wondering what to do going forward.  Ball jars don't seem to be readily available in Australia although not impossible to get, very pricy especially with shipping.  If I got some of those, would the rings fit the Kilner jars?

{"title": "A few canning safety questions", "selftext": "I've canned a few different tomato and tomatillo recipes from the healthy canning website.\n\nOne thing I find a bit tough is how specific (most) recipes are to make a safe product - I love cooking, but I love it for the creativity. I haven't really enjoyed canning - for years I've stuck with lactofermentation for preservation this reason! (I'm not opposed to technical food projects - I brew mead, for example, with a lot of care paid to all technical parameters, but there's still a lot of room for flexibility).\n\nBut of course, canning offers a much wider array of flavour possibilities. So 2 quick questions, after spending too much time wading through lengthy threads and blog posts and not feeling any clearer:\n\n**1) Pressure canning** \n\nam I correct in understanding that, provided I follow proper processes (e.g. those outlined on HealthyCanning), *anything* can be pressure canned? I.e. would this expensive piece of equipment let me be a bit more creative?\n\n**2) pH testing for sauces** \n\nMy understanding is that safe water bath canning requires a pH below 4. However, the reason we can't just make up our own recipes and use test strips is that the centre of *x vegetable* may not be at the required acidity. Folks in the hot sauce community *do* seem to make their own recipes up and essentially can them for shelf stability, after pH testing. Is this considered a safe practice, as we're making the product essentially liquid - i.e. we can reliably test the pH with strips (or a meter)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1j3wlnn/a_few_canning_safety_questions/", "created_utc": 1741154988.0, "score": 1, "author": "oreocereus", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1j3wlnn/a_few_canning_safety_questions/", "html_title": ""}

His mom wants to can tomato sauce. I say ok, let me find a recipe. Also, you're going to need bulk tomatoes and those aren't in season, so it's going to be more expensive. She wants to know why she can't just re-can stuff she's made from metal cans and made into her own sauce. My brain knows, but I'm absolutely terrible about laying out the scientific facts. Help!\n\nAdditional info- my husband had a liver transplant 4 years ago , so we have to be even more hypervigilant about foodborn pathogens. He is also on the spectrum so he really wants the why it isn't safe for anybody, let alone him.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1j30sq5/please_help_me_explain_why_rebel_is_bad/", "created_utc": 1741056612.0, "score": 76, "author": "AprilRosyButt", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1j30sq5/please_help_me_explain_why_rebel_is_bad/", "html_title": ""}

I've never canned anything before and didn't grow up in a family where canning was common (besides my grandma making freezer jam every year), so am a little nervous about wanting to make sure I do everything right so it is safe!\n\nI picked three recipes for my first experiments that I chose because they all use things that are easy to get at the grocery store in these winter months.  I was reading through the recipes today and have a few newbie questions about each that I'm hoping someone can clarify for me.\n\n**Grape Jelly**\n\nI bought the Bernardin Complete Book of Home Preserving and I think the recipe on pg 112 has an error because it says 3oz/177ml of liquid pectin is required. Looking at the other recipes on the page, 177ml should be 6oz of pectin? And [the online version of the recipe ](https://www.bernardin.ca/recipes/en/grape-juice-jelly.htm)looks to be halved and lists 88.5ml of liquid pectin which would actually be 3oz but for half the amount of juice/sugar listed in the recipe book? Just want confirmation that I\u2019m not reading things wrong because it feels bold to look at my first recipe and assume there is an error in the book and not just me misunderstanding something haha\n\n\n\n**Jellied Cranberry Sauce**\n\nPlanning to make the recipe from pg 177 of the Bernardin book. My cranberries are frozen and I see it mentions thawing in the refrigerator first but doesn\u2019t mention if I should include any liquid or not. Some of the recipes for other fruit jams/jellies elsewhere in the book have mentioned saving and including any liquid from the fruit as it thaws in the recipe, would it be safe to assume the same here? ie I should measure out the amount frozen, thaw them in a bowl in the fridge, and then dump the whole thing into my pot to cook down?\n\n\n\n**Applesauce**\n\nPlanning to make the recipe from pg 180 of the Bernardin book.\u00a0\n\n\\- Am I safe to half a recipe if I want to based on the amount of apples I have as long as keep the lemon juice amount proportional?\n\n\\- The bottled lemon juice that I got at the store says it is from concentrate and the ingredients list: water, lemon juice concentrate (sulphites), lemon oil, sodium benzoate, and dimethicone.

I'm talking about faceted shapes, fruit shapes, fun external decor like flowers, fruit, etc.?\n\nAs I've said before I am not opposed to using standard shapes if that is what is most recommended. I also would like to note that I likely would not be practicing canning in such ornate jars, I would use them once I was more confident in my abilities (think of it like an incentive to strive toward!) so as to lower the likelihood of disaster (jars self destructing, etc.)\n\nThank you for any help, pointers, links/urls, etc. Also apologies for my flowery, flamboyant way of typing if it is a bother. When I'm excited about something I tend to get a bit impassioned in my writing.\n\nCheers!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1ikqapb/ornate_jars_that_are_safe/", "created_utc": 1739030013.0, "score": 0, "author": "yamashta", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1ikqapb/ornate_jars_that_are_safe/", "html_title": ""}

Now I have lots of questions.", "selftext": "I asked for a low sugar lemon marmalade recipe last week and you guys really helped me figure out how to make it! I've made two batches so far, and I've completely fallen in love with making my own marmalade. I was terrified of canning anything and now I want to make all kinds of jams. \n\nI borrowed the canning equipment to make the lemon marmalade, but now I want my own. I looked on Amazon but I'm having a hard time choosing a kit. I'm just very overwhelmed and struggling to figure out which kits have a wire rack that will work well with small jars. As of right now, the only thing I see myself making and canning is jams and marmalades in small jars and the recipe book I bought warned that a lot of the racks have wide spacing that doesn't work well with small jars. I also want a kit that has the head measuring tool included and that isn't as commons as I thought it would have been. I also want a pot big enough for 6 small jars. The pot I borrowed could only fit 5 so every batch I made had one jar that was left out. \n\nSince the recipe I used made 6 jars and the pot could only fit 5, I was wondering if anyone had an idea of how long the 6th jar would be good for. I just left it on the counter the entire time, so it never went into the water bath. The lid however did go in the heated water and both times it seems to have sealed as the button on the lid is down. \n\nOn my second batch, when I pulled the jars out of the water bath after putting the lids on, I noticed air bubbles going to the top of the jar on one of the jars I pulled out. It seemed like the jar was pure liquid and that made me super nervous. When I checked it the next day it seemed to be the right texture, though I didn't break the seal on the jar to find out for sure. Is this something I should be concerned about or is it no big deal?\n\nAre the lids reusable? I've heard that they are and that they aren't and I wasn't sure which one to believe.\n\nWhere do you guys store your jams and jellies if you don't have anything remotely like a cellar?

{"title": "Help understanding the science behind why adding extra 'safety features' to a recipe is a no-go... or is it?", "selftext": "I\u2019m a couple of years into pressure canning now and I\u2019m running up against some frustrations that have been brought up by others in post that are archived and/or weren\u2019t really resolved. Hoping some of you can shed some light on the whys.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWorth noting a few things upfront:\n\n1) I\u2019m not looking to cut corners. Food safety is extremely important, as are the official orgs. in charge of it. This isn\u2019t me looking to go rogue and get some crunchy botulism to spite the powers that be.\u00a0\n\n2) I\u2019m not looking for permission to do what I\u2019m proposing. I just want to understand why it\u2019s a bad idea, if in fact it is. No one has told me it's unsafe. I just haven't been able to find any concrete info to understand how or why it would be (aside from it not being a meticulously-followed tested recipe).\n\n3) I don\u2019t care about reducing salt, fat or sugar. Those are excellent food preservation tools, and also very tasty. No shame to anyone who\u2019s doing a low-sodium/fat/sugar diet. There are a million good reasons to go that route, that\u2019s just not what I\u2019m after here. It\u2019s annoying to keep getting stonewalled by explanations that canning recipes don\u2019t need those elements when I\u2019ve been struggling to find answers to more nuanced questions involving keeping them in to improve safety and flavour.\n\n4) I have not done what I\u2019m asking about nor am I encouraging anyone to.\n\n\n\nMy frustrations are rooted in not being able to find scientifically-backed reasoning for why we\u2019re told not to make certain adjustments to recipes, when there\u2019s so much room for variance in a lot of the official recipes out there.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOfficial tested recipes give varying results depending on a whole range of factors like:\n\n\\- Measurements in cups rather than weight.\u00a0\n\n\\- Exact food piece sizes, quality of the ingredient, different cultivars, etc. all impact the density of the food being measured by cup, thereby changing the real amount of the ingredient used.\n\n\\- Syrups in some official fruit preservation recipes being a \u2018choose your own adventure.\u2019 No accounting for density, sugar content, etc. at all when recipes outright say you can swap other syrups in.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI understand that official recipes have margins of error built into them for ingredient variances. That makes sense and I agree that they should do that. But it\u2019s frustrating to mainly find recipes that would require me to totally change how and what I cook in order to can anything other than single, raw ingredients.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s use chicken stock as an example:\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s say I make my own chicken stock my own way, with more salt than a lot of the official recipes call for and without cooling to skim off the fat, but otherwise a similar liquid-only product. I pressure can that DIY stock following all best practices. I leave the same 1\u201d head space that\u2019s given for stock recipes. I use the correct pressure for my elevation, follow all canner instructions perfectly, etc. and can for a length of time beyond what any stock recipes list. Let\u2019s go big and say 120 minutes rather than a more standard \\~25 min just to be safe.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHow is that not safer than the USDA\u2019s or any other official recipe? And if the 120 minutes isn\u2019t long enough, then what\u2019s the longest canning time given for any existing approved recipe? Why would that extreme length of time not be safe for something that\u2019s less dense and saltier than plenty of other foods that can be safely canned? What variables am I not considering that could cause my stock to not reach a high enough temperature for a long enough period of time to be safe?\n\n\n\nDensity - I understand that adjusting recipes can change the density of the product, and that would in turn affect the required canning time to make it safe. But if my changes add in additional layers of safety, in this case salt, fat and a canning time far beyond any stock recipe, what\u2019s the reasoning for this approach being unsafe?\u00a0\n\n\n\nFlat sour - Would the intensive canning time with a higher peak temp not be enough to kill off those \u2018heat-happy\u2019 bacteria too since 250F is enough to take all those species out? And even if I got unlucky and ended up with a batch contaminated with an especially heat-resistant strain, there\u2019s no health risk to the food going off. I\u2019d take a rare bad-tasting batch over not being able to can my own stock ever.\n\n\n\nSiphoning - I\u2019d be fine with some siphoning loss, no more than the \u2018half the liquid\u2019 rule (though does this still matter if there aren\u2019t any solids needing to be submerged anyway?). If this was the only potential issue, experimenting with above-guideline canning times to find a sweet spot that doesn\u2019t result in excessive loss would feel like a win.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAcidity - Would that not be balanced out by salt content and extreme canning time too? Tbh I\u2019d even be open to pH testing my own stock for a few batches and adding some acid (e.g.: tomatoes) if need be, but without any safety baseline for a given recipe, that\u2019s fairly moot. And this is pressure canning so the stocks in the approved recipes have low acidity anyway.\n\n\n\nI understand why public health orgs give blunt, heavy-handed rules that can feel like overkill. If they don\u2019t do that, more people get sick and die. Populations en masse aren\u2019t good with complex, nuanced instructions.\n\n\n\nBut as someone who got into the food preservation game through fermenting, where you learn the rules & science and can then improvise within that framework without issue, the shift to canning has felt impractically restrictive. Like I\u2019m not going to boil a whole chicken and measure out exactly the right amounts of only the ingredients listed in a recipe just to make stock. There\u2019s a stock bag in our freezer with veg & bones collected from making other meals. When it\u2019s full, I make stock that I simmer for at least 6 hours to get the collagen to breakdown. I want to can that!\n\n\n\nOr does this really just boil down to the fact that my stock wouldn\u2019t have been officially tested, and the safety of the adjustments made isn\u2019t something a more seasoned canner would even consider taking into account?\n\n\n\nFor reference, these are some of the earlier threads I\u2019m referring to:\n\n\\- https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/186t8va/frustration\\_with\\_safe\\_canning\\_practices\\_and/\n\n\\- https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1kyp6d/couldnt\\_any\\_recipe\\_or\\_item\\_be\\_canned\\_with\\_a/\n\n\\- https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1hseqgn/do\\_you\\_have\\_to\\_use\\_specific\\_recipes\\_for\\_canning/\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my rant.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1ick6v0/help_understanding_the_science_behind_why_adding/", "created_utc": 1738119941.0, "score": 1, "author": "andanampersandawn", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1ick6v0/help_understanding_the_science_behind_why_adding/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Do you tell someone their canning is unsafe?", "selftext": "So, backstory: I just moved to a rural area to start my homestead dream and posted on a local FB page asking about some local resources. Enter \u201cFarmer Joe\u201d (not his real name.) We chatted a bit and he seemed to have a handle on a bunch of great resources in the area etc. He offered to host me at his \u201cfarm\u201d for a dinner. I agree. Turns out he\u2019s not really a farmer and just a joke because he lives in a historic farmhouse and uses his lot to grow hay. \n\nOkay skipping ahead. The guy is very sweet, kinda struck me as sad, lonely widow. He gave me a gift of a couple of homemade canned soups. I am not a super experienced canner, at most I\u2019ve canned a few tomatoes. But since I\u2019m planning on being a homesteader I read A LOT (and learn a lot about being in this sub)! I asked how he canned them immediately. He essentially just did a water bath. I mentioned that they probably weren\u2019t shelf stable and he INSISTED they were SUPER hot and the jars were sterilized. I ask if there was any acid like lemon or vinegar in the recipes and he said no. They were a red lentil and a carrot, ginger with coconut milk. They weren\u2019t refrigerated or anything (if he made them last week and they stayed in the fridge I would have been more okay with it.) \n\nAt any rate, I accepted and threw them straight in my compost later on. \n\nSo my question is - I don\u2019t want to offend this guy, like I said he\u2019s a sweet, lonely widow in his 60s and he was trying to do something sweet/kind. But should I tell him that I wouldn\u2019t eat them because his canning practices are unsafe?\n\nI don\u2019t get the impression he\u2019s running around giving gifts of canned soups to every one.

Way better than any other pickles I've had, but I'm out of them and have no way of getting more.  I would really like some similar recipes that include pickling spices, garlic, asparagus, dill, etc.  And prefer recipes that don't have added things like zucchini and more spicy peppers.  Doesn't have to be exactly the same.  Or if someone knows a safe recipe and is willing to coach me on if/how to add certain things like dill or pickling spices if it can be done safely.  I'm too new to know what I'm doing, so i have to follow every recipe to a T or get help from safe and experienced canners :)\n\nThank you in advance!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1i64vdp/looking_for_a_recipe_for_these_ingredients_please/", "created_utc": 1737416785.0, "score": 5, "author": "AndroidsHeart", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Canning/comments/1i64vdp/looking_for_a_recipe_for_these_ingredients_please/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "All Jam jars siphoned", "selftext": "We (me and spouse) water bathed some strawberry jam following a tested recipe, 1/4 inch head space, new lids, clean rims, 10 minutes processing time, and almost all the jars siphoned once removed from the water.

I would say we are intermediate level canners, we have water bathed and pressure canned a lot over the past 6 months and this result was just unexpected. One recipe called for 1/8 inch head space, which is almost touching the lid. It's winter so the kitchen was maybe cooler than in the summer, but with the canner going it was warm in there.

{"title": "Should I buy a freezer or a pressure canner?", "selftext": "I want to start drinking homemade bone broth every day, but to do that, I need somewhere to store it all. I don't have enough freezer space currently. So this is the motivating factor behind wanting to buy a small freezer or a pressure canner now, but I'm considering the other uses for each one and can't decide which one would be better. Factors I'm considering for each, in no particular order:\n\nPressure canner\n- No storage space limitations (besides that of my house) (My dad and I are planning a joint garden for this year, so I might need that extra space.)\n- Longer shelf life\n- Shelf stable\n- Appliance itself takes up very little space\n- More limited on what can be preserved (approved recipes only)\n- More expensive (digital canner - already researched this a lot and made my decision so not looking for feedback here)\n- Faster access to foods (no thaw time)\n\nFreezer (probably just 3.5 cubic feet)\n- Can only store as much as it holds (but it's only stuff for me, not for a family)\n- Preserves flavor and nutrients better\n- Can preserve pretty much anything\n- Takes up more space and electricity (though not much electricity)\n- Less expensive\n- Low concern for power outages in my area\n\nI think I'm forgetting something... oh well. \n\nSo, what do you think?

{"title": "Siphoning? ", "selftext": "*on mobile so formatting will probably disappear when I hit post, sorry. Baby canner here but getting more confident each time. \n\nI'm confident in my preparation and technique in canning broth. I followed approved recipe from ball and my presto canner instruction manual for backup on time and pressure. It's simple chicken broth from carcass. \nMy question is, is this siphoning? \nI filled each jar and left the required 1 inch head space. The rings were finger tight going in but loose coming out of the canner. That also confused me. Also will the one will more than an inch of head space after canning still be good or do I need to use it asap?
