I drove myself to the hospital (seriously, don\u2019t be embarrassed to call emergency services! I was and it could have led to an even worse fate) and found out my heart was in a life threatening Atrial Fibrillation condition.\n\nTwo liters of fluid and two rounds of IV meds to slow my heart down later and I am being told my only option is to have a Cardioversion. The plan was to dose me out of my gourd with Ketamine, connect me to an AED and shock my ticker back to sinus rhythm.\n\nFriends, in all of my 41 years on this dirt ball I have never been more scared. \n\nLess than a week ago I was celebrating turning 41 and now I might not see 42.\n\nThe ketamine was pushed, I got a weird fuzzy sensation as my perception spiraled out and away and I woke up to\u2026 Nothing. My heart was no longer racing, my blood pressure was back to normal and I was in perfect sinus rhythm. A single 100 joule shock reset my heart from a Tool Polyrhythm back to proper 3/4 time. And all it took was a trip down a K-Hole and a quick visit to the Crystal Dimension. \n\nI am doing fine now, but I have to keep an eye on things a lot closer now. Every time my heart flutters I fear, \u201cAm I going to have to call 911 and go visit The Crystal Dimension again?\u201d I have a cardiologist lined up and I am continuing my journey to health by way of eating better and getting sober.\n\nThis weeks box looks so, so good. It was my first attempt at tamagoyaki and I added in two of my favorites, Lace Gyoza and lychee fruit.

So I made poor man's *(quality wise)* onigiri instead.\n* **The second item is grilled asparagus with miso:**\n   * I didn't have aluminium foil for the asparagus so I fried it instead.\n   * The miso I had was very thick and it felt less like *\"asparagus with miso\"* and more like Miso-paragus.\n* **The third item is tamagoyaki:**\n   * The recipe asked for mayo but it didn't really *dissolve* and just became a lumpy ~~^(space princess)~~ mess. Tried to fry it still, but...\n   * I don't have a dedicated pan for those (yet) so I tried following a recipe I found online for doing it in a regular pan. And. It. Kept. Sticking. To. The. Friggin. PAN. I have two theories here - either the pan has already lost some of its non-stickness or the heat was still too high.\n* You can see how unskilled I am with shaping rice.\n* Blueberries because THAT is I dish I can't mess up. AND I DIDN'T, SUCCESS!\n\nI made one for my wife and one for my kid. Wife said she loved it all (except more mirin in the rice next time), the kid kinda didn't like it which is fine, it didn't come out great anyway.\n\nThere are far more lessons here than I can learn in a single sitting so I'll just hopefully continue to chug along making bad bentos until I achieve the breathtaking level of a Maybe Passable Bento Master.

{"title": "YAY I GET TO BENTO AGAIN -wait, I need to get food for it, eek", "selftext": "So after a few months, I FINALLY have a job again! I start in a week.  And that means I need to start being able to make bentos again.\n\nI am planning on a bit of a food prep/cooking session this weekend and the day before the job starts so I can throw things together each morning.  Looking for ideas about what I can make, some stash ideas to keep on hand, and some general recommendations for how to get over the 7:30 am \"I'm only half awake and I don't know what to pack\" hurdle.\n\nI do have some ideas so far, at least for the first week; I also have some personal quirks (some good, some bad).\n\n\\* I live in NYC so I have access to a whole lot of food shops.  I'm already planning a trip to a couple of my favorite Asian grocery stores and a Daiso in Brooklyn.\n\n\\* I'm also already planning to make some mini-meatballs and soboro mixes for the fridge and freezer, so they are on hand.  I'm also planning to pick up some pre-made things; Trader Joe's has some decent-enough gyoza and some chicken/pineapple meatballs.  My local grocery store also has a whole lot of different 1.5 ounce tuna pouches that I'll stock up on for quick tuna-on-rice bentos and soboros.  I'm also planning on \"finger food\" things like grapes, carrot sticks, trail mix, making a batch of small cookies, etc.  (I also already have a whole package of individually wrapped cookies that I'll be dipping into.)\n\n\\* I would GREATLY, GREATLY prefer not to be cooking in the morning. Anything I can make the night before and just heat up or throw into the bento as-is would work best.  (Tips for how to freeze and then defrost tamagoyaki and rice would be FANTASTIC.)\n\n\\* I would also like to avoid using a microwave in the morning if possible; my roommate has a later work start time and noise carries in this apartment like crazy.  I DO have a rice cooker with a steamer basket, so if there's a way to reheat anything by steaming that'd be fantastic (I can handle using a rice cooker in the morning).  He's said that occasional microwaving is dealable, however; but I'd like to avoid it.\n\n\\* I have a somewhat adventurous palate, so nothing's off the table in terms of taste, cuisine, or appetite.  \n\n\\* I have a tamagakyoki pan and (as mentioned above) a rice cooker with a steamer basket.  I'm also pretty comfortable in a kitchen in general so complicated projects are just fine.  I also have both of Makiko Itoh's \"Just Bento\" cookbooks.\n\n\\* I have a METRIC ASSLOAD of different dried beans and already will be making some kind of bean salads as part of the stash.  \n\n\\* This would be for a middle-aged adult woman with no allergies; however, a few vegetables give me really bad indigestion (broccoli, cauliflower, turnips, savoy cabbage and brussels sprouts) so I avoid them.  (Weirdly, napa cabbage is okay, so kimchi is still an option - fortunately so since I do like it).\n\n\\* I have a small collection of two-tier bento boxes, some silicone liners and a \"Laptop Lunch\" box with 4 different sized containers for food (I opt for that when I'm REALLY brain-dead in the morning and don't want to do math; then it's just \"fill box A with stuff, Box b with different stuff, blerg\").\n\nRight!

So I made poor man's *(quality wise)* onigiri instead.\n* **The second item is grilled asparagus with miso:**\n   * I didn't have aluminium foil for the asparagus so I fried it instead.\n   * The miso I had was very thick and it felt less like *\"asparagus with miso\"* and more like Miso-paragus.\n* **The third item is tamagoyaki:**\n   * The recipe asked for mayo but it didn't really *dissolve* and just became a lumpy ~~^(space princess)~~ mess. Tried to fry it still, but...\n   * I don't have a dedicated pan for those (yet) so I tried following a recipe I found online for doing it in a regular pan. And. It. Kept. Sticking. To. The. Friggin.

{"title": "His & Hers ploughman's bentos", "selftext": "A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/f2bdlb/what_would_you_put_in_a_ploughmans_lunch/) on r/AskUK inspired me to create a ploughman's lunch bento for today's outing. The boxes contain a variety of cut veggies with homemade dill dip, grapes (more finger-foody and travels better than sliced apples), leftover chuck roast, Branston's pickle, hard boiled eggs, sliced cheeses (pepper jack and two types of cheddar), homemade pickles from this year's garden (left are my bread and butter, right are his grandma's dill pickle recipe), and a couple wheat rolls I had on hand. Everything here is pretty much standard foods/ingredients we have around the house, except the Branston pickle I bought specifically because of earlier post. I'm too lazy to make scotch eggs, but I might have to try making pork pies in the future for this style lunch.    \n\n[Lunch boxes filled with roast beef, cheeses, hard boild eggs, pickles, veggies, grapes, dip, relish, and bread](https://preview.redd.it/1svd31tha95e1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec49241a8c0c2109e9277edcb08e84486e5e23b)\n\nMy first post here, though I've been doing bento-style meals and meal prep for over a couple decades, so I'll give you a little introduction: We also do a \"charcuterie\" thing (bento or just on plates for a meal). The difference from the ploughman's lunch is crackers instead of bread, high quality sliced lunchmeat rolled and cut into cracker sized chunks, and usually a couple condiments (dijon or stone ground, fig jam, pepper relish). Another bento type meal we do is what we call \"picnic dinner\" which merges our tea time fruit and chai with more savory dishes to make a meal, featuring dishes like chilled grilled salmon or chicken; chicken pasta salad; grilled salmon mixed into a spreadable cheese; caprese avocado salad; soft and hard cheeses;, a variety of fresh fruits (berries, mangos, pineapple, etc.); any number of breads or crackers (mini flat breads, bagel chips, specialty or club crackers, or even sliced baguette); and a thermos of chai (with containers of cream and sugar to finish our mugs).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1h860vb/his_hers_ploughmans_bentos/", "created_utc": 1733504427.0, "score": 26, "author": "deborah_az", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1h860vb/his_hers_ploughmans_bentos/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Tips and hacks for meal prepping your bentos?", "selftext": "I try to cut time in the (very) early mornings by prepping things in advance and storing servings in the fridge or freezer so I can just quickly assemble my lunch, but it's been a bit of trial and error learning what stores and reheats well. I'd love to know if anyone else has any trips they can share. Here are some of mine:\n\n* Rice freezes well; store in an air-tight container or cling foil and reheat in the microwave. \n* Tamagoyaki, stir fried or braised veggies, and blanched veggies freeze well, can be packed frozen and will thaw out in your bento by lunchtime. Only issue is they're less malleable in the box when you pack it. \n* Inarizushi (tofu sushi) freezes well; plastic wrapping them individually stops them from drying out. Reheat in the microwave. \n* Carrot kinpira is simple to make and stores well in the fridge for a few days. Don't keep for more than 3-4 days, after which it starts to ferment. \n* Beef is generally great -- reheats without issue out of the fridge or freezer. Gyudon in particular is a favourite. Chicken I prefer to freeze rather than store in the fridge. \n* Meats coated in cornstarch have a funny texture when reheated; if I plan to store in the fridge/freezer, I prefer to skip it. \n* Meat balls are also nifty, can be kept in the fridge or freezer, and reheat well. Easy to pack. \n\nOf course most things would be tastiest made fresh that morning, and I'd love to have some tricks up my sleeve to expedite any cooking where I can. I'd love to know what tricks you guys have picked up along the way.

In the video MonBento has for it, they say 500 Watt max, my work has a 1000 watt unadjustable microwave, (doesn't have a turn table, uses a knob to set the time, can't change power level), would it still be safe to use in it if I only do half the max time?\n\nThank you for your time, I tried to find the answers for the last 30 minutes, but my lunch is ending and I don't have much time left.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1h05d7z/i_have_some_questions_about_the_monbento_square/", "created_utc": 1732602064.0, "score": 2, "author": "lancekehisato", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1h05d7z/i_have_some_questions_about_the_monbento_square/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Monbento is overpriced garbage that is made of cheap plastic and warps after a few uses. I don't understand the hype.", "selftext": "I'm incredibly disappointed with my Monbento boxes that the internet has hyped up to be \"the best bento boxes.\"\n\nI ordered two bento boxes for myself and my partner. Straight away, I noticed that they were made of cheap plastic, and the internal airtight lids on my partner's bento box did not fit. We tried for a long time to put them on. First, gently and carefully. Then, forcefully and exasperatedly. But the rubber seals around the edges were ripped up by the time we actually got the lids on properly. Before you ask, yes we did read the instructions and watched the videos. Yes, we were putting them on as they are supposed to be.\n\nBut hey, maybe they'll get easier to use the more we use them. Break them in, you know.\n\nI put my partner's bento in the dishwasher (Monbento says they're supposed to be dishwasher safe). Well, they came out and the lids no longer fit at all. They had been warped in the dishwasher, even though they're marketed as being dishwasher safe.\n\nBut hey, maybe my dishwasher just uses hotter water than other standard dishwashers.\n\nI contacted the company and they sent me replacement lids for free. Their customer service does respond fast and they're very nice, and shipped the replacement parts immediately. I no longer put them in the dishwasher and I just hand-wash them.\n\nThe lids can now go on the boxes, but it takes a crazy amount of effort to get them on right (and especially when you're trying to not rip the rubber on them).\n\nThe tabs that you're supposed to pull on to remove the lids are a complete joke. They're completely useless. They do not work at all and I do not understand how this passed QA.\n\nThe plastic stains very, very easily. My bento box permanently has brown and orange spots in it.\n\nAnd tonight, while about to prepare lunch for tomorrow, my bento box, that I've never put in the dishwasher), I found that I could not get the lids back on. At all. Even with the rubber seals ripping. This time, it wasn't the lids that were warped... it was the boxes themselves. Again, these ones have never been in the dishwasher, yet the sides curved inwards. I have no idea how this happened, because honestly I've barely used mine since buying it. The $40 bento box is now completely useless.\n\nBefore you say that any of this was user error, it's not. I followed the instructions that come with the box itself as well as the instructions and guidelines on the website and the videos too. They are supposed to be microwave safe and dishwasher safe. The lids aren't supposed to take several minutes of trying to get them on and a LOT of force to get them off. The rubber is not supposed to rip in the first use. And these were not knock-offs -- I bought directly from their website to specifically avoid any possibility of getting a knockoff (like Amazon does sometimes).\n\nAll of that, plus the outer lid on top doesn't actually attach to any of it, and the boxes don't attach to each other (if you get a box with two compartments) and have to be held in place with the band. That's known before you buy them, so I can't really complain about that, but it is an extra annoyance if you're considering buying one.\n\nI just do not understand why people rave about Monbento being one of the best bento boxes there is when I can find store brand leftover containers that are sturdier, easier to use, easier to carry, don't stain, and are dishwasher safe for less than a quarter of the price of a Monbento. I really tried to give these boxes the benefit of the doubt so many times, because surely there is a reason why people love these boxes. But I truly have no idea why.\n\nIf you're looking at buying a Monbento, DON'T. There are so many other brands out there that are so much more budget friendly, are all around better quality, and aren't extremely frustrating to use. I also know that seeing something made right in France and not a Chinese factory is alluring, but I promise, it's not worth it. I wonder if a lot of these positive reviews I see on Reddit for Monbento are just astroturfing.\n\nI want my $80+ dollars back.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1gol4v6/monbento_is_overpriced_garbage_that_is_made_of/", "created_utc": 1731303583.0, "score": 48, "author": "DaydreamerJane", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1gol4v6/monbento_is_overpriced_garbage_that_is_made_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "YAY I GET TO BENTO AGAIN -wait, I need to get food for it, eek", "selftext": "So after a few months, I FINALLY have a job again! I start in a week.  And that means I need to start being able to make bentos again.\n\nI am planning on a bit of a food prep/cooking session this weekend and the day before the job starts so I can throw things together each morning.  Looking for ideas about what I can make, some stash ideas to keep on hand, and some general recommendations for how to get over the 7:30 am \"I'm only half awake and I don't know what to pack\" hurdle.\n\nI do have some ideas so far, at least for the first week; I also have some personal quirks (some good, some bad).\n\n\\* I live in NYC so I have access to a whole lot of food shops.  I'm already planning a trip to a couple of my favorite Asian grocery stores and a Daiso in Brooklyn.\n\n\\* I'm also already planning to make some mini-meatballs and soboro mixes for the fridge and freezer, so they are on hand.  I'm also planning to pick up some pre-made things; Trader Joe's has some decent-enough gyoza and some chicken/pineapple meatballs.  My local grocery store also has a whole lot of different 1.5 ounce tuna pouches that I'll stock up on for quick tuna-on-rice bentos and soboros.  I'm also planning on \"finger food\" things like grapes, carrot sticks, trail mix, making a batch of small cookies, etc.  (I also already have a whole package of individually wrapped cookies that I'll be dipping into.)\n\n\\* I would GREATLY, GREATLY prefer not to be cooking in the morning. Anything I can make the night before and just heat up or throw into the bento as-is would work best.  (Tips for how to freeze and then defrost tamagoyaki and rice would be FANTASTIC.)\n\n\\* I would also like to avoid using a microwave in the morning if possible; my roommate has a later work start time and noise carries in this apartment like crazy.  I DO have a rice cooker with a steamer basket, so if there's a way to reheat anything by steaming that'd be fantastic (I can handle using a rice cooker in the morning).  He's said that occasional microwaving is dealable, however; but I'd like to avoid it.\n\n\\* I have a somewhat adventurous palate, so nothing's off the table in terms of taste, cuisine, or appetite.  \n\n\\* I have a tamagakyoki pan and (as mentioned above) a rice cooker with a steamer basket.  I'm also pretty comfortable in a kitchen in general so complicated projects are just fine.  I also have both of Makiko Itoh's \"Just Bento\" cookbooks.\n\n\\* I have a METRIC ASSLOAD of different dried beans and already will be making some kind of bean salads as part of the stash.  \n\n\\* This would be for a middle-aged adult woman with no allergies; however, a few vegetables give me really bad indigestion (broccoli, cauliflower, turnips, savoy cabbage and brussels sprouts) so I avoid them.  (Weirdly, napa cabbage is okay, so kimchi is still an option - fortunately so since I do like it).\n\n\\* I have a small collection of two-tier bento boxes, some silicone liners and a \"Laptop Lunch\" box with 4 different sized containers for food (I opt for that when I'm REALLY brain-dead in the morning and don't want to do math; then it's just \"fill box A with stuff, Box b with different stuff, blerg\").\n\nRight!

I attempted the first recipe from **Real Bento** by *Inoue Kanae* and it turned into a rollercoaster of failures:\n\n* **The first item in the recipe is chicken with potatoes:**\n   * I didn't have potatoes for the chicken recipe because my kid took so long to go to bed that I forgot I had to go shopping for the potatoes. So I made poor man's *(quality wise)* onigiri instead.\n* **The second item is grilled asparagus with miso:**\n   * I didn't have aluminium foil for the asparagus so I fried it instead.\n   * The miso I had was very thick and it felt less like *\"asparagus with miso\"* and more like Miso-paragus.\n* **The third item is tamagoyaki:**\n   * The recipe asked for mayo but it didn't really *dissolve* and just became a lumpy ~~^(space princess)~~ mess. Tried to fry it still, but...\n   * I don't have a dedicated pan for those (yet) so I tried following a recipe I found online for doing it in a regular pan. And. It. Kept. Sticking. To. The. Friggin. PAN. I have two theories here - either the pan has already lost some of its non-stickness or the heat was still too high.\n* You can see how unskilled I am with shaping rice.\n* Blueberries because THAT is I dish I can't mess up. AND I DIDN'T, SUCCESS!\n\nI made one for my wife and one for my kid. Wife said she loved it all (except more mirin in the rice next time), the kid kinda didn't like it which is fine, it didn't come out great anyway.\n\nThere are far more lessons here than I can learn in a single sitting so I'll just hopefully continue to chug along making bad bentos until I achieve the breathtaking level of a Maybe Passable Bento Master.

And all it took was a trip down a K-Hole and a quick visit to the Crystal Dimension. \n\nI am doing fine now, but I have to keep an eye on things a lot closer now. Every time my heart flutters I fear, \u201cAm I going to have to call 911 and go visit The Crystal Dimension again?\u201d I have a cardiologist lined up and I am continuing my journey to health by way of eating better and getting sober.\n\nThis weeks box looks so, so good. It was my first attempt at tamagoyaki and I added in two of my favorites, Lace Gyoza and lychee fruit. We celebrated my birthday going to a Kura Sushi location right next to an H-Mart, so I stocked up on so many good bento ingredients.\n\nI am looking forward to showing y\u2019all what I come up with every week and I am really happy to still be here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iawwjf", "created_utc": 1737943261.0, "score": 372, "author": "Gul_Ducatti", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1iawwjf/i_guess_this_is_my_weekly_thing_now_also_i_almost/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Tips and hacks for meal prepping your bentos?", "selftext": "I try to cut time in the (very) early mornings by prepping things in advance and storing servings in the fridge or freezer so I can just quickly assemble my lunch, but it's been a bit of trial and error learning what stores and reheats well. I'd love to know if anyone else has any trips they can share. Here are some of mine:\n\n* Rice freezes well; store in an air-tight container or cling foil and reheat in the microwave. \n* Tamagoyaki, stir fried or braised veggies, and blanched veggies freeze well, can be packed frozen and will thaw out in your bento by lunchtime. Only issue is they're less malleable in the box when you pack it. \n* Inarizushi (tofu sushi) freezes well; plastic wrapping them individually stops them from drying out. Reheat in the microwave. \n* Carrot kinpira is simple to make and stores well in the fridge for a few days. Don't keep for more than 3-4 days, after which it starts to ferment. \n* Beef is generally great -- reheats without issue out of the fridge or freezer. Gyudon in particular is a favourite. Chicken I prefer to freeze rather than store in the fridge. \n* Meats coated in cornstarch have a funny texture when reheated; if I plan to store in the fridge/freezer, I prefer to skip it. \n* Meat balls are also nifty, can be kept in the fridge or freezer, and reheat well. Easy to pack. \n\nOf course most things would be tastiest made fresh that morning, and I'd love to have some tricks up my sleeve to expedite any cooking where I can. I'd love to know what tricks you guys have picked up along the way.

{"title": "His & Hers ploughman's bentos", "selftext": "A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/f2bdlb/what_would_you_put_in_a_ploughmans_lunch/) on r/AskUK inspired me to create a ploughman's lunch bento for today's outing. The boxes contain a variety of cut veggies with homemade dill dip, grapes (more finger-foody and travels better than sliced apples), leftover chuck roast, Branston's pickle, hard boiled eggs, sliced cheeses (pepper jack and two types of cheddar), homemade pickles from this year's garden (left are my bread and butter, right are his grandma's dill pickle recipe), and a couple wheat rolls I had on hand. Everything here is pretty much standard foods/ingredients we have around the house, except the Branston pickle I bought specifically because of earlier post. I'm too lazy to make scotch eggs, but I might have to try making pork pies in the future for this style lunch.    \n\n[Lunch boxes filled with roast beef, cheeses, hard boild eggs, pickles, veggies, grapes, dip, relish, and bread](https://preview.redd.it/1svd31tha95e1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec49241a8c0c2109e9277edcb08e84486e5e23b)\n\nMy first post here, though I've been doing bento-style meals and meal prep for over a couple decades, so I'll give you a little introduction: We also do a \"charcuterie\" thing (bento or just on plates for a meal). The difference from the ploughman's lunch is crackers instead of bread, high quality sliced lunchmeat rolled and cut into cracker sized chunks, and usually a couple condiments (dijon or stone ground, fig jam, pepper relish). Another bento type meal we do is what we call \"picnic dinner\" which merges our tea time fruit and chai with more savory dishes to make a meal, featuring dishes like chilled grilled salmon or chicken; chicken pasta salad; grilled salmon mixed into a spreadable cheese; caprese avocado salad; soft and hard cheeses;, a variety of fresh fruits (berries, mangos, pineapple, etc.); any number of breads or crackers (mini flat breads, bagel chips, specialty or club crackers, or even sliced baguette); and a thermos of chai (with containers of cream and sugar to finish our mugs).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1h860vb/his_hers_ploughmans_bentos/", "created_utc": 1733504427.0, "score": 27, "author": "deborah_az", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1h860vb/his_hers_ploughmans_bentos/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

As far as meat goes I\u2019ve only been getting cold meat as **I don\u2019t have anything to cook with, including any hotplates** (I ordered an air fryer yesterday). I don\u2019t have much variety in my fridge.\nI\u2019ve been running out of brain power to come up with simple filling food items that are no-cook. I dislike most vegetables so that makes it hard too.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear anyone\u2019s feedback, if you have any ideas for inspiration, especially anything with extended shelf/fridge life\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1h6a5yc/struggling_looking_for_guidance/", "created_utc": 1733295396.0, "score": 5, "author": "artsygrl2021", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1h6a5yc/struggling_looking_for_guidance/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I have an old cooler I have been using as my lunch box, and I don't know the dimensions of the inside.(Don't have a tape measure to check right now) What are the dimensions of the MB Square, or should I get the bag they sell? (I need to keep it cold somehow I don't have access to a fridge)\n2. Is the cutlery worth getting? I can easily take my own cutlery with me if the add-on set isn't worth the hassle.\n3. In the video MonBento has for it, they say 500 Watt max, my work has a 1000 watt unadjustable microwave, (doesn't have a turn table, uses a knob to set the time, can't change power level), would it still be safe to use in it if I only do half the max time?\n\nThank you for your time, I tried to find the answers for the last 30 minutes, but my lunch is ending and I don't have much time left.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1h05d7z/i_have_some_questions_about_the_monbento_square/", "created_utc": 1732602064.0, "score": 3, "author": "lancekehisato", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1h05d7z/i_have_some_questions_about_the_monbento_square/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Monbento is overpriced garbage that is made of cheap plastic and warps after a few uses. I don't understand the hype.", "selftext": "I'm incredibly disappointed with my Monbento boxes that the internet has hyped up to be \"the best bento boxes.\"\n\nI ordered two bento boxes for myself and my partner. Straight away, I noticed that they were made of cheap plastic, and the internal airtight lids on my partner's bento box did not fit. We tried for a long time to put them on. First, gently and carefully. Then, forcefully and exasperatedly. But the rubber seals around the edges were ripped up by the time we actually got the lids on properly. Before you ask, yes we did read the instructions and watched the videos. Yes, we were putting them on as they are supposed to be.\n\nBut hey, maybe they'll get easier to use the more we use them. Break them in, you know.\n\nI put my partner's bento in the dishwasher (Monbento says they're supposed to be dishwasher safe). Well, they came out and the lids no longer fit at all. They had been warped in the dishwasher, even though they're marketed as being dishwasher safe.\n\nBut hey, maybe my dishwasher just uses hotter water than other standard dishwashers.\n\nI contacted the company and they sent me replacement lids for free. Their customer service does respond fast and they're very nice, and shipped the replacement parts immediately. I no longer put them in the dishwasher and I just hand-wash them.\n\nThe lids can now go on the boxes, but it takes a crazy amount of effort to get them on right (and especially when you're trying to not rip the rubber on them).\n\nThe tabs that you're supposed to pull on to remove the lids are a complete joke. They're completely useless. They do not work at all and I do not understand how this passed QA.\n\nThe plastic stains very, very easily. My bento box permanently has brown and orange spots in it.\n\nAnd tonight, while about to prepare lunch for tomorrow, my bento box, that I've never put in the dishwasher), I found that I could not get the lids back on. At all. Even with the rubber seals ripping. This time, it wasn't the lids that were warped... it was the boxes themselves. Again, these ones have never been in the dishwasher, yet the sides curved inwards. I have no idea how this happened, because honestly I've barely used mine since buying it. The $40 bento box is now completely useless.\n\nBefore you say that any of this was user error, it's not. I followed the instructions that come with the box itself as well as the instructions and guidelines on the website and the videos too. They are supposed to be microwave safe and dishwasher safe. The lids aren't supposed to take several minutes of trying to get them on and a LOT of force to get them off. The rubber is not supposed to rip in the first use. And these were not knock-offs -- I bought directly from their website to specifically avoid any possibility of getting a knockoff (like Amazon does sometimes).\n\nAll of that, plus the outer lid on top doesn't actually attach to any of it, and the boxes don't attach to each other (if you get a box with two compartments) and have to be held in place with the band. That's known before you buy them, so I can't really complain about that, but it is an extra annoyance if you're considering buying one.\n\nI just do not understand why people rave about Monbento being one of the best bento boxes there is when I can find store brand leftover containers that are sturdier, easier to use, easier to carry, don't stain, and are dishwasher safe for less than a quarter of the price of a Monbento. I really tried to give these boxes the benefit of the doubt so many times, because surely there is a reason why people love these boxes. But I truly have no idea why.\n\nIf you're looking at buying a Monbento, DON'T. There are so many other brands out there that are so much more budget friendly, are all around better quality, and aren't extremely frustrating to use. I also know that seeing something made right in France and not a Chinese factory is alluring, but I promise, it's not worth it. I wonder if a lot of these positive reviews I see on Reddit for Monbento are just astroturfing.\n\nI want my $80+ dollars back.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1gol4v6/monbento_is_overpriced_garbage_that_is_made_of/", "created_utc": 1731303583.0, "score": 47, "author": "DaydreamerJane", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1gol4v6/monbento_is_overpriced_garbage_that_is_made_of/", "html_title": ""}
