{"title": "My first bento in all its (severely lacking) glory!", "selftext": "This is my first ever attempt at making Bento.

So I made poor man's *(quality wise)* onigiri instead.\n* **The second item is grilled asparagus with miso:**\n   * I didn't have aluminium foil for the asparagus so I fried it instead.\n   * The miso I had was very thick and it felt less like *\"asparagus with miso\"* and more like Miso-paragus.\n* **The third item is tamagoyaki:**\n   * The recipe asked for mayo but it didn't really *dissolve* and just became a lumpy ~~^(space princess)~~ mess. Tried to fry it still, but...\n   * I don't have a dedicated pan for those (yet) so I tried following a recipe I found online for doing it in a regular pan. And. It. Kept. Sticking. To. The. Friggin. PAN. I have two theories here - either the pan has already lost some of its non-stickness or the heat was still too high.\n* You can see how unskilled I am with shaping rice.\n* Blueberries because THAT is I dish I can't mess up. AND I DIDN'T, SUCCESS!\n\nI made one for my wife and one for my kid. Wife said she loved it all (except more mirin in the rice next time), the kid kinda didn't like it which is fine, it didn't come out great anyway.\n\nThere are far more lessons here than I can learn in a single sitting so I'll just hopefully continue to chug along making bad bentos until I achieve the breathtaking level of a Maybe Passable Bento Master.

In Japanese markets, I discovered frozen portioned entrees and sides for busy people making bentos. Maybe you have an international market with these items or even prep small portions and freeze them, but more importantly it shows you can use whatever you like and it doesn't need to be long cooking hours in the kitchen.\n\nAlso use simple fruits, vegetables and simple proteins like boiled eggs or sausages. These are in traditional bentos as well.", "For my lunches I really try to keep it simple. I meal prep on Sunday by cooking enough rice and meat for 5 servings. I then use canned, fresh or frozen veggies to add to it. So I'll cook a pound of ground beef, 4 cups of sushi rice, and steam 2 bags of frozen broccoli. I set out 5 of those black meal prep containers you can get in bulk just about anywhere. Divide up the food, let it cool, then put it in the fridge. By keeping the main ingredients simple, I can then start adding fun stuff like those baby wheels of cheese, or cheese cubes, cherry tomatoes, different berries, nuts, etc. Once you get the basics down it's easy to start customizing them. Ill do different meats, different kinds of rice or other grains, or switch to a handful of lettuce when I want to eat lighter (usually when it's hot I don't eat as much rice). The key for me is being prepared. I have to put a little effort into my grocery list and think about what I want or I will feel too overwhelmed.\nMy bento are not even close to picture worthy. I use this sub as inspiration. I still haven't gotten the little silicone cups to seperate my items. I actually dont even have a real bento container anymore. I often want to heat some of my food and not the little snacks, so I will just put my cheese cubes/nuts/fruit in an entirely seperate container or plastic bags. Im just proud im not eating a sandwich and chips everyday anymore.", "I plan my dinner menu around bento, and then cook enough food for dinner plus bento for 2 people.  I don't do any cooking in the morning, just pack the leftovers into boxes and then add fresh elements like salad, fruit, and space fillers.\n\nI do cook every night, but that's because I like having something different every day for lunch.  If you were looking to do meal prep, you could reduce the cooking to 1-2 days a week and just use the same dishes for multiple days.", "Get a rice cooker with a steamer basket and a delay timer. Buy a bag of bibigo dumplings of your choice. Buy some bags of frozen vegetables that you can cook in some easy way that you\u2019re cool with, whether microwaving, boiling, or roasting. Buy some pre-cut fruit. \n\nFill your rice cooker with rice and water before going to bed. I use veggie dumplings so I just put them in there too and use the delay timer so it\u2019s ready when I get up but if using meat ones, like I do for my husband\u2019s bento sometimes, I go to the kitchen right when I wake up, grab the bag of frozen dumplings, throw them in the steamer basket and then set it going. It\u2019s ready in around forty minutes. Cook the veggies at the same time or the night before, whatever you prefer. \n\nYour main section of your bento box will have rice with furikake or salt and then dumplings, and your side dish sections will have fruit and veggies.\n\nDumplings are just one example of very easy main courses. Rotisserie chicken, canned sardines, canned tuna, frozen murikake or edamame, canned salmon, or hard boiled eggs can be substituted, and other similar things. Sometimes i\u2019ll throw some jumbo frozen shrimp in the steamer basket instead of dumplings. \n\nFor my husband I often will buy premade potato salad with eggs from Fry\u2019s and use that for a side instead of vegetables. You could also use any other deli ready-made item, like pasta salad or taboulli or whatever. \n\nAll of these take very little time to put together :)", "Bentos are fun, and in the end it's about YOIR lunch, so pack what you like, and what you have already.  I love frozen food for bentos, frozen veg is your friend, and often more complicated foods, lke dumplings, you can buy frozen and just grab how ever many you  want.  You can preportion rice and freeze it, then just nuke in in the morning.  Breakfast for lunch can be fun, toast up some Eggo's and sausages and away you go.  Collect up free condiments from fast food and stores, individual sauces, etc can come in handy.\n\nThe best part is you only need a small amount of each thing.  Two tablespoons of coleslaw (can be store bought) is enough to fill a spot.  If you don't want to do anything in the morning, pack it the night before and put  the whole thing in the fridge. Don't get stressed, it's really just lunch, good luck!"]}

And that means I need to start being able to make bentos again.\n\nI am planning on a bit of a food prep/cooking session this weekend and the day before the job starts so I can throw things together each morning.  Looking for ideas about what I can make, some stash ideas to keep on hand, and some general recommendations for how to get over the 7:30 am \"I'm only half awake and I don't know what to pack\" hurdle.\n\nI do have some ideas so far, at least for the first week; I also have some personal quirks (some good, some bad).\n\n\\* I live in NYC so I have access to a whole lot of food shops.  I'm already planning a trip to a couple of my favorite Asian grocery stores and a Daiso in Brooklyn.\n\n\\* I'm also already planning to make some mini-meatballs and soboro mixes for the fridge and freezer, so they are on hand.  I'm also planning to pick up some pre-made things; Trader Joe's has some decent-enough gyoza and some chicken/pineapple meatballs.  My local grocery store also has a whole lot of different 1.5 ounce tuna pouches that I'll stock up on for quick tuna-on-rice bentos and soboros.  I'm also planning on \"finger food\" things like grapes, carrot sticks, trail mix, making a batch of small cookies, etc.  (I also already have a whole package of individually wrapped cookies that I'll be dipping into.)\n\n\\* I would GREATLY, GREATLY prefer not to be cooking in the morning. Anything I can make the night before and just heat up or throw into the bento as-is would work best.  (Tips for how to freeze and then defrost tamagoyaki and rice would be FANTASTIC.)\n\n\\* I would also like to avoid using a microwave in the morning if possible; my roommate has a later work start time and noise carries in this apartment like crazy.  I DO have a rice cooker with a steamer basket, so if there's a way to reheat anything by steaming that'd be fantastic (I can handle using a rice cooker in the morning).  He's said that occasional microwaving is dealable, however; but I'd like to avoid it.\n\n\\* I have a somewhat adventurous palate, so nothing's off the table in terms of taste, cuisine, or appetite.  \n\n\\* I have a tamagakyoki pan and (as mentioned above) a rice cooker with a steamer basket.  I'm also pretty comfortable in a kitchen in general so complicated projects are just fine.  I also have both of Makiko Itoh's \"Just Bento\" cookbooks.\n\n\\* I have a METRIC ASSLOAD of different dried beans and already will be making some kind of bean salads as part of the stash.  \n\n\\* This would be for a middle-aged adult woman with no allergies; however, a few vegetables give me really bad indigestion (broccoli, cauliflower, turnips, savoy cabbage and brussels sprouts) so I avoid them.  (Weirdly, napa cabbage is okay, so kimchi is still an option - fortunately so since I do like it).\n\n\\* I have a small collection of two-tier bento boxes, some silicone liners and a \"Laptop Lunch\" box with 4 different sized containers for food (I opt for that when I'm REALLY brain-dead in the morning and don't want to do math; then it's just \"fill box A with stuff, Box b with different stuff, blerg\").\n\nRight!

Reason being that I've successfully lost a lot of weight over the past year and if there's one thing that taught me, it's that protein is extremely, extremely important. You WILL notice the difference if you do not have enough protein with your meal. I try to eat 1g to 1.5g of protein per kg bodyweight, so I usually shoot for \\~20g of protein for my bento. The rest I eat for breakfast and dinner.\n\nIf I cannot find *anything* suitable to get my protein in, I will throw in a protein bar as a snack, but I will not leave for work without some protein. Nope. Never again.", "Yes here in Japan, we are taught what a well-balanced diet is. Sometimes kids know better than adults likely because adults forget about nutrition when they prioritize convenience over health. Hmm... There's no strict guidelines but it is important that the food should not spoil easily since most bentos are left at room temperature. Most bento boxes are not microwavable. Especially the covers! Meat or fish should be well seasoned and fully cooked. Raw vegetables should be pat dried before adding in to the bento box. Also, avoid saucy foods! They are very moist and they spill! Prioritize on preventing food poisoning. I'm sorry I'm not being helpful.", "I always make sure to include protein and vegetables, otherwise I don't feel full. It'sost of the box\n\nI am trying to get stronger, so protein is pretty important. It fills 30-60% of my box. My favorite protein sources:\n- beans (refried beans are so tasty)\n- chickpeas (roasted, on a salad? Yay)\n- lentils \n- tofu (so many cooking options)\n- textured vegetable protein (great in chili)\n- tempeh (fried in small strips makes a good salad topping)\n- seitan\n- chicken (precooked rotisserie chickens from the grocery store can be rationed and frozen)\n- hummus (easy to make it yourself, but easy to find at the store if you need something quick) \n- peanut butter (sometimes I'll add a spoonful as dessert)\n- maybe a protein drink (if I'm desperate)\n\nVegetables are really important for everything. I start feeling sad if I haven't eaten enough veggies. They fill 30-60% of my box. My favorite vegetables:\n- broccoli (roasted until it's slightly charred)\n- brussel sprouts (roasted, they're not as bitter as they used to be)\n- spring mix (arugula, spinach, etc) (doesn't need a lot of prep work) \n- carrots (cooked or raw)\n\nI also try to include a carb, but that's less than 30% of the total food\n- potato (wedges, mashed, roasted, etc)\n- rice (especially with a saucy protein)\n- bread (naan with the hummus for example) \n- tortillas \n- tortilla chips\n- popcorn\n\nYou also want to include a bit of fats to make it filling. Usually that's taken care of (if you add a bit of olive oil when you roast your vegetables or proteins, nuts, cheese, or dressing on a salad, etc) but if not, a small dessert can fill that (I love peanut butter as a dessert, a small chocolate or cookie works too). \n\nWhen possible, I like to include fruit too. It's not always possible in the middle of winter or at the end of a week, and sometimes I just eat the fruit for breakfast instead\n- A handful of grapes\n- an apple (can be put on a salad)\n- a container of berries\n- melon cut into cute shapes\n- a mandarin fruit cup (they're nice to have as backup)", "When putting together lunches, I always try to check the boxes for *at least one* protein, dairy, grain and/or carb, veggie, fruit and something fun. As long as all my categories are checked, I feel like it\u2019s a balanced meal.", "Bentos are super flexible, but for me personally I always make bento with rice, a protein (usually chicken) along with dipping sauce for the protein and at least one source of veges. The other slots I just fill in with whatever I want like a salad, onigiri, dumplings, etc\u2026", "I focus on high protein and high fiber. It helps me to not overeat personally", "My bento guidelines are to fill that puppy with as much veg as possible, a good protein, and carbs in moderation. I cook the same few veg recipes every single Sunday- japanese potato salad, stewed tomatoes, blanched broccoli, garlic green beans or snap peas, air fried carrot sticks, and parmesean squash chips or parmesean onion chips. Sometimes zucchini katsu.\u00a0\n\n\nFor protein I do ground turkey egg rolls/ pot stickers, tamagoyaki, kaarage or chicken katsu on salad, tsukune, teriyaki turkey meatballs, etc. I also toss in some cocktail sausages cut like octopie.\u00a0\n\n\nAs you can see carbs are already included in some of the above items, so I add grilled tuna rice balls infrequently and almost never use bread. Carbs aren't evil of course, but family health history makes me want to keep my carb intake low.\u00a0\n\n\nMy lunchtime bento is my only meal of the day usually so I go big with it. I have fruit and a cheese stick or something for an evening snack so I do try hard to keep things balanced. Ive been eating like this since new years and I've lost so much weight, got my blood sugar in the healthy range, and feel so much better and less sluggish. I save money by not eating out and save time throughout the week by getting most of my cooking out of the way.", "I always have a 1/2 cup of rice, a main that usually is protein-based, and then my two side dishes are usually veggies and fruits.", "I have a two-cup capacity bento (about), divided into a top half and a bottom half, and I usually have the bottom be my \"filling\" section. Might be leftovers, rice and curry, stuff like that. If it's a salad, top half has to be more filling. The top is my \"snacking\" section. Fresh vegetables, nuts, protein bar, hard-boiled egg, a chocolate, etc. \n\nI eat them at the same time. It's just nice to be snacking while I wait for the microwave (if it's something that doesn't get eaten room temp). \n\nIf I can add a pickle, I often will. Kimchi and pickled ginger are my go-tos. Something probiotic and punchy helps break up the meal.", "I have my own guidelines I follow for simplicity. I usually put things together the night before, and  I need to be able to put things together within 15-20 minutes. Every now and then I will get extra creative and spend more time. Making lunch shouldn't be a job or time suck. \n\nI started several years ago before finding this subreddit. One thing that helped me early on, and that I still refer to are index cards with things we like and want to eat. I did one for fruit, one for veg, and one for proteins. \n\nEvery bento should have some fruit, some, veg, a small variety in case something doesn't taste good or feel appealing upon eating the next day. Try to keep things healthy-ish. Try to keep things a little fun.\n\nI perfer an open style container and then use silicone cupcake liners as customizable compartments. The liners also add color and help with portions. As office workers, I always pack a little extra for variety or snacking. Typically things that aren't used or eaten can be rolled over to part of the next day.", "I wing it most of the time. Carbs in the small one (usually rice but sometimes noodles). Proteins of various types. Usually eggs, cheese, lunch meat, or leftover meat (sometimes homemade meatballs bc I am very gluten free), and then I pack in veggies or fruit.\n\nIf you want some great ideas, check out Imamu Room on Youtube, but you'll have to go back a bit because she doesn't make bentos anymore."]}

This is another play around and find out one but thinking about what's on top of what can help to make something more effective.\n\nNumbers- for some reason the eye generally likes an odd number of things with an exception with the number 2 probably for symmetry reasons.\n\nAs for bento, sectioning seems to be a big factor in posts that I've seen as well so that might be a part prevalent in bento. \n\nThat's my mini food nerd rant more on things to keep in mind and reminder that we live in a world where we have a godly amount of information in our hand. \n\nWays I would quickly and cheeply the bento cuter\n-sweet corn in a cupcake case (preferably silicon)\n-meat shredded and under the rice.\n-a small tomato in the middle of the rice or add texture via peas, carrot, pepper.\n-seaweed art, sushi seaweed is pretty good in terms of quickly adding style if you have an artsy side or a stamp cutter (or alternates)\n\nHappy bento making, remember just like any hobby your enjoyment is personal go full nerd mode or casually partake, ya winning if ya having fun.

No matter what I cook, I put the bento box into the Totoro drawstring bento bag from Bento and Co along with a yakult lite and a small container of fruit (i really like cara cara oranges rn so this week ever day I\u2019ve packed 1 supremed cara cara orange, it\u2019s really easy and makes it look cool). I also usually pack a small reusable water bottle of tea (it\u2019s pretty small, like around the size of a soda can) on the side, since most of the time it doesn\u2019t fit into the bento bag. If you are looking for bento boxes, I\u2019d say Bento and Co (online store) is great for quality bentos, plus they have a big selection of character bentos and normal ones (a lot of my friends like the Gel Cool box).

And because they're two separate boxes, I'll fill one with foods I can reheat (rice and meats) and then the other one with food I eat at room temperature.\n\nFrom what I've seen online, the Mon Bento ones aren't worth the price (I think I paid half that, and they're a cute souvenir).", "I have two silicone lunch boxes (Lunchbots and Ali+Oli) and PackIt Freezable lunch bags for my kids. \n\nGlass would be ideal for reheating, but not ideal for a waddler and preschooler, and trying to stay away from plastic.

I guess sausage would go well with that if going for that morning theme. Something more classic bento would be a rolled tamagoyaki with japanese seasoning. If we're going full japanese bento, rice is pretty obvious choice. Since it's from home, I'd also go with miso soup which isn't really a bento thing, but its very easy to make.\n\nEdit: sorry I didnt read no microwave.

More importantly though, about half the book is dedicated to food prep complete with refrigeration and freezing times for cooked ingredients and complete dishes. \n\nMost cooked foods, including meat, can be frozen from 2-6 months without any issues. Proteins are extremely easy to deal with. If you have a standard stove with 4 burners and an oven you can make 30-60 servings of a variety of proteins in a single day. All you have to do is divide the food into individual portions and freeze them. \n\nFor instance, you can use a square baking pan to make a meatloaf. If you cut it into 9 portions and freeze them individually then you have almost two weeks worth of meatloaf for work lunches. You should easily be able to cook 6 servings of other proteins on each of the stovetop burners while the meatloaf is baking. Let's say 6 servings each of fried chicken, meatballs, hamburger patties, and salmon. With the meatloaf that's 33 servings of assorted protein for work lunches. Assuming a 5-day work week you would have 6 1/2 weeks worth of work lunch proteins. If you feel like spending a few extra hours in the kitchen and your freezer has enough space then you won't have to cook lunch proteins for another 2 months. You can also freeze leftovers from your evening meals to add even more variety.\n\nSo, don't worry about whether or not it's doable. It's actually really easy. Assuming you can already cook basic foods, all you need to do is work out a routine to thaw food so you can nuke it.", "meatball pasta or any red sauce pasta you can freeze/refrigerate and packed cold. japanese curry same thing. perhaps chili, too. you can supplement these dishes with veggies like fresh salad or pickled veggies.", "So this could be a silly suggestion but why not just make an extra serve of dinner that he can have for lunch?"]}

They do seal well as I haven\u2019t had a leak. I don\u2019t eat salads or wet foods from it. Mostly cold lunches but I did leave I guess a decent amount of salad dressing in one of the box after I was done eating and rattling throughout the day in my bag it did not leak.

You can really do bento any way that works for you, including getting a microwave safe (ideally made of glass) container for food you want to eat hot.

I recommend learning the rules before breaking them.  They're actually kinda important in these little boxes because they ensure you get enough food and a good balance of nutrients.\n\nAlso, if you haven't, I'd recommend this guide for [picking a box](https://lunchinabox.net/2007/03/guide-to-choosing-the-right-size-bento-box.html?redirect=true) because its important to know if you can fit your calorie needs in one of these small boxes or if you should consider an additional container.\n\nFor your box, definitely add some veggies and maybe fruit (i liked berries over larger fruits because I didn't have to worry about what to do with the rest of it since it doesn't all go in the box).  For veggies, broccoli, carrots and cauliflower are nice while you're learning because they're squish resistant, unlike a cherry tomato, but any veggie can be used.  Corn kernals are also nice to fill in space.  Dividers are great, just know if you put something juicy in that section, the liquid part of the food can and will go under the divider (if you care or not is a personal preference, I generally don't, but I know people who do).", "Aw cute", "I also have a pretty small box so I feel ya, the one thing I can say is besides space management make sure there\u2019s some sort of protein (like the eggs you included, the faces are cute btw !) or anything that is more complex to digest (such as whole veggies) so that you at least feel full!

If you want to take cut fruit, you can buy small snack containers of various sizes that you can put into your box or have separate.\n\n> When packing dry snacks with lunch, do you pack the night before? Does moisture collected make it soggy?\n\nAbsolutely will go soggy from the condensation. Pack crackers etc in the morning when you are ready to go. If there is condensation on the lid of your box, wipe it down first. \n\nAlso consider what you pack and what you are going to do with it if you are going to reheat any of your food. If you eat your fruit/crackers first it's not a problem, but if you want your main food first..then consider individual containers for your snacks so you can remove them when you reheat. Or get a double layer bento..one layer for main meal to be reheated, top layer for snacks/cold food."]}

The boxes contain a variety of cut veggies with homemade dill dip, grapes (more finger-foody and travels better than sliced apples), leftover chuck roast, Branston's pickle, hard boiled eggs, sliced cheeses (pepper jack and two types of cheddar), homemade pickles from this year's garden (left are my bread and butter, right are his grandma's dill pickle recipe), and a couple wheat rolls I had on hand. Everything here is pretty much standard foods/ingredients we have around the house, except the Branston pickle I bought specifically because of earlier post.

The difference from the ploughman's lunch is crackers instead of bread, high quality sliced lunchmeat rolled and cut into cracker sized chunks, and usually a couple condiments (dijon or stone ground, fig jam, pepper relish). Another bento type meal we do is what we call \"picnic dinner\" which merges our tea time fruit and chai with more savory dishes to make a meal, featuring dishes like chilled grilled salmon or chicken; chicken pasta salad; grilled salmon mixed into a spreadable cheese; caprese avocado salad; soft and hard cheeses;, a variety of fresh fruits (berries, mangos, pineapple, etc.); any number of breads or crackers (mini flat breads, bagel chips, specialty or club crackers, or even sliced baguette); and a thermos of chai (with containers of cream and sugar to finish our mugs).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1h860vb/his_hers_ploughmans_bentos/", "created_utc": 1733504427.0, "score": 26, "author": "deborah_az", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1h860vb/his_hers_ploughmans_bentos/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Looks great!

{"title": "Tips and hacks for meal prepping your bentos?", "selftext": "I try to cut time in the (very) early mornings by prepping things in advance and storing servings in the fridge or freezer so I can just quickly assemble my lunch, but it's been a bit of trial and error learning what stores and reheats well. I'd love to know if anyone else has any trips they can share. Here are some of mine:\n\n* Rice freezes well; store in an air-tight container or cling foil and reheat in the microwave. \n* Tamagoyaki, stir fried or braised veggies, and blanched veggies freeze well, can be packed frozen and will thaw out in your bento by lunchtime. Only issue is they're less malleable in the box when you pack it. \n* Inarizushi (tofu sushi) freezes well; plastic wrapping them individually stops them from drying out. Reheat in the microwave. \n* Carrot kinpira is simple to make and stores well in the fridge for a few days. Don't keep for more than 3-4 days, after which it starts to ferment. \n* Beef is generally great -- reheats without issue out of the fridge or freezer. Gyudon in particular is a favourite. Chicken I prefer to freeze rather than store in the fridge. \n* Meats coated in cornstarch have a funny texture when reheated; if I plan to store in the fridge/freezer, I prefer to skip it. \n* Meat balls are also nifty, can be kept in the fridge or freezer, and reheat well. Easy to pack. \n\nOf course most things would be tastiest made fresh that morning, and I'd love to have some tricks up my sleeve to expedite any cooking where I can.

Obviously, I don\u2019t want to buy a bunch of bento boxes, but is there a way I could transfer my meal prepped food into my bento lunch box easily?\n\n\nI\u2019m a total beginner at this\u2026 been eating out at uni this whole time and just now starting my first job soon and want to start cooking etc.. pls advise me as a total noob!

If there\u2019s stuff you want to freeze, you could flash-freeze portions in baggies to make it easier to transfer them to the bento. I do this pretty often, and even though it takes a little effort each day it\u2019s simple!", "You can buy freezer safe 'bento' boxes with compartments which you will see a lot of meal preppers use, you can also buy cheaper ones that aren't really good for freezing but are perfectly fine for having in the fridge. The point of prepping is to do everything at once for a week or more and not have to do any work again. Just grab a container to go when you need one, hence why people are using multiple of these containers. A lot of people are also tracking macros for various reasons including weight loss..so each container has the exact calories that they need per meal. To measure that every morning would be time consuming and counter productive. They often prep more than 1 meal also so only using one container would not be feasible.\n\nAnd yes..they take those boxes to work as they are microwave safe etc so their food can be reheated in a microwave if necessary.\n\nCould you prep food then transfer it to your bento on the day you want it? Sure. So long as your bento is microwave safe if you want to reheat your food. It just means that you would have to use other food storage containers in your fridge to hold your prepped food, then serve it out into your bento each night/morning, wash your bento at night and repeat.\n\nSo if you want stir fry, rice and salad for your week of lunches..you'd store your stir fry in one container, rice in another and prepped salad items (tomato, cheese, cucumber, carrots..whatever) in their own containers..or if you wanted chicken breast and pasta salad...container for your chopped chicken & container for your pasta salad.. and then serve out into your bento. \n\nIf you wanted to freeze prepped meals, you'd have to consider another option or use zip locks to store portions in so that you could then put them into your bento. \n\nConvenience is why people use multiple containers, nothing more.", "I'm terrible at meal prepping, but when I do, I'll freeze whatever in portions. I like to mix and match my bento foods, and with frozen portions, I can pick whatever I want the night before, stick it in the fridge, then pack my box in the morning. \n\nMy advice is to date whatever it is you're freezing with the date it was made/frozen. I've a bad habit of freezing and forgetting, and I can't remember when I've made something or how old it is. \n\nThe Just Bento cookbooks also address meal prepping and what bento foods you can freeze.

{"title": "Monbento is overpriced garbage that is made of cheap plastic and warps after a few uses. I don't understand the hype.", "selftext": "I'm incredibly disappointed with my Monbento boxes that the internet has hyped up to be \"the best bento boxes.\"\n\nI ordered two bento boxes for myself and my partner. Straight away, I noticed that they were made of cheap plastic, and the internal airtight lids on my partner's bento box did not fit. We tried for a long time to put them on. First, gently and carefully. Then, forcefully and exasperatedly. But the rubber seals around the edges were ripped up by the time we actually got the lids on properly. Before you ask, yes we did read the instructions and watched the videos. Yes, we were putting them on as they are supposed to be.\n\nBut hey, maybe they'll get easier to use the more we use them. Break them in, you know.\n\nI put my partner's bento in the dishwasher (Monbento says they're supposed to be dishwasher safe). Well, they came out and the lids no longer fit at all. They had been warped in the dishwasher, even though they're marketed as being dishwasher safe.\n\nBut hey, maybe my dishwasher just uses hotter water than other standard dishwashers.\n\nI contacted the company and they sent me replacement lids for free. Their customer service does respond fast and they're very nice, and shipped the replacement parts immediately. I no longer put them in the dishwasher and I just hand-wash them.\n\nThe lids can now go on the boxes, but it takes a crazy amount of effort to get them on right (and especially when you're trying to not rip the rubber on them).\n\nThe tabs that you're supposed to pull on to remove the lids are a complete joke. They're completely useless. They do not work at all and I do not understand how this passed QA.\n\nThe plastic stains very, very easily. My bento box permanently has brown and orange spots in it.\n\nAnd tonight, while about to prepare lunch for tomorrow, my bento box, that I've never put in the dishwasher), I found that I could not get the lids back on. At all. Even with the rubber seals ripping. This time, it wasn't the lids that were warped... it was the boxes themselves. Again, these ones have never been in the dishwasher, yet the sides curved inwards. I have no idea how this happened, because honestly I've barely used mine since buying it. The $40 bento box is now completely useless.\n\nBefore you say that any of this was user error, it's not. I followed the instructions that come with the box itself as well as the instructions and guidelines on the website and the videos too. They are supposed to be microwave safe and dishwasher safe. The lids aren't supposed to take several minutes of trying to get them on and a LOT of force to get them off. The rubber is not supposed to rip in the first use. And these were not knock-offs -- I bought directly from their website to specifically avoid any possibility of getting a knockoff (like Amazon does sometimes).\n\nAll of that, plus the outer lid on top doesn't actually attach to any of it, and the boxes don't attach to each other (if you get a box with two compartments) and have to be held in place with the band. That's known before you buy them, so I can't really complain about that, but it is an extra annoyance if you're considering buying one.\n\nI just do not understand why people rave about Monbento being one of the best bento boxes there is when I can find store brand leftover containers that are sturdier, easier to use, easier to carry, don't stain, and are dishwasher safe for less than a quarter of the price of a Monbento. I really tried to give these boxes the benefit of the doubt so many times, because surely there is a reason why people love these boxes. But I truly have no idea why.\n\nIf you're looking at buying a Monbento, DON'T. There are so many other brands out there that are so much more budget friendly, are all around better quality, and aren't extremely frustrating to use. I also know that seeing something made right in France and not a Chinese factory is alluring, but I promise, it's not worth it. I wonder if a lot of these positive reviews I see on Reddit for Monbento are just astroturfing.\n\nI want my $80+ dollars back.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bento/comments/1gol4v6/monbento_is_overpriced_garbage_that_is_made_of/", "created_utc": 1731303583.0, "score": 51, "author": "DaydreamerJane", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Bento/comments/1gol4v6/monbento_is_overpriced_garbage_that_is_made_of/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I have several Monbento boxes and I have to say there\u2019s a difference between the original ones made in France and the newer ones made in China (or wherever).

If you want really nice quality, I\u2019d recommend one, or a metal one. \n\nFor something microwaveable and sturdy, you can use a glass container and silicone lid.

I have gotten lucky just buying cute random ones on Amazon and top rack them in my dishwasher, although my most recent two are from Miniso (Cinnamoroll and Kuromi) and they're fine. I don't send the lids through because of the paint, but they go through fine. \n\nProbably a manufacture issue, changing who makes their products can make a huge difference.

I am a long time lurker of this subreddit, and I frequently think, \"gosh, I should take photos of my boxes sometimes too.\" So, here I am!\n\nI have ADHD, which makes it hard for me to balance what I'm eating and when. And I have a health condition that responds best to eating frequent, small meals. The combination couldn't be worse! I don't usually need a lunch box because I work from home, but it occurred to me that I could make meals for myself ahead of time, fill them with snacks, and graze on said box over the course of a few hours while I work. That way I'm not rushing to eat a big meal before it goes cold, and I have a variety of things to nibble.\n\nSo I ordered a few bento inserts (the brand here is bentgo) and gave it a go! I usually make either a big brunch box (pictured here) or a breakfast box and a lunch box. Sometimes I switch it up, and I'll have a lunch box and dinner box! It's great because I can make multiple boxes at once and just grab them out of the fridge as I need them throughout the day.\n\nAs I have ADHD, I wasn't confident I'd be able to stick to the routine of making myself food like this. I told myself that as long as I do this for over half of my work week, it's a success. I've been doing it since August and I'm so proud I've kept up with it!\n\nAnyway, pictured:\n\nBLTA: one brioche roll cut in half, one slice of bacon cut in half for each sandwich, Campari tomatoes, a little arugula in place of lettuce, a quarter avocado per half, and some garlic aioli. Cottage cheese, best consumed with a yogurtland spoon (lol). Watermelon.\n\nThis is my brunch box so I've only got one box today! Next time I make two, I'll be sure to take photos to share. :)", "Yummy", "[deleted]", "That looks hearty and delicious!!"]}

These are pretty easy to make the night before. For things like katsu or karage\u2014you can bake it or air fry it. For things like bulgogi, you can buy thin sliced meat like the kind for cheesesteaks, marinate the meat, and then quickly cook and serve over rice. For chicken salad, you can buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it. Tuna/salmon? Buy the little packs. \n\nThe key to a basic bento is to make it with little extra work\u2014smarter not harder. After all, it is often busy moms or kids making these things\u2014just like in the US, our moms might make us a pb&j or lunchmeat sandwich.\n\nThen you can add apples (i add a small container of nut/seed butter to dip), orange slices, berries, cookies or bite sized candies\u2026\n\nOnce you kinda get the hang of the bento making, you can make more time in your day to make fancier bentos like the onigiri or the character bentos.\n\nAnd hey, if all else fails? You can always put whatever you ate for dinner last night into your bento.", "If you want efficiency, I'd recommend meal prepping 5 portions of any dish on sunday and just transferring them into your lunch box every day, rather than needing to make something fresh every morning. Leftover dinners are great too.\n\nI would recomend packing whatever you already enjoy eating for lunch, and starting from there.", "I have a similarly sized bento box as the round one. I will fill one container with rice and maybe some protein, like leftover diced chicken tossed with Japanese barbecue sauce or a soy sauce egg, or leftover fried rice; the other half is usually some veggies, like shelled edamame, broccoli, or green beans, some kimchi, and some berries or diced fruit in a little silicone cupcake liner.\n\nTo make bento packing easier, I always have frozen pucks of rice, frozen veggies, easy to prep fruit and hard-boiled eggs on hand. I've also prepped freezer packs of dry curry, soboro meat, and sweet pepper and onion confit to make it easy to pack a bento on the fly.\n\nIn addition to Just One Cookbook, I also like JustBento.com for recipes.", "[This is THE BEST for bento info](https://justbento.com/)"]}

The yeti one is better with insulation, but the handbag one was cheaper by a long way. It can hang off my arm and fits in a medium sized basket and pannier bag too.

If you want to try packing Japanese food, onigiri and rolled omelettes are something you'll see often. You could try making other foods though. I personally really like having a meat + rice + vegetable side dish combo. \n\nWhatever you decide to pack, make sure it can keep cold enough with just an ice pack, unless you have access to a refrigerator. If you don't have a microwave you can use on campus either, it'd be a good idea to pack stuff that's good cold or at room temperature.", "Are you looking for cookbooks? Effortless Bento is my go to!", "How much cooking space/equipment do you have? How much time in the morning?\n\nMaximum bento nutrition for minimum effort is, imo, an insulated soup jar + onigiri (or bread/sandwich if you want a different carb \u2014 actually, noodles work well too because you can pack them separately and pour the hot soup over when it\u2019s time to eat).\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out and want to do the typical Japanese rice + sides bento, I\u2019d start off by aiming for a two-side bento: one protein forward side and one veg-forward side. If you prep and make 2 protein sides and 2 veg sides, you can mix and match and not repeat the same meal in a week, which is nice.\n\nLeaner cuts of meat do better because they don\u2019t get that congealed fat layer when they are at room temperature. Chicken ham, beef shigure-ni, lean pork stir fries all work well. Eggs are bento kings for a reason too \u2014 small omelets and tamagoyaki never go amiss. Once you get comfortable with the rolling technique, it\u2019s easy to add different vegetables or roll around sausages, etc for variety. \n\nBut again, a lot of this is going to come down to your equipment and time. \n\nDo you have a big fridge? A freezer? How many gas hobs? Knives and work space? Dishwasher (this is more important than you might think \u2014 if you don\u2019t have a dishwasher, you might want to aim for bentos that generate the smallest amount of washing up)?", "What do you like to cook/eat?
