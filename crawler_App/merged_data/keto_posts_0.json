{"title": "1 Year on Keto: Over 500lbs Down to 229lbs", "selftext": "39/m 6'3, 229lbs\n\nA bunch of pictures:\n\n[https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/](https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/)\n\nSo I lost a lot of weight in one year.  Maybe that's an understatement.  I've been going back and forth on whether to post my update or not.  I'm not trying to brag or show off.  I'm posting more for motivation for people who haven't started Keto or are just beginning. If i can do it, so can you.  \n\n  \nQuick story:\n\nLife was not great Pre\\-Keto.  I was over 500lbs.  I don't know my exact weight because no scale I had could weigh me.  I had problems getting around. I couldn't stand for long periods of time. I constantly was sweating and always hot.  I'm still upset that I let myself get so bad.  When people say i look great I'm more embarrassed for how I looked to begin with.  \n\nIt took me ruining a family vacation to Universal Studios to begin the process in my mind that I have to lose weight.  I was looking forward to going to the Harry Potter area for years.  I was so excited when we got there.  However, I could barely get around.  Walking around was nearly impossible.  I would have to strategically plan my steps and look ahead for a bench to rest.  I ended up seeing a fraction of the Harry Potter area and instead went to an restaurant w/ AC just so I wouldn't have to walk around.  One day, I will have to make it up to my wife and son and take them back so we actually enjoy Universal Studios.  I wish I could say I went home and began Keto. It would take me another 8 months before I actually decided to start this 'journey'.  \n\nLike I said, I don't know my exact weight when i started.  It took me about 5 months before I actually got on a scale.  I was frightened to see the number that would be staring back at me.  I can guesstimate it was over 500lbs as the first time I weighed myself I was @ 386.  I have to figure in 5 months I lost over 114lbs.   \n\nMy diet regimen: I went right into One meal a day.  For me it was really easy.  I stayed in a calorie range from 800\\-1100 a day.  I know that is VERY low and definitely not for everyone.  However,  I never felt like i was starving or famished.  I quickly got into a groove and never looked back.  It helps that I'm stubborn and not a quitter. If I commit to something I'm not going to give up. I never had a cheat day or meal (nor will I).  I know cheat days are not bad but I would feel awful if i ever went off the rails.\n\nI only weighed myself once a month.  I dont want to do live and die w/ the scale.  At Halloween I was 386, when I last weighed myself on June 1 i was 229.  I think the secret for me on Keto was meal planning and cooking in bulk.  I'd smoke a pork shoulder or some chicken on Sunday and have food for the next week or longer.  \n\nThese items made Keto easy for me:\n\n\\-Cauliflower rice was a god send.  There is so much I have done with it.\n\n\\-Shirataki noodle. They are not for everyone but I love them.\n\n\\-Butt Rub. It's a great spice and it's very Keto friendly\n\n\\-Rao's Pasta sauce.   I love that stuff.  Low in carbs and so tasty.\n\nI started out wearing 7xl and 8xl tshirts.  My shorts and sweats were 4xl.  \n\nToday, i'm wearing an XL shirt and L shorts.  Yes, there is A LOT of hanging skin.\n\n When I reflect on my weight loss and where I came from, I think of a movie line from Apollo 13.  It's when Tom Hanks is talking to Kathleen Quinlan after their party looking at the Moon and what it took to get there.\n\n\"It's not a miracle.  We just decided to go.\"   \n\nI just decided to go.

I'm just an ordinary guy and I was able to hit my goals. Not always with ease but I was able to get through them.\n\nThis is a day that until recently I thought I wouldn't never see. I'm officially under 200 lbs.\n\nI started at 545 lbs in January 2016 and today, in June 2019, I'm 199.8.

I went from having trouble fitting into an airline seats,to as of recently being able to jump out of one to skydive. Im grateful for all the support along the way and for those that have supported be since the beginning.\n\nAfter going through all this, I'm a firm believer that there isn't anything that can't be achieved by myself or anyone else as long as you put in some time, dedication and have a little determination (or stubbornness).

Diagnosed, grandma, dad, mom, 3 uncles, and both brothers.  Dead from diabetes, grandma and oldest brother. Incapacitated from stroke dad and uncle. \n\nOk so knowing this history you'd think we would as a group change the way we eat.  Research, read, study, try something so we all don't die.  But no it's just pills and doctor visits and death.  \n\nAbout a year ago I started eating Keto.  I've been to the doctor.  I've lowered my  blood pressure, cholesterol, and my a1c is a 5.  I feel better mentally than I have my entire life.  The constant pain and depression is gone.  I only lost 35 pounds.  I'm still fat, but I feel so damn healthy.  I sleep better, when I'm awake I'm actually awake.  I get stuff done.  Being alive feels good. \n\nSo to continue with my family story, I went to a wedding shower for my niece.  They had a \"pasta bar\" and a \"dessert bar\"  Holy shit, it was carbs as far as they eye could see.  Being the rude bitch I am (according to people who think it's rude not to accept the hospitality) I didn't eat anything.  I drank black coffee and watched my mother eat. And eat she did, penne Alfredo, lasagna, breadsticks, and cake.  20 min later she was in my car literally crying.  Sweaty, cold, red, nauseous, dizzy.  I probably should have taken her to the hospital.  She was crying \"my body has betrayed me!\"  It was horrible.  And I was angry.  Why does she do this to herself? Why do my family think this is ok? She texted me a day later and said \"for some reason my blood sugar spiked\"  Really mom?? For some reason?\n\nShe's 28 years older than me.  I'm going to eat low carb for the next 30 years and enjoy the next 30  years of my life.  I fucking refuse to do that to myself.  I am NOT going to die like that.  I'm going to change my family.

It's a day I had hoped for but never thought I would ever see. On the left, we see me before caring about my health and in the middle and right, we see a picture of me from today (with terrible bed hair).That my friends is a 300 lb difference. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom in order to really make a change. My rock bottom was me going to the doctor because my heart was palpitating and the doctor telling me I was pre-diabetic and that he was putting me on pills. At 25, I fucking refused  let this be my life. I didn't know how I was going to do it, but I knew that this time, I was going to lose weight. Luckily I found Atkins /low carb and later keto and here we are. I went from a 7XL shirt to now being able to pull off an LT. Thanks to a little dedication (stubbornness more than anything else), 300 lbs is gone that will never come back. I refuse to ever go back to how I was. It hasn't always been easy. Even though the diet itself is straight forward there's times where I've over thought ever single I've eaten because I was afraid in the back of mind that it would cause me to go back to the me on the left (scared to have that piece of pizza, or bite of cake, etc) . I've gotten alot better but it still sometimes lingers in the back of my mind. But I ultimately know that if I ever do have a set back, I won't let it undo everything I've worked hard to do these last few years. My best piece of advice for anyone that does want to lose weight is just to start somewhere. Go for walks, count carbs or calaries, go to the gym, find a diet that works for you. I feel like diet plays the biggest part of losing weight. Not popping some bullshit pill or drinking some bullshit shake, it has to come from you. I'm still not quite at my final goal, I'd like to lose 25 lbs more but I can honestly say, I'm so glad I hit this milestone. I'm grateful that according to my most recent labs, I'm in good health all around.

No matter what diet or exercise routine I tried, I just could not find anything that stuck. I was a major emotional eater, which led to binge eating. Food was pretty much my solution for everything. People would tell me that I just needed to eat in moderation and that if I deprived myself, I would never be able to sustain it. But I literally craved binging more than the actual foods I was eating, so I didn't know how to not binge and not feel deprived. On my last attempt at losing weight before Keto, I was in a weight loss competition at my gym. I counted calories and worked out like crazy, but it seemed like my body would just not lose weight. I finally started alternating between juice fasts and egg fasts in order to lose the weight and win the contest, but obviously that was not anything sustainable and I gained it all back (plus some) as soon as the contest was over. I felt completely hopeless and I thought that all of the years of dieting had finally screwed up my metabolism like everyone said it would, and now I would no longer be able to lose weight. On top of that, my mind was completely burned out on the constant dieting and I just had no willpower or determination left. I was to the point of pretty much just resigning to be overweight. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don't know what made me start Keto on 3/29/17. It's the first time I ever just started a diet out of the blue. Normally I would have waited till Monday and binged on anything and everything the weekend before. 3/29 was a Wednesday and I had already eaten a high sugar breakfast that morning. It was completely out of character for me to start a diet in the middle of the day, but for some reason, I just decided to make a healthier choice and eat a salad rather than go get fast food for lunch like I normally would have. From there, I just made another healthy choice for dinner. Then the next day I started tracking in MFP and watching my calories and carbs. After that, I used the Keto Calculator to calculate my macros and I was all in. Keto has been life-changing for me. I still love food and I enjoy everything I eat on Keto, but I don't need it the way I used to. It doesn't run my life anymore. I am so proud to say that I have not binged once since I started! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust like everyone else, I had stalls, weeks where I didn't lose, weeks where I could tell my body was holding on to water, etc. While that can be tough, I just stayed consistent and kept going. I tracked everything religiously and didn't cheat (aside from a planned splurge on Christmas day - 9 months into my journey). I am definitely Keto for life! It makes me feel great and I still get to enjoy food without sacrificing how I look and feel. I am still debating whether I want to lower my goal weight a few more pounds, but I'm going to eat at maintenance for a bit and shift my focus to building muscle. I've been lifting since October, so I am going to continue that and see if toning my muscles will get me where I want to be. If not, I may go back to a deficit and lose a little more. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI wish I had tried Keto so much earlier. I wasted all of those years on bad diets that made me feel terrible. Almost as soon as I started Keto, it just felt like this is what I was supposed to be doing all along. If you're on the fence about starting, just do it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n I'm happy to answer any questions!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7s6dop/goal_pics_nsfw/", "created_utc": 1516634164.0, "score": 5879, "author": "GFEmmers", "num_comments": 434, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/7s6dop/goal_pics_nsfw/", "html_title": ""}

I updated the flawed previous image!Sadly, as i am not a graphic designer in any shape or form, i could not foresee the many problems i encountered. This lead to the final image being a bit hard to read, but oh well. I sank 15 hours into it, and redoing everything would take the same amount so, this is it for now.\n\nI like to believe that i took the advice from the previous thread and fixed the problems that it had. It became a more informational and more correct image, but then again i am repeating myself, it became hard on the eyes and a bit complex. Also, with the introduction of categories, the text became harder to read (yet still readable on modern displays). During the making of this, i noticed that the site i used for the nutritional information probably isn't the best choice, but i hope and believe that it is close enough for it to not matter.\n\nAnyways, its resolution is 12,000 x 7,000 so zooming shouldn't be a problem. I will provide a link to the full image (40mb) in the comments as posts get tagged as \"spam\" if they have more than 1 link in them.\n\nI hope that you like it and find it useful despite its flaws!\n\nEdit : :OOOOOO I forgot to rearrange the chinese cabbage. Since there are like 3 different types, i summed them up between raw and cooked and i got a new value. Then i forgot to move it and now the carbs go from 2,1 -> 1 -> 2,7 . Ooft.\n\nEdit 2 : The grams of carbs are \\*net carbs\\*.Edit 3 : I should've added a flame symbol next to the meat category + possibly consider making a version with grams of protein/fat instead of %.Also, obligatory thank you for the silver and gold. Not really sure what they do but hey! Thanks again!\n\nEdit 4 : This is not an \"eat only these\" guide. Its purpose is to cover the basics. I might have missed a thing or two but i will never be able to fit every food in it. You can always check the nutritional values of items you like but are not in this image.\n\nAlso, the values are not per serving size, they are per 100 grams across all items. Yes, for example, you arent supposed to eat 100g of nuts, but you can always calculate from the numbers i have provided. 100 grams are 0.220lbs.\n\nEdit 5: Thank you to all for the kind words! I try and respond to the more interactive comments but upvoting really isnt enogh for the people who are thankful. Thanks to you for taking the time to check this out and write me a comment! Cheers!  \n\n\nEdit 6 : The eggs' values for protein and fats % are reversed. There is a possibility that there are 1-2 more items that have the same issue. It is not a gigantic problem, but i will fix them and post an updated picture with other small tweaks needed to be done.

{"title": "PSA From a Starbucks barista", "selftext": "Frappuccinos CANNOT be made keto. If you swap whole milk for heavy cream and sweetener for sugar free vanilla, all you've done is consume half a cup of heavy cream and ~40g+ carbs from our emulsifying frappuccinos base, which is a thick sugary syrup. (Yesterday I clocked in and someone managed to gulp down a large frappuccino like this and tell the person at register she was on a LCHF diet and it was delicious and wanted a second. I was busy taking orders in the drive thru and couldn't help the poor woman.) ALSO please do not try to drink a grande heavy cream latte. Even a tall, has 10 oz of milk (2 oz espresso and the rest milk for 12 oz). If you would like an espresso drink, order a hot or iced americano with heavy cream, which would be espresso + water + milk, and you can add any of the sugar free syrups if you like. \n\nIf you are unsure if we put heavy cream in your coffee (you can usually tell because heavy cream can leave small undisolved particles in your drink which go away when stirred, or if the color seems too dark) then ask us. We understand dietary restrictions and want to make sure you get what you are paying for!\n\nOur ice coffee and ice tea come sweetened, as instructed by our recipes. Our cold brew ice coffee does not, but ask for all of these unsweetened anyways, then substitute whatever you like, out of sugar free vanilla or sugar free cinnamon dolce (mixing them together is heaven for me). Our skinny mocha sauce contains few carbs depending on the size, if it fits in your macros it can help curb a mean chocolate craving. Our hot coffee and hot tea do not come pre-sweetened and you have the same syrup options as above, or your own. These are the safest options for getting what you want, esp. a nice dark roast pour over... \ud83e\udd24 anyways.. We use Kerry gold butter squares you can ask for on the side if you like as well. \n\nLastly, if you have any questions AT ALL, do not be afraid to ask your register person or a barista that doesn't look too busy. We also have a designated person that can help customer needs, they can usually be found wearing a timer attached to their apron, restocking and cleaning things, if your register person is busy. Whether it's for how to order a drink, or what have you, don't be afraid! It took me at least a month to be able to remember even most of the menu, it can be daunting.  The only thing we wouldn't know, is the nutrition info for your drink, because most of these require some math. \n\nI know for most people Starbucks is unnessecary, but for those who regularly get their energy fix here, I thought this would help as these are some of the things I notice LCHF customers seem to have confusion with. I'm open to any questions you guys might have! KCKO!\n\nEdit for clarification: The recipes for our ice teas and ice coffees, by default, say to add pumps of sweetener. However, they are brewed with plain tea leaves/plain coffee grinds. :)\n\nEdit 2: it's also worth noting our egg bites have 9g carbs for bacon ones and 11g carbs for egg white ones, they have added rice starch sadly. On frappucinnos; you can ask to get your drink blended without base emulsifier, but the flavor and texture will be no where near the same and some stores will say no. On drink recommendations; everyone's taste is different so I recommend googling some Starbucks keto recipes and trying what you think might be good :)\n\nEdit 3, the edit to end all edits: if you guys are unsure if you're drink is ok, the safest thing you can do is log it, and that goes for any food or drink you might have going past your lips. Nutrition info for half and half, 2%, most almond milks, etc. are all online, again I don't know for your specific drink, so it's safer to look it up! Second, *frappuccinos are not keto.* you can attempt at a keto \"frappuccino\" but by standards it's not a frappuccino, the baristas *can and might* say no, the consistency is not the same, and they might put in the emulsifier base anyways. Third, I'm not gonna tell you not to drink a whole cup of heavy whipping cream, I'm just warning everyone that it's not smart to drink 6, 10, 14, or 18 oz. of heavy whipping cream in one go (short, tall, grande, and Venti respectively). If you can't live without your grande heavy cream flat white then don't.

In terms of teas, we have Black, Green, White, and Passion tea \\(an herbal tea\\).\n   * We also have our infusions! In these guides, I always see the Iced tea mentioned but never the infusions. The infusions are really just herbal teas and they can completely change the flavor of your drink! We have Pineapple, Peach, and Strawberry \\(some locations may vary\\). You can combine and of them with the teas and it will likely turn out amazing! \\(I personally haven't tried any of them with the passion tea\\)\n   * When ordering, just ask for your tea with the infusion and unsweetened. For Example, \"Venti Iced Green Tea with the Pineapple Infusion and unsweetened\"\n* Hot Teas and Coffee\n   * Our hot teas and drip coffee come unsweetened by default. You can get whatever you want. You can also ask them to steam a little bit of heavy cream on top. Make sure to specify a little bit, otherwise they might make it a \"misto\" Which is half coffee/tea and half heavy cream.\n* Iced Coffee/Cold Brew\n   * There is a lot you can do with iced coffee and cold brew. Our Iced coffee get classic syrup by default, so be sure to specify that you want it \"unsweetened.\"\n   * We currently have two sugar free syrups, Cinnamon Dolce and Vanilla. I personally recommend the vanilla \\(not a big fan of the cinnamon dolce\\). We also have a \"skinny\" mocha. The skinny mocha is sugar free, but it is sweetened with sucralose, which can affect blood sugar levels, so it\u2019s best to consume this in moderation. By the way, it can successfully kill a chocolate/mocha craving. :\\)\n   * If your are getting a sugar free syrup/skinny mocha, make sure to specify the number of pumps you want depending on the size. I recommend 2 for a tall, 3 for a grande, and 4 for a venti of sugar free syrups and 1 of skinny mocha in a tall/grande and 2 in a venti.\n   * You can also ask for light Heavy Cream or light Almond Milk on top.\n* Keto \"Pink Drink\"\n   * Now, let me start this by saying this taste absolutely NOTHING like our normal pink drink, so don't expect it to. Although it is a close color and tastes very intriguing. In order to order it, ask for this:\n   * \\[Tall,Grande,Venti\\] Iced Passion Tea with No Liquid Cane Sugar, \\[2,3,4\\] pumps of sugar free vanilla and light heavy cream on top.\n   * If you want it to look more like the Pink Drink, You can ask them to add the Freeze Dried strawberries to it.\n* Keto Carmel Macchiato.\n   * This drink will likely be higher in carbs than the previous options, coming in around 5\\-6 grams of carbs. Also, I wouldn't recommend anything bigger than a grande. A grande would probably have 6\\-8 grams of carbs in it, a tall would be around 3\\-6. Also, the hot version will have more carbs than the iced version because there is more milk. Ask for it like this:\n   * \\[Tall,Grande\\] Skinny Caramel Machiato with almond milk and no caramel drizzle.\n   * if it fits your macros, you can ask for light caramel drizzle, which will add about 2\\-3 carbs to your drink.\n   * Our almond milk has 5 grams of carbs per cup. A tall iced will likely have about 5oz of almond milk while the hot will have around 10oz.\n   * You can ask for heavy whipping cream \\(around 7g of carbs per cup\\) but it will also have over 800 calories for a cup. Additionally, you can go half heavy cream half almond milk if you'd like.\n* Keto Mocha\n   * This is a great option for those occasional Chocolate cravings. Half and Half steams a lot better than heavy cream, so if you can spare the carbs, go with \"breve\" over heavy cream \\(it will also have significantly less carbs.\n   * How I order it: Short mocha with three pumps of skinny mocha. Breve\n   * You can adjust the pumps of mocha to your taste.\n* Keto Doubleshot.\n   * One of my go\\-to drinks that I still enjoy every time. I love this drink. A venti doubleshot will have five shots of espresso shaken with ice in a shaker then topped off with 2&#37; milk. Simply substitute the 2&#37; with light heavy cream or almond milk! I like to flavor mine with sf vanilla, but play around with the recipe to find what you like!\n   * How I order: Venti Starbucks Doubleshot on Ice Unsweetened with almond milk and sugar free vanilla.\n* Keto Chai\n   * This one I get only occasionally because im not positive of the amount of carbs in it, but it should be relatively low. Its just like our chai tea latte with little compromise \\(not watery like the chai tea back\\) I also usually get more pumps of the chai because I like the spice. here's how I order:\n   * \"Grande Iced Lightly Sweet Chai Latte, NO liquid cane, 3 Splenda \\(or sweetener of your choice\\), breve.\"\n   * The sweetener is optional, bUt I think it adds a lot to the taste.\n\n**Things to Eat:**\n\nIf you ever have to eat at Starbucks, im sorry! We don't have that many options. Here are some of my go\\-tos though\n\n* The inside of a panini! I usually get either the turkey pesto panni or the chicken and double smoked bacon and eat the insides of it. The turkey pesto is relatively filling if you combine it with a drink from above.\n* Most Starbucks will have almonds, some sort of cheese, or a cheese and salami tray.\n* The Egg and cheese protein box. leaving the fruit.\n* The new meal sized BLT Turkey protein box. I leave the bread off.\n* On occasion ill get the Bacon sous vide egg bites, but very rarely. I usually rub a pat of butter on them and eat them. Beware that they do have 9g of carbs for both \\(11g from the egg white bites\\)\n* Edit: **Moon Cheese!:** These crunchy little cheese balls are amazing and are 100&#37; cheese! I eat these every time my store gets it in but we always sell out! It truly is a godsend when you miss that \"crunchy\" texture! Also great in salad and other foods\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n* If you think your Iced Tea is too watery, ask for no water! We usually put 50&#37; tea and 50&#37; water and then add ice! I personally never get water in my teas.\n* If you want Splenda or another sweetener in your tea, ask the barista to shake it into the tea, it will usually taste better because it will be more dissolved/incorporated in.\n* On that note, always make sure your tea is shaken! All us barista SHOULD shake the teas but sometimes we forget \\(and some baristas don't at all\\) but it definitely WILL make it better! Especially with the infusions.\n\n**Things To Note:**\n\n* Our Almond Milk only has 5g of carbs per 8 ounces, making it one of the lowest carb milk options we have.\n   * Coconut milk has 8g per 8 ounces\n   * Soy has 13g per 8 ounces\n* Our Teas and Iced Coffee's come with syrup in the recipe, but we can remove it upon request!\n* We have two sugar free syrups currently available: Vanilla and Cinnamon Dolce\n* If you're feeling fancy, we can make you a pour\\-over, which is where we brew a coffee fresh for you using the \"pour\\-over\" method. You can choose any of our coffees \\(some stores have more variety than others\\)\n* Our whipped cream is Heavy Cream and regular vanilla syrup, so it does have a good amount of carbs. However, it is fresh and delicious, so you can ask for just a little bit on top of your drink if it fits your macros.\n* Your barista is willing to help you! Just be nice and let them know you cannot eat sugar and ask them for a suggestion!\n\n**Things To Avoid:**\n\n* Frappuccinos. It doesn't matter if you get it \"light\". The light base has 50&#37; less sugar than the regular one, but it still have enough sugar to knock you out of ketosis. While you can ask for any drink blended, They won't stick together and the liquid will separate from the blended ice.\n* Refreshers: Bottom line, our refreshers have a lot sugar. making them not suitable for Keto.\n* Stevia: Our stevia is mixed with fructose and has 2g of carbs per packet.\n* Breakfast Sandwich \"Insides\": The eggs inside the breakfast sandwiches all have carbs due to the mixture used. This includes the wraps.\n* Any regular syrup: This one is kind of self\\-explanatory, But you'd be surprised how many people say they are low carb and ask for \"only three pumps\". On average, each pump of our regular syrups have 4\\-6g of carbs.\n* White Mocha: There is no skinny version of this.\n* Matcha: Our matcha is a mix that comes pre\\-sweetened.\n* Chai: Our chai mix has a ton of carbs. Even the lightly sweet chai has carbs. However, our chai tea bags have no carbs.\n\nBe sure to drop any questions in the comments! I'll try to answer them all! I hope your guys found this helpful. Ill try to update this as I remember more details. Additionally, please feel free to comment what you get at Starbucks, I can add it to this guide to help other users!\n\nEdit: Thank you SO much to the anonymous redditor who gave me my first ever gold!!!!!!!!

{"title": "A plea to all the seasoned Keto-ers on this sub to be kind to the noobs.", "selftext": "I started Keto over a year ago when I was diagnosed as \"pre-diabetic\", insulin resistant, and had other health problems.  EVERYONE in my life was against me doing keto, always telling me that it was a crazy fad diet and unhealthy, etc.  I had ZERO support in my life and relied on this sub as my support system.  It takes a while to synthesize all the information, and I found mostly great support on here.  All it took, however, was the occasional meany (telling me I was an idiot or making snarky comments) to get me down.  Many of us on here are trying to make a healthy change to save our lives and don't know all the information right out of the gate.  Please be kind to the noobs who are here looking for information and have questions.  If you have some information to share with a poster, just be kind (or at least just matter of fact) or just don't comment at all.  I've just introduced a friend to Keto and this sub, and going through it today I saw a few really snarky comments to noobs, and remembered what that was like when I was a noob.\n\nEdit: THANK YOU KIND STRANGER for the gold!!!  First time ever being gilded!!!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you to everyone who replied to this post!  Even some of the \"negative\" comments (not really that negative) were helpful.

{"title": "Finnally got on a scale... It wasn't at all what I expected.", "selftext": "So, my life was kind of at a rock bottom. I had a spouse who regularly threatened me, controlled me, and manipulated me. So, I ate. \n\nNow, I'd always been a big guy all my adult life (over 300 lbs), but when I was eating to cope, I ate so much, that one day when I stepped on a scale, I realized I had ballooned up to almost 350 lbs. \n\nI had done Keto once before, very successfully, so I wanted to start again. The last time I only stopped because my spouse demanded it. \n\nWell, this time I stopped listening. Not just about the food. I took my life back, filed for divorce, and ate what I chose to eat. \n\nI didn't even buy a scale. After moving out, I had very little. I slept on a folded up blanket on the floor for the first month. I had to make sure my child had everything he needed, first. A scale just wasn't a priority. I was eating Keto because it made me feel better. The number didn't matter. \n\nI don't track my carbs or my calories. I just stick to low carb foods and I eat when I'm hungry. That's it. \n\nSo, in an effort to get some sort of furniture together, I went down to the Salvation Army store. And on the shelf there, there was a bathroom scale. \n\nI thought, \"I've never been under 300 lbs, in my adult life. It would be awesome if I was down to 299 by now.\" \n\nSo I got on the scale, just to see, with clothes and shoes and everything. \n\nI was convinced it was broken. I ended up having to ask someone else to stand on it (someone who knew what they weighed) to make sure it worked. \n\nI'm 279 lbs. I don't even know how to process that. \n\nI'm getting my life back, slowly, and it is hard to think about all the time I wasted not doing the things I needed to for myself. But this is one I will stick to.\n\nEdit: Omg, gold? Thank you. The outpouring of support from this community has been heart-warming. Thank you all. I'm replying to everyone I can.

{"title": "250lbs lost with keto. One week post skin surgery.", "selftext": "Hey keto friends! I wanted to share over here what I shared in another similar diet subreddit, because it was just as much your community and support system here that got me to where I am today!\n\n**TLDR: Picture album at the bottom.**\n\nThings start pretty fast if you are scheduled for a morning run. You get to the hospital and into the surgical pre-op staging room. Here you get to meet all the wonderful people like your nurses, assistant anesthesiologist, anesthesiologist, surgeon and more. Each of which you will end up forgetting. They ended up putting the IV in my foot, which I hear is rare, as they would be flipping me around like a short order cook making pancakes through the procedure. One of the final things that happened is my surgeon came along with his purple crayons and did some impressionistic art on me. Anyways, shortly after this I was wheeled away and honestly taken to what I assume was the surgical theater, after this photo was taken, I don't remember a thing that happened to me.\n\nIt's one of the most jarring things I can think of in life, coming out of a fog where you just feel lost and cheated of your time on earth. Before you open your eyes you can think of nothing but a void, no dreams or thoughts happened. To me, I just ceased to exist at this time. I was pretty out of it, but I remember my mom telling me that things didn't exactly go as planned. The surgeon said he wanted to do a perfect job, and to do so required him making the planned surgery go from 3.5 hours to 7. And in this time he took away 10lbs of skin, repaired my abdominal muscle wall (OWE), relocated my nipples, and gave me a brand new belly button. I later found out that scheduling was pretty upset at him because there was another procedure lined up after me. He ended up buying the nurses for me and the patient after a bunch of pizza to make up for the long hours!\n\nDue to the time I had been out and under anesthesia, and the amount of work he did on me and took away from me, the doctor ordered that I remain overnight. Normally it's a same day surgery, unfortunately not for me. He was worried I'd have some severe pain as well as a lot of recovering to do from the trauma I incurred (thankfully, I only lost 1/2 unit of blood. How do they measure that by the way?). Next thing I remember from my brief moment of existence in the surgical recovery room was waking up in the main hospital. It was here I spent the next 20 or so hours where I thankfully had some of the best nurses looking after me. Here actually my main pain was from the gas that was building up inside my gut, and my inability of being able to use my abdominal muscles. I didn't care about the pain, they just plain would not respond to me! Also, after countless IV's and cups of water with out output on my end, they gave me an ultimatum. Pee in this hand held urinal sometime soon, or we are going to have to catheterize you. That got my body working it's #1 pipes again at least.\n\nAs nice as it is to be waited on and taken care of by professionals, I wanted out of that place. I despise IV's and the burning they leave in your hand, and the thought of the infection found there just gives me nightmares. Though, they did prepare a pretty solid clam chowder. While my blood pressure kept dropping on each vitals readings, it finally stabilized as long as I kept my compression binder on (within those first 24 hours I would very nearly pass out, get clammy, go def/blind if it got taken off). Walking a bit with the nurses and getting a brief checkup from the surgeon though I was finally discharged! The ride home was full of cursing each bump and pothole my wonderful city takes pains to maintain. But I made it, and into what ended up being the most wonderful recovery bed/recliner that I lived in for about three days.\n\nSince then I've thankfully progressed enough to consider myself more or less independent and moved bad at my own apartment, just needing assistance here and there from my roommate. I'm surprised by the pain to be honest, if I'm not up and about I'm really quite comfortable if not for the er, well severe (medically worrying constipation), I'd be quite content. I thank my surgeon so much for his expertise and the techniques he says he uses to minimize the pain the patient feels after the ordeal. On my first week appointment with him my JP drains on three of my sites had discharge low enough for a removal, and I was ordered to get milk of magnesia and if that does not work, magnesium citrate for the constipation, they seemed worried about that (Thankfully MoM got stuff flowing again). I wanted to try out ibphrophin, and that actually seems to be doing the job instead of my hydro's and tramadol. After just one week of recovery, I feel like I might actually be able to make it through a day at my desk IT job!\n\nI still feel like I am pulling my skin tight when I stand up straight, like I am wearing a bodysuit a size too small for me. But it'll stretch in time. Pain is there yes, but it's something I'm fighting through. And my compression binder is helping out. From what I understand, the scars themselves will be ugly and weak for up to six weeks, and the swelling and final body shape might take up to four-six moths to come together. But it made me cry. Finally, I am seeing a body of a person who I feel like was on the inside, and not some costume on the outside. There is a long way to go, and this does not mean I'm done, this journey is life long. But for now, it's a bit check in the win column.\n\nI'd love to answer questions people might have about this whole process! It's a side of the story that not all choose to take, but those that do don't seem to see much support for.\n\nPhotos: https://imgur.com/a/CBOk0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7rxum3/250lbs_lost_with_keto_one_week_post_skin_surgery/", "created_utc": 1516543638.0, "score": 4248, "author": "Tiverty", "num_comments": 397, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/7rxum3/250lbs_lost_with_keto_one_week_post_skin_surgery/", "html_title": ""}

Went through a traumatic experience when I was 17 and afterwards the weight just seemed to add on over the years. I'd always been a big guy but it got really bad. Decided to start the keto diet after looking into healthier lifestyles and fast forward two years later (with intermittent fasting and gym training) I had lost 260 pounds. I kept under 1200 calories a day and the best feeling was not constantly being hungry. The last year has been more of a maintenance but with keto cycling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm at 240 now and actually weigh less than I did in high school. Have a decent amount of excess skin that skews my actual weight. Thankfully the government of Canada pays for plastic surgery in my case because it could lead to health problems in the future. Surgery is in about 8 or so months and I'm quite excited to start a completely new chapter of my life once it's done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never really planned this out and did the whole progress photo thing but I'll share some photos of me around my worst and some current photos for comparison. 6'3 if it means anything.

I thought that me gorging on 4 burritos and 2 quesadillas every night and then purging after would stop me from gaining any weight. All lies I told myself to try and provide myself happiness. My first 2 years of college I suffered from an eating disorder and gained an astronomical amount of weight (100+ pounds).\n\n*Flash forward to spring 2020*\n\n20 years old on May 18th of 2020, I weighed 527 pounds, and started keto as a joke. When I saw I had lost 20 pounds in a week and a half, I knew this was my shot and I had to take it.\n\nKeto began, started walking a mile a day and now I\u2019m running 6 miles a day and lifting weights, kicked my eating disorder, and now my life has never been better.

I weigh less than I did my senior year of high school! It hasn\u2019t been easy, and I\u2019ve only had one cheat day on Christmas Day to celebrate losing 100 pounds. Needless to say after the carb side effects I won\u2019t be doing that again for a LONG time haha.\n\nI still have a long ways to go, and I\u2019m trying to lose about 70 more pounds by August in order to walk on to my college\u2019s football team.

I was over 400 pounds at the time. I had a hard time doing a lot of very basic things. I got out of breath easily, and I was too big to fit in booths, standard chairs, and closed MRI machines. I became prediabetic and had alarmingly high blood pressure. I was afraid that I wasn't going to live long enough to see my four-year-old twins grow up. I felt hopeless and sank into a deep depression.\n\nAfter some therapy to deal with the depression issues, I decided that I wanted to improve my life, and that meant getting my weight under control. I lurked here for a month or so, reading and re-reading the FAQ, researching keto, and getting inspired by all of the success stories here. So as I hit my first major milestone, I wanted to share my story with you as thanks.\n\nMy blood sugar, A1C, and blood pressure are now all back within normal ranges. I look better and feel healthier than I have in years. I can play outside with my kids! I still have a ways to go for my goal weight, but life is already so much better than I ever imagined it could be again.\n\nIf you're thinking of giving keto a try, go for it. Your health is worth fighting for.

{"title": "May 2019 went to the emergency room and was told I weighed 350 lbs. It sucked. Last summer I hated myself. Today, June 2nd, makes 9 months since I began Keto, and I weigh 250 lbs.", "selftext": "I've posted on here before about my progress, but I'll retread my history and context. I've grown up big. I've been a fat guy my whole life. I've dealt with it, been depressed about it, and cried about it. I'm a 29 year old man, and I've cried because of being fat. I've tried to lose weight many times in the past, unsuccessfully. I went to the hospital last May, and I wasn't really weighing myself because I knew the grim reality. Mentally, I had accepted I was huge and I'd probably be dead before I reached 60 as my family's genes are known for heart issues. The nurse told me I had **weighed 350 lbs**. *Yikes.* As the summer went on, I realized how lonely I was. I saw someone I looked up to lose some weight and it really inspired me to TRY to lose weight (shouts out to Rocco from Mega64 for that one). I tried to get out more but I just was never happy. And then I started to exercise a little and saw no change. Then WoW Classic came out and I wasn't leaving my room and eating Zebra Cakes all day. I was watching a streamer who began to talk about their experience with weight loss and they truly motivated me to get to work and change my damn life around (shouts out to GreekGodX). \n\nSo on Sept 2nd, 2019, I got rid of the Zebra Cakes. I dumped out the carb-filled drinks. I began anew. I had some bumps in the road to start, and realized I was eating WAY more strict than I had to, counting TOTAL CARBS instead of net carbs. But the ball was rolling. I learned a lot and lost quite a bit in a small amount of time. My coworkers were constantly telling me I had looked great. But I wasn't seeing it myself. I don't know what it is about the human brain, but I can't see it when I look in a mirror. It's like a phantom that haunts me, I can't unsee myself as huge. I was wearing 4XL shirts and now I'm wearing a XL shirt. From size 52 waist jeans to 40 waist jeans. But I can't see it still. I have a jawline now. But unless I see a photo side by side, it's almost like it doesn't matter. It's the worst feeling. But I know I'm succeeding. **I now weigh 250 lbs.** I have been stagnant for about four weeks total now, despite meeting my macros. But, that comes with the territory. I'm still very pleased with my progress. I can RUN again. I go for jogs sometimes now! \n\n---\n\nProgress Photos:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ExUZmpU.jpg\n\n\nOn the left, was May 2019 at 350 lbs. On the right, was March 2020 at around 270 lbs. I currently don't have a better one at 250 lbs, but this was one of the first photos where I truly saw change, so I'm sticking with it here. Coronaszn has made it so I haven't really had much interaction with others, so no opportunities to take a photo! \n\nFor anyone thinking about starting keto, do it. I loved pizza more than anything, but fat head dough and chicken crust pizza have been saviors. There are so many delicious things (and I don't even mean just vegetables, despite loving asparagus now) you can have! 250 lbs, or 100 pounds lost, in 12 months was my original goal but here I am 3 months ahead of schedule. Now I'm aiming for 200 lbs by January. I hope to make it! \n\nI've had two really eye opening, revealing moments that got me emotional: \n\n1. I take an annual photo at a gaming convention with my friends, and with a group I follow online. These were my first \"comparison\" photos to last year. It wasn't until I saw these photos side by side with last year's photos that I could see a drastic change. I told my friends how incredible it felt to me, but I don't know that it was understood. People may think I'm exaggerating when I say I can't see the difference, but when I saw the photo...I had such joy I cried in the bathroom for a bit. I felt so accomplished finally...\n\n2. I've been wearing 4XL shirts forever. They've gotten really loose on me so I started wearing my 3XL shirts from back in the day...and then I bought a single 2XL shirt and it fit pretty well. That felt nice! And then, there was this T-Shirt I REALLY wanted, but was only available in an XL size. I took a chance, thinking, at least maybe in 6 more months it would fit. It arrived, and damn it, it fit well. It's a little SNUG but it FITS. I haven't worn an XL ANYTHING since I was in 6th grade. This felt AMAZING. But now it's time to start replacing my wardrobe and make my pockets hurt. \n\nI hope if nothing else, perhaps someone can get some inspiration or motivation from this. Keto will help.

{"title": "Tips for Super Fat People (Like ME!) Just Starting Out", "selftext": "I wanted to write something specifically to those of us who have 100, 200, or even 300 pounds to lose, from somebody who has been there. These are things I would like to have read 75 pounds ago when I started out at 415. If these offend anyone, my bad. Feel free to add your own two cents.\n\n1. **Everything you know about food is wrong.** I'm a reasonably intelligent, educated professional person, but I didn't know shit about food and nutrition. I thought I was eating \"healthy\" this whole time because I would get \"organic\" chips or I would eat sweet potato fries. Unfortunately, there are a lot of corporations out there that benefit from misinformation, and lots of food being touted as healthy that isn't. RESEARCH keto, HFLC, insulin, IF. YouTube, Keto subreddit, books... Google that shit, because most of what you know is wrong, or we wouldn't be this size. You're not stupid, you're mis-informed and you've been fed a lifetime of bullshit by a lot of bullshitters.\n\n2. **You're exhausted. Push past it.** Being super fat is exhausting. You have no energy. It hurts to put on shoes and go to the store, muchless walking around reading labels. START eating right and the energy will come. When I was 415 pounds, literally even walking *killed* my lower back. It was SO much easier to get starchy, carb-filled take-out with a pint of ice cream and check out after work. Because again, you're exhausted. Don't do that. Start eating right and the energy will come, and it will come faster than you expect it to. But seriously, just fucking start. Most people who have lost a shit-ton of weight wish they'd started earlier. The literal earliest point you can start is now. Don't wait for a health scare. Don't wait to get the energy. Don't wait until your first triple bypass to finally get the motivation. The motivation will come when you're eating HFLC and the scale is going down. That shit is super fucking motivating.\n\n3. **You will not notice body changes for a long fucking time.** I'm down 75 pounds, I still have a LONG way to go, and I'm BARELY noticing changes. All my clothes were stretchy (because I was a fucking 5x) so yes, my clothes are baggier than they were, but I'm still wearing my 415-pound clothing. Because it's all leggings and verrrryyy stretchy material. Learn to appreciate the non-\"noticeable\" NSVs, like \"my back hurts less\" or \"I can walk longer distances\". Don't get discouraged if nobody notices for a while because, and I hate to say this, skinnier people spend a lot of time trying to not comment on or notice fat peoples' weight. They may feel like they're offending you by pointing it out, or they genuinely can't/don't notice a difference.\n\nA skinny person can lose 30 pounds and it will be DRASTIC. If you're over 300 and you lose 30 pounds, you might not even be able to tell. Keep going. Keep fucking going. \n\n4. **The biggest battle you'll face is against hunger.** At my heaviest, I *lived* to eat. I'd eat everything I could, and I'd still always be hungry. Because of how our bodies store fat, I've heard it described something like this: \"Obese people are surrounded by layers of fat, but they're nutritionally starving inside.\" Really the *only* solution I've *ever* found is keto. Before I did keto 100% I would try and up my fat intake to stay full longer, but if you're eating extra fat and still eating a shit ton of carbs, that's not gonna work. Get rid of the fucking carbs (except for vegetables, veggies are dope).\n\n5. **Your friends will sabotage you.** Look, you're the fat friend. You're the friend your friends call when they want ice cream, pizza, cake, and they don't want to feel guilty about it because you're fatter than they are. It's shitty, but it's happened to me. Misery loves company, and the people around you will doubt/question/criticize or flat-out berate your lifestyle change. Find new friends or get real fucking good at setting good boundaries.\n\n6. **TRACK YOUR MACROS** When I wasn't tracking my macros, I was genuinely confused about how I was so heavy. It seemed to defy physics. I would eat fruits and vegetables, and it didn't *feel* like I should be as heavy as I was until I started tracking my macros. Fuck, I was eating a lot of food. Like, a lot. A pastry with coffee. Coffee with loads of sugar. Free food. Drive-ins. So, so many calories (thousands!!!) came from source I didn't even CONSIDER until I stopped eating shitty food. If you think you can eye-ball your keto journey and \"guess\" about keeping your carbs under 20 g, congrats, you're wrong. \n\nOne of the things I realized was that I was eating way way too much food to counter-balance the constant fatigue I felt, which actually turned out to be crazy blood sugar spikes from, ironically, all that food. It's such a vicious cycle.\n\n7. **Stop eating out** Just stop. Restaurants and fast food joints have zero stake in your health. In fact, they benefit greatly from your dependence on them and your repeat business. Cook your own food. It sucks, it's a learning curve, but you'll save all the money and you'll *actually* see results, instead of eating fast food \"low carb\" and still ingesting 3,000+ calories a day. Keto doesn't really work if you're still eating giant, giant meals that just happen to be the *right* food. Keto is great, but it's not going to replace actual physics. Trust me, I tried living on blocks of cheese every day at first. \n\n8. **Figure out what works for you, and fuck the rest.** My well-meaning friends are full of advice that seems good in theory, but absolutely doesn't work for me. I've gotten good at saying, \"thanks for the advice!\" and then just doing whatever the fuck I was already doing. My advice now comes from this subreddit, YouTube videos from doctors and nutrition experts, and science-based articles and books that genuinely know how the body works, NOT from my dear, sweet older co-worker who insists that fruit is the key to true weight loss. \n\nPlease feel free to add your own! I'm always looking for more advice from big people who've been there! KCKO!\n\nEDIT: OMG I walked away from my phone for a few hours and came back to so many awesome messages, comments, and gold bits! Thank you so much!

I\u2019m so happy to be finally reaping the full benefits of my hard work and dedication. \nMany details a lot of people never even think about: For the very first time in my life I have a waist and hips!!! Also, I now have a lap. My twin niece&nephew were able to climb into my lap comfortably together on Christmas. I don\u2019t have to worry about my stomach making weird skin slapping noises when I move or exercise. No more wearing deodorant under my belly.  \nWarning!!! NSFW details: When reaching between my legs you feel fun bits instead of just belly. And...I feel cute in panties! A seemingly small detail of femininity I was never privy to which is really a huge challenge (now addition) to self-confidence. \n\nA literal and metaphorical weight was lifted off me. I feel like I have a second chance at being the healthy and happy person I\u2019ve always wanted to be. \n\nSurgery details: My surgeon removed 10lbs of excess skin from abdomen. He did not need to tighten my abdominal muscles. And he did not do any liposuction. Both were \u201cpossibly needed\u201d pre-surgery but deemed unnecessary once in. It was a 2 hour outpatient procedure.  I had 2 drains afterwards. One removed after 6 days, the other removed after 20 days. I had a novocaine pump in me for the first week.  \n\nFor those curious about the recovery:\nI went to hell and came back. The pain was surprising honestly. I was under the impression I would feel most pain around the incisions. Boy was I wrong. Incisions are numb. Even still, lots of numbness along there as my nerves are reattaching themselves. The pain was the shocking feeling of tendons and fascia stretching, tugging, and pulling across my abdomen. After the initial surgery drugs wore off, I couldn\u2019t stand up straight for almost 2 weeks. It was hell. At the time I said to everyone I wouldn\u2019t recommend this surgery to anyone who does not need it drastically. It\u2019s very painful and debilitating. You will not be able to work for at least 2 weeks. And after that it will be challenging and often painful for 2 more weeks or more. And that\u2019s coming from a healthy 27 year old who healed fast. \nOn the other side of recovery, im ECSTATIC with my results.

{"title": "As of this morning I've lost 101 lbs in 8 months!", "selftext": "**Edit/update a couple of months later for those that stumble on this post: Since making this post I have completely cut out my pudding treats at night, and most sugar alcohols, because they were causing cravings. I've also started to add vegetables into my diet via sauteed spinach, drenched in butter and salt. It's delicious and I love eating it. I also started taking multivitamins.**\n\nFirst, [the photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/1n4cfhS), because that's what we all care about the most! (There are 3 images in the gallery.)\n\nSo, I was *not* expecting to reach this milestone this morning! I was still a couple of pounds away when I weighed in 2 days ago, so I figured I still had another couple of days to go. Coincidentally today is my 8 month keto anniversary! \n\nI started at 375 on Feb 26, and this morning the scale read 274!\n\n**My story**\n\nI have struggled with my weight for around 2 decades at this point. I've tried so many different ways to lose weight, but ultimately I had difficulty sticking to anything I tried. Much of this has to do with my ADHD -- I get excited about new things and can stick to them for short periods of time, but as soon as the newness wears off, or I get bored, I'm back to my old habits. \n\nThe only time I had success was in 2003 when I started Atkins. It seemed to really work with my body and the weight melted off. I lost 52 lbs that go around. I eventually fell out of doing Atkins because I allowed myself to fall into the low carb product craze. I would eat a ton of low carb ice cream or candy and the cravings for sweet things would come rushing back. Eventually I found myself saying, \"I can have a little bit of real ice cream\" and then would finish off the tub. \n\nOver the next 14 years my weight [continued to climb](https://i.imgur.com/q2XzJLH.png). I had mild success, but would always gain the weight back, and then it would keep going up. \n\nEventually I hit a point emotionally and mentally that I was done being fat. I mean, I had hit this point many times, but it was different this time. I didn't want to die prematurely and leave my two young kids without a father. I was tired of waking up with my back in pain. I was tired of being unattractive (I had also gotten divorced about a year and a half before starting keto).\n\nSo, I started keto, and that was the day my life changed forever. \n\nFor some reason I was able to stick to it this time. It was easy. I love the food I eat, and I no longer crave sugar and carbs. I can turn down cookies and ice cream and candy with ease. For me, Keto was the answer. \n\n**How did I do it?**\n\nConsistency, mostly. \n\n*Carbs* - I eat 20 grams of net carbs or less most days. The days I go over it is never more than 60 net grams, and I always get back on track the next day. \n    \n*Tracking* - I track every single thing I eat. And I do it immediately after eating it, otherwise I'll forget about it and forget to track it. I've tracked 227 days in a row at this point. (Early on there were 4 days in a row where I didn't track right away, and eventually forgot what I had eaten those days, which is why my streak isn't a long as I've been doing keto.)\n    \n*Water* - I drink a ton of water, and I use Mio water enhancers to make it palatable. This helps keep me full when I'm in between meals. And keeps my hydrated. \n    \n*Gum* - I chew a ton of sugar free gum. This helps when I'm craving something to chew on but am not hungry. \n    \n*Simplicity* - I eat pretty much the exact same meals every single day. This makes it easy for me. Yeah, I could use more variety, but I enjoy what I eat, so it's not so bad. And I do add some variety on occasion, when I can afford a steak or when I have the time and motivation to make something more complicated. \n    \n*Cravings* - I try to stay away from sweet things. I still indulge in sweet treats like sugar free Jello, as well as sugar free pudding, but if I eat these too often the cravings come on strong, and I go overboard -- especially on the pudding, since it has carbs. Now, I try to stay away from the pudding, because I know it's hard for me to eat just one. \n    \n*Calories* - I keep my calories within a reasonable range. I know this one is a tad controversial here, since the idea is that with keto and high fat you naturally don't eat as much, so you shouldn't need to track your calories. That's how I did it for the first half, but I decided I wanted to speed up the process a little, and started keeping my calories below 2000 per day, on average over a week. Eventually I started lowering this number, and now I'm pretty consistently below 1800 per day on average. \n\n*Fat* - I try to eat at least 60% of my calories in fat. This keeps me more full throughout the day.\n    \n**What do I eat?**\n\nI've found that sticking to the same meals every day is the easiest way for me to be successful. This is what a typical day looks like for me.\n\n*Breakfast:*\n- 8 strips of bacon\n- 1 premiere chocolate protein shake\n- mixed with 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk\n\n*Lunch:*\n- 1 quarter lb hamburger patty from Costco\n- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt\n- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce\n\n*Dinner:*\n- 1.5 quarter lb hamburger patties from Costco\n- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt\n- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce\n- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk\n\n*Snacks:*\n- 2 polly-o string cheese\n- 2 cups sugar free jello\n- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk\n\nI hope this was helpful for those of you just starting out, or those of you finding yourself in need of some extra motivation!\n\n**And as always, KCKO**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9rnjj1/as_of_this_morning_ive_lost_101_lbs_in_8_months/", "created_utc": 1540580143.0, "score": 3359, "author": "filmgeekvt", "num_comments": 184, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9rnjj1/as_of_this_morning_ive_lost_101_lbs_in_8_months/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Here's a detailed list of keto-friendly foods I eat on a regular basis with pics, tips and recipes [Pics, FP]", "selftext": "Full Disclosure:\n\n* I don\u2019t have extravagant or complicated cooking sessions.\n* I keep things as simple as possible to help save me time so the things I eat daily are not complicated.\n* I\u2019m also not a picky eater at all and enjoy the taste of everything.\n\n#1. An ~~apple~~ avocado a day keeps the doctor away\n\n* I used to avoid avocados because of their high fat content, but now I often eat one avocado a day, usually as the first thing to break my fast (\u201cbreakfast\u201d) and it\u2019s shockingly filling. They are quite literally, the perfect low carb, keto-friendly food. They have very few net carbs, lots of fiber, and it\u2019s mostly just fat. Not just any fat though, it has a magnificent fat profile of mostly monounsaturated fats. (This is the stuff olive oil has a lot of too.)\n\n* I eat avocados with some...\n * [Salt & Pepper \\(pictured here\\)](http://i.imgur.com/Ewk66FF.jpg) or\n * Soy Sauce or\n * Lemon Pepper\n\n**How to buy and rotate avocados so you always have some ripe ones:**\n\n* I buy 6-8 avocados at a time because it takes several days for them to ripen and I like to have a good supply.\n* An easy way to check if they\u2019re ripe without having to smash the skin is to simply push down on the brown stem (if there is one). If it goes down, it\u2019s ready.\n* If too many avocados are ripening and you want to slow down the process, throw them in the fridge! As simple as that.\n* With that trick in mind, I usually have 5-10 avocados in the fridge and 5-10 over the counter so that I have a constant supply.\n\n**If you have too many avocados that have ripened, make guacamole! Guamacole is super easy to make!**\n\n* Mash up all the ripe avocados together\n* Add some lime\n* Add some minced up cilantro and you\u2019re good to go!\n* If you\u2019re at a (mexican) restaurant and they serve chips and guacamole, tell them you don\u2019t want the chips, but order some chicken or steak with it and dip it into the guac! Delicious.\n\n#2. Eggs\n\nNormally I eat 2-3 eggs, a few times a week. They too, like avocados, are a very keto-friendly food. They have zero carbs and are highly nutritious with an excellent amino acid (protein) profile.\n\n[Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/VsZZOxX.jpg) are some fluffy hard boiled eggs with some salt and pepper. Simple and delicious. If I\u2019m boiling eggs for the day, I will boil some extra ones at the same time to keep for egg salad (recipe below).\n\n**Other keto friendly ways I prepare eggs?**\n\n* Scrambled or sunny side up, fried with coconut oil.\n* Omelette with cheese/veggies\n* Poached eggs (w/ Hollandaise sauce) (Basically \u201ceggs benedict\u201d without the English muffins.)\n* Egg salad (below!)\n\n#3. Egg Salad\n\nThis makes for a nice lunch idea that\u2019s easy to customize and takes barely a few minutes to make because you just mash the ingredients together.\n\n* [Before (Just soft boiled eggs and avocado)](http://i.imgur.com/ujs445F.jpg)\n* [After \\(mash up eggs, avocado and mayonnaise\\)](http://i.imgur.com/fOPn4Th.jpg)\n\n**Recipe: Mash up all these ingredients together:**\n\n* 1 Avocado\n* 2 Soft-Boiled Eggs (hard boiled works too but soft is creamier)\n* 1 tablespoon mayonnaise\n* Optional: add garlic salt and pepper\n* Optional: add some shredded Cheddar Cheese\n* Optional: add cayenne to taste for spicyness\n\n#4. Simply Delicious Vegetables\n\nThe following are common, non-starchy vegetables that I eat regularly:\n\n* [Asparagus & Brussels Sprouts](http://i.imgur.com/xsMIkd6.jpg)\n* [Broccoli & Cauliflower](http://i.imgur.com/kyR51l4.jpg)\n\n**How do I prepare these guys? Easy! I bake them!**\n\nDon\u2019t be scared of ovens, people, it\u2019s stupid-easy to bake things! Just follow the simple steps below:\n\n* Preheat the oven to 400F.\n* In a small bowl, mix a few tablespoons of **Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Soy Sauce together.**\n* Optional: add some minced garlic, maybe some ginger depending on the veggies used.\n* Put the veggies in a big bowl and pour this small bowl of oil and soy sauce into the veggies and mix it well.\n* Put the veggies on a pan with Parchment Paper for 400F for 15 minutes.\n* And that\u2019s it! Ta-daaaa! See how easy it was?\n* I personally like the EVOO and Soy Sauce, but you could also just put it all with BUTTER, too. That\u2019s keto friendly, too. Oftentimes the veggies are actually there to act as a carrier for the butter.\n\n#5. Blueberries! The Keto-Candy.\n\n[Frozen blueberries are my favorite little snack!](http://i.imgur.com/GTbRzYg.jpg) I love the crunch they provide and since they\u2019re so cold, I can\u2019t eat a bunch of them because then I\u2019ll get brain freeze. This also reminds me to treat berries like candy, so I eat them sparingly and usually NOT daily. When they\u2019re on sale, I stock up on a bunch of them, wash them and keep them in the freezer. (I eat raspberries and strawberries sometimes too, but blueberries are my jam, without the jam.)\n\n#6. Baked Fish\n\nFish is something I have ~3x a week that I\u2019m always trying to eat more of. On the days that I don\u2019t eat fish, I take a fish oil capsule to get more Omega 3\u2019s in my diet.\n\n* [This was a fillet of Alaskan Salmon surrounded by potatoes for the non-keto guests.](http://i.imgur.com/R686JDM.jpg) :)\n* [I was at a friends and I suggested we bake some fish \\(tilapia\\), brussels sprouts and mushrooms and they didn\u2019t even know we were eating a totally keto-friendly meal!](http://i.imgur.com/UmZV8cJ.jpg)\n\n**Here\u2019s how I bake fish (you could do this to fillets or whole fish):**\n\n* Preheat the oven to 375F\n* Rub salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon and blackened fish seasoning on both sides of the fish.\n* Bake at 375F for 25-35 minutes.\n* Done! How easy is that!\n\n**Other fish choices:** I don\u2019t eat tuna anymore because Wild Sardines in Olive Oil and Smoked Sprats are superior in every way. They are lower on the food chain than tuna and don\u2019t accumulate toxins (such as mercury) and have a superior Omega 3 to 6 ratio! (Btw, I used to buy Riga Sprats but turns out they are stored in rapeseed oil, which is a terrible vegetable oil to eat, not only cause rape is bad, but it\u2019s mostly bad fats\u2026 so no more of that brand!)\n\n#7. Salmon and Cream Cheese (And Avocado!?)\n\n* [In this photo I put salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onions and some aleppo pepper on a big piece of lettuce to make a dank meal.](http://i.imgur.com/jH2zTVF.jpg) \n* Normally people eat the above ingredients sandwiched between a bagel. But you can\u2019t have a bagel on a keto diet. Bagels are just bread. Fuck bread. Why would I want that stuff getting in the way of the deliciousness in the middle?\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Smoked Salmon Lox\n* Cream Cheese\n* Salt and Pepper to taste\n* Optional: Chopped Green Onions (Scallions)\n* Optional: Capers\n* Optional: Avocado\n* Optional: If you want a \u201ccarrier\u201d, you could put it all on a piece of lettuce.\n\n#8. Cheese and Olives\n\nI\u2019ve been eating [this Kerrygold Dubliner Irish cheese](http://i.imgur.com/p4De4mo.jpg) as a standalone snack. I love to get a big knife and make extremely thin slices of these. The taste is so complex and satisfying. (They are available on Costco. And speaking of Kerrygold brand, by the way, their Irish butter tastes really good too. All their products come from grass-fed cows.)\n\nI may or may not eat this cheese with some olives. Olives have almost no net carbs and have a great fat profile, so they are a great little keto-friendly snack. I love the ones in brine.\n\n#9. Cream Cheese and Bastirma (seasoned, air-dried cured beef)\n\nOne of my favorite dairy things is to get [cream cheese and mix it with some Armenian cured deli meat called Bastirma.](http://i.imgur.com/PRGjonz.jpg) This is one of those foods that are not well known if you\u2019re not familiar with the culture, but it\u2019s highly spiced, the slices are extremely thin and delicious with some cream cheese.\n\n**Here are some other Middle Eastern Foods that are keto friendly:**\n\nSince my father is Lebanese-Armenian and my mother is Armenian-Armenian, I know about some foods that others may not know about that are very low carb and these are my random faves:\n\n* [Lebni / Labneh \\(Strained yogurt\\)](http://i.imgur.com/CHfi64w.jpg)\n * This is a type of kefir cheese, made in a similar process as Greek Yogurt, but it tastes much more tart, like sour cream. Traditionally it\u2019s spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and topped with some dried mint.  I personally think it\u2019s dank as fuck.\n* [Sujuk / Soujoukh / Yershik](http://i.imgur.com/kTZKT95.png)\n * This is type of highly spiced, dried beef sausage that you could find at your local international market as well, probably in the deli section. I love to eat them with cream cheese.\n\n**Note:** One of the main drawbacks of deli meat, or highly processed meats is that their protein becomes inferior and a lot of important minerals (like potassium and magnesium) are lost as well, so I don\u2019t make them my main source of protein.\n\n#10. Nuts: Macadamia\u2019s and Almonds\n\n* As you know, when one is on a low carb diet, they should replace those calories with fat and nuts are predominantly high in fat. The top two nuts that are very low in carbs AND have a very healthy fat profile are macadamia\u2019s and almonds!\n\n* [Macadamia Nuts that are Dry Roasted with Sea Salt](http://i.imgur.com/BQSWxxn.jpg) are one of my favorite snacks. They taste like butter balls that are perfectly salted. (~20cals each)\n* I *love* [these Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds.](http://i.imgur.com/5R4Huha.jpg) I always get a pound of these that last me the month.\n* [These Marcona Almonds with Rosemary](http://i.imgur.com/fOgGA9G.jpg) are a bit pricey, but have an incredibly luxurious taste. Marcona almonds are fried in olive oil, by the way.\n\n* **Warning for those trying to lose weight:** Nuts are high in calories and it\u2019s easy to \u201caccidentally\u201d eat a few hundred calories of these if you are just munching mindlessly. Even if you practice severe carbohydrate restriction, eating more calories than you need can result in fat gain. (I still use MyFitnessPal when I want to ensure weight loss even on keto, but that's just me, YMMV)\n\nYou could have other nuts too, like cashews and peanuts for example. But as dank as they are, I can\u2019t go to town on them cause they\u2019re somewhat higher in net carbs, so I eat them very sparingly and infrequently. If I\u2019m going to have peanuts, I usually opt for peanut butter, actually. And on occasion, I go for cashew butter. [\\(relevant peanut butter related meme\\)](http://i.imgur.com/GZO0Hfu.jpg)\n\n#11. Milk Alternatives for when I want a creamy drink\n\n**[Unsweetened flax, coconut, soy, hemp, cashew, almond milks.](http://i.imgur.com/FajoKSy.jpg) (We live in good times to have access to such variety!)**\n\n* Note that ALL of these must specifically say **\u201cUNSWEETENED\u201d** on their label. The beauty of these are that they are only 30-45 calories per cup.\n\n* **Coconut Milk:** In the summertime, there\u2019s something so brisk and refreshing about coconut milk. (It reminds me of summer, probably thanks to all those dark tanning products that smelled like coconut oil.)\n* **Hemp and Flax and Cashew milks:** I have only tried these a couple times, they are a bit more fatty, creamy, thick and I like them.\n* **Almond milk** is my favorite. Some people don\u2019t like it at all and that bewilders me, but\u2026 I like it and it\u2019s a yummy drink to me. I sometimes will heat up a cup and drink it *hot.*\n* **Soy Milk** is my go to when I\u2019m looking for a more hearty drink (clocking in at 100cals/cup), I really like unsweetened soy milk. It\u2019s also great to add to your tea so it\u2019s like a chai-latte. Protip: If you live near some Asian stores, you can find unfiltered soy milk which tastes like the real thing. But you must make sure it\u2019s not sweetened.\n\n#12. Arugula Salad\n\n[This is stupid easy to make.](http://i.imgur.com/GdU98Eg.jpg) I just added arugula and avocado and salt & pepper and olive oil. How easy is that? Really easy.  You could also do something similar with spinach. Loves me some spinach.\n\n#13. Keto-Friendly Foods On The Go\n\nIf I\u2019m on the go, I usually don\u2019t have hunger and can get away with several hours without eating but\u2026 if I do...\n\n* I like Quest Bars, specifically the Choc Chip Cookie Dough flavor. They are the only truly keto-friendly bars that I know of. (Edit: Costco carries Kirkland Protein Bars that are similar to these apparently and much cheaper!)\n* Sunflower seeds (I love the cracked pepper version) found at most gas stations, are quite a good snack if you like spitting sunflower shells.\n* If you\u2019re not a fan of spitting sunflower shells, already-shelled-for-you roasted and salted sunflower seeds/kernels are also pretty delicious too. These also are found at gas stations. Just make sure they don\u2019t have added sugar.\n\n**I also take an avocado with me sometimes. Here\u2019s how to eat a ripe avocado without any tools:**\n\n* Bite the skin at the top to remove it and spit it out.\n* Squeeze the avocado out from the bottom up. Eat it as it comes out the top hole.\n* Eventually the seed will come out as well and you just keep squeezing it out into your mouth and into the trash or straight into the trash.\n* **Fair warning:** Keep the avocado in a place that won\u2019t get mashed in your bag by other things or else it will make a mess. Ask me how I know. :P (Maybe even put it in its own zip lock bag or something)\n\n#14. Mineral Management and Daily Supplements\n\nMineral management is especially important on a ketogenic diet to prevent feeling fatigue (especially before strength or endurance training) or if you\u2019re not feeling well while in ketosis. These are the following things I take:\n\n* **Multivitamin:** I supplement with a daily one-a-day multivitamin to cover my bases.\n* **Sodium & Potassium:** It\u2019s no coincidence that many foods I eat are somewhat higher in sodium overall, and that\u2019s because the kidneys excrete more than usual while in ketosis and so I make up for it with the higher sodium intake. But, to not get too much sodium, I use \u201cLoSalt\u201d instead of regular salt because it\u2019s more potassium in it and half the sodium (salt) which makes for a better balance. I also drink bone broth almost daily.\n* **Magnesium:** Two of [these magnesium pills a day](https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Absorption-Magnesium-Elemental-240-Count/dp/B000BD0RT0/) (400mg) for 20 days will help stabilize magnesium levels. This improves almost every cellular process in your body (especially important for sleep and muscle cramps). This is doubly important on keto due to the kidneys excreting faster than usual.\n* **Fish Oil:** If I did not eat fish that day, I\u2019ll take 1-2 capsules of fish oil which has lots of omega 3\u2019s in each capsule. \n * **Advisory:** Many fish oil brands will say \u201c1200mg\u201d but really, only 300mg of it will only be Omega 3 fatty acids. So read the labels to make sure you're getting one with high DHA/EPA!\n* **Protein:** If I haven\u2019t ate much protein or I had a particularly hard strength training day, I will drink a scoop of [vegan protein powder](https://truenutrition.com/p-1169-vegan-protein-optimizer-formula-1lb.aspx) and add raw cacao and chia seeds in a blender bottle. The unflavored one tastes really blah but the chocolate or french vanilla flavored ones are a good powder that gets the job done with minimal fuss.\n\n#15. Special mention for Fiber\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling like I ate too many things that don\u2019t have any fiber (read: meat, cheese, etc) and feel constipated, then I will have 1-2 teaspoons of organic psyllium husk mixed in water. It\u2019s pure fiber which causes me to poop gloriously sometime later that day.\n\n**ProTip:** Nowadays, if I\u2019m going traveling or camping, I will take a zip lock bag of this stuff with me and my bowel movements won\u2019t feel disrupted from the traveling and it works incredibly well. ([relevant meme](http://i.imgur.com/OAgPvtS.jpg))\n\n###Well, that wraps it up\n\n* Now you know what I eat on a regular basis. All this info above was from a blog post that I published yesterday titled [\"What I Actually Eat\"](http://antranik.org/what-i-actually-eat/) but since self promotion is not allowed on this sub, I took the hour here to make it reddit-friendly.\n* If you're missing an ingredient or curious to know exactly which product I use, there are a billion links (mostly on Amazon) in the official article.\n* If you like my writing style, here's a link to the [beginners guide I created for the keto diet](https://redd.it/4vhrv5) that was very well received.

Originally my goals were to lose >30 pounds by the end of 2017 and >50 by my birthday. Beat both of those goals by about 50 pounds. I did it with keto, intermittent fasting, and extended water fasting (longest I\u2019ve gone is a week). It\u2019s not been super easy, and man I\u2019ve had some real bad setbacks (2 of which were >10 pounds gained), but I\u2019ve just about made it to my goal. Once I get under 200 I plan on hitting the gym hard and putting some carbs in my diet (and a lot of protein) to gain muscle quick. Do that for 5ish months, then shred the rest of the year with keto. I might post again on New Years or something. \nAlso a tip: find close friends who can keep you accountable. One of my best friends has kept track of my progress since I started and boy I couldn\u2019t have done it without him. Find people who really want the best for you. \nIt\u2019s funny... me and my friends had a running joke \u201close the weight for a hot prom date.\u201d Obviously not my only motivation but it gave me something to look forward to. If you asked me then who I\u2019d like to take out of anyone, I would have told you this girl Rachel. Just a few weeks ago me and those friends did a big promposal for Rachel (from me), she says yes, and we\u2019re gonna go on a date after. I don\u2019t think keto has nothing to do with this. Hmmmm. \nBut anyway thanks for reading this, KCKO! I\u2019ll respond to all the comments as soon as I can, but today is my birthday and I do have a hot date. \nP.S. I know I look like an idiot with my tongue out in the first pic. And in the other one it looks like I have a really pointy nipple. That\u2019s my arm. Also my hair looks bad cuz I ain\u2019t washing it until right before I pick Rachel up. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m not gonna just pig out on crap when I hit my goal. I\u2019m talking like a cup of brown rice or sweet potato before and after working out. That\u2019s what most jacked Youtubers say, what my twin brother says (who loves keto and is way more jacked than I), and also what a nutritionist told me who did keto to lose a ton of fat. Also I may or may not follow up with prom pics tomorrow. Maybe if this hits 1000 upvotes I will ;) haha kidding. If I\u2019m feeling it I will. But definitely if it hits 1k.

From 438 lbs to 238 lbs!", "selftext": "[Before And After Picture (438 lbs to 238 lbs)](https://imgur.com/gallery/j75bxFC)\n\nThis week I have weighed in at 238 LBS, which officially puts me at a total loss of exactly 200 pounds! A lot of hard work and dedication has led me to where I am today, and although I\u2019m still not finished my journey (~ 20-30ish pounds to lose) I am truly grateful and proud of what I have been able to accomplish up to this point, and for how much my life has improved as this journey has gone on. \n\nAfter doing Keto and any other diet technique, one thing I have continued to stick with, as mentioned in my [initial update](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app); is IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day) while keeping CICO in mind (Calories In Calories Out). In terms of exercise, I was doing a 5 day ULPPL (Upper Lower Push Pull Legs) Bodybuilding Routine alongside post-lifting cardio, usually HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), on at least 3 of those days. Also, I try to remain active and ideally get some form of cardio in through sports or whatever else I can on my rest days. And this is all done in a fasted state to help burn calories/fat more efficiently and boost metabolism etc. \n\nI have faced plenty of adversity during this journey, though have nonetheless stayed relentless in achieving my goals. The love and support I have received from this community in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) has definitely helped push me to work that much harder and something I will never take for granted. \n\nI really want to set an example for how much power we all have within us, whether it\u2019s related to weight loss or not; we all have the potential to accomplish such great things that often isn\u2019t realized. Whatever it is you desire to accomplish, whether it\u2019s losing/gaining weight or whatever else, please remember how much YOU yourself are capable of, and to never sell yourself short. Realize your potential and realize it is never too late to make a change or better yourself. \n\nI\u2018ve constantly been trying to lose weight practically my whole life, since I was just a child, and the best decision I made was to never give up. Now here I am today, not at the end of my journey, but several steps ahead of where I was when I started and constantly pushing forward. Will be updating you guys again once I reach my final goal weight (~ 20-30ish lbs away), until then wishing the best to each and every one of you in your journeys, stay blessed! \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/cmrd4e/down_200_lbs_in_1_year_naturally_with_diet_and/", "created_utc": 1565102130.0, "score": 3221, "author": "omarthaherfit", "num_comments": 301, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/cmrd4e/down_200_lbs_in_1_year_naturally_with_diet_and/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "A message to super fat lurkers (like me!)", "selftext": "A few years ago I made a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6ntcpg/tips_for_super_fat_people_like_me_just_starting/) of [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6onxem/more_tips_for_super_fat_people_like_me_just/) about keto for those of us with more than a few pounds to lose. I started my journey at 415 pounds. I\u2019ve been asked a few times over the years to write a follow up, but the reality is that I fell off the wagon after losing a shit-ton of weight. I got into a relationship with someone who actively tried to sabotage my health goals, but more than that I didn\u2019t value myself enough to set strong boundaries and take my health seriously (emotionally or physically). I gained a good portion of my weight back, and it was an extremely humbling process. But I\u2019m back! I\u2019m on the keto train, I\u2019m steadily losing weight, I\u2019m working with my doctor, and wanted to share some insight from the experience but also, to speak to those lurkers who are desperate to start but don\u2019t know how, or don\u2019t think they can. In my mind there\u2019s a difference between \u201closing a 50 pounds would be great!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m literally dying at the weight I\u2019m at\u201d and this post is aimed at the latter. \n\n* **First things first, you are not going to find the right time to start.** I hate to tell you, but you will not get a lightning bolt of inspiration. A song/poem/speech/revelation will not come on at just the right exact cosmic moment to start your journey *for* you. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019re waiting for the stars to align and for motivation to strike. But I\u2019m here to tell you, inspiration isn\u2019t tangible or reliable because it\u2019s an emotion, not a habit. For me, I wanted to be in the right situation with the right energy and circumstances and the right support system, but these things are a fallacy. Because your body is working against you. If you\u2019re super fat, you are likely insulin resistant. You are likely experiencing inflammation, aches, poor sleep, low motivation, minimal enjoyment in life. If you\u2019re like I was, food is probably the only thing giving you any sort of enjoyment or relief. When I was 415 pounds, getting to the grocery store was a painful endeavor, how the hell am I going to start a radical new lifestyle?\n* **Which leads me to my next point: just fucking start**. You do NOT need ketone sticks to get started. You do **NOT** need a kitchen full of erythritol, Smart Cakes, and collagen powder. Keto is **NOT** expensive, and it is **NOT** the complicated journey we make it out to be. It\u2019s chicken and vegetables and eggs. It\u2019s olive oil. It\u2019s a few hamburger patties. You do not need to be rich; in fact, I\u2019ve never spent as little on food as I do when I\u2019m eating keto because my fat ass eats the hell out of some fast food when I\u2019m not doing keto, and that shit adds up. Keto isn\u2019t expensive, being fat is. Insulin is. Doctors visits, surgery, chronic illness, those big ass clothes I have to purchase at special Fat Lady stores \u2013 these are expensive things. Chicken thighs? Not expensive.\n* **In fact, I would encourage you, at least in the beginning, to keep it as simple as possible**. When I try and complicate the process with artificial sweeteners, \"acceptable-ish\" fruits, Keto Approved Fast Food, etc. I confuse myself and my results are weaker because I make exceptions and over-indulge. Sure you can introduce some moderate keto sweet treats down the line, but right now you are mentally reprogramming your mind to view food as fuel and not the blood sugar fluctuating Therapist/Best Friend it has been to you for the last X years. Keep it simple, learn to love fucking zucchini, and leave the baked goods for lesser mortals (literally, smaller people). I would encourage you to avoid eating out at all, at least for a while. When you\u2019re attempting to undo years of behaviors and you're sitting squished into that Red Robin booth, deciding to just get the burger and bottomless fries *this once and start again tomorrow* is going to be too tempting. This is coming from a bitch that *never did quite find the bottom* of those damn fries. I recommend avoiding the temptation, at least at first.\n* **Your environment  doesn't have to be perfect.** If you\u2019re anything like me, you want the ideal Healthy Living Lifestyle to get started, because making excuses is infinitely easier than doing the work. I\u2019m so ridiculous that I would tell myself that there\u2019s no point in beginning a healthy eating lifestyle *now* because I\u2019m going on vacation. In two months. I\u2019m a fucking idiot. But more than that, I was scared. I feared the commitment and work and I was terrified that if I actually tried, I could fail and failing made my weight seem more like a death sentence than a temporary state that I could fix\u2026 if I tried. See how vicious that cycle is? But that\u2019s the great thing about keto, is that once you get out of your head and actually start, it gets easier and easier until you wonder how you lived any other way.\n* \u00b7 **The battle is mental, but don\u2019t discount the physical aspect of this journey.** I had a ritual of stopping at Taco Bell after work, every day, and eating about \\~3,000 calories. I was eating because of my stress of the day, but I was also fucking hungry! I deserved it after working so hard, I told myself. I inevitably would kick myself when finally pulled into my duplex driveway, covered in shredded cheese and shame, because I knew that it was another day of failure and weight gained instead of lost. In my mind the battle was extremely mental, **WHICH IT IS!** But there\u2019s also an incredibly insidious physical battle happening, too. When you are super fat, your insulin and hormones are FUCKED. Your body is extremely bad at utilizing the nutrients it receives, so it stores your just-eaten food as fat and you\u2019re constantly hungry but extremely inefficient at, you know, eating. When you start eating LC/keto, your body almost immediately starts correcting the insulin sensitivity, because you\u2019re eating foods that don\u2019t spike your insulin, and it makes you *actually* satiated which is something our big bodies aren\u2019t used to. I could sit across from my skinny friends and watch them pick at their salads or whatever, just positively *fiending* to finish their meals even though I just ate what was probably too many calories anyway. Once my doctor explained insulin resistance, it all made sense. When you\u2019re overweight, you\u2019re not playing a fair game. Trying to lose weight while still eating high carb foods means you\u2019re never going to feel satiated, and constant hunger is such a miserable and defeating way to make lasting change. And even though the battle is stacked against us physically, we still have to do the work. I spent a lot of time angry that it was *so hard* for me to lose weight and my victim mentality kept me stuck. It may not be your *fault* that you are the size that you are, but it is your *responsibility.* Being mad about this will not change the scale, the only thing that will change this is fighting the battle using the best tools we have: science and habits.\n\nSo what can you expect when you follow my advice and **fucking start?** Keto is a very YMMV thing. I can\u2019t tell you 100% how your life will change, but I\u2019ll tell you what happened to my fat ass:\n\n* **My hunger subsided almost immediately.** Within a day or two. Worry less about how many calories you eat and more about the quality of those calories. Eat the living fuck out of some chicken and broccoli. Keep hard-boiled eggs on you like some sort of Poultry Superhero. Be ready to challenge cravings with fat and protein. You're less likely to pull into the Burger King drive through if you are up to your eyeballs in string cheese.\n* **Your energy will skyrocket.** When you\u2019re not subsisting on Door Dash pad thai two times a day (not that I would ever do that!), you\u2019ll find that you have way, way more energy. It\u2019s almost magical. And once you start feeling better, you start getting ***fucking angry*** that you spent so much time and money to feel sluggish as shit for so long. Our bodies were not meant to process so many carbs as often as we have been, and it really just makes your energy fucking tank. I\u2019m to the point in my keto journey that the idea of a Frappuccino (which used to be my shit) actually makes me *feel* lethargic, even thinking about it. The carb crash is real.\n* **Your motivation will beget motivation.** Here\u2019s the thing about motivation: it only really works when it is self-reinforcing. Nobody else\u2019s journey will push you towards change like seeing your own progress. When you can actually walk without pain, you jump out of your chair without groaning, when you actually feel excited about going for walks and meal prepping and playing around with different spices in your cooking, THAT is motivation. If you wait until a chicken thigh *sounds* more appealing than a cookie, you\u2019re never going to get started. \n* **Your sleep will improve, your breathing will become easier, you\u2019ll get fewer headaches.** After a few months on keto, I could start to feel bones that I didn\u2019t know I had, which was both exciting and existentially nauseating (wait, you are telling me I have a fucking *SKELETON*? I am mortal. I am bereft.)\n* **A lot of the aches and pains associated with constant inflammation will clear up within weeks or even days.** Your body will hurt less to operate. I started my journey with constant, chronic pain *in my twenties*. And while I still have some pain (and still have quite a journey to go), it\u2019s exciting to see the progress from \u201cyeah, that knee is just gonna hurt like a bitch forever\u201d to \u201cwow, I can actually stand on that knee for more than 15 minutes without wanting to chop it off and throw it into the sun\u201d.\n* **Other areas in your life will remarkably improve that you didn't expect.** My finances when I was supporting a 415 pound body were a fucking joke. My relationships were hugely suffering because I didn\u2019t want to *see* people when I was out of breath just walking from my car. Nobody wanted to date me. I was depressed, constantly comparing myself to other people on social media, and becoming increasingly angry at how unfair the world felt. When you start the journey to take back ownership of your life, the things that felt so out of reach will start clicking into place. You\u2019ll have the energy to clean your room, the self-esteem to reconnect with old friends, and the confidence to start living your life and not just watch other people live theirs.\n\nI hope this was helpful at all. If you want to talk, share journeys, berate me, or anything feel free to PM me. I believe in keto, and I\u2019m excited to accomplish my goals with this lifestyle.\n\nEdit: wow!!! Thank you for all the amazing responses and holy crap, the golds and silvers and platinums!!! I feel so honored.

{"title": "Discovering my ribcage, saving bacon grease and other lessons from losing 70 pounds this year", "selftext": "Well, on January 1st, I decided to give keto a shot. I started this year as a 6'3\" man weighing *278.8 pounds*. And as of this morning, I'm still a man, still the same height, but now I weigh *206 pounds*. That's pretty neat.\n\nAnd you know what? I'm giving up my fear of posting myself on Reddit. Some of you post in your underwear and that's tremendous. Here's a before and after: https://imgur.com/a/SHnrDnD \n\nThis sub has been a huge inspiration for me (and although I don't comment a lot, I'd say it's instrumental in my success). Here are some things I learned, things that happened, and things I wish would happen.\n\n* **Your weight loss will get noticed around 2-3 months** \u2013 This was the point where people were actually impressed that I lost weight while putting butter in my coffee (and on my burgers and basically anywhere else butter would go). \n* **Take embarrassing before pics** \u2013 I did not and I regret it a ton. Now I can't get a super upvoted post! \n* **Learn how to hide those pics on your phone** \u2013 If you're on an iPhone, go to your camera roll. Hit \"select\" in the upper right hand corner. Select relevant pictures and tap the icon in the bottom left. Select \"Hide\" and they'll all go into a hidden album that won't show up when you hand your phone to your family.\n* **The George Foreman grill is my savior** \u2013 Honestly, I don't know why getting a G.F. grill isn't recommended more on this sub. You eat so much meat. You will have fast access to meat even on nights you don't wanna eat meat. \n* **I actually kinda like clothes now** \u2013 I always said that I bought clothes thinking about comfort over style. And I'd wear the same clothes for years (maybe decades?). But now, I care about what I wear.\n* **Check yourself out more** \u2013 Lost 100 pounds? 50? 5? Doesn't matter. Take a gander at yourself and smile. You did it. Even if it's hard to notice, just give yourself a smile to keep on going. \n* **Don't buy a ton of new clothes at once, though** \u2013 I went from 40\" waist to a 38\" waist and I got a ton of new nice pants. Now I'm a 36\" and Goodwill has a ton of new nice pants. \n* **Being \"large\" is part of our identity. Identities are hard to change.** \u2013 I always thought I was an XL human. Lots of my jokes are about gluttony. And now that I'm an L human, I have to rethink who I am (weird). But it's possible! \n* **Going out to eat still kinda sucks** \u2013 Let's not pretend that it doesn't. Yeah, you can usually get a bunless burger at most places. But if you're going to some chichi eatery and not some chain restaurant, it'll be rough.  \n* **I cheat on vacation** \u2013 If you learn the heuristic, \"when I'm away from home, I eat whatever I want,\" it's fine. Just make sure you don't bring back any tempting sweets with you and go back to your nice, keto-friendly kitchen.\n* **Feeling your ribcage is so god damn weird** \u2013 I still haven't gotten over the fact that I can feel the little ridges. Individual ribs! My chest is a rack of ribs! My shoulder is so pointy. What is this? \n* **It's not losing weight, it's growing your dick** \u2013 Sorry for the gross one. But if you're ever like, \"Should I give up keto?\" Rephrase it as, \"Do I want my dick to shrink?\" \n* **Evangelizing about keto is like being a Jehovah's Witness** \u2013 And no offense to any Witnesses here, but no one wants to be preached at. If people ask, I tell them that I did keto, a brief explanation of what it is, and then I ask: Hey, if you're interested in more, I'm happy to talk with you about it. \n* **Read this sub** \u2013 The reason Weight Watchers does so well is because they've created an amazing community (in person and on WW Connect). It helps so much to hear what other people are going through. Leave a nice comment on a low-effort, well-meaning post. It's nice. \n* **Be nice on this sub** \u2013 Yeah, some people don't read the FAQ and can't Google, but everyone here is tryin' to make their lives better. The world is negative enough these days, let's be a cool force for kindness and health. \n* **I wish I could be part of xxketo** \u2013 Literally the nicest sub in the world. So much insight, perspective, and heart that you'd never experience as a man. Can I please be a part? \n* **When in doubt, electrolytes** \u2013 If you can't put your finger on something and you're just kind of feeling weird, just pound some and it might work.\n* **All my cool band shirts don't fit** \u2013 I've been buying XL shirts since ... maybe I was 12? And all the cool shirts I've collected over the year no longer fit. This sucks.\n* **Save that bacon fat, it's not (that) weird** \u2013 I've got a mason jar that has pig fat in it, you guys. When you're done cooking bacon, wrap a coffee filter around a jar, and pour the grease into it. Then use it instead of butter when cooking something kinda boring and make it extra awesome. \n* **Keto won't fix your life** \u2013 Some people do keto and suddenly have no more illness, they're running 4 minute miles, Swedish models start following them around, and crisp $20 bill shows up in their front pocket every morning. Not me. Yes, keto gave me more energy and I feel a lot better, but it's not a magic bullet. \n* **People are nicer to thinner people** \u2013 It's not right. But it's true. So when you start lookin' your max beautiful, just remember to be nice to larger people. \n* **I sweat a lot less** \u2013 Any folks here hate summer 'cause it turns you into an unpresentable mess the second you step outside? Well, if you keto hard enough for long enough, you'll learn to hate summer a lot less.\n* **I've never made fathead dough** \u2013 It just seems like slightly more work than I want to do. Is it worth it, you guys?\n* **People want to weigh less, they don't want to lose weight** \u2013 People will ask you about your success and will immediately list off the carbs they could never give up. It's fine. You can't save everyone. \n* **KCKO is a stupid phrase, but smart advice** \u2013 Might as well say \"got keto?\" But if you slip up, don't sweat it. Just go eat and egg and you'll be fine. \n* **Find a keto sweet-o that you're into** \u2013 Personally, I mess around with ChocZero products, Fat Snax cookies, and Lily's chocolates. If they don't stall you and they fit your macros, go for it. Sweets are nice.\n* **There is no True Keto** \u2013 Are you losing weight, feeling better, and keeping your carbs low? Then you're doin' keto your way. And that is awesome. \n\nI know that was a long wall of text, but hopefully there was a li'l nugget or tip that will help out some new or even seasoned keto veterans. There's so much overwhelming positivity on this sub, it's just a real pleasure to be a part of it. We're all just trying to be better, happier, healthier humans. Even if we have nothing else in common, we're all dedicated to taking what we've got and turning it into something amazing.

Damn chin and jawline pimples!! \n\n\nI started out making all sorts of treats and fat bombs and such but it was so much work, and my boyfriend would eat them all up so fast. \nI\u2019ve slowly drifted off and now only make them for special occasions. \n\nSnack - wise I eat sugar free jello almost daily and smart sweets gummy bears occasionally. \nI don\u2019t need them, but if temptations are running high- I like to indulge. \n\nOtherwise my meals are pretty consistent. Meat and veggie! Caesar salad, Broccoli! Cauliflower has so many options as to how to prepare it- and I\u2019m getting a little better in making it. \n\nI haven\u2019t gone to a gym once, however my work as a mailman is pretty physical, so I walk on average 10K 5 days a week. \nThat has helped me to be distracted enough not to boredom eat. \nI don\u2019t eat until I come home from work, which can be around 6-7pm some nights and only eat until about 10pm. Fasting otherwise. \n\nThe worst part is I guess I have body dysmorphia. \nI still look down and see fat me. But the pictures don\u2019t lie, and neither does the scale. \nI swear I think I lost all my weight from the top down- losing from the face and chest in the first couple months and finally my thighs and butt are finally taking some different shapes! \n\n\nHonestly, TAKE THE BEFORE PICTURE!\nIt helps at every step along the way to see how you have progressed. \n\nI have snuck in some \u201ccheats\u201d because that\u2019s life- and I think now I have enough self power to be able to eat one chip, or have one cookie and walk away. (At special occasions) \nI don\u2019t have any chronic issues as some of you might- so take that as you will, you may not be able to do the same. \n\nI think I gained all my weight in the past from boredom eating. Just sitting on the couch watching tv- and needing to eat something. Of course, I never ate anything *good* for me. \n\nI am determined to not gain back this weight, although it may happen at some point down the road- I can\u2019t let that bog me down. \nI am here for the health benefits as well as all the new clothing I\u2019ve had to purchase! \n\nOverall, a life changer. If you\u2019re thinking about starting this diet- just do it. \nIf you keep saying next Monday, just try to start now ! Clean out your pantry! Clean out your fridge if you can- eliminate the temptation. \nIf you slip up- it\u2019s ok- as long as you get right back on after. \n\nCan\u2019t figure out how to change my flair right now- I\u2019m at SW: 220 GW:150 CW: 151 \n\nI have gone from an XL to a S/ M shirt. \n\nPant size 18 to size 8. \n\nKCKO!!!!! \n\n\nEDIT: \n\nThank you everyone for all of your kind words! I never expected anywhere near this response! \n\nI see I\u2019ve inspired some of you to continue with your goals, or start brand new and I\u2019m so so happy to hear it! \nIn my own life I\u2019ve inspired my auntie and brother in law. \n\nWhen I started I never thought I could do it, and here we are only a short time later. \nI ate like complete crap before- basically a 180.

{"title": "I got my Mom and very sick Father to go on keto for 3 months. Blood tests came back for my Dad and he saw HUGE improvements!", "selftext": "My father has been struggling with many illnesses his entire life, and more keep popping up as he ages (only 45). He\u2019s had 3 heart attacks, an 11 rating on his blood sugar, bladder cancer for 4 years, lost his job, ran out of unemployment, the whole nine yards. I\u2019m so proud of him for sticking through it all. Even though he might be grumpy sometimes, he has great reasons to be. \n\nI did keto myself for 6 months with great success. I lost a good 50lbs. I knew what the diet could do if you gave it time. My father got his blood tests (this was 3 months ago) and everything was looking horrible. He was in the worse ranges for all of his illnesses. That\u2019s when I told him straight up \u201cDad, I love you. I want you to live longer and to feel better. I know of a diet that can alleviate some of these things. Let me help.\u201d \n\nObviously I got a big fat no and he dismissed it, but after a week of slightly dropping the idea into conversations, something changed. He realized all the things he was currently missing and wanted to see and do. That\u2019s when he told me that we can do the diet, but only if the whole family does it together.\n\nSo that\u2019s what we did! We made family keto meals for 3 months. My dad got really into pork rinds and guacamole. We started making collagen shakes. We even started stretching and doing light exercises. My dad even got on the exercise bike a few times!\n\nThen my parents went on vacation. There they decided that they will eat well for a month and then pig out at Disney world. Later in their stay, that\u2019s when they got the blood tests results. My mom told me that my dad was scared to death of opening the results. He didn\u2019t want to know he would die. It was too much for him to handle.\n\nThat\u2019s when my mom shared the great news! His blood sugar was looking close to what a normal level would be. His cholesterol was better than what it was before his first heart attack! We really were turning back the clock!\n\nI\u2019m just so happy that this all worked out. Those 3 months of struggle and learning was a tremendous boon to his health and lifespan. They even said they were going back on the diet before they got home from vacation. All the doctors are really impressed.\n\nI just can\u2019t thank this community enough. Without this subreddit my dad could\u2019ve been dead.

Everyday is like discovering my body anew, feeling all the bones and muscles that I forgot even existed. I've been too large for too long with no light at the end of the tunnel. Keto has changed my life for the better and in ways I never even dreamt possible. All the support I've had in these past seven months from friends and family, tagging me in keto videos, sending me keto recipes that they found, or even just taking my diet into consideration when we're out or cooking has been so touching and helpful.\n\nI've posted progress pics on here before that has inspired people to either start keto, continue Keto, or just not give up.

A dozen employees were there smiling and asking for me to try it on... but unknowing to them, I was a 4xl. When I broke the embarrassing admission to them, they said \"No worries, we'll just exchange it for a bigger size\". In that moment I decided enough was enough, a fire lit under me, and I told everyone \"No, I will fit in this before summer, just watch\". Some of them rolling their eyes in disbelief. Boy were they in for a shock :)\n\nIt was the day after Christmas that I started (why wait for New Years!? Get going now! :p ), and was all in to turn my embarrassment into a inspiration.\n\nI went years without getting a single compliment by anyone... and it did subconsciously take it's toll on me, and add to this self-fulling prophecy that \"I wasn't worth anything\".

It is under control by limiting carbs.  Measuring insulin resistance over time requires an insulin assay, which is not a test I have had.  \n\nI suppose I am lucky because eating keto has come easy for me and is a permanent lifestyle change.

This is in large why I did not post an update when I hit my actual 1 year anniversary 3 weeks ago, because somehow the fact that I did not hit my ultimate first goal of 65kgs, made me feel that I had failed in some way. \n\nIf I may speak to myself frankly... that is fucking ridiculous. I have come so far in the past year - both in an obvious physical change, but also in the general improvement of my mental health and motivation towards life in general. \n\nI'm proud of myself! I feel amazing! I need to stop thinking constantly about how much prouder and how much better I could feel a little ways down the track... because at least I'm actually heading there - as opposed to year after year passing with the number only staying stagnant or going up. \n\n[So here is my progress so far,](https://imgur.com/a/plGzt) a working progress that I am all the more excited to commit to steak and eggs and loaded-as-fuck cobb salads for another 12 months, might even throw in a cheeky 5k at some point just to really stick it to that part of my brain that is still convinced that I'm not actually 'doing it' yet. \n\nMore importantly, I want to help those that are struggling with not always feeling motivated, not always seeing the changes and not always feeling different even if they and everyone else can see it. KCKO - it works - it's worth it. TAKE PROGRESS PHOTOS and just keep on going. It's normal to not always feel totally motivated or totally centered on the task at hand, but trust me when I say: having a day where you've somehow convinced yourself that you haven't made enough progress will not erase the progress you have made; but going back to your old habits absolutely will. \n\nToday I felt like I was living in my old body, I felt insecure and unhappy. So I looked at my progress photos, told myself I was being ridiculous, and I realized that there is an entire community here going through the same thing, trying to break through the same old mental fuckery, that can give me some props (cause I've done well, yeah?) and that I can hopefully provide some inspiration for if you're in a similar position. \n\nThank you guys, here's to 2018 xx\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7smxz6/a_bit_overdue_but_thought_id_finally_share_what_a/", "created_utc": 1516799218.0, "score": 2937, "author": "hazier", "num_comments": 177, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/7smxz6/a_bit_overdue_but_thought_id_finally_share_what_a/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Why it's okay when people offer you non keto food, even when they know you're keto.", "selftext": "I see these posts a lot, and in the interest of full disclosure, I've even made similar rants myself even recently. Yesterday I had an epiphany. \n\nWe've all been there: \"I know you don't eat sugar but my wife made these brownies and you should try one!\"  \"I know you can't have carbs but a couple beers won't hurt!\"  \"I know you're on a diet, but one donut won't kill you!\"... ad infinitum...\n\nI've heard it all. I'm a programmer and my coworkers pretty much subsist on carbs alone.\n\nI always got angry. Always. Why do they want me to fail? Why can't they just let *me* do things my way? Why do they think they know better than me? Why do they have this \"crab pot mentality?\"  (I could go into the psychological theories of why we who are unhappy with ourselves tend to default to anger, but I digress...)\n\nI just realized, that's ALL WRONG.\n\nFrom a young age we're ALL taught that food is how you bring people together. Breaking bread with someone is a colloquialism found in every language. Norman Rockwell defined family by his portraits of families eating together, and \"teach a man to fish\" is a quote we all say.  Many cultures consider it an insult if you refuse a meal, and pretty much every Italian I've ever met takes it as a personal affront of they aren't allowed to feed you into a coma.\n\nThere's one universal truth: if you want to **show someone you care** about them, **share your food.**\n\nThese people aren't judging us, they're simply *trying to include us in the only way society has taught them* should *always be okay*.\n\nOften they seem \"angry\" if you refuse, but this isn't anger, it's confusion. This *should* work. It's what they've been taught. Is this guy refusing *because he doesn't want to be included?* Why? Does he not like me? What did I do wrong?\n\nSo I had this epiphany yesterday morning when a lady at work brought in her regular batch of carb laden goodies for everyone at work. She knew I would refuse (as I  always did) but came to offer again hoping THIS TIME she could convince me to be included. \n\nAll at once, I realized what was going on. This wasn't judgement on ME. She just couldn't figure out *how to include me*. But she kept trying.\n\nSo I smiled big, told her how wonderful everything smelled (and it did) but THEN I broke Rule #1. I explained to her that I'd lost 30lbs. for the first time in 20 years on this diet called \"Keto\" and the only way it works is by keeping my net carbs below 20g a day. I explained how net carbs were calculated, and how going above that caused me to get crazy hungry, making it REALLY hard to get back on track. I explained that it wasn't that I didn't *want* to try her cobbler because I *really* did, and it smelled exactly like my grandma's, but even a spoonful would spike my insulin. \n\nThen I explained to her that my wife and I have been trying for years to conceive. And in order to do that, I had to \"get my numbers straight\" and this diet was helping me do that.\n\nNot shitting you, she came in today with muffins... a fruit tray... and a sausage quiche.\n\nI could've cried. \n\nShe'd clearly gone home and done some research to figure out how to \"include\" me.\n\nStill haven't told my wife or figured out if I should even write her a personal thank-you, coz I'm still... emotional? (I'm 6' prior army. This is all new territory for me.)\n\nBut it's the single nicest thing a co worker has ever done for me, after months of me thinking all the wrong things about her attempts to include me.\n\n---------------------------------  \n\n*Edit: The worst part of this is that tomorrow when my wife wakes up and sees this thread, now I'm going to have to explain to her the quiche I ate and didn't report while she's been so diligent about recording our macros... Did NOT expect this response.  FWIW, pretty sure I didn't eat TOO MUCH quiche.*    \n\n----------------------------------  \n\n*Edit2: I forgot to mention that it was a CRUSTLESS quiche.

{"title": "2 months in, keto made me realize I was becoming an alcoholic", "selftext": "I've been a pretty heavy drinker for about a decade. Four years ago, I was also lifting weights and eating Paleo and with 23% body fat, looked the best I ever had.\n\nOne divorce, three moves, one remarraige, and one pregnancy later, I was miserable with my body, hadn't worked out in years, and ready to make a change.\n\nMy husband and I started keto two months ago. He works outdoors in a very physical job and calculating his macros was like doing advanced calculus. But regardless I was insistent that we do this the right way.\n\nWe both lost about 15 pounds the first month. After that he kept losing and I stalled. Even gained a few pounds. I knew I didn't want to drink less, so I ate less, and stayed stalled. I knew the drinking was the reason but didn't want to give it up. Spent every day wrestling with myself. Wanting to lose weight, knowing what I needed to do, and simply not doing it. I'd resist the urge to drink, then get bored or stressed and always find myself going to the liquor store.\n\nThis went on for a month before I got absolutely fed up with myself. I took a hard look at my habits, my goals. I realized that even if I was high functioning, I was developing a problem because it was so hard to quit. I realized I hadn't gone a day without alcohol in three months.\n\nSo I told my husband, because when he knows I'm struggling with something I feel more motivated to do the right thing for US. He said he was really proud of me for wanting to make a change and realizing that I wasn't happy with my habit. I told him I still would like to enjoy a drink on a date night, or share a bottle of wine with friends on the weekend, but I didn't want to drink on the weekdays or alone. \n\nSo far I've been able to stick to that, and didn't drink over the weekend at all. I've had a few moments where I was upset and really wanted a drink, but got busy with something else instead. Since then I've only had one beer while out at dinner.\n\nI also started working out. And while it's upsetting to struggle with ten pound curls when I used to use twenty, it still feels good to have sore muscles again.\n\nThe scale has gone down three pounds, up one, rinse repeat....\n\nBut I'm more excited about not feeling sick, being able to sleep through the night, regaining a sense of self control. I know I'll start seeing changes soon.\n\nI was going towards a very dark place and I think going keto is what made me see it. My motivation to lose weight made me really evaluate what was more important. I suppose any other diet may have done the same but because keto is so effective from the very beginning, when I stalled I KNEW what was hindering my progress. It sure as hell wasn't what I was eating.\n\nTL:dr- non scale victory in getting my shit together\n\nEdit:\nCame back to the internet with so many responses. I don't have time to reply to everyone but I've read every single comment.\n\n1, thank you for all the support and encouragement. I feel even more motivated knowing that not only my husband, but dozens of wonderful anonymous people over the world, are in my corner and believe in me.\n\n2, while I hope to one day be the kind of person who can drink socially or occasionally and be fine, I'm not there yet and intend to stay sober until I no longer feel like it's a fight to resist drinking. Right now my main focus is getting through each day without a drink and that's been getting easier Everytime I succeed.\n\n3, if you're in the same boat, and finding that it's just too difficult to give up, it IS difficult but just like going keto, it gets easier with each day. There will be days you can't resist and days you want to punch a wall but the sub /r/stop drinking has a ton of helpful posts from what I have seen so far that help remind us of why we want to stop. If you can find a support or accountability buddy because I COULD NOT do this alone. \n\n4, I'm doing great but I'm not going to say \"yep, problem solved.\" It sounds easy, like I just didn't drink one day and there you go... I'm not out of the woods yet and while I'm very motivated and determined, I know I cannot let my guard down.

{"title": "Today is my birthday, I have a chronic heart/lung disease & PCOS, I'm on oxygen, I get maybe 500 steps a day & I've lost 18 pounds in 6 weeks with KETO.", "selftext": "EDIT: HOLY COW!! Thank you all for the wonderful support & love! I am feeling it today! & I slept through the night last night, it's a birthday miracle! & THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD!! Mind blown.\n\nTL:DR I was diagnosed last year with a heart disease & I can't move much anymore, but I've lost weight on Keto & I'm celebrating my birthday!\n\nPer the custom, my story.  Today is my 37th birthday & even though my life is so weird & scary right now, I'm celebrating because I still have hope. I lost a lot of hope over the last year, 2017 was the worst year of my life. It started with a miscarriage of my first pregnancy after being infertile for over 5 years, moved to the illness & death of my wonderful mother\\-in\\-law, rounded third with a chronic illness and capped the year with unemployment. I mean, after all that, things HAVE to start getting better, right?\n\nIt was this time last year when I was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension & put on 24/7 oxygen. My life went downhill overnight & I was terrified that I could just keel over & die if my heart beat too hard (it literally could have). Within 6 months of my diagnosis, I was on disability leave & then let go from my job. I sold my car since I couldn't drive anymore & my husband learned how to schedule oxygen tank deliveries. I found the most epic doctors in the world (the guy who literally wrote the textbook) & we started diving into treatments. My life was now all about my heart & lungs.\n\nMy lungs have been horrible since I was a baby & it took 36 years of misery before my heart got too tired also. That's what pulmonary hypertension is, the right side of your heart is too big, for a variety of reasons. Mine was lung related & it meant that my heart won't go back down until it gets some relief or my lungs get better. They probably won't, so I may have a transplant to look forward to down the road. The oxygen is essential & I can't live without it. But that now means that I can't....do....anything that I used to, at least in the same way I used to. Going to lunch, to the movies, even to the grocery store are things that have to be scheduled, tank planning 101. It takes a toll & it's something that we think about all day long.\n\nAlong with the oxygen, my doctors also put me on a variety of medications to help ease my blood vessel pressures, with a lot of delightful side effects. Massive headaches three times a day, sinus pain, bloody noses almost daily, inability to sleep through the night, fluid gain, etc. So then I end up with new medications to help offset the side effects & the cycle continues. After a year of this, I'm also now on some lovely antidepressants, cause after all this, who wouldn't be depressed & anxious & scared to death of everything?\n\nAdding all this together...no movement, oxygen limitations, medicine side effects...along with always being one of the fat kids, my weight spiked almost overnight. As soon as I had to stay at home, I put on 15\\-20 pounds. The medications & water retention added another 10 or so. On top of all that, who wants to eat celery and carrots when you are stuck at home & super depressed & can't go anywhere? So let's throw some cakes & cookies & a shit ton of pasta & potatoes in the mix. In May, my peak weight was around 270 & I'm only 5'2''. My body was hurting & I was partially to blame.\n\nThen, when I was at my most miserable, my fattest self, hating my clothes, hiding under a big sweater, not looking at myself in the mirror, I heard a word floating around....K\\-E\\-T\\-O. I knew about keto, my brother\\-in\\-law lost a ton of weight with it a while back. & yes, I'd tried to loose weight too. I watched my calories like they were breaking the law (& only MAYBE 1200 a day \u2013 misery). I tried low carb/slow carb for so long that I was sick of beans. I tried salads for lunch & lean cuts for dinner. But nothing worked. Beyond not being able to move liked I'd used to (I actually used to go to the gym at 5am for a really long time), I also had PCOS & all the fat in the world just kept gluing itself to my stomach & belly. NOTHING WORKED. I have to weigh every day, because I'd gain 5 pounds in fluid & have to call my doctor. I would see the scale moving up & up & up & get more & more depressed.\n\nSomehow, that crazy \u201cK\u201d word stuck in my brain & I started poking around & looking at groups like this one. Hmm, I love bacon & steak & pork rinds. I saw that other PCOS women were having wonderful success. So I finally talked my husband into trying it, cause he's a big guy & we started on May 8th...and boy, let me tell you how I DOVE into some bacon. I can now eat a delicious New York Strip steak & enjoy every single bite. We've been doing lazy keto & it is such a relief to not have to count every meal, every snack, every everything. I keep my carbs under 20 & if I slip up, I learn from my mistake, enjoy it & move on. I'm not caught in the anxious vortex of accidentally overeating or trying to compensate from having 2 cups instead of 1 cup. I know weight loss is 80&#37; food & 20&#37; exercise & I simply cannot do the exercise part now. But I can control the food & it's working.\n\nBeyond the delish food part, I am more thrilled that I've actually LOST weight. For the first time in years, without having to be miserable at the gym every day or feel like a food robot, I am losing weight. My doctors are thrilled (I checked with them before I started), my clothes are feeling better & my body is starting to feel a little better. This is going to continue, because I know what I'm doing (thanks to these awesome groups!) & this is going to help my heart & lungs tremendously. And just today, I felt a jawbone. Huh, where did that guy go?\n\nSo trust me, guys, you can do this. If you're on the fence or worried about what the future changes mean or scared of kicking pasta out the door, YOU CAN DO IT! I can't even walk outside on my own, I'm on massive amounts of medication & I eat eggs, butter, cheese, meat, & cream all day every day & I've actually lost weight. I've lost pounds & inches & I'm gaining back some control over my life.\n\nToday is my birthday & I'm celebrating with a nice slice of steak.

{"title": "Lurkers", "selftext": "September 3, 1999 I went to a bariatric doctor.  I weighed 360 pounds.  A wee tyke you might say.  Even then, I was worried about my weight.  Anyway, the bariatric doctor gave me some pills and some advice and I went to visit her three weeks later.  September 24, 1999 and I weighed 346 pounds.  14 pounds in three weeks!!!  Holy crap this is cool!!!       \n\n\n\nBut, I was weak.  Mentally weak.  I worked 14 to 16 hours a day, 6 days a week, and because I was mentally weak, I allowed my dumb brain to speak.  Excuses started popping into my head.  Weakness.  So for the next 16 years, I got fatter.  Telling myself that \"tomorrow\" I was going to do something.  NO PLAN, but I would do something.  Needless to say, I did nothing and I got all the way up to 593 pounds.  Now, when you weigh 600 pounds, you don't have a whole lot of \"tomorrows\" in your future.  Eating myself to death.  Hopeless.  Trapped in fat.         \n\n\n\nTwo years ago, I had a friend sit down with me and give me a \"man to man\" talk.  He laid out a PLAN.  The plan was pretty damn simple:  Don't eat carbs.  We didn't know about macros or electrolytes or any of that fun stuff.  Hell, I didn't even know about r/keto.  So, on November 14, 2016, I stopped eating carbs.  And the weight dropped off me.  Of course it was water weight, but honestly, I didn't give a crap.  THE SCALE WAS MOVING DOWN!!!  I got the keto flu in the worst way, but I didn't know it was the keto flu.  I had not even heard of keto.  I was just eating zero carbs.  The Atkins Induction Phase.       \n\n\n\nMy apartment had a little back yard, so it had a back door.  I started walking.  27 steps from the front door to the back door and 25 steps back to the front door.  You see, I had to cheat and reach out to touch the front door because I was getting so tired.  52 steps and I was DONE.  Breathing HARD.  52 little damn steps for most people.  Mount Evererst for me.       \n\n\n\nBut, I had a PLAN.  Zero carb for two weeks then up my carbs to 20 a day.  That's the second step of Atkins according to my friend.  So I started researching recipes.  While doing so, I came across r/keto.  It was cool but confusing.  Lots of success stories by people eating the way I was eating.  Cool.  Macros and electrolytes.  Confusing.  But I kept reading.  I read for a month, devouring every post.  Every response.  Nothing I read changed my plan, so I actually subscribed.  Made my first post under my old account on here the day after Christmas 2016.  My introduction post.  Told everyone that I started at 593 pounds.  Was scared that people would say bad shit to me.  I was welcomed with open arms.  I was relieved.  And happy.  I have \"friends\" who understood my PLAN. It was like walking into a bar and everyone is happy to see you.  No one here cared if I was fat.  No one gave a shit how much I weighed.  They just wanted me to get healthier.  r/keto became part of my PLAN.  I kept losing weight.  I kept walking a little bit further.  Victories like walking 100 yards to the trash can.  My world getting a little bit bigger.  The PLAN was working. \n\n\n\nAugust 19 2017, was my mom's birthday.  That morning I weighed 443 pounds.  I called my mom and wished her a happy birthday.  Told her that her birthday present from me was 150 pounds lost.  Mom cried.  Happy tears.  That day, I was freaking bulletproof.  It was hot as hell outside.  I walked 1.12 miles straight.  No stops.  1.12 miles.  Sweating like a sinner at the gates of Heaven, but I was WINNING.  Bulletproof. Unstoppable.      \n\n\n\nAccording to my Samsung smart watch thingy, I walk a mile every 2300 steps.  I don't know if that is 100% accurate, but my Garmin thingy seems to say about the same thing.  Anyway, yesterday, I walked 11,900 steps.  Using my handy calculator, that means that yesterday, I walked 5.17 miles.  Long day at work.  Lots of steps.  I wasn't tired.      \n\n\n\nThis morning, I weighed 349 pounds.  Pretty excited to not see a damn 350 something.  Hoping that my 6 week stall is over.  I am no longer weak.  I am strong.     \n\n\n\nI will turn 52 years old this October.  I am lucky.  DAMN lucky.  Damn lucky that I got so fat.  Most people my age are trying to hold on to the past.  Squeezing tighter to the past.  Trying to wring the last bit of youth from their bodies.  I am damn lucky.  I am running to my future.  Each and every day is an opportunity for new...new everything.  Excited for my future.  Cherishing my life.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of carbs.  Suck the marrow from life.   That's my PLAN.       \n\n\n\nLurkers.  You are worried.  Scared.  Trapped in fat.  This is your \"man to man\" talk.  Make a plan.

I was so depressed at how big I was, I stepped on the scale and was blown away at what I saw.  I knew I was a big girl, but I didnt know I was THAT big.  After that moment and the feeling I had when I got the photos, I had my major wake up call.  I started Keto shortly after that and the rest is history!  Keto really helped me overcome my binge eating and take control of my life.  I have been keto for almost 2 years and just started weightlifting this past December. Weightlifting has helped me mentally to not focus on the scale as much. I'm losing inches and I feel so much stronger, so the number will catch up eventually.

They are removing the \"Calories from fat\" section. They correctly explain that there is not evidence that the entry provides any useful health information.\n\n2. They are enforcing new portion size increases. For example, ice cream is normally a 1/2 cup, but now it will be reported as 2/3 cup per serving because this more accurately reflects what most people actually consume.\n\n3. Foods that can reasonably be consumed in one eating occasion must list the nutrition facts for the entire package/bottle as one serving.\n\n4. ***Here is the most significant part*** - A new \"Added sugars\" section, with a DV% set to 50g. That means that many drinks, sweets, and more, will have upwards of 50% per serving! Even crossing 100% in many cases!\n\nSome of these labels are already starting to appear today. I believe that once we cross requirement day in 2020, and leading up to it, more and more people will become educated about sugar. From that, I think it's only natural that many will also learn about keto.

{"title": "\"Lazy\" or \"Dirty\" Keto is the only way I could stick to this long-term and it's still better than nothing.", "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of articles recently about how these nuances of Keto aren't healthy and personally, I couldn't disagree more.\n\nBefore finding Keto, I was eating out every single day. Gorging myself. I couldn't get by without a 2 liter of Coca Cola. French fries were my BFF. If I didn't have something I absolutely LOVED, I was NOT satisfied. I didn't have the money to do this, but I did it anyway and it drove me so far into debt.\n\nWhen I switched to Keto, I tried doing everything perfectly with clean ingredients, counting macros, etc. It worked. I felt better. I even spent less money. But I totally missed out on enjoying food and that made me feel super depressed. Everything I ate had to be prepared and socializing was such a process, all the time. I mostly did this clean way of eating because that's what various \"experts\" on keto told me. Needless to say, I fell off and on the keto train for about 2 years.\n\nI then started making choices that may be considered \"less than ideal.\" I would eat fast food burgers without the bun, enjoy a taco made from a low carb tortilla (seriously, I would eat one giant taco per day for a couple weeks), and I was still drinking my Coke Zero (it's very much a great substitute than the full sugar version IMO). My weight loss picked back up (although a little slower), but I felt better mentally, and my stomach issues were still improved. All things I loved about eating completely clean keto.\n\nI am not trying to say that eating clean is bad, but I do know that I see so many people quit because it just isn't sustainable. Or even enjoyable. Make conscious choices about what you're having. That's kind of been my philosophy for the past three years, and I've been able to lose about 90 pounds and keep it off effortlessly.\n\nWith that being said, if Lazy Keto is the only way you can make it work, freakin do it! Sure beats the constant yo-yo diet effect or falling completely off the wagon. Make it work for you.\n\nI wrote my rebuttal to those articles if you'd like to take a look: [https://nobunplease.com/dirty-lazy-keto/](https://nobunplease.com/dirty-lazy-keto/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/94rr24/lazy_or_dirty_keto_is_the_only_way_i_could_stick/", "created_utc": 1533474715.0, "score": 2712, "author": "dominicnbp", "num_comments": 483, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/94rr24/lazy_or_dirty_keto_is_the_only_way_i_could_stick/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "After 13 months on keto, I hit my goal!", "selftext": "I started keto September of 2018 after losing about 45 pounds or so counting calories and just generally trying to eat healthier. I was still about 300 pounds at this point. I lurked on this sub for weeks, devouring all the info I could. Really, didn\u2019t think I could stick to it. But I asked myself on that September Monday to just do it for one day. And I did it. So I did keto on Tuesday and made it easily through the week. The weight loss is a huge motivator first. It just falls off. I lost like 15 pounds that first month. More than the weight loss though, I felt so much better. It was easier to move around. I felt like doing more. My moodiness Improved. I\u2019m 51 and starting menopause. Hot flashes like crazy. But I\u2019ve not had a hot flash since February of this year!!!! My cycle is normal. Lol don\u2019t know for how long. It will come back for me eventually. But cheers for now keto!!!\n\nAs I said, the weight fell off quickly. But spring and summer were tough. That\u2019s where the work comes in. Weight loss for me slowed. My last 20-25 pounds took me about 5 months to lose.  There were about 6-8 weeks this summer where the scale did not move at all.KCKO. Very frustrating but the scale started moving again. And last week I hit my goal. Actually last week was a big one for me. Became a grandma too!\nBig shout out to r/xxketo4u2 and all the lovey keto bitches over there that keep me rolling on the daily! You ladies rock! Love you bunches. \n\nI\u2019m not done with keto. Never!! Now that I\u2019m in onderland, I need to think about an ultimate goal. I\u2019ve not weighed under 200 since 8th grade. Most of my life, 300 plus.

Typically, when speaking in person, it's hard to get everything you want across and even if you do, people get defensive.  So, anyway, here's the details!\n\nOne fateful day on June 30, 2017, I read an article about how Russell Wilson (Go Hawks!) got a new nutritionist after gaining weight and losing speed and stamina on the field.  Looking down that rabbit hole and after reading several books, I learned a TON about nutrition and general health that I never knew before.  Everything I thought I knew about being healthy was *wrong*.  The end product for me was a combination of the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.  This doesn't mean that I think keto and IF are **the** answer for everyone, but they worked for me.  I am a strong believer that each individual's biology is unique and what works for one person may not work for others.\n\nBUT, this is r/keto!   So, I'll dive into some of those details!!  \n\nWe're all well aware of what to eat on keto but here are some meals I have made over the months.  [NOMS.](https://imgur.com/gallery/caYfa)\n\nI started IF maybe a month into going keto (it just comes so naturally!) and even have dabbled in OMAD and some extended fasts.  Both of the latter I've done to try and combat loose skin.  I lift at weekday lunches for about 45 min just because when all this fat goes, I wanna like what I see underneath.  But by no means do I contribute that to my weight loss.  It's all about diet!\n\nCheers and KCKO!\n\nPS, if anyone has any questions about my diet, weight lifting, cardio (or lack thereof!), research, science, supplements, or food, PLEASE feel free to ask.

I don\u2019t want to splurge on any clothing until I\u2019m closer to my goal weight.\n\nSo I grabbed a pair of $20 jeans, size 22w this time and to my surprise they were way too big also! YOU GUYS.

{"title": "My 14 Points of Keto.", "selftext": "I've been on this sub for an entire year, and eating keto for 15 months; this being my first New Year as an experienced ketoer, I feel (probably wrongly) inclined to offer the small bits of wisdom I've accumulated with the help of this sub...at 2:00 in the morning, so it's guaranteed to be buried in other posts within a few hours (but I don't care because I had fun typing it all out). These are all the things I either wished someone had told me about when I started, or things people here *did* tell me that changed the way I looked at/did things because I didn't pay enough attention to the FAQ. Most of this stuff is in the FAQ, some of it isn't. They're in no particular order.\n\n\n1. *Electrolytes are REALLY important*, even if you think they aren't. You need like 5000mg sodium, bro (among others).  Powerade Zero won't do a damn thing unless you pour Lite Salt in it, which you should. \n\n\n2. *Take measurements.* I never did and I wish I had. Take before pictures too! I *did* take those and they really helped for those days I felt like I wasn't making any real progress. I was.  You might not lose weight at some points in your keto journey, but you're probably losing inches!\n\n\n3. *A \"stall\" is 5-6 weeks with no weight loss.* There were a few times I went 3-4 weeks without seeing the scale move, and then boom... I'd wake up one morning 4lbs lighter. Don't freak out if the scale stops moving if it hasn't been 5-6 weeks yet. \n\n\n4. *Recalculate your macros OFTEN.* I did it every ten pounds. You should not be eating the same calories weighing 150 that you ate at 200. Makes sense, right? Took me a bit to figure this one out, though! \n\n\n5. *Hormones go a little nuts.* For me as a woman, anyway. Ladies, I had a 54-day period when I started keto. STRAIGHT DAYS. I pushed through it and it eventually leveled out! My cycle is better now than it's ever been in my life, actually. r/xxketo helped me through that HORRIBLE ordeal! Check them out, those women kick serious ass. \n\n\n6. *Hair loss happens to some, not all.* My hair didn't start thinning until I was 7 months in and I'd lost 65lbs. It's not keto that causes it, though... it's weight loss in general. After upping my protein and taking collagen and biotin supplements (which I can't confirm for sure were effective, that's just what I tried), I'm starting to see new growth coming back in 8 months after the thinning started.  Still though, losing all the weight was WELL worth it.\n\n\n7. *Don't waste your money on urine strips.* Unless you're a type 1 diabetic, of course. Already bought some? Find a type 1 diabetic and regift them! That's not weird, right? \n\n\n8. Contrary to popular belief, *you don't have to do intermittent fasting with keto.* If you can eat for 12 straight hours and stay within your macros, then awesome! I accidentally started IF because I wasn't hungry in the mornings anymore and I've since progressed to OMAD...but if you don't want to, you don't have to. I love it, others don't. You do you. \n\n\n9. *I eat the same thing every. Single. Day.* I've seen people asking if this is bad. It's not. It's fucking awesome, simple, and I love it. \n\n\n10. *Protein is a goal, fat is a limit.* I was pouring coconut oil into my coffee and gagging on it because I thought I had to hit my fat macro the first week I did keto. Don't force feed yourself fat because of that number! In fact, if you're doing this for weight loss, you may want to rethink things like fat bombs after the first few weeks. \n\n\n11. *Buying new clothes is expensive* and incredibly rewarding. Mostly expensive, though. Don't pay a lot for your in-between-sizes wardrobe. Check out Goodwill or Target's hardcore clearance rack, and don't get attached to anything you buy at this point!\n\n\n12. *People are going to say stupid things to you* when they notice your weight loss.

Those people don't have to live with your weight, *you do.* The longer you stick with this way of eating, the easier it gets to tell people no when they pass you a piece of cake. \n\n\n14. *This sub is the reason I was successful.* I know in the end, it was *my* decision to stick with it, work hard to stay within my macros, not cheat a single time, blah blah blah. But really, without the daily (hourly, even!) support of this sub, I really wouldn't have reached my goal so quickly and efficiently. I created this Reddit account, my first and only one, specifically for r/keto, and I am so very happy I did. They are helpful, knowledgeable, wise, and eager to fix your issues (as long as you read the FAQ first...\"did you turn it on and off again?*) if you give them a chance.

When I started doing dishes at 9pm I was getting a little emotional because I NEVER have this kind of energy ever and usually when the kids go to bed at 7ish I was too exhausted to do anything but flop on the couch and whine about how tired I felt.\n\nI really thought this way of eating was going to be so impossible for me - I am totally a sugar addict and have quit sugar and sweetners before (only to go back to massive binges) but this is the first time I have ever thought about carbs in my life and the cravings are just... not there.

It was only when I've come across a picture from June this year (a few weeks before I started Keto) that I've noticed how significant the changes were.\n\nI used to eat so much food. I harked everything down my throat and never really thought twice about the way I looked because I was always chubby to begin with. I was already eating the amount for 4 people when I suddenly felt back pain. And it wasn't. Going. Away. My Ortho suggested I take medication for it, but strongly recommended that I lose some weight. My parents have been on keto for quite some time, and my mom even lost 60 pounds from it. Now her CW is 120 lbs and she's feeling better than ever. I decided to start last July.\n\nMy face definitely changed. I knew that, but I never really thought my body was also changing. I can now fit into old clothes I never used to wear from 6 years ago! I am so happy to be doing keto and definitely seeing the results in such a short span of time! I'm ready to be below the 200 category!!!

You don't have to run 5+ miles per workout or do a million reps of strength exercises, just MOVE YOUR BODY. When I started, I could only run for 90 seconds at a time before I felt like dying.

I know when I show my mom this she will be ecstatic. Another thing to mention is my father has had heart issues for the past 15 years starting with a heart attack and including multiple surgeries. He has had an aneurysm near his kidney for the past few years that a surgeon has been monitoring close to twice a year. This past consultation the surgeon said it has shrank rather than grown or stayed the same like the past visits. Again, thanks so much everyone.

I'm proud to say my mother inspired someone to give me my first reddit award.

She expressed a ton of agreement with those in the comments who have similar stories. I'll take the time to respond to as many as I can. She has a link to this subreddit now and will most likely see all of your comments. She's super proud of a post she made in a keto Facebook page getting 1300 likes but the feedback is nothing like the community here in this sub and I find this all very inspiring. I'm sure my mom finds all of your very kind and genuine comments extremely flattering. Some things she mentioned were she has hypothyroidism so to not believe that keto doesn't work with it. That her blood pressure has come way down and the doctor took her from 3 doses, to 2 doses of her medication for it and when she checks at home it seems it's dipping even lower now and may need to reduce the dose again. She also takes medication for regulating her heart as she has had atrial fibrillation issues in the past and the doctor halved that too. She hasn't had any issue since before starting keto. On my father's side she mentioned it's difficult to eat some things due to gout because of kidney damage from the diabetes. He uses lemon and celery seed supplements as well as tart cherry capsules and it seems to help. As a mom she emphasizes eating natural non processed and always reading the labels.

{"title": "What losing 35+ lbs looks like on a 5'0\" person", "selftext": "Hi guys, feeling a bit nervous to post a progress pic - but here we go.... Went from ~160 to my current weight 122 over two years, and lost the last 15 on Keto/CICO within the last 6 months:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/WSdyN4X\n\n\nFor my fellow short people: you CAN do this. You will lose weight very slowly, but stay strong and do not quit! Quitting is the only sure way that you will never reach your goal weight. \n\n\nThere were days (too many) that I ate over 2000 kcal, sometimes weeks where my average intake was 1600 kcal. There were sedentary weeks and days. But I logged EVERYTHING, and after each fuckup I always went back to CICO, monitoring macros, and exercising. The fuckups made me lose weight more slowly, but persistence is what helped me get here at all. \n\n\nIn the last 4 weeks I've been maintaining my weight, lifting weights (PPL) and doing HIIT by going to the gym 6 days per week. In terms of exercise, I've found that routine is your friend. If you always schedule gym in a certain time slot, then it's much harder to skip it, going to the gym just becomes part of your day-to-day.\n\n\nNow this might be a bit controversial for this sub - and let me start by saying it's 100% possible to lift on keto, and maintain on keto indefinitely - HOWEVER, I found myself constantly hungry and low in energy while lifting with little carbs (where keto never left me feeling very hungry before). So, in the last 3 weeks I've been adding them back to my diet to help with my energy levels/insane hunger while working out. \n\n\nI started the first few weeks slowly with upping from 20g to 50g, with 50% carbs consumed before going to the gym. This caused me to gain ~3 lbs back, but found that I felt more energetic and less hungry, which improved my motivation to the gym and work hard.\n\n\nNow I'm back down to my low weight of 122, and I'm upping to ~100g carbs and 1g protein/weight of muscle mass while doing CICO.\n\n\nThe point of this is - listen to your body, and do what works for you. If you need to incorporate carbs back in, do it slowly and be prepared to regain some initial water weight. Keto is a great and effective way to lose weight, and I'll forever be grateful for trying it, but don't be afraid to adjust your macros if it stops working for you or your lifestyle. \n\nBe flexible, be persistent, be honest with yourself about what you consume, and you'll get there eventually!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/fhipxo/what_losing_35_lbs_looks_like_on_a_50_person/", "created_utc": 1584029367.0, "score": 2507, "author": "blehh_blahh", "num_comments": 113, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/fhipxo/what_losing_35_lbs_looks_like_on_a_50_person/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Warning, real science ahead from a real scientist", "selftext": "I have long been a lurker, benefiting from many posts from this subreddit. I have been on keto for the past year and a half or so and have lost about 50-60 pounds. It has become a lifestyle and have even gotten my parents to stay on it for quite some time. They also see the benefits, such as my dad being taken off his diabetes medicine (type 2). \n\nI am a geneticist that primarily works on drug development and personalized medicine for a wide range of cancers but specializes in triple-negative breast cancer and thymoma. Yesterday, a major finding was presented at arguably the largest breast cancer conference in the world (San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium - AACR). For the sake of keeping things layman, I'll try not to go into details but can answer any questions. \n\nThe second most abundant dysregulated cellular pathway in cancer has been a pain to treat. For a number of reasons, the PI3K pathway has seen a fair share of inhibitors over the past 10 years, all with little success. Many report initial response to these inhibitors, but quickly become resistant. For this reason, many of the PI3K inhibitors are paired with chemotherapies or other drugs (one particular combination I am working on is in a Phase I in triple-negative breast cancer). Recently, it was found that insulin levels, which plays a part in this pathway, can modulate resistance to PI3K inhibitors. The scientist who originally discovered and described this pathway reported today that his lab is destroying patient derived xenografts (tumors from patients grown in mice). These tumors they are destroying are the worst of the worst (I can go into more detail if you'd like). We are talking grossly mutated pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancer tumors that do not respond to anything, even in vitro. How did he do it?\n\nHe put the mice on a keto diet and gave a standard PI3K inhibitor. That\u2019s right. Tumors that were not responding, are now completely responding to the point where he stated he was embarrassed he hadn\u2019t done this sooner.\n\nThis may be a lengthy post, and I have left much of the actual science out, but many oncologists have agreed that an individual with cancer would benefit from being on a strict keto diet. This is just one more link in the benefits of the keto diet.\n\nTldr: Keto diet decreases resistance to inhibitors targeting the second most abundant genetic pathway across all cancers.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/a41b9b/warning_real_science_ahead_from_a_real_scientist/", "created_utc": 1544199245.0, "score": 2480, "author": "drperryucox", "num_comments": 327, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/a41b9b/warning_real_science_ahead_from_a_real_scientist/", "html_title": ""}

I decided to attempt what I thought was impossible. People say you should start off slow and steady, making incremental changes, but I was in such a radical mindset that in the same day I took on Keto, Intermittent Fasting, Cold Showers, 5k or weights 5 days a week, Ashwagandha, Probiotics. My goal weight was 220 lbs to get back to my stasis. To cut a long story short, for the first time I actually stuck to something and didn't quit.

On April 3rd of last year, I decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally. I knew this time was different; my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before. Over this past year, I have learned so much, about weight loss, exercise, dieting, and myself as a person. Up until now, I have been able to lose 180+ pounds thus far.\n\nDiet:\n\nI believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques including Keto until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. One thing I have stuck with when doing Keto or any other diet plan is OMAD/IF (One Meal A Day/Intermittent Fasting) while keeping CICO in mind which has helped me a lot with staying within my caloric deficit and feeling satisfied with how much I am eating.\n\nExercise:\n\nI have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while I am simultaneously losing all the weight I am. So doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight I am losing.  Also, I workout (both lifting and cardio) in a fasted state, mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently. \n\nSince I started working out in April of last year, I have tried out a variety of routines (Bro Split, 4-Day UL, 6-Day UL, 6-Day PPL, 5-Day ULPPL) and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the 5-Day Upper, Lower, Push, Pull, Legs routine. I do this routine while incorporating cardio (usually HIIT) right after I am done lifting on at least 3 of those days typically. For my actual workouts, compound exercises like bench press, overhead press, deadlift, pull ups, dips, squats, etc. are key and incorporated as much as possible. I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn\u2019t done yet (about 40-50ish pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life. I plan to make as big of a positive impact as possible and help/inspire as many people as I can. This is just the beginning and I\u2019m genuinely excited for what I have planned in the future!

February and March saw a total of 5 lbs down, while I've lost 10 in April.\n\nI know what was slowing me down, and it really comes down to not paying enough attention to what I've been eating. I wasn't eating enough fat, so I was finding myself to be more hungry between meals and in turn snacking too often. While I was eating keto friendly meals and snacks, I was pushing my carbs and eating a lot of low fat snacks (like protein bars, and other low carb \"treats\") and constantly going far over my recommended calorie intake.\n\nIt went like that for most of February and March, and finally in April I started paying closer attention to my fat intake and carbs again. Once I was eating enough fat I was once again not as hungry throughout the day, and I snacked less frequently. I also decided to make my meals higher in calories (and fat) to keep me full longer, which meant less snacking as well.\n\nIf you hit a slowdown I highly recommend you reevaluate what you're eating. Pay attention to everything again, like you did when you first started!\n\nAlso, I'm officially overweight! It feels damn good to no longer be obese.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bi72di/keto_made_me_overweight_as_opposed_to_morbidly/", "created_utc": 1556421764.0, "score": 2421, "author": "filmgeekvt", "num_comments": 143, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/bi72di/keto_made_me_overweight_as_opposed_to_morbidly/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Why I regret doing Keto...", "selftext": "I know that being the Keto Subreddit, the diet gets lots of love around here. But let me tell you some of the reasons that I regret having started Keto.\n\nFirst, it's expensive. Since April, I've dropped two sizes in both my pants and my shirts. Do you know ridiculous it looks for a 34 waist to wear 38 waist pants? And the shirts look even worse on me. 5 months ago I wore an XL, and now, I have to wear a medium. A MEDIUM!! I don't even know where that section in the store is. I've had to buy a whole new wardrobe, and now my kids are starving.\n\nSecond, I'm always cold. I'm 'that guy' in the office complaining that they should turn the air down when its 85 degrees outside. I always have to leave a light sweater hanging on my chair so that I can put it on during the day. My fingers feel like they're frozen--which has greatly affected my productivity (it's really hard to type when you can't feel your fingers). It's super frustrating.\n\nThird, I'm always uncomfortable now. That kitchen set that I bought 6 months ago, with solid cherry wood chairs?? Useless. Now that I've lost a bunch of fat from my backside, it feels like I'm sitting right on my bones. It hurts. I need to adjust every few seconds. It's even uncomfortable sitting in the seat of my car. I did not sign up for this.\n\nFinally, people wont stop bothering me. It's actually pretty annoying. I was relatively unknown before, but now people are making all these comments like \"wow you look so great\" or \"what is your secret?\" or \"can you help me lose weight too?\" I can't just roll out of bed and stroll into work looking like a mess anymore. I need to take some time in the morning to look presentable, because who knows who might stop to talk to me. So I have to wake up like 30 minutes earlier.... it's killing me.\n\nIn all honesty, Keto has changed my life. For anyone who is contemplating Keto (or anyone who just started), I want you to know a few things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I was the guy who tried everything. Nothing worked for me, until Keto.\n* It does get easier. I promise.\n* People *will* tell you it's not good for you. Don't listen. If you are fat, I GUARANTEE eating Keto is better than how you're eating now.\n* If you have a spouse/significant other who also needs to lose weight, you have to get them on board. Sorry, but it's really challenging to have to cook separate meals for everyone, and it's really tempting to have those non-keto foods that your husband/wife refuses to give up.\n* Tracking Macros is important, but at first, I really recommend just focusing on carbs. 20-25 max. Don't guess. If you don't know, don't eat it. Track everything in MyFitnessPal and make sure to subtract the fiber and (good) sugar alcohols.\n* Speaking of sugar alcohols, do some research. Find out whats ok (stevia, monkfruit, erythritol) and what's not (sugar, maltodextrin/malitol, coconut sugar).\n* Finally, if you've failed to lose weight time and time again, set a short term goal. That's how I did it. I committed to 30 days, and no more. If I wasn't happy with the progress in a month, I told myself I'd quit. I figured, after 20+ years of eating whatever I wanted, I could surely sacrifice 30 days to give Keto a shot. Five months later, and I'm still going strong. You will see progress in 30 days, and it will motivate you to keep going. \n\nSW: 253lbs (January 2019)\n\nCW: 189lbs (today)\n\nGW: 185lbs (probably next week tbh)\n\nProgress Pic (nsfw): [https://imgur.com/a/gkzVTbO](https://imgur.com/a/gkzVTbO)\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the silver and gold Anons!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/d0zcrz/why_i_regret_doing_keto/", "created_utc": 1567879507.0, "score": 2415, "author": "Jwpjr", "num_comments": 271, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/d0zcrz/why_i_regret_doing_keto/", "html_title": ""}

I was at 348lbs before Carona and shot up to 368 2 months after lock down. \n\nI started feeling REALLY bad, no energy, my blood sugar was through the roof hardly left my bed for anything. I really wasn't eating THAT bad but I am now a believer that my body just cannot handle carbs.

Looking at it like CARBS = Sickness has given me a whole new view on things making it easier for me to stick to Keto.  \n\nI saw my doctor yesterday on Day 33 of my Keto journey. My appointment was originally scheduled to increase my metformin because my body had stopped responding to it and it was no longer controlling my BG levels. \n\nAnyhow, my Dr. was shocked.

{"title": "My 45 year old, morbidly obese son voluntarily started keto with me a year ago, weighing 385 lbs and well on his way to 400+. This morning he weighed in at 265, down 120 lbs.", "selftext": "He has Asperger's (Autism) and is incapable of supporting himself.  In some ways he's still childlike. He suffers from extreme low self-esteem issues and has since childhood. He came back home to live with his mother and I when he was 30.  That was almost 15 years ago now.\n\nOver the years of living with us we've seen his weight skyrocket as his addiction to high carb fast foods, highly processed foods and sugar ruled his life.  Up until he started keto it was like living with a junkie.  While we sustained a largely wholefood lifestyle he augmented it by also eating all of the shit food mentioned above.  Here at home, he constantly stole food from the fridge and the pantry. To the point where, in desperation, I put locks on both. \n\nNothing worked he just kept getting fatter and fatter.\n\nWe couldn't trust him nor could we find a way to effectively stymie his addictions.  We tried ultimatums, including the the most dire - cutting him off from our support and putting him out on the street with the rest of the homeless.  Turned out we didn't have enough parental fortitude for that one.  So he stayed and kept cheating and  pilfering food from us and growing ever more obese.\n\nThat was where we were a year ago when I finally hit bottom with my own addiction based overeating issues and decided to try keto.  That's when I invited him to join me - and he accepted.  He was 6'1'' and 385 lbs and I was 6'3'' and 316.  \n\nThat's when the magic began to happen in this household.  For us switching over to keto came with a steep learning curve that called for us to do things with food that none of the three of us had ever done.  We'd never weighed or measured our daily intake before.  We had no idea of how many carbohydrates were in anything, much less how to consume fewer than 20 a day to stay in ketosis. \n\nWe bought two kitchen scales and a whole set of small Corel dishes, bowls and saucers with which to do the job of incrementally weighing stuff up. Learned via  the keto FAQ here that we could trust the USDA site for good information and built an Excel database to help guide us.  My wife, who possesses gourmet level cooking skills massaged those ingredients into truly delicious daily meals. She's still doing it only now we rarely use a scale because we learned from those daily disciplines what's ok and what's not.\n\nHere, a smidge over one year later, I'm a normal sized person and instead of weighing well over 400 lbs (which without him changing things up was entirely possible) my son has lost over 100 lbs and is on his way back to normalcy.  He knows we're in a long distance race and not a sprint so, there's no way he can fail.  Cheat a little? Don't cheat? It really doesn't matter long term. I'm confident that eventually he will reach a healthy weight and it's only a matter of time.   \n\nSo, here was an unaddressed mystery?  How was it possible for my carb addiction driven son to put a stop to his obsessive overeating?  The short answer is it's because the driving force behind his overeating obsession was a carb driven appetite and that appetite has been put to sleep by keto and its satiating foods.  The same thing that was driving mine.  \n\nHere's the kicker:  In this past year my son's self-esteem has skyrocketed. His success with keto has translated into a complete change in his demeanor.  He no longer steals food and rarely cheats.  He is proud of his accomplishment and we are proud of him.  Such an unexpected bonus and win/win to come from going keto.  We have our son back. I have my normal weight body back.  As a man trying his damnedest to cope with life's many daunting challenges? I really couldn't ask for more.\n\nIn closing: I owe a debt of gratitude to the many contributors here and the moderators who've repeatedly shown me what is possible to accomplish with keto. Thank you one and all for sharing your experiences.  You've taught me so much. I'm not sure it's a debt I can ever hope to fully repay.\n\nBut that's why I'm here today, sharing my keto gains with you all. It's the least I can do.\n\nPs. This was written from the depths of my heart. Hope it helps.\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1bvvmzu/my_45_year_old_morbidly_obese_son_voluntarily/", "created_utc": 1712257449.0, "score": 2386, "author": "SnakebyteXX", "num_comments": 72, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1bvvmzu/my_45_year_old_morbidly_obese_son_voluntarily/", "html_title": ""}

Try not to fixate on the daily fluctuations and imagine what you'll look like 6 months from now if you stay committed. Because whether it's keto or ANY diet, committing to it is how you get results. \n\nThat is why I'm so vocal about making keto work for YOU. Dirty/strict/lazy/whatever, just conform it to YOUR lifestyle so you're able to commit to it long-term. Don't like to cook? I don't. Don't have time to work out? Me neither.

I am weighing in at 144lbs and I am 5'4\". No more being overweight!  \n  \nAlthough I didn't start Keto until January 9th, 2018, I consider my true weight loss to have started right after Thanksgiving 2017. I decided to cut out bread and sugar (I didn't know what Keto was at that time) and I figured if I could make it through the holidays without temptation then I could really commit. I was probably more than 230lbs at my heaviest but I didn't have a scale, I was scared of the scale, so I use 230lbs as my starting point. The last time I had weighed myself before starting Keto was actually May 2017, I was attempting to start a new diet/workout plan; I was 225lbs. I gave up after just a week or two. Then hurricane Irma happened in September 2017, damaging my home and I ate all the time to cope with the situation of having to find a way to repair my mold ridden, broken home while having to move to a small one bedroom apartment with my husband, son and our two dogs and cat. I felt lost not being able to take care of my home (insurance companies are a joke, just saying; we are still fighting it to this day). I was a chronic snacker, and I hated cooking because I think I resented not having my own kitchen and utensils, etc. so we picked up drive-thru often and binged on crap food all the time. I'm sure I gained quite a few more pounds because I truly lost sight of myself, my life, the way my son and my husband would need me.  \n  \nSo after seeing the first photo of myself in that white and blue dress from November 15, 2017 I knew I had to try harder this time to lose the weight; I honestly thought I looked okay that evening...yikes. I was also constantly suffering from headaches, high blood pressure, and just no motivation for anything. After Thanksgiving, I started eating better and by the time I discovered Keto in January 2018, I had lost about 15 pounds already; I was basically already doing Keto without even knowing it, so the transition was easier than I thought. We got back into our home in May of 2018 which has really helped with my progress!  \n  \n**What I did that I found helpful for my situation:**    \n-I weighed and tracked everything I ate until July because I finally got comfortable enough to not have to track (and I've continued to lose another 20lbs since then)  \n-I never had a cheat day to this day (saving that for whenever I can have a vacation, hah!)  \n-I did do intermittent fasting most days, usually only eat between noon and 6pm. I have been easier on myself with that more recently.  \n-I weigh myself everyday.  \n-I truly couldn't have been this successful if it weren't for this subreddit and /r/xxketo as well.    \n  \nI don't miss bread, the thought of it actually makes me feel full! I do miss Cheez-its and some desserts but my self control is truly a 180 degree difference from one year ago!

The scale isn't everything, I know, trust me I know, but this is a very big deal to me. When I got under 400, that was great and all, but I'd been under that many times in past years. But to be under 300, that's a big deal because as I mentioned, I haven't been this low in 13 years.\n\nKeto has been a fantastic tool for me. I've been at it for a year and 3 months. At times it seems like the easiest thing in the world; at other times, it's extremely frustrating and difficult \\(this year the scale just hasn't been as kind to me as last year\\). But not once have I ever even considered giving up. It's been life\\-changing and I cannot stress enough how happy I am to have found this lifestyle.

For me, I cut out artificial sweeteners \\(still allow erythritol and stevia, rest in peace my sweet Diet Mt. Dew\\) and started IF again and immediately lost 6 pounds in a week \\(last week\\).

And then eventually, being under 200 pounds \\(which hasn't been the case for me since middle school\\). I will get there, this is proof I can do it and will do it.

I use cronometer and document everything I eat.  I consume less than 2000 calories per day and because I run, I create a 500-1000 calorie deficit daily based on my cronometer app.  I also only exercise 5 days per week.\n\nOver the 26 weeks, I averaged 2.35 lbs per week, some weeks no movement on scale, some weeks more.  Never more than 2 weeks without going down.\n\nI consume diet drinks and does not seem to bother my weight loss.  I eat an excess of protein according to some, that also does not seem to affect my weight loss.  I drink alcohol on Friday and Saturday, bourbon and coke zero lately.  I always put the calories in my cronometer and it has not affected my weight loss.  I always try to keep my carbs at 0, I probably never go above 25.\n\nMy blood pressure is great 118/80.  My blood sugar is good in my opinion, it was 81 on Friday.  My ketones always above 1.5, over 3 most weeks (I measure once per week).\n\nI have done some 48 hour fasts and can run 5.5 miles after 48 hours and have no issues.  Ain't fat adaption great!!\n\nI am convinced this way of eating works, KCKO, any questions hit me up, happy to help however I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edited:**  One thing I should add, it is pays to be purposeful about this diet.  For me, that means getting up at 0330 so I can go running before I head off to work.  It seems like it might suck, but there is a sense of accomplishment that drives me to do it every day.

I just knew any day I would just die in my sleep. I had reached the point where I was going to have to rely on my family to do the most basic things. Finally, I decided to ask my wife for help. I didn\u2019t want to die and leave my family alone. She was ready. I was ready. Our daughter was ready. \n\nWe started Keto on March 7, 2018 after watching nearly every video on the Keto Connect YouTube channel. It made sense. We only had to make a few swaps and decide that we needed to go cold turkey on processed foods. And then the weight started falling off. I was able to start doing more. I had more energy. \n\nWe made a pact that we would try for a year to get healthy enough to travel. Three months later we were touring the Black Hills and Mount Rushmore. Then Rocky Mountain National Park. Then Sequoia National Park and King\u2019s Canyon. Now we want to hit every National Park before the year is up. \n\nWe\u2019ve joined a gym and continue to learn how to optimize our bodies. Keto may not be for everyone but it has saved my life.

I\u2019m about to break a 44 hour fast right now and feel like a million bucks. \n\nI just got some blood work back and was super pleased with the results A1C 4.6, fasting glucose 75, total cholesterol 180, blood pressure 107/65. I was nervous they would be out of whack due to fast weight loss, still being 340 lbs, my sodium intake etc. but no everything was great especially considering the circumstances. I\u2019m excited to really get after it and keep crushing it to get it all the way off for good. The plan is to eat this way for life I could never see going back. This sub is a huge motivation for me. I read it daily.

{"title": "From 470.5 to 209.5", "selftext": "Through meal replacement and ketosis, I went on [my weight loss journey ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Z0NooTS). Trying to keep maintaining now. Hard work!\n\nEdit: Sorry for leaving out some pertinent details, but I\u2019ll try to address some common questions that seem to be popping up:\n\n1. Yes, loose skin is a bit of an awkward problem. At this point I\u2019m just going to deal with it and not try to have surgery. It\u2019s mostly in my stomach. \n\n2. I used a meal replacement product called OptiFast and did weekly visits with a dietician and a doctor at an approved health facility. They monitored my progress, drew blood periodically and made sure at certain milestones that nothing went haywire with my heart or anything else. My experience was pretty smooth in that regard. \n\n3. After a bit, I was in a mild form of ketosis. As I understand it, when calories are as limited as mine were (800/day), you can have more carbs and still effectively be in ketosis. I think combined the five 160-calorie servings had like 75 to 100g of carbs per day. \n\n4. I had my gallbladder removed in 2015 so that wasn\u2019t an issue for me. But when doing this kind of very low-calorie diet, that can be a major concern. I know people sometimes have to take meds to regulate their gallbladder when doing OptiFast. \n\n5. I feel 1000x better doing everything now, including eating and exercising. My general quality of life has drastically improved and I\u2019m working on feeling more confident in my own skin (that part is the hardest). \n\n6. I try to walk 2-3 miles per day and am starting to do some muscle-building. \n\n7. I meal plan like crazy now. Cook large quantities of food and divide them up into meals for every week. I don\u2019t count calories so much as I count quantities of different foods now (ounces of veggies, starches, dairy, fat per day). I\u2019ve been back to eating food for about 2 months now and I feel pretty in control. I\u2019ve had bad days and good days in maintenance, but the number one thing I try to remember is that they\u2019re just days. They don\u2019t have to ruin weeks, months or years of work I have put in or intend to. \n\n8. I\u2019ll try to answer other stuff that pops up as I can. Remember I\u2019m not a medical professional too, but the reason I posted is because I know other people\u2019s stories gave me tons of hope and I want to do the same. Pay it forward, essentially. \n\n9. Thank you so so much for all the kind words and advice. It means a lot to me. I want all of you to succeed in achieving whatever your health goals are because I know how much achieving and working toward mine means to me. \n\n10. I used OptiFast shakes, soups and bars, five total servings a day. Usually one bar, two or three shakes and one or two soups.

Subway salad if I'm lazy and I'll add some grilled chicken tenders from oportos. Sometimes Ill get a meat pack from the grocery store and cook that, chuck it in a bowl with sour cream and a bunch of shredded cheese.  Sometimes I opt for a bunless burger and a couple of nuggets (I still enjoy nuggets on this woe.  Most places 3 nugs are about 7g carbs) \n\nDinner: we have a wide range but our lazy go to meals are fathead pizza..  Sliced chicken lasagna...  Whey protein fried chicken with some veggies..  Chicken schnitzel made with a number of different crumbs. Occasionally we will just go to McDonald's and get triple cheeseburgers or KFC and get a couple of original fillets even though that's higher in carbs about 7g each fillet.  \n\nI really just eat what I want now but still in a keto sense..

By eating absurdly delicious food to satiety I've gone below my high school weight, am effortlessly maintaining and just look better and better each month. Mental health is fantastic -- tons of focus and memory improvements, I sleep better (and need less), plenty of energy whenever I need it, stable mood, etc.\n\nDigestive issues, heartburn, and allergies somehow are just completely gone.\n\nSomehow I've achieved all this by eating the best food I've ever had over and over, as much as I want (usually not much, I fill up quick these days).

{"title": "100 pounds in 24 weeks", "selftext": "(https://imgur.com/gallery/eYpaI9c)\n\nToday is the day. After just shy of 24 weeks, I hit the 100 pound mark. \n\nLike most folks here, I\u2019ve battled my weight for as long I can remember. The cycle always looked like this: exercising a ton, get used to eating more, get hurt, get fat, hit the point to which I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, start exercising a ton combined with strict dieting, get hurt, rinse and repeat. Not only would I put all of the weight back on, but that number would make significant leaps upward before I would find the motivation to make a change. In college, it was 235. A few years after college, it was 265. Then it grew to 300, and recently, was 330. \n\nI had hit 330 in 2014. Disgusted with myself and miserable, I made a commitment to exercise more and follow the WW program. Before long, I was doing multiple hours of cardio 4-5 days a week. After completing a 13-mile run just to see if I could, the decision was made to train for a marathon. The weight came pouring off, but I found I needed to carb load to get through the 36 miles I was running each week. After finishing five full marathons and numerous halves that year, I was down to 236. Then I pulled a hamstring. This was followed by a torn meniscus. My running career was over, but I kept eating in the same way. \n\nCouple this with a move from frontline firefighting work to a desk job, and I put on 80 pounds in just over eight months. After reaching 328 in 2016, I finally pulled myself together. This time it was WW and heavy gym activity. A botched knee surgery left me with the pool and elliptical as my only options; so I attacked them with same ferocity I had my running. The weight came off (down to 265), but I quickly burnt out. I hated what I had to eat and quickly tired of swimming laps and spinning wheels on machines. \n\nBy this past summer, I was back up to around 330 again. But this time, I just couldn\u2019t find the motivation. I knew I didn\u2019t want to do WW, and I knew I couldn\u2019t stomach the elliptical. I could run two or three times before the pain was too great, but that obviously wasn\u2019t enough to make a difference. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I was tired of the stares, of the disbelieving or shameful looks when people found out I worked for the fire department, having to be concerned about fitting into booths or airplane seats, and the quickly diverted eyes. Still, for months, I just couldn\u2019t get over the motivational hump. \n\nOn Labor Day weekend, my wife and I visited Las Vegas with some friends. This was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. The plane ride was absolutely brutal. There was a moment of panic when it looked like I would need a seatbelt extender and I had to sit balled up as tight as I possible could for four hours both ways. In Vegas, I could feel the eyes on me and sense the utter lack of respect I was receiving. For some reason, it really hit me hard.\n\nIt made me ponder who I really am - what do I believe in and who do I aspire to be? How had I gotten to this point? What did the best version of myself look like and how do I get there? This self-examination was coupled with one of the people we were with introducing me to Keto - and the rest is history. \n\nOver the next six months, I went on to drop 100 pounds. I did this with minimal exercise and eating food I find delicious. While me caloric intake was cut considerably, it was much easier to handle knowing I was going to have an amazing ribeye later that night. There were definitely tough periods, but the way the weight was falling off helped me to stay motivated. \n\nNow, this is a way of life. My blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels have all improved immensely. The weight loss has allowed me to run again (ran 5.5 miles around downtown last night). I\u2019ve taken off over 14 inches around my waist. The only bad thing I can say is that I have literally nothing to wear that doesn\u2019t look ridiculous. While I will eventually up my carbs from under 20 to under 50, I do not see altering my diet anytime in the next few years. \n\nOn top of all of this, I am weeks away from finishing my Masters, applying for a doctoral program, midway through the National Fire Academy\u2019s EFO program, and overseeing one of the biggest projects in my department\u2019s history. There is no way I would have had the energy or focus to tackle all of this seven months ago. \n\nThe reason I believe this change will last is because it hasn\u2019t been exercise dependent.

I last saw them May 2018. I started keto July 28th, 2018 at a starting weight of 378.2 lbs and have not told them that I am doing keto. As of this morning I am at 305.0 lbs! I am going to try to hit 100 lbs lost by the time I am set to go visit (May 18th) but even if I don't hit 100 lbs I know they are going to see a major difference. \n\nEverytime i talk to Mom on the phone she asks if anything is new and it is so hard not to tell her about my progress. The reason behind not telling her is that I have very critical and judgmental siblings and I don't want them filling my Mom's head with \"how bad keto is for you\". I want to show Mom that after almost 10 months, when I see her, that I am healthy, have more energy, and more importantly  I am starting to love me for the first time in my 36 years.\n\nI want her to see that keto is a great lifestyle change and I am hoping that she and my stepdad will try it out. Mom is diabetic and overweight and my stepdad is overweight too so I think this change in lifestyle is exactly what they need to get their health back on track.

{"title": "Keto pro tip: The point of keto is to eat food that satisfies and gives you energy without triggering the urge to eat more. If you are eating keto compliant foods that are causing you to binge, they may be hurting your weight loss efforts.", "selftext": "Ok lads so here is a bit of a harsh truth.  Keto works as a weight loss aid largely because it helps deal with hunger and energy while removing the quick dopamine hit that drug-like edible things cause.  Of course there are other benefits regarding inflammation, auto-immune diseases and so forth but I'm going to stick with weight loss here.\n\nThere are many foods that are low in carbs that trigger binge eating in people who are prone to binge eating.  Keto cheesecake is great but not if you cannot stop eating it once you start.  While it may not cause the same blood sugar roller coaster that a sugar-laden dessert would, eating 2000 calories of cream cheese on top of the rest of your food that day is one reason many people stall.\n\nAsk yourself this:  When I eat a thing, am I more hungry or less hungry after eating it?  If you are more hungry or the same level of hungry, consider removing it from your diet.\n\nFor me, the triggers are sweet things and roasted salted nuts.  I can easily eat a pound of macadamia nuts in one go.\n\nRemember that junk food is still junk food even if it has better macros, and that keto treatos should be something that is an \"In case of emergency break glass\" sort of thing, or at the very least a special occasion treat!\n\nIf you are finding your weight loss efforts are stalling or you do not feel as in control of your eating as you would like, take inventory with this in mind and make changes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/gsxb1m/keto_pro_tip_the_point_of_keto_is_to_eat_food/", "created_utc": 1590773493.0, "score": 2160, "author": "stupidrobots", "num_comments": 267, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/gsxb1m/keto_pro_tip_the_point_of_keto_is_to_eat_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Thank you, Darius at McDonald's!", "selftext": "I was on and off of keto all throughout 2018, never able to stick to it mostly due to financial struggle and depression. I'm still dealing with the financial shit and the depression but I've made a point to start back and take it more seriously. One week in and so far, so good. \n\n\nMonths ago, I discovered an easy lunch I could grab on my hour break from work, but it was a \"complicated\" order at McDonalds. I use quotes because honestly it isnt that difficult, but 9 times out of 10, they found a way to fuck it up, all the while acting annoying that I'd have such ridiculous dietary needs in the first place. But finally I found one store with a dedicated employee who not only got my order right, but made it look BEAUTIFUL and remembered me every time I rolled through, which became pretty often. \n\n\nMy order is essentially a bunless burger on a platter. Two quarter-pound patties, each with a slice of cheese and tomato, served on a bed of lettuce. A ramekin of mac sauce on the side. That's it! And its filling and delicious and only about $4, so I consider it my weekly indulgence on the days I don't meal prep. I've actually posted an image of the meal on this account if you want to behold it in all its meaty-cheesy glory. And yes, I eat the whole thing in my car while watching The Office before going back to work.\n\n\n\nWell, it has been about 2 or 3 months since I've been keto, so I haven't revisited that McDonald's nor tried that order anywhere else. This week, on a short lunch break, I begrudgingly made my way to their drive-thru, dreading having to explain all over again exactly how to make my order, having to bother the kitchen staff to go out of the way for me, being made to feel annoying, and ultimately getting *not* what I ordered. \n\n\nSo it began in the usual way - I pulled up to the drive thru and rolled down my window. \n\n\n*Hi, Welcome to McDonald's! What can I get for you today?*\n\n**Umm, well, I'm sorry - my order is kind of weird --**\n\n*Hello again! It's been a while! Let me see... two patties... cheese on both? With lettuce and tomato? Is that correct?*\n\n**Uh Wow, yeah! And also --**\n\n*A mac sauce on the side! Itll be $4.03, please pull around!*\n\n\nSo I'm sitting there a little astonished that of the thousands of customers they must've had since me, this one employee remembered me and my entire order - and even stepped away from the payment window to check with the kitchen and make sure it came out right - and has never once treated me like a bother!\n\n\nEven the guy at the second window was like, \"Wow, that's quite an order.\" (I really don't get why it's so strange but whatever.)\n\n\nSo anyway, it wasn't a big deal or anything but it did make me feel really good, not to mention how impressed I was at how this young man handles his job.\n\n\nThank you Darius! \n\n\nTLDR; Had a complicated Mcdonalds order. Dude remembered my order a few months after I went on hiatus and still made it perfectly without making me feel like a nuisance!\n\n\nPS - I have reached out to corporate and left a detailed compliment regarding Darius and his work ethic so hopefully that review trickles down to him in some way. I'm also going to start carrying cash so I can tip him next time. I believe dedicated work deserves reward.\n\n\nEdit:\n\n- For those asking, mac sauce is 3 carbs per serving (which is either 1/4 cup or 3 TBSP, not sure. I can usually fit that into my day.\n\n\n\n- I order it the way I order it because ala carte patties are cheaper than ordering the Double QP, and the quarter-pound patties are larger than the mcdouble and the like. \n\n\n- Nobody ever said anything about anyone being 'stupid' or 'incompetent' for not getting the order right. I know the order can be confusing which is why it's so nice that Darius not only gets it right but exceeds expectations. I mean [just look at it](http://imgur.com/a/njXgHeI) in all [its cheesy glory.](https://imgur.com/pUFXAfO)\n\n\n- Thank you for all the other fast food keto pointers! I'll have to try them out on future lunch breaks.\n\n\n\nEdit 2 - I've used the app before but I actually really enjoy human interaction so I usually refrain from stuff like that unless I'm really not feeling social, which happens occasionally! \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/afduxc/thank_you_darius_at_mcdonalds/", "created_utc": 1547340418.0, "score": 2130, "author": "YOLO_Chef", "num_comments": 219, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/afduxc/thank_you_darius_at_mcdonalds/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I tried quitting countless times without success. And of course drinking a bottle of wine every night contributed heavily to my weight gain. But then I started keto and without the carbs in my body, my tolerance dropped to 1-2 drinks max that would then give me killer hangovers and make me feel so shitty. So I stopped.

It was one of the worst days in my life. The tears, they just wouldn\u2019t stop flowing. I couldn\u2019t believe how bad I let my health go. \n\nAt 263lbs, and only 24 years old, I was prediabetic. I completely stopped getting my period. My bad cholesterol was..bad. And the good cholesterol? Also bad. My body..it ached. Every day. By the time I got off work, I quite literally felt crippled. My feet, killing me from the weight it had to hold all day. My little boy, wanting to play, and run with his mother, and I tried, I just couldn\u2019t do it for long. While the physical ailments were horrible, the mental anguish hurt just as much. \n\n\u201cHow could you let yourself get to this point?\u201d I needed a change, and I needed it immediately.\n\nThat\u2019s when I found you guys.

The content here, and the people who so bravely posted, and so kindly offered support and advice to one another was instrumental in my own progress. \n\nThese past two years have at times, been very challenging. Completely changing your aspect on food, and what it does to, and FOR your body has been the biggest hurdle. Giving your brain time to catch up to this sudden physical change, has been hard too. But let me tell you something..\n\nIT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE BIT OF IT. My doctor, the one who told me about my prediabetic state is elated. She has never seen anyone make a turn around like this.

So I sent my teenage daughter to go grab milk and told her that I'll be in the produce section. This task I sent my daughter on should have only taken 3 maybe 4 minutes tops! So you can imagine that after 10 minutes go by, I'm wondering where the heck is that kid? As soon as the thought crosses my mind, my cell phone rings, I pull it out of my pocket and see it's my daughter calling, but before I could hit the talk button, the phone stops ringing. I didn't have time to hit redial because further down the aisle I see my daughter walking towards me. I asked her if she had trouble finding the milk we get since it took her so long. She said, no, she just had trouble finding me. I asked her how could she have trouble finding me when I told her I was going to be in the produce department. She said she did look, 2x in fact, and went to check the other aisles. On her 3rd attempt to find me, she stood at the end of the aisle of the produce section and called my phone, heard my ringer and that's when she was finally able to locate me. I told her it didn't make sense because there was only 3 other people in the produce area besides myself and the store wasn't crowded or busy at all. Her response was: \"Mom, to be honest, I had a hard time finding you because I was looking for someone wider.\" She explained that she had seen me the 3x she came to the produce section but it didn't register in her head that I was her mom because she was looking for someone bigger.\nHoly crap! That blew my mind and my jaw just about hit the floor! I honestly didn't know how to feel or what to say. A mix of emotions washed over me. It was a combination of happy and proud, but guilt and shame...and all at the same time. \nIt got me thinking, my 16 year old daughter, (who is also my first born), had seen me in a heavier state her whole life because it was after her birth that I started to put on weight, and this heavier state was normal to her. I may be an excellent mom to both of my kids but I did them a great disservice by letting them grow up thinking that my obesity was normal and okay.

{"title": "If you are thinking about KETO read this.", "selftext": "\nFuck most of what you read. Fuck the wiki on the side-bar (but seriously do read it at some point). And fuck your weight. \n\nPeople overcomplicate this diet. Cut the gat-damn carbs and up the gat-damn fat and protein. That's LITERALLY IT!!!!\n\nMy biggest problem before I started was I was a CONSTANT snacker and had a sweet tooth. After starting this diet I realized I was never satisfied. I WAS ALWAYS FUCKING HUNGRY.\n\nFat makes me not snack. If my fat count (I generally get mine from meat so I get my protein) is low I feel the need to snack. As long as I feel full, I do t snack. \n\nTrust me when I say this, all you need to succeed is meat, cheese and green veggies. \n\nMy mom is a pastry chef and culinary arts instructor. I grew up into my early 30s with the biggest fucking sweet tooth in the entire damn galaxy. If it's a baked confection, I will like it. \n\nThis diet doesn't have to suck or even be expensive. I come from a father that cooks literally everything on the grill so picked up a few things. I have tons of meat ready to go. I do tons of smoked pulled pork bc it's cheap as fuck even if it isn't on sale. I buy a brisket occasionally. I make meatballs in bulk with 80/20 Ground beef (probably the cheapest and has a high fat count) mixed with ground italian sausage, I'll eat them with an egg for breakfast and microwave veggie for lunch. I buy lunch meat from the Walmart deli ( salami, roast beef and pastrami) and I'll wrap it over a mozzarella cheese stick (0 carbs btw) for a snack. This shit is cheap AF compared to the processed packaged shit I used to buy. \n\nLet me put it this way, generally a thing of decent ice cream, or little debbie cake or package of chips ahoy (fuck I love those) is about the same as some deli meat. \n\nThrow the fucking bullshit out if your house if you can. If you are like me[I am the only one in my house on this diet (wife and three young boys)] and can't throw everything out,  carve a section of the pantry for your stuff. I have a shelf dedicated to my stuff. My shelf is eye level when I open the cupboard or pantry door bc I want it to be the first thing I see. Not the sweets or carbs. \n\nAnd for ducks sake, get a Costco membership if you can (US only). Costco is a Ketoers playground. They have all kinds of delicious shit that I would enjoy even if i wasn't on keto. If you doubt me, go to one and see. They will let you walk the store with our signing up. They have all kinds of shit listed as keto friendly. Just read the fucking label. \n\nOne tip I have is to google stuff or search the various sub-reddits dedicated to keto. Want a pizza??? There's a keto version. Craving fried chicken??? Keto version (seriously I just made the top google result like 3 days ago, twas amazeballz). Love I've cream, there is a fucking keto ice cream (but don't eat the entire damn thing. Chances are you have a sweet tooth that less than1/3 a pint will curb. Then eat more fat to feel full if necessary). \n\nSeriously this diet isn't fucking hard. I've lost more weight than I have in any other diet and I have more energy than I know what to do with (fucking finally). \n \n\nAlso, I know there might be spelling errors, but IDGAF bc I'm on mobile and drinking bourbon (neat of course) bc you can do that on keto. In fact there is an entire sub-reddit dedicated to drinking on keto. \n\nTLDR: Trash the bullshit, read the label, eat the fat.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m89fvv/if_you_are_thinking_about_keto_read_this/", "created_utc": 1616129023.0, "score": 2100, "author": "aStinkyLoad", "num_comments": 504, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/m89fvv/if_you_are_thinking_about_keto_read_this/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I was a size 8 at the time but of course my body was not remotely fully formed. My hips were still growing, my bones were still growing and I was still going through puberty. To compare myself to that size/shape now as a 27 year old woman is fruitless. Still, over the years, I have compared myself many times. Being in a relationship and spending endless Saturdays and summers cuddled on the sofa surrounded by Doritos and milkshakes slowly led to me piling on the pounds. At 19 years old we rented our first place together, around the same time I started a full time job at McDonald's. Without Mum cooking me dinner and with permission to take home from work bags containing enough leftover fries and nuggets to feed a small army, my weight kept on soaring. I got to a point of eating 5 McDonald's meals a day - I was addicted.\n\nWhen I was half-way to 20, my Mum could see that things were spiralling out of control and so offered me the incentive of an all expenses paid shopping trip if I lost some weight before my 20th birthday. A week later I signed up at Weight Watchers and weighed in at the heaviest I had ever been and ever would be\u00a0 - 15 stone and 8 pounds - I was a size 18-20 and needed an inhaler to get up the stair. This was the first real diet I had ever been on (bar trying grapefruits / slim shakes / Adios diet pills in college) and I took to it like a duck to water. I lost 69.5 pounds in 5 months. I was the youngest member of the class and everyone was inspired by me - it felt amazing. My husband even joined me a couple of months in to support me and lost some weight too and we became part of the staff.\n\nWhen I reached 10st 8.5 pounds - it all went wrong.\n\nMy goal had been 10st 8 pounds and I just couldn't shift that last half a pound. Not that I ever really stalled - it was only 3 weeks. But I'd gone from losing every single week and I just couldn't take it. I felt like a failure.\n\nOver the following 8 months I spiralled in to bulimia - somehow managing to hide it from everyone whilst feeling trapped in my own personal hell. Eventually the burden became too much to bear and I broke down to my husband, confessing everything. I never made myself sick again. (I never even shook that half a pound throughout my bulimia - I just maintained and then slowly gained and gained, all the while eating ridiculous volumes of junk food whilst hidden in the bathroom).\n\nWhat followed was 6 years of yo-yo dieting hell, starting at my top weight once again. I gave Weight Watchers another go, losing a couple of stone and then regaining it all. Then I tried Slimming World - the same happened again. I tried Low Carb (the wrong way - trying to see how much bread I could fit in to 50g carbs a day.) Still, I\u00a0wasn't\u00a0happy. I tried Low Carb a couple more times, singing it's praises and its satiety - but I'd only last a month or so, eat a cake and then end up right back at the beginning again.\n\nIt finally changed when earlier this year, having rid myself of all junk food in the house, I was so desperate for\u00a0sugar that I\u00a0baked myself a tray of 12 cupcakes and ate them fresh from the oven with a spoon. My husband turned around from his game and\u00a0saw\u00a0what I was doing and I burst in to tears. I couldn't keep doing this to myself. We had a long talk and decided this was it - things would change.\n\nOn the 11th June 2018 I started Low Carb properly (50g net carbs a day) and stuck to it religiously,\u00a0even\u00a0throughout\u00a0a holiday to the Lake District which had a lot of cream teas and stodgy pub food to offer. I found I wasn't really losing weight, even though I had more energy.\n\nOn 12th July 2018 I decided to try something I never had before. Keto. 20g net carbs a day. It sounded impossible. With Low Carb I always hit 50g and always fancied a little bit more. I could still fit in space raiders crisps and fun size bags of haribo. How could anyone do 20g carbs a day?!\n\nBut you know what... I bloody well went and done it.\n\nOn 26th January 2019, just 6 months after starting keto, I reached the elusive 10st 8 pounds. I just couldn't believe it. Seeing that number looking back at me from the scale felt so surreal. It's the middle of Feb now and I've lost 4 more pounds and I feel incredible. I joined a gym at the end of December (something I never thought I'd do) and I can feel and see muscles forming throughout my body. It's crazy!! I'm so frickin' happy!\n\nThe NSVs along the way (as well as my wonderfully supportive husband) have made the journey all the more special:\n\n\\- I wore a size 10 red dress to the Office Christmas party. (A dream I'd harboured for many years), I went out drinking in a sparkly body con dress, I joined a gym and exercise without embarrassment in front of strangers, I can go shopping for size 10 and size small clothes, I've lost more than the body weight of my 13 year old sister, I've lost a total of 30.5 inches across my body (10.5 off of my waist!), I've gone down 3 ring sizes (I didn't even realise I had fat fingers), I'll wear clothes that show my arms, I've lost over a third of my body weight, I've inspired others to start keto (others that a couple of months ago told me to cut back on the bacon cause it'll kill me)\n\nAll of the above, a few months ago, seemed laughable and unattainable and downright impossible but here I am. I've hit my goal but I'm going to keep going and keep making my body stronger and keep on keto-ing on because I love this way of life and dreams really do come true.\n\nTLDR: Nearly a decade of yo-yo dieting, cured by keto.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am absolutely overwhelmed at the response to my post. I honestly thought maybe a maximum of 10 people would see it and it would disappear in to nothingness, but apparently not! I woke up this morning to 2 Gold and 1 Platinum and I'm in absolute shock. I do not feel deserving - it's just me and my story and I just wanted to share it. I could never have predicted so many people would be interested in my waffling on!

When I first came here, I knew NOTHING about keto. When someone mentioned keto to me, I thought it was a type of martial art. For all you newbies, I encourage you to read the posts, read the FAQ and immerse yourself. Your dreams CAN come true if you just allow yourself to accept the possibility that it can be a reality.\n\n**Supplements/Medicine**: For medicine, I am currently taking Allopurinol and Levothyroxine and have for years. At one time, I was taking Pravastatin, Metformin and/or Kombiglyze and that has all ceased. I was diagnosed at a T2 diabetic and now all those symptoms are gone. For supplements, I am taking Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Vitamin E, Orange Triad multi-vitamin, PhosphatidylSerine (at night to aid with sleep), Turmeric Curcumin with Ginger (to aid with inflammation), Fish Oil, 350 mg Magnesium, 1250 mg Potassium and 5000 mg Sodium.\n\n**Blood Tests**: My fasting blood test as of this mornings weigh-in was as follows: 75 Glucose, 33% HCT, 11.2 HB, 2.5 Ketones. I use the Keto-Mojo equipment you can find on Amazon and test at least once a week.\n\n**Food/Macros/Micros**: At first, I tried to eat a wide variety of foods so I wouldn't feel bored with my selections. After awhile, it just became as hassle to have to track macros for each recipe and variation of it. The fact that I would get bored with my food made me readjust my mindset. I made my life more interesting and fulfilling with food becoming an enjoyable way to fuel my body. After a few months, I narrowed my food choices down to allow reasonable management of the tracking. As of today, my staples are Ribeye Steak, Filet Mignon steak (rarely), Blue Diamond Wasabi, Smokehouse or Salt/Vinegar Almonds, String Cheese, Fat Bombs, ChocZero 50% Dark Chocolate, Salted Peanuts and Dry Rub from Buffalo Wild Wings. This encompasses 90% of what I eat, with the random Caesar Salad (no croutons) or Double Stack from Wendys (no bun) tossed in from time to time. I do drink Diet Coke Zero and sparkling water. Every single day, I drink 144 oz of water - no exceptions. The only macro I track is carbs and always stay under 25g. I am confident the rest of my diet is dialed in pretty good. I eat about 1800 calories a day, 900 each meal.\n\n**Exercise**: Due to past knee injuries, I didn't exercise until I was under 300 lbs. Need to protect those joints. Once 300 lbs came and went, I started to lift weights 2x a week (full body, strength-based program) and play basketball. I also spend 15-20 minutes in the sauna after I exercise.\n\n**Fasting**: I do a 16-8 IF every day, but have done 20-4 or 24 hours. I eat at 1PM and 8PM pretty consistently.  If I am eating OMAD due to life getting in the way, that will be at 5PM.\n\n**Goals**: My entire mindset changed during keto and I now try to live a goal-based lifestyle aimed at achieving all my dreams. My gym goals are to dunk a basketball and bench press 350 lbs. I have also set financial and travel goals for myself. All these goals are handwritten and tacked to my wall so I see them every single day.\n\n**Motivation:** You need to take total responsibility and accountability for your happiness. If you are not happy, get off your ass and do something about it. Every single day when I wake up, my mindset is that I want the freedom to do what I want. For me, discipline equals freedom and keto is my discipline.\n\n**EDIT**: I few people requested a chart of my weight loss. I only have partial data from 63 weeks starting at about 400 lbs. I've seen some of you create amazing charts, but my poorly formatted one is posted below.\n\n**Weight Loss Chart** \\- [https://imgur.com/a/t2a9tkw](https://imgur.com/a/t2a9tkw)\n\n**EDIT #2**: Thank you for the gold!\n\n**EDIT #3**: Cleaned up a few typos and just want to say THANK YOU to everyone.

This was Dec 2016 / Jan 2017. \n\nIn March 2017 I was officially a BMI of 35 (Class II obese) at around 86kg (190lbs)! The first ten odd kilos disappeared as though through a wave of a magic wand, which was really, really heartening for the little obese girl who had been fat ever since I could remember. \n\n72.8kg (160lbs) took me until October 2017 to reach. That was under BMI 30, and this was the first instance to reduce me to literal tears. I never, ever thought I would get here, and I never, ever, EVER thought I would blow past this point. Soon after this my weight loss stalled HARD, and I took a break from losing for over a year to deal with things that cropped up in my personal life. I vowed I would come back and make a post when I hit 61.6kg (~136lbs), if I ever did.

{"title": "What (almost) 4 years of ketogenic dieting did to me.", "selftext": "(almost) old timer here looking to give the newbies some hope. Here is my story.\n\nI'm 35/M, 6ft. tall & coming up on 4 years of consistent ketogenic dieting. \nStarted out at 270lbs. Currently 168lbs.\n\nHere is how the plot developed for me:\n\n-- Year 0 --\n\nAfter deciding that my type 2 diabetes symptoms, cardiac issues, joint issues, general poor health, and having tried nearly every other diet to no avail wasn't working for me, I decided to take the plunge and try keto despite all the warnings that it would kill me. I set a goal for 200lbs.\n\nStarted tracking calories and running a 10-20% deficit and stuck religiously to 20g/carbs a day. The first month was very hard but i just kept doing it anyway. Immediately dropped 20lbs in the first month. Then 15, then 10, and by the end of the year, slowed down to about 5lbs/mo.\n\nChest pains and palpitations began to subside. Type 2 diabetes symptoms completely vanished. Knee pain went from a 9 to a 6. Brain fog went away, making me a more effective computer programmer. Lots of wins.\n\nAnd in general, I started feeling good about my future, knowing that there was a way to control my weight. Finally being handed the control knobs to my metabolism was a huge win.\n\nThe only negative was a random sharp pain under my ribcage that couldn't be explained by the keto community or medical professionals. The lower carb i went, the more it seemed to hurt. Still, i was not dismayed and KCKO'd.\n\n-- Year 1 --\n\nHit my 200lbs goal and got greedy and aimed for 180. My heart function became so good that the chest pains that haunted me since 18 were completely gone. ED went away and i started having good endurance in the sack. Started taking walks and biking again. \n\nThen, i took it a bit further and started physical therapy for my knees. The therapist had me doing exercises in the pool with people who were 60-90 years old, but i could barely manage to keep up - that's how bad i was. It was so painful and difficult that i broke into tears multiple times in front of everyone... but knee function improved significantly. I was at least able to walk a mile.\n\nOnce i could consistently walk and not live in terror of a heart attack, my confidence in myself really soared and my outlook on life changed. I started thinking about investing in myself long term, instead of just getting by. This was the biggest change. This lead me to tackle some debt in year 2 and start saving for retirement, because i felt like i was actually gonna survive my 30's.\n\nCompliments on my weight loss started rolling in, along with the usual questions of how i did it. I got preachy about keto and made a few converts.\n\nBut i wasn't really happy with my body yet. I still had some chub and i was out of shape. Loose skin everywhere too; but it was still an improvement.\n\n-- Year 2 --\n\nAt 180lbs here.\n\nPhysical therapy got me into the gym and i started going semi regularly and saw more gains in knee function and a little bit of visible muscle. I was extremely weak and started out pushing a mere 20-30lbs on most machines, which was extremely embarrassing around other men. But i figured everyone is a n00b once and just kept grinding for EXP.\n\nI began to get hooked to going to the gym. It gave me a boost in dude hormones and mental clarity and energy. I decided it was well worth the time.\n\nI got lazy with keto and went from 180lbs to 200lbs that year. Some of that weight was muscle but i had added some chub. I was dismayed by this backslide.\n\nI started working a physical job instead of a desk job and found that i could finally tolerate it, with some pain. My knees were healing, and being lighter lowered the load on them, and the pain level was down to a 5 or 4.\n\nMysterious under ribcage pain left me this year, too.\n\n-- Year 3 --\n\nI was having trouble getting the extra weight off and decided to try intermittent fasting with calorie restriction. 30lbs vanished as fast as it did when i started keto and i was amazed. At 170lbs, the muscle i'd put on had started to show. I started to look fit. The saggy skin began to fade in appearance.\n\nI stopped intermittent fasting at 170lbs because i did not want to look like a rail. Went back to lazy keto. \n\nWent from pushing 20-30lbs last year around to 90-120lbs. It was a very slow grind, because i had to work around popping and snapping joints. I took it slow and easy, and my joints improved. But I am no longer self conscious at the gym because i am pushing what average guys push, by now.\n\nMy joints and physical function had improved so much that i kept working a physical job. I biked and walked even more, even immediately after torturing my arms and legs at the gym. Knee pain is down to a 3 or 4, and days that i need to take anti inflammatories are very rare.\n\nI began to start liking my body this year, and obviously some other people do too, because random women started flirting with me. I still have an ugly belly and some loose skin, but you can't tell until i take my shirt off and the rest of me looks pretty good in contrast, so i'm not self conscious about that anymore. I can do surgery later if i like.\n\nI am 168lbs today, and feel 10 years younger. I feel like i've been given a new life by keto. Weight loss was just the beginning of all of this.\n\nAnd that being said, i'd like to thank this entire community for your posts, especially early on. I wouldn't have been able to do it without you guys. I am also amazed by the size of this sub; it only had ~20,000 subscribers when i started.

I started keto because I'd previously had mild success with Paleo and an online friend of mine went from tall and flabby to  super-ripped-holy-shit in less than a year with keto. I was a 31 year old, 5'5\", 215lb woman desperately trying to shed the baby weight I gained...in 2009. This morning I weighed myself and saw a number I haven't seen since 2004, my senior year of high school: 135. \n\n\nI screamed like a little girl because I never thought I'd accomplish this in *less than a year.* Holy shit, people! ELEVEN MONTHS!! From size 16 pants to 6. From XL shirts to small. Wow. \n\nKeto came easy to me as a lover of all things creamy and cheesy and veggie-laden; I took to it right away. I made mistakes along the way (AHEMELECTROLYTESAHEM), but never fell off the wagon. I went to weddings and parties and holiday gatherings (and had sweets constantly pushed on me because I'm a high school teacher and apparently we have FEED ME SUGAR tattooed on our foreheads) and politely declined every non-keto food that was offered to me. And you know what? It was not difficult.  I have no desire to cheat because not only have I been shedding pounds like it's going out of style, but I *genuinely love all the food I eat.* Keto fucking rules. \n\n(And so does IF...OMAD helped me shed these last 4 stubborn pounds, and 18:6 kept my skin tight after losing so much so quickly. Shout out to r/intermittentfasting!)\n\nI learned a lot about myself along the way. A few weeks ago I took the time to calculate my daily caloric intake pre-keto: I was consuming well over 2,000 calories, mostly carbs. I eat 1200-1300 now, so this realization made my stomach turn. My relationship with food has evolved from cosmic-level destructive to something beautiful that I can be proud of. It doesn't control me anymore. I'm free, and I'm loving it. \n\nI really don't think I would've been as wildly successful without this sub. I've learned so much here, you've all been insanely helpful and kind and supportive, and you've answered so many of the questions I've had along the way. I never thought I'd say this, but THANK YOU, REDDIT! \n\nI'm never going to stop eating keto. I sleep better, I have energy all the time, my mood and attitude have improved, I'm brimming with confidence in myself because I feel more attractive than I ever have in my life...hell, even my dentist said my teeth are healthier. Then he lectured me about the dangers of keto after I told him why, and I laughed. People are ignorant, and we should all brush them off (pun intended) because we know what we are doing: working our asses off to make our lives better. \n\nThank you for reading if you've gotten this far, and again, seriously, *thank you.* \n\nAlso, RIP my favorite sweatshirt. \ud83d\ude25 You'll always be around for cold lounging-around-the-house days! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ZZ6Y7QO", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9m13d0/so_i_finally_hit_my_goal_weight/", "created_utc": 1538872749.0, "score": 2012, "author": "ReverseLazarus", "num_comments": 250, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9m13d0/so_i_finally_hit_my_goal_weight/", "html_title": ""}

It's the bun, the French fries and the sugary drink that washes it all down, he said.\n\nNot that he condones eating excessive amounts of red meat, which may be a separate issue, he said. The main culprit, though, is industrial processing of food.\n\n\"The processed foods that people perceive to be high in saturated fats are in fact loaded with sugar, other refined carbohydrates and industrial seed oils (commonly known as vegetable oils) which are also now implicated in being pro-inflammatory and linked to heart disease, cancer and dementia,\" Malhotra said.

He's a pillar of this community and a wonderful example of how great of an impact positivity and encouragement can go.\n\nOne month ago, he offered his services in the form of motivational emails. I get a lot of email and spend my work days in front of a computer so I'm often not very good at reading or responding to personal emails but his are short and sweet and often exactly what I need to hear that day. It's nice to have little periodic reminders of encouragement.\n\nBut then he did something a little different.\n\nLast week, BigTex asked us for one thing we wanted to do this week that was new and/or special to us. I emailed him back that I had recently started biking and wanted to continue and that I also wanted to get into a bit of yoga. Of course he responded with wonderful words of encouragement. I asked him what *he* was going to do that was new and/or special to him and he said he'd let us know on Sunday.\n\n\nLast night/this morning, BigTex sent out an email and posted a video about what he had done this week. \n\n**This dude did everything we all said we wanted to do throughout the week so we wouldn't be doing it alone.** \n\nLet that sink in a bit.\n\n\nMaybe it doesn't seem like much, but to me it's incredible.

The fact that some stranger on the Internet went out of their way to make other strangers feel a little less alone is... It's a little difficult to explain but it's incredibly empowering.

During my first three years the office admin would always ask why I was drinking water and why I never took advantage of the free soda.  I would always politely explain that Diabetes ran in my family so I was watching my sugar.  \nAfter the third occurrence of her noticing me guzzling water instead of soda she asked once more why I wasn\u2019t taking advantage of the soda and I explained that there was just too much sugar in there for me.  She\u2019d rebuttal with how diet coke is healthy because it\u2019s sugar free.  I thought of spewing about how I didn\u2019t want to drink all of the chemicals in it so I told her I appreciate it, but that I prefer water and seltzer.  Well that was the buzz word for her.  Seltzer.  It\u2019s as if she felt like the mother hen in the office and there was a chicken she wasn\u2019t tending to.

{"title": "If you\u2019re morbidly obese, you will feel so much better sooner than you think", "selftext": "I was thinking about something earlier and I just wanted to share.\n\nOne of the most daunting aspects of losing weight when you have hundreds of pounds to lose is feeling like you are years away from your goals being met. The whole, \u201cit wasn\u2019t overnight that you got this big...\u201d trope.\n\nAnd while it is true that it takes a significant amount of time to get to your *final* destination, I want you to know that there are so many fulfilling milestones in between. \n\nIt\u2019s my hope that any person who is currently sitting at their lowest point mentally and physically, who feels like they have gone too far that nothing can be done anymore - I was that person. I was in that headspace. I was at rock bottom and hated myself. I remember thinking how I didn\u2019t even have a concept of the future. I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nI am a 5\u20194\u201d female who weighed over 300 pounds and more than half my body weight was fat. I was suicidal, I was afraid to leave my house, I was afraid to visit friends and family, my entire life was living in fear and hating who I became. The lows kept festering within me causing endless regret and effortless shame.\n\nAnd even though I had one spark of hope left that said I\u2019m going to try to change this one last time, I thought I wouldn\u2019t be \u201chappy\u201d for years to come. If ever.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was that I noticed an almost immediate change in my mental health only weeks in. With every 5 pounds I felt accomplished, even if it was just water weight. With every meal prep I felt accomplished. \n\nMy confidence from keto seeped into other areas of my life and I started making more and more changes. With every exercise I felt accomplished. Every shower (I was bad about putting them off), every new habit like making the bed in the morning, being more active for my pet, the list goes on. \n\nI really do feel like keto has balanced my mood and my mind in a way that I have never experienced before.\n\nI felt like an addict to sugar, to emotional eating, and to binge eating. If you told me that I would feel as good and as confident as I do at my current weight, which is still 120 pounds away from my \u201cgoal weight\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t believe you.\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning without being bloated/nauseated I feel good, right now. When I am not exhausted doing daily tasks or running errands I feel good, right now. When I can do more reps and heavier weight in my exercises I feel good, right now.\n\nEven though I\u2019m nowhere near my end goals, I feel so good about so many things, and in general, **right now**.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that says self-esteem is based on the promises you keep to yourself, and I really have come to believe that. Everyone has a \u201cday one\u201d. That combined with keto really makes me feel healthier than I have ever been. And to anyone lurking who needs a sign to start, I hope this can be it for you.\n\nIf you are at rock bottom, please don\u2019t see your goals as unattainable and impossible. I promise, you will feel so much better sooner than you think. I believe in you.\n\nEdit: thank you for all of the awards and kind comments. I truly wish the best for each and every one of you.

{"title": "One Year, 100lbs, and one Social Media Post", "selftext": "I have been pretty quiet on any of my personal social media in my whole journey of choosing a different life style. This weekend I hit a large goal in the actual numbers of weight loss. I leave for a trip to Iceland with high school friends next week, and I wanted to hit 100lbs lost before I did that. While social media posts are obviously not the most important part of this journey, I finally felt compelled to share the past year. Below is the post I made on my personal accounts. I make no mention of keto because that is a mixed bag, but really its not the most important part anyway. Either way, I'm just so happy to have changed my life.\n\nA year ago, I was a 23 year old with chronic back pain, persistent arthritis in my knees, overwhelming amounts of anxiety, and a digestive system that wanted to see me die. It was right around this time last year when I decided I was tired of those things.\n\nIn one night I decided to overhaul my entire life. I\u2019m forever thankful that I did because I cannot imagine spending another full year the way that I felt.\n\nI find it incredibly important to note that I did not start on this journey looking for any change to my physical appearance or for a drop in the scale. I have been fat for over 15 years. I am still fat. I don\u2019t like the narrative of \u201cI was so depressed and mad at how I looked so I changed it.\u201d Please love your bodies at WHATEVER stage your body is in. Have I ever been the picture of health? Definitely not. Does that mean I shouldn\u2019t love my body? Definitely not. I changed my life BECAUSE I loved my body where I was, and I wanted to treat it better.\n\nThis has been a pretty monumental year for me in personal growth (and shrinkage). The scale has now dropped 100lbs, and I love my body no more or no less than I did 100 lbs ago. However, because of the changes I think my body will last me a little longer.\n\nI had two pretty eye opening experiences this weekend. I found my senior prom dress, and tried it on. I laced it up as tight as the dress allows, but still if I let go of the sides it fell off of me. Also, I found a Hogwarts shirt at Walmart. Shirts like these are not often made in larger plus sizes, or their prices are astronomical. This weekend though, I got to buy a Hogwarts shirt that fits.\n\nP.S. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a haircut in the past year, so there\u2019s some nice growth too lol.\n\n[What you\u2019re all waiting for ](https://imgur.com/a/HhCfv7i)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/cvowny/one_year_100lbs_and_one_social_media_post/", "created_utc": 1566830177.0, "score": 1988, "author": "Myrandableu", "num_comments": 168, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/cvowny/one_year_100lbs_and_one_social_media_post/", "html_title": ""}

I thought Atkins was for insane people before I heard enough of the science to realize it isn't *all* wackadoo.  \n**Month 1:** I ate according to the r/keto 1-week-meal plan.  \n**Month 2-3:** I focused on macros only and went for walks during my lunch hour.  \n**Month 3:** I continued watching macros but added some light running and pull-up 'attempts', my first exercise in years.  \n**Month 4-9:** I only closely watched my carb intake but I had a general awareness of total calorie consumption. I started running one or two 5ks a week. I got a gym membership and went about once a week for weight-lifting and cardio (in the winter).  \n**Month 10-12:** I started an even lazier form of keto where I was only generally aware of carb intake. I added cheat days to my diet to enjoy some carbs*. I balanced those out with two fasting days during the week (Monday and Wednesday) where I consumed only ~600 calories in the mornings and water-fasted the rest of the day. I generally upped each exercise I enjoyed and discarded those I didn't. I read a lot about body-weight fitness and cancelled my gym membership to run outside in the nice weather. \n  \n*Weird tip: Whenever a craved a specific food, I added it to a list on my phone. I called it my food bucket list -- all of the stuff I could eat once my body was where I wanted it to be. I slowly realized the list wasn't as exciting as I once thought it was. I still followed through on the bucket list promise though. I started adding cheat days/weekends to consume those things again. None of them were as good as I remembered (except cereal with milk). I'm finally through the list and ready to restrict myself again, knowing those foods don't own me.\n  \nLastly and most importantly, I've learned what works for me are more binary restrictions and controls (or close to binary). Fasting for a day or cutting out an entire group of food is way easier for me than casual moderation. I cheat with most forms of moderation. With these restrictions I can make goals, check statuses, and point to the exact failures. I've been able to then loop back in exceptions and psuedo-moderation with that general binary framework in place. It has worked so far for me, and I hope it continues.\n\nAnyway, I hope that might be helpful for someone.

{"title": "30 months in on Keto, let's chat about it.", "selftext": "Okay so I started this whole thing 08/28/18. I was 360lb and suffering from a pretty severe binging disorder. I was sick all of the time, and my body hurt constantly like it was under too much pressure. I had skin issues. And allergic reactions to foods that now give me no trouble. I would bloat constantly, and I was so freaking hungry. I also really hated myself. I was pretty huge into bopo, thinking if I was positive enough and confident enough about my body, I would finally love it. Turns out thats not the way it worked for me. I just fell further into my binge eating and depression. Encasing myself in the armor of fat. I was legitimately numb in some spaces, because, I assume, I didn't have enough nerve endings to cover my mass. Idk. Thats a guess. \n\nSo in August of '18 my best friend sat me down and told me she loved me, and I was cute as hell just the way I was, but if I was really unhappy I needed to change it, or be quiet. She was just about ready to start keto herself, But had a big life event to prepare for first. So I agreed to start that very day. \n\nI was 360lb, wearing a 5x top. And 4x bottoms that were (clearly) too small and stretched way too tight across me. My hips were 65inches around, and my waist was 55 inches. I could barely put the seat belt on in the front seat, and backseat belts never fit. Planes were a nightmare tbh. \n\nI got to 360lb because I have a binge eating disorder. I would eat 2-3 cheeseburgers, large fries, cokes, cookies, cakes, those little glazed pies at the grocery store? I ate THOUSANDS of calories every day. Donuts? By the dozen. I was absolutely lost in that sickness. Nothing made me feel good. The sugar barely tasted good anymore. When I was younger, sweets made me feel good for a long time. But in the midst of a 5 year binge... I was barely getting any joy while the sugar was on my tongue, let alone once I was done eating. So I just ate all of the time instead. It was... a lot. \n\nWhile gaining all of that weight I tried to love myself. I bought clothes that looked good in my head (reality is soooooo different), and enjoyed my cleavage and made people believe I loved being fat. Fat was beautiful dangit. And I was ready to make sure everyone believed it. Even if I didn't.\n  It's hard to love yourself superficially. You can't just throw clothes on your body and tell it you love it. It knows you're lying. You know you're lying. Just like you can't buy your kids off, you can't buy yourself off. I had to be completely honest with myself. I was in so much pain. Inside. Outside. Emotional. Physical. I hurt in every way. I was screaming inside for help. So I took stock. Where was the pain coming from. What made it worse, what made it better? \n\nObviously at first everything made it worse. I was 360 pounds! Much too large for a 5 foot 6 inch human!! But, Even though I was still hurting ,and also now without my comfort food escape, I was seeing changes. Benefits. Small ones at first. My swelling went down. Headaches lessened in frequency,  food tasted good again, my temper chilled out, and it wasn't unbearably hot all of the time.  Sweets were neccessary to me for the first 6 months or so. I was just making mug cakes and protein drinks and baking all the keto things. I actually lost my first 100 pounds during that initial phase of healing. 0\n\nOnce I hit 100 pounds gone, the pain had lessened to such a degree that I could do things like zumba and the treadmill! It made life easier in a lot of ways. But also much harder because I was ready for my skinny body. LOL, yall know what I mean. 6 months isn't long at all. And wanting my body NOW was very Veruka of me. But I forced myself into patience. The weightloss slowed down like we expected it to, but I still got below 200lb mark. It was incredible. ONEDERLAND! I'd made it!\n\nNow here is where the slow down becomes fierce. We are a year and a half in. I'm ready. And taking my fitness to the next level. And stallllllllllll\n\nI Stalled for 3 months before BLOOP suddenly 190. Then stallllllllll for 3 more months and blooP! 185! Then stalllllllllllllllllllll and it didn't move. For all of 2020 I was stuck at 185. \n\nThen suddenly January 2021comes and BLOOP 177. \n\nHahaha!! \n\nI have now lost 183 pounds. I weigh 177pounds. \n\nI LOST MORE THAN I WEIGH!! I DID THAT!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHH the excitement is too much. Honestly. \n\nAnywhoodles, here are my comparisons. Yes I look like a different person. But if you go look at all of my posts you'll see someone says that every time.

Thanks a lot for so many nice comments, I honestly was not expecting this post to be seen by so many people.\n\nAs there were a lot of questions, I figured it will be best if I write something more about my keto journey and try answering you here.\n\nPlease, bear in mind that whatever works for me doesn't necessarily mean it will work for you. We're all different.\n\n\nF/23/5'2\"\n\n\nThe first step in losing my weight was way before I even made a decision about the weight loss. As I've already mentioned in a comment below, it all came down to having a better relationship with myself. I finally, after many years, started realising that I like myself and I genuinely want the best for me. I started learning to observe my emotions, what really makes me happy, brings me joy, excitement, which moments in my life are making me feel proud about myself and what can I do to have more moments like that. I also started observing my negative emotions, eg. what makes me feel down/anxious/worthless(!)/powerless and and if I can find a way to change whatever is causing that. I started prioritising my self-care and wellbeing.\n\nLong story short, after implementing some changes, I also started implementing routines into my life. Started with complex skincare routine, then added daily vitamin and collagen supplementation, language classes 4x/week, daily stretching etc. and THIS is what I think helped me a lot. I realized that  1) I am finally able to do something for me long term 2) it REALLY makes me feel good about myself and I want to keep feeling that way\n\nI knew that my weight was stopping me from doing a lot of things that I wanted to do + I wouldn't feel as comfortable in social situations. I always had this feeling that with the weight that I had I was just not who I'm supposed to be (???)\n\nSo I started with keto. [mid April 2020]\n\n[!] DIET:\n\nWell, my first week was just IF to kick-start the whole thing, then I went on keto + IF. \n\nI'm trying to stick to 1200/1300kcal a day.\n\nI would most of the times try to do 2 meals a day:\n\nFirst meal around 11/12:\n\nUsually 2/3 bacon rashes, a fried egg or 2, chestnut mushrooms + veggies like spinach, wild rocket, olives, tomatoes etc. Sometimes I'd add mayo, sometimes cheese etc. Most of the days my breakfast would look pretty much the same as I was simply enjoying it \ud83e\udd37\n\nMy second meal would be around 17/18:\n\nEither steak or some creamy chicken, broccoli, a lot of veggies again, maybe a salad with king prawns.\n\nIf I feel like snacking on something, I snack on cheese and olives or oven baked pepperoni with jalapenos and cheese.\n\nIf I crave something sweet I usually go for low-carb ice cream, sometimes low-carb peanut bars. It's not a clean keto, but it's good for my mental health as it makes me feel like I'm basically not on a diet.\n\nBy the end of the first month I did 5 days of egg fast, but I wouldn't say I had some bigger results, the weight was dropping at usual pace.\n\n\nI drink alcohol once a week - it's usually a red wine, but sometimes I go for gin/vodka/whiskey and that's the only times that I drink soda.\n\nI drink a lot of water, sometimes I add lime/lemon/mint/cucumber for taste.\n\nOnce a day I drink water with collagen to help my skin with weight loss shock and just help it in general.\n\nI did cheat during my diet, but although I cheated, I never binged. So even if I had something that was not keto friendly, the portion was never big. And I wasn't obsessing over it. I wanted it, I had a bit of it and it wasn't the end of the world.\n\nI do not obsess over food. Keto was an easier option for me, as even without a diet, I would never buy bread unless some sandwich to-go. I don't like potatoes, I find pasta and rice tasteless and although I would be eating them before, I'm not craving them. \n\nI like cheese, pepperoni, bacon, mayo etc so on keto I barely feel like I'm on a diet. Especialy since there's so many tasty meals you can have.\n\n\n\n[!] EXERCISES\n\nAs gyms still not reopened here where I live, I use some YouTube videos to excercise - one time it's tabata, one time something targeting abs + core, then legs + bum etc. I have dumbbell and plates that I use for excercise. I additionally do yoga and care about the whole body flexibility. I excercise 4x a week and stretch most of the days \n\nIt's easier for me to gain muscles as it's more of a regaining - I used to excercise on and off - although in the last few years it was rather off - since I was little, so the muscle memory is there.\n\nIf anyone's interested in YT videos I use you can PM me, but I watch them in a few languages. But I don't think that should be a big issue.\n\nI used to do skipping rope and it was great, but with that my boobs would disappear way quicker.\n\n\n\n\n\nI take magnesium, potassium, calcium, vit D And vit B complex.. everyday.\n\n\nI do not know what my BF% is.\n\n\nI had a month or two when I struggled with insomnia, but I think it was a mix of keto and my life situation at that point. Now I sleep like I used to before going on a diet.\n\n\nI hope I didn't forget about anything, although I probably did \ud83d\ude05", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/hrlww8/pics_finally_a_normal_bmi_healthy_relationship/", "created_utc": 1594812710.0, "score": 1942, "author": "kolki123", "num_comments": 176, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/hrlww8/pics_finally_a_normal_bmi_healthy_relationship/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One year on keto. Hit my goal weight!!", "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/aJoymCG](https://imgur.com/a/aJoymCG)\n\n  \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with my weight my entire life. The first time I remember it ever being an issue though, was in the 3rd grade when a substitute teacher had the entire class weigh themselves and write the numbers up on the chalkboard, and me being the first name on the list with the highest weight (a piss poor way to teach children how to calculate averages, medians, etc, in my opinion\u2026 but, it is what it is) In the 7th grade, I remember a classmate asking me \u201cwhat are you down to now, 240 pounds?\u201d before mooing at me and slamming my hand in my locker door. That struck me hard, the irony being that I had been doing the military diet at the time, and that actually was what I was down to.\n\nIn high school, I developed a severe case of anorexia, and became addicted to going to the gym. I ate only an apple a day and worked out for 3 hours every single day for about a year. I lost 140 pounds in that time, but, I also lost most of my hair, stopped having my monthly cycle and was being turned in to my guidance counselor at school regularly. I didn\u2019t care, I thought I looked good (for the record, I did not. My senior pictures are scary to look at now) That all changed though, the first time I \u201callowed\u201d myself to eat a cheeseburger. McDonalds may very well have saved my life, but, unfortunately that got me started mindlessly bingeing food, and by the time I graduated, I had put on so much weight that I had to walk across the stage to accept my diploma with my gown completely open, because I was barely able to get it around me, let alone get it buttoned up.\n\nThat was 20 years ago. Since then, my weight has gone up and down through fad diets, pregnancy, every eating disorder imaginable, moves, marriage, divorce, and all the other things life threw at me. I hit my highest weight of 335 in 2017, and that was when I decided enough was enough, and I went on a diet program that I had seen on TV years and years ago, and had had some success with in the past (I literally ate nothing but lettuce and canned tuna, baked chicken and steamed vegetables with no salt, no, butter, nothing) I did manage to lose about 50 pounds doing that, but, I basically hated my life, and eating this way got my eating disorders going again and spiraling out of control. \n\nI started Keto on December 26th 2018 after a close friend made me realize that what I was doing to myself was not healthy. It finally sunk in that I didnt want to live this way anymore. I weighed 280 pounds. On December 29th, almost exactly one year later, I hit my goal weight of 160. I\u2019m still on keto, and I plan to stay on keto forever. I don\u2019t ever want to go back to where I was. But now, I\u2019m more relaxed about my calories, and am focusing on building strength. \n\nI\u2019d love to be able to say that the last year was perfect. That I never ever went over on my carbs or calories. That I always hit my protein macro. That I drank a gallon of water every single day, and never missed a workout. But, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve slipped. I\u2019ve gotten lazy. I\u2019ve made mistakes. But, keto has taught me to be mindful of what I put into my body, and how I treat myself. Even more than just aesthetics, I like feeling healthy and strong. I like that I love myself enough to take care of my body and my mind. I\u2019m learning that I\u2019m not perfect, and its ok. So now, when I have a bad day, or two, or three\u2026I don\u2019t rip myself apart. I don\u2019t view myself as a failure. I just dust myself off and keep moving forward. \n\nSo, to everyone in the keto community, thank you so much for all of your guidance. Your posts and stories have kept me going. And now I hope I can inspire others the way you all have inspired me. And to anyone just starting out, or thinking about starting, I know sometimes it can feel daunting. Its easy to get discouraged when you don\u2019t lose 5 pounds every single week. Or when you go for 2 or 3 or 4 weeks and the scale doesn\u2019t budge. Its normal. Its ok! Just keep going. Time really does move a lot faster than you think. A year from now, you\u2019ll be glad you started today.\n\n<3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ekcgac/one_year_on_keto_hit_my_goal_weight/", "created_utc": 1578227505.0, "score": 1933, "author": "ungodlymayo", "num_comments": 103, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/ekcgac/one_year_on_keto_hit_my_goal_weight/", "html_title": ""}

I was morbidly obese, had been overweight/obese my entire life, and I was done with it. I was going to do whatever it took to lose the weight.  \n* January 30th, 2018: I was laying in bed, staring at my ceiling, and thinking \u201cWell, it\u2019s been one month. I haven\u2019t done anything different. I\u2019m still a lazy fat fuck, and I\u2019ll be the same lazy fat fuck for 2018.\u201d But after a few minutes, something clicked in my head.  Just because I let January go by didn\u2019t mean that I had to give up for the whole year. I wasn\u2019t sure how much weight someone could safely lose in 11 months, but I thought, \u201cFuck it, let\u2019s just put in a solid effort and try.\u201d \n* January 31, 2018: I fasted. \n\nI fasted for a couple days or so, drinking water and researching diets. After putting in a tremendous amount of time reading NIH studies on diets and nutrition physiology, I came to a few conclusions: \n\n1. We\u2019re eating too much sugar in the modern Western world.\n2. Everything I was taught in grade school about a food pyramid is completely horse shit.\n3. There are many well-studied diets today, and all of them *probably* work if you actually stick to them and don\u2019t cheat. \n\nI chose Keto.  I chose Keto because I was certain that I could stick to it without cheating. I am the type of person who can give up bread, sweets, fruit, pasta, and other carbs *if* I can have an extra serving (or two!) of bacon, sausage, steak, and ribs.\n\nTo make a long post short*er*... Keto worked for me. It worked for me so well that I was scared, and so I saw my doctor after a month. I had lost an average of 1.0 lbs per day during that first month. He told me to eat when I was hungry, and to make sure that I was reaching my recommended daily amounts (RDA\u2019s) of micronutrients. Well I was already keeping myself stuffed. While I had not counted calories during that first month, I did begin logging everything with the My Fitness Pal app (free version). \n\nI was a little concerned about my micros/vitamins. After a little more digging, I came across /r/KetoChow and /u/ChrisBair.  Keto Chow was the micronutrient \u201chack\u201d that I was searching for. It works, it\u2019s a great product, but I\u2019m not here to shill for him.\n\nI am here to speak to everyone who made the goal of losing the weight in 2019, but who never took that next step: **It\u2019s not too late.**\n\n* Don\u2019t wait to begin Keto tomorrow. \n* Don\u2019t wait to begin Keto once you\u2019ve finished the leftover pasta in the refrigerator. \n* Don\u2019t wait to begin Keto until after the Super Bowl because you\u2019ve already committed to bringing brownies for the office party.\n\nIf you wait to begin Keto, you will have an even better excuse next week than you do right now.  That\u2019s just the way things go. There will *always* be a better excuse tomorrow. Always. There\u2019s a great Chinese proverb, very widely known, \u201cThe best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time to plant a tree is right now.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m *specifically* speaking to you right now. Plant your tree right now.

{"title": "One Year Update (NSFW Pics)", "selftext": " *I\u2019ve been writing this post for a few days, trying to figure out exactly what I want to say. I\u2019m still not sure, so if it sounds like I\u2019m rambling, it\u2019s because I am. Several days of thoughts combined in to one post. Sorry.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday was my one-year anniversary of starting keto (this time around). It\u2019s the longest that I\u2019ve ever stuck with a diet and I\u2019ve seen amazing results. Consider this a shout out to everyone on this subreddit for being an amazing support group. I try to be active and offer support when I can, but I never really know what to say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s been 365 days since I\u2019ve gone a day with more than 15g of carbs. Here is what I\u2019ve learned and some advice that I want to give to anyone who is just starting. Please keep in mind this is only what has worked for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Don\u2019t cheat**. Looking back, this is what has killed every diet that I have ever been on without question. One cookie, one piece of pizza, one whatever. That builds up and ruined my resistance because junk food is addicting. Now, I get sick if I eat too much sugar or carbs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **Pictures**. This is the absolute most important thing for me. I took starting pictures of myself and then some more randomly throughout the year, and again yesterday. Seeing what I used to look like versus what I look like now is the single most motivating thing I could imagine. I\u2019ve conditioned myself that when I get depressed over a stall or feel like I can\u2019t continue the diet, I open those pictures to and compare them. It gives me an amazing renewed sense of purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Self-image**. I have the most warped version of body dysmorphia anyone could be cursed with. At my highest weight, I could look at myself and think \u201cYeah, I\u2019m overweight, but it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not that bad.\u201d Now, I can barely look in the mirror without being disgusted at myself. Yes, I still have weight to lose, but the difference is insane. I should be proud of myself. If it wasn\u2019t for friends and family telling me how much better I look, I probably would\u2019ve quit again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **Scales**. I hate scales. They never give good news. I made the mistake of creating a habit of weighing myself every morning before I go to work. Don\u2019t do this, your weight changes too much. Once a week is fine and probably better for your sanity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. **Help**. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Whether it\u2019s friends, family, or me. I will offer any advice that I can. I will listen to you if you are frustrated and need to vent. Weight loss is an intense and stressful journey that you may not be able to handle by yourself. Don\u2019t let it frustrate you in to stopping before you meet your goals. If you say you have no one to talk to, you\u2019re wrong.

{"title": "52 Weeks, 52 lbs. Today's my ketoversary! You can do it too!", "selftext": "I just want to say thanks to this sub for all the knowledge and inspiration over the past year. I started keto one year ago at my highest weight- 184lbs as a 5'3\" 29 year old woman. I was obese and after years of yo-yo dieting of only a few lbs here and there, I thought I'd never lose the weight and was doomed to be fat forever. Then I found keto and this sub, saw all the awesome before and after pictures, and decided that I needed to make a change NOW. The hardest part of changing to a keto lifestyle was definitely the first month, but now I can't imagine living any other way. One year later, and I'm down 52 lbs, and back to a normal BMI for the first time since I was a teenager. I've still got some more to go, but I think I've got it down enough to share a bit of what I've picked up in the past year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings I've learned after a year eating keto-\n\n1. IT GETS EASIER OVER TIME! Your tastes will change. Get through the first two weeks to a month and you will be cruising. You're going through sugar withdrawal like a carb addict and if you give in then you're going to set yourself back. Now that I've been eating this way for so long, I can taste the tiniest bit of sugar in things and it is totally unappealing to me.\n2. Weigh your ingredients and portions! You think you know what an oz looks like!? YOU DON'T. When I first broke out my food scale I was SHOCKED at how much I was overeating. No wonder I was obese, I was eating 3 serving sizes when I thought I was having one! If you don't have a kitchen scale, get one and use it. You still have to count calories if you want to lose weight on keto. And recalculate your calorie intake after every 10lbs because you're going to have to eat less as you weigh less. I track everything in my fitbit and myfitnesspal apps.\n3. Learn what replacements to make and get in your diet. I was and still am a big baker. I found that Lakanto Monkfruit sweetener is the best tasting and I can still enjoy sweets as long as I make them. Pork rinds instead of potato chips and crush them up as a \"breading\" for other dishes. Cooking is going to be your new hobby so get good at it.\n4. Everyone will ask you how you lost the weight and then look at you like you have 3 heads when you say you stopped eating sugar and carbs and count calories. I still tell people how I do it but at the end of the day they have to make the decision for themselves to change their diet.\n5. You'll lose the most weight in the beginning, then it's a grind to lose the rest, and you'll lose slower as you get to a normal BMI. I started out losing around 2lbs/week and now it's slowed down to around .6lbs/week now that I'm at a normal BMI. Weight loss isn't linear, but it should be a downward trend. I weigh more/stall during ovulation and premenstruation, but it all evens out over time. I've never \"plateaued\" for more than 3 weeks and I think it's because I am strict with tracking calories. Whooshes are real too.\n6. Body dysmorphia is a thing. I didn't think I was THAT fat at my highest weight, and some days recently I feel just as fat as when I started. Take before/after pictures so you can remind yourself where you started.\n7. Sticking to it is about DISCIPLINE- not motivation. Throw motivation out the window, it's a trap and fleeting. You don't eat more than 20g net carbs per day, you count your calories, and that's the end of the story. You don't need motivation to stick to the plan, you need to just do it. Don't make excuses for yourself to eat like shit, and don't lie to yourself about what you ate. It'll get easier as you become more disciplined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this has already gotten long, so here's my before/current progress pic: [https://imgur.com/a/u1ocqkE](https://imgur.com/a/u1ocqkE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd for the cooks out there- here's my personal document of recipes that I add to periodically. It's mostly desserts because I cook off the cuff. Some are jacked from other keto sites but most are edited and I'm not trying to make money off of this stuff.

{"title": "Dieting for Disney, Completed", "selftext": "Hi all, thought I'd take the chance to tell my story. I've read along for the last 8 months and it always seemed that someone would post an update whenever I needed to see someone else succeed to motivate me, so this is my turn to pay it forward.\n\nM/38/6ft\n\nI had my annual checkup in December, and I was surprised by how much I'd let myself go. I weighed in at 318, my highest weight ever, and worse, I was beginning to show signs of high blood pressure for the first time in my life. I decided I needed to try to lose weight before it did permanent damage.\n\nIn addition, we have been saving for a few years to take a family vacation to Disney World. From our last trip in 2013, I knew how uncomfortable walking around the parks carrying 50 extra pounds could be. I couldn't imagine carrying that 50, and another 50 on top, around the parks in the Florida heat. Not to mention the struggle trying to fit in some of the safety harnesses. I felt that I owed it to my daughters (9-year-old twins, and a 4-year-old, all named after princesses) to get in better shape for the trip. That gave me 8 months. I wanted to lose at least 60 lbs, so I'd be the same size I was when we last went to Disney World 5 years ago. \"Dieting for Disney\" became my mantra, and one my kiddos easily latched onto, providing me with positive reinforcement. \"Daddy's dieting for our trip to Disney World!\"\n\nI started on January 3rd with little-to-no direction. I'd done Adkins in the past and lost as much as 50lbs, so I started there again. But, I quickly remembered why I couldn't make the diet work long term. I've always been a picky eater, and 7 days a week of baked chicken and green beans grew tiresome quickly. Three weeks in, and I was already trying to find reasons to have a \"cheat meal\" whenever possible.\n\nWhen I get bored in the wee hours of the night, I browse r/all. I don't remember the post, but I saw someone's victory thread on r/loseit, where they mentioned that they lost their weight via keto. I read up on the diet, found the keto board, and gave it a try. I've never been big on counting anything when I eat (hence the reason I broke 300lbs), but this time everything seemed to click. I found the keto recipes board and decided, if I was already miserable with what I was eating, I might as well try new things. I don't know if it was the diet that changed my taste buds, if it was getting older, or if I finally reached a point in my life where I was ready for tastes other than meat, cheese, potatoes, and bread. I experimented with new foods... and it worked. I learned to make a basic cream sauce, and that, more than anything, drove my first month of success.  I tried broccoli (covered in cream sauce) and fried mushrooms (covered in cream sauce), until I eventually learned to like both on their own. I learned to slice up and saut\u00e9 red peppers. I caramelized onions. I eat celery stalks like they're candy canes. I stopped looking at this as a diet and began to see it as an excuse to try new things.\n\nFour months into this, I read up on intermittent fasting. Since keto meant I was never hungry anyway, I gave it a try. I went 16/8. It was a breeze. A week later I went 20/4. It was so easy I finally went OMAD, and I've been there for two-three months now. It really turbo charged the weight loss and I plowed through the last 40lbs with ease.\n\nWhich brings me to today. We go to Disney World soon, so this past weekend was my final weigh-in before the trip.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3tkzY1v\n\nJanuary 3rd: 318lbs. August 25th: 204lbs. 114 pounds lost in under 8 months.\n\nI've started to add carbs in this week in preparation for the trip, I want to enjoy the Food and Wine festival, but I plan to return to low carb eating habits when we get back.\n\nThings that worked:\nHaving a super supportive wife and kids to motivate me.\n\nHaving a goal other than a number on the scale. Whenever I felt tempted to quit I thought about how much fun I wanted my girls to have in Disney World. I didn't want to slow them down because daddy needed to stop and sit a spell every 50 steps. \n\nDiet soda. If I ever got hungry, this helped. I couldn't get into Lacroix, but y'all do y'all.\n\nFun cardio. Instead of running around a track I play basketball or swim.\n\nr/ketorecipes. There are so many good things you can eat on this diet. Be adventurous with your food.\n\nDiscovering Penzey's spices. I bought some Foxpoint seasoning for the Christmas sale and love it so much I went back for more... and more. My father-in-law had to build me a new spice rack to handle all the spices I've since bought.\n\nCheese. I'm convinced that loving cheese in all its forms is the secret to keto.\n\nTLDR: Was fat. Tried keto. Now not fat.\n\nP.S. If any of you work for/with the Mouse and want to spread some pixie dust, I'd totally let you use this for any purposes, nefarious or otherwise, in exchange for Mickey's Not-So-Scary-Halloween tickets. \n\nEdit: Cream sauce recipe below: https://old.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9ay6q3/dieting_for_disney_completed/e4z4xkb/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9ay6q3/dieting_for_disney_completed/", "created_utc": 1535456688.0, "score": 1875, "author": "travishall456", "num_comments": 173, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9ay6q3/dieting_for_disney_completed/", "html_title": ""}

This was an exciting time for me and my wife wanted to get a picture of me leaving for school on my first day. At that time I overall felt like crap and had zero energy.

But, first I want to express my sincere gratitude to this subreddit and to all of your brave and amazing success stories, they are highly motivating and kept me focused on this WOE!  Also a huge shout out to the Lovely and Feisty Keto Bitches over at r/xxketo4U2 who keep me entertained, and accountable in my quest for Health!  I live there on a Daily basis getting my dose of support and reality!\n\nI started out on my Keto Journey on April 1, 2018 weighing 303 lbs.  I am currently in the low 190's, my lowest weight being 191.6 lbs in the last couple weeks but right now I'm loving being solidly in Onederland, a place I have not visited in over 20 years!   I went from a Size 24 to a size 12/14!   My goal is to get down to 175-180 lbs.  In the beginning I was losing 10 lbs a month like clockwork and now it has slowed to 2-4 lbs a month and I'm just fine with that! \n\nWhen I first started Keto, I logged everything in Carb Manager the first 6 months, but now I focus mostly on just eating whole Keto foods and keeping my net carbs under 20g. Occasionally, I will go back to tracking and logging to sharpen the saw.  I love to cook so this has made food prep and variety very pleasant.  I eat mostly grilled meats, eggs, cheese, avocado, bacon, sausages, canned tuna, and vegetables like broccoli, brussels, swiss chard, green beans, red bells and mushrooms.  I have never made things like Mug Cakes or Fathead Pizza, not because they don't look tasty AF in all your photos but because for me they represent a slippery slope.  I was never a sweets eater anyway, but I did consume more than my fair share of Pasta, Potatoes and Rice dishes pre-Keto. I could put the hurt on a Chinese Buffet.   I do love to make Cauliflower Risotto or Mash to provide a \"comfort food\" feel to things like Cracklin' Chicken or a Green Chile Braised Beef Brisket.  I have never been bored with Keto Foods! I don't do cheat days and I've never fallen off the wagon. But if I did, I would just KCKO.\n\nAfter a couple months on Keto, I noticed my appetite dropping to the point that I no longer wanted a lunchtime meal.  This is when I started playing around with just two meals a day and IF.  Typically, I will have my first and largest meal at 10 am and then a smaller meal around 5 or 6 pm.   I also regularly consume Alcohol and my drink of choice is a Gin Snack.....Gin with Lime LaCroix and a squeeze of Lemon.\n\nAfter about three months, my energy levels surged so much that I started swimming laps in my community pool and worked my way up to about 1200 yards most days of the week just doing slow laps.  Then I started doing some hiking in our beautiful Southern Arizona Canyons and hiking is now my \"thing\" getting in upwards of 30 and sometimes 40 miles a week.  I love particularly hilly and challenging terrain!  I also Volunteer at a local Hospital and get in lots of steps.  I try to \"move\" all the time.  I also credit my physical activity with Recomp Benefits because at my age, I have never had an ass or thighs this small, even with previous weight loss endeavors.  I am also pleased with the lack of loose skin (Yes, I have some but it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be!!) and I credit this to IF and Autophagy. \n\nNSV's have been plenty but my favorite of all time was being able to sit in an Airplane Seat and buckle the seat belt!  This brought tears to my eyes, I was so proud of myself.  My family has been very supportive and when I am back home visiting my relatives, they totally embrace the Keto Meals I prepare for them.  My neighbors are also asking me about Keto and I'm starting to coach some of them to kick start their journey.  I love \"Prancing\" in clothes that didn't use to fit, and I am dating again.   Those are just a few.....as we all know the NSV's are plentiful in following a Keto Lifestyle.\n\nThank you again for reading my story and I hope that it inspires others to embrace Keto.  Seriously, if I can do this, so can you, I have struggled my entire life with my weight, losing some only to gain it back with interest. I felt like a total frump and now I feel fabulous and attractive!   Keto WORKS IF YOU STICK TO THE PLAN and your individual plan is what works for you, just keep those carbs in check....watch carb creep and sneaky carbs hidden in packaged foods.  Focus on real, whole foods, ebmbrace the fat and live your best life!!!!

{"title": "A BigTexan Onederland", "selftext": "***Onederland***.  A magical word for so many people.  But for BigTex, ***Onederland*** is a different thing.  \"Big framed\" is the phrase older folks use to describe my body.  Not talking about the fat, but the size of my frame.  The width of my shoulders for example.  Another phrase folks use is \"big boned\".  Alas, I am just a big dude.  And handsome :)           \n\n\n\nWith my size, ***Onederland*** is not really in my wheelhouse.  If I were to weigh 199 pounds, I would look plain sickly.  Furthermore, it is not a weight class that I aspire to reaching.  I would rather be 240 and somewhat muscular, because as an older guy, I value strength over thinness.   No skinny jeans for me :)\n\n\n\nWhen I began this way of eating, I was looking at needing to lose 353 pounds.  That my friends is a damn big sip of water.  A big damn boulder standing in the middle of my path.  I had some good luck in the beginning.  Then, I found this sub a little bit later and I credit so many of the people on here for helping me keep my resolve.  For helping me chip away on that 353 pound boulder.  And for you newbies, please understand that it was some damn work for the people of r/keto to lift a 590 pound man.  But lift me up they did.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy goal weight is 240 pounds.  My high school graduation weight.  I was damn healthy.   Strong as hell.  Fit.  Desirable.  I realize that in my 50's, at 240 pounds, I won't be as strong.  I won't be as fit.  I won't be as desirable.  BUT, it will be enough FOR ME.  Yes, I really do use my \"For Me\" filter.  So FOR ME, 240 pounds equals strong and fit.       \n\n\n\n\"Oh great BigTex, you have blathered about ***Onederland***, so what is your point here?\"  Well this morning, after I woke up, I was taking my morning tinkle and looked down at my feet (yes, somewhere along the way, I could start seeing my feet when I peed).  I looked at my feet and saw that I really NEED to trim my toenails.  I started trimming my toenails.  Then I remembered that I had not weighed myself this morning.  So, in mid trim, I hopped on the scale.  My scale speaks and displays the number.  Today, I heard some magical numbers.  Then I looked down and saw some magical numbers.      [Here You Go](https://i.imgur.com/dBGB7In.gif)\n\n\n\n23 months and 253 pounds lost.  That sounds nice.  But to me, what sounds even better is 100 pounds to go.  FOR ME, my 100 pounds to go is MY ***Onederland***.  On November 14, 2016, I was looking at a HUGE number.  On October 6th, 2018, I am looking at a ***BigTex*** ***Onederland***.  And my ***Onederland*** is WON DER FUL!!!\n\n\n\nLurkers and newbies.  Perspective is a hell of a thing.  You are sitting there feeling hopeless.  You are sitting there saying to yourself, \"Holy shit, I have to lose 100 pounds.\"  I stand before you proud and happy that I ONLY have to lose 100 pounds.  Your attitude will determine your results.  You can control the food you eat and your attitude and therefore, you can control your results.  OK, I will hop off my soap box (Yes, I can hop now also).      \n\n\n\nI am feeling JOY!  I am feeling EXCITEMENT!!  I am feeling CONFIDENCE!!!

Now I realize I was in ketosis. It was honestly the best I\u2019d ever felt. \nBesides now! I now have 2 solid months of sobriety and I\u2019ve lost 10 lbs!! I\u2019m so absorbed with keto I don\u2019t even think about drinking. This has been nothing short of amazing\nThanks to this forum for giving me my life back\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9z9s9e/keto_cured_my_alcoholism/", "created_utc": 1542852703.0, "score": 1849, "author": "gyrlgeorge", "num_comments": 319, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9z9s9e/keto_cured_my_alcoholism/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Type 1 diabetic on keto - this must be illegal somehow", "selftext": "First post on Reddit. From cell phone with over eager danish auto correct. You've been warned...\n\n30 year male diabetic here. Diagnosed at 12. Never achieved proper stable sugars and been slowly dying. Very litterally. I know you might not all have type 1 diabetes, but I kindda need to share this. It says a lot about keto for diabetics/non-diabetics alike. Know any type 1's? Please beat them with a piece of bacon until they start googling type 1 + keto.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's a LONG wall of text after only one week of quite strict keto...\n\nAccording to what I've been told by doctors and one  dietrist after another for 18 years, I should be dead or dying right now. I am in ketosis (2.5/moll - got all the tools to measure and not in ketoACIDOsis -20+- which equals death rather quick). I used to take 34 slow acting units of insulin, 10-30ish units of fast acting. I now take 19 slow and zero(!) fast acting units of insulin. Measurements are different from the States but a non-diabetic here in Denmark should be around 4 and 7.5. At 3.8 you become symptomatic of hypoglycemia (personal record 0.5). Over 8 could be insulin resistance/early type 2 and at 10 hyperglycemia symptoms start for real(I have been at 45 multible times). I'm at 5.0 consistently now. No jumps... I'm used to 18 years of lousy sleep due to extreme highs and lows in blood glucose, now I can't sleep for more than four hours. I now do heavy lifting 2+ hours a day after 18 years of no exercise. Not out of vanity or for the health benefits but because it feels like I'm on speed and the not legal kind (never done drugs besides 4/20 but this must be what those sort of stimulants feel like). Again none of the usual 15-20+ bloodsugars induced by exercise.\n\nI know I'm in it for life. The massive jump in sugar control means many more years alive and without  them being with blindness, amputation, renal faliure and the list goes on. Quality of life. I dislike most carbs because they have been forced on me and hurt my body every time since childhood. No artificial  sweetener can trick my brain into secreeting insulin. Not stress, stomac line epansion, visual stimulation or xfactors can do that. Only me. I'm in complete control for the first time in my life. I eat once a day. Purely because I'm not hungry. I'm feeling full all the time because of my fatty meals and fiber from my veggies. \n\nThe keto flu is something that hit me. For a non diabetic I'm positive it can feel like being hit by a truck. For a type 1? I don't want to deminish what you are going through but... Compare it to a professional athlete being asked to do ten push ups. He would find it comedic. I guess I am an athlete of discomfort because of type 1 so zero problems there. What regular people would have sit down and litterally sweat/semi-collapse over for 20 minutes I fail to realize because I am so used to it already.\n\nBefore farming and civilization what did we humans eat? Fruit did not grow together in huge fields but perhaps you were lucky enough to find a tree during fall. The fruits would be a lot smaller, less sweet and fewer of them on the tree. There was no consistent source of carbs and we did not need them. We still don't except for a tiny bit for the brain that we get naturally in a keto diet. In the last century we have gone from recommending 20 percent carbs to sometimes 60+. We don't need to get deep into the type 2 epidemic to start being concerned about a connection. America has demonstated this with its food lobbys pushing poison and here in europe we are catching up to them in weight and type 2.\n\nWhether diabetic or not: \nIf you are on keto, continue. If not, start. If you know a diabetic, tell them about keto. To us, it's not about weight, health benefits but purely survival. It's not about \"healthy lifestyle\" it's just about staying alive.\n\nI'm a journalist not a doctor, so while I do thorough research I'm no expert and your type 1 treatment needs are going to be different. During my start I measured glucose every half hour. \n\nI have not had a high or low reading since starting. How could I? My tiny dose of slow insulin keeps me stable and deals with/feeds my brain with the 5-10 grams of carb I get from vegetables. How could that ever become a life threatening diabetic shock again? How could my bloodsugar get incredible high without carbs? \n\nThis was just my early experiences but I feel keto should be shouted from the rooftops to all diabetics. It is not healthy vs unhealthy it is life vs death/permanent disability.\n\nThink I got it all out of my system now...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8g7sh4/type_1_diabetic_on_keto_this_must_be_illegal/", "created_utc": 1525174855.0, "score": 1811, "author": "SneakyNewton", "num_comments": 319, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/8g7sh4/type_1_diabetic_on_keto_this_must_be_illegal/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I haven\u2019t felt this comfortable in my own skin in years.", "selftext": "[before and after](https://imgur.com/gallery/NhnaIlx)\n\nA couple years ago, I reached my heaviest. It was a bit of a rough patch in my life, also dealing with depression and drinking too much. I\u2019ve always fluctuated but I reached my highest weight at 260.\n\nFebruary past year, I started following a ketogenic diet. I knew it worked, but I always struggled to stay on track, especially in the opening days. Over the course of a few months (I admittedly had quite a few slip ups and drinking nights out), I lost roughly 30lbs averaging me at 230lbs. I wanted to lose more, but I fell off the wagon. Regardless, I was able to maintain my weight and I was waaaaay more confident about myself than I was beforehand. \n\nFlash forward a year later and I realized that I wasn\u2019t done with my fitness goals.

{"title": "165 lbs down (from 375 to 210 in just under 2 years)", "selftext": "Hello again all of you lovely people! I'm finally back with a new set of before and after photos, and some insight into doing keto for 2 years.\n\n[First off, the photos, because that's what we all care about the most, right?](https://imgur.com/gallery/MpGVyyR)\n\n(Edit: [bonus face before and after](https://imgur.com/a/jNRNSm1))\n\nMy keto journey began on Feb 26, 2018. I had decided to start because I was finally tired of being miserable. I was ready to get back into the dating world, and found my opportunities limited. I was worried about dying young and leaving my small children without a father. And I was tired of always being tired. So, on Feb 25, I decided that the next morning I was starting keto. Then, the morning of Feb 26, I read that one of my heroes (Kevin Smith) had suffered a heart attack, and this really cemented my resolve to get my shit together. (Despite him going Vegan, I've very much enjoyed watching our parallel journeys on social media.)\n\nThe weight *melted* off at first. Two, three, or even four pounds per week! I found a rhythm and stuck to it. I was militant about what I could eat. After the first two weeks, after I kicked my sugar cravings, it became easy to tell my kids, \"no thank you\" when they would offer me a cookie or other sugary treat. (Slowly, I started reducing the amount of sugar they consumed as well; and while neither of them were at risk of obesity, I've taken pride in helping them build healthy habits so they don't end up where I was.)\n\nEventually I lost 100 pounds and felt *amazing*! I was suddenly attractive to the ladies, and was finding success with getting laid (though I'm still not having much luck in actual dating, but that has nothing to do with my looks). But, when I hit that huge milestone my motivation started to wane, and I was no longer as diligent about what I put in my mouth. I started having little bites of carb/sugar filled foods, and my sweet cravings started coming back. I started adding \"keto friendly\" treats into my diet, like the Quest protein cookies. I found that these, while fine for some people, were *not* fine for me; they held me back from continuing to lose because I would eat an entire box every day (which comes to 1000 calories and 16 net carbs!)  I would constantly go over my calories and carbs each day, and struggled to continue to lose. It took me months to drop another 45ish lbs, and I stayed there for a long time.\n\nI was happy with where I was, and did not feel the *need* to lose more, but I was frustrated with my stall. Eventually I started kinda seeing a new lady, and I was feeling happier than I had in awhile. This lead to renewed motivation to track everything I ate *before* eating it, and paying attention to my calories and macros before I put food into my mouth. Then, coincidentally, I ran out of my morning Atkins shakes and had no money to buy more for over a week. Suddenly, without those extra calories and burst of sweetness on my tongue in the morning, I started losing weight again. I stopped craving as many snacks, and especially stopped craving the protein cookies (haven't had a protein cookie since Jan 1!)\n\nNow, I eat around 1400 to 1800 calories per day, with about 70% of my calories from fat, and keep my net carbs around 0 to 6 per day. I'm again, like when I started keto, no longer hungry throughout the day, and my snacking has drastically reduced. I try to avoid sugar alcohols simply because they trigger sweet cravings for me, and I avoid \"carb replacement\" type meals, except on special occasions (had low carb waffles with my kids this morning).\n\nAt this point I still want to lose a few more pounds, but recognize that if I were to account for the weight my extra skin adds then I might already be at a healthy BMI. (For my height, a \"healthy\" BMI is 194 lbs or lower, and I've read extra skin can account for around 10 to 15 lbs... soooo, I'm not far off.)\n\nI will continue to eat keto for life. And I thank everyone here for their support over the last two years! I couldn't have done this without this sub. You are all so inspirational, supportive, and informative! And I hope my journey can be that for someone at the beginning of theirs.\n\nKCKO\n\n*Edit: Some additional thoughts based on what people are asking in comments...*\n\n**Skin Removal Surgery**\n\nYes, I do plan to get skin removal surgery at some point. Originally I didn't plan to, because I saw it as a badge of my journey. A reminder of where I was, and how far I've come. But the reality is that when I look down at that bulge around my waist, I still feel fat, despite the evidence to the contrary. I read an article recently that mentioned of those who have lost over 100 lbs, the ones who had the skin removal surgery were much more likely to keep the weight off.\n\nWhen I lift up and feel the extra skin, to me it seems as if there is still about 10 lbs of fat in there, so I'll keep going until that is gone. I've already requested a consultation for surgery, but it's been about a month and I haven't heard from them, so I don't think they got it... I'll have to call on Monday or something.\n\n**What I Eat**\n\nMy daily food consists of about half a pound of bacon in the morning, and then a 1/3 pound hamburger patty for lunch, and another for dinner. I snack on string cheese, pork rinds, almonds, and other such stuff. I should eat more veggies, but don't often get them in.\n\nFor those eating on a budget, I hear you. I find that buying my bacon, hamburger patties, and string cheese from Costco to be the most cost effective way of eating keto. Keto is not cheap, but this makes it easier.\n\nI also drink around 3 or 4 bottles of water per day, flavored with Mio. These are essential to my success. The flavoring makes it far easier for me to drink water, and it is pretty much the only thing I drink now. I keep unsweetened almond milk and chocolate almond milk in the fridge, but now that I don't drink the Atkins shakes (I used to add the almond milk to these for volume) I go through the almond milk far slower. It's mostly used for recipes now.\n\n**Goal Weight**\n\nMy original goal weight was 225, because that was the lowest I had been in my adult life, and I knew it was obtainable. As the weight started melting off, I updated that to get below 200. I knew that would be difficult, but that I would feel damn good if I got there. Then, when I got to hang out with my brother last year (we live on opposite sides of the country) I saw his build and knew he was 165, and realized that I would probably look like that at about 185 based on my height, so I made that my stretch goal.\n\nNow, at 210, I see my face and my shoulders, and my arms and my pelvic bone and I realize that I'm already skinny. But, as mentioned above, that loose skin around my waist obscures what I've accomplished. With the extra skin likely weighing around 10 to 15 pounds, I assume I would weigh under 200 with it removed, which tells me I'm basically at my goal weight now. It's hard to determine really how much further I would like to go while that's still hanging around.\n\n**Exercise**\n\nNo, I do not exercise! At least not intentionally. Over the summer/fall I would go for a short hike with my kids about once every 2 or 3 weeks, which was quite fun! And I've found myself more physically active throughout my day simply because I can be. I don't go jogging or workout or anything like that, but I don't mind walking anymore, and I try to choose to do that whenever possible. I am more likely to have active play with my kids, and I do stuff like take them to the trampoline park when I can afford to do so. Before winter hit I would also ride my bike on very rare occasion because it's fun, and it always feels good when I make time for that.\n\nBut now that winter is here I've made less time for physical activity, and am getting a bit stir crazy for spring!

{"title": "Don't compare yourself to people losing large amounts in short time frames [Pep-Talk]", "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI just wanted to give a little shout out to people who lose far slower than what appears to be the norm on this sub.\n\nMost of the front page posts are how someone lost 45 pounds in under two months (or something like that), and that can make you feel like you're doing something wrong.\n\nLosing 1-2 pounds a week is a very normal weight loss speed. Some weeks, you might not lose at all. Every body is different. As long as you're maintaining your macros, the trend will continue downwards, which is what you want!\n\nObviously, everyone wants the quick fix, but that's not reality for the majority of people.\n\nRemember, that the more you weigh, the more you have to lose, so heavier people tend to lose at an increased rate. Once you get smaller, your weight loss may slow down significantly. You're not doing anything wrong, it's perfectly normal. \n\nBesides, it's rare someone will post that they lost 2 pounds this week, so all you're left seeing is the extreme cases, but that doesn't mean the majority aren't just like you!\n\nSo don't look at the front page posts and think that what you've achieved isn't as good. You've already taken a huge step in taking control of your weight and what you eat. That alone is commendable.\n\nRejoice other's success but also celebrate your own, no matter how small!\n\nKCKO :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8palbz/dont_compare_yourself_to_people_losing_large/", "created_utc": 1528380524.0, "score": 1797, "author": "froggyc19", "num_comments": 245, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/8palbz/dont_compare_yourself_to_people_losing_large/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Officially lost 100 pounds!", "selftext": "Female - 33 - 5'7\" - Starting Weight: 257    Current Weight: 157\n\nI've done keto a few times over the past 7 years, losing 40ish pounds and giving up before reaching my ultimate end goal only to put all the weight, and then some, back on.\n\nIn June of 2022, after attending a few events throughout the month, I decided I was tired of being the weight I was because I just couldn't comfortably do the fun things I wanted to do. My breaking point was going to a concert and being so out of breath just walking around the stadium only to get to my seat and being massively uncomfortable because the seats were tiny and I barely fit on it. I restarted keto + IF (16:8 or 18:6) a few days after the concert.\n\nI'm not gonna pretend like I did things perfectly. I had cheat days every few weeks and sometimes I even took a week or more off. I ate my fair share of keto tortillas and breads. Many times I would just not eat much during the day so I could instead save the calories for alcohol in the evening (I don't recommend doing this at ALL, just stating it was something I did and I know I shouldn't have - I quit drinking in November '22). I never gave up though - if I had a cheat day, I would wake up the next day right back to plan. If I knew I was taking a week break, I made sure not to overindulge just for the sake of it and tried to at least stick to IF for those days.\n\nI probably could have gotten to this point sooner if I did things perfectly 100% of the time, but I didn't and that's okay :) I made it here now and it's nice to finally feel comfortable with myself for the first time in a really long time.\n\nHere is a starting picture and one I took this morning: https://imgur.com/a/2dPn4t0\n\nI never got the chance to wear the swimsuit on the left because it was too small when I bought it, and by the time the weather allowed me to wear it it was too big lol. The picture doesn't show it but I do have a fair amount of loose skin - mostly in my lower belly and my inner thighs. I also have a bit on my neck/chin area and my arms jiggle a fair amount. I try not to let it bother me too much :)\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the incredibly nice comments!! I've read every single one and am trying to answer any questions as best as I can. I hate opening myself up for judgment and typically avoid doing so, but if this helps inspire even 1 person to stick with it then it's worth pushing myself a little out of my comfort zone. I know it can feel hard or impossible sometimes to stick with it but if you give yourself some grace and keep it up, I have no doubt that any person here can reach their own goals. <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/14rgr0i/officially_lost_100_pounds/", "created_utc": 1688576786.0, "score": 1790, "author": "None", "num_comments": 170, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/14rgr0i/officially_lost_100_pounds/", "html_title": ""}

Wow. I love this sub. You guys are the best.>\n\n<Edit 3: Damn! what happened from the time I went to bed until the time I woke up!?! You folks crushed my inbox! Thanks for all the congrats, bday wishes and comments. You all have inspired me to keep going and do more to give back to the community. .>\n\n<TLDR> Started keto Jan 1 at 240 lbs | 5'9\" and 49 years old. Goal was to be fit by my 50th birthday - today) Have lost 60 pounds - 5 pounds shy of my goal weigh of 175)\n\n[Before and After Pictures](https://imgur.com/XQzMTpR)\n\nLong version below:\n\nBy the end of 2018 it was clear that my weight had gotten out of control as I hit a personal best (#sarcasm) when i topped out at about 242 pounds. For a guy who was 49 and just barely 5'9\" that was a ton too much weight to carry around. I've never been one to diet and my eating habits didn't seem terrible to me at the time.  I wasn't into pop/soda or lots of sweet foods etc. but there I was at 242 pounds. I remember hitting 200 for the first time many years ago. That was tough but I carried on, then 220, then 230 then 240+. Where was this going to end? Dead by 60 and 300 pounds?\n\nI also found myself avoiding things I once loved to do because I didn't think I could physically handle it (e.g. Skiing, hiking, hockey, swimming (requires removal of shirt .. ewwww) etc.)\n\nA friend of mine that I hadn't seen for a couple of months had lost a ton of weight and quickly. Lucky for me he didn't follow the first rule of keto and told me all about it. We had a New Years party coming up and we decided to make it a keto themed party with everyone bringing a keto dish or two. I decided that night, Dec 31st, 2018 that I would take the plunge and I started Jan 1, 2019.\n\nI was turning 50 this year and I wanted to be fit and fifty rather than fat and fifty. I just needed to change that \"A\" into an \"I\". So I set a goal to get to ONEderland by my birthday, Today Aug 7th. Well that goal got crushed by mid-March just in time for my daughters 18th birthday so I set a new goal - 175 by today. I came close - I hit a record low of 177.5 last week and am sitting at 180 as of this morning. 60 pounds gone in 7 months. I've set a new goal of 165 by November 20th (my 20th anniversary). I haven't been under 185 since my 20's - that is a damn long time.\n\nThe road to 180 has been pretty easy. It can be hard at times but as I have seen posted here many times (thanks u/DClawdude) you need to choose your hard. Being fat is hard, losing weight is hard. Choose your \"hard\".\n\nI've had many non-scale victories along the way. Last week I bought (and wore) my first 30 waist pant (down from a snug 40 inch waist). Carpal tunnel in both wrists - gone. Heartburn at least weekly - gone. Sweating like a beast from the slightest movement - gone. Snoring like a beast - gone. Wifey beating me in my sleep because of the snoring - gone. Blood test scores - perfect across the board (Dr. is onboard with keto) Borrowing clothes from my athletic, 16 year old son - fun! Confidence - way up. General all round wellness and happiness all up.\n\nIt hasn't been a perfect ride. I've been pretty strict but will lapse into lazy keto mode and that slows things down. When that happens I switch back to measuring and tracking and things start moving again. I do a combination of Intermittent Fasting, a couple of longer fasts of 2 and 4 days, OMAD weeks and other weeks of 2 or 3 meals a day. Seems to keep my body guessing. My big miss is on exercise. I haven't done much exercise so starting to lift heavy things will be phase two. I just need to summon the discipline and get at it.\n\nFinally a big shout-out to the contributors on this community.

Instead of working on improving my binges (which aren't binges anymore!), we're working on ways to better manage my anxiety so that the overeating happens less frequently (about once a week right now). I broke down in tears in her office yesterday, it just felt so liberating to officially be \"cleared\" from being a binge eater.

What I meant was having someone tell me that my eating habits no longer qualified me as someone who suffered from binge eating disorder made me feel free from the Black Cloud that is BED and has been hovering over my head for quite some time.

No, I'm not diagnosed with \"overeating while stressed\" I'm diagnosed with anxiety right now and we are hoping to resolve it without any medication. Everyone copes with anxiety different. Some people don't sleep, some have panic attacks, some physically harm themselves, I overeat and by treating my anxiety and finding ways for me to cope with it, it should help reduce the amount of overeating that I do.\n\nI also noticed a lot of people writing and saying that it's something that they're struggling with as well, I'd just like to put out there that my therapist gave me [this](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/the-dialectical-behavior-therapy-skills-workbook-matthew-mckay/1008150072/2679449628496?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_New+Marketplace+Shopping+Textbooks_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP164997&gclid=CjwKCAjw7tfVBRB0EiwAiSYGM6R-ME0VJ6Cd3vdgcVjroPeAmVXp6uA_joAfbsecLtRXqA8s5KIv3xoCi18QAvD_BwE) book and we have been working through it and talking about different coping mechanisms together to help me to regulate and better handle the overwhelming emotions I deal with when anxiety strikes that is not overeating.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/86smg6/ive_officially_been_undiagnosed_with_binge_eating/", "created_utc": 1521893264.0, "score": 1786, "author": "hellohealthyliving_", "num_comments": 102, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/86smg6/ive_officially_been_undiagnosed_with_binge_eating/", "html_title": ""}

I spent the morning doing some breakfast prep, working through my physical therapy exercises while the noms baked, and then enjoying that breakfast with a cup of coffee and a postal service record. \nFibromyalgia is a pain I deal with every day. However, each day I choose to eat without sugar, bad carbs and starches, and each day I get my body moving, that pain can be managed. \nMental health is a struggle every day. I deal with attention deficit and anxiety and this winter in particular, seasonal affective disorder (aka winter depression). Each day I cook with the music on, I make a choice to ignite my creativity and keep the (lazy mind inducing) Netflix off. When I cook balanced meals and keep my portions controlled, I continue to manage my weight and overall health. This escalates my confidence and keeps my mind clear and objective.\nI am thankful to the Keto Reddit community for being there for me in the early days/weeks/months when I didn't know what the eff I was doing, to (my husband) Peter for suggesting this lifestyle after hearing about it on Reddit - and then providing constant support and encouragement throughout these four years, and to my friends and family for being supportive by never pressuring me to stop eating this way and to make frequent accommodations during events and family meals so I could feel included.\nKeto is not a fad diet to lose weight, for me and other long term keto-ers, it is a lifestyle choice/change. It's the best choice I've ever made for myself. But I have to make these choices every day, over and over again. It is not easy. But every day, every meal, I choose keto... I am joyful.\n\n29/F/5'6\"/140lbs\nStarting weight: 185lbs\n\n\nMorning update: Just woke up to a Silver medal/award(?), Reddit gold, 40+ messages in my inbox, 600+ upvotes and priceless encouragement.

I've also seen some comments/edit suggestions on the keto resources doc, these are phenomenally helpful, I will take a look at them once I get into work.\n\nAfternoon update: Holy guacamole (with extra lime juice), all! 1500+ upvotes now, some more gold and a platinum!? I cannot express my gratitude enough for the encouragement and support of this sub. Loving reading through all of your messages and comments.

Eggs fried in butter or bacon grease practically every day of his life. Fruit was only occasionally, and usually just berries from the yard. Snacks consisted of nuts that he would shell, then lick and dip in a plate of salt or maybe some radishes and more salt.

{"title": "What losing 200lbs looks like SW 389 CW 189.6 F\\38\\5'8\"", "selftext": "I know it's not transformation tuesday  but I need to shout from the mountain tops! Today I hit 200lbs lost since I started August 2018.\nI never thought I would actually get to where I am. I set out with no goal, I was just sick of where I was in life and took it one day at time. I ate crap I shouldn't, suffered the consequences but started the next day as fresh as day 1. 1 day turned into 7 then 30 and the months just ticked away. I always knew I had 200 lbs to lose but found that overwhelming to think about so I took it in 10 lb chunks. With every 10 lbs the first few lbs are easy then your half way there and want to push to the goal, when I would reach 10lbs, I would take a pic, share with my peeps here and move on to the next 10.\nMy health, diet and general outlook on life is completely different than before.  I value the science of nutrition. I like setting fitness goals and watching progress. I now exersize because I want to and want to learn new sports I never tried before. I bought a bike and love it.\n\nI guess I reached my goal but now that I'm here I'll probably move the goal post and see what more I can accomplish. I'm still about 20lbs above a normal BMI and have excess skin to contend with but I'm so incredibly proud of what I have achieved and thank you to you all for the support over the years. I know it's hard and frustrating and sometimes the scale doesn't move despite all your effort and sometimes you lose 5lbs when you feel you shouldn't have. Don't worry about the details, just keep going. One small positive change will snow ball into a massive change over time. \nI'm not remarkable, or Atypical, the only thing I did differently was not give up. I had a trainer who told me with every 10lbs, change or add something so it never gets stagnant. So I honed my diet to strict Keto, try to avoid keto hack foods or at least reserve them for birthday and xmas only. Then when I was able to I joined a gym, hired a trainer, added classes like aquafit or tried spin class. Took up x country skiing in the winter and walked the neighbourhood when covid had taken away all other fitness opportunities. I guess looking back it is a lot of change, an almost unrecognizable amount of change but none of it happened all at the same time. Baby steps can be the most important because I learned how to make these changes sustainable. \n\nI learned to believe in myself, to try new things because you just don't know what you might end up loving. I gave yoga a good chance it's not for me, but mountain biking? Heck yes! I'm far too giggly to run, but love skiing.\n\nFind what makes you happy and do it often and without apology.  \n\nFitness has become my self care which has been a life saver to manage stress over the last 15 months. \n\nI feel like I'm only now starting to live my life and it's a beautiful, exciting, hopeful place to be that I could never have even imagined when I was pushing 400lbs.

{"title": "Keto has taught me that I have a substance abuse problem", "selftext": "Sorry for the click bait title. I often get asked how much weight I'll lose before I'll allow myself to eat sweets and breads again. One thing I'm learning is that the problem always has been and always will be sugar.\u00a0 To say that the reason I got heavy is because, on a daily basis, I consumed more calories than I burned is factually true...... but if we stop there then we're entirely missing what for me was the real problem.\u00a0 Freakin' sugar.\n\nI never realised how much the need to get sugar in my body dominated my life until I quit consuming it.\u00a0 When I walked into the break room and saw doughnuts I didn't eat 3 of them because I was hungry.\u00a0 I was almost never hungry in the morning so I ate them to fulfill some need other than hunger.\u00a0 When I said, \"There's nothing more refreshing than an ice cold Coca-Cola on a hot day\" my brain was actually saying, \"There's nothing more refreshing than a bunch of sugar at any given time.\"\u00a0 When I ate an entire brick of oreos with a tall glass of milk in the evening, it wasn't because I was simply craving something sweet.\u00a0 It was because sugar helped to replace some bad feeling(depression, anxiety, loneliness )with a good feeling.\u00a0 It was a coping mechanism.\u00a0 \n\nAnd the more sugar and simple carbs I consumed the more I wanted it the next time.\u00a0 When I ate plates of pasta and drank 5 cans of coke a day it wasn't food that I was after or thirst I was quenching .... it was sugar.\u00a0 I have an addiction to sugar. Two big bowls of ice cream in one sitting, an entire Little Ceasars pizza, an entire bag of Dorritos.... all mechanisms to get my next fix. And the exposure to this \"drug\" can be overwhelming. Next time you're in a grocery store take note of how many aisles you don't even need to go down because you already know there's nothing good for you there.\u00a0 What percentage of a grocery store is off limits to a ketoer? 75%?\n\nI'm not trying to downplay the severity of other drugs that are abused and wreak havoc on people's lives.\u00a0 Sugar compared to hard drugs and alcohol are not on the same plane when it comes to their destructive power. But the insight of knowing what effect sugar has on me is important.\u00a0 When people ask me when I'll eat sugar again I think to myself that I won't eat sugar again for the same reason an alcoholic won't say, \"I'm just going to quit for a year, after that I'll be fine to drink again.\" This is a new way of life for me. Keto is about taking back control of the power sugar has over me.\u00a0 \n\nJust wanted to share, thanks for reading. \n\nEdit: I've had a few people post that sugar is indeed as destructive as hard drugs. Maybe I should have noted that hard drugs tend to be more immediately destructive and disruptive than the long term ramifications of sugar. I didn't want my comparison to be insensitive to people who are going through or no someone dealing with a hard drug addiction.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7yxal5/keto_has_taught_me_that_i_have_a_substance_abuse/", "created_utc": 1519144903.0, "score": 1750, "author": "sodak748", "num_comments": 351, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/7yxal5/keto_has_taught_me_that_i_have_a_substance_abuse/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How wanting to be sexy changed my life. [ 26M, 6'2\" | SW: 330lb | CW: 210 | GW: 190 ]", "selftext": "First, let's just start with some progress pics because that's what I personally like to see first.\n\n [https://imgur.com/gallery/Z7oL02N](https://imgur.com/gallery/Z7oL02N) \n\nTL;DR - sexiness isn't a number on a scale, it's a state of mind. The numbers on the scale can help or hurt that state of mind, but only you can ultimately decide if you feel sexy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2017, my friends threw a \"purple\" themed cocktail party. I was planning on wearing a suit that was fitted for me in my senior year of high-school, when I weighed about 300lbs. When I realized this suit, which was massive by all standards, did not fit me anymore as I've gained even more weight since high-school, I was distraught. I didn't want to go to the party, I felt like garbage and frankly I hated myself for it. The next day I am sitting in the shower regretting the hangover and I come to the realization - I am not sexy right now, but I want to be sexy.\n\nI start my weight loss journey that day, having already been subscribed to /r/keto after a short lived attempt to lose weight in 2016. I stayed subscribed because I loved seeing success stories, telling myself one day that could be me, if I wanted. I gave myself three rules to follow daily to aide in my ultimate goal of becoming sexy.\n\n**RULES FOR BEING SEXY**\n\n**1. Dress appropriately.** \n\n>Frankly this boils down to one thing - stop wearing sweatpants, ratty gym clothes, etc. in public. I wanted to cultivate a sense of personal style. Fashion isn't about denying yourself comfortable /loungy clothing, nor is it about only wearing uncomfortable yet fashionable clothing. Being fashionable is all about knowing what to wear and when.\n\n**2. Get out of the house, everyday.**  \n\n>Literally, just leave the house. At first it was small steps - going to the grocery store on a Sunday, grabbing my favorite low-carb meal on saturday (Chik Fil A grilled nuggets with a side salad, remove tomatoes). Eventually it evolved into a daily walk around a lake, meeting with friends for drinks, and generally being more social. \n\n**3. Love your body; if you don't love it, change it.** \n\n>Initially when I came up with these rules, this rule was \"lose weight,\" however I don't believe that's necessary. The way I practice this rule is silly but true - I flex at myself every day in the mirror. I'm so proud of how far I've come and I want to remind myself of that everyday.\n\nNow, I could go into the details of my keto journey, what I did, etc. but realistically anyone that has lost this much has similar experiences to me. In summary - I did strict 30g carb limit for 10 months with 0 cheat days. \n\nI dropped A LOT of weight FAST. Scarily fast, in fact. When I was nearing 200lbs for the first time since I was 11 years old, I had an extremely scary moment of realization - I still hated how I looked and I couldn't envision a weight where I would feel differently. When I realized this, I immediately purchased my first pizza in 10 months and ate the whole thing in a night. After two weeks of what I was calling \"my keto break\", I could see and feel that I was up at least 10lbs. After some earnest and emotional discussion with my partner at the time, she helped me realized I was starting to look and feel like a skeleton. I was losing weight so quickly without any muscle to speak off and I looked gaunt. Yes - it's possible to weigh 200lbs and look gaunt.\n\nDetermined to not feel this way anymore, I started working out, but I knew something more would need to change. Around this time I visit Washington D.C. with my dad. We meet a friend of his who was a few years older than me and we immediately hit it off. He joined the marines straight out of high-school, got out after four years,  went to college and eventually commissioned as an officer in the Navy. I spend the next few days thinking about how much he's seen in his short life and I can't shake the feeling that I want nothing more than to be where he is when I'm his age. A few days after meeting him I tell my partner, and a few more days after that I've started the application process for Officer Candidate School. \n\nNow, at approximately \\~230lbs and decreasing, my goal is definitively set. I need to be under 210lbs and be capable of completing a 13:45 1.5mile rune, 41 push-ups, and 50 sit-ups. Knowing the process of applying/being selected as an officer is long and hard, I start training confident I have enough time before I go to OCS. My first day of exercise I ran 1/4mile and walked the other 3/4 along with some light body weight exercises. In 12 months, my fitness milestones were as follows:\n\n>10:15 1.5 mile rune  \n>  \n>1:47:30, 11 mile long run  \n>  \n>23:35min 5k  \n>  \n>Situps in 2 minutes: 75  \n>  \n>Push-ups in 2 minutes: 50  \n>  \n>Injuries: 2\n\nMost importantly, after 13 months of putting on muscle and following my three rules as stated above, I have never felt so confident and strong in my life. A lot changed in these 13 months, I ended my long term relationship with my partner whom, understandably, didn't want to risk her career to be a military wife. I made new friends and strengthened existing relationships in ways I could have never imagined. I threw myself back into my passion for photography in a major way, having booked numerous gigs through sheer force of will and doggedness. Most importantly - I felt sexy, and that's really what we're all here for, right?\n\nFinally for those of you curious - I eventually did go to Navy Officer Candidate School on October 13th, the birthday of the Navy. If you've seen the movie An Officer and a Gentleman - it's actually decently accurate, albeit dated. Needless to say it was pain all day everyday until graduation/commissioning. I've never been more challenged physically and mentally, so broken down, so completely removed from the outside world and I don't know if I would have been able to do it without the challenges and discipline required to lose nearly 30% of your body weight.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ffn365/how_wanting_to_be_sexy_changed_my_life_26m_62_sw/", "created_utc": 1583718147.0, "score": 1746, "author": "ilikefork1", "num_comments": 102, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/ffn365/how_wanting_to_be_sexy_changed_my_life_26m_62_sw/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "100lbs gone in 8 months!", "selftext": "29 | F | 5' 9\" SW: 290lbs CW: 190lbs GW: 170lbs\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster. You guys have been my rock through so much of this, so let me start this off with: thank you.\n\nI've always struggled with my weight ever since I was a kid, I was always \"the chubby one\", so I'm no stranger to diets. I've tried them all, and all of those weird pills over the years. But after I gained all of the weight back in 2018, and then some due to losing my job and the depression that ensued\u2014living off of food stamps ruined my body (pasta was the only thing I could afford), playing birth control roulette, and trying so many anti-depressants that made me gain weight, I thought all hope was lost. So I just kind of gave up and sunk further into it, figuring it was \"too late\" for me anyway... until I saw a friend of mine at the last gaming convention in March of 2020, PAX East. He had such amazing results with keto and gave me so much hope that as soon as I got home, I jumped right in, and the rest is history. \n\nI lost the majority of my weight without exercise, I was just very precise with keeping up on top of my macros. I recently added exercise in, and now I'm excited to go for walks and even bought a mountain bike. I can't help but look at myself and laugh, thinking about how previous me would have been like \"who the heck even ARE you\" lmao Now I only have 20lbs to go, and most of that is going to include toning up, so I need to get off my butt finally.\n\nHonestly, without this subreddit and the FAQ as my keto bible, I would have never had made it as far as I did in such little time. Even my husband is on board with this lifestyle change and is down 20lbs in just a month! Thank you for changing our lives without even knowing it. In what I lost in weight, I gained in hope and health. My IBS is gone, my PCOS is under control, my sciatica doesn't flare up anymore, and my anxiety and depression are not so loud in my mind.\n\nI don't really have a proper before picture because I avoided mirrors, let alone pictures... but here is me with a pair of my old size 24 jeans, and what I look like now:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/KAXnBVS](https://imgur.com/a/KAXnBVS)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jm28vx/100lbs_gone_in_8_months/", "created_utc": 1604237446.0, "score": 1740, "author": "vampyyri", "num_comments": 111, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/jm28vx/100lbs_gone_in_8_months/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "[NSV] Finished Two Weeks of KETO, I will never call myself lazy or weak again.", "selftext": "Sorry if I ramble or get a bit emotional.  This is mostly for my own catharsis, its long but I get to the point eventually.  \n\nThis has been a big two weeks for me.  \n\nA bit of background.  I've been morbidly obese since I was a little child- typical obese parents passing on horrible practices to their offspring.  Living with the nicknames like \"Shamu\" in highschool heaped on a big old pile of depression on top of that.  I spent my life being told I was ugly, lazy, weak willed, and should be ashamed of myself.  I was hated, reviled and loathed.  I was the one who hated myself the most, I internalised all those hurtful things and became the meanest, nastiest, hater of myself of them all.  \n\nEvery day I call myself names, put myself down, tell myself I'm lazy, ugly, a waste of space and resources, that I'm weak willed, that if my husband didn't need me I'd be better of not being here at all.\n\nI'm crying now.  Not because I'm calling myself those things, or feeling that they are true.  Because I'm not.  For the first time in my life I'm not.  I'm proud of myself.  I feel powerful.  I feel empowered.  I feel like I'm worth living.\n\nI am a stay at home wife, full time care-giver for my severely disabled husband.  I do it all.  24/7 care for hubs (I love him- it never feels like work, it just takes a lot of time and effort =] )  Laundry, Housework, Gardenwork, Petcare, Home maintenance, Shopping, Dishes, Cooking, etc...  I do it all on my own.  My husband looks at me like I have broccoli coming out of my ears when he hears me putting myself down- he tells me I'm not lazy, that I do two full time jobs all the time.  But I couldn't understand him, I couldn't hear him.  I just kept on dragging my way through day after day putting myself down, unhappy, unhealthy.  \n\nWith my weight a severe hindrance to just about everything, and my husband's disability progressing in severity, I recently realised if I didn't get myself healthy I wasn't going to be able to care for him properly for much longer.  It terrified me, to think of letting the person I love so much down.  I kept hearing about KETO on Reddit in so many places.  I've tried so many things, so many times.  I'd given up trying to get healthy.  But I just went for it- took that leap of faith- I don't know why or how.  I don't have much strength for myself, but for hubs I seem to be able to move mountains.\n\nI spent a run up week ordering KETO food supplies, and tossing/using up anything in the cupboards that isn't for hubs' special diet.  Then I jumped straight into the deep end.  I'm always so tired.  I never really have the time/energy to care for myself.  Trying to keep our little boat afloat just wipes me out every single day.  By the time I get a chance to take a break for food I'd find myself cramming down any processed, pre-packaged, sugary/carby things I could get into me quick and dirty.  It was all I had the strength to do.\n\nBut not the last two weeks.  I've dug deep- deeper than I knew I had strength in me to find.  I've been cooking myself keto meals.  I cried last night having dinner- it was just so nice to have a hot meal instead of a bowl of microwaved rice or dry cheerios.  I found out I love zucchini!  I found out how nice it is to make some effort for myself, I never felt like I deserved it before, or else I just didn't have the strength to do it.  I'm on the bottom of the TO DO list.  I just stopped cutting the list short- I may be at the bottom but darnit I AM on the list!\n\nI know it doesn't seem like much to just cook nice hot food for yourself and enjoy it.  It's a lot for me.  Especially knowing that its the first steps, the first days, in a long long journey to a much better physical and emotional place.  I baked zucchini walnut bread yesterday with almond flour.  Today I made a KETO casserole.  \n\nLast week I sliced the bottom of my foot pretty badly.  I've been limping/shuffling around using a cane and screaming/sobbing from pain as I carried on with the chores and caring for my husband.  And I still stuck to KETO.  When I wanted to just grab something easy, when I wanted to get off my foot and not be in the kitchen making that extra effort.  I did it anyway.  I am STRONG.\n\nAfter all these really hard changes to get started with KETO, after having to carry on with it through my every day exhaustion, and then the excruciating pain from this injury I am still going.  I will never call myself lazy or weak again!\n\nTo HECK with all the people who called me names, to heck with anyone who calls me lazy or weak, and especially a great big to HECK with me not thinking I am able to do anything I want.  I'm going to do this!  I'm already doing it!  If I can do it now when things are pretty rock bottom, I know I can stick with it when things get bettter.\n\nIf you actually read all the way through this, thank you, I wish I had a reward for you =]\n\n_____\nI'm absolutely speechless.  Thank you all SO much for the outpouring of kindness, support, encouragement, and all the tips and hints.  I wish I could thank every single one of you, my new KETO family, for your love and support but I'd be here for a week! =]  I love you all, we're all in this together and we're going to make it to our goals!!\n\nI promise there will be updates.  I did the unthinkable this morning when I found my inbox flooded with comments.  I took some before pics.  Maybe someday Ill have a before/after post if I have the progress to report and the courage to post it. KCKO my new wonderful friends!\n\nPS  I'm astounded, I didn't think anyone would even read my post and now its been gilded on TOP of all the love and encouragement.  Thank you internet stranger =]  Being worthy of that show of confidence and support will just motivate me even more to keep going!\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6qh7hj/nsv_finished_two_weeks_of_keto_i_will_never_call/", "created_utc": 1501419408.0, "score": 1736, "author": "AzureDaisies", "num_comments": 131, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/6qh7hj/nsv_finished_two_weeks_of_keto_i_will_never_call/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One Year Anniversary: 402>228 [Pics]", "selftext": "So, I lost a lot of weight this year.  Gaining weight is one of those things that happens slowly... then all at once.  I've been obese since as long as I can remember.  You know you're fat, but it doesn't hit you until you can't do normal things anymore.  First you can't keep up with your friends on vacation, then you can't buckle your seat belt on a plane, and then you can't even fit into a booth at a restaurant.  \n\nI lurked here on r/keto for close to a year.  I was obviously particularly interested in the other posts of people > 400lbs.  I just didn't know if I could do it.  I had lost weight before (20lbs here, 40lbs there), but nothing ever stuck for more than a couple of months.  Last September, I decided enough was enough, and I launched head-first into keto.  And it was extraordinarily difficult.  I was hungry, and I wanted to eat something sweet.  Sugar addiction was very real.  What truly kept me going was visiting this subreddit everyday and seeing other people's progress pictures.  I wanted to look like that, I wanted to be below 200lbs for the first time in my adult life.   \n\nI've stuck to keto pretty religiously, but that's not to say I haven't continued to struggle with overeating on occasion.  I just ensure that it's not with carbs/sugars, but with healthy keto food.  I could give a tons of tips/tricks, but the best one is put saftey rails in your life that facilitate smart decision making.  When you're tired, of course you're not going to make dinner, so it's better to prep all of your meals ahead of time.  Make sure you have decent snacks in the house (cheese has been my life saver!).  Once I realized that I was poor at making real-time decisions, it became easier to plan ahead for possible eventualities that might derail me. \n\nI want to truly thank everyone here in the r/keto community. You've all been a tremendous inspiration to me throughout the past year. \n\nBefore & After: https://imgur.com/a/8kWNlx0\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9gtzg3/one_year_anniversary_402228_pics/", "created_utc": 1537270180.0, "score": 1733, "author": "BothWaysIsTheOnlyWay", "num_comments": 194, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9gtzg3/one_year_anniversary_402228_pics/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "My Twin Sister and I Have Lost 145 lbs on Keto So Far.... (Pic)", "selftext": "I\u00a0 (on the left) have lurked this subreddit for years, barely ever commenting..but last night my sister sent me this picture and I finally feel decent enough to share it here. So many of your photos have inspired me over the years.\u00a0\n\n[My sister and I](https://imgur.com/a/bi53LYm?fbclid=IwAR3Rq2_4LMGX6hZ_Y5njHmXjl-513MhViGp3FwH0HSfIbapZ5fF_Y-2bRvs) have battled our weight since the age of 13. We have had success on the keto diet in the past. I couldn't even tell you the amount of weight I have lost\u00a0 over the last 15 years doing forms of the ketogenic diet....and gained back after I got off. (AT LEAST 200 lbs over the years)\u00a0 I went from 282 lbs to 199 lbs and practically gave up, I still to this day don't know know why . I made a conscious decision to give up once I saw onederland. That was 8 years ago. I ended up gaining back 62 of those pounds again. When I was planning my wedding\u00a0 I lost a bit of weight for the wedding, but not much (maybe 20 lbs). I ended up being completely uncomfortable on my wedding day. A friend paid for our photographer to travel to Riviera Maya Mexico as our wedding gift. We had a destination wedding with 50 guests. While it was a happy day, I look back at the pictures and all I remember feeling was fat and self conscious about how I looked. Years later I am now able to accept the way I looked in my wedding photos.\n\nSo when my twin sister started planning her wedding and decided that this was going to be the year where she actually lost the weight...I decided I had to get serious too. I knew that if she lost weight for her wedding, and I didn't that people would be comparing us on her wedding day while I stood up there next to her. People always compare us, it comes with the territory of being a twin. One of my first memories of this happening was when I was 12, and a parent of one of my friends asking how much more I weighed compared to my sister. When my sister said we weighed the same, the parent actually started arguing with her, telling her that it was obvious I was bigger.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0We have had 4 people we know start Keto because of us, and are they happy and getting healthier and love the keto diet. Of course there are some haters, but after almost a year of being on Keto, they don't bother me much anymore.\u00a0We typically do OMAD and lazy keto. I sleep soundly though the night now after years of sleepless nights. My eczema is gone. The crippling anxiety that I had for years is gone. We have lost a total of 145 lbs on keto so far. I now weigh less than I did when I was 13 years old. My goal weight is 150lbs. I am 5'11.\n\nI know this will sound cliche... but hear me out. If we can do this, anyone can. Carbs completely controlled my life before. I would think about what carb filled garbage I wanted to eat for dinner, and while I was eating it I would think about the next meal.\u00a0The secret to staying on keto and finally making the change is you have to be ready to do it. Ready to make the right decisions. It will take you a thousand decisions over the next year to get closer to your goal. And once you are on it for a week, a\u00a0 month, a couple months those decisions will become natural to you. When someone offers (demands, begs, guilts)\u00a0 you to eat something you shouldn't eat, you won't cave, no matter how hard they try. (I just had someone do this to me at my Christmas party on Sunday and I laughed.)\u00a0\n\nI plan to be keto for the rest of my life. I really do not want to go back. I hope I can do it.

{"title": "I cannot get enough of my progress pics!", "selftext": "Hey Ketoers!\n\nSimilar to another recent post on here, I had gotten so heavy (from complete lack of exercise, too much junk food, and way too much beer and wine) that whenever I saw a photo of myself, part of me died inside. I tried to justify it for a long time (\u201cI don\u2019t look so bad\u2026\u201d \u201cother people don\u2019t notice\u2026\u201d \u201cit\u2019s just a bad photo\u2026\u201d etc.), but the truth was, I felt very uncomfortable in my own skin and hated the way I looked and felt in clothes. I had gotten up to a size 16 (after being a size 4 about 10 years ago), and knew it was time to make a change. I am the maid of honor in my sister\u2019s wedding later this year, and I know that there will be a million photos of me taken and I don\u2019t want to look like shit in all the photos.\n\nA facebook friend had posted about losing weight, so I decided to reach out to her to ask her how. She told me Keto. I had heard of it, but never really knew much about it. So I started that day. I did lots of research and learned what I could and couldn\u2019t eat, and the weight just started falling off. I cut out ALL beer and wine (if I want to drink \u2013 never during the week anymore \u2013 I\u2019ll have vodka/soda water), and started limiting my carbs and doing cardio several times a week. Nothing crazy at first \u2013 30 minutes on my elliptical and light jogs, and the weight fell off. I also weigh and measure pretty much every piece of food that goes into my body.\n\nThe first month, I lost a little over 12 pounds. Same with month two. It has slowed down now, 104 days in, to about 6-7 pounds in the last month. Sometimes it can be discouraging since I\u2019m being so strict about my macros and not necessarily losing weight every week, but every time I get discouraged, I look at my weight tracker on my FitBit and see that the weight is coming off, slowly but surely. I\u2019m down 2 pounds since January 10th. It\u2019s not as fast as I\u2019d like, but it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s important to be persistent and keep going, because little by little, that weight comes off! And some days, I\u2019ll step on the scale and be 2 pounds lighter than earlier in the week.\n\nDespite me losing weight slower than I\u2019d like in an ideal world, SOO many people have been commenting on my weight loss and telling me how awesome I look. And you know what? I FEEL awesome.  I went from not being able to jog around the block to running 4 miles without stopping this past weekend. All of my ski pants fit again. I\u2019m able to zip up knee-high boots that were previously too tight on my calves. I\u2019ve had to buy tons of new clothes and I\u2019m down to a size 10/12 and Medium shirt (from XL). When I put my hands on my hips/waist, I can literally feel a difference and know I\u2019m thinner. It just makes me want to keep going!\n\nAnd looking at before and after progress pics certainly helps! I just look at this photo and can\u2019t help but think how much better my arms look! And waist! And everything! I feel so much damn better!\n\nKEEP DOING KETO WHEN YOU GET DISCOURGED!!

{"title": "One year - 139 Pounds Down", "selftext": "Hi y\u2019all, frequent lurker, occasional commenter, serial up-voter. I started keto one year ago today, and I know with 100% certainty I would not have made the progress I\u2019ve made if not for this sub, so hopefully by sharing this post and some progress photos I can help inspire some folks floating around here and wondering if this is the right lifestyle choice for them.\n\nFirst, the good stuff.\n\nSD: 1/15/2018; SW 387.8; CW 248.8; GW 208\n\n[Progress - Face](https://i.imgur.com/FVomzHE.jpg)\n\n[Progress - Body](https://i.imgur.com/mw4vhse.jpg)\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/vj39I9D.png)\n\nA few unsolicited words of advice:\n\n* The only thing being \u201ccheated\u201d by going over your carb limit or eating \u201ccheat\u201d meals is yourself. If you\u2019re looking to this way of eating as a means to lose weight, please do not plan \u201ccheat\u201d meals. Is it going to be the end of the world if you go over every now and then? Of course not. But every day of progress is precious. Don\u2019t waste them for temporary gratification.\n* Track religiously, especially in the beginning. You will learn so much from tracking about the food you eat, portions, etc. and it\u2019s also critical in the beginning for avoiding \u201ccarb creep.\u201d\n* Electrolyte balance is pivotal.\n* Remember - carbs are a hard limit; protein is a goal; fat is a soft limit and should be eaten only to satiety. If you are eating this way for weight/fat loss, there is little to be gained from incorporating extra dietary fat in the way of \u201cfat bombs,\u201d bullet-proof coffee, etc. Eat enough fat within your meals to keep yourself satiated, and let your body fat fuel the rest.\n\nNow for the life story.\n\nI have always struggled with my weight. As a kid, I was active and involved in sports, organized and otherwise. I didn\u2019t eat excessively, or eat what I considered at the time to be extraordinarily unhealthy. Still, to put it bluntly, I was the fat kid in class through middle school, high school, college, and law school. Year after year, I kept gaining weight. After more than 15 years of continuous weight gain, I was approaching 400 pounds.\n\nToward the end of 2017, I started looking into options for losing weight. I\u2019ve gone to the gym on and off over the years, tried various diets (low-fat/lean protein diets, WW, Atkins, South Beach, etc.) and here and there enjoyed some limited success. I would lose 15-20 pounds over the space of 3-4 months; but, inevitably, I would relax my standards and the weight always came back with a vengeance. I also explored the possibility of medical intervention, but decided it just wasn\u2019t the right path for me. I knew that if I was serious about losing the weight and keeping it off, I needed to find a dietary solution that I could stick to permanently.\n\nAfter a lot of research, I landed on the ketogenic diet. I mentioned that I have done various trendy diets before, with success, but I was never that strict and never had a great plan in place for the long-term. There was something about the rigidity of keto that really appealed to me. It had a simple set of rules that I thought I could adhere to over the long haul, and its proponents promised that if you followed the rules you would get results. Not to mention, you could eat enough bacon and eggs to make Ron Swanson proud. Cool.\n\nSo on January 15, 2018, I dove in head first. I tossed all the sugary, starchy, and processed foods that I was used to eating and decided that from then on I would consume fewer than 20g of carbohydrates a day; I would track my calories and aim for a lofty deficit; I would eat enough protein to maintain lean muscle mass, and eat dietary fat to satiety; and, most importantly, I would never cheat. My diet would consist of meat, green vegetables, eggs, nuts/seeds, and a moderate amount of dairy. On that day I weighed 387.8 pounds. Since January 15, 2018, I have lost nearly 140 pounds and cut about 16 inches from my waist. Today I weigh 248.8 pounds. I\u2019ve decided to upload pictures of my progress and a chart showing the long bumpy road to get here.\n\nPartially as a result of keto, I also quit drinking alcohol. Obviously, committing to keto meant I had to give up beer- a tall task considering I used to be a home-brewer and have loved the craft beer world since before I was of legal age. But, praise be to Jack Daniels, low and behold, whiskey has no carbs! So I started drinking whiskey-diet cokes whenever I would venture out to the bars. I quickly discovered that when you don\u2019t have a solid base of bread and pasta in your gut, liquor hits you like a ton of bricks. Two drinks and I\u2019d be quite drunk; more than that and I would be hungover for a day and a half. It wasn\u2019t worth it, so I decided to quit drinking altogether.\n\nI quit drinking alcohol on February 5, 2018, which has been nothing but a positive change for me. In a couple of weeks I will celebrate one full year of sobriety.\n\nSobriety and weight loss have brought about a host of other benefits. To name a few: brain fog gone; energy way up; no more back and foot pain; better sleep; no more snoring; no ravenous hunger; and a sort of mental clarity and sense of contentment that I have never experienced before in my life.\n\nI have a lot more work to do. But I am incredibly proud of my progress so far.\n\nIf I can say one more thing, it is TALK ABOUT KETO. Please talk about keto. Talking about keto has been so important for me. I know the first rule around here is basically keep it secret, keep it safe. Trust me, I get it. Not everyone will understand and some people will react negatively. But I really think you should talk about keto with your friends, your family, your co-workers, and really anyone who is interested. Don\u2019t preach. Don\u2019t force it on anyone. But, if someone is curious, why not share your successes with them, inform them about the benefits of this way of eating (and the compromises you have to make to obtain them), and try your best to make sure your people know that what you are doing is entirely healthy and safe, and the right choice for you. I think you will find, more often than not, that people are going to be in your corner.\n\nBesides, you always have the good people here to fall back on. I am really fortunate to have an amazing group of supportive friends, family and co-workers who have encouraged me along the way. But,without this sub I don\u2019t know where I would be. Thank you to all you wonderful people in this community. KCKO!\n\nEDIT:  Wow! I am incredibly touched and humbled by all of your wonderful responses. Thank you so much for all of the encouragement!

Additionally, for birthdays/weddings/celebrations/grandmas I eat a slice of cake and whatever else I *want* to eat, because people show love through food and I love being loved. I only ever eat something when I want it now, which is new.\n\nThis year has been extremely stressful for me: I graduated law school and took the bar exam. Through this year, I've occasionally found that my favorite shirt no longer fit me, which has resulted in mixed feelings of joy, pride, and irritation because I often have nothing else clean. Today, however, I'm super happy and super pissed. \n\nI'm going to be a lawyer. Last summer, I spent $1,200 on two nice tailored suits, plus a whole bunch more on dress shirts. I have a wedding coming up in a few weeks and I was deciding what to wear, so I tried on my suit. It doesn't fit me. At all. It looks like I'm some gangly teenager wearing my dad's suit to his first date. This isn't a tailorable fix. I really couldn't believe it when I put my suit on. I asked a friend if I was imagining it, and she said I couldn't wear it under any circumstances. I'm honestly stunned, because this has been so easy for me and I never noticed. \n\nMy starting weight was 230, and my current weight is 199. I still have fifteen to go. I know 31 lbs in five months isn't near as impressive as some of you folks, but I haven't been in onederland since high school and this has been nearly painless. It's been fourteen years since I was this size. I'm getting emotional just writing this. Freud said that the ego starts with the body, and for the first time in a decade and a half I'm feeling confident and like myself again. \n\nSo thanks. Thank all of you. I've only ever lurked here, but I've been watching you all for a long time. Without this community, I wouldn't be where I am. You assholes cost me $1,200, but it is well worth it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/97oh1l/suddenly_ive_found_that_ive_wasted_at_least_1200/", "created_utc": 1534386826.0, "score": 1723, "author": "LegitimateFortune", "num_comments": 234, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/97oh1l/suddenly_ive_found_that_ive_wasted_at_least_1200/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I've lost 130 pounds and have a new lease on life", "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/nixQ50h](https://imgur.com/a/nixQ50h)\n\nKeto has left me with loose skin all over my body. It's left me struggling to eat out with friends. It's left me walking around grocery stores trying to avoid things that may cause me to gain weight.\n\nBut it has also left me 130 pounds lighter. It has left me with better blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and better blood sugar levels. It has left me with the ability to jog, the ability to do a sit up, and the ability to lift a weight. It has left me with a better understanding of healthy and unhealthy foods, as well as better knowledge of what my body needs. Sure, eating keto has taken me away from binge eating foods that comfort me, but keeping me away from those things is slowly going to save my life.\n\nAt 26 years old I sat at over 350 pounds. Each day I would go to get snacks or fast food, hide it in my purse, and sneak it into my room to binge eat at midnight. I would stay up late, just to make sure I got my fix, and I would eat until I was just about to be sick. I spent years of my life stuffing food into my mouth, even when I wasn't hungry, because it made me feel safe. Then the next day I would go weigh myself or look in the mirror only to despise what I saw and start the comforting process all over.\n\nAt 350 pounds, I would spend my life just trying to survive. I just wanted to get through the next day unnoticed. But today my outlook is a lot different.\n\nToday, I want to be seen. Today, I look in the mirror and I see curves. I see a neck. I see something that I'm proud of. Yes, I struggle with my loose skin. It seems like after all I've been through and how hard I've worked, loose skin comes and robs that success because my body is still not ideal. I wish I had the flat tummy, toned arms, and thin legs. I wish I could rock shorts or a tank top or a crop top without being worried about how my body looks. But that will come with time. One day I may be able to save up enough for skin removal surgery, but for now, I try to remind myself that I am significantly healthier than I was last year, and that gets me through.\n\nKeto seemed like a fad diet that was going to make me hate myself all over again, but instead, it was something that saved my life. I woke up every morning wondering when I would have my first heart attack, but now I wake up wondering when I'll run my first 5K. It's such an incredible mental change when you're focused on health rather than survival.\n\nToday I'm thriving, and I'm so excited to make a post when I hit my one year mark on March 25th.Here's to hoping I'll have more amazing results to post.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/elvzxo/ive_lost_130_pounds_and_have_a_new_lease_on_life/", "created_utc": 1578505346.0, "score": 1716, "author": "BuiltLikeAPotato", "num_comments": 96, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/elvzxo/ive_lost_130_pounds_and_have_a_new_lease_on_life/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "A warning about \"keto-friendly\" junk food and snack habits", "selftext": "Hello fellow ketoers!!  I hope you are having a fantastic day.    \n\nAs the keto diet catches on in the mainstream and enjoys well-warranted increasing support from the medical community, food manufacturers are beginning to capitalize on the growing popularity of our way of eating (WOE).  I'm sure you've noticed the increased number of advertisements for \"keto-friendly\" chips, candy, and other kinds of junk food.    \n\nOn the one hand, this is a great development, because it's nice to have quick and easy ways to diversify the kinds of things we can eat on the keto diet, and to enjoy some of the tastes (or close to them) of carb-based things we used to eat before we embraced this WOE.    \n\nOn the other hand, many of us who live a keto lifestyle do so now because we did not have healthy eating habits before keto, and needed to make a change (I know that I'm part of that group!).    \n\nSo here is the warning:    \n\n**If you struggled to control your eating habits before you started keto, please be mindful of your relationship with the new \"keto-friendly\" junk foods.**    \n\nWhy?    \n\nBecause consuming more calories than you burn will still cause you to gain weight, even if the calories you consume were made with almond flour and sugar substitutes.  *If you struggle to control yourself around snack foods - like I do - filling your pantry with keto-friendly snack foods may not be a great idea if your goal is to lose weight.*    \n\nThe reasons why we lose weight on the keto diet are multiple:    \n\n**1. Water** - Carbohydrates increase water retention.  (This is why we lose weight so quickly at the start of the diet - reducing carbs = eliminating a lot of water we had stored in our bodies).    \n\n**2. Appetite** - The fatty & protein-rich foods we now eat cause us to feel satiated (full) on fewer calories than we did when we included bread, potatoes and other starchy, high-carb foods.  As a result, we eat fewer calories than we did before keto, resulting in a lower body weight.  \n\n**3. Insulin** - I'm not an expert on insulin and am not qualified to explain to you at all why insulin matters... *but insulin matters*.  In response to a number of the comments below, I've edited this post to include insulin as a concept, and encourage all of you to read [this article](https://www.dietdoctor.com/new-paradigm-insulin-resistance) by Dr. Jason Fung, author of The Obesity Code if you want to understand the impact of insulin and insulin resistance in our bodies, and why a low-carb, high fat diet and intermittent fasting (IF) are intelligent approaches to managing our health.\n\n**4. Mindfulness** Maintaining a strict (or lazy) carbohydrate limit *requires us* to think and be mindful when choosing our foods and living our lives. When offered food, we no longer simply think \"oh boy!\", our first thought is now \"should I eat this?\".  In addition, the early success of the keto diet has inspired many ketoers (including myself) to consider other aspects of our lifestyles and make healthier decisions about exercise and activities.    \n\nSo - when I see a targeted ad telling me that I can have ten new flavors of keto-friendly chips, or that I can eat candy bars with single-digit net carbs, or stuff my face with any number of delicious non-meal treats... I know that *for me*, there is a very real danger that I will find myself on the couch in front of the television with **far** too many of these snacks within grasping range.    \n\nIf this rings true to **you** - if you *know* that deep inside you is a tiny, spiteful little snack demon that is *mega-hangry* after being neglected by you and your selfish insistence upon adopting a healthy lifestyle, and is just *dying* to dive into a bottomless barrel of snacks and go buck wild, then here is my advice to you:    \n\n**1. Dance With The Girl That Brung Ya** - you have discovered a healthy way of eating, and have committed to being a healthier person. Whether you have just started, or are a multi-year veteran that hit your goals ages ago, *you know that what you've been doing has been working.* Do not let some corporate marketing exec ruin it by targeting your weakness.    \n\n**2. Track Your Calories** - MyFitnessPal is a great app for counting calories in and out, although there are plenty of others that are also great. You can also easily make a spreadsheet, or download one of countless pre-made sheets to track calories. There is a ton of great info in the [Keto For Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell) link on the sidebar.  Counting your calories will help you quickly recognize the situation if you end up eating more of these snacks than you should. If you find yourself staring at your spreadsheet trying to remember how many of the snacks you ate, then you ate too many, and these snacks are not for you.\n\n**3. Give Yourself a Snack Window** - If you *absolutely must* try every \"keto-friendly\" junk food that hits the market, do yourself a favor and give yourself a one-hour window, once a week.  From 6-7pm on Sunday (for example), you can enjoy all the low-carb candy, popcorn, chips, cakes, doughnuts, etc that you can eat. Spend the rest of the week getting excited about your next window. Try not to buy the food until the day of your window, so that you don't have to resist the temptation to jump the gun and dive in outside of your window. If you find yourself breaking your window and wondering why you thought it was a good idea, then these snacks are not for you.    \n\n **TL/DR: There are a lot of new \"keto-friendly\" snack foods on the market. If you have a history of chronic binge-eating, it is probably not a smart idea to start binge-eating these snacks, either if you are trying to lose weight. Calories matter. Be mindful.**\n\nEdits - Clarity & corrections, plus I've added a link to an article on insulin and insulin resistance - topics I'm not well-versed on personally.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/98jrg6/a_warning_about_ketofriendly_junk_food_and_snack/", "created_utc": 1534680033.0, "score": 1707, "author": "ChaoticFather", "num_comments": 376, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/98jrg6/a_warning_about_ketofriendly_junk_food_and_snack/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "6 months of habit change - 44 lbs gone, I have a normal BMI", "selftext": "[Face Gains](https://imgur.com/a/8N66WJu)\n\nI'm feeling so grateful to keto and this community. Controlling carbs has freed me from binge eating and hunger. I mentioned this the last time I posted -- but I also stopped biting my nails shortly after starting keto, and I was a lifelong nail biter (notice fun nails in the current picture!) My energy level has improved to the point where I have been exercising -- HAPPILY -- every day for the past 4 months. \n\nMy eating has evolved over this process -- I'm continuing to lose weight at a rate of .5 to 2 lbs per week. [This is what my weight loss looks like over time](https://imgur.com/a/jXOfpth) (from Carb Manager).\n\nSome things that have worked for me, in order of importance.\n\n1. Tracking my food - I've done it in an app and on paper--both work. If my weight loss ever slows for a week I can look at my tracker...and I'll notice that I haven't been tracking very carefully. When I tighten up tracking weight loss speeds up again. If you do anything, have it be this. \n2. Weighing myself every day. There's no surprises at the end of the week. I'll know right away if that restaurant meal worked for me or not. I didn't always have a good relationship with the scale, but daily weighing has reduced it's power over my emotions. \n3. No sugar, no grains. Not even in tiny amounts -- I find that if I try to negotiate to fit these foods in, I start doing tricky things in order to overeat them. \n4. Plenty of protein.\n5. No fear of non-starchy veg. They aren't what made me fat. I've gradually been upping my intake and if anything it's sped up my weight loss. I no longer restrict them as part of my carb count (this may be controversial--and it's probably an individual thing). \n6. Water - this is a new one I'm experimenting with, but it seems to help with my digestion. \n7. Limited use of keto products - If I keep them in the house, I'll eat 1 to 3 Atkins treats per day until the box is gone, no matter how sad it makes my tummy and slows my progress. So a box is a once a month thing. \n\nSo thankful for this community and the knowledge I've learned here. <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/n6viq7/6_months_of_habit_change_44_lbs_gone_i_have_a/", "created_utc": 1620383872.0, "score": 1694, "author": "cabritadorada", "num_comments": 124, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/n6viq7/6_months_of_habit_change_44_lbs_gone_i_have_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Thanks to Disney Magic, I\u2019m going Keto. What\u2019s your keto origin story?", "selftext": "Well let\u2019s start at the beginning. First we had to fly to Florida. Fat and Flying do not mix. It sucks. Everyone looking at the seat next to you and seeing the \u201chell no\u201d look on their face. Next, we arrive and my step-father in law had at least one fat joke/condescending remark a day. I offered to take out the trash and he said that it was in the garage but he\u2019ll take it out because I probably won\u2019t fit. We load up in my MIL\u2019s little 2 door car to go to Disney World and I didn\u2019t fit. I\u2019m tall but my belly limits me leaning forward to get in the car. We go to Disney and the first ride we get on I don\u2019t fit in with my wife and the 2 other people so she has to get out and wait for the next car with me. Eventually we go to the super popular Avatar Flight of Passage and wait 2 hours in line. When we get to the ride I didn\u2019t fit. My \u201ccalves were too large\u201d which is code for we haven\u2019t even tried locking the back brace fatty. Also, I know my calves are large because how much work they do carrying the rest of me around. So I have to get off the ride and it is 4 stories down and about a 1/4 mile walk down a corridor to exit. This was such a walk of shame. I pulled my hat down low so the cameras and the people outside don\u2019t see the 27 year old 6\u20192 362lb grown man with tears rolling down his face. Words can\u2019t describe the absolute feeling of shame. I felt worthless, like I was a burden and inconvenience to everyone around me. I felt lost and didn\u2019t know what to do. It was like the usual self consciousness what magnified a million times. I don\u2019t think skinny people understand the day to day self consciousness fat people go through on a daily basis. Elevators, airplanes, booths at restaurants, shopping for clothes, never being able to own a Jurassic Park tshirt because you can\u2019t find it in your size (seems random but it\u2019s relevant I promise) there is so much more turmoil to being fat beyond the physical issues. It hurts your spirit. Life is full of micro disappointments that many people never experience.  There\u2019s no support group for \u201cI really wanted it but they didn\u2019t have it in my size\u201d or  No one wants to sit next to me on planes Anonymous or People at concerts get grossed out when your arm touches theirs because you\u2019re sweating awareness 5k.  Every one of these moments culminated and magnified in this walk of shame. I was devistated. \n\nWe go ride Dinosaur next. Afterwards my wife insists I get something from the gift shop because Dinosaurs have always been fascinating to me. I see a shirt with sauropod that says vegetarian, one with a T. rex on it that says low carb, and another with a T. rex that says carnivore. It\u2019s not the Disney magic I was expecting but I took it as a sign. None of the shirts were in my size, obviously, but I found a pin set that had all of them so I got that. Now I\u2019m up because our hotel bed was too small and I was tired of fighting of fall off and the unevenness causing my wife to keep rolling into me. \n\nIdk if this is post is even allowed but I just needed to get all of this off my chest. If anyone wants to share their \u201corigin story\u201d I\u2019d love to hear it. And when you see a \u201cbefore\u201d picture at Disney World you\u2019ll know that\u2019s me. \n\nTl;dr Fat and Flying don\u2019t mix, my step-father in law is a bully, couldn\u2019t ride a ride at Disney world, received a sign from Mickey to do keto. Sleep deprived because I had to choose between my wife or myself, having a good night sleep thanks to shitty hotel beds and me being fat. \n\nEdit: I am dumbfounded. Thank you everyone. I am going to keep this post bookmarked for when I feel like quitting. BONUS: I am terrified of roller coasters but today we\u2019re going to Magic Kingdom and I\u2019m going to ride all of them. It\u2019s going to be my first step to stop all of the excuses I\u2019ve ever had. No more \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d. No more fear.

Eat the fatty protein cuts. Enjoy some cheese.

{"title": "A little over a year later... 320+lb to 181lb.", "selftext": "https://i.imgur.com/8HPNl7j.png\n\nSo a little over a year ago, I started keto. And by keto, I mean the laziest version you could imagine. Both physically and dietary. Every six months or so, I'd check back in with r/keto and write (typically a long winded) post about the process, progress and what I learned along the way. \n\nThe two best pieces of wisdom I can provide for those who are starting or thinking about starting, would be:\n\n1) Start now. Don't wait for the new year, or use some other excuse like I did for over 3 years before even attempting to change myself. I'd tell myself, \"I can't live without 2% milk\" or \"I've been big this whole time, why change now?\" Honestly, I'd tell myself the dumbest shit so I could eat 12 taco bell items for lunch.\n\n2) Don't think of this as a diet. Think of this as a way to reprogram or retrain your eating habits. If you're remotely like me, every meal is one you walk away from hurting cause you're so full and oreos are a way to avoid boredom. Take a hard look at what has caused you to end up in a place where you want to change yourself. Oral fixation? Boredom eat? Depression eat? Literally just like all the foods all the time? Work on correcting that. Work on listening to your body. It'll tell you when to eat and I don't mean you thinking to yourself, \"I got snacks out there, and they should be in my belly\" \n\nI lived off sausages, atkins frozen meals, steak, chicken, broccoli, green beans, lily's chocolate, enlightened ice cream, quest pizza/bars and every other \"lazy\" keto items out there. I didn't start walking, running or lifting during my time. I figured that wouldn't be something I'd continue indefinitely, and would be detrimental when I did stop. I continued living the same way I have for the last 30 years, minus my food choices and eating habits. \n\nOver the last few weeks, I've been slowly transitioning into eating \"normal food\" again. Mainly, on the weekends while still doing keto during the week. I have noticed when eating the things I was pre-keto, my portions are smaller and I stop myself when I'm full, versus shoveling what was left still down the hatch like it was my death row meal. \n\nSadly, My way isn't going to be yours, however you're more than welcome to try. If you're interested in lazy keto items, I'm a fountain of knowledge there, so feel free to ask. \n\nI wish you all the best with your journey and I ask those still continuing, or just beginning, to continue assisting and motivating those in the community to better themselves.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/itsw9g/a_little_over_a_year_later_320lb_to_181lb/", "created_utc": 1600252115.0, "score": 1682, "author": "fictionthatspulp", "num_comments": 156, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/itsw9g/a_little_over_a_year_later_320lb_to_181lb/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "About 18 months in and 50lbs down, I'm still seeing a difference every day.", "selftext": "Hey friends!\n\n\nBefore I get into my long winded story, here's my progress! http://imgur.com/a/V4ateZ4\n\nI've been posting and reading stuff for a while on this subreddit, and you guys are an awesome and supportive group. I started my journey at the endish of November 2017. I hated my job, my shape, and myself. I was also in the process of figuring out what I could do to help with my Crohn's Disease (see edit below). My SO had been doing keto for a couple years and lost an insane amount of weight. So one morning I woke up and just decided that today was the day. No last hurrah, no 'one more slice', no final binge. I had decided it was enough and I jumped into my keto lifestyle.\n\nThe coolest part I think is that I really haven't lost any actual weight for the past 8 months or so. But even still my body is shrinking. It's incredible and every morning I feel like a new person. There was definitely a period of time where I felt very dysphoric, but I worked on it and I was able to help myself get better. \n\nThe changes are amazing, and now that I've been in maintenance for a while, I'm (hopefully, if I can get off my ass) going to start doing weight training and also FIX MY POSTURE. I never realized how being fat and sitting around all day could destroy my posture so drastically. I've started to stretch every day and it hurts so bad. But it hurts so much less than dealing with pelvic tilt and turned in shoulders. That was probably the most unexpected part of the weightloss.\n\nAnyway, here is my \"day in the life\" and my beginners guide. I've posted them on here before, but I'll keep doing it even if it helps just one person:\n\nBeginners Guide:\n\nKeep your electrolytes up. Half the reason people think keto is so hard is because the diet has a diuretic effect. Overload on electrolytes in the first couple weeks. Powerade zero and pickles were my lifesavers.\n\nDon't try to replace foods in the beginning. Stick to simple foods that taste good. Nuts, cheese, steak, bacon, eggs, spinach and pork rinds are a better choice over making a crazy recipe. It will help you adjust until you are more comfortable with the diet\n\nLOG EVERYTHING. I had no clue how many calories were in food, or how much carbs/sugar there was in things I considered healthy. I use My fitness pal (the free version). There is a nutrition section that helps you set your macros\n\nSpeaking of macros, try to understand each part! 20g of net carbs a day is what I do, but remember, things like fiber don't count. Also, you should look at protein macros as a goal and fat as a limit. In general you should be eating around 5% carbs, 35% protein, and 60% fat.\n\nIt's not all about carbs. Figure out your calorie limit and stay close to it. The great thing about keto is because your blood sugar levels aren't all over the place, you only want to eat when you are actually hungry.\n\n-Careful with your vitamin and mineral intake. I realized I was getting Charlie horses at night and it was due to being magnesium deficient. I noticed I was feeling dizzy, which was due to being potassium deficient. Make sure you have all those important parts in your diet, or start taking supplements until you can figure out how to naturally integrate those minerals in. \n\nDon't do cheat days. I know that sounds crazy, but to me, I'm looking at it the same as when I quit cigarettes. Sugar is an addictive substance and I don't want it on my life anymore.\n\nYOU CAN DO THIS! Find support. Find local keto groups. Find blogs. Don't argue with people about keto because more often than not, it will is frustrate you (people don't understand biology and nutrition as much as we want to believe. Or they freak out because you're not eating fruits). Find recipe sites like ruled.me or the subreddits on here. Arm yourself with knowledge because at the end of the day, you should be doing this for yourself!\n\n\nA Day In The Life:\n\nMy usual day starts with 2-3 cups of coffee when I get up. Coffee has so much in it when it comes to vitamins/minerals your body needs (magnesium specifically).\n\nThen in the afternoon I sometimes eat something small and fatty to fill my stomach up (cheese, almonds, pork rinds). I buy bulk babybel cheese at BJs and snack on those. Sometimes I don't eat. It all depends on if I actually feel hungry or not. I try to listen to my body and not just eat based on my schedule.\n\nThen dinner is usually a large slabs of meat/seafood/tofu (some sort of steak, pork, chicken, shrimp, fish, extra firm tofu) and a fiber veggie like asparagus. Or I make creamed spinach as a side if it fits my macros for that day. I also will eat eggs/bacon for dinner. One of my favorite things to do is to just throw meat, cheese, spinach, eggs, and whatever kind of leftovers I find into a pan. My dad used to make it when I was younger and would lovingly refer to it as a 'garbage omelette'. MAKE SURE you add spinach to your diet. Spinach is a mega super food and a cup of spinach has so much of what you need during the day.\n\nMeat wise though, I live in an area that borders an area that would be considered rural. My SO invested in a large freezer that sits in our garage. Sometimes we do a Co-op and purchase half of a cow, get it chopped up, and live off of it for months. If we can't find a good farm, we go to bulk food suppliers like BJ's and Cosco, and spend about $400 on freezer meat. Ends up not breaking the budget as long as you are willing to put the entire cost up front, and it lasts for around 3 months if you buy right and have a strategy for rotating the meat out of the freezer. The co-op option is a little more expensive, but it's fresh and organic and delicious. The big box stores is convenient because it's usually pretty packaged and ready for the freezer.\n\nIf I ever want a snack I usually go for: Pork rinds dipped in french onion dip (make it myself by buying sour cream and french onion mix packets), super salty almonds, cheese, Halo Top, a tablespoon of peanut butter, 90% dark chocolate, parmesan chips, slim jims, beef jerkey, Mission wrap burritos, quest bars/cookies, or deli meat. There are also brands like Quest and Real Good who have figured out how to make frozen keto food, so we have a couple of those hanging around for extra lazy days. I've seen one or the other at Wegmans, Walmart, CVS, and Target.\n\nI have also been experimenting with keto specific recipies. Ruled.me is a great resource for weird keto friendly breads and tortillas. You don't actually have to sign up, just start typing in the searchbar. I even figured out how to make hot pockets, which was a triumph! It also help me goes from being an okay cook to a pretty decent cook!\n\nAlso I should add. During the day I rotate water, coffee, hot tea, Powerade zero and Coke zero vanilla to make sure I don't get flavor bored and start snacking. Coke putting out all those new diet coke flavors a few months ago is awesome. I have been obsessing over the blood orange flavor. I know people tell you to not drink diet coke, but my philosophy is that I can either choose a sugary drink, or choose the substitute, so I go for the lesser of two evils (in my mind at least!). We recently decided to switch to a soda stream and have cut back on how much we spend on soda, and how much waste we create, which is awesome! They also have a ton of diet options so it's extra easy. I totally recommend getting one if you are in to carbonated drinks.\n\nBut THE MOST important thing I have found to keep me going in this keto world is spices. Please, do yourself a favor and throw out those garbage $1 spices that all taste like cardboard and invest in some good shit. I personally love anything made by Penzeys spices. They are delicious, and worth the price for how long the spices last. If you can't afford it, check out your local middle eastern markets. You can find great spices for cheap. But for those, it usually makes sense to buy bulk. Or grow your own spices. Honestly find what works, but don't short sell yourself on flavor enhancers. Taking yourself to flavortown is half the fun of cooking.\n\nSo that's my story! Let me know if you have questions. I love helping people out \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: Just a quick edit for the snacks I listed - not all of them are zero net carbs, most of them are 5 net carbs or less. Mission wraps makes a low carb specific wrap in light blue packaging that is between 5-6 net carbs (depending on if you are getting the whole wheat ones or not). If I start binge snacking, I try to not binge on things that have more than 2-3 net carbs in them. I definitely never eat more that one Quest bar a day, or more than 2 wraps a day.\n\nEdit 2: I DON'T KNOW HOW I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS: One of the main reasons I started keto is because I have Crohn's Disease. I was diagnosed around the age of 21 and it has been a serious struggle. For those of you who don't know, Crohn's Disease is an irritable bowel disease, and is also considered an autoimmune disease. You're body attacks your digestive tract from mouth to gut. Some symptoms are mouth sores, multiple bathroom trips a day, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, fissures, fistulas, blockages, and a whole myriad of non gut related issues like joint pain, headaches, etc. A flare for Crohn's is comparable to someone repeatedly scraping an ice pick down the entirety of your intestinal tract. I found out that sugar was a big food related trigger of mine. Between keto, a really powerful medication called Remicade, and some other things I do, I have been able to put myself into remission. It has helped me on my healing journey so much. I was terrified at first because most of the food that is keto friendly is not listed as safe Crohn's foods. Both my PCP and my GI doctor were in agreement for me to try keto so I went for it. My baseline from a few years ago is comparable to a flare now. And in the past year and a half, I have maybe had 3-4 flares total. All of it together (the meds, the keto, the other shit) has saved my life and I feel like a brand new person.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bj2ctr/about_18_months_in_and_50lbs_down_im_still_seeing/", "created_utc": 1556624924.0, "score": 1685, "author": "thellamajew", "num_comments": 160, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/bj2ctr/about_18_months_in_and_50lbs_down_im_still_seeing/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I HAVE DEFEATED THE BEETUS!!", "selftext": "TL;DR - I got my mental health right, went on keto, and my A1C went from 13 to 5.1 in 3 1/2 months\n\nI shared in my first post that the reason I decided to start my keto journey was because I got some bad news from my doctor and my GF begged me to not let myself die. \n\nIn my heart, I already knew that I had Type II diabetes, but I was in denial. My feet weren't numb or swollen, I didn't have any wounds that weren't healing, and I didn't eat a lot of sweets. But I knew in my heart. \n\nSo, when the doctor told me that my A1C was THIRTEEN and that I was probably going to die of a stroke before 40...I didn't care. I was mentally checked out. I made a joke about it to my GF, which is when she gave me the bitch slap back to reality. I have clinical depression and while the meds I was on kept me from doing anything drastic, I was basically a walking zombie and didn't care whether I lived or died. I wouldn't do anything because I know it would destroy both my GF and mother, but I was ambivalent to life. \n\nThat day I made an appointment with a psychologist  and we added another med to the one I was taking and... it worked. I actually cared about life and actually wanted to get better. I had promised my GF that I would get healthy for her, but once the meds kicked in, I wanted to get healthy for ME. If I could ask for one thing that people take from my story, it's PLEASE take care of your mental health. It's already hard enough to fight to get physically healthy, and it's almost impossible to do so while also fighting against your mental health. \n\nAnyway, I had a follow up scheduled that was cancelled because of the whole rona thing, but when my doctor opened back, I made an appointment for yesterday. I was nervously optimistic, but I was trying to be realistic, so when I got the finger prick and was waiting, I told myself not to be too disappointed. (Side note: the doc was so blown away by my weight loss that he asked if I was on anything else besides keto). \n\nWhen I saw the doc's eyes beaming, I knew he had a huge smile under his mask. He said, \"Well, you can stop taking the Metformin now...your AC is 5.1!\" \n\nI was so stunned I probably had the dumbest expression on my face. I already knew my blood pressure was good, but I never expected to cure myself of diabetes so fast. He told me to kepp it up and I said I would.\n\nSo, yeah, when people talk about non-scale related goals, this was a HUGE one for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/gpdinz/i_have_defeated_the_beetus/", "created_utc": 1590271014.0, "score": 1687, "author": "free2131", "num_comments": 96, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/gpdinz/i_have_defeated_the_beetus/", "html_title": ""}

Been on my weight loss journey for exactly three months. I\u2019m down 32 lbs, from 212 to 180. \n\nFor anyone interested in my diet, I did lazy keto for the month of December, got more disciplined in January with a few slip-ups here and there, then really became militant on February 1 when I incorporated intermittent fasting along with keto and strict calorie counting. What a game changer that is. Snacking at night is my kryptonite. \n\nAs for nutrition, I try to stay between 1000-1100 calories per day (my doctor OK\u2019d this because I was, and still am, clinically obese). I try to stay under 40 net carbs per day. I eat mainly whole foods - lots of meat (including red meat), eggs, whole dairy, and vegetables. I love roasting veggies or making Bon Appetit\u2019s ratatouille. Maybe once a month I\u2019ll treat myself to McDonalds where I\u2019ll indulge in a Big Mac with half a bun. Other than that, I cook all of my meals at home. \n\nNow onto exercise. For the first two months, I walked for 90 minutes 3x per week. Now I walk for an hour about once or twice per week. I think once I get closer to my goal weight, I\u2019ll incorporate strength training to look more toned. \n\nMy ultimate goal weight is 130lbs and I want to be there by the end of August. I can\u2019t wait to see what my body will look like then. I\u2019m hoping for an hourglass figure! I think I have the structure for it but I have a lot to lose in the belly area. \n\nI had like a ten-day stretch recently where I didn\u2019t lose anything at all, despite eating normally. Very frustrating but kept at it. This week I had my whoosh - lost five lbs in seven days. Just KCKO.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ve had a really difficult time personally the last three months and seeing this actually work out for me brings me happiness because it\u2019s one of the only things going well in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/m2c3v0/f2751_thanks_to_keto_im_down_30lbs_in_3_months/", "created_utc": 1615418811.0, "score": 1677, "author": "pinkmoonskies", "num_comments": 83, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/m2c3v0/f2751_thanks_to_keto_im_down_30lbs_in_3_months/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "50lb weight loss!", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/gallery/enSnOpp\n\n2014 was a really mixed year for me. A death, a birth, a house move, stopping smoking. Anyway, the upshot of that year was a gain of about fifty pounds for me. \n\nStarting weight of 75.5kg (166.4lbs) down to 53kg (116.8lbs) at a petite height of 5 foot 2. \n\nI had a lightbulb moment when walking past a shop window in 2019. I caught sight of my reflection and started the usual thoughts, \u2018God, I wish I were slim again. I\u2019d give anything to be back to my old size.\u2019 Only this time, a snide little voice in my brain replied \u2018Yeah, you\u2019d give anything except six months of diet and exercise.\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but the lightbulb flashed into blinding, beautiful light and it really kicked me in the arse. In a good way. I started Keto the next day and got my backside out walking every day. I keep my net carbs under twenty grams and walk between three and twelve kilometres a day. I eat my low carb veggies and as I\u2019ve become closer and closer to goal weight I\u2019ve had to focus more on the calories. It hasn\u2019t been easy every single day, but it\u2019s been so much better than it had any right to be.\n\nThanks to the weight loss my plantar fasciitis has vanished, my femoral bursitis has improved dramatically and frankly, I feel so much better in my body. More energy, faster movement, better stamina.\n\nIf you\u2019re still sitting on the fence about Keto then know that you can start any day now and it will be the best decision you make this year.

I was tired of being in my bed, in a situation I couldn't control and knew Covid would be the perfect opportunity to train hard, eat better and fix myself.\nI've suffered from huge back pain for years and lost a lot of money on chiropractors when the only issue was my weight and lack of exercise. (I couldn't tie my shoes cause it was too painful to bend over, but now I can rest the palm of my hands on the floor in that position !)\n\nTime has come.\n\nI hopped into the keto bandwagon and did intermittent fasting everyday. My diet was mostly made of fish, charcuterie, cheese, almond milk isolate shakes and lots of low carb veggies.\nMy appetite decreased over time like pure magic.\nI cut down in half every portions of the amount of food i've used to eat and limited myself to three meals a day, sometimes two, but no snacking. I also took potassium and magnesium supplements just in case.\n\nTo introduce myself to consistent exercise, I promised myself to do 30 mins a day of cardiovascular training and nothing else. Eliptical was my training of choice, then later I discovered a passion for jogging. I recently ran an half marathon in 2 hours, I couldn't believe it. I still pinch myself to know if i'm dreaming or not.\n\nI did that, only that from April 2020 to January 2021.\n10 Months, went from 250lbs to 140lbs.\nNo excess, only 30 mins a day of jogging and a stable keto diet (with a cheat meal on Fridays for me.)\n\nI must say I'm proud, happy and I can't believe it.\nIf I had to do it again I would certainly retake the challenge without hesitation.\nSadly, I saw a lot of people around me gaining a lot of weight during the quarantine and I truly hope my story will spark a little light of motivation in them.\n\n**Edit :** Replies to frequently asked questions.\n\nI am not a good cook, I can't help you with food, my meals are reptitive and very boring. I managed to stay under 10g of carbs a day and I don't eat from 20h to 8h.\n\nYes I am shaved on the second pic, I had a white line hernia to \"remove\" in October and the surgeons assistant had to shave me before surgery.\n\nI am 28 years old, 5'9\" and I didn't do that much muscular workouts except a full month of pushups, situps and planking.\n\nYes I do cheat, cheats are good for your mood :)\nBut cheats on keto can make you feel unwell, that's why I didn't go hard on cheat meals. I am a simple man, I love Mc Donald's chicken nuggets.\n\n**Edit 2 :** For those who don't believe me, heres a [scale proof](https://ibb.co/gzNF6TR).

{"title": "Keto: a medical professional\u2019s perspective", "selftext": " Let me introduce myself: a physician assistant, in practice for 14 years. I have worked in cardiology, primary care, and pain management (not a pill mill, but treating legitimate chronic pain patients thank you very much).\n\nI went on keto 3 months ago for weight loss, and probably vanity. Just wanted to look good in a bikini! Which I pulled off BTW, as I sit here on the  beach;) I had a basic understanding of the physiology behind this diet, but as I watched pounds melt off my body I decided to read and delve deeper into the science behind it. Into the indisputable health benefits, and the harsh contrasts between keto and the usual American diet. And the thousands of patients I have seen over the years who have suffered the devastating effects of obesity and diabetes. In cardiology, vascular disease is known to be inextricably linked to high blood sugar. In fact the link is so strong, that diabetics are treated medically as if they already have coronary disease, before they even develop it, It\u2019s almost presumed that they will. What does that tell you? But the lie you learn in school is that FAT and cholesterol are the enemy, when SUGAR is the real culprit. It\u2019s the same lie that physicians are taught. This is why your doctor views your diet with suspicion in spite of the fact that you are no longer obese and your A1C is now normal. This diet contradicts everything they\u2019ve been taught. Physicians base their decisions on \u201cevidence based medicine,\u201d and keto isn\u2019t in their textbooks. Not yet. Doctors (and dieticians for that matter) are not likely to admit they have been misinformed, and even less likely to think that their patients may know more than they do.\n\nBut in all fairness, not all medical professionals walk around with that sentiment. We are after all scientifically minded and know that medicine is constantly evolving, just by its very nature. My supervisor, an anesthesiologist and probably the most intelligent man I know (also the most cantankerous) became very intrigued by my weight loss, and started doing his own reading. He referred me to an online lecture by Dr Harold Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist who for years has been lecturing on tne link between simple carbohydrates and devastating disease. ( You can access it on YouTube). And also the lies the government has fed us, i.e. the food pyramid, and the low fat/low cholesterol diet. The political pressure from tne sugar and grain ndustries to keep us in the dark. All you have to do is walk around my clinic and observe the suffering obese people endure to realize that\u2019s complete bullshit. My doctor even says now he has a whole different view of obese patients. His whole career he has condemned and shamed them like most doctors do. He said now he realizes that they may not be solely responsible for their conditions, \n\nI also observed retrospectively that the joint pain from my own autoimmune disorder seemed to evaporate on this diet. This was NOT expected. I became very interested in tne link between sugar and inflammation. So is my doctor, especially since we treat joint pain all day long. It\u2019s simply fascinating from a medical perspective. I feel like I just happened upon this wealth of information that gives me a much better understanding of the pathophysiology behind these chronic, systemic diseases. \n\nAnd all because I wanted to look cute in a bikini:) Crazy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/db0l9r/keto_a_medical_professionals_perspective/", "created_utc": 1569788323.0, "score": 1668, "author": "Satori471", "num_comments": 224, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/db0l9r/keto_a_medical_professionals_perspective/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One Year Anniversary - 131 lbs Down!", "selftext": "**For those that just want to see pictures:** [https://imgur.com/a/XyOKLKS](https://imgur.com/a/XyOKLKS)\n \n \nSo it's almost been a year since I decided to take control of my health that was spiraling out of control. July 2, 2017 I stumbled upon intermittent fasting and kicked off my health phase by jumping directly into OMAD (one meal a day). As I kept learning of the next week, I found out that keto paired extremely well with it and I launched a lazyish keto at the start.\n \nOver time, I got strict on keto and kept under 20g of net carbs (usually around 10-15g) and I watched as the weight came off much faster than I expected. I had a ton of energy and started to workout, still a bit inconsistent as I'll go 2-3 weeks with no workouts and then start back up again for a month or so. During the holidays (December 2017), I did go off keto to enjoy the food and it did set my back by quite a bit as I gained a lot of water weight and fat as I ate way too much food. In the end, keto and IF was 99% of the equation for me for my progress. I logged, and continue to log, all my food in MFP and track my weight to see overall trends. \n \n**TL;DR:  Keto and OMAD were the primary tools used; working out didn't change much in overall weight loss**\n \n \n**Stats:**\n\n* Male, 35 years old, 5'9\"\n* Starting Weight: 296.6 lbs\n* End Weight (one year): 165.2 lbs\n* Current Status:  Starting to find maintenance calories\n* Starting Jean Size: Men's 46\n* Current Jean Size:  Men's 32\n* Starting Shirt Size: XXXL\n* Current Shirt Size: Medium\n\n \n**Cons of weight loss**\nSo I feel I should mention there have been some downsides that I'm having to adjust to. First, all the new clothes I've had to buy. Thankfully there is a nice thrift store that I have been buying second  hand clothes from to save money. Finally, yes, I do have loose skin on my abdomen. Standing up it hides pretty well as a little front pouch, but when I bend over, well......it's not pretty. I'm hoping over time it will tighten up some, but I've come to realize I won't have that 6 pack unless I want surgery.\n\n**Overall**\nFor those that are just starting your journey, or those that are already on it, stick with it. Yes there are ups and downs throughout the entire time, but in the end, it's worth it. Seeing posts helped me and I hope my post can do the same to show that you CAN make a difference in your life and improve yourself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8ujbmh/one_year_anniversary_131_lbs_down/", "created_utc": 1530191872.0, "score": 1661, "author": "Ashenterath", "num_comments": 119, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/8ujbmh/one_year_anniversary_131_lbs_down/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sweeteners and Keto: with all the new people for 2017, I decided to make a sweetener guide!", "selftext": "Sweeteners are a complex issue. With all of the brand new resolution folks posting, I have seen sweeteners come up so much by so many of you. I have seen posts about Swerve, Atkins, and more. As such, I wanted to make a post directly about artificial sweeteners and how they can affect keto. They can be your best friend or your worst enemy, and it largely depends on your body's chemistry as well as the type of sweetener.\n\n\n\n\n***In general***\n\n________________________________________________\n\nIn general, cutting out sweets can only help you stick to any diet easier. Sweet stuff tastes good and when things taste really good, we often find ourselves having just one more bite.\n\n\nThat said, I personally wouldn\u2019t be on this lifestyle without sweeteners. Most of us simply want to be able to have a treat now and then. Being too restrictive can kill any type of health improvement by making it too daunting to achieve. As such, sweeteners are fine for most people to use. There are cautionary tales by some that they can increase cravings, but most people likely won\u2019t experience this and it\u2019s up to you to experiment to see if they are what is causing your cravings or not.\n\n\nHowever, not all sweeteners are created equal. \n\n\n\n***Sweeteners to watch out for***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n>**Maltitol:** This is almost identical to sugar in terms of carbs, its impact on your blood sugar is very bad.  It simply has the same impact on you as downing sugar would for the most part. It also causes very distressing bowel movements when eaten too much. Sadly it tastes very good and almost like sugar, meaning it\u2019s the #1 one people experiment with--and pay for later. **Almost all sugar free candies will use this one making them not a low carb option nor an option you want if you want to spend your life outside the bathroom.**\n\n\n> **Xylitol:** While better than the other -tol, this one is very dangerous to dogs/cats. It\u2019s toxic to them. It also can cause similar bowel issues if consumed in moderate to large doses.\n\n\n>**Splenda:** The granulated version of Splenda has a lot of carbs. This is because it uses high GI sweeteners with Sucralose as binding agents, making it surprisingly bad for low carb diets, even if it is often suggested as a SF option. Liquid splenda or sucralose itself is fine, but if a product says \"Splenda (TM)\" it is likely using the granulated version. **The sugar free candies that are not using Maltitol will likely use this, making them a poor keto choice.**\n\n>**Just Like Sugar (and anything with Malodextrin):** Malodextrin isn't good. It will often be used in products as a binding agent. Always read ingredients and, if it has that, be wary. Sometimes people will make Stevia mixes with it, completely off-setting the benefits Stevia has.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Sweeteners to freely enjoy***\n________________________________________________\n\n\n> \n>**Stevia:** This is a great, natural sweetener. Its taste can be off-putting, but when you bake with it, you can use extracts to cover it up. I recently made a cranberry pie where I simply added extra vanilla extract to mask its taste.\n\n\n> **Erythritol:** Another good one, this sweetener is gaining in popularity. Chocolate bars like Lily\u2019s and ChocoPerfection both use this sweetener, and they taste pretty close to the real thing!\n\n\n>**Monk Fruit:** I recently tried ChocZero which has monk fruit. It is the hardest to find since it is rarer. It is very, very good.\n\n\n> **Allulose:** The new Quest cereal bars use this one. It tastes great, like really really really good. It has not impacted my blood sugar and I trust Quest largely because their protein bars have been a staple for many ketoers, so this may change as further research comes out, but it is a new sweetener.\n\n\n> **Swerve/Truvia/Sukrin:** These are ~~two~~ three hybrids that mix sweeteners and they are GREAT for baking, coffee, and more. I highly suggest either one if you want to dabble in making your own keto baked goods, they are easy to use--and in the case of Swerve, they come in confectioner\u2019s or granular, allowing you to make frostings! Redditor /u/mymagaboo has also informed me that Sukrin comes in Sukrin Gold which is a brown sugar substitute making it extra useful for baking projects.\n\n\n> **EZSweetz/Liquid Splenda/Sucralose:** Remember how I said Splenda can kind of suck? Liquid splenda is actually great compared to its granular cousin, and you will find it often sold as generic liquid Sucralose. This isn\u2019t the best sweetener ever and is probably the worst on this list of \u201cgood ones,\u201d but it\u2019s pretty decent as a drop or two in your coffee. It is VERY potent, meaning a single drop often satisfies what a few TBSP of sugar used to. The Da Vinci and Torani syrups use this to be sugar free as well, and they are safe to use.\n\n> **Aspartame:** A lot of comments about this. Aspartame is pretty hated by a lot of health gurus as a \"bad\" sweetener, but I haven't been able to substantiate any of the hate it's gotten.  I have always had diet soda with it and I have never had any issues. A small percentage of people will have an insulin response to it, but research has proven there isn't one. I personally use it, but YMMV.\n\n\n\n\n***Onto the products***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nThe main reason I wanted to make this post is I wanted to suggest some good ones, shame some bad ones, and in general help out new ketoers find their substitute sweet.\n\n\n\n\n***Products that are generally bad***\n________________________________________________\n\n\n>**Russell Stover Sugar Free chocolates**: After nearly six months here, I have seen so many posts about these suckers. They are a sham. They use Splenda and Maltitol, they are not low carb, and they will stall you en masse. If your macros can handle it, having 1 or 2 is a fine treat (and technically better than sugar, as it\u2019s slightly less carbs), but anyone who is snacking on these for their calories will have more cravings and likely be knocked out of ketosis. I have had their sugar free mint patties, one a day, as a dessert for a few weeks to no ill effects but I made sure that I was eating virtually zero carbs the days I did indulge.\n\n>**Hershey\u2019s Sugar Free Bars/Reeses/etc**: Same deal as Russell Stovers, avoid.\n\n>**Werther\u2019s Originals/Gummy Bears/Twizzlers/Jelly Belly SF Beans**: Same deal.\n\n>**Asher's Chocolates**: Same deal.\n\n\n>**La Nouba**: La Nouba\u2019s stuff tastes so good. Sadly most of it uses maltitol. It is a huge shame because they make sugar free marshmallows that taste perfect. They do have chocolate bars with Stevia that are OK.\n\n\n>**Atkins Bars and Candies**: These are another sham. They use maltitol, they will make you feel sick, and their carb count is a bold lie because of the sweetener they use. When they say 3g carbs, it\u2019s really more like 15-20g *per* bar. If you achieve success eating them, it\u2019s likely because you stayed under calorie counts or already ate virtually zero carbs meaning you were still in keto after eating one. They aren\u2019t worth it.\n\n\n>**Beef Jerky**: I just wanted to put this one out here, a lot of people eat jerky without realizing it has been drenched in sugar. Try biltong jerky over the regular stuff as well or get a dehydrator to make your own so you can control what goes in it. Random life tip!\n    \n\n\n\n\n***Products that are good alternatives***\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\n> **ChocZero chocolate**. I love ChocZero. It came out recently and is taking the keto community by storm. But it's really, really good. Their 50% dark is their best by far and they use monk fruit (no sugar alcohols) which makes me love them.\n\n> **Lily\u2019s chocolate bars**. I\u2019m not a shill, but I love these things. They taste great, the only downside is they do use Erythritol. They have a lot of flavors as well, I found their regular milk chocolate to be the best with their coconut to also be good.\n\n> **ChocoPerfection**: These taste nearly identical to Lily\u2019s, slightly harder to get, but just as good. They make a great dark chocolate orange bar.\n\n\n> **Quest bars and Quest cereal bars**: very good protein bars. That said, the cereal bars taste completely different--and I like them a lot more! They taste like cereal granola bars and are 3g carbs a pop, a great dessert.\n\n\n> **Halo Top/Artic Zero**: Some people hate AZ's taste, myself included, but I am including it since so many like it. These two ice cream subsitutes rock. They are very low carb and made with sweeteners that have low GI. If you can afford the calories, add a few TBSP of heavy cream in with them and make it into a milkshake--you will thank me later.\n\n> **Skinny Syrups, Da Vinci Syrups & Torani**: These are sweetened with liquid Splenda and they are awesome for baking as well as coffee and tea. I highly suggest picking these up if you are missing something: I recently did an eggnog flavored tea with their eggnog SF Da Vinci syrup and it was heavenly :)\n\n> **Nutritious Living Hi Lo Cereal**: this one is a mixed bag, it\u2019s about 5-9g of carbs per serving depending on the flavor. It does use cane sugar. That said, it is a minor amount and has never knocked me out of keto as long as I have one serving (\u00bd a cup). I feel like it is a perfect cereal substitute if you are one of those lazy people who sometimes craves cereal in the morning.  Since it is almost all fiber, it is very filling compared to other higher carb low carb products (err, that came out badly, but you know what I mean?).\n\n\n> **Extremely dark chocolates**: These will be low carb naturally, even if they have a bit of sugar. Most have about 5g of carbs a serving. I personally like Lindt\u2019s 85-90% in small squares. Easy to track and a great treat to savor with tea.\n\n> **Biltong jerky:** While most jerky is very sugar heavy, some brands won't be. Additionally, biltong jerky is a style of jerky that is very low on sugar. Always check the label, but even sugar heavy brands often make their biltong jerky have only 1-2g carbs an ounce!\n\n> **Epic Bars:** Epic bars are really good albeit very expensive. They make a bacon bar that tastes amazing with no extra sweeteners or anything. Highly suggest them if you are going for a wholesome, filling snack that won't damage your diet.\n\n> **Homemade goods**: These aren\u2019t as bad to make as you think. Some Swerve, butter, and almond flour literally makes amazing shortbread cookies. In general, you can use almond flour in lieu of regular flour then use Truvia/Swerve/Stevia to cover the sugar and make the majority of the recipes you used to make. There are thousands of awesome recipes online and on r/ketoreceipes. \n\n> **Have any others?** I will add them here, let me know.\n\n\n***The science***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nThis is a helpful chart of every GI of every sweetener, including things like honey vs regular sugar. \n\n\n* http://www.sugar-and-sweetener-guide.com/glycemic-index-for-sweeteners.html \n\n\n\n***A few recipes***\n\n________________________________________________\n\nHere are a few recipes I have made while on keto and enjoyed that help with a sweet tooth. There are thousands more, these are just a few I can verify are pretty good and fairly easy to make (I sucked at baking prior!).\n\n* http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2016/11/low-carb-cranberry-cheesecake-pie.html\n* http://www.ruled.me/keto-chocolate-cake-mug/ \n* http://www.ruled.me/keto-chocolate-roll-cake/ \n* http://paleomagazine.com/paleo-peppermint-patties-recipe\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/5lrp3l/sweeteners_and_keto_with_all_the_new_people_for/", "created_utc": 1483446887.0, "score": 1661, "author": "ashelia", "num_comments": 485, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/5lrp3l/sweeteners_and_keto_with_all_the_new_people_for/", "html_title": ""}

Keto is AMAZING", "selftext": "[Photo](https://imgur.com/gallery/UmhbjaK)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/UmhbjaK\n\nI just wanted to share my joy this morning. 2 years ago my SO and I attended a wedding in her hometown.

{"title": "I'm not the same person anymore - 65 lbs gone", "selftext": "I had memories come up on facebook that reminded me of my trip to LA three years ago with my best friend. He asked me to go, and I never say no to travel when asked - you just never know what kind of adventures you'll have. I ordered so many outfits from Asos my suitcase was almost too heavy to check (foreshadowing?). I remember getting on the plane, and the arm rests cutting into my legs the whole time. I remember I felt relieved that I could close the seatbelt, even though it barely made it. I felt ashamed and pulled the tray down in front of me and drowned my sorrows in chardonnay and a cheese plate.\n\nWhen we got to LA, I unpacked my suitcase, and none of the outfits that I had bought fit me. I ended up wearing black jeans and a black tank top the entire trip. I got my weed card when I was there and did a lot of binge eating to try to escape my discomfort, which, as you know, only made me hate myself more. My bestie is an athlete who runs 13 miles everyday, and seeing him exercise on vacation made me feel like a toe thumb. To make matters worse, I was also in the closet back then, and met a random stranger to hook up with, which also made me feel like shit about myself even more.\n\nI have since lost 65 pounds, have come out as bisexual to my entire family, all my friends, and at work, changed careers, am pioneering an LGBT community at work, and have been slowly but surely coming more and more out of my shell and letting new people get closer to me. I have a lot more work to do on myself inside and out. I want to lose some more weight, and tone up, but I am nearly at my goal of size ten jeans, which I was in high school. I'm between a 10 and a 12 right now, but 10 is still a big too snug.

{"title": "Date Night", "selftext": "Husband and I have been on Keto for 10 days now and loving it. However, this WOE threw a bit of a wrench into our weekly date night. For the past two years, we\u2019ve gone to our favorite Thai restaurant once a week to get mostly fried rice or pad woon sen (neither of which are options now). In this time we\u2019ve become friends with the owner of the restaurant and they always know to expect us on Wednesday nights. \n\nLast week we had some pretty heavy snow so we weren\u2019t able to make it out to the restaurant during the very start of the diet, but I\u2019ve been really worried about going out to Thai now that we\u2019re eating Keto - I didn\u2019t want to lose this weekly tradition of spending time together and seeing the restaurant staff that have become our friends and I didn\u2019t want them to lose our business either! \n\nIn preparation, we fasted today (which was so much easier than I thought it would be!!), then this evening we went to the restaurant and talked to the owner about what Keto was and why we\u2019re doing it (weight loss/health/PCOS). He said \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of you\u201d and brought us giant plates of roasted chicken, stir fried pork belly, and green veggies. It was absolutely wonderful!!!

{"title": "I compiled a list of zero/very low carb foods that are great for keto!", "selftext": "When I first started with low carb, ketogenic diet, I was paranoid about counting carbs. It was not pretty, but I wanted to make sure that I get into ketosis as fast as possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSometimes, I just want to make my life a little easier and not get overwhelmed by inputting carbs into [myfitnesspal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't you worry, I created a comprehensive no/very low carb food list that you can use whenever you don't feel like counting carbs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo no carb foods exist in their natural form? Just take a look at food labels for cheese or meat. Most of them say that they have zero carbs in them. It is not really true, though. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nCompanies usually do this when carbs in ketogenic foods are negligible, which is less than 1 grams per serving.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is probably shocking to you. I was shocked too!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't be discouraged, I am here to walk you through the no/very low carb food list and reveal the usual pitfalls that food companies don't tell you. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n# No carb meats\n\nI try to buy my meats in the farmer's market, to make sure they are unprocessed and truly have no carbs. Processed meats have various chemical compounds that are not naturally present in fresh meat. These chemicals could be [detrimental](https://authoritynutrition.com/why-processed-meat-is-bad) to your health. I want to point out that not all processed meats are bad for you. A lot of them are just cured with spices and salt without chemicals. Just watch out for the additional carbs!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a list of processed meats:**\n\n* Hot dogs\n* Salami\n* Sausages\n* Bacon\n* Ham\n* Salted and cured meat (corned beef)\n* Smoked meat\n* Dried meat (beef jerky)\n* Canned meat\n* Ham\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a list of popular, unprocessed no carb meats:**\n\n* Beef\n* Pork\n* Veal\n* Chicken\n* Lamb\n* Turkey\n* Duck\n* Quail\n* Hen\n* Most organ meat from animals (livers could have carbs)\n* Elk\n* Caribou\n* Ostrich\n* Venison\n* Bison\n* Emu\n* Rabbit\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# No carb seafood\n\nWhen it comes to seafood, you should understand that some seafood naturally contains carbs. I personally thought that all seafood would be a no carb food category.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a list of seafood that has some net carbs:**\n\n* Clams    **(2.39g per 100g)**\n* Lobster  **(1.27g per 100g)**\n* Mussels  **(3.44g per 100g)**\n* Octopus  **(2.07g per 100g)**\n* Oysters  **(3.73g per 100g)**\n* Scallops **(2.41 per 100g)** \n* Shrimp   **(1g per 100g)**\n* Squid    **(2.92g per 100g)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a list of unprocessed no carb seafood:**\n\n* Crab\n* Tuna\n* Salmon\n* Tilapia\n* Cod\n* Catfish\n* Pollock\n* Spanish Mackerel\n* Flatfish\n* Haddock\n* Grouper\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Almost no carb vegetables and fruit\n\nThere are no vegetables and fruit that have zero carbs. I go into much more details about it in this guide to [ketogenic vegetables](http://www.ketogeniclab.com/ketogenic-vegetables/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a list of ketogenic vegetables and fruit with almost zero net carbs per cup:**\n\n* Asparagus (2.4g)\n* Avocado (2g)\n* Bok Choy  (0.8g)\n* Cabbage   (1.5g)\n* Celery    (1.4g)\n* Coconut   (5g)\n* Eggplant  (1.87g)\n* Endive    (0.1g)\n* Escarole  (0.1g)\n* Lettuce   (0.54g)\n* Mushrooms (1.6g)\n* Radish    (2.04g)\n* Raspberries (3.7g)\n* Spinach (0.39g)\n* Water spinach (0.6g)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# No carb alcohol and beverages\n\nWhen I started doing a ketogenic diet, I had to give up beer. It wasn't the best day of my life. Fortunately, you can still enjoy alcohol while being on a ketogenic diet. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a no carb food list for alcohol and beverages that I drink regularly. No flavored spirits. They might have sugar!**\n\n* Bourbon\n* Brandy\n* Cognac\n* Diet Sodas ( watch out for sweeteners )\n* Gin\n* Rum\n* Scotch\n* Seltzer water\n* Soda water\n* Sugar-free and carb-free energy drinks\n* Tequila\n* Vodka\n* Whiskey\n \n# Almost no carb Condiments and Seasoning\n\nI love cooking on a ketogenic diet. It is easy, and it makes you think of new recipes all the time. The right seasoning and condiments can make any food tastes wonderful. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Low / no carb food list seasoning (1 tsp net carbs)**\n\n* Salt (0g)\n* Black Pepper (0.9g)\n* Chili Powder (0.4g)\n* Curry Powder (0.5g)\n* Mustard (0.1g)\n* Most Hot Sauces (0.2g)\n* Dill (0.8g)\n* Basil (0g)\n* Chives (0g)\n* Cinnamon (0.7g)\n* Oregano (0.4g)\n* Rosemary (0g)\n* Thyme (0.1g)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Almost no carb dressings per (1 tbsp net carbs):**\n\n* Soy Sauce (0.5g)\n* Mayonnaise (0.1 g)\n* Caesar Dressing (0.46g)\n* Ranch Dressing (0.9g)\n* Italian Dressing (0.94g)\n* Bacon and Tomato Dressing (0.3g)\n* Peppercorn Dressing (0.47g)\n* Vinegar (0.05g)\n* Sweet and Sour Dressing (0.59g)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# No carb oils and fats\n\nOk, this is definitely a safe place from carbs. You can use any oil you want and it won't have any carbs. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI love cooking with olive oil and grass fed butter. Also, I use bacon grease for cooking as well. I save it in a bottle, after cooking bacon, and use it to bring out that applewood flavor in my other dishes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Eggs and Dairy\n\nEggs and cheese are the staples of a low-carb, ketogenic diet. Most food labels will tell you that cheese and eggs contain no carbs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, they have some carbs. Not a lot, but they do.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne large egg, for example, has 0.40g net carbs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat about cheese? Carbs in cheese can vary from 0.1g to 12g per slice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a list of low net carb cheese options per slice (30g):**\n\n* Asiago (0.91g)\n* Blue (0.66g)\n* Brie (0.13g)\n* Camembert (0.13g)\n* Cheddar (0.36g)\n* Colby (0.72g)\n* Edam (0.41g)\n* Fontina (0.43)\n* Goat (0.62g)\n* Gouda (0.63g)\n* Gruyere (0.10g)\n* Havarti (0.79g)\n* Mexican Blend (0.54g)\n* Monterey (0.19g)\n* Mozzarella (0.62g)\n* Muenster (0.31g)\n* Parmesan (0.91g)\n* Provolone (0.60g)\n* Ricotta (0.86g)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you like other dairy products, like milk, I would suggest buying heavy cream (0.3g per tbsp) or half and half (0.2g per tbsp).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Almost No carb snacks\n\nI personally can't live without snacks. It is how I cope with my cravings. The importance of finding no carb snacks was crucial. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a list of no carb snacks as well as snacks that I very low in net carbs:**\n\n* Pepperoni Slices (0.5g per 14 slices)\n* String Cheese (0.7g per stick)\n* Pork Rinds (0g)\n* Peanut Butter (2g per tbsp)\n* No Sugar Jello (2g per cup)\n* Pepperoni sticks (1g per stick)\n* Biltong (0.3g per piece)\n* Seaweed (0.02g per strip)\n* Baked zucchini chips (0.04g per piece)\n* Almonds (2.5g per 30 grams)\n* Sunflower Seeds (2.5g per 30 grams)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThere are not that many no carb foods out there. On top of it, food companies make it very difficult to identify truly zero carb foods. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven though we are trying to stick to our macros, it is important not to get paranoid about your carb intake. All of the foods listed above are very low/zero carb and keto friendly. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTry to eat healthily and keep your carbs between 20-50g to stay within your [ketogenic diet plan](http://www.ketogeniclab.com/ketogenic-diet-meal-plan). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat is your zero carb food list? Share in comments below. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want to follow my keto journey, here is my blog:   [Ketogenic Lab](http://www.ketogeniclab.com)\n\n**EDIT:** Added avocados, corrected raspberries. Added almonds, sunflower seed to the list. Added mayo, adjusted for carbs in organ meats, edited energy drinks, edited coconut per cup.\n\n**EDIT2:** added some information about processed meats.

{"title": "In Memoriam of Hopelessness", "selftext": "Three years ago.  Working up a sweat to put on my socks.  Dammit, I cannot reach my feet.  So, no socks.  Tying my shoes.  Putting them on the floor.  Wedging my feet inside my shoes.  Sweat rolling down my face simply from getting dressed.  Exhausted.  Calling my friends.  Telling them I am sick and will not make it to their Memorial Day BBQ.  Not really sick, but too embarrassed to see my old friends.  Too fat to put on socks.  Pants that don't fit right.  Shirts that I have to continually fight to keep myself covered.  Afterwards, sitting in my apartment.  \n     \nToday.  Earbuds in my ears.  Pandora's \"Classic Rock Power Workout\" on full volume.  \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses blaring.  Straining on bench press rep number 6.  Holy shit, I still have two more to do.  Fighting through the fatigue.  Not able to complete the eighth rep.  Sitting on the edge of the bench.  Head down.  Sweat rolling down my face.  Dripping off the tip of my nose onto the floor.  Exhausted.  Not sure how I will get up and walk back to my car.  And I have never felt more alive.       \n          \nThree years ago.  Alone in my apartment.  Feeling sorry for myself.  Telling myself that I can't do anything to REALLY make effective change in life.  Feeling sorry for myself.  Useless.  Hopeless.      \n     \nToday.  I put my earbuds in again.  \"Peace of Mind\" by Boston playing at full volume.  Start walking.  It's hot.  It's humid.  The smell of fresh cut grass in the air.  U.S. flags planted in front yards.  Waving to my neighbors.  My shirt drenched in sweat.  Sweat rolling down my face.  And I have NEVER felt more alive.            \n         \nI welcome the sweat because my sweat washes away my hopelessness.  I welcome the fatigue because my fatigue bears me strength.  From the sweat and fatigue I am reborn.  Awaking each and every day anew.  Empowered with the ability to make effective change to my life.         \n      \nThe Brian from three years ago has passed.  No longer walking this earth.  No longer trapped by his fat.  No longer hopeless.  Today, I lay him to rest.  Say goodbye to him.  I carry on my body too many reminders of him, and therefore, no need to lay flowers on his grave to honor him.  I honor him by turning around and walking to my new me.      \n       \nI honor him by pushing myself to complete that eighth rep on bench press.  I honor him by walking a little faster.  I honor him by making sure that I NEVER feel hopeless again.  My sweat and fatigue will always honor him as it makes me stronger.  My sweat and fatigue honoring him by allowing me to dream.         \n     \nHello lurkers.  Maybe feeling hopeless today.  I changed my life eating this way.  Sit down at our table.  Eat with us.

{"title": "Newbies--Welcome To Your New You", "selftext": "Hello Newbies and Lurkers and welcome to r/keto!!!  I am EXCITED for you!!!  Excited that you are determined to do something about your health.  Does this sound familiar:  \"I have GOT to get healthier this year!!!\"  And because of this declaration, you are now perusing r/keto.  WANTING to jump in.  WANTING to get healthier.  WANTING to be happier.  WELCOME TO r/keto!!!\n\nFirst and foremost, is eating a ketogenic diet difficult.  Well, I eat keto, and I am dumber than a box of rocks.  So, start by reading this:    [Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell)  Go ahead and read it now, I'll wait for you.\n\n...\n\n.......\n\n............\n\nAre you back?  Well, I'm going to go ahead and continue.  So, what the hell did you just read?  Well, a lot of stuff, so allow me to crystalize it for you:\n\nFirst, eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  This will ensure that you are in ketosis and ketosis is pretty much the point of a ketogenic diet.\n\nSecond, be prepared to drink more water.  You are going to be tinkling quite a bit initially, so you will need to replace that old water with new water.  So, just be prepared.\n\nThird, if you begin to feel \"flu-ish\", you will need to supplement electrolytes.  \"What the heck????\"  It's ok, it's not difficult.  In fact, read this [Electrolytes](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_adapting_to_a_low_carb_lifestyle)  The easy explanation is that eating this way will probably require you to supplement your electrolytes a bit.  Also, take a minute and do a search on here for \"ketoade\".  I won't tell you what to do, but I will advise you to be prepared.     Also, the electrolyte  section is part of a larger FAQ.  You NEED to read the FAQ a couple of times.  Doing so will save you from some unnecessary angst.  Also, ask your questions here.  Ask them in the comment section of this post.  We will make this post a question and answer super duper mega thread.  One place you can refer to so as learn more about this way of eating.\n\nFourth, determine how much you should eat each day.  Click on this link:  [Macros](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator)  Set your carbs to 20 grams by checking the \"expert\" box, set your activity level to \"sedentary\" and set your caloric deficit to 20%.  By doing these three things, you will be in ketosis and you will lose weight.\n\nFifth, are those macros that you just calculated.  You need to eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  Eat below your fat macro.  Seriously, you do NOT have to reach your fat macro.  In fact, you do NOT need to try to reach your fat macro if you don't want to.   The final macro is protein.  Protein is different.  You want to eat enough protein to REACH or EXCEED your protein macro.  Why?  Because you don't want to lose muscles.  You want to lose fat.  And very very very simply put, your muscles will help you burn fat.\n\nEat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.\n\nDrink more water.\n\nSupplement electrolytes.\n\nCalculate your macros.\n\nStay below your carb and fat macro.  Reach or exceed your protein macro.\n\nSort r/keto by \"new\" rather than \"hot\".  You will gain a great deal of knowledge by doing so.  Just trust me.\n\nBy doing the above 6 things, you will be eating a ketogenic  diet and will also begin to lose weight.  YAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\"Why did you write that goofy stuff about the NEW ME???\"  Well, because if you do the above things, several things will happen.  You will begin to lose some weight.  You will begin to feel hope.  Hope that this way of eating will ACTUALLY work for you.  Hope that you might actually make changes.  Hope that you might lose weight.  Hope that you might get healthier.   Hope that you will no longer be a slave to food.  HOPE.\n\nAfter eating this way a bit longer, that HOPE will begin to evolve.  No longer just budding, that hope will bloom into CONFIDENCE.  This will be a magical day for you.  You will feel confidant that YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  You will no longer hope, but rather, you will KNOW that you will succeed.  It is at this time that you learn to respect yourself.  Learn that you are an unstoppable force.  YOU WILL LEARN THAT YOU WILL NOT BE BEATEN!!!  It will be a magical day because on that day, you will understand that you are a NEW YOU!!!\n\nYou are sitting there.  Looking at your phone.  Looking at your computer screen.  Worried.  Scared.  Doubts swirling through your mind.  PRAYING that you can find some magical words on here.  Some words that makes it all \"click\" for you.  I don't know if you will find those words.  I don't know what words to type to help you.  I do know that if you commit to eating this way, you will not need magical words.  I know that if you commit to eating this way, you will change.  Physically you will get smaller.  Emotionally you will get stronger.  Nothing magic.  You will do the work.  Keto will be your tool.\n\nYou are scared.  I am excited.  You are worried.  I am confident.  You have doubts.  I have confidence.  You don't know me.  Fair enough, you don't know me.  But rest assured, I have already walked your path.  I know the pitfalls.  I know the traps.  I will NOT allow you to fail.  r/keto will NOT allow you to fail.  Right now, r/keto has 960,766 members.  But members is the wrong word.  960,766 friends.  Friends who KNOW you will succeed.  Friends who WANT you to succeed.\n\nNewbies and Lurkers.  Commit to eating this way.  Keto won't fail you.  I won't fail you.  r/keto won't fail you.  Your 960,766 new friends won't fail you.  You are scared.  We are excited for you.  Joyous for you.  We know you will succeed.  We know what you can do.

{"title": "An unexpected keto benefit...", "selftext": "Let me start out with 2 things...\n1. I don\u2019t have flair, sorry. I\u2019m on my phone and can\u2019t figure it out. \n2. I\u2019m not 100%, sure if this belongs but I read the community guidelines & rules and I think it\u2019s OK. \n\n(Also this is long). \n\n I went to a direct sales party with my mom last night that was held in a banquet room at a restaurant. I ordered my favorite cheesesteak, extra peppers, light onions (my carby indulgence) and no hoagie. \n\nIt caught the attention of the girl running the party who also eats low carb. She asked my favorite snacks and some other things etc. people looked at me a little (I\u2019m still ~330 lbs (hopefully less, weigh in tomorrow) but down from 370). It felt really good, almost like I was better than them? Or like they were impressed? Idk, as a super obese person I feel like nobody has ever even really looked at me in years. \n\nAnyway, we eat and I can only eat about half of it and get a box. Everyone else... literally EVERYONE, got dessert except me and my mom and the girl running the party. \n\nThe desserts were huge and beautiful and mouthwatering...except my mouth wasn\u2019t really watering. I was still just full from my steak. \n\nMy high horse got even higher though as everyone started digging in. I\u2019ve NEVER been the person to make a healthy choice in a social situation and I did it. I was literally feeling so good about it. \n\nDon\u2019t downvote me! I didn\u2019t act snotty and I normally have super low self esteem thinking everyone is better than me so this was just an awesome deviation from the normal. I\u2019m actually really nice in my head 99% of the time. \n\nI had a planned \u201ctreat\u201d for when I got home (diet root beer and homemade whipped cream) and I didn\u2019t even have it, I just went to bed. Never would have happened before.  \n\nToday, I went to lunch with my husband and did the whole thing again and got the same high. \n\nI literally love keto and my takeaway is that I\u2019m really a beautiful 132 lb butterfly waiting to come out, I\u2019m not really addicted to sugar anymore and I finally understand the draw of a \u201chealthy\u201d lifestyle and attitude. \n\nTLDR: Ate keto in a social setting, felt better than everyone else.

{"title": "My Keto Journey. 280lb-155LB.", "selftext": "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey everyone!\n\nI'm so inspired seeing all of your success stories, so I figured it was time to post my full story.\n\nThe two photos here take place in very different parts of my life. The one on the left, was taken in July of 2017. It was the 4th of July parade in my neighborhood and I remember hating how I looked in the photo. The photo on the right was taken at a wedding about a month ago. But there is so much more to the story than the simple difference in weight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was approximately 280-285 lb in February of 2018... Which was the highest I've ever weight and the beginning of the darkest chapter of my life (divorce). I honestly don't know how I got to be that heavy. I got married when I was 19 at 180 lbs and before I knew it, I had ballooned up about 100 lbs. It was truly a mixture of depression from an unhappy relationship, not caring about what I ate, and poor habits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was a wreck. It was honestly the lowest point of my life and I wouldn't wish it upon my first enemy. The emotional rollercoasters of a divorce are devastating, especially when there are little ones involved. But blessings often have a way of appearing as tragedies. I realized that although I was going through the most difficult period of my life, I was somehow happier. I was free of a relationship that should have ended years sooner. And when I think back on it today, I thank her for setting me free. I would have never left otherwise and would probably still be where I was just a couple of years ago, weight wise and depressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first 20-30 lbs quickly disappeared once she initiated the divorce. I needed a way to channel my emotions, so I decided to capitalize on this opportunity and join a gym. A couple of months later and I was down a total of 50lb. I felt amazing. I was more confident and proud of all that I had accomplished. Then my weight plateaud at about 230lb. I couldn't lose anymore no matter what I tried. I felt like crap, groggy, tired, and couldn't concentrate. My eating habits were still poor and I was reverting back to old habits. The scale started to go the other way...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA friend then introduced me to keto. I began researching like a mad man and fully committed. In October of 2018, I began my Keto kourney. I emptied my kitchen of all that was filled with carbs and sugar. I probably dumped around $300-400 worth of food that day. It was upsetting to see it go to waste, but liberating at the same time. Anything that symbolized my old eating habits went right into the trash. I then went to the store, bought a vacuum sealer and about $400 worth of food. Then came 2-3 hours of prepping myself for healthy meals. I saw great results right off the bat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 2 months in, I was comfortable enough to reintroduce keto friendly versions of the foods I loved the most. Pizza, cookies, cheesecake, and more! My love for cooking meshed very well with my love for keto and I thoroughly enjoyed ketofying all of my favorite foods. Being able to do this gave me a whole new perspective on the keto lifestyle. It opened up so many doors and what resulted was a new framework of thinking that combined a happy and healthy lifestyle with great food and positive results. I was HAPPY. I was more AWARE. I was more ACTIVE. And most importantly, I felt balanced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forwarding to today, the picture on the right was taken at a wedding about a month ago. I'm currently at 155lb. My pant size went from a 44 waist to a 28 waist. I've stopped obsessively stepping on the scale. I've stopped tracking macros to the EXACT CALORIE. At this point, keto is not a diet for me. It is a lifestyle. And a lifestyle that I am used to. I let my body does what it wants and as long as I stay true to the Keto lifestyle, I know it will treat me right. Some weeks, I gain 1-2 lbs. And then it comes right off. But I keep true to the fundamentals. I keep up the healthy habits. Keto is my life and will be for the foreseeable future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started as an obese, depressed, and hopeless individual. I thought there was no hope. I thought there would be no light at the end of the tunnel. And I am so thankful that I was able to stick it through to today. I am proud of who I am today. Proud of who I am after a divorce. And proud of what I have accomplished on Keto. I could not have done any of it without your support, guidance, and success stories. With that being said, I figured it was time to post my own. Thank you /r/Keto for everything you've given me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you all a Merry Monday. Keep Calm and Keto on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've added some more images in the comments from my 'sad days' and my happy days.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/eoaui5/my_keto_journey_280lb155lb/", "created_utc": 1578951598.0, "score": 1623, "author": "AverageJoesKeto", "num_comments": 210, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/eoaui5/my_keto_journey_280lb155lb/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Keto \"my way\" - a simple, easy-to-follow TL;DR guide from a 4-year vet", "selftext": "Hi ketopians! I've been doing this for nearly 4 years now, which realization prompted me to write down the method I've settled on after extensive trial and error.\n\nI am not a doctor, or a nutritionist, or any kind of professional. I'm just a person who's been eating low-carb with varying levels of commitment for a long time. I've settled on a simple, satisfying, effective method, which I will share here. YMMV, but I believe it'll work for most people.\n\n**The Theory, in a Nutshell**\n\n- You're fat because of what you eat, not how much.\n\n**The Plan, in a Nutshell**\n\n- Stop eating junk, lose weight.\n\nSimple.\n\n**What do I eat?**\n\nAs much as you like of:\n> Fresh (including frozen, but not preserved) meat, dried/salt cured meat, eggs, butter, cheese, green vegetables, seeds, cruciferous vegetables, any other natural foods with zero carbs\n\nModerate amounts (meaning you need to track the carb counts) of:\n> Processed (additives and preservatives) meat, nuts, low-carb root vegetables, peppers, low-carb legumes, low-carb dairy (if you feel bloated, try eliminating dairy except for hard cheeses)\n\nAbsolutely zero of:\n> Grain, sugar, corn syrup, starchy legumes, starchy root vegetables\n\n**What about low-carb bread, bars, shakes, tortillas, pasta, etc?**\n\nYMMV, but I've consistently found that these products cause me to stop losing weight when I'm trying to reduce. Probably more appropriate for maintenance than initial weight loss. Don't eat.\n\n**How many carbs per day should I be eating?**\n\nMy results tend to be best when I stay under 30g/day, which matches what many proponents of the diet have suggested, so that's what I suggest. If you follow the rules above, however, you will often find that you naturally eat fewer than 30/day. I haven't needed to count carbs in years; I just don't eat many or any foods that contain carbs.\n\n**So I can just eat bacon all the time?**\n\nNo. Eat vegetables. If you don't like them, learn to prepare them. Butter and salt are your friends. *Edited to remove \"In large quantities\" due to needless controversy.*\n\n**What about cheating?**\n\nDon't. If you get to the point where you've been doing it for a while and understand how your body reacts, feel free. If you're reading a beginner's guide, just don't. It sets you back physically, emotionally, and chemically.\n\nNot one piece of candy. Not one bite of chocolate. Not a taste of someone's cake. No cheating. It is far, far easier to have none than one because of the nature of habit. Like an alcoholic who intends to have one drink and ends up in a gutter, you'll intend to have one piece and end up eating 20. That's the nature of human habits, not a special weakness that only you have.\n\n**What if I feel hungry?**\n\nEat fatty food and drink water. You're used to dieting by not eating; get over that. You are now dieting by eating. If you feel like you're eating and eating and still hungry, you're not hungry - you're craving junk food.\n\n**What do I do if I cheat?**\n\nIt happens. Oops, I ate a donut. You'll probably be tempted to say, \"Well, I'll start again tomorrow.\" Fuck that. Start again now. The donut was a mistake, don't compound it by making deals with yourself. Respond to cheats by going back to the correct diet immediately.\n\n**Should I weigh myself?**\n\nYes, and here's how: Wake up, pee, step on the scale. Do this at the same time every day. Put the numbers into a spreadsheet and make them into a running chart. You're going to see a line that oscillates seemingly at random for a while. After some time, you'll see a general downward trend. Don't panic about upward swings; your body changes weight within a range every day. We're trying to move the range down.\n\n**What can I expect at different times in the diet?**\n\n- Week 1: Hungry all the time. Dehydrated. Energy levels unpredictable. Possible large amounts of weight loss; this is \"water weight\" or inflammation. Eat when hungry, eat tons of fat, drink lots of water.\n\n- Week 2: Still hungry a lot, carb cravings start to be severe (if they haven't already). You will fantasize about carbs. Dream about them. Don't eat them.\n\n- Week 3: Hunger gets under control. You start to go longer and longer without feeling hungry. Carb cravings hopefully begin to fade.\n\n- Week 4: Hunger should be under control by now. You may not feel hungry for meals you're used to eating. Don't worry about it; if you're not hungry, you don't need to eat. Carb cravings should have subsided to manageable levels by now.\n\n**I don't have time to cook/I eat out a lot/my parents make my food.**\n\nI see this sort of whining all the time. It's nonsense that somehow tries to use laziness as an excuse for failure. If you have time to sit in the drive-through, you have time to nuke pre-cooked chicken and a freezer bag of broccoli with butter. Nearly every restaurant has low-carb food options, even if it involves ordering a sandwich and pitching the bread. Jimmy John's delivers lettuce wraps. Subway, Chipotle, Qdoba, and even most bars have no-compromise delicious low-carb options.\n\nYour parents can cook you healthy food, or you can offer to cook for them. Most parents and family members will be delighted that you're eating healthier, but pitch it as a natural diet rather than keto to avoid the prejudice.\n\n**What if I plateau?**\n\nFirst, a definition of plateau: No new record low weights in at least a month. I see a lot of people on this sub who panic when they don't lose weight for a few days. Relax. This is a long, noisy process with variation from a number of sources.\n\nIf you genuinely plateau, have a hard look at your diet. First, be honest with yourself about adherence. Did you maybe sneak in more cheat food than you thought? Do a food log for a few days if necessary, logging every morsel. If you're okay there, it's time to start counting calories. I don't expect you'll get to this point, but if you do, count calories with a food log for a few days and see how much you're really consuming.\n\nThe overarching goal of this diet is to fix your chemical and emotional relationship with food, thereby allowing weight loss without starving yourself. For most, that just means eliminating foods that are habit-forming and that prevent you from getting proper hunger signals. If that's not enough, you may have a deeper problem in your relationship with food that requires time with a therapist.\n\n**Edit**: Thanks to everyone who provided feedback, both positive and negative.

I've come a long ways in the last couple months not just in weight loss but mentally as well.  In terms of the weight loss I've done fairly well through my commitment to keto, a couple fasts and increased exercise in the gym.  I've started to notice muscle slowly coming through in certain parts of my arms and shoulders which feels really nice.  \n\nIn terms of progress on my mental health I've made some simple, yet big feats which will hopefully help me grow over the next year.  I've really come to accept that I deserve to feel happy about myself, shouldn't feel like a monster inside and while I still need time to make those feelings fade I'm heading in the right direction.  So while my self worth will probably always be something I struggle with its definitely improving. \n\n\nIn terms of overall health though I'm doing really good!  I went to see my Doc after about 6 months and **I'm no longer pre-diabetic**, my testosterone levels are up (though still way low) and my cholesterol is amazing despite eating bacon almost everyday (proof dietary cholesterol isn't what causes heart disease).\n\n\n**My goals for next year though:** \n\n - Get to 230 pounds\n\n - Go to school or improve career options\n\n - Find the courage to get into a relationship  \n\n - Learn to play the piano\n\n - Help others with their weight loss journey\n\n\nThank you all for being so supportive with my last post, it really meant so much to me!

[pics]", "selftext": "It's my one year keto anniversary!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/pJCz85J\n\n\n\nToday I'm at a place where I thought I'd never be. A year ago I had just accepted the fact that I was just going to be fat forever. I had been diagnosed with ADHD and Binge Eating Disorder a year prior and wasn't liking the idea of being medicated for it. I joined a burlesque troupe to learn body acceptance (wonderful experience!), and fell in love with someone who didn't care how my body looked.\u00a0\n\n\nThen, I realized that I wasn't going to live long. I knew I wanted a family, but what's the point in that if I wouldn't be able to enjoy things with my kids due to my weight? What would be the point if they had to take care of me due to health problems from being overweight? I also knew I didn't want my partner to have that burden either. I think my main turning point was in Las Vegas when the ride operator at the Stratosphere told me that I had to get off the ride because the seat belt would not buckle due to my large thighs, and getting on those rides were always my dream.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter that incident I decided I had to do something, I began scrolling through r/loseit and decided I'd do the classic CICO method, but that didn't really help with my binge eating problem being that carbs was the main thing I binged on and I was still eating them. I always saw this subreddit out of the corner of my eye and always said it was way too hard and wasn't even going to try (plus I was vegetarian at the time). Then I watched That Sugar Film and realized that I'd never get over binge eating on carbs if I didn't stop eating them and get rid of that craving, and I did. And I actually decided to click on this subreddit and absorb all of the wonderful support from you guys. I also got medicated for my ADHD which has also helped my binge eating a lot!\u00a0\n\n\nAs of now I've lost 75lbs, my binge eating is almost a rare thing and when I do its usually with ketogenic junk food. Hopefully one day I'll have the time to get back to Vegas and ride the rides on the Stratosphere too!\u00a0\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9cdo5n/i_cant_believe_ive_actually_stuck_with_this_for_a/", "created_utc": 1535908127.0, "score": 1593, "author": "MelanieSinclair1021", "num_comments": 93, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9cdo5n/i_cant_believe_ive_actually_stuck_with_this_for_a/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "[Pics] 378 pounds down to 232 pounds (146 pounds lost)", "selftext": "Straight to **[PICS](http://i.imgur.com/JXBVrsa.jpg)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've been on my weightloss journey for just over 2 years now.  I started at my all time high of 378 pounds in August 2014 and now currently down to 232 pounds....making it a total of 146 pounds lost so far (with still quite abit to lose).  The first few months I was just reducing portions then hit a stall, then discovered keto early last year, and have been strict keto for 1yr and 7 months now and planning to stay keto for life.     \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy number 1 reason for staying keto is because it basically cured my binge eating disorder that I had since childhood, for as long as I can remember I ate junk food to the point of bursting (then blacking out due to carb crash) and no \"diet\" on earth ever cured me of it, I always just kept wanting more to basically the point of near death (Getting up to 378 pounds is no way to live) and I was terrified I was going to one day end up on my 600lb life.     \n\nI stumbled upon keto online and it sounded absolutely crazy to me, but I had tried everything and failed and before completely giving up hope decided to give it one last shot....and I've NEVER looked back.  I always tell people that keto saved my life and I really do mean it...and have deep deep gratitude for the r/keto and r/xxketo community (and other keto related online groups), because they kept me going from day 1, reading success story after success story (especially of those starting out at higher weights of 300+ pounds) really helped keep me inspired and let me know that if I stick with it that maybe it would be me one day posting my own success story.  I still have a long way to go but for the first time in my life know that I can make it to goal.     \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFoodwise, in case anyone asks, I usually keep it simple. I prep my protein (usually diced chicken or ground beef) and store in portions in the freezer and pop in the microwave and with whatever veg is on hand (usually broccoli or cauliflower or green beans or kale etc).  For quick meals I make eggs.  I cook everything in mostly coconut oil or clarified butter because I like the taste.  I freakin love cheese and add it to everything or as a snack.  I also love avocadoes.  I add butter to my protein and veges.  I use stevia to help sweeten my herbal teas and use it to sweeten my keto mug cakes that I have almost daily for breakfast (just *my* personal preference).  I also love greek yoghurt as well.  These are just the things that have worked for me and helped sustain my keto journey for so long and of course have gone tweaking things along the way learning what worked best for *me* as it will be different for everyone.    I weigh everything I eat and track my calories and carbs using myfitnesspal (again just what has worked for *me*).  \n\nExercisewise: I workout at the gym on average 4 times a week, a mix of strength training and cardio, but I honestly attribute 99% of my weightloss to what I eat rather than my workouts.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAfew benefits so far:-  \n- Binge eating disorder is long gone (i firmly believe if *i* ever go back to carbs I'll be back on the binge train so never going back!).  \n- My high blood pressure is gone\n- sleep apnea  gone  \n- I have lost a ridiculous amount of inches round my waist (ummm and i have a freakin waist now and can wear belts for the first time in my life!).  \n- I breathe easier now and have so much more energy  \n- I don't get carb crashes so no more naps during the afternoon  \n- I can cross my legs, easily do pedicures, kneel, get up from chairs without needing to hold onto something and the list goes on.  \n- I have lost a whole shoe size, my fingers and wrists got smaller (who'd have thought lol) as my rings and bracelets are now falling off my fingers and hands lol.  \n- I actually enjoy shopping now and after rehauling my entire wardrobe for the first time I have a coulourful and trendy choice of outfits to pick from daily and it feels really good to finally have said goodbye to my all black baggy clothes that I wore for decades!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDrawbacks?\nNone that I can think of, unfortunately I do have loose skin but starting at my kind of weight (and height short only 5'0), it was inevitable and would have happened no matter what \"diet\" i'd have chosen.  The loose skin sucks yes, but what I have is my life and health back and wouldn't trade that in for anything.\n\nI debated if I should make this such a long post but figured it may help motivate someone out there who is in doubt of this way of eating, I was hesitant at the start too, but gave it my all and now so so grateful for where I have gotten to, keto works!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTL:DR; Keto saved my life!\n\n**[PICS](http://i.imgur.com/JXBVrsa.jpg)**\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/5hxac1/pics_378_pounds_down_to_232_pounds_146_pounds_lost/", "created_utc": 1481557784.0, "score": 1589, "author": "cherrygarcia80", "num_comments": 154, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/5hxac1/pics_378_pounds_down_to_232_pounds_146_pounds_lost/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Hell yeah, officially 100 pounds lost on keto.", "selftext": "So... my top known weight is 360. Found this out in fall of 2014, and I went to a regular CICO diet and did lose about 40 over a course of 6-8 months. Then things got stressful and I had to move because life happens, and I turned back to food as my happiness. Over the next 6 months, I got back up to 347.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I cut it. I told myself there will be a hard week of hunger, cravings, pain... and I went KETO after hearing about it for a while, and weight immediately started to drop. Over the next 8 months I lost like 70 pounds. Things really started to slow down. I didn't really mind, because I felt better and looked better than I had in at least 6 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings started to level out at about 270, which has been my \"bottom weight\" lowest since I was like 16. I went probably 10 years around that weight, so I guess possibly my body saw it as a return to normal. But I didn't return to my old happens. I stuck with it. I might not be loosing weight, but I maintaining, that is just as important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead that again. Being able to maintain is just as important as losing the weight, because if you can't.... then it is all worthless. So STICK TO IT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, I focused on maintaining for about a year. I thought it would be good to have a non-deficit amount of calories for a while, to help bring my body back up to speed, let skin tighten up, etc. Though, I still did lose 10 pounds over that \"maintain\" year....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. So this spring I moved again, but this time for happier reasons, and I still stuck to it. Still maintained.... but then I started thinking that I was finally ready to be lighter than I had been since my early teens. My lowest weight since I was 16 is  247. Ironically, that is the exact number I needed to officially say I lost 100 pounds on keto. It would mean 113 overall from my top known weight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this morning I was at 247, into new territory that I haven't been in 15 years. 16/8 IF has really helped this past week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't need to worry about maintaining in the near future because my eye is on the prize. 190.

{"title": "My Story... 487lb to 364lb so far...", "selftext": "Here's my story... I've always been heavy. Teased merciless in school until I left at age 16 to get my GED and started working. At age 16 I was 440lbs and my weight leveled off around 465lbs. In 2005 I started working out, lost down to 425lbs then hurt myself and gained it all back. This had been my gym cycle. Every year I would work out, lose down to about 425lbs, but months later it would all return. This continued until 2017, and I had two wake-up calls. One, my doctor said he refused to treat me for anything (cold, flu, etc) until I lost weight at 487lbs, this after giving me a clean bill of health (yes, nearly 5 bills and not on any meds because everything was normal.) Two, the birth of my daughter. I had grown uncomfortably comfortable in my heavy size, but I wanted to be able to play with my daughter and I wouldn't be able to keep up with her. I started cutting back on my intake, cut out every drink but water and started going back to the gym again. This time I started going every day, and worked my way up to doing an hour of cardio and hitting 10 machines every morning. This helped me lose some weight but I knew my food intake needed more modifications. A friend of mine started keto and wasn't working out half as much and had overtaken me in the little competition we had to see who could lose the most. My wife, was a skeptic and still is, but reluctantly agreed to change up things so I could do keto. My work day lasts from 7am until 6-7pm some days so I'm at her mercy for my night meal and she refuses to just cook for one. I was losing fast with keto and my workout but due to financial reasons she had to go back to work and works from 4a-11a so my 4am daily workouts had to stop. Nevertheless I refuse to take the elevator in the offices I work in and I park my car far away when I go to places trying to get as many steps as I can in and as of this week I finally have my mountain bike together with plans to start riding on the weekends we're both off.

{"title": "I'm in the Army and this diet changed my life and makes me perform like a super soldier in the field", "selftext": "Hey all; this is my first reddit post ever.  I've been lurking around the last few months picking up bits of knowledge and I think I have a unique experience that may help people.  A lot of people pick up keto for extreme health reasons; I picked it up because my weight was going to ruin my military career.  It ended up giving me so much more.\n\nI've always been heavy despite intense dieting and exercise. After finishing my Basic Officer Course for the Army I was objectively fat due (270lbs) to weeks of eating MREs and panicked because I was given a slot to go to the Army Recon Course (ARC) with 8 Weeks notice. ARC is notorious for being crazy physically demanding and I was a to a point where I wouldn't be able to pass a PT test and there wasn't enough time to slim down and get in shape like I always had. I desperately buried myself in scientific studies on nutrition and found the Ketogenic diet.  It was basically the opposite of all the nutrition advice I had ever been given, so I met with a doctor to get my questions answered and schedule regular DEXA scans to track my progress. \n\nI ate roughly 2000 calories a day of amazing food and in 20 days I lost 15lbs (10lbs of fat, 5lbs of water) verified by the machine. By the time I reported to ARC I had lost another 5lb. I was also hitting PRs in the gym and felt phenomenal. I was a full believer by then, but I decided to stay on the diet throughout ARC and that was how I learned the true power of it. \n\nWhen I showed up to ARC I was still in bad shape compared to my Peers despite my progress. Our first field exercise was five 20hr days of rucking up and down ravines in the Georgia forests in full kit (80lb of gear and stuff). I ate pre-made keto meals at about 1200ish calories per day compared to my friends who ate MREs at about 3600 calories per day plus sugary snacks to keep them moving. Long story short, I completely outperformed them in ways I didn't think was possible. I had endless energy, no hunger, insanely fast muscle recovery, and extreme mental clarity when everyone else was droning out like brain damaged zombies. Everyone always talks about functional fitness; well this diet is a straight performance enhancer.  Anyone interested in combat fitness should try this cause it's just incredible.\n\nPic of Keto Army stuff:\nhttp://i649.photobucket.com/albums/uu212/bes5318/CFADF97D-4760-4612-B9B9-B3E6C8FED357_zpsdc46cjzc.jpg\n\n\nNow I'm down to 225lbs, 22% body fat (army tapes me at 17%) and I just keep losing fat while getting stronger and more athletic. My goal weight is 200lbs and under 15% body fat by January 1st and I'm well on my way to achieving it.\nI started Keto for the weight loss, but I'm going to stay on it for the athletic performance and overall health benefits.\n\n***UPDATE***\nMany are asking about the meals I packed, here's what they were:\nhttp://i649.photobucket.com/albums/uu212/bes5318/4A088E0F-338B-4B41-BE28-3ACA76D00974_zpsjvub6afa.jpg\n\nhttp://i649.photobucket.com/albums/uu212/bes5318/BA1A3314-E5B5-40F2-995B-3F2F30DD9A34_zpsni4bfcmc.jpg\n\n-2 tuna packets\n-2 cheese sticks\n-1/4cup macademia nuts\n-hot sauce/salt/pepper\n\nEach totaled to around 600 calories each.

{"title": "I almost kicked my waxer in the face.", "selftext": "Right before I started keto, I'd just discovered I had pre-diabetes. Two months before that I'd lost topical sensation in my calves. My doctor thought this might be the start of diabetic neuropathy, but couldn't know for sure.\n\n  \n\n\n\"If nothing else, I'd be quite certain the numbness is due to your health and diet,\" she said. I said that I was confused, that I'd been vegan for years, which was supposed to be healthy. How was I on a fast track to diabetes and all its horrifying complications? So I decided to switch from a low fat, high carb diet to a ketogenic one. \n\n  \n\n\nA month after going keto, my blood sugar was testing normal every morning. After four months, I'd completely reversed my pre-diabetes. I was amazed. However, my calves were still numb. I figured that the damage was probably permanent, and told myself that I was lucky it was only the inability to feel things touching my calves; it could have been a lot worse. My doctor took a \"wait and see\" stance, but I wasn't even hopeful about it, and I nearly forgot about it.\n\n  \n\n\nSo, now it's over a year in. I get waxing done for my hair removal needs, and have for a little while now. I hadn't been in for about six weeks, so when I got there my waxer and I were chatting quite a bit. I knew the drill, we were both having a good time talking, and I wasn't really paying attention.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, to be clear, when hot wax goes on your skin it's...well. Hot. I'm used that sensation everywhere but my legs, so when she went to start on those, I wasn't expecting to feel anything at all. She was in the middle of a sentence when she started applying wax to my left calf. And unfortunately she got interrupted...by me. By a shriek that could have broken a window, and my leg jerking up so quickly I worried I had kicked her in the face.\n\n  \n\n\n...because I \\*felt\\* it!!!!\n\n  \n\n\nAfter the initial \"are you okay?!\"s and \"WTF was that?\", I reached down and started rubbing my fingers over the skin on my legs...and I could feel that, too! I even smacked them a couple of times as though they weren't real. I hadn't felt anything in my calves for so long that they almost felt forgotten. It was like getting a piece of myself back.\n\n  \n\n\nNo waxers were harmed in the making of this post, thankfully. I didn't kick her like I feared, she's totally fine, and the worst of it long term is just going to be my embarrassment. I also tipped a bit extra as compensation for almost giving that dear woman a heart attack.\n\n  \n\n\nI have a long way to go until I reach my ultimate wellness goals, but this was an incredible reminder that I'm on the right track. I could recite a mile-long list of things that have improved since I went keto, but this one hit me the hardest for some reason. I'm so thankful I could cry. \n\n  \n\n\nTo all the keto newbies/New Year's Resolutioners, I really hope to be reading your success stories in the near future! Because you \\*will\\* have success stories. And to all the veterans, thank you for being so awesome in this community - without you I probably wouldn't have gotten to this point.\n\n  \n\n\nHappy, Happy New Year, everyone!\n\n\nEdit: Holy moly. I've never had a post \"blow up\" before; this was a really unexpected. Since this is on the front page right now, I want to answer a couple of questions and clarify something.\n\nI was vegetarian/vegan for almost five years (strict vegan for three). I went keto in December of 2017, and the first thing I incorporated was a whey-based protein powder. By the end of the week I was eating meat again. The first few days I was literally crying on and off through the day. I was terrified that adding fat the way I was would give me a heart attack on the spot. I hated myself for hurting animals again just because I was \"selfish\". The idea of eating the amount of protein my health professionals were suggesting seemed overwhelming.\n\nI don't feel that way anymore. I spent a lot of time beating myself up with every choice I made in my diet, and I've moved beyond that. I'm happier that way. I don't eat a whole lot of dairy, so I do eat meat for the majority of my protein. The rest of my diet is filled with a lot of low-carb vegetables and fats. I'm not anti-vegan. For the people it works for (including the vegan keto community), rock on - I'm glad it does. It just didn't work for me. And trust me, I spent years trying.\n\nFinally, my doctor had been giving her best guess, but admitted herself she didn't know the exact cause of the numbness. I'm sure she would have looked into it more if I hadn't turned my diet around so quickly. I'm still not home, but I'll definitely look for a test of my B12 levels like some have suggested (though I did try to supplement that when I was vegan).\n\nThank you so much for all the supportive and awesome comments.

It's going to be a long one.\n\nI have been very obese for a long time. I was hiding inside of my shell and wanted to be the guy that was never noticed. I drugged my sadness with Pizza, Soda, and Gummy Bears. Anytime I was frustrated with a work day I would leave work and eat late at night with some fast food and either doughnuts or a hostess pie. I continued to gain weight and I was so unhappy with the way I looked, I would not look at myself in the mirror.\n\nThis constant body mutilation I was causing myself led to health problems. My skin became very dry and cracked. I started to have problems with breathing and soreness throughout my body. I would have to get up at night and urinate like 3 times a night and I could never sleep well because of this. The final straw was I became impotent and I had swelling in my ankles.\n\nI had to do something. So this past February I started going to a gym that I had a membership to for the past 6 years and I have not stepped in the doors for about 5 of those years. I thought all I needed to do was exercise and I would get healthier. So I continued to eat the same and just workout. I thought I could literally have my cake and eat it too. I thought everything was going great but I was too scared to weigh myself.\n\nIn March, I lost my father who was 70 years old. He was only 125 lbs at the time of his passing. He had dementia, he was diabetic, and had severe muscular dystrophy that affected his organs. I was devastated with his death. I continued to work out and follow the same path I was already on. A few days after my father's funeral I got the courage to weigh myself. 389.4 lbs. is what the scale told me. I was extremely unhappy with myself and I continued to drown my sorrow in food.\n\nIn April my oldest brother told me his sad news. He was only 165 lbs and he looked like an athlete. He was already diabetic for the last four years and tragically the cancer he had in his intestines came back and spread to his liver. I was devastated and shocked, I knew what that meant. His days were numbered. The most shocking part of him talking to me was that he was more concerned about me. He told me that he did not want to see me in heaven any time soon. That he wanted me to live a long life. I told him I was going to lose weight and I have been working out for the past few months. I'll be fine.\n\nI went to work a day later and I was talking to one of my fav co-workers and I noticed that he was losing weight. He told me about this crazy diet about using fat as fuel instead of carbs. I thought this had to be the most silliest thing I ever heard. How could this work? Fat makes you fat! I know sugar would turn into fat but healthy carbs in like yogurt and cereal would not do that. I smiled and brushed off his story and advice as nonsense. A few weeks later in April, I decided to weigh myself once again. I was excited to see how much I weight I lost. So I stepped on the scale and I looked at that magical number...383?! Are you kidding me? I felt hopeless and devastated. The very next day I came to the conclusion that while I am heavy I must be healthier some way. So I went to the local grocery store and checked my blood pressure. 191 over 126. Fuck me!\n\nI wanted to give up. I was down on myself more than ever. I thought there was nothing I could do. I need to go to the doctor and get on like every medication out there. I can't do this on my own. On my way out of the grocery store, I walked by the magazine section and I saw this one fitness mag that was highlighting the Ketogenic diet on the front cover. I was at a low point, I am going to give into this silly thing.\n\nThe next day I told my coworker I am \"in\". He decided to be my coach in a way and make sure I would give it my best shot. The first week and a half I was drained. I barely had any energy to go to the gym. I was going to tell my coworker the very next day that I give up. As a good coach he is, he got on my ass and told me that If I quit I would have not truly given it a chance. He asked me If I weighed myself. I said no, I doubt I lost any weight since I could hardly work out and I have been eating fatty foods. He said in the morning to weigh myself. So, the next morning I decided to step on the scale and prove he was wrong. When I saw the scale my jaw dropped... 367 lbs! I was now fully bought in.\n\n\\--- The rest will be super short ---\n\nI have continued to stay on the Ketogenic Diet. (I have cheated about two days) Once I hit my goal weight I might try carb cycling with my workout days.\n\nI have added two different fasting protocols in my lifestyle.\n\nMy relationship with food has changed and I don't crave the sugary foods anymore.\n\nMy last blood pressure taken is 127 / 83 (It's Dropping)\n\nI am not diabetic at this time.\n\nI owe my life to my coworker and who I now consider a great friend.\n\nSad Note:\n\nMy brother passed away in October. I know he is in a better place where he is not suffering anymore and I know he is very happy that I made this change.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/a8p8g2/m4059389lbs_to_248lbs_just_over_9_months_on_keto/", "created_utc": 1545518158.0, "score": 1573, "author": "SweetbreadIsHere", "num_comments": 158, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/a8p8g2/m4059389lbs_to_248lbs_just_over_9_months_on_keto/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It's so crazy to reflect back on who I was a year ago and where I'm exactly one year later. Keto and intermittent fasting is not just a diet, it's very much become my lifestyle. I've struggled with my weight and binge eating for most of my adult life, and Keto was the change that allowed me to once and for all take control of my health and break free of the constant struggle with dieting and weight gain. I literally tried everything from liquid diets, to being vegan, not to mention therapy for binge eating. Keto was what made the difference and gave me the path to actually achieve the results I wanted.   \n\n\nI was so insecure and unhappy being morbidly obese, it ruined my social life, held me back in my career, I was constantly discouraged and had such a negative self image. The weight loss to me hasn't just been about regaining confidence, feeling good about myself etc. it also showed me how much internal power we have. The power of discipline, resolve and drive to accomplish goals.   \n\n\nI still plan on continuing my progress and shredding a few more lbs and going into maintenance mode.   \nI no longer see this as just a mechanism to lose weight, to me the mental shift that occurred which I think made all the difference is that I see this lifestyle as and habit/routine.

{"title": "280 lbs to 200 lbs! Progress update!", "selftext": "[Progress Picture](https://imgur.com/ffu6Ndp)\n\nI was a bit hesitant to share this because I still not completely where I want to be, but I figured since I met my first weight less goal I should share.\n\nThe first picture was taken 11/12/2018. I was not the heaviest I have ever been but I still hated how I looked. I was around 280 pounds. The after photo was taken today and I couldn't be happier!\n\nI have always been athletic and played sports pretty much my whole life. When I went to college I had kinda gotten burned out of exercising because I had never done it for the love of exercising. It was always a means to an end for me. So as one would expect I gained a ton of weight my first three years of college. After hitting 300 lbs I finally decided to make a change. That change wasn't keto though. That wouldn't come for a few years. \n\nI started lifting and I saw some menial results, but I never really changed my diet. I got to about 280 lbs and stayed there. In re-finding lifting I had found powerlifting. It was a sport that didn't care what you looked like as long as you could push big weight, which I could. So I used that as an excuse to not diet.\n\nFast Forward a few years to 2018. My aunt, who lived in Texas invited my father and I do her wedding. Needless to say we would have to fly. My dad was a very overweight man and used that as fuel to lose weight. He and my mom (she needed to lose weight so she could get a knee surgery ) started Keto in December. I also started a low carb diet, not keto, and found some decent results. Lost about 20 lbs. from December to June. That is when I switched fully to keto and I will never look back! We went on our family vacation and I saw just how much both my parents had lost and I was sold. \n\nKinda a long winded way to say keto has truly changed my life and just seeing posts in this reddit always picked me up when I was down and feeling like I needed a cheat. Thank you everyone for posting your progress pictures!

{"title": "The Chair", "selftext": "Hello friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  As I approach another ketoversary, I find myself beginning to ruminate on days of keto past.  Thinking of the things that have changed.  Remembering what life was so that I may appreciate what life has become.  And on the cusp on my ketoversary, I want to tell you about my chair.  \n\nOf course, I am BigTex and as such, the chair is not a normal everyday chair.  Here is a [NICE PICTURE](https://i.imgur.com/JyLCohj.jpg) of the chair.  As you can see, it is just a standard looking industrial type of chair.  Dirty.  Well worn.  Rest assured, the chair is special because it has a 1000 pound capacity.  Half a ton.  To put that in perspective, a Ford F-150 pickup is a half ton truck meaning that it\u2019s payload capacity is 1000 pounds.  So my chair will haul like a Ford F-150.\n\nWhy am I so concerned with a chair?  Well, because the chair represents so much in my life.  So much good AND so much bad.\n\nI bought the chair before I was a keto\u2019er.  Back in the days before a scale was in my world.  I didn't know my weight, but I weighed over 600 pounds.  Even at that svelt poundage, I could sit in that chair and not worry about it breaking.  That chair was a fat man\u2019s best friend because it was a worry free sitting down chair.  When you weigh over 600 pounds, worry free sitting is pretty damn nice.  It was really important for me because I couldn\u2019t stand for more than a couple of minutes without my back killing me so I did plenty of flopping down in the chair.  Very few graceful landings.  But the chair didn\u2019t care.  It held me like a champ.\n\nIt was during this time that the chair represented certainty.  Certainty that I wouldn\u2019t bust my ass when I sat down.\n\nNovember 14, 2016 I began eating a ketogenic diet.  I weighed 593 pounds that morning.  Threedom, twotopia, and onederland are phrases that we get excited about.  I was once excited about...well, what should we call it?  Five-A-Live?  Fi de Vivre?  Cinco de Lardo has a nice Tex Mex sound to it.  Anyway, I was excited to ONLY weigh 593 pounds.  I probably shouldn\u2019t put that line on my resume.\n\nFor some reason, keto fit me pretty well.  I often write to newbies about \u201chope\u201d because keto gave me hope.  Keto gave me the desire to stop existing and start living.  Yet I was still a big big big Texan.  And the chair was my best friend.  I couldn\u2019t stand very long, so I pulled the chair up to the kitchen counter and prepared meals.  Get up and stir food then sit back down in the chair.  Chop some more veggies while sitting in the chair.\n\nThe chair was a huge part of my life during this time.  The cravings were massive at times so I would clean.  Again, I couldn\u2019t stand very long, so I would move the chair to the center of the kitchen and sweep and mop while sitting in the chair.  I would pull the chair up to the sink and wash dishes while sitting in the chair.  I have a dishwasher, but washing dishes was burning more calories.  So I sat and washed dishes.\n\nI have a pretty cool kitchen table.  It is small and it folds and it works perfectly for me.  The chairs are NOT 500 pound BigTex Friendly chairs, so I ate my keto-riffic meals while sitting in the chair.  Eating keto and losing weight.\n\nIt was during this time that the chair represented freedom and hope.  Freedom from fat and hope that I can be the man that I want to be.\n\nToday, whenever company comes to visit me and space runs short, I sit in the chair.  It is too big for my butt.  Uncomfortable on my ass.  My back doesn\u2019t fit it quite right.  I tend to squirm when I sit in the chair.  But I NEED to sit in the chair every now and then.  I NEED the chair to be uncomfortable because comfort MIGHT create complacency.\n\nThe chair sits in the living room of the BigTex World Headquarters.  The BigTex Bachelor Pad.  People look at it strangely.  It doesn\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d the style of the room.  It\u2019s bulky.  It\u2019s \u201cinstitutional\u201d.  To the uninitiated, the chair is ugly.  To a visitor, there is no reason for the chair to be in the living room.\n\nMy new friends don\u2019t know that 600 pound Brian existed.  They don\u2019t know BigTex.  They just know that I eat weird and keep an ugly chair in my living room.  That\u2019s ok.  Today, I am the guy with an ugly chair.  My new friends won\u2019t understand the chair.  This is why I write about the chair to you.\n\nHello r/keto.  My name is Brian.  3 years ago today, I weighed 600 pounds.  No matter how bad you feel about yourself right now, I felt worse about myself.  And yet, as my fourth year of eating keto approaches, I sit on my sofa writing to you, looking at the chair.  I am full of hope.  Today, I have dreams that three years ago were not entertained.  \n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful chair because every time I look at it, I remember who I once was.     \n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful chair because every time I look at it, I remember who I am.     \n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful chair because every time I look at it, I see who I can be.\n\nIt's only a chair.

I knew immediately what it was as I have had several kidney stone bouts in the past. Typically the pain lasts for about 4 hours for me, but at the 10 hour mark I tapped out and went to ER just in case this was more serious. They loaded me up with glorious pain meds and let me know I was passing a 3mm stone. I finally passed it on Sunday morning. Sweet relief!\n\nSo...why am I happy? First off, Keto didn't cause my kidney stone - I've been having them since I was 18.\n\nMy last bout was 4 years ago. When I had that kidney stone 4 years ago the doc showed me my CT scan which showed my kidneys were FULL of stones. I was doomed to suffer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I've been on Keto I've learned all about electrolyte balance and how this can help clear up the kidneys and prevent stones. So I asked my doc what this CT scan showed. He said other than the current stone I was passing he saw two small slivers and other than that I was completely clean. I ended up passing the stone and the two slivers. I was able to completely dissolve and clean out all my kidney stone issues! Apparently this stone was the last \"FU\" of my kidney stone issues on the way out the door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso of note, at the hospital my blood pressure was 127/80.

I run my own business as a graphic designer, filmmaker, photographer and I do web design(when you\u2019re an entrepreneur you do what will make you money.) Anyways I decided after 3 years to get a part time job and even some people have sent me jobs, but I passed to pursue my passion. Well, UPS was advertised to me by someone I know who has been there for over 15 years and it was paying $18.75 for newbies during the season. I learned to drive a stick after sending my application off since the driver position had that requirement. I mean I was practicing on friend\u2019s manual cars for days and hours. I got it down pack just so I could pass the driver test. I went for the interview and passed that, did the driving test the same day and I passed it! I waited a week before following up to see when I would have to go to school, the HR person had no record of my driving test but took my word for it that I had passed. Awesome! I then was told to go to take my physical and DOT(some assessment for driving big vehicles or something?), and I would be going for training this upcoming Sunday in Lake Mary, FL. In the waiting room I was studying for the test, I was just super excited and determined to pass the assessments I\u2019d have to take while away at training. \n\nHere is where things got triumphant! \n\nThe cute young lady brought me to the back, she took my blood pressure (perfect!) I have not been to a doctors office in over 4 years, last time I went I got the worst results for everything and placed on high blood pressure water pills which I stopped taking shortly after. Anyways, y\u2019all! I had to get on the SCALE. I\u2019m not totally in the dark, but last time I stepped on a doctor\u2019s scale they just couldn\u2019t get my weight because I was well over 350 or whatever the limit was. This time the limit was 450 and not expecting much she took my weight to be 327. I got so excited she has to tell me to stay still, it was so nice to see those numbers! I promise! I did a happy dance, I explained to her why I was so ecstatic and she agreed it was awesome. \n\nNow, for the heartbreak... \n\nI waited for 10 minutes in the room for the doctor, stars in my eyes, on a high. The doctor came and asked me questions, I answered and he said to me \u201cyou need to have a sleep study done\u201d you are too much overweight and I can\u2019t pass you with that\u201d I confirmed what I was hearing, that I would not get this position. I pleaded like \u201csir I\u2019ve lost like 90lbs I don\u2019t need a sleep study, I guarantee. I have more energy and everything. I haven\u2019t felt sleep driving ever since losing this much weight. I can do this\u201d and he insisted my BMI was 43 and the disqualification was 40 and above. I was crushed overall that I wouldn\u2019t get the job. Like almost about to cry. I would have to be 295 in order to reapply for this along with doing a mandatory sleep study before I could pass. Well, I told the people at headquarters and they offered me a warehouse position and felt bad that I didn\u2019t pass the DOT. I was so happy about my result and so disappointed at where they landed me. A woman in the office on her own weight loss journey reassured me \u201cyou have to look at it positively because at least you\u2019re only 3% away that\u2019s awesome.\u201d \n\nI said I was going to keep it short, sorry I lied. But I got an old picture of me and needless to say I started feeling myself! Haha! If you read this far you\u2019re the real MVP! Pictures are 415lbs in Dec 2018 to 327 today, Oct 2019.

{"title": "Why Keto Worked For Me w/ Carb Counting, When Calorie Counting Didn\u2019t", "selftext": "Now don\u2019t me get wrong, keto works for weightloss if you are following CICO but I just really dislike when people like to simplify weight loss by saying just eat less, move more. Ever since I could remember, I\u2019d always been heavier. With both of my parents working I grew up on fast food (not saying I blame them, I just didn\u2019t know portion control and fast food is addictive so that's both on me and the food industry). I also ate to distract myself from how heavy I was which was just a vicious cycle. I was definitely a comfort and bored eater, eating out of depression and eating just to have something to do. From junior year of high school all throughout college, I tried various diets with just the simple concept that I had to eat more veggies, fewer fats and more exercise. You can guess I crashed from all that and just ended up binging because I felt so deprived and hungry. \n\nThen I discovered Keto and thank fucking god for that. \n\nThe lack of carbs and refined sugar really changed my tastebuds, where now I actually like vegetables more. Yes, Keto is restrictive but I thrived under those restrictions. Instead of focusing on empty carbs, I began to enjoy vegetables and not demonize fats. And because I was satiated on the increased proteins, veggies, and fats I learned what an actual realistic portion size was for me.\n\nBut there is a time where calorie counting is an absolute must. \n\nPersonally, I just don\u2019t really like calorie counting where I weigh everything and log it in. I can do it for a couple of days but not continuously. Being desi, my culture's food is very prominent in my diet but it's incredibly hard to calorie count on them because a lot of the apps don\u2019t have a database that accounts for a lot of our foods. Not to mention a lot of the places I go out to eat, don\u2019t even have any nutritional info. So no, calorie counting really isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds when the information really isn\u2019t as readily available as it should be. Carb counting was easier because I\u2019d just eyeball the veggies and meats were zero carbs, so whether I was eating my desi foods or eating out it was very easy to stay under the 20 net carbs allowed.\n\nFor the first 50ish pound lost, I did not count calories at all. Hell, I didn\u2019t look up my BMR until I got down to 145. However, the closer I go to my second goal weight of 140, the harder it was to lose without calorie counting. But at that point, I was in a better place where I understood nutrition better and was a lot more disciplined than calorie counting didn\u2019t seem like such a burden.  after I eat. Not to mention the sleep benefits and better skin. \n\nNow, I do not intend to continue keto after I get to my ultimate goal weight but will be transitioning into low carb forever. I\u2019d still like to have the occasional bread or pasta or rice dish but I don\u2019t want to fall back into the sugar trap. I\u2019m still going to eat my low carb tortillas and shiritaki noodles and monkfruit/allulose though. I absolutely love the feeling of not feeling bloated after I eat. Not to mention the sleep benefits and better skin. \n\nFor me, in a way keto was a \u201cfad diet\u201d in that it\u2019s a temporary thing that completely revamped my lifestyle and relationship with food. It was a drastic change from the SAD diet that I needed to get me off my unhealthy dependency on food, and unhealthy food at that. Diets don\u2019t work when you don\u2019t continue to use basic concepts of it when you go off them. I maintained 142lb for six months with no calorie counting and no keto, just utilizing what I had learned on keto (look at labels, macros, portion control, whole fiber foods, etc) So no, to the people that say you\u2019ll gain it all back after going off keto because you\u2019re not keto anymore, that's not true at all. You\u2019ll gain weight because of eating too much. Keto isn\u2019t magic, but it\u2019s an amazing tool to manage CICO. \n \n\n[Face Gains ](https://imgur.com/a/3AU2AHi)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/lgub7k/why_keto_worked_for_me_w_carb_counting_when/", "created_utc": 1612965957.0, "score": 1546, "author": "StableAbel", "num_comments": 190, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/lgub7k/why_keto_worked_for_me_w_carb_counting_when/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

(I\u2019m 5'5\".)\n\nThe first time around\u2014about fifteen years ago\u2014I didn\u2019t lose the weight with keto; it was more of a basic hate-yourself-and-eat-rice-cakes CICO diet. I got down to around 130, sure, but I felt pretty icky and tired a lot of the time. Then I gradually started eating more because I was always hungry, and my weight crept back up to around 160. But three years ago, I found keto because of Gary Taubes, and everything changed. \n\n(Imagine pictures of butterflies and rainbows here.) \n\nThe benefits I\u2019ve had ASIDE from the weight loss:\n\n* I no longer get acne. Up until keto, I\u2019d had it my whole adult life.\n* I have the energy of the universe, even if I miss out on sleep. \n* Speaking of which, I sleep better.\n* My teeth are cleaner.\n* My periods are lighter and easier, and my hormones have evened out (no more spotting, whoo!).\n* My hair doesn\u2019t fall out like it did before.\n* I WANT to exercise. Keto = magic. Keto + workouts = godlike powers.\n* I don\u2019t have a gallbladder. Keto FIXED my digestive issues. No more acid reflux!\n* My resting heart rate went down by about 25 BPM (before I even added exercise to the mix).\n* My anxiety and depression disappeared.\n* Best of all, I fixed my relationship with food. Now, it\u2019s fuel. Before, it was my lover when I was lonely, my comfort when I was sad. I don\u2019t feel the need for that as often anymore.\n\n\u2026And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. I have to tell you that being thinner and fitter is SO MUCH BETTER. People are way nicer to me. Men stare at me for the first time in my life (I\u2019m 41!). I feel like I can do anything.

I was being a dumbass and only went to the ER when it was clear that the boils were not going to heal on their own.\n\nMy foolishness cost me 5 days in the hospital, several thousands of dollars, two scars and weeks in followup care. The abscess on my back ate into my muscle and had almost broken through the chest cavity, where it would have easy access to the rest of my body.\n\nCome to find out, the sugar in my blood had effectively disabled my immune cells by causing them to be on alert all the time.\n\nSo if this had happened, I would have surely died. Not even broad spectrum antibiotics would have saved me in time.\n\nThe doctors wanted me to start on 10 units of insulin per day immediately. I decided to do my own research, which was arguably not a smart thing to do considering my previous diet and my hesitation to go the ER, to try to tough it out. But I had read this sub and r/ketoscience before this happened and decided to keep reading. \n\n \n\n-----\n\nI had a silver dollar sized hole on the back of my neck.\n\nI had a fist sized hole in my back. \n\n-----\n\nThey healed weeks earlier than anyone predicted. \n\n-----\n\nMy followup wound care doctor credited my \"miraculous\" recovery to the diet change, though he was concerned with the amount of fat and protein I was eating.\n\nI've long since stopped having the massive protein cravings and have gotten my macros dialed in. \n\n-----\n\nMy blood sugar high while in the hospital was 400. I didn't know I was diabetic yet (though I'm pretty sure subconsciously I knew) and I had ordered the juice tray because I didn't feel like eating. But I was surely a sugar addict and didn't know it/acknowledge it. \n\nAfter that, they restricted me to the diabetic menu. I ate omelettes and bacon from them on. Something told me not to eat carbs. I won't say it was anything supernatural\u2014most likely it was some subconscious part of me realizing that all the sugar I had eaten up  to that point was destructive. \n\nAnd luckily I did understand even then that all carbs were sugar at the end of the day. So right then and there I cut that shit out. \n\n-----\n\nI remember asking the dietician they brought in about keto and intermittent fasting, and she basically told me to just take my insulin and eat 3 meals of mostly carb a day.  \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nThis is also what the literature they gave me said to do. \n\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce I left the hospital, they had me on intravenous antibiotics for two weeks via PICC line.

If even a few of the bacteria survived and my immune system couldn't handle it, I'd be back where I started. \n\nThat's how close it came. \n\n**Do not wait to make changes you know you need to make.**\n\n**Oh, and I'm only 33. So don't think it can't happen to you yet.** \n\nMy aunt has it, and it runs in my grandmother's family, so genetics plays a role. But still, don't roll dice. \n\nDon't be like me.\n\n-----\n\nNow, eight months later, I've lost 50 lbs, my A1C is down from 10 to 5, my blood pressure is normal and my cholesterol profile is loads better.\n\nI only started exercising recently, so the change is 100% due to my change in diet. \n\nI require no insulin and no meds.\n\nYou can do it. \n\n-----\n[\nHere is a picture of me before I got sick and another from around 2-3 months ago.

{"title": "[Pics] Update! Recovering Binge Eater, 130 Pounds gone, 1 Year. Keto/Fasting!", "selftext": "[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/tyzNLET), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxBlOA0gA6s/),  And [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/aafelx/pics_update_recovering_binge_eater_100_pounds/)  (Sorry, I'm a month late posting all this)\n\nHey Reddit, my name is Cody and I'm a recovering binge eater.\n\nIt's been a year since I set out on my journey and oh boy has it been a journey.  I've come a long ways with my weight, emotionally (though with many bumps) and professionally.  I'm very fortunate for the progress I've made but I'd be lying if I said it was all easy.  \n\nI'm still doing well in the gym working towards my goals but admittedly I've digressed emotionally in the last 3 months.  Things in my life were going exceptionally well, I was thriving but I've had some major set backs due to some really unfortunate drama.  \n\nI won't go into too deep (mainly because I'm pretty sure someone involved knows my reddit) but I lost the closest people to me in my life and I've been completely devastated ever since.  It hurts so much because I worked so hard to better myself and I finally really opened up to someone, I took the risk to really get close to someone and now that person is gone out of my life.  And it's just really unfortunate because none of this needed to happen, I largely blame myself though because I handled everything so poorly when shit hit the fan but I know I didn't deserve what happened.  Looking back though the signs were there this wasn't going to workout long term, family's generally stick together and it was clear 1 of these friends wasn't okay with me having relationships with her family outside of her company. \n\nBut I know it's probably for the best that it all ended though but I really don't know where to go from here.  I feel such an immense amount of emptiness in my life that I don't know how to fill.  I'm terrified of getting close to people and trying to make new friends because I just don't think I can get hurt like that ever again.\n\n\n**But I will proudly say I never shut down** (I honestly almost did), I kept going and I've never lost sight of my goals. I realized if I shut down and give up all those horrible things that were said about me become real, I know if I give up all this hard work would have been for nothing.  \n\n\n**So what about my goals for this year so far?**\n\n - Get to 230 pounds: So far I've lost 30 pounds this year and put on a bunch of muscle so I'd say I'm certainly on track!  I've been eating much more than I was before but I'm also pushing myself way more in the gym.  Currently I'm squatting for 100 days in a row so next update I will let you all know how that went!\n\n - Go to school or improve career options: I pushed for a promotion at work and got it.  I still wanna go to school one day but I'm okay with the promotion right now as it's helping me get stuff together in my life. \n\n - Find the courage to get into a relationship:  Yeah this is the tough one.  As I mentioned above I'm terrified to get close to anybody because of all that's happened but might not be as far off as I often lead myself to believe.  I actually asked a girl out about a month, I've had a huge crush on her for years and she even said yes.  The difficult part is I was kind of just in a *mood* when I asked, I honestly didn't think she'd say yes and I've been terrified of her ever since so I never followed up :P   But it's really nice knowing that it's even a possibility. \n\n\n - Learn to play the piano:  I started lessons in March, I'm often too emotional to practice so I wish my progress was more but [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAXjQwKJKMA) of me playing my favorite song in the world (This is old, I can play better now but don't have a nice Piano at home to record a new video) (I'll donate 25CAD to a charity of choice to the first person to name the song). \nEdit* /u/tmwdysln got the song, [Comme des enfants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUI6Tvd1sA)\n\n\n - Help others with their weight loss journey:  I really wanted to do more here but I feel like I really need to get myself sorted out first.  I've tried making videos but I end up just crying and it turns into a mess.  But it's still something I really wanna do, I hope this post can help people out.  \n\n\nSo thank you all for the support over the last year, this sub has certainly helped me.  I go back very frequently and read the amazing comments you've all left me on the other posts.  My biggest piece of advice is no matter how hard things get, no matter how bad things feel please please just don't shut down. Keep pushing and working hard because I think we all know deep down that it will get better but it won't happen if you shut yourself down.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/byqwmm/pics_update_recovering_binge_eater_130_pounds/", "created_utc": 1560124517.0, "score": 1526, "author": "Ketchupkitty", "num_comments": 91, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/byqwmm/pics_update_recovering_binge_eater_130_pounds/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It was just over a year ago I decided to take my health back. Endlessly inspired by all your hard work and dedication, I wanted to be an inspiration to some of you too, in return. \n\nAs the title says, I bought a tube top. Me? Wearing a tube top? Never in my life would I have considered wearing something so revealing. That showed all my insecurities. I  just figured it was time to try something new. I reluctantly got a medium. When I got home to try it on, I held it up and thought there was no way I could fit in it. But I tried it anyway. It fit. Not only did it fit, but I LIKED how I looked in it! I just couldn\u2019t help but breakdown in tears. A year of discipline, ups and downs..I FIT IN A MEDIUM. It might sound silly to others but I know you guys just get it. \n\nOn the before picture It was April 2018, And I met Jeffrey Dean Morgan at Walker Stalker! I was SO excited and so happy. At that point I had lost 40lbs (started at 263) and felt great. Until I looked at the picture. I was embarrassed. I made progress but still so ashamed of how I just let myself get that big.

After a visit to my doctor this morning I thought I would share my good news and maybe that could help someone else.\nSo, about a year and a half ago, my A1C was 11.2, I was 240 pounds (after several years of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes) and my doctor was telling me that if it was still that high in 6 months he would have to consider starting me on insulin. A few months later I started cutting back on bread, pasta, candy and pastries (After listening to Joe Rogan and Gary Taubes). A year ago my A1C was 8.8. I did start feeling better, but it took me a few more months to really get serious. In July I started keeping track of my macros and exercising (something I never did) and when I got into ketosis I immediately started feeling great and losing weight. In August, my A1C was 6.5 and my doctor was really impressed. He cut my meds back and told me to keep it up. Now I am down 50 lbs. I went to the doctors this morning and he told me that my A1C is 5.4 and that I could stop all of my diabetes medication. I also stopped my blood pressure and cholesterol meds and he told me that that was fine too. \n\nI work construction and always struggled because it is physically demanding. Now, work doesn't suck as bad as it used to mostly because of the crashes after eating a carb heavy break and lunch. I always felt I needed a nap in the afternoon. So, keto made me not hate my job so much. I don't have before and after pics, but I'll see if I can dig up something that's not too long before I started keto. \n   \nThanks to everyone that posts on here, you have all been very helpful.\n\nI think that I should also add that I am 48 yrs old and I was diagnosed with Type 2 in 2006 I think.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7zxh9d/doctor_told_me_i_can_stop_my_diabetes_meds/", "created_utc": 1519488436.0, "score": 1528, "author": "peacemonger69", "num_comments": 87, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/7zxh9d/doctor_told_me_i_can_stop_my_diabetes_meds/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I haven't looked at my old photos, but I did this morning and began serious reflection! It's been about 7-8 months, give or take, between cheating and taking breaks due to mental health issues. I started at 230 lbs. These are a couple things I've learned between then and now!\n\n[BEFORE](https://imgur.com/a/Bgh7HRW)\n[AFTER](https://imgur.com/a/uAZVBk4)\n\n* Emotional eating is a habit that was planted into me since I was young enough to associate happiness with pastries/candy/comfort food. Breaking this habit (or resisting it) is essential to successful keto. Life goes wrong all the time. I've gone through SO much this year that resulted in me binging for weeks at a time, hating myself for it, and binging more. IT'S OKAY TO SLIP. If you're a food addict like me, relapses **are going to happen.** Be kind to yourself and just hop back on keto and reflect.\n\n* Do take photos along the way. When I was my heaviest I didn't even look in the mirror, let alone take full body photos. I have a couple, and started taking photos along the way. It's motivational, trust me. How you looked in July vs. how you look in October will be very different!! Celebrate that change with photos. :)\n\n* Although I am very close to 50 lbs down, keto is still a challenge for me. I live around all of my favorite foods (pupusas, tacos, chilli cheese fries, tamales... *drool*) and it still takes all of my willpower to go just put a burger over a bed of spinach and call it a night. Not everyone is like this, but if you are, it's okay! It's part of the journey to unlearn toxic eating habits, mindsets, and behaviors. Reading Michael Moss' *Salt Sugar Fat: How The Food Giants Hooked Us* motivates me too lol.\n\nThis is already too long, haha so I'll stop here.

{"title": "So, you guys like 1 year posts right? (100+lbs of fat lost)", "selftext": "[Progress Picture!](https://imgur.com/Fd0Yhr2)\n\nSo, I hit my one-year keto anniversary, I am supposed to make a post, right? This time last year I hit the heaviest I have ever been. 270lbs. Felt the worst I ever did. Every day was a struggle for me. Just like most, I flirted with the idea of Keto before, but never stuck to it for any length of time. I thought it was impossible. I thought I let myself go too far and could never recover from it. I just thought I was going to have to live this way for the rest of my life. In comes a few friends who want to try Keto and ask if I want to join. I grudgingly agree but with little faith of actually sticking with it for any reasonable amount of time. I knew the basics\u2026 and followed them for a while. I started to see the scale lower and was excited with the first couple weeks, as everyone knows, you drop quite a bit of weight at this time. As the summer went on, I started to get more into it\u2026 Still nothing serious. I would consider it lazy keto, not tracking anything but just sticking to low carb/zero sugar. Would chow down on chicken wings 3-4 times a week (a staple for me) and the rest some kind of chicken breast or red meat.\n  \n\nBy August, I was down to about 240lbs. I had a cruise planned with my wife for October so I started to feel good about my progress and now I had something to fight for. I wanted to look good for our cruise and finally feel confident enough to lay on the beach and not worry about what others think! In comes September. A really trying time for me. I find out my wife has been unfaithful and we separate. I am absolutely devastated by this. I attribute keto for my mental clarity and pulling me through this toughest part of my life so far. I never once stopped with my keto diet. It was hard, again, the hardest thing I have ever been through and I felt like at least this is a process I can control. Luckily, I have pretty decent friends and I still went on the cruise with a friend.\n\n\n I left for vacation around 210-215lbs. We had a blast. So much fun! This was the first time I stopped keto since I started on July 1st. My first \u201ccheat day\u201d (more like cheat week). Once we got back from vacation, it was back to the real world. I thought to myself, \u201cI need to keep going\u201d. I have to continue my weight loss journey and continue to just feel good. So, I continue on, not really keep track of anything and still losing a bit of weight here and there. \n\nNext comes Thanksgiving\u2026 I ate mostly keto-friendly food; my carb count might have climbed up enough to kick me out of ketosis but I weathered the storm far better than I thought I would. By December I have reached close to my goal, to be under 200 pounds. I was at 205lbs. I missed my goal, just by 5 pounds! That\u2019s it! 65 total pounds!!! I was super excited. At this point I thought to myself, I have been doing this for so long now, it is time to start getting serious. (By now, all my friends stopped doing keto\u2026 They dropped out one at a time, most stopping back in October/November.) \n\n\nI told myself, let's go a year. So, in January, I finally start deep diving into what my macros should be and how to maximize my weight loss. I figured all of that stuff out. I still don\u2019t keep total track and just eat with it in mind. I hover around between 200-190 for a while. It feels like I can\u2019t lose anymore. I start to get worried. Did I hit the dreaded plateau I read about on here??? Have I stalled? What is wrong? So, after reading about other people freaking out about the same type of situation, I realize, I am not keeping as close track of what I am eating as I think and I need to buckle down and Keep Calm and Keto On.\n\n\n At this point, I have a new goal. I want to lose 100lbs. within the year. I want to be down to 170lbs. How crazy is that! I see people losing that much on here, but I never thought I could be one of them. I thought I was just some fat shlub who doesn\u2019t have what it takes to get under 200lbs. let alone down to 170\u2026 Boy was I wrong. Anyone can do this. Everyone will have their own personal journey, but anyone can do it. \n\n\nI created a meal plan based on my macros. For the first time, I am telling myself I can only eat this stuff. Nothing else. Without everything else I went through, I would not have had enough willpower/discipline to stick with it. But I felt determined! Day in and day out, I ate the same thing\u2026 eggs for lunch\u2026 scrambled, fried, sunny side up\u2026 I got really good at making eggs. Different topping, cheese, sometimes salsa\u2026 hot sauce\u2026 anyway you can eat eggs\u2026 I have done it. For dinner, chicken thighs everywhere. Always chicken thighs (The occasional steak too). I have a million different spices and rubs now to go along with the chicken. Any flavor baked chicken, I have done that too. Mostly baked buffalo chicken thighs have replaced my chicken wing obsession.\n\n\n So, after a bit of this, I start to lose more weight. Slowly, but surely, I am making progress. I might have slipped for a day, in March (it was my birthday, give me a break) but it was right back on the horse after that. (What helped me was reminding myself, a cheat meal won\u2019t kill you. But do not rationalize with yourself about it. What I mean by this is, don\u2019t tell yourself, just because you had one cheat meal, let's make it a cheat day. Oh, I had a cheat day, let's make it a cheat weekend. DON\u2019T DO IT. It isn\u2019t worth it. The short-lived gratification you get from those sweets and carbs are not worth the longer-term crappy feeling you will get!!! Getting over that was very hard. I\u2019m not going to lie. It was an addiction. BUT, if me, some random normal guy can overcome it, SO CAN YOU. I BELIEVE IN YOU!!!) \n\n\nNow May rolls around. Just two months left until my goal! I am sitting at around 180lbs. I can\u2019t believe it. I am still just in shock over my transformation. Now I am thinking \u201ceverything is still so loose\u201d. My belly skin is loose and droopy, my arms are still jiggly (however, less batwing-like!!!  Anyone who has lifted their arms and waved or any form of movement for whatever reason know exactly what I am talking about here\u2026 not flattering.) \n\n\n To combat this, I am going to try and start working out! I have always hated working out. As it turns out\u2026 I didn\u2019t hate the way working out made me feel or hate the process of working out\u2026 I hated how I felt all the time and working out just made me realize that! I contemplated what type of workout I wanted to do. Swimming? Running? Weightlifting? Get a gym membership? Stay at home with some type of equipment?  I ended up buying a cheap rowing machine for the house. I start rowing. I read how great of an exercise and how low impact it is on your body. \u201cit uses 85% of your bodies muscles\u201d is what I kept seeing everywhere\u2026 So, I bought into the hype.\n\n\n I started watching YouTube videos and started practicing my form on the machine and how to properly do it. (This is important!!! I want to give a shout out to Dark Horse Rowing (YouTube channel).) Once I got the hang of it, I noticed I do not feel nearly as bad as I used to from working out! I actually feel fantastic and want to do more!! I can actually do this! I can reach my goal. I am not going to miss my goal this time. I am determined. So, for the month of June, I set a goal of 50 miles by July1st. I row and row and row. I just keep going. I set goals for my rowing time. I just want to keep getting better. I have never felt this type of drive before. I am motivated. I am motivated by\u2026me! I motivated myself! It took everything I went through, my entire journey to see it, but I am a badass motherfucker who can do anything I set my mind or heart to. I have never felt this type of confidence before. \n\n\nWell, here we are on July 1. 50 Rowing miles and one year later. 365 days. I am currently sitting at 172 pounds. I was at 170, but the added workout has sent me up past it and this is okay! 170 was just a number. I look and feel a million times better than I thought ever possible. I wanted to share this because I know some people on here feel how I felt when I started. You feel overwhelmed like you can\u2019t take control of your life. But you can. You absolutely can. Nothing is stopping you. I promise you, if you stay true to yourself and stick with it, no matter what it is. You will be better for it. You will have rough times and happy times. That is part of the journey. You don\u2019t have to be perfect. No one is perfect. Just try to be better for you. When people say it is a lifestyle transformation, it truly is. But you need to buy into it to reap the benefits. You need to buy into yourself.\n\n\nEdit: Formatting issue", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/c8n0ph/so_you_guys_like_1_year_posts_right_100lbs_of_fat/", "created_utc": 1562153758.0, "score": 1519, "author": "soakupthesap", "num_comments": 131, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/c8n0ph/so_you_guys_like_1_year_posts_right_100lbs_of_fat/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

From the last time I measured (mid-February 2019), these are my losses: 5 inches in my bust (43 to 38), 9 inches in my waist (41 to 32), and 11 inches in my hips (55 to 44). Pant size went from like a 22 to a 10 (maybe 8?)--I'm still wearing 12s that are way too big for me [\\#cheapgirlprobs](https://imgur.com/t/cheapgirlprobs). Tops went from a 3XL to a medium.   \n\n*Goals:* get in the gym and do some weight lifting/weight training. Are those the same thing? Idk. I want my thighs to squish watermelons. And I want to build my booty back up. RIP butt. I also want those abs that are starting to peek through to make their way out.   \n\n***FAQ:***  \n\n**What\u2019d you eat?** \n\n* I would typically have my meals follow this formula: protein + leafy green (or some kind of veggie) + cheese. Dinner tonight is going to be butter chicken, cauliflower rice, and some spinach on the side. I love spinach. Dinner last night (most nights) is a quesadilla (with some kind of meat inside) using a low-carb tortilla (La Banderita makes the best, imho), and a bunch of veggies on the side: cucumbers, spinach, pickled jalapenos, etc. I like sides.   \n\n**Do you work out?**  \n\n* I worked out 5x a week for like three weeks in April 2017, then didn\u2019t do anything for a few months, then started cycling and belly dance sporadically in October/November 2017. Then I did Krav Maga for like a month or two at the end of 2017, early 2018. Since January/February 2018, I've just stuck with cycling--I try to go at least 3 times a week. It doesn't always happen.  Considering most of my weight loss happened in Year 1, the majority of my weight loss occurred without much exercise.   \n\n**Did you cheat?**  \n\n* Short answer: yes. Longer answer: Yes, but not very often. I didn't do carb-ups, or whatever. I typically cheat around vacations. Essentially, all of my cheats were planned. I went into a cheat knowing it was going to be a cheat period, and I ended the cheat when I said it would end. Always felt bloated and sluggish, but when in Italy............\n\n**Where are your stretch marks?** \n\n* They're there! I've been fat my whole life, so my marks aren't dark or red, they are light and skin colored at this point. They blend in with the poor lighting and bad camera quality.   \n\n**Do you have loose skin?** \n\n* I sure do! Most of it is on my inner thighs, as cycling has slimmed those suckers down quite a bit. My inner thighs are super wrinkly. You can see some loose skin on my knee in my after picture. My inner arms are becoming bat wings--if I move too quickly, they slap me and I can hear them clap. LOL. My tummy doesn't look too loose when I stand up straight, but if I'm doing a plank BOIIIIIIIII it's loose as heck.  Even my butt is saggy and has loose skin. It's quite unfortunate, tbh. I'd like to get plastic surgery in the future to remove the loose skin and do something about my deflated boobs.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUm, I think that is it for now. If you have any other questions, I would be more than happy to answer. Keto is my lifestyle for good. I feel best eating keto, and I don't plan on going back to my old eating habits. If I hadn't stumbled upon this subreddit in February 2017 as I was desperately trying to find a way to lose weight, I wouldn't be here today.

I've almost hit an 80lbs loss, and I have finally found love with myself and my body. I have learned so much about myself in the last 51 weeks and I have learned so many ways to continue to succeed.\n\n\\#1: Don't give yourself an excuse to slip. \"I had a long day\" or \"it's my friend's friend's 21st\"-->DOESN'T MATTER. Long term success means planning ahead and always making the best choice. I'm in college, and there have been days I struggle when I'm stuck on campus and need food. But I make do, even if it's not as easy as grabbing chips. Put your health before immediate gratification. \n\n\\#2: Your diet will evolve, and you should try new things. Feels like I have tried just about every variation of keto. Zero carb, carnivore, IF, OMAD. Just keep adjusting, keeps the diet fun!\n\n\\#3: I am a recovering sugar addict. At the end of the day, my number one enemy is sugar. I will avoid this as all costs. I treat this a if I'm a recovering alcoholic, because honestly it really was that bad in my life. It's all or nothing on this one, and if you struggle with a sugar addiction like me, cut it out. For my birthday I want a nice steak with garlic butter.. not cake\n\n\\#4: Boys flirt with me now, I love that. \n\n\\#5: DON'T BUY NEW CLOTHES ALONG THE WAY. Go thrifting. Let's just say I  have donated quite a bit to the local community\n\n\\#6: You'll mess up, unless your a machine\n\n\\#7: Start lifting, trust me\n\n\\#8: KEEP IT SIMPLE. Forget the \"keto hacks\" and \"starbucks keto drinks.\" Eat whole foods, and focus on protein and healthy fats. There's no reason to rely on keto bread, which honestly isn't all that impressive (especially when you could eat a big yummy steak instead)\n\n\\#9: When people say \"oh I couldn't live without carbs, how could you give up pasta\" I now think \"I couldn't like without fats, who needs pasta\"--> super weird how your cravings change\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's absolutely insane to think I have 30 pounds from my goal weight and almost 80 pounds down from my starting weight.

It was hard as hell at first. Honestly it was hard for a long time. I have Binge issues, but I have been binge free for 26 months!\nI started at over 360lb. And it hurt to even wake up in the mornings. I felt like I was never full. I ate constantly and I was sooooooo hangry all the time. But I decided to try keto based on a friends' recommendation. \n\nSo glad I did that, now I'm 32 and under 200 pounds for the first time since freshman year of high school. Its glorious to wake up and not feel how heavy my own body was on my bones. Its been a trip yall. A real trip. Covid 19 slowed me down. I haven't lost weight since like February. But I haven't gained either. So Im hoping 2021 is a bit easier on us all. \n\nOne thing I have noticed about myself is that I do not DO outdoor cardio. I did everything but cardio all year. To make that better, I totally bought myself a little magnetic elliptical for Christmas. And the hubs got a magnetic rower and we already have plenty of weights, so we are just going to be adding cardio back in. Fx it helps us with the last little bit and we can get our cardio vascular health back on track! \n\nAnyway I mostly posted this because new years is coming and everyone is going to try to sell you a diet pill or a workout plan. You don't need it. Just stick to the principles of keto (so long as thats your decision diet wise) and trust it will work without expensive additions. I really hope you guys achieve all of your dreams. But also that you don't waste money on snake oil while you do it lol. I followed keto strictly for 6 months before I added exercise at all.

I subscribed to the sub because it sounded interesting then promptly forgot all about it. A little while later I decided to check it out again and the first post stickied to the top of the sub was an invitation to sign up for the six week challenge that was starting the next day, April 12th 2017. Six weeks seemed doable so I signed up. My goal was to lose 14.6lbs in those six weeks (to go from 194.6lbs to 180lbs) with an ultimate goal weight of 135lbs.\n\nWhen the final challenge weigh-in came around I had lost six pounds.\n\nIt was tempting to throw in the towel and say \u201cKeto doesn\u2019t work\u201d and go back to my old WOE. But instead I looked back on those six weeks and asked myself if I could truthfully say that I had done everything possible and I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t drinking enough water, I wasn\u2019t planning all of my meals, I wasn\u2019t weighing all of my portions- I was half-assing things and expecting whole-ass results. \n\nSo I signed up for the next challenge with the mindset of \u201cI can do better.\u201d I adjusted my expectations and set a new weight goal: 10lbs in six weeks. I ended up exceeding that goal by 3.8lbs and was thrilled. I kept it up for the next nine months or so- tracking everything, weighing everything, the whole nine yards.\n\nThen I reached what became known to me as the 144 curse. On February 15th 2018 I made it to 144.6lbs and was officially 50lbs down. And then I bounced between 145 and 144 for the next **two months**. To say I was frustrated is an understatement. I couldn\u2019t figure out how I could do better this time. I was tracking every partial ounce of food I ate and keeping up with my electrolytes and drinking enough water and doing IF even though I hated it and then, when I was staring down the pitiful macros of a 30% deficit, I asked myself if this was the life I wanted to live. Was losing the last 10lbs worth this much stress? The answer was no.\n\nI decided at that moment I was done. Not done with keto, just done trying to lose weight. I figured that, ideally, weight loss will be a very short chapter in my life and I wanted to start eating how I want to eat for the rest of my life. I knew I didn\u2019t want the rest of my life to be filled with measuring teaspoon~~s~~ of mayo onto my burgers or worrying about the fraction of a carb that\u2019s in my garlic powder. I just wanted to eat the foods I knew would make my body feel good (meat, eggs, dairy, vegetables) in the quantities that would keep me satiated. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nI stayed at 144 for another two months. Sometimes I considered going back to tracking but I never actually did it. I was happier this way even if it meant no weight loss. I weighed every week or so to make sure I was maintaining (I was) and then one week there was movement. Slowly but surely the number on the scale began to fall. \n\n\u2022 June 28th: 142.8lbs\n\n\u2022 July 14th: 140.2lbs\n\n\u2022 August 16th: 139.0lbs\n\n\u2022 September 10th: 135.6lbs\n\n18 months later I have finally reached the goal I initially thought I wanted to achieve. The number on the scale is nice, but being able to get there how I did feels like a much greater achievement. I learned that I can trust myself. I learned what actually matters to me (spoiler alert: it\u2019s not my weight). I got to experience a truly satisfying and sustainable life even though part of me felt like I didn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d it because I hadn\u2019t made it to my goal.\n\nThe best part is that nothing changes now that I\u2019ve reached my goal weight. I get to keep doing exactly what I\u2019ve been doing and I couldn\u2019t be happier about it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9esngg/18_months_later_195_to_135_nsfw_girl_in_bra/", "created_utc": 1536625512.0, "score": 1505, "author": "ketokate-o", "num_comments": 122, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9esngg/18_months_later_195_to_135_nsfw_girl_in_bra/", "html_title": ""}

I started doing keto because my grampa passed away on jan 1st from complications from an emergency quintuple bypass surgery. He has had heart attacks, him and his father both died young because of their heart health and it runs in my family. After a month of handling the death poorly, eating garbage and heavy drinking, I decided to change my life. Keto has changed my life. Aside from the obvious, losing a shit load of weight in the past 11 months, I have accomplished so much. I got promoted, I went off of my antidepressants and am no longer depressed, and I am happy and healthy. I changed my major for the final time and found my passion is nutrition. My blood work is insane, my total cholesterol is something like 125 and my triglycerides are somewhere around 35-40. My blood pressure is normal and was previously bordering hypertension. All better results than when I was 19.\n\nI have had ups and downs, more cheat days than I can count, and am not crazy strict, although I am somewhat strict. I work at starbucks and cant resist a few sips of a yummy drink or a bite of a pastry here and there. I think not being overly strict and allowing myself a bite or a sip has been really beneficial in staying so disciplined. Additionally it makes me feel like it is a life change, eating healthy, and I don't feel restricted. I don't eat super high fat, but I also don't shy away from it. My normal groceries consist of lettuce, spinach, cucumber, olives, eggs, sometimes bacon steak and chicken, and a few other things. I also eat those horrible russell stover candies and some ice cream like halo top, although I found a new one rebel creamery which is amazing. The other day when I hit 100 lbs I joined the gym, as a reward to myself. I have felt soo incredibly discouraged and still do sometimes, because for me the hardest part about keto is the hate it gets and my vegan coworkers telling me I'm gonna have a heart attack, which is a little too close to home for me.If you ever wanna give up because you are discouraged, you plateau, or whatever reason.. Don't because keto works and can be done in a very healthy way.\n\nI look and feel like a whole new person and in a sense I am.

{"title": "My anti-carb crusade/ how I lost over 200lbs", "selftext": "Here's a pic of me near the end of my first year\nhttp://imgur.com/IY70bke\n\nSo 6 years ago, I was nearly 4 years sober off heroin, about to transfer up to Cal after graduating with high honors from a local Community College, and felt, deep down, terribly unhappy. You see, while off of drugs I had switched addictions to food, and while I had been slightly overweight for much of my life, by this time (age 26) I had ballooned from about 220 pounds, to just north of 400. I had gotten to the point that I would buy fast food meals from one drive- through, hide the bags so the next drive- through wouldn't see them, grab some more food there, and park on some dark, deserted street to gorge myself in shame. In retrospect it was so utterly pathological, but I guess it takes hindsight to really gain that sort of perspective. \n\nAnyway, so by that time I was living in Berkeley, and trying to go to classes my first semester. I couldn't fit in any of the auditorium seats (plus the hell of squeezing past already seated students to some solitary center seat with a dozen \"pardon me\"s) or the desks (a single giant ass cheek and thigh would fit in one of those demonically- designed deskchair unit things, while the other took up an entire isle). I should mention I'm 6'2 and have a large frame as it is, so some friends tried telling me that I \"carried it well,\" which I know was just kind bullshit, and that the truth was I was rapidly eating myself to death. Not to mention, the social aspect of being so heavy. Let me tell you, the looks I would get from some people, the absolute disgust and contempt with which some would regard me. It was rarely overt, but just in their eyes, as they \"sized me up,\" in a literal sense. It's a very difficult feeling to contend with and I have a considerable amount of empathy for other folks struggling with obesity today. But it wasn't enough to get me to make any changes, and perhaps contributed to my overall depression that kept me consuming the way I had been.\n\nWith my newfound health insurance, I went to the campus health center (Tang, it's called) and got a GP to run up some blood work. I asked specifically for a referral to a surgeon for bariatric surgery, which, now insured, I had coverage for. I was done being morbidly obese, but I was insistent on taking the easy way out. Before he would sign off on it, he needed a full accounting of my weight and overall state of health. However, I maxed out the scale in the Tang Center, and the only one which could accommodate my mass was up in the Cal football training area. Thankfully there were only a handful of players in there, and the trainers knew ahead of time I was coming, otherwise my embarrassment likely could have proven fatal. Almost literally. When the number read 408 on the small, red digital screen, I mumbled something thanking them for their assistance, and walked (waddled, more accurately) out to my car as quick as I could manage. I remembered how devastating breaking the 300 level was for me a year and a half or so prior, which preceded a half-hearted attempt at going to the gym and dieting for a couple weeks, but the stretch marks spreading across my stomach told me I was failing and I gave up quickly.\n\n400 was something else entirely. In my mind, 400 was the sort of weight they made reality shows about, the sort where my life expectancy was basically cut by two thirds, and where, if I didn't act quickly and with conviction, I could expect to never attain any of the things I wanted for myself in my life. No girlfriend, no children, no successful career... my weight would get in the way of all that, and sooner rather than later, it would kill me.\n\nSo I doubled down on the surgery idea. The Dr. agreed, especially when my blood came back showing I was \"pre diabetic\" with high cholesterol likely contributing to my high BP. I was prescribed some BP medication, and with a BMI in the 50s, I was a prime candidate for bariatric surgery and he wrote the referral. I had been doing extensive research on the most effective weight loss surgeries, and for someone as heavy as I was, it seemed to me that what is known as a \"vertical sleeve gastrectomy\" would be the ticket to the body I desired. This surgery, unlike a gastric bypass, stomach stapling procedure, or LapBand, is absolutely irreversible, and involves removing up to 80% of your stomach and turning it into a sort of banana shaped tube from it's natural pouch shape. And severing the vagus nerve, which is a bad idea on so many levels. Because of it's greatly reduced size, patients who have had the procedure often need to take tons of vitamins every day for the rest of their lives to make up for the reduction in available nutrients, as well as constantly sip tiny amounts of water throughout the day in order to remain properly hydrated, as gulping any liquids will often result in vomiting. In December of 2011, I met with the surgeon, got assessed, and scheduled the surgery for the following March. The pics he took of me are some of the few photos I have of myself at that weight, and I need to get them from his office, assuming I still can.\n\nI should also mention that a month prior to this, and in a fit of desperation that began with me putting the barrel of my GP100 into my mouth one difficult evening, I had discovered the Silk Road and placed an order for some powder heroin, rationalizing my relapse by saying to myself \"hey, at least it's something new and not tar.\" Of course, within a few weeks I was back using tar again anyway, but regardless I had thrown away my nearly 4 years of sobriety and was now in an even more dangerous position health- wise.\n\nIn January of 2012, and flush with cash from my financial aid, loans, scholarship, and selling my beloved manual Volvo S60 T5 (no need to drive with BART, CalTrain, busses, and living within easy walking distance of campus), I visited Santa Cruz to see an old friend and buy an ounce of dope, with the plan to flip it to pay for my burgeoning habit. When I walked into his house, I recognized an old friend from high school (one of his wife's best friends) sitting on the couch, and was immediately speechless at how gorgeous she had become. It had been a few years since we had seen one another, and while I had always thought she was cute (honestly, she was one of those chicks every guy was attracted to back in the day, very much a flirt but with a good heart nonetheless) I always just considered her out of my league. We talked for a couple hours, about how proud they all were at my success with school, about my foray back into drinking and smoking pot (the dope was a secret only me and my buddy knew about at this point, and she being a brief, former meth user and current pot smoker, understood I think), and about my weight gain and surgery I had scheduled for a couple months away. Before I left to go pick up my shit, we hugged goodbye and said we'd see one another again soon, and while on the way to meet the dope man I could think of nothing but this woman and how amazingly beautiful she was. The kicker was the fact that she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was single, and while I didn't have any expectations on being able to get with her, I had to try.\n\nI returned to my apartment in Berkeley with a piece of dope between my buttcheeks and thoughts of this girl in my head. It's difficult to describe the effect that our chance re-encounter had on me, but over the next few days she was all I could think about. I realized that remaining obese in the way I was currently would ensure I would never have a woman like that in my life, but it did something else to me. I often refer to that realization today as my \"epiphany,\" as that's essentially what it was, but I had this massive revelation that, since I was the one who got myself into this situation, I could be the only person able to get myself out of it. Nobody forced all those burritos, hamburgers, gallons of juice, and pizzas into my mouth, and nobody else was going to be responsible for losing the weight either.\u00a0 \n\nIn hindsight it seems so obvious, but seeing her and how beautiful she was really drove home everything I was missing in my life due to my weight. So I jumped into action. First I went literally across the street from my apartment, where a collection of private Dr. offices were located, one of whom specializing in Subutex/ Suboxone. I paid out of pocket for a Subutex script, and detoxed in my apartment for a couple weeks off of the heroin, which I was intending on selling anyway. During that time, I devoured as much information on effective diets as possible, and that's when I first discovered keto.\n\nTo be honest, what I really found first was Atkins, although as I understood it, the lack of protein control initially advocated by this diet has some potential dangers. I was also interested in Paleo, which was relatively new if I recall correctly, and endeavored to create my own sort of hybrid diet between the two, essentially aiming to stay at an extended \"Induction\" phase of Atkins by getting less than 25g of carbs a day. Fresh off the opiates, I went shopping with a carb-restricted mindset for the first time and jumped into the diet headfirst. I was off to the races! I ate lots of bacon, eggs, avo, salads with olive oil and a bit of balsamic. For occasional treats I had a bag of strawberries in my freezer, and would eat a few of those as a sort of dessert. The switch in my drinking habits was most substantial; I was resolutely against anything other than water, considering I used to easily. go through a gallon of juice a day. But I was surprised at how satisfying the sparkling water could be, both the lightly flavored variety but even just plain Pellegrino and the like. I was also impressed with how good I felt generally, and how sharp my mental acuity appeared to be while on my diet. People have often held me to be of above average intelligence, but there was a definite added benefit in this regard while eating this way. I bought some of those ketone test strips to help me stay motivated and know that what I was doing was effective, and began with a light excercise routine.\n\nI started by walking a couple miles each day to a and from my classes, but within weeks I was up to 5 a day, and soon 10. I had (and still do) what amounts to a lifetime membership at 24 hour fitness ($20/ year, one of those awesome deals they apparently don't offer anymore) and started going there a couple days a week, but my walking routine around a number of blocks at night was definitely my primary workout.\n\nAt about 5 weeks in, and with my clothes noticeably looser, I decided to weigh myself for the first time. I headed down to the gym, looked hard for a moment at the scale, and held my breath as I stepped on. The screen flashed a moment, calculating, and then read 363 pounds. I had lost 45 pounds in little over a month! While I figured some of this was water, I was still excited beyond words, stepped off the scale, and went back to my apartment. These were the sort of results I had always needed to keep pushing me along, and they ensured my journey was further reinforced. I was even more diligent about sticking to my routine, and I put an indefinite hold on the scheduled surgery.\n\nBy late April, I was down to 291 pounds (still have the Facebook post to prove it, ha). Over 100 pounds in 4 months. Once I reached around 240, I seemed to hit a plateau, and so headed in to the Tang Center to try and get some pharmacological assistance. The same GP who had referred me to the surgeon walked into the examination room and took an approving look at me. \"So, I see you had the procedure, how's it going for you?\" He naturally assumed I had the VSG, and as I explained that I had cancelled the surgery and lost the weight via carbohydrate restriction, his shock was obvious. I've never seen a physician so happily incredulous in my life, and as I asked whether this was a healthy eating routine, he stated plainly that I should \"Keep doing whatever it is you're doing, you've just added 30 or 40 years onto your lifespan dude.\" He was even happy to write a prescription for the weak amphetamine analog I asked for by name to help break through the plateau, which in my experience is rare for Doctors to do, although I later found that cycling off and back on a ketogenic diet broke through much more effectively. He also took my blood again, and I was no longer pre-diabetic, my cholesterol was normal, and my BP was in a healthy range and so I could come off the metoprolol.\n\nThere was a bunch of stuff that happened during this time, and the years since... my failures around dope and addiction, having to do a medical withdraw from Cal to go back to rehab, eventual homelessness following another relapse, IV use, overdose, and consistent criminality. My lowest weight was a sucked up 170; ironically too skinny for my size. But I've got 5 months sober today, am back working a strong program in a 12 Step fellowship, and am back on a ketogenic diet when my weight grew from 200 to 240 in my first 4 months of sobriety. I'm back down to 220 though, and know with conviction that I am absolutely in control of my body. I feel good, all things considered, and I like the direction my life is headed. \n\nOh yeah, that girl. It would be too perfect to be able to say we got in a relationship with one another, but she picked up another boyfriend shortly after our initial encounter (he another friend from high school and a great guy altogether). They've been together for 5 years now, and I couldn't be happier for both of them. Tomorrow (Sept 3rd) will be my 3 year anniversary with my girlfriend, who is also sober today, and I wouldn't trade her with that initial girl for anything. I think life often works out exactly the way it's supposed to in the end, and as my mom says, 50% is given & 50% is claimed. You just have to find that resolve to claim yours, and the rest falls into place naturally. Don't give up on your journey, and know you absolutely have the power to achieve your goals, no matter what they might be.

{"title": "I got angry today...", "selftext": "I have been on Keto since Monday - I am an educated and intelligent guy, with a great job, gorgeous wife and nothing much to complain about.  I have struggled with my weight for about 20 years but towards the end of 2016 I decided to do something about.  I was getting married the following March and set a goal to lose some weight before the wedding - it was a dream wedding on a beach in Mauritius - so obviously I wanted to look good and at 110kg with a fiance who is 60kg wet - I wanted to look good for her as well as myself.\n\nSo I got a personal trainer and hit the gym 5-6 days a week for 2-3 hours a day doing very intensive strength training + cardio and on a very strict macro controlled diet (protein/carb based) as well as a bunch of supplements.  I won't lie, it was hard as fuck - but it worked, I got to 96kg in 4 months and gained a lot of muscle; and our wedding was magical.\n\nThe problem is, I then had a lot of travel with my job for the rest of the year which meant my diet and training regime basically went to shit - hard to keep control when you spend over 180 days of the year in airports and hotels, so I just yo-yo'd, now back up to 115kg.\n\nNow I have a bunch of friends in Canada (I live in Sweden) who have been doing keto for a couple of years and they look fantastic - I mean absolutely fantastic; so I started to do some research a couple of weeks back on Keto myself.  I do about 30-50 public speaking engagements a year - I don't want to be a fat bastard on stage in front of thousands of people, I want people to focus on what I am talking about, not how out of breath I am or how much I am sweating because I am obese.\n\nSo I researched (and when I research I research hard) and as someone who works in Human Rights, I became disgusted with the death we have all been sold for the last 40-50 years.  The conspiracy that exists between sugar industry, processed food industry, big pharma, academia and government to ensure that we keep filling our lives with carbs just really pisses me off.\n\nThen today, when I went to 3 supermarkets to stock up on my keto friendly food, I just became furious.  Every single aisle full of sugar and carbs - every single planagram designed to make you eat more sugar and carbs.  The candy aisle, the icecream aisle, the bread aisle, the cake aisle, the baking aisle, the chips aisle, the packaged food aisle - everywhere I looked all I could see was sugar and carbs.  It is twisted beyond belief.\n\nAnd it occurred to me - the thing that people have often teased me over for years is my love of meat and dairy (cheese more specifically) - I shit you not, I was once dumped by a girl in college because she claimed I ate too much cheese - this love of meat and cheese wasn't a bad thing, it was my body crying out to me to eat the right fucking food.\n\nSo yeah, those of us working to meet our goals, to lose the pounds/kilos - to have a healthy body and mind; we call ourselves fat, we have low self esteem and negative body image - but we are all victims.  We didn't choose to be this way, we were farmed like cattle by these industries and our own governments.\n\nSo I am not ashamed any more, I am determined; determined to be my own person and to be natural.  I read earlier this week that we have gone from an average consumption of 5lbs of sugar per year to 150lbs in the last 160 years and that the sugar lobby spend more money than the tobacco lobby - I mean seriously, wtf?\n\nSo I want to say thank you to everyone here who has shared their story (it is incredibly inspiring, no seriously - those before and after pics are completely mind blowing) and to those who have developed the knowledge resources, the tools and support infrastructure which gives us all the opportunity to take back control of our lives.\n\nI have just started my journey - but my eyes are wide open and nothing motivates me more than raging against the machine, so I \\*know\\* I will succeed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bmm78b/i_got_angry_today/", "created_utc": 1557420881.0, "score": 1491, "author": "ThinkPrivacy", "num_comments": 437, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/bmm78b/i_got_angry_today/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I lost 120 lbs last year, thanks to keto and exercise and I couldn't be happier.", "selftext": "Hello to whoever reads this. I am so glad to post here today. I spent quite a lot of time lurking on this subreddit last year, responding with throaway accounts and generally absorbing a lot of knowledge  from you guys, and in my case it was better than absorbing more carby foods. Because last year I was obese.Very obese and unhappy indeed.\n\nI created this account just today, I have finally reached my goal weight and it's only fair to pay tribute to this subreddit as it fueled my motivation and helped me to stay on track. I was 282 lbs last year, 159 right now and it feels great. When I discovered keto everything changed, it was the first time in my life that I could feel satiated while on a diet, and it worked wonders thanks to that. At first, I believe that eating a diet that was by essence pretty high in fats would be detrimental and counterproductive, but after doing my research (here mainly) I gave it a shot. It thought that it was just for the hell of it, that I would quit within weeks just like any other diet I had been on since my teenage years. But I was surprised about how easy it was to keep going, I also discovered so many different ways to cook, so many spices that I now love ( a little paprika in an omelet is amazing try it).

{"title": "Be the best version of yourself!", "selftext": "**My stats of course:**\n\n28f/5'3/SW165/CW128/GW121\n\n28f/160/SW75/CW58/GW55\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnglish isn't my native language so I'm sorry for any mistakes I make. Brace yourself, long post ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Back story**\n\nI've always had a normal BMI. I remember graduating High school 115 pounds (52 kg). A close friend back then introduced me to pizza, pasta and all kinds of high carb food that were uncommon in my household. So naturally I gained a few pounds, I was around 136 pounds (62 kg) but I actually enjoyed the way I look - I got nice round thighs and cute butt. I stayed the same weight for the next four years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The weight gain**\n\n2013 turned out to be awful for me. I went on a 3 month exchange program in the States and had horrible experience. When I came back home the bad memories triggered depression, anxiety and panic attacks. I was consulted by psychiatrist after psychiatrist and no one seemed to take me seriously and see that I have a problem. All they did was prescribe new meds or change how much should I take. The drugs didn't help so after 6 months I decided I had enough. I stopped taking my pills and started battling depression on my own. For the next two to three months I gained around 30 pounds (13 kg) without changing my diet or having extreme cravings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The wake-up call**\n\nI did try to lose weight. Maybe at first I was in denial how I look and how heavy I was because despite the extra pounds I still had the skinny girl mentality. My confidence didn't suffer at all I was still feeling sexy and beautiful. And then when I went shopping, I'll always pick sizes too small for me and be sad looking at my image in the changing room. I really wish that was the wake up call or the lack of intimacy in my relationship but it got worse actually. Despite hitting the gym for almost a year and being careful with what I eat, I didn't lose a single pound. In 2016 I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in March 2018 after a check up I was told I'm prediabetic. And that was scary. I was prescribed a metformin type of medicine and was told I must lose weight. But no one bothered to tell me how exactly. My doctor told me to stop eating sweets, bread and drink coke. The irony is that I dislike sweets, don't eat bread and find the taste of coke nasty. So the advice was to change nothing, take my pills and hope for a miracle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The change**\n\nOn a different sub someone mentioned that IF helped them lose weight. I didn't know what IF was. I've always been taught that skipping meals is bad and my body will go into starvation mode. Or that my metabolism will slow down. My mom was telling me how I should eat 6 small meals a day. Surprisingly she's in a really good shape following her own advice. Usually I have difficulty eating in the morning, so skipping breakfast and just having black coffee seemed doable. So mid-March 2018 I started eating from 12 to 7 pm, two meals a day. The first week was tough - listening to the tigers fighting in my stomach was quite embarrassing at work. Now not eating in the morning is the most natural thing for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Keto**\n\nIF helped me lose 11 pounds (5 kg) in 6 weeks (not sure how the weight loss was influenced by the pills I was taking). I was happy but I felt like I wasn't doing enough. Then I saw a post in r/intermittentfasting how keto and IF go so well together. Plus keto had addition pros like improving ones mental state and I could really benefit from that. I was already eating lower carb so I decided to fully commit in the beginning of May 2018. I've read everything about the diet, bookmarked a ton of recipes and full prepared to suffer the keto fly. Which never actually hit me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Macros**\n\nClosely tracking my food was difficult. I've tried several apps but putting the amount of food I ate gave me so much anxiety that I quickly quit. Instead I found googling the nutritional values per 100 g of something so much easier and stress-free. Even before keto I loved meal prepping so now once a week I'll measure the food, cook two or three dishes depending on my budget and then portion it into boxes for lunch and dinner. Although I did know how much calories I should consume I mostly ate until satiated. Which often led to OMAD (and a lot of frozen premade meals). During the first month I learnt the hard way I need more potassium and magnesium after my legs started cramping. I took the supplements for a week and then stopped. I'm feel great ever since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Plateaus**\n\nI've read so many people complaining they stopped losing weight. For me plateaus were a blessing because it meant I could lose a certain amount and actually maintain that current weight instead of going backwards. In my experience the easiest way to break plateau is a longer fast - 36 or 48 hours (I do know that is not for everyone). But plateau definitely something I don't stress about. Being short, I can actually see in the mirror the difference every kg makes and take this time to get used to the new me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cravings**\n\nAs I mentioned, I don't like sweets like chocolate or cake, so in that department I was good. I don't cook keto versions of carby foods. The only thing I miss are potatoes, chips in particular. But lately I've notices I actually crave the salt and the crunch not the potato itself. Eating something keto friendly with extra salt does the trick (pickles are a blessing). During the summer I had a cheat meal at a wedding. Without drinking alcohol I had the worst handover/brain fog in my life the next day. It's not worth it guys, eat some bacon when you have a craving, your body will thank you later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros**\n\n\\- Losing the weight - I'm no longer prediabetic, my blood tests are perfect;\n\n\\- Feeling normal; Reduces to non-existent anxiety  - Before keto feeling stressed and anxious was the norm, now being \"just fine\" is the best thing ever. I'm not overly happy or ecstatic, I feel like myself\n\n\\- A lot more energy, no longer feeling sleepy after a meal;\n\n\\- No brain fog;\n\n\\- Less hair loss and a lot of new baby hair;\n\n\\- I sweat less;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons**\n\n\\- Dealing with annoying people who are uneducated and overly-concerned about my eating habits;\n\n\\- Buying new clothes if that even counts as a con (I really hate shopping);\n\n\\- With the change of seasons where I live, I feel colder than usual;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What stayed the same**\n\n\\- My skin is the same but I've never had issues to begin with;\n\n\\- My period is still regular - I was hoping it'll get less painful but oh well...;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nKeto quickly turned from a diet to a way of life. I'll continue eating low carb because it's no longer about the weight loss or the weight maintenance, it's about this new state of mind that I have. I love waking up rested before my alarm goes off. I love feeling calm and collected and not being afraid of the day ahead. I love how changing my diet gave me control of my life.\n\nI can't express how grateful I am that this sub exists. Now my favorite part of the day is reading your amazing and inspirational stories with my morning coffee. Don't give up if you're struggling with plateaus or people not being supportive. Recalculate your macros every 10 pounds or so, try and educate the ones close to you. It's all worth it in the end, being the best version of yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank you for reading!**\n\nEdit: spelling", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9ze0cb/be_the_best_version_of_yourself/", "created_utc": 1542892521.0, "score": 1490, "author": "KetoCorgi", "num_comments": 127, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/9ze0cb/be_the_best_version_of_yourself/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "64.2 pounds down, 10 days away from 3 months", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/9vzVMBY \n\nTLDR; I\u2019ve lost 64.2 pounds on keto! More than I lost weight calorie counting alone. \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f I\u2019m super sensitive about my \u201ctummy\u201d pictures, but I felt like they add a lot of important information to my before/after so I added them anyway. \n\nIn 2015, I started calorie counting. Over the course of 6 months I was able to lose 50 pounds, and I felt fantastic. I had so much more confidence than I had ever had in my entire life, I appreciated all of the little things, and exercise seemed to be a hobby rather than a chore. When I hit that 50 pound mark I celebrated with a very large cheat day. That day turned into a week, then a month, and eventually 4 years. To this day, I still regret giving up on myself. I told myself that the weight was coming back on no matter what I did, but I never took responsibility for my bad eating habits. \n\nIn 2019, this year, I decided to make a change in March 25th. Today it is 2 months, and one day short of 3 weeks later and I have lost 64.2 pounds with the help of keto. Not only have I surpassed the weight loss that took me 6 months to achieve previously, but I also can\u2019t see myself cheating any time soon. I have 12.7 pounds left to lose until I hit my lowest weight of 2015. And when I get there I will celebrate! However this time I\u2019ll celebrate wisely. Instead of choosing to binge eat any food in sight, I\u2019ll make a keto friendly dessert and enjoy myself properly. When I hit 100 pounds down, I plan to schedule a photo shoot to celebrate my hard work. But this time, I won\u2019t let myself be pulled back in to the bad habits that have controlled me throughout my entire life.\n\nWhen I started into 2010, I was at the heaviest weight of my life, starting anew and scary program in school, was getting the hang of a new job, and I was terrified about where the year would take me. Now here I am halfway through, excelling in school, excelling at work, and excelling in getting control of my own health. Sometimes life seems terrifying. Sometimes it\u2019s hard and scary to make a change. But sometimes you\u2019ve got to just take life and decide that you\u2019re going to win at any costs. As of now, I can\u2019t wait to see where I\u2019ll leave 2019. I have no fear, only excitement, and I hope I can help others find the same confidence along their own journey. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9vzVMBY", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/c0o6gx/642_pounds_down_10_days_away_from_3_months/", "created_utc": 1560540345.0, "score": 1492, "author": "BuiltLikeAPotato", "num_comments": 115, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/c0o6gx/642_pounds_down_10_days_away_from_3_months/", "html_title": ""}

If you are just starting out, or are thinking about it, I know the road looks long and dark, and you aren\u2019t sure if you can make it work.

I basically ate every time I craved anything or felt hungry. I also ate to cope with stress. Before I knew it, even years after I graduated, I ballooned to 175 lbs. I started to notice how much I\u2019ve gained when I felt embarrassed looking at pics of my face, then at some point, I noticed I couldn\u2019t even cross my legs. Seeing 175 lbs on the scale broke me. I was really unhappy with myself and how I just didn\u2019t take care of myself, so I started keto with my now bf in august 2020. Had a bit of a hiccup during the holidays, but got back into it in January of this year, and MAN it felt so good to see the difference. I\u2019ve lost around 35 lbs, and I feel much more confident in myself now. I feel great when I look at myself in the mirror or in pictures. I\u2019ve kicked sugary drinks. I drink diet or zero sodas/teas now, and I honestly can\u2019t tell the difference so I don\u2019t really have a reason to go back. I\u2019m much more mindful of my calorie intake. I feel hungry less often now. I actually feel energized in the morning. I think the best part of keto so far though is that some of my clothes from high school fit me again. Dude, I just feel sexy lmao\n\nI wanna lose like 5-10 more. My goal is to get down to the weight listed on my drivers license at least lol. \n\nI\u2019ve never stuck with a health goal in my life until keto and weight loss, so I\u2019m hella proud of myself for the restraint and control I\u2019ve shown to get to where I am. It\u2019s crazy to see your hard work pay off. Hell, I think I\u2019m gonna start some more guided exercises so I get toned.

I wanted to share my story with you.\n\nI've never cared to actively draw attention to myself, unfortunately, my absent father's genetics were far from absent in my pubescent years meaning I've grown to be a 6'4\" member of those social elites gifted with the ability to see dust on top of refrigerators.\n\nBeing this tall was already plenty to keep me from being able to fly under the radar of the many cruel youths that roam the halls of sleepy small town public school. Add on to my chandelier-forehead-smashing height the fact that I had size thirteen feet before I had even lived thirteen years. \n\nOn top of that, puberty hit me like a truck, and by truck I mean like a dump truck full of hair. When kids were showing off their first arpit hairs I already had my shoulders filling in nicely.\n\nSo there you have a young adult sasquatch trying to avoid detection from the poachers wielding rifles loaded with insecurity and fear. What could possibly make hiding more difficult for that self-conscious teen monster? \n\nFat Giant Hairy Kid. \n\nI've been overweight a lot of my life. When I was eleven I had the first of two surgeries that involved sawing each of my femurs in half and screwing them back together. Unlike my youthful expectations, this procedure was not to give me bionic legs with the ability to leap over buildings and win track meets to impress girls, in fact it temporarily turned my legs as useless as a hat underwater. I ended up quitting all my physical activities because I was embarrassed about falling behind. \n\nThis was the start of a not-so-beautiful katamari tumbling and gaining momentum. The pounds came fast. I've been obese for most of the time that I've been actively making memories. \n\nWhen I started Keto as my New Years Resolution this year I honestly don't know what I expected, certainly not for it to work as well as it did. This has been both far simpler than I ever anticipated, while also being one of the most challenging and fulfilling things I've ever done. \n\nWhen I started [I was a big boy](https://imgur.com/2pSfzlg) consistently adjacent to that 300 pound mark. You can just see in the picture that at that point I was more beast than man. Eyes glossed over with that carby glaze. Shovelling bread into my mouth like it's going to smother the smoldering self-loathing that coats my insides. \n\nMy mother took that picture of me, and I hated it. I hated every picture of me, I could never look at myself without cringing and seeing all the things that the other people saw. I've always had a huge mental barrier between myself and photogtaphs that pushed me to avoid any documentation that made real how physically different I look to what \nmy brain feels inside. \n\nMy mother took [a lot of pictures of me](https://imgur.com/tNEt0lx) on our trip to egypt at the end of 2016, I had read about Keto that summer and talked to my girlfriend about trying it, expecting this to be just another thing I talk about and consider but don't follow through on. [Those pictures though](https://imgur.com/6SaEEQQ), they just got to me. Here I had gone on this amazing trip across the world, and I didn't anyone to see any of the pictures. It just felt like a giant monument to how much I had let things get out of control. \n\nI started Keto January 1st 2017, hard. My girlfriend did most of the legwork when it came to recipes and shoping lists. I'm hugely grateful to her, and to all of you. for the support and motivation to just do the dang thing. \n\nI started at 302 lbs, 44 pant size, xxxl shirt. I'm currently 190ish, 33 pant size, large shirt, and honestly I stopped checking the scale. The mirror brings me more than enough joy now to keep me going.\n\nI think the most unexpectedly huge change has been psychological. At long last, I like what I see when I see myself. I can finally genuinely look the way I want to when I buy new clothes. My mind is finally finding a synchronicity with my identity that's giving me confidence-gains such that I could swear I'm just intravenously connected to Dwayne the Rock Johnson's ego.\n\nMy mother [took another picture of me today] (https://imgur.com/QEKijKb) while she was visiting for Canadian Thanksgiving. It's finally really set in what I've accomplished. The fact that I can see a picture of myself without cringing fills me with so much glee that it's pouring out into this keyboard. \n\nI'm sorry, I've been rambling, I just really wanted to thank you guys for helping me, and share a bit of myself with you.

I\u2019m 43, perimenopausal, hypothyroid, and in birth control (for the peri) so I thought I was doomed to be overweight. I had accepted it. I had bought the plus size clothes.

I was achy and sore and bloated and uncomfortable and one day I saw a man drop dead of a heart attack in a trampoline park and was like NOPE. I have to do something. I knew low carb had worked for me in the past but I found it hard to sustain. I still craved carbs. I was searching for different variations of low carb and found this sub. Wait, I can have cheese, I can have dry wine? And something about the binary nature of keto clicked for me. Either I\u2019m doing this or I\u2019m not. Then it was off to the races. I decided to judge myself by how well I stayed Keto - and aimed for a streak of logging in on MyFitnessPal. I focused on the inputs. Yes weight mattered but I tried not to let it stress me out. \n\n10 months later, my spouse has joined me and also has lost almost 50 pounds as well.  We both see this as a way of eating for life. No desire to go back to carbs. \n\nNow I need to set some new goals. I kinda don\u2019t want to lose too much more because I really don\u2019t want to have to buy new clothes! So I think I will try to maintain or very slowly build muscle and lose a little more fat. \n\nI visited this sub pretty much every single day. It sustained me and gave me inspiration and support.

We'd tried it all: 4 Hour Body, 5 Bite, Low Fat this and that, cabbage, Soup, everything. Why would we assume that Keto was any different?\n\nSo we sat on it, even though my wife bought the Ketonix stick. We sat, waited, and stuffed ourselves with all sorts of horrible foods that made us in turn feel miserable. Every meal was followed by a lengthy meat sweats session and a debilitating \"heavy\" feeling.\n\nWe hated ourselves for allowing our eating habits to ruin our lives. We never left the house, rarely took pictures, and our relationship suffered immensely. \n\nThen we tried Keto and, sure, it was a little dodgy at first. We had to figure out how it worked and where our carb limits were, but then we discovered a few low carb stores in our area and suddenly life wasn't so different. I believe that's what made it click for us. We weren't rolling up slices of lunch meat and cheese- there were sandwiches. i could make tacos with low carb tortillas and hot dogs on actual hot dog buns. \n\nSo here we are- my wife has been keto for 15 months and I just passed my year (I wasn't quite sold on it until I saw her success. She's amazing, by the way!) and we've lost a combined 200 LBS!\n\nKeto has given me control of my life. I feel like I finally understand  what my body needs.

Now I regularly do 72-96 hour fasts and only eat 2-3 times per week because I only seem to lose weight while fasting anymore; I decided I'd rather have a few large meals than restrict my OMAD meal size any further.  I'm going to ride it out as long as the weight loss continues, but I know I don't want to do longer fasts than this, I did ONE 5-day fast and my body was REALLY unhappy afterwards.  While fasting, I drink Monster Ultra Zero, water, and some Diet Mountain Dew.  The Monster may halt autophagy but that isn't my main goal for fasting.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions.

{"title": "1.5 years of OMAD, KETO, & Resistance Training", "selftext": "33M | 6'0'' | 450lb to 190lb\n\nBefore: [https://imgur.com/baealCg](https://imgur.com/baealCg)\n\nAfter: [https://imgur.com/jtDitDz](https://imgur.com/jtDitDz)\n\nHopefully this inspires someone to start today.\n\nAsk me anything folks :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update:** Thank you for the support guys. I didn't expect the post to blow up like this lol. I will be adding some tips to my initial post to answer some questions. These are the things that worked for me and I will do my best to keep these up to date.\n\n**What I eat:** A clean keto diet focusing on whole foods and minimal ingredients. Chicken, beef, pork, eggs, tuna, fish, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, kale. I also only drink water or unsweetened almond milk. For treats I eat macadamia nuts, pecans, almonds, peanuts, brazil nuts, pili nuts. I never have these stocked in the house because I would finish them all on day one lol.\n\n**Calorie Partitioning:** I like to keep things simple. High protein, moderate fat, 0 to low carb. On some days it will be high fat, moderate protein, 0 to low carb, but the importance is to always hit your protein goal. Protein for me is filling and also the macronutrient with the highest thermic effect. Your body will burn 20% of the calories from protein by just processing them- this is free food. If you eat a high protein diet, you can get away with eating more because the net gain is ultimately lower than if you ate more fat or carbs.\n\n**OMAD:** I complete my training before my OMAD and break my fast with a lean protein shake (whey protein isolate). I then have my meal 20 minutes later and drink 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (with the mother) to end my OMAD. After so many hours of fasting, your HGH (human growth hormone) gets a giant spike. After working out, you get yet another spike to HGH. HGH is a hormone directly responsible for building/repairing muscle and a bunch of other critical body jobs. By breaking your fast with protein, you are priming your body for muscle building mode and reducing the chances of instant fat storage.\n\n**Resistance Training:** I started with [https://stronglifts.com/5x5/](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) and then gradually tweaked it as I got stronger. You can buy a power rack and perform all these workouts at home or go to a gym. The workouts are very time efficient and as a beginner your main focus should always be proper form to ensure you don't hurt yourself. I also do pushups, pullups, and a mix of workouts with dumbbells. You also need sleep to actually build muscle so if you're working out and eating like a beast, but not getting any rest, results will be suboptimal.\n\n**Autophagy & Extended Fasts:** I did 7 day water fasts every other month. Fasting triggers autophagy and it helps with tightening up loose skin, clearing up skin, and breaking plateaus but it also has tons more benefits; [https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy](https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy). Our ancestors didn't have the luxury of having food available to them the way we do and so they didn't eat frequently. A lot of the metabolic diseases we see nowadays stem from us constantly consuming and what makes it even worse is we're consuming the wrong things- a bunch of processed foods with little to no nutritional value, synthetic coloring, taste, preservatives etc. If you eat healthy AND give your body a chance to clean itself and heal, imagine what you could do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quick Facts / Tips:**\n\n**RMR & BMR:** Stands for Resting Metabolic Rate and Basal Metabolic rate. In short, this is the amount of calories that your body burns by simply existing. Things like weight, height, sex, and age are all factors. Here is a simple yet good explanation of both terms: [https://www.verywellfit.com/metabolism-facts-101-3495605](https://www.verywellfit.com/metabolism-facts-101-3495605). There is also a calculator in there if you want to deep dive it.\n\n**Calorie Math:** A gram of fat is 9 calories. A gram of protein / carb is 4 calories. If something has 10 grams of fat and 15 grams of protein, the food still consists of more fat than protein\\~ 90 calories of fat, 60 grams of protein. Be sure to pay attention to calories from fat when going on a calorie deficit as a lot of things we eat on keto are high fat; avocado oil, nuts, condiments etc. One of my go to condiments is classic mustard as it is very low calorie and minimal ingredients.\n\n**Body Recomposition:** The more weight you lose, the more diminishing returns you will see. Your body will put up a fight to get rid of the last 5-10 pounds you want to lose because it is designed to store that fat in case of famine / starvation. You will most likely need to add in resistance training and some cardio to healthily burn off those last few pounds of fat. The good news is that if you are in the body recomposition stage, your hard work has already paid off and if you keep pushing you will see those abs and cuts soon :\\].\n\n**H2O:** Drinking freezing cold water can boost your metabolism because it forces your body to use resources to warm the water to body temperature. This may seem like a small change but if you factor this in to every glass of water you drink, the gains are huge in the long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/mvm9i6/15_years_of_omad_keto_resistance_training/", "created_utc": 1619030284.0, "score": 1443, "author": "iGrizzly", "num_comments": 379, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/mvm9i6/15_years_of_omad_keto_resistance_training/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "SV and NSV: 50 pounds down on keto!", "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/lLlnjgS](https://imgur.com/a/lLlnjgS)\n\nTLDR: On my journey with keto, I am down 50 pounds and look and feel better than ever! Slow and steady wins the race.\n\nHey everyone! Longtime lurker here, and finally brave enough to post. Background info: I lost about 25 pounds my freshman year of college (2011-2012) doing the CICO method and working out, which got me down to about the weight I am now. Life happened, and I wound up gaining 50+ pounds by 2017. I started PA school in July, and saw a flier for a weight loss support group at the health center and decided to go. I knew I needed to get healthier, because how am I going to profess health to patients when clearly I don't make good choices?\n\nI went to the meeting and made an appointment with the doctor, who specializes in obesity management. He got bloodwork from me, and it turned out I was insulin resistant from all of the weight I had gained and damage I had done to my body over the previous years. For some reason, he didn't check a hemoglobin A1C so I have no idea what that was back then. I had to start metformin and I was heartbroken. One of my classmates had been doing keto so I decided to talk to her about it. It made sense: too many carbs leads to diabetes, so cutting them out would help, right? She pointed me to Reddit and other keto websites for advice, and has been a huge supporter of mine since.\n\nI committed from September to late November. Thanksgiving and Christmas made me give in and stop. I told myself I'd get back on it for the new year, but it didn't happen. I didn't want to go through the keto flu while I was trying to study. I put it off and put it off until I had gained back 13 of the pounds I had lost. During my 2nd rotation, I got on the scale and saw 176.5. That's when it finally kicked my butt into gear. I started eating keto again, and the keto flu consisted of a migraine for one evening and night, then I was over it (I def could have dealt with that earlier in the year, but oh well).\n\nI was eating keto with the occasional Zumba for Wii work out, but I wasn't really doing much else. I went from 176.5 down to 156 by Christmas. I fell off the wagon again, but this time it was only for one week. On New Year's Eve (which was on a Monday) I started Focus T25. I had done it one time before with CICO and had pretty good results from it. I committed, giving myself only my birthday to do as I pleased with what I ate. And on my birthday, I was miserable from all the carbs! I did every workout every day for 10 weeks, supplementing Zumba for Wii on my 'rest days' and adding it when I wasn't going anywhere on top of the T25 workouts. Over the course of 10 weeks, I am down another 20 pounds, giving me a grand total of 50 pounds lost on keto over the last two years! I start Gamma phase on Monday, which will be more weight training. My hemoglobin A1C in November was 4.7%, and my primary care provider (who is also a PA and one of my mentors) told me I really didn't need the metformin anymore!\n\nI just wanted to share my story and my results in the hopes that it will inspire other people who are struggling, especially for petite women. I know on the days I felt the lowest, I would look for scale and non-scale victory posts for inspiration. I am so glad I have before and after pictures, because I was really struggling mentally with the mirror and how I looked.

We brought some coffee and muffins for my wife's family who had been there since 3am, thinking they would all be hungry, but it turned out they had already eaten.\n\nWhen the doctor was in the room tending to my wife's grandfather, we offered her and her nurses/fellow doctors/staff the box of muffins and coffees, since we had no use for them and figured they could probably use them. The doctor proceeded to gratefully take the coffees but didn't want the muffins. She explained that she and most of the doctors and nurses were obsessed with the keto diet lately! Of course, this caused my wife and I to light up like Christmas trees!\n\nShe was down 25 pounds, her husband was down 35 pounds (and his type 1 diabetes was showing far better stats). She rattled off a number of other success stories from the hospital staff who were doing keto, and how much weight they'd lost and how much their medical stats had been improving.\n\nAfter she'd finished with my wife's grandfather she stayed and chatted with us for about 5 minutes about how much research everyone had been doing about it because of the stigma involved with being in the medical profession and doing keto. About how it goes against everything they were trained to advocate for when they were learning medicine, but how much they're learning now. She said she's been tracking her cholesterol levels since she started (something her fellow sceptical doctors had warned her about) and it had dropped since she's started! It was really cool to speak to someone in the medical field about it.\n\nIn fact, some of you may remember I posted a couple of days ago about the fact my wife is going through a stall right now. The doctor had all sorts of recommendations, one of which was actually to eat fewer vegetables and more fat. Never thought I'd live to see the day. Obviously it was a sucky, frantic morning because of my wife's grandfather's health, but I thought you would all appreciate, as we did, the fact there's a team of doctors and nurses finding health and weight loss in keto, and advocating for it, at least on a personal level. It certainly cheered us up and motivated us to keep going!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7382tf/had_an_interesting_chat_with_an_emergency_room/", "created_utc": 1506694706.0, "score": 1436, "author": "mangrovejackson", "num_comments": 255, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/7382tf/had_an_interesting_chat_with_an_emergency_room/", "html_title": ""}

I bought a crap scale and weighed myself at 351lbs. For that month I tried eating well, or what I thought was \"well\", but on November 1st I officially started Keto. It was a long process trying to figure out my body - I lacked on electrolytes, I ate too much fat, I tried to incorporate exercise way too quickly, and I struggled to find ways to force myself to drink water. Now I make 2 28oz and 2 32oz ketoades in different MiO flavors every day, I only eat fats as toppings or cooking oils and I took a break from my home gym until I lose a few more lbs. One meal a day is something I never though was possible either.\n\nAfter a particularly difficult evening (because of unrelated events), I found myself not wanting my OMAD last night as usual and I went to bed at 9pm. Enter several fragmented dreams about me breaking my Keto diet, eating pieces of toast and realizing in my dream only a second later that, \"hey, this is toast!!! I can't eat this!!!\" Thankfully I woke up toast-less, carb-less, and feeling glad I didn't break my 134 day streak.\n\nFor the last two weeks I've been gaining and losing the same 2 pounds and although it hasn't deterred my confidence in Keto, it has certainly been frustrating and a bit dampening on the ole mood because I have been teetering between 305-303lbs... so close from Twotopia. \n\nI woke up this morning, still in a rut about the events of last night, only to weigh myself and see 299.6lbs. \n\nI immediately burst into tears and looked at my new body, with a total of 52lbs lost since November 1st, 2017, and I am so overwhelmed with happiness that my dedication is showing and that this WOE is maintainable and not painful - it is the best thing I've ever done. Thank you Keto community, without your before and after photos to encourage me and without your sage advice I would not be on this subreddit expressing my emotions..\n\nI had lost hope. I accepted that I would be fat forever. My journey is far from over, but 50lbs in 4.5 months compared to 0lbs lost in 29 years? Folks, Keto works. Don't listen to the naysayers. Take it from people who actually have found results. YOU. CAN. DO. THIS. It's so easy once you've decided that food can no longer have a hold on you.\n\nI'm so proud of everyone in this subreddit and so proud of you out there who decide that TODAY is the DAY. Seriously, you will never, ever regret it.\n\nHere's to my next post at Onederland... :')\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nFirst of all, thank you to everyone for such kind, supportive words. What started out as a milestone for me, making this thread at 50lbs lost, became a outreach of love and empathy and I am floored at the response I've received today. Let this post be a marker in my journey for me to refer back to fondly when I'm at the end of my journey as a representation of my perseverance and how all of you were with me every step of the way. Thank you r/keto for not letting me down. Much love and support from my full heart in all of your journeys as well. KCKO!\n\n**2nd edit**\n\nFor the sake of those who get to twotopia and onederland, although I just hit 299.6 yesterday, I came back to 301 today.

{"title": "170 lbs in 1 year!!! 31M | SW 394 | CW 215 | GW 194", "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI've been obese my entire life, Heaviest at 446 and pulled off what i thought was impossible. I know there is a lot here but when you change your life you may want to share with others how you did it. You all can do it too. \n\n See Progress Pics [https://imgur.com/oqxeBX1](https://imgur.com/oqxeBX1) \n\n I was driving to work about a year ago and was brought to tears by the video below. The next day I started Keto, going to the Gym, and IF shortly thereafter. I am tracking to be at goal, 200lbs lost in 13.5 months weighing in at 194. I am doing it and you can do it too. \n\n\"Discipline Equals Freedom\"\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEv5PxrDvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEv5PxrDvs) \n\nSecondary Motivation\n\nDavid Goggins - \"Cant Hurt Me\" Audio Book on Audible. \n\n**Diet**\n\nI used an APP and tracked EVERYTHING for the first 3 months. Using Carb Manager i counted Cals and strictly adhered to Macros. Importing recipes was awesome for meal ideas. After 3 months i got the hang of it and stopped tracking which made things a lot easier. 3 meals was a lot at first. I was getting sick eating that much fat in the morning. I started eating 2 meals and more keto snacks and this worked well for the next 6 months. I meal prepped every weekend to keep on track. This is when I found Keto Ice Creams, Keto Breads Sauces and other staples to make the diet much more enjoyable. Prior it was just Meats, Veggies and fats the Last 3 months has been 1 meal per day with 2 or 3 snacks with one being a bullet proof coffee most days. The first 8 months i was still eating a good 2,000 calories a day. Now at the end I am still eating a good 1,300 to 1,500. This was a ramping down of Cals and Meals. \n\n**Exercise**\n\nI WORK MY ASS OFF AND I LOVE IT!!! 3 to 5 days a week almost every week for the last year. Barring pulled muscles or being lazy, i would say there were several times I took a week or so break but always got back at it. I've done cardio and weight lifting this whole time. Workouts average 90 mins. I started on the recumbent Bike, I moved to the elliptical and now run on the treadmill. On Each Machine I progressively ramped up the miles or worked harder HIIT/Invervals. Weights I split muscle groups, Chest, Shoulders, Arms mostly upper body for the first half. Dumbells and Machines. About 8 Months in I weight 240 and started Boxing and incorporated Compound Lifts like deadlifts and squats. I also stopped skipping leg day and started lifting heavier. This was a ramping up of work through my journey in Cardio and in Weights and Lifts. \n\n**Fasting**\n\nI started with the minimum IF window of 12 hours, then i did 14 hour fast 10 hour window, now 16/8. After 8 Months i weight about 240 and hit more walls. I've done 2 o 3 day water only fasts. Probably 4 or 5 2 day fasts. right now weight 215 and almost at goal i'll occasionally do OMAD or just skip an extra day if i'm lazy. Fasting really works well for me, my laziness actually helps here and its easy to get the energy from fats not eat and be good to go. Knowing your losing a bunch of weight. This was also a ramp. smaller fasts to begin with and increased longer fasts towards the end. \n\n**Help**\n\nI used a nutritionist for a few months. She was a great help in learning how to read labels and the ins and outs of what I was eating. I started going to the Gym with a friend from work. a Good Gym buddy is a great help. I Inspired another Friend of mine and we started Boxing together. I went to the Doctors when I started, i got a physical including EKG to make sure i wouldn't have a hard attack at almost 400lbs doing cardio.  I absolutely cant wait to go back to get my next physical a little over a year later and almost at 200. \n\n**Cheats**\n\nI've cheated 3 times where I ate carbs and sugar. My Birthday, Christmas and then one other insignificant time i cant remember. Each of these turned into 2 or 3 day \"screw its\" but It was worth it, kept me sane. I gained 10 pounds back and had big spikes. Not always easy to get right back into Ketosis. A good 3 day fast will help with this. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI feel lucky, i did this with hard work and dedication but it almost feels like magic. I DID IT WITH KETO IF AND WORKING MY ASS OFF AT THE GYM. Other than that i am a little in disbelief. Everything i did was a Ramp. I ate more in the beginning, fasted less and My workouts got better and better. I didn't want to do it all at once, what would happen if i hit a plateau? I hit small \"walls\" and each time i would change something up. I attribute this ramping and constant changing of exercise, diet and fasting to never hitting a true plateau. I weight 215 right now and nothing will stop me from 194lbs!!! from there I plan to to put this whole thing in Reverse so to speak. I do plan to get off Keto, i dont want to give up carbs forever. I plan to Carb Cycle and continue to Lift Heavy. This is more of a Body Builder diet. I want to stay under 200 and hopefully build more muscle. I plan to decrease my IF and start eating 2 or 3 meals if i want a day. Although once i incorporate Carbs I think fasting, whether IF or extended will go a long weight to keeping me under 200.\n\nI am doing it and you can too - go get some people!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/fw979b/170_lbs_in_1_year_31m_sw_394_cw_215_gw_194/", "created_utc": 1586214744.0, "score": 1412, "author": "Reddit_Mearl", "num_comments": 63, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/fw979b/170_lbs_in_1_year_31m_sw_394_cw_215_gw_194/", "html_title": ""}

Started keto on June 20, 2017 with the goal of just being less fat. I wanted to hit 220-230 punds, I wanted to move down from XXL to L in shirt size, I wanted to go from a size 44 pants to maybe a 38 or a 36 on a good day. \n\nWell, here I am, 9 months and 1 day later, weighing 207.2, wearing a medium shirt and a size 34 pants. You heard that right, folks, the shirt I'm wearing in that final pic is a fucking ***medium***. There's an episode of Sienfeld where it reveals that Jerry wears down the 4 in his size 34 pants and writes a 2 over them so he can pretend he's a size 32, so I'm also officially Jerry Sienfeld sized.\n\nALSO I HAD DIABETES AND I DON'T (officially cleared by my doctor a few weeks ago)\n\n**From then to now:** \n\nStarted with keto for about 6 months and lost a bunch of weight until I plateaued at around 60-70 pounds lost. Started IF (Intermittent Fasting for the uninitiated - my strategy was just to not eat until lunch, which is about 7-8 hours after I wake up) around January and the weight loss picked right back up again. I had no planned cheat days, just cheat bites/snacks here and there, and maybe a couple of days where I had more cheat bites than non-cheat bites, but such is life. \n\n**Future:**\n\nNow that i've hit 9 months and the excess weight is pretty much gone, it's time to finally hit the gym I guess :/. My wife's been going to the gym since before we started dieting (She's doing awesome, too, btw, but I'd rather not speak for her here). Since she gets to bring a guest for free, I went with her for the first time last night. I had a good time but pushed a little too hard for my first time and had to call it quits earlier than I wanted to. But, I'll still be going back tonight.\n\nI'll also be keeping a close eye on how it goes with both IF and working out, but I have a feeling I wont be able to maintain both for long.\n\nAnd now that I've surpassed my goal? \n\nIt didn't hit me until I weighed 217 to check my BMI progress and I'm in the 'overweight' range. The chart showed 190 pounds being at the top of my 'healthy' range, so I originally decided to make that my new goal.\n\nInstead of setting my new goal to 190, however, I have decided to put more effort into my fitness than my weight at this point. I will still be doing everything the same, but I do not want a scale obsession to get in the way of my actual health. \n\n**Future, but more future:**\n\nAs I mentioned above that I had been diabetic, I'll probably stay low-carb for life, even if 20g carbs a day starts to become too low. I'd also be curious to hear what anyone else is eating that has hit their goal and is maintaining.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/861h1y/pics_9_months_in_90_pounds_down_im_10_pounds_past/", "created_utc": 1521633316.0, "score": 1401, "author": "AxeEffect3890", "num_comments": 166, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/861h1y/pics_9_months_in_90_pounds_down_im_10_pounds_past/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One Year Later...", "selftext": "A few years ago, I hit my absolute low point. Took the fam to Universal, and wasn't allowed to board the Harry Potter ride with my children because I was too large to fit. I almost cried - I had read all the books aloud to my kids for 6 years, watched all the movies together, and this was supposed to be the ultimate finale. I had no idea how far I had let myself go until I got home and weighed myself. 299 pounds. I felt like crying again.  \n\n\nI started a diet plan immediately. Of course, in accordance with \"official\" diet recommendations, I started a low-fat regimen. Managed to lose 50 pounds on sheer willpower before I was overcome by my body screaming for nutrition. Started to rebound, and got back up to 285 pounds. Went to my doctor and asked for surgery. He told me I wasn't fat enough to qualify. I offered to put on the necessary weight in one month. He chuckled, and then saw that I was serious.   \n\n\nAs an alternative, he talked me into seeing a nutritionist. If that failed, he said, he'd consider surgery.  \n\n\nSo, off to the nutritionist I went. She's awesome - she explained to me how people my age had been fed horrible advice all our lives. As everyone here already knows, the body needs fat, and will dial up the chemical hunger signals until you give it fat. She put me on a low-carb, high protein, moderate good fats diet. Started me tracking everything on CarbManager. 20% caloric deficit.  \n\n\nI started losing weight immediately. As an avid redditor, I joined this sub and got the tips to really crank up the loss, while mitigating keto flu and other common pitfalls. I spent a summer hiking in the mountains, and working out. It was so much easier when I wasn't a total fat-ass!  \n\n\nI made it down to 197 pounds, and that's kind of my jam. I've since put on about 5 pounds, but it's muscle - I've never been this fit in my whole life. I'm doing taekwondo several times a week, going to OrangeTheory, and still hiking. I've signed up for an 8k race in two weeks.  \n\n\nI owe thanks to my wife, first of all. She and I did it together - she's got her own keto weightloss story. We keep each other accountable and motivated.  \n\n\nBut I also wanted to thank all of you lovely people in this sub. You are the best community I've ever seen here - supportive, welcoming, patient.

{"title": "Not always the diet", "selftext": "I posted here a few weeks ago about getting headaches, regardless of keeping up with my electrolytes. After trying many things, even going back to carbs for a week thinking keto was my problem, I started taking Vitamin D supplements. This definitely helped and I thought I was on the mend. The headaches were still there, but there was a marked improvement. But, after about a week, it started getting worse again.\n\nI was at my wits end. I thought that keto had screwed me up permanently. The headaches were affecting my work, and my mood. I wasn't going out because I was so drained from the pain. It was never debilitating, it was just constant. \n\nNow I'm not fond of doctors, especially after my last one was not keto friendly. I have since moved country and so was not registered here in the UK.

{"title": "8 months of keto. Face gains still amaze me the most!", "selftext": "My background is that I started \"lazy\" keto back on July 1st 2018 sitting at \\~280lbs. I say approximately because once the battery died on my scale at 280lbs in March of 2018, I didn't ever want to put a new one back in.   The battery was finally replaced a month into keto.    \n\nI initially didn't track anything but kept my carbs under 25g and starting doing basic strength training / LISS.   Even with eating way too many calories, 50lbs melted away in 4 months and my strength has increased very noticeably.    \n\nThen came an almost 1 month stall at 230lbs.  Then another stall at 215lbs for just as long.  Now I'm sitting at 205lbs wondering if I will ever hit oneder-land!!  Each time I hit these stalls, I always found motivation hitting up these forums and figured it was time to return the favor.  Especially the \"slow and steady\" posts.  As awesome as seeing all these people losing 200lbs in 4 months is, it was probably stressing me out that I wasn't doing the same.    \n\nFor those wondering how I overcame stalls, it was just doing what I already knew I had to do.  Tracking my macros diligently got me past my first stall (along with adding in KetoChow shakes for easier food prep).  IF got me past the 2nd stall along with adding in soccer league for fun on top of training.  No way I could have ever dreamed about doing soccer again with my 2 \"bad knees\".

I did a lot more research and after decided to do intermittent fasting as well as really starting to monitor what I ate instead of just freelancing it . It turned out I was over consuming keto foods, snacking quite a bit and that was stalling my weigh loss, even reversing it to a degree.\n\nSo I got myself on a more regimented program.  I generally eat a large meal around 1PM  then a small snack at 5PM. The rest of the time is a fasting window for me. This sounds hard but it actually isn't if you eat the right foods and it takes a while to get used to.\n\nAnyway this really boosted results. And I am clearly not where I want to be body-fat wise but I feel that I am really turning the corner now.  My goal is to get my body-fat to around 20% (currently 24% and my all time high was 27% in June of 2018). My weight, I am not that concerned about but I have dropped from a high of 227 to 200. I really do not want to weigh much less than 200.  I am focused more on body composition.\n\nI am 50. So my needs and metabolism are different than younger people. I think the challenges are a bit more daunting due to slower metabolism and years of yo yo dieting.  But I am healing my body and getting it all back on track.  My wife and I are on this together, and that helps. She has lost more than 25 ponds.  Maybe one day she will post.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fiEpI4p\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ao5chh/50_year_old_male_lost_25_pounds_in_25_months_from/", "created_utc": 1549556145.0, "score": 1386, "author": "None", "num_comments": 69, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/ao5chh/50_year_old_male_lost_25_pounds_in_25_months_from/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Down over 70lbs in 6.5 months with Keto and IF!", "selftext": "[Before and \u201cafter\u201d](https://imgur.com/a/IgXiIdj)\n\nI had started trying to lose weight in April of this year. At first, I tried changing my eating habits (started eating ground turkey, veggies, low fat yogurt, calories below 1000), and working out for 2 hours (1 hour cardio, 1 hour strength training) 5 days a week. I quickly became burned out, and saw little change on the scale and my measurements. \n\nOn July 12, I started keto. I did the one-week meal plan from the FAQ page on this subreddit, and I ate that for over 3 weeks. I finally felt comfortable enough to make my own meals and the weight began melting off of me. Between April 1 and July 11 I had lost 22.8 lbs, but between July 12 and October 18 I had lost 50.8lbs! I couldn\u2019t believe it. So far, I\u2019ve lost 4.5\u201d in my bust, 6\u201d(!!!!) in my waist, and 5\u201d in my hips. \n\nWith 73.6lbs gone, I\u2019m over halfway to my goal weight of 154lbs. The \u201cafter\u201d photo was taken on October 18, but I hesitate calling it a true after photo, since my journey is not yet complete. Here\u2019s to the next milestone! KCKO. \n\nEdit: here are more details on my diet/exercise when I started Keto mid-July of this year:\n\nTo start, my job keeps me fairly active (I usually get in about 6,000-10,000 steps in per shift, but most of it is sitting at a desk honestly).\n\nWeek 1: 3 meals/ day, and [this is exactly what I ate. I ate this exact menu plan for 3 weeks, but added IF after week 1. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/one_week_meal_plan/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=keto&utm_content=t5_2rske) I did *not* exercise apart from my 30-minute walk I take on my break at work each night to help me stay awake. \n\nWeek 2: first half of the week I did IF 16:8, with my eating window being 5pm-1am. Second half of the week I bumped it up to 18:6, since I could never eat past 11pm-ish anyways (not hungry. I work overnights in a hospital, and work 7p-7a, so this eating window worked perfectly for me. I still only did my 30-minute walk. \n\nWeek 3: started 20:4 IF, kept same \u201cworkout regimen,\u201d except we were moving the next ~2 weeks so I was a bit more active. \n\nWeek 4: transitioned to OMAD, as it was basically the same as 20:4 since I could never eat after my first meal at 5pm anyways. Dabbled in \u201cextended fasts\u201d which never made it past 40 hours. I don\u2019t know why, but 40-44 hours for me is the hardest time. I used the app Zero at first to track my fasts, but later transitioned to Life, as I just like that interface better. As far as a menu, I started eating foods I knew were low/zero carb instead of meal prepping. I HATE meal prepping. I don\u2019t like leftovers. First world problems. My meals consisted of any combination of steak (ribeye), eggs, bacon, ground beef, broccoli, okra, cottage cheese. I still kept under ~1300 calories, but I never counted calories really, just tried to stick to macros of 65% fat, 25-30% protein, under 15g carbs. I was usually under 9g of carbs. \n\nStarting in September, I started getting the hang of longer fasts. I only ever got an upset stomach once during refeeding periods, but I had eaten a bunch of sauerkraut, and then decided to walk around Costco. No bueno. Do not recommend. But if you\u2019re in the twin cities area of Minnesota, I highly recommend [Kramarczuk\u2019s Eastern European Deli](https://kramarczuks.com/) , they have amazing sausage and sauerkraut. Just don\u2019t break a 109hr fast with it. \n\nFast forward to now: I\u2019ve started easing back into working out with taking walks/jogs around the lake by my house or running on the treadmill at the gym if it\u2019s snowing/too cold out. I\u2019m going to start adding in weight training again, and am probably going to go back to OMAD instead of fasting, as it was hard for me to work out while fasting. Yes, I have tried snake juice, no I will not continue to do it, no matter how many times that guy in the video calls me a fatty, haha. \n\nWhat has worked best for me is to just keep things simple. I don\u2019t make crazy keto recipes, although they look amazing, because what I\u2019ve been doing is satisfying to me and works for me. If it doesn\u2019t work for you, try something out!

{"title": "Keto litterally saved my sister life yesterday!", "selftext": "I got my sister on Keto in April this year. I am in USA and she is in Canada. Even from here, I was seeing her going to bad to worst. \nShe was in such a bad shape that the doctors were just feeding her pills (19 per days) and let her in her misery. She had the by-pass surgery 1 year ago and it didn't help her at all - lost 10lbs, diabetes still really high, pancreas disease, fat liver disease, high pressure, hypothyroid and more. All diseases linked to her PCOS.  She's 59, sedentary, depressed and all the diets she tried never worked.  She was a smoker for 40 years and even did quit,  trying to help herself and get that supposedly miracle surgery.  She was freaking out since our mom died at 65 from the same conditions.  The clock was ticking in her head.\n\nMy own condition worsened and I was starting to show all the same sign as her even younger, so I was seeing my future in her and our mom.  Short story, I found Keto, changed my life for the better and begged her to give herself a chance too and try it.  And she did. She really did.  Nothing to lose, gonna die anyway attitude.\n\nShe said that we never had the same diet (I was into nutrition, health, Pyramid etc) and that my veggies didn't save me? How can bacon save us?  She had no right to eat lot of keto stuff according to her nutritionist post-surgery, that I was insane to even tell her to try.  She did anyway.\n\nAnd dang did it works. She is down to 2 pills per day (still waiting on her cholesterol level and her thyroid to drop those maybe), her blood level are healthy, no more pressure, you know, all the benefits of Keto kicking in and giving us hope for her.\n\nThis friday, out of sudden, her leg started to bloat and she had to go to the ER.  They told her she had a thrombosis and were scare that it will be in her lung. They did test on her, found out that the blood clots was stuck in her left leg and did act on it right away.\n\nIf that would have happen few weeks ago, before Keto, she wouldn't even know she had it, she was use to be bloated, not able to walk and to the pain. She wouldn't have act on it right away. She was feeling so much hell what is a bit more, right?  But with Keto, she is so active, so much healthier that she did notice.  The doctor were able to eliminate real quick the possible cause since her healthy lifestyle did made a change and no more pills side-effect to consider.  They acted quick, even one doctor told her to keep doing Keto and that even if he wasn't well educated about it, he was impressed by her results in a so short time.  \n\nShe called me from the hospital and told me I saved her life. I didn't. She did. By taking a huge leap of faith and giving up everything she knew and learned a new WOE.  Proud of her.  I have hope that she will go over her fear of 65 now.   And btw, she is down 20lbs (185lbs)!  Way to go! \n\nI can't be more grateful to this community and to the youtubers that fed me so much information, inspiration, motivation and knowledge.  Keto is doing more than helping us lose weight, it is saving our life. I'm a believer 100%.\n\nP.S.  She doesn't speak English so I have to translate/explain everything to her but I keep sending her post from here, story that you guys share, lot of you went where she was and it is incredibly helpful so keep sharing please!!!! We need it.\nP.S.2 I was really annoying her with electrolyte, potassium, magnesium, sodium etc.  She told that to her doctor.

In addition, my doctor had to increase my blood pressure medication. I was miserable. I had a toddler I could not keep up with physically and I was always, always tired. So with the new year, I decided enough was enough. I started off low carb to ease myself into the diet. I knew nothing about calories, macros, tracking, what was clean and what wasn\u2019t. I basically ate a lot of protein.  The weight started to drop but after a month, it plateaued. After tons of research, reading, following successful keto people on IG, and watching videos from keto experts, in March of 2020, I started a strict keto diet. I got my macros, and started logging in my food and made sure all my macros were met every single day. I ate very very clean and did not cheat for 6 months straight. \n\nThe hard work paid off and in 7 months, I went from a size 14 to a size 4, a size I had not been since I was 18 years old.  It was a fantasy size I never thought in a million years I would see again. (Note: I lost the weight with no exercise. It was 100% diet. Now that I\u2019m more comfortable with my body, I\u2019ve been incorporating exercise which make me feel so much better.)\n\n[Progress Photos](https://imgur.com/a/fPfcxuK)\n\n[Highest Weight vs. Lowest Weight](https://imgur.com/a/wlQE5PS)\n\n[Prom Dress Try-on 18 Years Later](https://imgur.com/a/jVOzzcO)\n\nOnce I got to my lowest weight of 127 lbs, I decided it was time for maintenance.

{"title": "One year of Keto today! Losing fat is just one of the many benefits.", "selftext": "'Tis the season for starting diets and I'm noticing an increase in disinformation and PR attempts to discredit Keto. For the most part, I've kept pretty quiet about it online. Today happens to be my 1 year anniversary of following the Keto way of eating.\n\n**45/M/5'10\" | SW: 230? | CW: 185 | GW: 165**\n\nHere's some of my experiences:\n\n\u2022 I've lost around 45 pounds so far with no exercise. I didn't weigh myself at the start, so I have to estimate. Photo: [https://i.imgur.com/TvB7Nwt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/TvB7Nwt.jpg)\n\n\u2022 Most of the information on nutrition from textbooks, associations, doctors, etc. isn't just wrong, it's doing major damage to our health. There's a reason we're collectively getting fatter and sicker and it's not that we used to be more active or that somehow our genes have become defective in one or two generations. If you have Amazon Prime, watch \"Fat: A Documentary\" and start unlearning and relearning.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Type 2 Diabetes can be put into complete remission. I hadn't been to the doctor in a while, but I have no doubt I was at least pre-diabetic, based on some symptoms I was experiencing. 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. At the current rate, that will be 1 in 3 by 2050. My HbA1c is currently 4.8.\n\n\u2022\u00a0What I used to call being hungry was actually just cravings. When you eat foods that trigger satiety, you learn the difference. When you experience satiety, the binging behaviors go away.\n\n\u2022\u00a0When your blood sugar is stable, you can go without eating. Intermittent fasting becomes really easy. Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day - that's just marketing, skip it. If you're not hungry, don't eat.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Now that I'm not inflamed all the time, I just feel better. When chronic inflammation is your reality, you don't realize that it's not normal to be achy all the time. I was experiencing random muscle and bone pain (fibromyalgia?). I would randomly feel like I had pulled a muscle in my leg one day and it would be gone the next. My arm would feel like my bone was aching. Haven't had that at all over the last 12 months.\n\n\u2022 My seasonal allergies were significantly better this year - probably again because I'm not in a perpetual state of inflammation.\n\n\u2022\u00a0My skin is better. No more boils, no more hidradenitis suppurativa.\n\n\u2022 18 months ago I was on the verge of going to the doctor to get tested for chronic fatigue syndrome. I was having episodes every two weeks where I would have this debilitating brain fog. I couldn't focus on anything, I couldn't get anything done, and I would drive to work in the morning feeling so exhausted that I would question whether or not I should really be driving. That is all gone.\n\n\u2022\u00a0My mental health has improved. My mood is much more stable, I'm less irritable.\n\nWith a list like that, it sounds like I'm selling some sort of snake oil, but it's 100% true. There's no program to subscribe to, no products to buy, no pills to take. In fact, if you see something at the grocery store with \"keto\" on the label, you'd probably be better avoiding it. All you need is real food, preferably with one ingredient. Can't go wrong with eggs, ribeye, butter, and broccoli.\n\nSeeing all of the progress posts on here all year long has definitely kept me motivated, so I felt like I should contribute my own story.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ejisdj/one_year_of_keto_today_losing_fat_is_just_one_of/", "created_utc": 1578073340.0, "score": 1363, "author": "wbaccus", "num_comments": 134, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/ejisdj/one_year_of_keto_today_losing_fat_is_just_one_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Anyway, long story short, in a few weeks I lost the motivation it took to eat extra calories on keto, and in a sense keto might be bad for a depressed person trying not to lose weight because fat is so filling that you can feel satiated on a below-ideal level of calories, and when I decide to just sleep all day and not eat anything, my stomach's not even yelling at me like it used to when I fed it with carbs. Anyway, the TLDR is that when I started feeling bones in my chest that I hadn't noticed before, I wrote it off as I'm just bad at keto, or called it \"depressed keto\" when I had a good keto breakfast and slept the rest of the day and ended up with a grand total of 800 calories. I didn't go to the doctor until I checked the scale for the first time in awhile and I was down to 116, which hadn't happened since I was a toothpick 9th grader. I guess all I'm saying is it's easy to get lost in the macros and the meals and miss something your body is trying to communicate, like hey we have cancer. I was legitimately bad at keto, (or 'keto with ice cream', as I called it, which obviously isn't keto), and the sad irony here is that if I'd actually done strict keto like in the \"Keto with Cancer\" book I'm reading, maybe I would have held this thing off that's currently running wild in my body, but I would've needed to learn life-coping skills that didn't involve eating a fuckton of ice cream. Anyway, not sure what the gist of my post is, just up late and can't sleep because I'm dying and tomorrow I find out how long they give me. I loved diving into the details of diet to the point that my doctor asked if I had an eating disorder. Just don't get such tunnel vision that you miss the signs right in front of you for something minor like terminal lung cancer.

I didn't weigh myself until I was 2 weeks into keto - at which point I got on a scale and saw 200 lbs. So my starting weight is something over 200 lbs.\n\nIn 4 months I've lost more than 32 lbs (current weight 167.5, the least I've weighed in 4 years). I also stopped biting my nails (on accident -- the urge to bite disappeared about a week into changing my eating) and started exercising ever day. I didn't set out to become a person who works out -- but I changed my eating and after a month I thought, \"Maybe I could be a person who exercises,\" so I tried a little bit, and I love it more every day.

I actually said to my boyfriend, \"It feels like spring in my head\", by which I meant that feeling of optimism and euphoria you get after a long winter when that first springtime warmth is in the air (cold climate dwellers, do you know what I mean?).\n\nI looked at the clock and was surprised to see it was noon and I wasn't hungry. I still had lots of energy, so I decided to walk into town to buy some ingredients instead of driving. I ended up walking a few miles with a heavy backpack on, still fasted. Felt great. Came home and broke the now 24 fast with a great meal of sausage, cauliflower rice, and greens saut\u00e9ed in garlic and butter. Then went out and did a full late night food shop for the week. Got home at 10pm (when I normally drag myself to sleep) and decided that I was going to first CLEAN OUT THE ENTIRE FRIDGE instead of putting the food straight in. What??!! Woke up again this morning feeling great, and saw I was down 4lbs since two days ago after not losing weight for the last 7 weeks.\n\nFolks, this just isn't like me. My whole adult life I've been sluggish, brain fogged, and prone to sedentary behavior (a nice way of saying a bit lazy). I've suffered from reactive hypoglycemia and have had to eat every 2-3 hours to avoid feeling shaky and dizzy. I could NEVER have imagined being someone who just looks at the clock and says \"Whoops, forgot to eat!\" I've heard about this mystical fat adaptation feeling and at long last- I'm living it! For those of you in the early first weeks of keto, I encourage you to stay strong and keep going! It gets so much easier!\n\nPS- I should add that the last couple of days I have also shifted my diet somewhat- I was eating a lot of cheese/dairy and erythritol (keto ice cream, I'm looking at you) and decided to cut down on that to see if I could break out of my nearly two month stall. It's working! Now that I'm used to the low carb count, I'm focusing on bringing really nutrient dense foods into my daily diet- grass fed meat, fermented veggies, dark leafy greens, etc. Will still be eating fathead pizza (SO good), but more as a weekend treat than as part of my daily diet.

So many things have changed for me. Not only my weight, but I feel more comfortable in my body than I ever have. I can tie my own shoes, I\u2019m not winded after taking only a few steps. Standing up, and getting out of bed are no longer painful, and my quality of life in general has improved. I\u2019m no longer insulin resistant. I have energy when I wake up in the morning and it\u2019s sustained throughout the day. I\u2019ve only had one migraine in the past year when they used to be a monthly occurrence. It wasn\u2019t until I began to lose weight that I realized how unhealthy I was. I had been morbidly obese from an early age, and it felt normal to me. I knew nothing else. My body was fighting to keep me alive. I owe it to myself to take care of myself. I\u2019ve made mistakes, and I\u2019ll keep making them. My progress has slowed the past few months, I\u2019ve been maintaining, but I am going to finish what I started. Keto and intermittent fasting has changed my life in so many wonderful ways. I\u2019m so proud of myself and what I\u2019ve managed to accomplish, this wasn\u2019t easy and the choices I make everyday aren\u2019t easy either. I came to realize that both the passing of my father and the sexual abuse I faced from a family member as a child and the culmination of unfortunate life events had everything to do with why I turned to food for solace. I had to face the pain and emotional trauma that I\u2019ve buried into my body, and the reasons I gained and consoled myself with food. I\u2019ll be honest it was difficult to take a long hard look at what happened to me, and the fact that what I was doing was an internalized form of self harm. I didn\u2019t deserve that, but now the healing can begin. The reason I say this is because I know there are many people who internalize pain in the same way that I did. There\u2019s so much to look forward to, you just have to keep pushing. I hope this post inspires some of you.

{"title": "Popular keto youtuber Dr. Eric Berg is a fraud", "selftext": "Recently, Eric Berg has done a [video on vitamin A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzBnjfjbjUM). The information in this video is completely plagiarized  from [Chris Kresser\u2019s Article about vitamin A](http://healthybabycode.com/why-you-cant-get-vitamin-a-from-eating-vegetables). No credit has been given to Chris Kresser. The study Berg links in his description is the only source for his video. That study however says nothing about beta-carotene conversion to retinol. It also says nothing about the genetic disposition of a bad converter. He basically copied the information from ONE article word by word and made a video about it. This is not how you do scientific research, not to mention its unethical not giving credit to the only source you use. \n\nPeople get fooled by Berg\u2019s professional appearance and blindly trust him. Just because he calls himself a doctor (which he is not) and uses a white board like a teacher does, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s credible.\nIt\u2019s apparent the guy is just trying to sell his supplements, which is ironic since in the past he has advised against taking supplements. He also has [strong ties to Scientology](https://tonyortega.org/2017/07/15/whale-watching-update-your-2017-mid-year-guide-to-whos-keeping-scientology-alive/) having donated half a million dollars to get promoted.\n\nThat being said, the article from Chris Kresser itself is filled with misinformation about vitamin A.\nThe study about the 3% conversion rate has nothing to do with the conversion from beta-carotene to retinol. It only says that when carrots are consumed raw and without additional fat source the bio-availability of beta-carotene is 3%. But when cooked and eaten with additional fat this 3% availability increases to almost 40%. \nFurther, the study where he claims 45% of adults can\u2019t convert any beta-carotene is miss-interpreted.\nThe study shows that about 45% of people just have a reduced capability of conversion. This reduced capability can range from 32% less conversion, to 69% less conversion. So to claim 45% cant convert at all is false.\nAlso, Eric Berg mentions that the recommended daily dose of vitamin A is 9000\u00b5g per day, which is completely false. The recommended daily dose is around 800 to 1000\u00b5g retinol per day. \nIn Chris Kresser\u2019s article, he calculates how much retinol you would need with a 3% conversion rate to get the same amount of retinol you would from beef liver. So Eric Berg also completely miss-understood the only source he was using. \n\nLets do a calculation if carrots actually provide enough retinol:\n\n[This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20200262/) shows that in people without the genetic disposition, the beta-carotene to retinol conversion in a carrot has a ratio of 15:1. \n100g of fat cooked carrot we get 7600\u00b5g of beta-carotene. If we apply the ratio from above, we would get 506\u00b5g of retinol from 100g carrots. So to get 800\u00b5g we would need to consume 160g of carrots per day which is less than half a pound. Far less than the 4.4 pounds stated.\nIf you have the genetic disposition to convert less, then it will become harder to meet the daily value but not impossible if you eat carrots, sweet potato, kale, honey melons and mangos daily. For convenience the easiest is of course to consume liver or retinol supplements.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/k3a40l/popular_keto_youtuber_dr_eric_berg_is_a_fraud/", "created_utc": 1606659594.0, "score": 1348, "author": "_th3truth_", "num_comments": 379, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/k3a40l/popular_keto_youtuber_dr_eric_berg_is_a_fraud/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I started keto in June of 2014 when the scale hit 255 lbs and was doing a severe version of lazy keto for about a year (trust me, it was difficult enough for me). During that year, I cut out most obvious carbs (bread, rice, pasta, sweets) but would eat breaded chicken and meatballs in tomato sauce and other similar stuff. After seeing physical results and other keto positives (mental clarity, better sleep, etc.), I started getting more and more strict about carb intake on keto. Over the course of the past 6 months, I have been on a relatively strict keto diet (most days under 30 g of carbs) and added in calorie restriction as well. I also keep my alcohol consumption at a minimum and eat out very infrequently (if I do eat out, I always choose a place with a salad).\n\nCurrently, my weight is hovering between 164 - 168 lbs and I lift 3 times a week.

{"title": "[Pics] Recovering Binge Eater, 80 Pounds Gone in Under 6 Months! Keto/Fasting!", "selftext": "[Instagram photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpL0F3vDMCh/?taken-by=ketchupkitty) and [imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/eYoffp9) (slightly NSFW) for photos instagram messed up!\n\nHey Reddit, my name is Cody and I'm a recovering binge eater.  \n\nAround 10 years ago I had an extremely traumatic experience which completely tanked my self worth and made it difficult for me to experience happiness so I turned to food.  Instead of confronting my issues and moving forward with my life I just ate food constantly to keep grasp of what is once felt like to be \"human\".  My regular eating cycle during this time was the normal 3 meals plus snacks but I'd also (generally 4-5 times a week) order a couple pizzas, subway subs or donair and poutine and devour that as well on top of everything else I was eating. \n\nSo it didn't take long for me to become morbidly obese and ruin many of the other aspects of my life.  It was tough financially because I spent so much money on food, I didn't want to be around other people so I push many friends away as well as put allot of stress on my family.  \n\nAll of this almost came to its conclusion back in December when I got [flesh eating disease](https://imgur.com/a/TSUmNVd) (images are slightly NSFW) and almost died.  My weight made the surgery very risky and I'm just lucky all I really lost was my belly button.  After being in the hospital for 10 days, I had to go in and out of the hospital 3 times a week for the next 4 and a half months while I grew everything back they took out from the debridement.  \n\nOnce I was fully healed the surgeon that did my surgery asked me on our last visit what we were going to do about my weight and if I wanted help.  I felt truely defeated about my weight but I knew I needed help so I told him yes.  Weeks later I get a letter from something called \"weight wise\" which is basically a program for people like me to prep and get ready for bariatric surgery.  This was a real wake up call for me because it made me really realize how hopeless I must have appeared to everyone.  This made me want better for myself and even if it wasn't for the weight wise programs 2 year waiting list I was determined to do something about this on my own.  \n\nSo I started keto.  I knew about it from past failed attempts at getting my eating and weight under control but I just don't think I was ready then.  I started off just by eating keto and walking more.  I did that for awhile and it wasn't long before I wasn't hungry in the morning so I just started to skip meals and it wasn't long after that I realized some days I only needed to eat once a day.  Additionally a couple months go by and I started working out 3 or 4 times a week which seemed to give me lots of energy and kept me from hitting a plateau until I of course did.   So once I started to notice the weight loss get stagnant I did more research into prolonged water fasting and decided to give that a day.  I started off by doing a couple days and eventually worked my way up to 3 and a half days without eating!  This was a very great experience for me because it helped me learn allot about my body and it made me feel good as well.   When my best friend went on vacation I decided to challenge myself and water fasted for an entire week in which I lost 15 pounds (gained back 7 within a week).  \n\nSo I'd say Keto saved me, its given me a second chance.  Its amazing how changing what I was eating not only has made me healthier but gave me control over my hunger.  I'm still messed up emotionally but this whole experience has given me the courage to reach out and get therapy for my other issues as well.   So while I still have lots of work to do I'm on the right path now. \n\nThanks for listening!\n\n\nEdit:  I wanted to thank you all so so much for all of the overwhelming support!  I sat here for the last couple hours replying to all of you completely teared up and filled with joy.  I promise to be back and update you all on some future milestones! \n\nI will try to reply to some more comments tomorrow but I'm getting ready to travel to Texas for a trip I was suppose to take in January before the flesh eating disease had different ideas.    \n\nTake care everyone.

(275 -> 225)\n\nThen I relaxed the diet but only for beer, binge drinking about 4-7 times per month. Stayed strict about solid carbs though <30/day, but I would obviously bounce out of keto after a night of drinking. My body has become accustomed to going in and out of keto, I know it's not the fastest way to lose weight with the diet but it fits my current lifestyle.\n\nI love how much more energy I have and how even hours after a meal I still don't feel hungry!\n\n**Exercise**: I play basketball about 2-3 times a month, gym once a week lol and Golf/Disc golf about 3-4 times a week. So not much weight loss oriented exercise, I'm planing to lift weights now that I hit my weight goal. I might be biased but my athleticism and flexibility has improved remarkably. I'm still a weakling in the gym though. \n\n**Mental**: At the start of the diet I wanted to change how I was living. Going to bed at 4 or 5am, easily eating up to 3000+ calories a day. Depression, Anxiety ect.. I started the diet about a month before biting the bullet and going to see a GP and talking about my issues. Got prescribed welbutrin and started seeing a therapist. Easily one of the hardest things I've ever done but also one of the best. I never thought I could feel this good about myself. Keto was the kick-start I needed to start caring about myself. \n\n\n**Other**: 1 month ago I got the first real hair cut of my life, took me about a week to build up the courage to go to a real barbershop.  But it was so worth it.\n\nI've changed out a large portion of my wardrobe, mostly because none of it fit me anymore! But also I was wearing the same stuff everyday, now I love my new clothes, shout out to /r/malefashionadvice . \n\nI also started a simple /r/SkincareAddiction routine. Using sunscreen when I know I'm going to be outdoors has made the biggest impact I think.

I was not planning to post a progress Pic until I hit my goal but seeing others do have been very motivational for me so I just wanted to show what can be achieved in a little over a month on keto and encourage those who are hesitant to start. This is 5 weeks of progress. \n\nI feel so great physically, I used to feel pain in my ribs when I cough and felt like I'm gonna explode. Now I'm breathing better and no more back pain. I'm 5'9\" if anyone is wondering.\n\n#Edit: adding some notes below that repeat in the comments/private messages\n\n- I lost 17 lbs the first 3 weeks through diet alone then started the insanity program (HIIT workouts) in week 4. Excerxice+diet lost me only 3 lbs in two weeks but I see and feel significantly different with exercice.\n\n- I was on 30% deficit before I started excerxice and I went as low as 40% on days where I didn't feel hungry/if I could. I'm not sure how much I'm losing with insanity but I started eating for 20% deficit and my guess is what I burn puts me around 40% deficit (assuming I'm burning 400-500 calories/workout). This should keep me on track to lose 2 lbs or around 1kg per week. \n\n- I eat only when I'm hungry, and have my dinners around 7pm so I'm in at least 12 hour fasted state before breakfast. Even though I set 30-40% deficit, on days where I don't feel hungry I go as low as 50%. \n\n- I've always gained/lost weight in my core only so the difference is more obvious in pics since the weight loss is localized. Also I was always bloated after eating carbs, and though I never tested I think I am gluten intolerant based on how I felt. \n\n- My goal is to lose total of 31 kgs (68 lbs) before my 31st birthday and this challenge I set is keeping me motivated and on track so far. So this is not the end goal I still have 48 lbs to go. I know some people may laugh at that but I've done it 10 years ago when I was in college (I lost 55 lbs or 25 kgs over 6 months and it wasn't even on keto just low fat low carb diet) and I know I can do it again, or since I'm older now hopefully as close to those results as possible.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/fxcc1w/what_20_lbs_look_like/", "created_utc": 1586371948.0, "score": 1332, "author": "H3-0", "num_comments": 81, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/fxcc1w/what_20_lbs_look_like/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Friendly reminder: Keto is the simplest diet in the world but just because it is simple doesn't mean it is easy.", "selftext": "What do I mean that keto is the simplest diet in the world?  All I mean is that we really only limit the consumption of one thing: sugar molecules.  Stitch them together and call them starch or have them all separate and call them sugars it doesn't matter.  You can do a carnivorous diet, a vegan diet, a pescetarian diet, a mediterranean diet, and anything else and call it keto.  You can eat food from every corner of the globe.  You can eat 5 meals a day or 2 meals a week.  It is still keto.  If you are in ketosis it is keto.\n\nWe see some amazing stories on here about people overcoming a lifelong food addiction that puts them at 400 or 500 pounds and after trying everything else discovering that keto is all they can stick to and that's really incredible.\n\nEat food, just don't eat the carbs.  Simple.\n\nBut DO NOT confuse simple with easy!\n\nHow do you quit cigarettes?  Just stop smoking.  How do you cure alcoholism?  Just stop drinking.\n\nFood, especially but not exclusively carbs, is the most abused drug in the world.  And in this context I'll draw the line between food and drug as food being something consumed to make you healthy and fuel your body while a drug being something potentially harmful consumed to give a particular effect.\n\nDon't tell me oreos are food, they are a drug.\n\nThis is where simple and easy become very different things.  For so many of us every happy moment of our life was celebrated with a great feast and every sad moment was buried under a pile of junk food.  It is a coping mechanism and frankly an effective one.  Remove binge eating and carb debauchery from your arsenal, what are you left with?  Is it nothing?  That's a hard place to be when something does go wrong.\n\nA story for you\n\nSome years ago I had gotten down to my lowest adult weight ever.  I was a healthy BMI for the first time since I was 12.  Very soon afterward a number of factors in my life collapsed leading me to a very deep depression.  Over the course of one month I gained over 30 pounds. I kept telling myself that I would start back on keto that morning but on the way home from work I'd keep finding myself at the store picking up the treats that I loved as a child.  Oreo cookies, EL Fudges, ice cream.  I drink alcohol but this was never my vice, food was and I threw away years of hard work trying to fill an emotional hole with sugar.\n\nAny of this sound familiar?\n\nIt's not an uncommon story.\n\nSo again, Keto is an extremely simple and effective diet that has brought lots of people health when nothing else seemed to work, but please don't think of it as a magic wand that fixes everything.

{"title": "Why do some doctors hate keto? I lost 115lbs on keto and my doctor roasted me.", "selftext": "I'm 20F, 5' 9\" (175cm). SW255, CW140, GW140.\n\nSo a couple of years ago my doctor suggested that I do a low-fat diet with 6-7 small 250cal meals per day, basing them on whole grains and some very lean protein with a fruit, and taking orlistat with meals that had more fat than usual. I tried that and felt awful. I was always hungry, tired, headaches, and don't get me started on the orlistat. I lost about 20lbs in 3 months, then hit a plateau and she suggested that I need to reduce my calories and exercise more. Couldn't take it anymore, went back to eating my \"maintenance\" calories and gained back the 20lbs in 3 months. I went back to her and she said \"you need to want it bad enough to do it and you clearly didn't want it bad enough\".\n\nI did my own research and tried to do keto and IF. Started the diet for a month and lost some weight, went back to her and she roasted me telling me this is incredibly dangerous to my health and it's all water weight that I'm losing.\n\nI ignored her and continued because for the first time in my life I was enjoying food, feeling good throughout the day and losing weight at the same time. Then 115lbs lighter in just over a year, went back to her for something unrelated and didn't mention the weight at all.\n\nShe looked at my records and braught up my weight, congradulated me and said it's amazing, then asked how I lost it. I said keto and IF (OMAD). She went on this rant about how even though I've lost weight I'm definitely much unhealthier now and suggested blood tests to make sure I'm not destroying my body. I agreed as blood tests couldn't hurt.\n\nSo compared to two years ago:\n\n* A1c down\n* LDL is down\n* HDL is up\n* Triglycerides down\n* ALT down\n\nShe admitted that almost everything looked better and not a single indicator looked worse, but again, told me this is just temporary and it will all catch up to me (both the weight and health) and it will get much worse in the long run. Suggested that I should eat lots of fruits and whole grains, some fat-free dairy, keep fats to less than 20% of my calories and keep my \"added sugar\" to fewer than 10 teaspoons per day. \n\nI explained how I currently eat: 2000cal per day, low-carb (about 50g of low GI/GL carbs but not from grains, only non-starchy vegetables, legumes and low fructose fruits), 90g of protein and the rest of the calories from healthy fats combined with 16:8 IF to maintain. I also eat only good quality whole foods and avoid all processed food, and I eat ZERO added sugar rather than 10 teaspoons!\n\nSo this was \"unhealthy\" according to her, and I genuinely asked why. She said because I'm restricting fruits, and avoid grains and starches which are essential for a healthy diet.\n\nI'm a little surprised by the whole experience and how unfriendly she became the moment I told her about my success with keto and IF. Do I need a new doctor? What's going on? Will other doctors be the same?

{"title": "497 days -160lbs", "selftext": "Last update https://imgur.com/a/qZlf3Wd\n\nIt's been 130 some days since my last post. I stay away from here because of how stiffling & anti free speech this sub is. But just wanted to encourage people that have followed me and others to keep going, it's really not hard at all. Find things you like and stay consistent. Everyone is different. I started and my first 6 months was a learning experience to say the least. Stayed strict 20net carbs, but it was way to restrictive for me and once i went to 30-38 net carbs it was a whole new experience, opened up a lot more variety. Not only have I lost 160+ lbs myself I have helped a half dozen others lose a combined total of 100+ lbs. It's amazing what a tracker, food scale, and good food choices can accomplish. I'm the lightest I've ever been my whole adult life, I no longer have acid reflux, I workout every day, I hit 10,000-20,000 steps daily. I am only 5lbs away from my original goal set for myself now. Misconceptions about keto is that its an automatic weight loss diet. Or you have to eat fat to lose fat. Incorrect. Sure once you start keto you drop a bunch of water weight but the real battle of Losing weight is all about calories. Eat less and burn more. Simple. Eating more fat just consumes your calories for the day quicker. Another that some people claim is that certain foods \"stall\" them. If you aren't losing weight your not properly tracking or your overeating. Can't tell you how many times I've heard people say \"my metabolism stopped\".... \ud83e\udd14 That would mean your dead... Use your food scale! If you weigh all your meals with a scale and stick with your calculated macros at a deficit you will lose weight. Want to lose more quickly eat at a bigger deficit. Eat lean protein. Your body burns more calories digesting it and it keeps you full throughout the day. Eat greens, get your fiber in. Eat things that are low fat, non fat, light, low calorie, zero calorie, zero sugar these things are where its all at. Dont compare yourself to others, focus on you, & get your electrolytes in daily. My advice is just keep it simple, stay consistent and never stop investing in yourself. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0e", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ur10sg/497_days_160lbs/", "created_utc": 1652721480.0, "score": 1146, "author": "andrewwc87", "num_comments": 115, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/ur10sg/497_days_160lbs/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Keto CURED a very NSFW male medical condition....", "selftext": "What I\u2019m about to share might sound wild, but it happened to me, and it\u2019s completely true.\n\nA few months ago, my diet was terrible - sugar, wheat, cake, fast food - just an all-around disaster. Then, one random morning, I woke up, looked down at my tool (let\u2019s call it that), and noticed a small mark on the tip. I assumed it had rubbed against my zipper or something and didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nOver the next few weeks, however, things got worse. Spots started appearing, the skin dried out, white lesions formed, and eventually, the issue spread all the way to my rear. When it became unbearable, I went to the doctor. They initially diagnosed it as balanitis (please, do yourself a favor and don\u2019t look it up) and prescribed antifungal cream, assuring me it would clear up in a week or two.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. In fact, things got *worse*.\n\nI did some research and found that fluconazole might help, so I bought some and gave it a shot. No luck. At this point, I went back to the doctor. This time, they suggested getting tested for STDs and prescribed a stronger cream. My test results came back completely clear, but the new cream still did nothing. Meanwhile, my diet remained awful, and my condition continued to deteriorate.\n\nFast forward three months. One day, I woke up with a blister\u2014yes, a huge, painful blister\u2014right on the tip. It hurt to sit, to walk, and the skin had started to crack and bleed. Things had officially hit rock bottom ( I took images from the start, I won't share them here, but honestly it's really really bad how things got, it was like a massive yellow-colored water balloon was sitting on my tool and it was fucking unbearable).\n\nI rushed to the hospital, where doctors examined me. One male doctor admitted he had never seen anything like it before\u2014except maybe in a single medical textbook decades ago. They suggested seeing a specialist, but the next available appointment was 7-10 weeks away. During the visit, the topic of blood sugar and diabetes came up. The doctor mentioned that, in some cases, diabetes might cause skin issues. But my bloodwork was normal, and I wasn\u2019t diabetic, so they left it at that.\n\nI walked out feeling frustrated but also hopeful that the specialist would have answers.\n\nThat conversation about blood sugar stuck with me, though. It made me think about my diet\u2014how much sugar, carbs, and junk I had been consuming. The next day, I decided that until my specialist appointment, I would switch to keto. I had done keto before on and off, so it wasn\u2019t new to me, but this time, I went extreme\u2014eggs, meat, some veggies, and the occasional sugar-free drink.\n\nFor the first week, nothing changed. But after about three weeks, I noticed something: less pain, fewer lesions, and my skin actually looking normal again. The white spots that had completely taken over started vanishing. Two more weeks later, the wounds healed, the spots were 95% gone, and my skin felt moisturized and healthy. Another week after that? Back to normal, aside from one or two tiny lingering spots.\n\nI was *shocked*. I had made zero other changes\u2014no creams, no new medication, nothing. Just diet.\n\nI don\u2019t know why keto worked. Was I on the path to diabetes, and my body was warning me? Did my diet somehow trigger an extreme inflammatory response? I have no idea. All I know is that keto fixed whatever was happening. Maybe it was something else I'm not aware of, but all I know is before keto I was sick, and during/after keto my sickness went away.\n\nI still plan to see the specialist, just to get their opinion, but as far as treatment goes, I don\u2019t need anything anymore. Maybe if I went back to my old diet, the issue would return\u2014but honestly, after this experience, I\u2019m not willing to find out.\n\nJust wanted to share this bizarre but eye-opening experience.\n\nTLDR: My little (but actually BIG \ud83d\ude06) johnny boy got sick in an odd way and the only thing that made him healthy was keto.\n\nUpdate: I have seen the specialist dermatologist and had my gut test done, the results of the latter are yet to come back but they believe there might be some bacterial-gut infection. The dermatologist confirmed that it was indeed a very nasty form of **Lichen Planus + Bacterial Infection** I suffered, and maybe in the first time in my life a doctor agreed with me and said the diet is likely to have helped. He mentioned that with auto-immune conditions you never know how it starts but reducing inflamation, sugar and food-irritants is extremly helpful in narrowing/resolving conditions.

I have never once been skinny.  I started keto in August, and now I weigh 179.   My self esteem is through the roof, which has helped with my depression.  I honestly think I am no longer depressed.  (My entire life I have had issues with it)  I can see a 4pack now and I know I'll hit the 6 pack soon enough.  I look great and I've never thought so before. \n\nI got here by getting rid of carbs.  I am not a good dieter.  I have a need to snack and my worst habit is my addiction to fancy coffees.  But I have made that a part of my diet.\n\nI'm not a good writer so let me just spill out a typical daily food intake. I have a half n half sugar free vanilla latte usually 2x a day. (8g carbs per latte)  I will otherwise eat bacon or chicken via the airfryer for 2 meals. (0g carbs) I snack on almonds otherwise. (Carbs but with high fiber,, 2g net carbs) I don't skip cheese, butter or avocado or any type of fat. I have eaten a pound of bacon 5 days of the average week as a meal.  One day per week I add a big dose of vegetables if I have not gotten any.  Otherwise I have often been eating at surcheros getting a chicken spinach salad with guacamole and cheeses only. That is delicious. \n\nIt's all about the carbs.  You have to read the packages and make your goal to 25g carbs or less.  Eat whatever else you want that is keto.  \n\nI initially ate more, and I have naturally become less hungry and easier to fill.  \n\nRead the packages though, avoid those carbs and sugars. (Sugars and carbs may as well be the same thing.  I avoid 100% of sugar) \n\nI take my vitamins and drink some electrolytes daily.  I have even added a little exercise to my routine. \n\nThis message is for people who have a hard time following a diet.  Dirty keto is easy.  It's not perfect keto but to my previously fat ass, it is doable.  I am writing to encourage you if you have never tried a diet before or have a hard time.  This one is doable.  \n\nYou basically teach your body that fat is a good fuel source.  Being carb free in ketosis, my body no longer is creating fat.

{"title": "100 lbs lost today!", "selftext": "This morning when I stepped on the scale I was 100 lbs down! This is such a big moment for me. When I started I said to myself, wouldn't it be amazing if I could lose 100 lbs in a year? I didn't think I could do it. It's been 10 months and here it is! Celebrate with me! 49 yo, H:5'7\", SW: 387, CW: 287\n\nMy background: I've been overweight and obese my whole life. All of my blood relatives are SMO. Both my parents had gastric bypass surgery 20 years ago with pretty serious complications. They are the only ones of my relatives to ever successfully lose weight, so I figured that was in my future if I wanted to lose weight. I have always eaten relatively healthy (or what I thought was - lower fat, higher carb) and have been pretty active (swimming, biking, walking), which is probably how I've avoided a lot of the difficulties that comes with being as big as I was. I have some food allergies that prevent me from eating junk food, though I did used to indulge in some ice cream or chocolate, though not huge amounts. I also have Thyroid issues and T2 diabetes.  I think I'm a really classic case of trying really hard but eating the wrong thing for my body.\n\nThe Catalyst: During quarantine my gym closed down and I had to stop swimming, and that really sucked. I tried other exercises, but there wasn't anything I liked as much as swimming. Then I caught COVID, and I got really, really sick. I have asthma, and it was pretty bad. And then this turned into long COVID, and suddenly I was disabled. I couldn't even walk to my mailbox. I had to be on prednisone for 5 weeks, and my previously borderline and well-controlled T2 diabetes suddenly went haywire, and my A1C shot to over 8 points! My doctor put me on some medicine that made me basically pee out sugar, so I decided something had to change. I started a diet change to change my blood sugars mainly, though of course weight loss was on my mind. I did a bunch of research on the best diet for blood sugars, and I decided to do keto.\n\nWhat I did: I started lowering my carbs in April, and went strict keto May 1. The common critique of keto is that it's hard to sustain, but to be honest I really like it. I think it's a really good fit for me. I read an article about a new diabetes medication coming out called mounjaro, and so I asked my doctor about it - and I started it in July. It's been a fantastic med for me, it's helped with weight loss and my blood sugars. And then slowly, as my COVID lungs have allowed, I've gotten back into swimming. I'm now swimming an hour every day nonstop. I chart my foods every day using chronometer, I have a spreadsheet of calories, carbs and miles swam every day, and this charting keeps me motivated.\n\nResults: I just got my bloodwork back from my doctor, and everything looks amazing. My lipids look great, my A1C is 5.3 (!!!), my fasting glucose was 94, and the only thing my doctor wants me to do is up my Vitamin D. Blood pressure is great, my doctor is super happy.\n\nSuprises along the way: I will go 2-3 weeks at the same weight and then have a week where I lose 5-10 lbs. I am the definition of non-linear weight loss. Also, I have found when I focus on the scale I get frustrated - when I focus on my blood sugars I feel successful. I was also surprised how soon I was out of my clothes - I have gone from a 30/32 (Torrid size 6) to a 20/22 (Torrid size 3). I am also surprised by how normal everything feels now - this is just how I eat and how I do things.\n\nI'm about halfway through my journey as I figure it. I don't know how long it will take, as I understand the closer to goal weight you get the slower it goes.

I'd gotten so heavy that I could no longer get up from the floor or the ground under my own power.  So fat I could no longer wipe my own ass or cut my own toenails.  I felt trapped in a mountain of fat.  A mountain that I was forced to drag around with me 24/7 where ever I went and no matter what I was doing.  I was ashamed to be seen in public and had come to avoid going out unless I absolutely had to.\n\nAfter my numerous failures at losing and keeping off the weight over the years, it seemed hopeless. It was while  in this humiliating, degrading, desolate and seemingly hopeless place that I did the one thing all addicts need to do before they can change their behavior - I hit bottom and I was ready to change.\n\nThrough a series of fortuitous circumstances, my 45 year old daughter was doing keto and she offered to help familiarize me with the do's and don'ts.  I soon learned what a keto macro was and what it meant to be calorie restricted.  We bought a kitchen scale and proceeded to build a spreadsheet of keto foods, their caloric, fat, protein and carb values.   And from that spreadsheet we began to construct super satisfying (understatement), entirely satiating meals of under twenty carbs and 1250 calories.   I built a spreadsheet menu template that automatically did the math and simplified the process of keeping within the required macro limits and I began the ritual of printing up a daily menu to help guide our weighing efforts.  We now have nearly two hundred daily menus that I can reference any time I need to.\n\nAt first it was very strange and unfamiliar to weigh and measure and evaluate every morsel that went into my mouth on the daily, but very soon we grew accustomed to the mechanic's of the  process to the point that it's now a seamless part of every day's meal plan .  My wife and 43 year old, morbidly obese, son who lives with us, devote time every day to deciding what ingredients will go into that day's menu.  My son, voluntarily joined me on the keto plan last April, weighing 385 lbs.  Here, seven months later, he weighs 273 lbs. having dropped over 100 lbs.  As his father, I couldn't be happier to see  that my son, like his dad,  is also finally escaping from his massive obesity prison.\n\nIn summation, I'd like to say that I'm well aware that this weight loss journey is not now, nor has it ever been a one way street.  Just as I have dropped 118 lbs since starting, there's only my desire to keep staying true to a food plan that's finally working that's keeping me from ballooning back up again.  My struggle with compulsive over eating, like all addictions, is a life time issue and not one that can be 'fixed' by reaching some arbitrary weight loss goal.\n\nSuffice it to say that I am overjoyed to be a normal size again.  Flabbergasted to be weighing under two hundred pounds and just reveling in the pure pleasure of having a body that I can use to live an active life with what few years I still have remaining (you should have seen how happy I was the first time I cut my own toenails in YEARS! Or when I was able to drop to the floor and rise to my feet again without the aid of a table or chair for support! OMG it really is the little things).\n\nKeto has given me back something that time, old age, physical attrition, depression and morbid obesity was absolutely denying me.\n\nNever going back to that - it's  keto forever!\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/184mxpg/im_75_years_old_and_started_keto_on_the_1st_of/", "created_utc": 1701037846.0, "score": 848, "author": "SnakebyteXX", "num_comments": 54, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/184mxpg/im_75_years_old_and_started_keto_on_the_1st_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "My dad has S4 Pancreatic Cancer & is doing keto", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I am back to update. \nI\u2019ve been hesitant to post an update because my last post was very triggering for me and I don\u2019t feel I was able to handle the attention with grace for myself and others. \n\nBefore I go into the update on how my dad is currently doing, I want to clarify a few of the facts of our story that were not clear in my last post. So this is going to be a very long post because I\u2019m going to try to add a much details so I can limit unnecessary intervention. \n\nMy dad was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer mid October 2024 after he admitted himself to the hospital complaining of severe pain in his side. They found the cancer in his pancreas that spread to his liver. He was given 6 months to get his affairs in order. \n\n At this time, I lived several states away from him and haven\u2019t seen him in months. When I did see him last, I noticed a decline in his overall appearance and suspected poor health but it all seemed linked to him losing his wife (my stepmom) a year prior. \n\nSeveral days after he was diagnosed, he reached out to me and my husband asking for our help. \n\nMy husband and I have been on the keto diet for a few years to address our own individual health concerns which has worked remarkably for us both. My husband studies nutrition day and night. He\u2019s read almost every report available and has put in countless hours of research. My dad knew this about him and has had many conversations with him in the past. \n\nWhen my dad was diagnosed, he said that he was flooded with advice of all kinds from all respected peers but it became too much. My dad chose my husband. We did not go to my dad even after diagnosis with any health advice. It simply isn\u2019t our style to meddle with anyone\u2019s life choices. We always stayed in our own lane and it worked for us. \n\nMy dad wanted our help though. He asked for my husband\u2019s input and asked him about what he suggests to fight his cancer. My husband said that a body that produces ketones for energy instead of glucose will aid in fighting the cancer. But this only works with the aid of chemotherapy. Cancer cannot use ketones but cancer can use glucose. My dad wanted to try the keto diet. \n\nAfter almost a couple weeks after his diagnosis, I drove 12 hours to visit my dad with my husband, son, sister, & niece. When I arrived, my dad was in a very poor state. He was in a lot of pain. He had already lost over 80lbs, very weak, could barely walk or even get out of bed. He wasn\u2019t able to swallow food very well and had no appetite. He was surrounded by friends but they were all lost on how to help him and especially per his demands for the keto diet, everyone was lost on how to feed him. But he was barely able to even drink water when I arrived. During this time, I did process the fact that I am going to be losing my dad as a younger age than most. The grief and fear I experienced was immense. It changed me as a person. \n\nThis was a gut wrenching period for me. I felt as if I had come too late and would never see my dad as himself ever again. His decline was so quick. My husband and I immediately got to work creating at least keto shakes that were 1,000 calories with all essential nutrients included. He was able to swallow them. I taught his house guests how to prepare yogurt bowls and wrote some recipes down for them to try to prepare. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to leave after a week of being there to address my own personal health concerns back home. This was right before his first chemotherapy appointment. But his house was very full of house guests which included on of his brothers who was flying in the next day. I was going to return in a week. I was also making plans to move my family in with him as soon as possible to take care of him and cook for him for as long as he needed me too. \n\nHis first chemotherapy appointment was absolutely terrible. He was so nauseas and I heard from everyone how scary it was. The moment he felt a little better, they all pushed whatever they could get him to eat disregarding any diet. Understandably so. \n\nI returned again after I week and asked him if he wanted to continue eating whatever he wants or to return to his original plan. Even if he wanted to just eat whatever he wanted, I was going to plead that he allowed me to make it homemade and not buy anything from restaurants or stores. Before I could say much he looked me dead in the eyes, quivering, with tears rolling down his face pleading to me to help him control his diet and save him from himself. I have never seen my dad this way in my life. He was a military man who was usually very stoic and would not show any emotions. I understood what he was asking me. He said to ignore everyone else, that they all wanted to see him \u201chappy\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean he should be eating giant bowls of sugar or processed foods. \n\nI began cooking. I had already many years of practice cooking many low carb versions/keto of my favorite foods from chicken nuggets, pizzas, cakes, etc. I knew already which snacks were safe at the store and more. Although I intended to circle back to the keto diet, my dad\u2019s doctor had strongly recommended against it. I said ok. I decided to keep everything at least sugar free and lower carb as possible. \n\nMy dad went through another chemo session which was better and more smooth than his first. I had to get back home after his second chemo to begin making plans to move my family over to his house but I was going to return for Thanksgiving. \n\nI came back for Thanksgiving and stayed for his 3rd chemo session before returning home for the final time to get my affairs in order before getting settled in with my dad. \n\nAround this time it really began to eat at me. Why did his doctor strongly advise against keto? I wanted to know. So while I was home with my husband, I asked my dad to video call us into his next visit with his doctor. My husband and his doctor had a long conversation about her concerns with keto which were all related to the guidelines the health system must follow and that there weren\u2019t any solid control trial released yet to the public. She did however say that whatever I was doing was showing physical improvements since his diagnosis and that she didn\u2019t feel we should change anything in how we were cooking for him. \n\nAfter this appointment, my dad sent me a very heartfelt text message saying that he decided himself that he wants to give the keto diet another try and that he wants my help to stick with it and that he will use his army training to be more disciplined. While he was waiting for us to arrive after packing our things, he was going to eat whatever before putting it all behind him once we return. Which he did. And he got very sick that week again he said. \n\nWe came back for final time in mid December to help aid my dad in his fight against cancer. He wanted me to cook for him and wanted my husband to help with his workouts and nutritional advice. \n\nMy dad\u2019s next scan was February 3rd. He was going to be dedicated to a keto diet and exercise regime until then. He said that if his scans show that his cancer was getting worse that he was going to \u201cYOLO\u201d his way out and eat only bagels and pizza the rest of his days. \n\nFrom mid December to February 3rd, we did exactly as he asked. I did my very best to keep him in ketosis. I say I did my best because simultaneously I had to teach him what that even means so nothing was perfect.  \n\nDuring this period, we saw dramatic changes in my dad. The color in his skin went from pale back to pink. He gained weight again and has been stabilized at 183lbs which is in the normal range for his height. He was able to finally move around and drive again. He never once complained of pain anymore. He regained a lot of his independence back. His hiccups and burping subsided to barely ever when it use to be all day long when I first arrived. In October, I thought I would never see my dad as himself again and here I was experiencing him be more himself again. He even said that he has felt this good in over 10 years even having cancer now. \n\nFriends that stayed with him in the beginning of this had returned to visit him saying he looked amazing. Many of them in tears as they were living in fear of losing him very soon when they saw him last, just as I was. \n\nOn February 3rd he did his PET scan. A week after, we had a visit with his doctor to go over the results. \n\nThe results were that the tumors in his liver were in remission and they saw around 90% improvements. The pancreas was unchanged. There was a small new hot spot on top of one of kidneys. This may indicate that the cancer is trying to spread there. We get a new scan in about a couple weeks to see what is going on a discuss how to further treatment. \n\nSo overall the news was good and my dad decided to keep going to the fight he chose and asked us to continue helping him. Which we will. \n\nThe details that I\u2019ve left out in this story is all the emotional details of everything I\u2019ve had gone through and had to process along the way. So before anyone decides to comment please keep in mind that you do not know me. I do not owe you anything. You don\u2019t need anything from me. My dad doesn\u2019t need anything from you. I will no longer respond to inconsiderate comments of how I should and only should be processing his inevitable death. My dad chose this and we are in a place in life to help him live his life through how he sees it. I am not forcing keto on him. I am not controlling him. He has free will to change whatever he wants and if right now he says I\u2019m ordering a pizza, the only thing I\u2019ll say is \u201cMay I make a homemade one with love instead?\u201d And I\u2019ll fill it with carbs and love if that is what he truly desires. And it will be the best pizza I ever make. \n\n\nEdit: he\u2019s also taking Ivermectin, fenbendazole, & Apricot.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1izpdyn/my_dad_has_s4_pancreatic_cancer_is_doing_keto/", "created_utc": 1740687549.0, "score": 826, "author": "CharmingSpecific3110", "num_comments": 180, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1izpdyn/my_dad_has_s4_pancreatic_cancer_is_doing_keto/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

(rounded to the nearest pound).\n\n  \nIn case you are curious here is some data/info for you guys:\n\n\n\nI started my current streak Feb 6th of this year on keto, I wasn't actually in ketosis for about 3 weeks.  I ramped my carb intake down from about 150 grams per day to 100 grams/day then 50 grams/day, then finally 25 grams/day. By the end of March I was below 25 grams/day and in ketosis. This current streak I started at 312 lbs.  \n\n\n\nSince I ramped over a few weeks/Month into keto, I didnt really experience keto flu.  I want to say it took about 3 months to become fully fat adapted once in ketosis. I say this because at around May/June time-frame, I noticed some hard to explain changes in how I felt and my body; only way to describe is when I ate, I felt exactly the way I did pre-keto after eating; the feeling of hunger/fullness. Before that, I would never really feel quite satisfied from eating and would get wild spikes in energy levels (sometimes I would get really drowsy/tired/week). \n\n\n\nThe hardest part of managing the diet for me was salt intake. I am EXTREMELY sensitive to salt and if I eat too much (5000 mg/day recommended) I would get excruciatingly bad headaches which I would need to drink lots and lots of water to make go away. If I ate too little salt (less than 2000 mg/day) I would feel extremely weak/fatigued. \n\n  \nNow for some data...

She is sticking to it and so dedicated, she looks better, feels better, sleep has improved (she\u2019s getting up at 4am again and she was sleeping in and still being tired), no more depression, has more energy (even doing yard work again) and I can tell she has almost no issue with word recall now. So she went to the doctor for her memory test this week and the doctor was shocked\u2026 the tests showed her memory has improved! The dr. said she has never seen a memory improve with this disease before they almost always get worse. So that is encouraging and a step in the right direction. Now it\u2019s not back to normal yet but this is so encouraging. So far it\u2019s been a few months she\u2019s been on it\u2026 I don\u2019t remember how long somewhere between 4-6 I think. So far the only setback was a bad week where she felt bad after having her teeth worked on at the dentist under sedatives. Now she isn\u2019t back to normal totally but the difference is like night and day, before she couldn\u2019t remember how to cook and now she cooks every day no problem. Now when you talk to her you wouldn\u2019t know she has it where before it was obvious. Still a little short term memory loss, but this too is improving. Also no autoimmune flair ups yet either. All in all thank you all so much for your kind words on the last post and my family is so grateful for this diet. My grandfather is so happy he knows it\u2019s helping because he sees her every day.

It came up as a 2 and was marked \"abnormal,\" with normal being a zero.\n\nI'm a Type 2 diabetic, and most \"traditional\" allopathic medical doctors would see that number and tell me to get my ass to the ER right away cause I'm in ketoacidosis and in danger of dying.\n\nDoctor does the usual checks.  We have a conversation about how large my prostate is and then he says \"Let me check your results.\" He looks at them and then looks at me and says \"I assume you're doing a ketogenic diet because of your Type 2 diabetes?\" I said \"Yep!\", and he said \"Good for you!\" and we moved on with the appointment, with both of us having a full understanding of why the ketones are there.\n\nI love it when doctors get it!\n\nAnd, I've proven I'm in ketosis.\n\nSo my primary care doctor and my urologist is on-board with keto. Hopefully I'll never need to see an endocrinologist.

{"title": "How to make a keto diet sustainable over the long-term: a guide", "selftext": "Let's say you've muscled through the sugar cravings and have figured out your macros and are solidly losing weight (or meeting therapeutic keto goals). Great! Unfortunately, weight loss can take a long long time, years sometimes, and if you're doing keto therapeutically it's a lifetime commitment. This guide aims to make keto significantly easier so it isn't something you have to maintain willpower in for months or years.\n\n**1. Electrolytes**\n\nElectrolytes are the difference between feeling like crap (or like you're dying) and not. Getting adequate amounts of them from food (or supplements) is essential, and not just during the induction period to prevent keto flu -- the lower insulin will mess with your sodium levels on a continuous basis.\n\nThat said, the amounts needed are highly individual and will probably go down over time as your body adapts. You may need less or more than what's recommended in the guide:\n\n* 5000mg sodium -- sodium, not salt. Table salt is 39% sodium. Sodium is the most important electrolyte and the quickest deficiency to make you feel like crap, and has effects on other electrolyte levels as well. Symptoms of a deficiency include lightheadedness, fatigue, and ironically, dehydration. Good sources include salted snacks, pickles, parmesan cheese, broth, salad dressings and basically anything processed whatsoever.\n\n* Potassium -- 1000mg as a supplement, ~4700mg as a baseline value. Signs of a potassium deficiency include having a fast heart rate for no reason, heart palpitations, anxiety, and high blood pressure (though granted that's less common on keto). A balanced keto diet should offer a lot of potassium, but good sources beyond that include avocado, beef, nuts/seeds, edamame, tomato paste/sauce, and on the supplement end, various \"hydration drinks\" offer ~700mg per bottle without adding carbs, and there's also lite salt (50/50 potassium/sodium) and nu salt/cream of tartar (100% potassium). Note that both caffeine and nicotine will deplete potassium levels, and also that obnoxiously cold weather and stress can also deplete it, so adjust your habits accordingly during those periods of time.\n\n* Magnesium -- 300mg per day. A lack of magnesium will normally manifest as constipation -- the painful difficulty-going kind, not the lessened frequency kind. It can also cause insomnia and muscle cramps. Good sources include nuts/seeds, dark chocolate and leafy vegetables. You can also supplement it -- avoid magnesium oxide, and aim for anything ending in -ate (citrate, glycinate for example).\n\n* Calcium -- while this doesn't go down with a keto diet, it's a good thing to have in your diet if you have a tendency towards oxalate kidney stones. With a high calcium intake (from food like dairy or sardines, not supplements), oxalates will bind to calcium in your intestines rather than your kidneys. Ketogenic diets can be pretty high in oxalates, so having calcium sources with them will help a lot. \n\n**2. Deliciousness**\n\nOkay, you no longer feel like crap, but now the restrictive nature of keto is catching up to you. You feel like you can't maintain this forever, or you're bored with the diet, and frustratingly the main advice you get for that is \"food is for fuel, not pleasure\". Great news, it can totally be for both.\n\nIf you do it right, a keto diet will be the most delicious diet you've ever been on. Keto-friendly foods are very flavorful, you have a lot of leeway with fat, and you're also cutting out the bland/filler parts of recipes (the starch). \n\n* Variety is key. Change up your protein sources, fat sources and vegetables if you're bored of whatever you're eating. If you really enjoy it though, by all means continue.\n\n* Overlooked fat sources include avocado, nut butters, salad dressings/mayonnaise, sour cream, cream cheese (and other cheeses). These can add a lot to a meal and because you're keto you have a lot of leeway around fat intake.\n\n* Flavorful vegetables add a lot -- olives, pickles and other fermented vegetables add both flavor and sodium, green onions and Roma tomatoes add a lot of flavor for less carbs than other onions/tomatoes, arugula and watercress taste *completely* different from spinach/lettuce, red cabbage is both sweet and low in sugar, and peppers (particularly colored) add a lot of flavor.\n\n* Butter adds a lot of flavor and doesn't add as many calories as you'd expect for what you get from it. Whenever I cook, I cook stuff in butter which adds a heck of a lot of flavor.\n\n* Soy sauce, lite soy sauce and seaweed add a lot of umami (a rich taste) with negligible carbs. They also add sodium (the soy sauces add a significant amount, seaweed less so). Additionally, lite soy sauce made with hydrolyzed vegetable protein will add quite a bit of potassium.\n\n* Spices are your friend. Get a bunch of them and learn to use them. Many *many* recipes are dictated by their spice blend alone, for example rye bread only tastes that way because of caraway seeds. Oregano/basil/garlic powder magically creates Italian food, cumin/cilantro magically creates Mexican food, ginger/hot pepper magically creates Chinese food. Dill and paprika add a hell of a lot of flavor and don't overwhelm your palate with higher quantities the way other spices do.\n\nDo a lot of experimentation and mix and match with different foods for optimal results, and constantly improve your recipes and you'll be making foods that taste *significantly better* than anything you can buy in no time. When you don't want fast food because it doesn't taste that great compared to keto food, you know you've won the battle. \n\n**3. Convenience**\n\nOkay, your food tastes great but it takes forever to cook and when you come home from work you don't want to then spend hours slaving in the kitchen. That bag of chips looks extra tempting, or your SO and kids are eating pizza they ordered, or you just want to stop at a fast food joint after work. Sure, keto tastes great but it's way too time consuming, right?\n\nWell, fortunately that isn't necessarily true either.\n\n* Meal prep is a big one. Sure you can cook one steak per meal, but you could also smoke/grill a bunch of them for later use. Hardboiled eggs keep very well if you wait to shell them and you can cook a ton of them at once. Chop up meat you've cooked in bulk, freeze it and you have easy access to protein for a long stretch.\n\n* Precooked meats are also a good option -- frozen precooked shrimp, precooked chicken breast, precooked beef are very helpful for weeks you don't want to cook or bulk cook. Also canned meats, particularly fish which is high in nutrition.\n\n* Cheese, tofu and protein burgers require zero prep as protein sources. Melt cheese in a microwave after a couple minutes if you're feeling fancy.\n\n* Vegetables can be eaten raw, and offer more soluble fiber that way. Don't do this with beans -- they're toxic raw. Granted you're probably not eating beans on a keto diet.\n\n* For days that even the ~5 minute prep time of precooked meat/salads/etc is too much, have snacks and very easy meals on hand. My go-to here are low-carb precooked sausages -- very easy to get protein and fat without work. Add some raw vegetables (or not) and I'm good to go. \n\n**4. Pizza and burgers**\n\nSometimes you just want a good burger or a few slices of pizza. Nothing wrong with that. Thankfully, there are ways of getting those on a keto diet.\n\n* Bunless burgers, *including* fast food burgers, give you what you want there without the carbs.\n\n* I'm a big fan of crustless pizza. Low-carb marinara sauce, lots of cheese (ideally mozzarella), pepperoni, 2:1 ratio of oregano to basil, plus garlic powder and (if you're feeling fancy), chopped green bell peppers, white onions and black olives perfectly replicate the taste of pizza if not improve upon it. If you need the crust, look into fathead dough or cauliflower/meat crusts. A good crustless pizza is also very convenient -- ~5mins of prep time if you're not feeling fancy around toppings, microwave for 2 minutes and you're good to go.\n\n**5. Alcohol**\n\nYes, you can have alcohol on keto. While beer is high in carbs, seltzers are zero carb, as are straight liquor/spirits. Red/dry wines are also surprisingly low in carbs. \n\nNote that keto drunks will feel significantly different from high-carb drunks. You'll likely be more of a lightweight, and you'll probably get more of an energy boost as well because the same mitochondrial buildup in your brain that's been running on ketones will use alcohol more efficiently. \n\n**6. Nutrition**\n\nDespite popular belief, keto diets can be well-balanced nutritionally. In fact, if formulated right they'll be the *most* high-nutrition diet you'll ever eat. Why? Well:\n\n* Vegetables have the same nutrient profiles as fruit, but higher quantities. They're also lower in carbs.\n\n* Seeds have the same nutrient profiles as whole grains, but *much much* higher quantities. They're also lower in carbs.\n\n* Nuts have the same nutrient profiles as legumes, but higher quantities. They're also lower in carbs.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n* Meat, eggs, cheese and fish provide gigantic amounts of varied micronutrients, and on a typical keto diet you're eating a lot more of them so are reaping more nutritional benefits.\n\n* The lowest-carb vegetables on keto (dark leafy greens) are also the most nutrient-dense.\n\n* The lowest-carb botanical fruit on keto (green bell peppers, cucumber, zucchini, yellow squash) also pack the most vitamin C. \n\n* Nuts and seeds offer a *crazy* amount of nutrient density, but are generally recommended to consume in moderation because of their fat (and sometimes sodium) content. On keto you have a lot  more leeway with fat so you can fully reap the benefits here. \n\n* Same deal with cheese -- it's not just a great source of calcium, it also offers significant amounts of vitamin A, B12, selenium and phosphorus, and since you have more leeway on fat (and hard cheeses are great protein sources), you can get a lot more.\n\n* Liver is high in all kinds of stuff, so high that if you eat too much of it you risk vitamin toxicity. Again, liver isn't generally recommended on standard diets because of the high fat content, but on keto this isn't an issue.\n\nAfter an excessive amount of research (and access to a modified USDA food database), my conclusion is that a balanced keto diet focuses on the following categories (and easily blows through the RDAs on everything):\n\n* Meat -- for B vitamins and minerals.\n\n* Leaves -- for vitamin K. Dark leafy greens offer other things as well but don't seem to be essential if you're getting them elsewhere.\n\n* Dairy -- offers calcium, selenium, B12, vitamin A, phosphorus\n\n* Nuts/seeds -- offer potassium, vitamin B1, magnesium, vitamin E, a bunch of other minerals\n\n* Botanical fruits -- offer vitamin C and phytonutrients if you care about that sort of thing.\n\n* Eggs/fish -- offer vitamin D, choline, various other nutrients (bony fish offers calcium on par with dairy, and fatty fish has a good Omega-3 content, though granted a high-fat diet is a high-omega-3 diet in general). \n\nI've been eating keto for almost 9 years, and so long as I stick to eating foods in all of those categories I'm healthy, feel great, have zero cravings for anything, etc. Otherwise problems will start to appear slowly. \n\nNow granted there are other ways of formulating balanced nutrition -- /r/zerocarb and /r/veganketo are both things that exist. This is just the bare minimum of what works best for me if I'm eating a very limited diet. It may be helpful for you as well over the long term if you find yourself lacking somewhere.\n\n**7. Sweets**\n\nOver months or years on a very low-carb diet, you're going to want sweets for a variety of reasons. Maybe someone brings donuts to work, or you see cookies in the store or whatever and this makes you sad. There are a variety of strategies for this:\n\n* Sugar-free candy or drinks that use erythritol, stevia, aspartame, allulose or monk fruit. None of these have an effect on blood sugar/ketosis (unlike other sugar alcohols) and still provide a sweet taste, allowing you to find subs when the sugar desires hit. Note that erythritol can sometimes cause gastric distress.\n\n* Almond flour + butter makes an excellent crust for keto dessert recipes. My mom made a keto key lime pie once that did this (and used erythritol) and tasted better than the real thing.\n\n* Low-carb ice cream is a thing. As are low-carb cookies. \n\n* Dark chocolate offers literal sugar but it's in such a low amount that you can easily fit it into your macros. After a while on a keto diet, your sensitivity to sugar will change and darker chocolates will taste way less bitter.\n\n* Zero soda (like coke zero) tastes indistinguishable from the real thing. There's still diet soda as well if you're old school.\n\n* There's a heck of a lot of variety in drinks that have artificial sweetener and no actual sugar. This wasn't the case seven years ago. Lots of options there if you want something sweet or are bored of water.\n\n**8. Your WALLET**\n\nKeto can be expensive. Meat is really expensive generally, and keto-friendly processed foods are way up there. If you're struggling financially at any point, you can nonetheless still do keto.\n\nProtein is going to be the main limiter with budget -- both fat sources and vegetables are cheap. I did an exhaustive study on keto-friendly protein sources, ranking them by \"cents per protein gram\", and these were the winners:\n\n* Eggs, bought in bulk\n\n* Hard cheeses in bulk. White cheeses offer less calories so are more valuable as a protein source.\n\n* Peanuts. Natural peanut butter is unfortunately more expensive, and you'd really want to go that route so it's a better protein source and doesn't have added sugar.\n\n* Chicken breast, bought in bulk. Chicken breast is very protein-dense and chicken is generally the cheapest protein, so add those factors together and the protein cost is almost on par with eggs/cheese/peanuts.\n\n* Bulk pork -- pork is the cheapest as far as red meat goes. Pork will sometimes be under chicken as well, but never chicken breast with my cents/protein metric. I didn't look at specific types of pork because I didn't eat cuts of pork at the time.\n\nCanned fish is surprisingly expensive by this metric. I think the difference there is that you're not actually getting a lot of protein per can, and the thinking around it is that it's a great protein source despite the fact that I need two or three full cans to hit my normal protein intake in a meal.\n\nCheese is actually a cheaper protein source than protein powder. The last time I measured it (last year), even bulk amounts of protein powder ended up being roughly twice as expensive. During the pandemic when the value of eggs shot way up, cheese actually topped the list.\n\nNote that my calculations here were made prior to the pandemic, when prices shot up across the board. I need to do a new study at some point, but the general rules (vegetarian protein, chicken breast in bulk) still seem to hold.\n\nBeyond vegetables, fat and fresh vegetables are dirt cheap. If you're buying nut butter or something, not so much, but if you're reliant on mayonnaise or salad dressing then it's much cheaper. \n\nNuts/seeds tend to be expensive, but there are exceptions -- sunflower seeds and pepitas are at the bottom cost-wise, as well as peanuts obviously. \n\nSpecialty flours are way up there -- almond flour, coconut flour, etc. It's cheaper to buy your own almonds and grind them, and then you get the fats from them as well. \n\nObviously, keto-friendly processed foods are expensive. Lily's chocolate can be as high as 5$, keto breads are 6$ or over, keto-friendly cookies, quest bars, shakes or snacks are way up there. As far as dark chocolate goes, the most cost-effective seems to be semisweet baking chips. Beyond that it's probably best to just avoid processed keto foods and specialty keto foods if you're on a budget.\n\n**9. Your sanity: changing your perspective and breaking cycles**\n\nSo you've followed the guide and have a well-formulated keto diet that will keep you satisfied for the months and years to come. Then your SO brings home ice cream and it's your favorite flavor and you can't help but eat a bowl of it and oh no now you've ruined all your progress and have to start over at day 1 and probably gained weight and you just suck at everything so you might as well go on a longer binge to-------STOP.\n\nThis kind of thinking is the actual problem, not the actual bowl of ice cream or whatever. Realistically, one serving of carbs isn't going to do a damn thing -- it takes a hell of a lot of calories to gain weight, and even ketosis itself will turn back on after ((net carbs)/6)+2 hours. The only way you reset your progress is if you use a slip-up as an excuse to break keto for a longer stretch, and that's easy to do if you feel like a failure.\n\nThankfully, your success is measured by what you do over the long term, not how strict you are for how long. The lifestyle is important, not the diet. As long as you maintain a general keto lifestyle, the time you start it is where you start counting the months or years, and anything you do outside of it is part of the keto learning process. With this kind of attitude, over time you'll find yourself cheating less and less frequently, eating less during them, and maybe ideally not even remembering any specific incident because they really aren't important.\n\nIf you've been keto for long enough, even *months* of a higher-carb diet can be reframed as unusual periods during your keto journey rather than \"I stopped keto, then I started again\". I had a period of time during covid where I went off the rails, but that's like six months in the middle of a 9 year stretch, so even that doesn't really matter.\n\nYour perspective is everything here -- that more than anything else dictates whether cheat meals become cheat weeks or cheat months. Ideally, you don't even use the word \"cheat\", but instead frame things as \"I eat a strict keto diet but occasionally go off it\". It's more normal than you'd think, and even if it isn't, it genuinely doesn't matter. You're making this choice for the long term so only your long term choices matter.\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n\nHopefully I've bored you to sleep. Please downvote accordingly. I have no conclusion and this is my thesis statement.

{"title": "60 lbs gone in 6 months.  But the other benefits?  Mind. Blown.", "selftext": "I entered 12-step recovery in early July for compulsive overeating.  When I entered into recovery I already knew I wanted to follow a ketogenic diet, not only for weight loss but for the health of my entire body.  But, I just couldn't seem to stick to it consistently for any length of time.  I knew I needed more than an eating plan, I needed to figure out \\*why\\* I was turning to food to soothe me.  Before recovery I tried to do keto, and I'd do well for a few days or even a week or two, and then it was back in the carbs.  This cycle kept continuing until I got blessed abstinence from these behaviors with 12-step work.\n\nWell, little did I know how that cycling in and out of ketosis was not doing me ANY favors.  I never got truly fat-adapted.  I never saw the benefits of long-term ketosis.\n\nSince July 4, by the grace of God, I have gone from 315 lbs to 255, 60 pounds of fear and protection released from my body in a little over six months.  BUT, the \\*additional\\* benefits of ketosis have been incredibly eye-opening:\n\n\\- The \"food noise\" in my head is GONE.  No longer constantly hungry.  Have even done 24-, 36- and 72-hour spiritual fasts every month or two and felt great, with electrolyte supplementation.\n\n\\- My type 2 rosacea flared badly in the first 2-3 months and I was concerned.  After that it has cleared COMPLETELY.  My body must have been clearing out all the stored gunk causing it.  My skin looks flawless!\n\n\\- My mild upper back/shoulder pain has completely disappeared.\n\n\\- My knee osteoarthritis pain is nil (this was gone within the first week, not because I lost a bunch of weight, though that helps).\n\n\\- My plantar fasciitis pain?  Bye-bye.\n\n\\- My keratosis pilaris (little bumps on my arms) is gone.\n\n\\- My energy level is through the roof!\n\n\\- My mental health is better than it has ever been in my adult life (I saw the benefits in this area instantly).\n\n\\- My IIH (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) is, for all intents and purposes, \"in remission\".\n\n\\- Had some hair loss the first couple of months but since then (and with the added help of daily Minoxodil usage) has gotten only thicker and stronger.  Telegen effluvium is a real thing - don't get too discouraged if your hair falls out a bit at the start of transition to keto.  It will grow back!\n\n\\- My intermittent weird stools/diarrhea/stomach issues are no longer.\n\n  \nI could probably go on and on and on.  While I may have originally started keto for compulsive overeating treatment and weight loss (btw, F, 47, 5'3\" - still a good 100+ lbs to go), for me this has changed my life in so many other drastic ways that I intend to eat this way forever.  Even if the \\*only\\* benefit is the suppression of the constant \"food noise\" in my head it'd be so worth it.\n\nI stick to 20-25 \\*total\\* carbs per day.  This means I steer clear of most \"keto-fied\" foods that are bulked with fiber to lower the net carbs.  I track food with Cronometer religiously.\n\nThe last couple of weight stalls I had were 2-3 weeks long each and broken with a day of carb-loading (200+ carbs) followed by return to strict keto the following day (better even yet fasting then returning to keto).  I think my body sometimes needs a \"shock\".\n\nBut in six months I've had just 3 separate days of that intentional carb-loading, and while I appreciate that it helps me break the stall, the annoying side effects (hello again, back pain!  knee pain!  rosacea!  plantar fasciitis!) of just one day of carb-loading proves to me how much my body was systematically suffering under my carb-addicted standard American diet.\n\nAll of this is to just give encouragement to anyone out there struggling to stay on keto or struggling with an eating disorder like me.  Keto WORKS, but if you're struggling to stay out of the carbs and feel powerless over the compulsion to eat, 12-step recovery is a wonderful way to work on what's really behind the food.  Overeaters Anonymous has online and in-person meetings (or join me over at Catholic in Recovery - online meetings every day!).\n\nJust don't be like me, thinking you're \"doing keto\" all the while cycling in and out of ketosis.  Three days on, three days off is not keto.  A week here, a week there is not keto.

This is not a diet plan,  there is no time limit.  Are you breathing better ? Can you walk longer distances ? Do you feel more alert ? Are you less bloated ? Are you more mindful in your eating habits? Does food taste better? This is what you need to focus on , the key to success is not the measurements or rigid carb count . It's learning to enjoy life and the freedom from constant thoughts about food . Keto and fasting will help you to do that. In order for that to happen y'all gotta chill out , tomorrow is a new day . Print out a list of keto foods and eat those items . If you're extra hungry eat a bit more . Within time,  fasting will put you right back . My body can tolerate a higher carb count than in the begining ( 70+ ). Keto gave me time with my family, smiles , I rediscovered my love for skating , I learned what food really tastes like , I can buy clothes without crying , I can run across the parking lot when it's raining , I no longer have high blood pressure.

{"title": "I'm 75 years old and have been morbidly obese about 90% of the past 35 years. I'm here to share my insight that my morbid obesity is a prison of my own making and what it's been like for me to be a habitual food offender, who's escaped from fat prison once more and never, ever wants to go back.", "selftext": "Two things helped trigger this insight.  \n\nThe first was reading a response  to a post in this forum after an OP declared that they had just managed to lose 40 lbs on keto.  The responder asked: \"How much money would you take to carry a forty pound weight around with you 24/7?\"  The answer, of course, was basically no amount of money would be worth it.  Yet, those of us who have gained huge amounts of weight and lost it over and over again, know that while we likely wouldn't do it for money?  We'd do it to ourselves, (and have done it to ourselves) one bite full at a time and for free.   We know this because we HAVE done it and done it more than once.\n\nThe second  piece of the puzzle came to me because, even after losing all that weight over these past six months, I am able to clearly remember how I felt back in March while the weight was still very much a part of me.  Frankly, I felt trapped and depressed and I was nearly convinced that I was destined to keep failing at any further weight loss efforts.  While choosing to switch to eating keto has resulted in incredible results, I know me, I'm the guy who's eaten himself fat again time after time. No matter how much progress I made losing the excess weight.  \n\nThat's when it dawned on me that morbid obesity really is a prison of the worst kind.  It's a horror story because those of us who suffer from the problem have built up a fat prison that resides inside of us. Built it one fat brick at a time. Over these past several months, on keto, just as I'm the guy who built it, I've been tearing it down - one brick, or partial brick, at a time.  Six months in, I'm now simply 'overweight', having successfully managed to remove a 100 pound ball and chain from inside my body.\n\nSo, what's different about 'this time'?  Well for one, I'm REALLY OLD now and have literally run out of time to keep putting my body through massive weight loss/weight gain yo-yo charades.  My life is on the line now (what's left of it) and I know it.  But, perhaps my deepest understanding now is that my most important task  is not to reach some arbitrary weight loss number. \n\nAs a recidivist, career fat gaining criminal, who has been in and out of my self-built, fat prison umpteen times over the past forty years?  My primary goal now, while it may sound simple, could well  be the most challenging of all.  I intend to get out and stay out of fat prison forever and always.  In line with that, my main objective going forward,  is to avoid regaining ANY of the massive weight I've lost so far\n\n\\*Many, many thanks to the authors of all the morbidly obese keto success stories I've read here over the past six month.  Even more thanks to those of you who have shared your stories about doing the harder thing, losing all that weight and keeping it off.

And I literally feel like Im constantly in the honeymoon phase of a new relationship except Im single. I have way more energy, and because I feel good, I dont drink as much.

I\u2019ve been measuring my progress by noticing my clothes becoming oversized. I went from a size 14 to a size 10. From an XL and shirts to a medium. When I started my keto journey, I was at 193 LBS. today I got on the scale and it says I am now 154 LBS! I lost almost 40 pounds in just over three months of being in keto! I\u2019m a 31-year-old female and I am 5\u20196 almost 5\u20197. I cannot believe how fast that weight came off me!\n\nIn addition to keto, I did do intermittent fast 16:8 and I started utilizing my Planet Fitness membership that I was already paying for. I didn\u2019t measure macros or count calories though I did estimate. So I did lazy keto. And I wasn\u2019t perfect either, from September 23 to now, I had 6 days that I did not stick to keto (holiday social events) but I made sure the very next day i brushed off the carb dust and was right back at it! I will say, in addition to weight loss, I am noticing improvement in my mental health as well as my moods. I also have plenty of energy throughout the day, I\u2019m sleeping well at night, and I\u2019m waking up refreshed in the morning. My athletic ability in the gym is improving more and more as well. I\u2019ll tell you, when I first started this diet, I had only intended on doing it for a couple of weeks , but seeing how it has improved my eating habits by eating home-cooked whole food meals and just how my quality of life has improved. I\u2019m sticking it out a little while longer. I think my Goal weight is going to be 135, after I get to 135. I\u2019ll just switch to maintenance. If any of you are on the fence about doing keto, do yourself a favor, start your year off, doing something real nice for yourself and just DO IT! \n\nEDIT:\nWow I did not expect this to blow up like it did! Thanks sooo much to all of you!Regarding the scale situation, I find that not watching the scale really helped me not obsessed over my weight. Because I\u2019m sure there were weeks. I probably didn\u2019t lose much weight, and then there were weeks. I probably lost a ton. I know that if I would\u2019ve weighed myself during the week where I probably didn\u2019t lose much, I probably would\u2019ve gotten discouraged. Not watching the scale helped me focus on the fact that I\u2019m developing healthy, eating habits and a healthy lifestyle, instead of obsessing over the weight number on the scale.\n\n\nA lot of you ask what I typically eat. I eat a lot of slow cooker soups and chilis. Just throw the ingredients in the slow cooker and BAM. I also will meal prep sides for days I feel like cooking a protein. Example: meal prep cauliflower, mac & cheese, cheesy spinach, and cucumber salad. Last night I bought a salmon fillet, cooked it, and ate it with a side of cheese spinach. Other days I would make lettuce, wrapped bacon, cheeseburgers, or air fryer, chicken, wings, tossed, and Frank\u2019s buffalo sauce. And I\u2019ll add one of the following sides to make a complete dinner. I recently started incorporating keto chow and it\u2019s delicious, really scratches that sweet tooth while providing our daily vitamins. I do sometimes eat homemade keto desserts. A few days ago I made keto doughnuts \ud83d\ude0b.

I started back up in March 2025 and have not eaten outside of the diet so far and I feel better.\n\nHowever, I am feeling a bit lost as I am not making progress like I did or want to. I am also probably being unrealistic.

I know this is just a way to track here and there but I feel like the amount of progress I have made this should have improved.\n\n- I can't tell if intermittent fasting is doing anything good or bad other then puting me on a schedule to eat and not eat (which I guess is the basic things for IF) I always did 16:8.

And I walk with dogs.\n\nMy highest weight was 280lb back in 2019. I got down to 208lb then and then my ex ruined that and I gained back a lot (however my clothes mostly still fit). So April 2024 I was at 278lb and starring in March 2025 I weighed 250lb. And last week I was 240lb and this week I am 245lb (mind you I started my period this week so that may affect the random weight gain as I fluctuate 5lbs that time of the month).\n\nI keep my net carbs under 20 and rarely hit 20 on a normal day. I make it a point to eat less processed stuff and majority of the things I eat are what I made from scratch.

{"title": "Trying to eliminate harmful foods from my diet with a continuous blood glucose monitor.", "selftext": "Hi guys, I've been using a blood glucose monitor to analyze the foods I am eating to watch for what is  spiking my blood sugar unexpectedly. I was intermittent fasting until I got this monitor but have begun to test certain foods by themselves, give myself a 2 hour window to allow for the spike, and then try another food. What I'm wondering is what amount of spike should I be concerned with? Ideally no spikes would be ideal and many foods don't seem to spike me at all but if I eat any products with carbs, I do see my blood sugar rise. I don't see many in the keto community talking about monitoring blood sugar like this or what levels are of concern but I do see many talking about intermittent fasting & keeping blood sugar spikes to a minimum so I'm guessing that many just don't bother to test this way. \n\nHas anybody been using a continuous glucose monitor to test & what level of glucose spike do you find unacceptable? I've already determined that me and my best friend have very different spikes even when we eat the same exact thing. I seem to be very sensitive to carbs and he is not so much. \n\nSo last night I ate some Caprese salad (mozzarella, tomatoes, balsamic vinaigrette, olive oil & basil) and saw a 30mg spike. I'm thinking this is too much. I don't eat this a lot & it's well under 20 carbs but the spike makes me think I should I be avoiding this in the future. \n\nAnother concerning food was ham. 1 carb per 3ounce serving (it says on the package). I noticed a spike when I ate it with an omelet the other day so I decided to try one serving on it's own this morning and it spiked my blood sugar about 25mg. \n\nAre these small spikes nothing to worry about or should I be trying to eliminate foods that spike me at all from my diet completely?

It was recommended to my parents and I when I was 230 lbs due to insulin resistance at age 14. \nI began my lifestyle change at the beginning of that school year, so August and by May I was 150 lbs. I have been able to keep it off with few bouts of fluctuations but this time is different. \nIn August 2024, I had my first gallbladder attack and had to begin eating a low fat to keep the attacks at bay until I could have it removed, which took running around til November with the American healthcare system to be able to do so. Normally, My comfortable weight is 150-155lbs, as a 5\u20195 woman. However, I weighed in at my one month post-op appointment in December 2024 at 195 lbs. I decided I was going to let myself have Christmas, then I would be going back onto this lifestyle. \nDecember 28th, 2024 is when I began this journey again. I log EVERYTHING in the Lose it app. A typical day for me is 2 pieces of Keto bread from Aldi, toasted with a tablespoon of almond butter and 3 pieces of back and 2 boiled eggs for breakfast. For lunch I do a turkey sandwich with Aldi Keto bread, dressed with mayo and mustard, with a turkey Chomps stick, almonds, and black olives. For dinner, I wish up between Steak with broccoli, Crack Chicken, Chicken with Queso and Cauliflower rice, or I make Keto pancakes with Almond flour and Allulose. (Would also like to say I have lost weight with Aldi\u2019s Keto bread previously) \nI have had ONE treat meal this whole time, which was for my partner and I\u2019s anniversary back in February. My weight loss: 15 lbs. \nI was truly hoping to be somewhat close to my goal weight of 150 lbs again at this point and I\u2019m getting very discouraged. I do work an office job, I burn about 400 calories a day and I try to stay in a calorie deficit using the TDEE calculator. I have not had this slow of weight loss with Keto before and I am feeling frustrated. Lastly, I am 5 days into a journey of quitting nicotine. So, other than adding more chewing gum and sugar free mints into my diet, I do my best to stay away from them. No sugar free candy, protein bars, or ice creams in my diet.

I topped out at 483 (maybe a bit more), started this journey at 482 and am now at 249. Still want to drop another 91 to a goal weight of 158. Also, zero exercise (until 5 days ago).\n\nIt was easy to keep going because my progress was dramatic:\n\nWeigh ins:\n\n4/28/2024: 482\n\n5/31/2024: 439\n\n6/29/2024: 416\n\n7/31/2024: 394\n\n9/1/2024: 368\n\n9/30/2024: 348\n\n10/31/2024: 328\n\n12/4/2024: 310\n\n1/1/2025: 294\n\n2/1/2025: 285\n\n3/3/2025: 269\n\n4/3/2025: 259\n\n5/1/2025: 249\n\nI've done Keto in the past but struggled to maintain it.  This time, I found the key for me: sugar (and sugar substitutes).  Aspartame, \"sugar alcohols,\" all that stuff, I had always thought was keeping me on track, but instead it was just keeping the struggle and temptations going.\n\nI was very tired of \"starting my diet\" only to fail at 4pm, so I did something very drastic I only did once before: A water fast.  I was careful to keep taking electrolytes to do it safely.  I was able to make it to 15 days.  I did this because I wanted a reset, something I couldn't screw up and figured I couldn't eat the wrong thing if I just didn't eat.\n\nFor me, this fast broke my cravings.  I slowly reintroduced foods and never went back to anything sweet at all, the sweetest thing I've had in the last 366 days is a macadamia nut.  I can go to holiday meals with family, see all the delicious food and it doesn't tempt me at all.  I can talk about all the things I used to crave and it doesn't even move the needle.  I honestly think sugar had been the trouble all along, too many \"cheater foods\" like the Atkins treats and such. Occasionally I will still skip a random day or two if I'm busy, just to show myself I'm still in control.\n\nAn analogy I came up with: It feels as if the cravings, the food noise, was a big bear. I could wrestle it for awhile and hold it down for a bit, but eventually it would win.  The fast put that bear into hibernation and now I only have to fend off the occasional townspeople that come looking for it.  Much simpler.\n\nMy meals are pretty simple. I will grill 2 NY strip steaks, eat one sometimes with a can of green beans or cooked broccoli (with avocado oil & sea salt), sometimes just the steak.  Then I'll put the other one in the fridge and warm it in the air fryer the next day.  Then I'll do 2 days of chicken, same thing.  Sometimes I'll throw in a fish/shrimp day. Very simple.  Almost always grilled, even through the snowy winter.  I usually eat mid-afternoon. All of my food comes from Aldi or Costco.  Even with the steaks, it's cheaper than how I was eating before. I can eat for 2 days with less than $10 with chicken from Aldi. I am also taking a multi-vitamin and a few others vitamins, etc.\n\nThe biggest struggle for me has been the mixed nuts.  I found a bag of raw mixed nuts at Aldi I like quite a bit and will get into them with some cheese and before I know it, I went through a lot of them, as a consequence, it's slowed my weight loss.  I did get a shot glass for portion control but that hasn't been working.  I need to cut these out or drastically scale back.\n\nAll of this had been WITHOUT dedicated exercise.  According to my watch, I only averaged 4,302 steps per day in the last 12 months.  This has been because my hips really bother me.  I was hoping this would fix itself with weight loss and time, but it's still there.\n\nThe last 5 days, I've started walking, the first 2 days were 1.5 miles each and the last 3 days have been 2 miles each.  It's not a ton, but I want to keep my step count over 10k going forward.\n\nThe biggest downside has been a bit of low energy and tiredness, but honestly these walks have REALLY made me feel a lot better, so I am going to keep doing it, no matter what.  Today it was raining...still...2 miles.\n\nNow I want to get under 200 pounds by October so I need to start moving to get the monthly loss higher, I know I can do it. Just got to keep moving!\n\nI just wanted to share.  I had been just recently selling all of my old clothes as I had a lot of nice dress shirts. Obviously the people that showed up were the size I was and was very shocking to me to see this as it really showed how far I've come.  Until about 3 months ago, I did not really realize how much weight I had lost until I started noticing that I fit into things like movie theater seats and freaking cars much better.  It's really been an eye opener.\n\nI will NEVER go back.

{"title": "Benefits of Allulose", "selftext": "After having GI issues with artificial sweeteners, I found Allulose to be the best all around choice for me. Here are some of the reasons.\n\nAllulose and GLP-1:\nAllulose has been found to stimulate the release of GLP-1, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes feelings of fullness. This stimulation of GLP-1 can lead to improved glucose tolerance and reduced weight gain. \nMechanism of GLP-1 release:\nAllulose's effect on GLP-1 release may be related to its ability to cause intestinal distension, which can trigger the release of GLP-1. This mechanism may involve vagal afferent nerves, which are connected to the brain and can influence appetite and food intake. \nPotential benefits:\nThe increase in GLP-1 caused by allulose is associated with several potential benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, reduced body weight gain, and enhanced glucose tolerance. \nClinical implications:\nThe findings suggest that allulose may be a valuable tool for managing blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss, potentially offering an alternative to traditional sweeteners or even medications that mimic GLP-1. \nResearch ongoing:\nWhile research has shown promising results, further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which allulose stimulates GLP-1 release and its long-term effects on various aspects of metabolic health. \n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11207032/#:~:text=Our%20results%20showed%20that%20allulose%20mitigated%20the,body%20weight%20gain%20and%20improved%20insulin%20resistance.&text=GLP%2D1%2C%20a%20hormone%20involved%20in%20glucose%20regulation,glucose%20tolerance%20and%20reducing%20weight%20gain%20[9%2C22].\n\nBlood Sugar Management:\nAllulose does not significantly impact blood glucose or insulin levels, making it a good option for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. It may also help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. \nWeight Loss:\nAllulose is low in calories and does not contribute to weight gain or fat storage. Some studies suggest it may help increase fat loss, including visceral fat. \nLiver Health:\nAllulose may help reduce fat accumulation in the liver, potentially lowering the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It may also help reduce inflammation in the liver. \nOral Hygiene:\nAllulose doesn't contribute to tooth decay, promoting oral health and reducing the risk of cavities. \nKeto-Friendly:\nAllulose is a suitable sweetener for individuals following keto or low-carb diets as it doesn't negatively impact blood sugar levels. \nGluten-Free:\nAllulose is naturally gluten-free.\nPotential Anti-Inflammatory Effects:\nSome research suggests allulose may have anti-inflammatory properties, potentially by regulating certain inflammatory pathways. \nOther Potential Benefits:\nAllulose may also help reduce oxidative stress, improve liver health, and promote satiety (feeling of fullness). \nImportant Considerations:\nModeration:\nWhile allulose is generally considered safe, it's recommended to consume it in moderation, as high doses may cause digestive discomfort. \nMore Research Needed:\nWhile promising, more long-term studies are needed to fully understand all the potential benefits and risks of allulose. \nNot an Artificial Sweetener:\nAllulose is a rare sugar that naturally occurs in some fruits and is not classified as an artificial sweetener.

{"title": "Celebrating My First Month on Keto \u2013 Results and more", "selftext": "\nHey, everyone! I wanted to share my experience and results after committing to the keto diet and a healthier lifestyle for the entire month of April. It's just the beginning of my journey to a healthier body and a more joyful life, but it's such a great start!\n\n For some context, I\u2019m a woman in my 30s. I started at 92 kg on April 1st, and as of today, I\u2019m at 87 kg! That\u2019s a 5 kg drop, and I\u2019m feeling amazing, even though I heard people lose more.\n\nI also measured some parts of my body and I could see that I lost some centimetres here and there. It's visible without the measuring tape but I enjoy tracking it!\n\nBut the changes aren\u2019t just physical, I\u2019ve noticed some serious improvements in how I feel mentally and emotionally, too.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did to stay on track:\n\nI focused purely on staying keto without counting calories (I plan to start that in May). I really listened to my body and made sure not to overeat.\n\nI didn\u2019t cheat, but I made sure my food was delicious. I really made the effort to enjoy every meal. I'm a gpod cook, so that's lucky!\n\nEven when eating out, I stuck to keto-friendly options, like a Caesar salad without croutons or a burger without the bun. I also took some pistachios with me as an emergency snack \ud83d\ude05\n\nI kept a mindful food journal, focusing on how I felt about what I ate and how much I ate\u2014this helped me stay present and aware of my choices.\n\nI walked at least 45 minutes every day and stayed active by dancing, swimming, and generally finding any excuse to move (as long as it wasn\u2019t painful!).\n\nI aimed for 7-8 hours of sleep a night, and when I didn\u2019t get enough, I\u2019d take a nap if I could.\n\n\nThe changes I\u2019ve noticed:\n\n1. My mood is so much more stable, I feel calmer, and it\u2019s way easier to find joy in little things. As someone with a history of anxiety, this has been a huge improvement.\n\n\n2. PMS is much better, I used to deal with mood swings, bloating, and pain for 5-10 days before my period, but this month, I barely noticed any of those symptoms! The only mild pain I felt was on the day of my period, which is actually today (TMI, haha).\n\n\n3. Hair loss : So, I\u2019ve been losing hair like crazy every time I wash it for the past year. I used to have thick, curly, and big hair (which I love). It\u2019s still curly and big, but I could definitely see how much I was shedding each time I washed it. Honestly, people probably wouldn\u2019t notice, but I could tell. However, just two days ago, I washed my hair and was seriously shocked\u2014it was like a miracle! I only lost about 25% of the usual amount that I used to shed. It\u2019s a small win, but for me, it\u2019s a big deal. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s keto, the extra protein, or just sheer luck, but I\u2019m hoping this side effect stays.\n\n\n4. Overall, I feel strong, beautiful, and stable\u2014like my body and mind are finally working together in harmony.\n\n\n\nI know it\u2019s not all about the numbers, but I\u2019m celebrating the mental and physical changes I\u2019ve experienced. And, of course, I want to reward myself for this month of hard work, so I\u2019ve been thinking about treating myself to one of the following:\n\n1. An air fryer (I know, I\u2019m a millennial without one\u2014what\u2019s wrong with me?)\n\n\n2. Massage treatments\n\n\n3. A new Nintendo Switch (I\u2019ve been really wanting to play more games!)\n\n\nBut I\u2019d love to hear any other ideas or what you\u2019ve done to reward yourself. Let me know what you think!\n\n\nMuch love to you all\u2014remember to love and accept yourself, and always make taking care of your health your top priority, not impressing others. \ud83d\udc95\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kc7a8z/celebrating_my_first_month_on_keto_results_and/", "created_utc": 1746101833.0, "score": 56, "author": "DreamyBi-ch", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1kc7a8z/celebrating_my_first_month_on_keto_results_and/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sugar addiction? How to cope with insane cravings?", "selftext": "I did keto / paleo for years. I lost a lot of weight once on it, and after I just stayed on it, not necessarily too strict but I just felt a lot better when eating mostly meats and fish and veggies. \n\nLast year I was in a really rough place, which meant I wasn't able to eat anymore. At one point, since I was feeling very horrible it was decided that any calories were better than none. So every night around midnight if I wasn't able to eat all day, I would just eat some high-caloric things like carrot cake to make up for at least some calories I burned and I switched to sodas during the day for some energy. I wasn't drinking sodas before. \n\nMy hunger has returned and I was able to stop medication that made me gain a lot of weight. During the carrot cake diet period I already lost 39 lbs / 18 kg, but I still have weight to lose. \n\nI'm having trouble sleeping, feel restless and unable to concentrate. I also have ADHD, the meds suppress thirst a lot which causes me to drink around one litre a day instead of the 4,5 I should be drinking. \n\nI wanted to get back onto keto to lose the excess weight. For three weeks now I have been going in and out of ketosis since the cravings get insane. I never experienced this. I'm craving sweet things so much, even after I'm in ketosis. Before it was relatively easy, but now, it's like something took possession of me, and I made the mistake of purchasing keto bars which sometimes lead me to eat five in a row. Also downing soda zero like it's nobody's business. \n\nI think it's fair to say I got addicted to sugar in that carrot cake and soda period. ADHD has always caused impulsivity issues for me, which doesn't help, and it's also making it difficult I feel like to get grip of the situation and get organized enough to handle what's coming. \n\nI have trouble drinking water, but I'm doing the best I can with electrolytes in water which also adds some taste. \n\nAnd the sugar cravings gets so bad I just don't care about losing weight for my health at that moment. I spiral during a couple of days, until reality hits me and I try again, determined to get into ketosis and repeat. \n\nI feel like a loser lacking willpower, and I am really not sure how to do this. If anybody has been in the same position and has any advice for me, please share. \n\nI'm embarrassed to admit I even smoked weed a couple of times to deal with the nerves of being jittery from wanting sugar, which then caused the munchies and caused me to eat all the keto bars or all the black berries I have lying around. I can try to go for walks etc, but I would just be walking around all night, not getting tired and still end up doing the same thing. \n\nI'm eager to break this cycle and take control of my health. It's been a shitty couple of years and with things finally looking up, I was hopeful to taking charge of my health and live a life worth living again. So I feel like a loser that now when my health issues have finally subsided and received proper treatment, the part of my healing journey which is really up to me is not happening due to lack of willpower it seems. I do really wanna do this, but I really feel like I'm lacking something to help me cope. \n\nI hope someone has some advice to offer as this cycle is making me feel the opposite of what I was going for. \n\nPlease no tough love or hate or shaming, as I am already feeling enough like a loser and am very embarrassed.

As long as you\u2019re burning fat, your body will be subjected to a constant dose of extra ketones in the blood, a condition referred to as ketosis. Ketones are, in the contempo- rary argot, toxic waste, and the prospect of subjecting yourself to a long-term dose of them is off-putting to anybody contemplating a diet.\n\nBut the alternative, not losing weight, is much less healthy. With a little knowledge and a simple trick, ketones can be conquered. First, while ketones are toxic, they\u2019re only slightly so. Dieting won\u2019t make you see huge hairy bats (unless, of course, you saw huge hairy bats before). Second, the waste products of burning fat aren\u2019t insidious\u2014they don\u2019t accumulate in the body like heavy metals or some organic toxins. Instead, they get swept out of the bloodstream by the kidneys and liver and are excreted in fairly short order.

I take it as a sign to take more mag when sodium exacerbates palpitations. Taking calcium for balance, just in case. As soon as it's in, i can feel my muscles stiffen and my vision sort of lose it's clarity.\nThere are times when I take a little potassium and go, ah I needed this! But additional supplementation usually sends me to the bathroom v quickly and leaves me with aching muscles, so, actually, it was Mag...\n\nFor background knowledge, been almost constantly dieting for 9yrs(not too strict, watching calorie intake & working out regularly), started supplementing electrolytes only around 3 years ago, when I started keto. \n\nStarted keto in the first place for what I now suspect to be symptoms of Mg deficiency(brain fog, no energy). Wanted to be in a normal, happy, energetic state of mind and body so badly. But **even though I supplemented the RDA of Mg, then later 600mg, then later even 1000mg occasionally, my condition simply continued to deteriorate.** \n\nThere wasn't even one pinpoint symptom I could talk about. I felt negative about life, then felt almost nothing at all. I had barely enough energy to exercise, though I have a good amount of muscle I've built up throughout the years. \n\nThough I wondered if the years of dieting were taking their toll on me(looked through so many posts on diet fatigue) I'd never starved myself, and took care to eat nutritious, reasonable calories. Tried eating a bit over maintenance and that did nothing to help my stamina or brain fog.\n\nThe last part sort of gave me a clue-with the speed with which my condition fluctuated, almost hourly, if not daily, if it wasn't calories, perhaps it was electrolytes-and I landed with the only thing that's made a dent in my ailing(?), excessive magnesium. \n\nI'm currently about 3 weeks into this high a dosage, of course a very short time, but I'm continuing to see improvements and little side effects. Honestly hoping very much that there will be a saturation point somewhere in the future, that I'll be able to flatten out with a more reasonable daily dosage.\n\nThe moment I really felt I was onto something was when I felt certain points on my tongue tingling, as if electrified, then a little later, the sense of taste I hadn't even known had gone returned. Then, a few days later, I could smell the subway, as I hadn't for god knows how many years-and it really stank. Also can still feel facial muscles relaxing when the Mg hits, my eyelids sliding all the way over my eyes. -Actually, to make an unending list of symptoms short, feels like **the reversing of peripheral neuropathy, or even neuropathy in general**? All sorts of senses and emotions-yes, I can finally enjoy past favorites with full blown emotions!-and memories waking up as if the nervous system is revving back to life. **This return to action is very short lived, however, if I don't keep up the torrent of Mg powder/pills/sprays**, and foggy darkness descends over my mind and body once more.\n\nThough I'm happy I've finally stumbled onto something that looks like a genuine answer, **still I'm troubled, mostly about the copious amount** I need. I'm well aware that this could take a toll on my kidneys, especially in the long term-though as I said, I'm hoping this is only a temporary requirement-and that other minerals can get tanked by the excessive Mg. Wondered now and then if there is some other ailment underlying what seems to be just a huge Mg deficiency, but then I get full body checkups every year, the results saying I'm healthy overall-so I'm just going to take that it indeed is a huge Mg deficiency. \n\nWould really put my mind more at ease, though, to know that there **are others who experienced something similar to what I'm going through**.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kasoo3/anybody_else_need_an_insane_amount_of_magnesium/", "created_utc": 1745945275.0, "score": 36, "author": "moy3931", "num_comments": 68, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1kasoo3/anybody_else_need_an_insane_amount_of_magnesium/", "html_title": ""}

The last time, I came off the diet due mainly to struggling to meal prep and plan around shift work, but I\u2019m now in a position where I need to start controlling my weight and fitness before things get out of control.\n\nI started back up again yesterday, using Thomas Delauer as a guide. Dug up my old blood ketone measuring kit and have just got a reading back of 0.8 mmol/l - from what I understand this is fairly good considering it\u2019s only been a day, and I should be aiming for somewhere between 1-3 for the best effects of nutritional ketosis.\n\nThe primary reason for me going back to it is weight loss - I\u2019m aiming to lose about 40lbs of fat, hopefully while building some muscle, but I understand that doing both will probably stall me a little. I\u2019m working with an emphasis on a cut so to speak, aiming for about 1500cal/day with the following macros:\n\n60% fats\n30% protein\nUp to 50g net carbs daily (I know this seems high, it\u2019s just where my own body seems to respond well as a threshold from memory)\n\nI\u2019m 26M, 5\u20198\u201d and currently weigh 180lbs.\n\nWould anyone be kind enough to share some tips and tricks for balancing keto meals around shift work?

Is there anything that you would change about the macros, or suggest to keep myself as healthy as possible and avoid things like the keto flu?

Adhd, depression, etc.. \n\nI jumped into a 48hr fast 2 and ended it yesterday. I read about keto diet during the journey, but didnt take it seriously. I looked up what foods to eat to break my fast. Long story short is ate a chicken salad and avocado. I felt really good after, but i assumed it because of the dopamine rush from not eating for 2 days. Anyways, few hrs later i ate bunch of grapes and a banana and felt really irritated and anxious not knowing why.\n\nAnyways today, i wok up and ate eggs and a tomato without toast (which ive never done). I felt fine then got realllyyy tired. Realizing i didnt drink water all day. I put Himalayan salt for electrolytes and 20mins later, i felt soooo good and energized, in a way i havent since i was a kid. Without caffeine or sugar. I was astounded. I didnt get my hopes up too high, but i feel so clear headed and present. Its so weird.\n\n4hrs later i ate my chicken salad again and drank more electrolytes and still i feel amazing. Idk, im literally crying right now cuz this is soo good this is all ive ever wanted for so long.\n\nMy question is, is this because of keto? Im reading it has tremendous benefits for all ailments in the body. And will this be my new normal if i continue this way. Its such a small change but so powerful i wanna cry all day in joy.\n\nUPDATE: \nSo after an hour i started feeling brainfoggy and tired and i guess i may have been high. I drank some electrolytes and that subsided. Anyways, my point still stands. This feeling is all ive wanted. I dont feel crazy happy but i feel capable and able aka no resistance to just existing.

I am really starting to see the results in the mirror and am trying to stick with it here. But I am having a problem with my electrolytes. I work a highly active job (construction), and stay pretty active during my off days (hiking, house/yard work, weight training, etc). I've always drank around 2 of the 20 fl oz Powerades a day on the usual (and a ton of water) simply because I like them and have always seemed to just be fairly thirsty and active person in general. So when I started keto I simply switched to Powerade Zero for 0g carbs. But I always seem to be fairly tired and exhausted since I started keto. And sometimes the day after I work a long day, or do more than 20K steps in a day, or do some heavy weight training, I feel like I'm starving and exhausted/dead the entire next day! My pee has also been consistently yellow and foamy since I started keto, no matter how much water or powerade I drink. I think I need to up my electrolytes and get rid of these headaches and exhaustion. From what I've read, you guys are all drinking the ketoade. Now, I understand that you all have a similar formula, ~1/2 tsp salt, ~1/2 tsp no-salt, and some mio, mixed with water. Some of you take a daily 400-500mg Magnesium supplement in addition as well. But, some of you take potassium powder supplements, some of you also eat avacados for potassium...\n\n(One thing I think we can all agree on, getting 4700mg of potassium everyday is about impossible unless your sitting in a tree eating bananas all day \ud83d\ude00\ud83c\udf4c)\n\nHere's the thing, I don't like avocados, kale, etc. Miss my fricken bananas terribly.

I reached my goal weight and surpassed it on several occasions. I\u2019m currently increasing calories but staying on keto, I got down to 52 kg and plan to stick to my current weight.

{"title": "Need motivation/Help - chasing that Keto glow again! :)", "selftext": "Hey! So I wanted to share a bit about my keto journey and get some tips/motivation from you too.\n\nI did keto for about a month and a half back in September\u2013October 2024, and honestly, it went better than I expected. I had to stop because I had a long vacation coming up, and sticking to keto while traveling just didn\u2019t feel realistic at the time.\n\nThe thing is \u2014 I *love* food. I enjoy trying new things, exploring restaurants, and just tasting random stuff, so giving that up completely is tough for me. But despite that, keto really surprised me. I noticed benefits I hadn\u2019t seen with any other way of eating.\n\nEven though I felt like my workouts lost a bit of intensity, I had this whole new relationship with food. My cravings vanished. I felt like I was finally in control \u2014 like *I was choosing food*, not the other way around. I could go to a restaurant and actually make mindful decisions instead of defaulting to bread or dessert.\n\nPhysically, I felt great: no period pain at all (which is super rare for me), no acid reflux, glowing skin, more focus and clarity, and I dropped about 10 lbs. The best part? I\u2019ve managed to keep most of it off. Even though I indulged a lot post-keto, I didn\u2019t gain more than 2 lbs back, which is honestly a win.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not quite at a point where I can commit to keto as a forever-lifestyle \u2014 I don\u2019t have that mindset yet. But I *do* want to get back into it starting April 20, and stick with it for another couple of months. My main motivation this time is to lose weight and regain that power over food.\n\nEven after I stopped keto, I noticed some of the habits stayed with me \u2014 like making more conscious choices and not needing constant snacks or sweets. I\u2019d love to tap back into that. That said \u2014 I\u2019m not super into cooking, so I\u2019m planning to use Factor to ease back in during the first week. Probably 3\u20134 dinners will come from there while I get into the groove. Last time, I kept my net carbs under 20g for the first two weeks and under 50g after that. This time, I\u2019m thinking of starting straight at 50g net carbs just to ease in more sustainably.\n\nWould love to know \u2014 **how did you get back into keto after a break?** What helped you stay consistent? Did you do anything different your second time around? I could really use a bit of ***motivation and a push*** right now.\n\nLet me know what worked for you \u2014 even the small stuff.

{"title": "Keto + IF is amazing wow!", "selftext": "I recently started a journey to optimize my metabolic health. I've been struggling with energy fatigue for well over 4 years now. Especially around lunchtime, if I eat any food, I experience a big energy crash where I feel like passing out. I feel jittery and sometimes get depressed. I thought this was just some mental health issue I had with external circumstances in my life and never appreciated how much of it was related to my metabolism.\n\nI've pretty much optimized other areas of my life. I workout almost everyday, sleep consistently (no phone usage at night and right when I wake up), take cold showers and do breathing exercises. These habits have really been awesome for me. But my energy levels had a spikiness to them. I'd have bursts of energy in the morning and crash at some point. It was brutal sometimes.\n\nAs my work life became stressful, I would sometimes just skip meals and noticed that I generally felt better. I found fasting to be one of the most consistent, tried and true methods to stabilize my mood and get good mental clarity. I got intrigued with this and wanted to know why that was happening. I learned that after a period of significant fasting, your body reaches a state of ketosis where it consumes fat for energy.\n\nWith that in mind, I decided I was going to do IF 20:4 fasting and a keto diet (30-50g carbs/day). I have early morning workouts which consist of HIIT, strength training, and long distance running. I break my fast around 3PM, and by then I have reached a deep state of ketosis. I use a ketone measurement device and get a reading of about 3 to 5 mmol/L.\n\nI would say I feel amazing with this protocol. The mental clarity and energy I have is insane. Feels like I have unlocked a new superpower. I am pretty much in action from early morning till I go to bed. My peak state is probably lower than it used to be and my workouts feel more challenging. But the energy level feels much cleaner and less noisy. None of the manic-like hype energy nor the low state energy level. I feel like I also can focus longer on a task and don't have an ADHD-like system.\n\nIn hindsight, it feels very obvious: food is what fuels your brain and body.

{"title": "First Month Down - Recap and Some Questions", "selftext": "First Month Down - Recap and Some Questions\n\nI (31M) had known about keto for at least a decade but it seemed intimidating for me, especially being a chubby guy who loves to eat. Weight has been up and down over the years, but almost always up. I hadn't weighed myself in a while and then about three years ago I was at 346 lbs and was shocked. I stayed at that for a year or two before adding daily walks and managing portions, which did get me down to 295 over about 6 or 7 months. Then earlier this year I saw a new doctor that highly recommended I give keto a shot. I knew I would try it after that but I still resisted for a month or two to make sure I savored carbs while I could. Then I finally took the plunge and love it! I had one day of the keto flu, then I just felt more energy and had a much better mood. I started weighing myself Sunday mornings, and the numbers kept dropping! In one month of keto I am down 25 lbs! I know a good portion of that is water weight, but it still feels awesome when the numbers go down every week (I'm used to disappointment so I always expect the weight to go up lol)\n\nThe first three weeks on keto I was tracking my macros on Cronometer. I tapered off using it starting the fourth week though because I was being more or less consistent with what I was eating and knew I was below my carb cap. Is this a dangerous habit though? I am still looking at labels and net carbs for any food I eat, but I feel like I have a pretty solid baseline understanding of keeping a mental record.\n\nThe only food I really miss is popcorn as that has been a favorite snack my whole life, I'm a little nervous to go to the theater too because that smell has power over me! I am an anxious person so I do have annoying dreams nearly every night where I binge eat carbs and feel guilty, then wake up relieved that it was only a dream.\n\nI've read that starting keto for 3 to 4 months straight is the best way to get adjusted, so when you do mess up it makes going back into ketosis much quicker, is that true? I've also heard people talk about accidentally getting kicked out of ketosis, will I know if I accidentally get kicked out and can I get back in within a day or two?\n\nLastly, thinking about keto long term, I don't see a reason I won't continue this even after I hit my goal weight now that I know how it feels, but my original plan was to get to my goal weight and then reintroduce carbs in moderation. I've also heard of maintenance keto, where people go into ketosis a few times a year just to keep their weight in check. Is that a successful strategy or is it better to try to stick with it as often as possible? Every time I've lost significant weight I've ended up regaining it and then some, and that is what my parents and older people in my life are saying will happen with this too. I just want to make sure this loss sticks.\n\n(I know a lot of these questions are heavily subjective and a person to person situation, but I like to hear the experience of others and what did and didn't work for them)\n\nThank you so much for any advice or input or recommendations or support!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1k0vziz/first_month_down_recap_and_some_questions/", "created_utc": 1744838899.0, "score": 5, "author": "twg15", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1k0vziz/first_month_down_recap_and_some_questions/", "html_title": ""}

Before that I had already just gotten all sugary drinks out of the house and was cutting calories etc - that was 2 or 3 weeks prior to REALLY cutting carbs.

I started hiking 2 - 3 miles every morning and just got a gym membership but that has mostly just been treadmill until I meet this trainer. If it matters, 60 days no cigarettes but using some nicotine to help. \n\nI did a much less thoughtful version of this diet almost 20 yrs ago. I basically just went full carnivore, but ignored things like sugars in sweet bologna or what was in the sauce on wings etc. Plus was drinking vodka, soda like a fish. I lost 66 Lbs really fast then (240 > 175). I clearly remember the cramping, mostly in legs back then and it seemed like potassium supplements fixed it. \n\nWelp, Ive been taking some potassium and magnesium along with another multi vitamin and drinking some of the Gatorlyte  Zero. Last night, during sex, they still hit pretty hard...and it kinda put a cramp in things (yes, I intended that one). I wasnt doin anything crazy at all, wasnt using a lot of energy. Really, without getting graphic, when the 1st leg cramps hit I was mostly lying stretched out. Ugh..all I can say is, it was bad...REALLY BAD timing and I need to know what I can do to prevent this. \n\nAs another side note, I never specifically saw a doctor for leg cramps, but I have gotten them for years, even when not on the diet. Mostly from dehydration I think. The times its been a almost a guarantee I'd get them has been when gambling late in casinos, drinking casino coffee. I wake up with the bad charlie horses that send me runnin in circles. When I go camping and its hot, Im sweating a lot, even if pounding gatorade, giarantee cramps 1st thing in morning.

I read somewhere recently that if your protein takes up too much of your calories then your body will start to burn your protein or basically burn your muscles for energy instead of fat. Obviously on keto that\u2019s not what you want, but my main workouts are weightlifting, and currently the biggest macro that I focus on high protein. Not excessively high, but the usual one gram protein per pound of bodyweight. But when I look at the percentages suggested for keto, it says that protein is going to be my smallest macro making up a maximum of 20% of my daily calories, which is gonna drop my protein by a lot like almost half! If I start keto, will I be shooting myself in the foot in terms of any muscle gains? For reference, I have done keto in the past, but the only thing I really tracked at that point was my carbs. This is all feeling extremely complicated this morning lol. I have a really hard time imagining that dropping my protein is going to be beneficial for wanting to have lean muscle mass, but I\u2019m really intrigued because I did it in the past although I did it for far too long for myself in the short term three months it was great and I lowered my body fat very quickly and I want to do that. I guess if I had to choose between the two right Now, I want to shed some body fat, but do I really have to choose?

{"title": "Questions before initiating phase 2", "selftext": "Hi all, follower of this group for a number of years now seeking your guidance once again. I Used this community, and a few other related ones, for information and support when I originally gave this whole keto thing the good ole college try back in 2019/2020. During the year that i did it, I was hugely successful, managing to drop from 232 to 185 lbs. Energy levels through the roof. Sleep schedule the healthiest it has ever been. Out performing all my peers at work. Cleared up my psoriasis and kept it cleared. No depression. No anxiety. So many amazing benefits, truly the best I've ever felt in my life was back then for just so many reasons... However there were a few road blocks I hit back then that I might like to try to avoid this time around so that hopefully I can avoid the very few negatives I was faced with and be able to roll this lifestyle until my time has come. Which brings me to my questions...\n\n1. What calorie deficit is optimal to run ? I ran a 40 percent deficit the last time around, but at a certain point. couldn't seem to keep losing anymore. Did it possibly have anything to do with that or am I good to go with 40 percent again? \n\n2. What can I do to help be able to handle CrossFit workouts while eating this way ? I found last time I couldn't maintain my workouts anymore after I almost collapsed and fainted during the groups WOD.\n\nFor additional background info - I did high protein moderate fat low carb keto eating 20g net carbs or less a day and strictly following calories eating at 40 percent deficit. I did 23:1 OMAD with occasional extended fasts to shake things up. Weighed in once a week. Updated my calories and macros every 10 lbs I lost. Weighed everything, prior to cooking. Logged everything, actually prelogged everything, so nothing would trip me up. I worked two jobs the whole time, so steps exceeded 10k a day. Gave up alcohol entirely. Electrolytes I won't lie I got overwhelmed trying to figure out so I just used boillion cubes in water here and there, and started salting food when I cooked which I never used to do.\n\nI am going to dive back in regardless of whatever feedback comes my way, but I just thought I'd try and do some digging as I realize one part of why i ultimately fell off and backtracked before was because I started to become really discouraged when my progress just stagnated and wouldnt seem to start back up again.

I've done keto/low carb on and off for a while now, regularly being under 20g of carbs per day for multiple months at a time and managing to shift a lot of the weight that's plagued me for a long time.\n\nAt the end of last year due to certain personal circumstances I ended up indulging way too much and put on a portion of the weight I had lost. I realised this from clothes not fitting etc. \n\nAnyway, back to being low carb for a couple months before Xmas (with a 3 day break over Xmas) and back on the wagon ever since with only 3 days of going over my carb allowance in that time.\n\nI've not managed to see a single shift in the scales since the start of the year. I realise initially that the issue actually WAS that my scales were broken (they were getting stuck at a certain number) - I verified this by re-weighing on a family members' and on a couple new sets I purchased to check for sure. So I think the initial issue was I was actually a fair bit heavier than I thought I was to begin with. Anyway, it's been a couple months now, I feel great, belt down 2 notches since Xmas etc, but the scales still haven't shifted from what I know is the new/real figure.\n\nThe only major difference to my diet from the previous times I have done low carb/keto is that I no longer have a bread called Livlife low carb seeded bread that I used to get, due to them no longer producing it, and replacing them with [these low carb wraps from Tesco.](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/308478994#review-container)\n\nMy calories in/out are where I think they should be, and I'm keeping under my carb allowance, and I've obviously seen changes to my waistline and clothing (having to rebuy recently too etc.) - however seeing the number not shift on the scales is a bit demotivating. Do you think there's a chance these wraps could be affecting me, causing my weight to stall?

{"title": "Persistent Irritability on Keto (Beyond Adaptation Phase) - Need Electrolyte Guidance (Dosage, Brands?)", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm hoping to get some advice from the experienced keto folks here. I've been trying to follow a ketogenic diet on and off because it provides me with some significant benefits, but I consistently run into one major roadblock: **persistent, overwhelming irritability.**\n\nThis isn't just the initial \"keto flu\" stuff during the first few weeks; it continues long after I should be adapted. It gets bad enough that I have outbursts, especially towards my family, which makes me feel terrible and ultimately leads me to quit the diet every time. As soon as I stop keto, the irritability goes away, but unfortunately, so do the benefits.\n\n**Why Keto is Important for Me:**\n\nI'm really motivated to make keto work long-term because it drastically helps with several issues:\n\n1. **Hyperseborrhea:** My severe oily skin and comedones completely clear up on keto, contrary to the common belief that fat increases sebum.\n2. **Bipolar Disorder:** My psychiatrist (who is very evidence-based) acknowledges that keto can be beneficial for bipolar disorder and potentially stabilizing. The irritability I experience is confusing, as he'd expect keto to have a calming effect.\n3. **Weight Management:** Medications I take for bipolar disorder make me prone to weight gain, and keto helps me stay in shape effectively.\n4. **Chronic SIBO:** I have chronic Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth following gastroenteritis years ago. This causes extreme bloating, shortness of breath, and discomfort due to gas trapped in the small intestine. Keto significantly reduces my SIBO symptoms (bloating goes down within months), likely by starving the bacteria of fermentable carbs.\n\n**The Problem & My Question:**\n\nThe irritability is the *only* reason I stop. I've read that keto increases electrolyte requirements and that an imbalance could potentially cause mood issues like irritability. I was quite surprised to read suggestions about needing *more* salt, as I've always been told to limit it.\n\nI suspect my electrolyte intake might be way off. Could this be the primary cause of my persistent irritability even after the adaptation phase?\n\nI'm looking for specific guidance:\n\n* Which electrolytes are most crucial to supplement on keto (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium seem common)?\n* What are the generally recommended *daily target amounts* (in milligrams) for each while on keto?\n* Are there any specific supplement brands you trust or recommend? Or effective DIY \"ketoade\" recipes?\n* Are there any *other* potential causes for long-term, persistent irritability on keto that I might be overlooking?\n\nI'm naturally a calm person, and these mood changes are distressing. Any insights, personal experiences, or concrete advice on managing electrolytes (or other potential causes) would be incredibly helpful. I really want to find a way to sustain this diet for its health benefits.\n\nThanks so much for reading and for any help you can offer!\n\n**TL;DR:** Keto offers me major health benefits (skin, bipolar support, SIBO relief, weight control), but persistent, long-term irritability (not just keto flu) forces me to quit. Suspecting electrolyte imbalance. Need advice on **which** electrolytes, **how much** (mg/day targets), trusted **brands/recipes**, and potential **other causes** for this ongoing irritability.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1juvl1h/persistent_irritability_on_keto_beyond_adaptation/", "created_utc": 1744166611.0, "score": 5, "author": "meilijoy", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1juvl1h/persistent_irritability_on_keto_beyond_adaptation/", "html_title": ""}

So [here I am today](https://imgur.com/a/9B04uNT) at 15 months, I've lost about 85 lbs and that's not factoring in the muscle I've put on. Things have slowed down considerably as I have less weight to lose, but I'm still on keto and loving it.  It's been another 9 months and sometimes it doesn't feel like I'm making progress anymore but then I look at my 6 months pic and don't even recognize myself, let alone my starting point.  There was along period of dysphoria where I'd look in the mirror and not even see myself, often seeing my uncle's face instead of my own.  But eventually my brain caught up and started to accept that the face I was seeing is me.  Now I look at old pics of me and can't even recognize myself, can't believe I let things get so bad.\n\nI've gone from wearing XXLs shirts/sweaters to fitting into a Medium, even that can be a bit big on me. I could probably wear pants with a 30\" waste if I could get them over my calves, meanwhile in the before pic I was wearing 42\" pants. I run often, did my first 15k the other day, and recently signed up for a 30km run so I am now training for that.  A year and a half ago I got winded walking up the stairs. I hit the gym almost every day (unless it's a running day). I just got back from a work trip and my flight was actually comfortable, my butt didn't hurt when I got off the plane and I didn't have to ask for a seatbelt extender (talk about embarrassing). Things that were once so hard are now easy; most notably I can cut my toenails without effort.  I also started playing squash again after 15 years.  I'm constantly thinking about what's next, maybe something new like dancing classes or getting back into martial arts. Everything that once seemed impossible is now possible.\n\nKeto has become a way of life for me. I actually don't enjoy sweets or anything like that anymore.  I just got back from a work trip where I allowed myself to go off diet for the week (when work is paying for fancy meals I don't want to pass that up). I ate and ate, but as soon as I got back I went right back on my diet.  I was eager to do so, I just feel so much better.  Not only did I put on 10lbs of water weight I just felt like crap, I was gassy, constantly hungry and other than a few treats like a slice of pizza I really didn't enjoy going off diet that much. People say it's not sustainable, but they're just projecting their own failures.  It's sustainable if you want it to be, and the longer you live that life the easier it gets.\n\nI'm not exactly sure where the finish line will be.  I started at 267lbs before I even thought of taking a \"before\" pic, my goal was to get under 250lbs so I could take a flying lesson on an ultralight. Then it was 225lbs, then to get under 200lbs... Now I'm thinking I'd love to get back to my college weight of 168 lbs, but of course that would me stopping at 99lbs so I will probably push to 167lbs so I can say I lost a 100lbs.  From there who knows, I feel quite comfortable in my 180lbs and will probably settle into that range and be happy.  But I'm really hoping to have a nice 6 pack when I get to 167 as that was something I never managed to accomplish when I was younger.\n\nAnyways, that's enough rambling.  If you have any questions, I'm happy to share my experience.  But most of all I hope to motivate some of you to do the same. If you want this bad enough you can achieve it.

{"title": "Here we go again..", "selftext": "Hi! I'm a female, 25 yrs old at a SW of 295, CW is 273.4. My current goal, which has been my goal for since January, is just to get under 270. I started really losing weight since October of last year, that's when my starting weight was. \n\nI've been on keto before and it was very successful, the only thing that did anything for me and worked. I lost around 75 lbs. I was at 230 and went to around 160. I got OFF of keto, even though I told myself it was going to be a life long commitment, because I developed schizophrenia and was going through psychotic episodes due to smoking a lot of weed 24/7, it being in my family, and not eating or sleeping for 3 days. I'm not quite sure what gave me it. But I had it in my head that the doctors wanted me to quit keto- even though they told me at the psych ward that whatever my diet was, they would cater to it while I was there recovering. It was a real bad time for me. When I got out, I kept off the diet, but then when I was gaining again, I kept trying, and failing, to go back on keto. \n\nI noticed recently, that anything carby, I over gorge myself. Whole wheat bread that's supposedly healthy? I'd eat the whole loaf cause it tasted so good. Clemintines? 12 in a day. Anything chocolate or pastry that I'd get in a sharable pack? I'd tell myself I'd only have one, and that it's all apart of a \"balanced\" diet, and then id eat the whole container. Why is it that I only have a good relationship with food when I am on keto? I don't feel strong urges to overconsume and I can even save the rest for later after I only eat half of it.\n\nI think im ready to commit to keto again. Idk if you guys want to hear any of this as it's my first day I'm doing this (actually, it's the end of my first day. I'm a third shifter and I'm about to sleep). But I had a lot of opportunities throughout the day to eat carbs and I chose not to every time. I wanna hear from the life long keto goers, if any of you have read this far. How do you keep ketoing on? I started in 2020 for a year. I think the main reason why I kept going off of keto was because I kept listening to the opinions online that keto was dangerous and everyone should be eating balanced. But I've been trying for so long, from calorie counting to intuitive eating, to eating whatever you want just IF or small portions. I've also heard that keto is just low calorie and that's how people lose weight. Which made me count calories and fail at that too! The only thing I did and it worked was keto. I let other people's opinions wreck havoc on my brain. \n\nIdk I'm only commenting here because I heard on low carb md podcast that engulfing yourself in a community and receiving support from it is what actually helps people stick to something long term. Also I've heard some brief talk about keto helping schizophrenia? What do yall think?

{"title": "Having periods of hyperinsulinemia is beneficial for height growth?", "selftext": "(I have open growth plates)\nI'm going to start this by saying that keto/carnivore's nutrional and vitamin profiles are excellent. My concern is about the lack of hyperinsulinemia, which can cause spikes in IGF-1 levels. My concern arose after reading this [rabbit study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9389521/). Basically, fasting for 48h caused chondrocyte depletion in the growth plates and nuked IGF-1 levels in rabbits. Even though hGH production was extremely ramped-up, IGF-1 levels plummeted because of hepatic resistance to hGH in the liver.\n\nHyperinsulinemia increases IGF-1 through the following mechanisms:\n1. \"insulin stimulates hepatic IGF-I synthesis\" [[src](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3308317/#:~:text=insulin%20stimulates%20hepatic%20IGF%2DI%20synthesis)]\n2. \"[it] increases the fraction of circulating free IGF-I by downregulating hepatic synthesis of IGFBP-1 and, to a lesser extent, hepatic secretion of IGFBP-2\" [[src](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3308317/#:~:text=increases%20the%20fraction%20of%20circulating%20free%20IGF%2DI%20by%20downregulating%20hepatic%20synthesis%20of%20IGFBP%2D1%20and%2C%20to%20a%20lesser%20extent%2C%20hepatic%20secretion%20of%20IGFBP%2D2)]\n3. \"higher insulin levels in the portal circulation upregulate the growth hormone receptor\" [[src](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2949481/#:~:text=higher%20insulin%20levels%20in%20the%20portal%20circulation%20upregulate%20the%20growth%20hormone%20receptor)], which should further increase IGF-1 because hGH causes IGF-1 secretion in the absense of hepatic resistance\n4.

{"title": "2.5 Month Update", "selftext": "I'm about two and a half months into my 2025 keto journey. Just to recap: I started at 265 pounds, my highest weight ever. This is heavy for me. I won't rehash my entire life story here \u2014 I've already offloaded most of that into personal audio journals \u2014 but growing up, I was always lean. The real weight gain began around age 20, after moving out and sliding into a cycle of drinking and partying. Though I kept the weight off for a few years, the groundwork for a bad lifestyle had already been laid. By 25, it had fully caught up to me. Add in a stressful job, shifting social circles, and unstable living situations, and the habits compounded. The result was a severely overweight body by my early 30s.\n\nA few reflections on life at 250 pounds and above. Having lived on both sides of the line\u2014healthy and obese\u2014I can say two things with certainty: (1) Being overweight is profoundly uncomfortable. Basic things, like putting on socks, feel like small battles. Existing becomes a sweaty, breathless endeavor. And (2) I never once forgot what it felt like to be healthy.\n\nThe first point is obvious. I struggle to believe anyone severely overweight is truly \"comfortable\" in their body, no matter what slogans we tell ourselves. You can love yourself, sure. But physical discomfort isn't something you can love away. And 250 pounds at six feet tall isn't even the extreme; I see people my height pushing 275 or 300 pounds. That cannot be a pleasant experience.\n\nThe second point \u2014 the memory of a healthy body \u2014 is the harder one. I was trapped in a body that felt foreign, but my mind never adjusted. I remain the first-person witness to an ongoing tension between my \"skinny mind\" and \"fat body.\" I'll use \"fat\" here not as a pejorative, but as a neutral descriptor\u2014a term that matches the reality of how I looked and felt. Some people feel differently about the word. I don't.\n\nThat's the primer. Now to the substance.\nI first tried keto from January to around October 2020. I started at about 250 pounds and dropped to 185 pounds\u2014without much exercise, while drinking alcohol, and eating plenty of \"dirty keto\" foods like burgers and bacon. Up close, it didn't look healthy. But from a distance\u2014month over month\u2014the results were clear. I lost weight steadily.\n\nEventually, though, I stopped keto without a plan. Between 2021 and late 2024, I put all the weight back on, and then some.\nWhat did I learn from round one? That I was far more comfortable living in a 185-pound body. That discipline matters. That keto worked, but it needed to be a longer-term commitment\u2014or at least have a real exit strategy. And so, four years later, here we are.\n\nBy 2025, I felt sick. Not myself. Every day, my weight confronted me\u2014not because I chose to focus on it, but because obesity makes itself impossible to ignore. I knew how to get into ketosis, so I did.\nI started again at 265 pounds. As of today, roughly 2.5 months in, I'm sitting around 235 pounds\u201430 pounds lighter. And this time, I'm locked in.\n\nMy approach remains \"dirty keto\": focus on low carbs and a caloric deficit, not on perfect food quality. I've been filling in gaps with supplements, plenty of water, electrolytes, and green drinks like AG1. I know I'll need to pivot to a cleaner version eventually\u2014and I plan to, once I approach 200 pounds. But for now, I'm drawing on advice a doctor gave me during my first keto round.\n\nBack then, I expressed concern about cholesterol and heart health. He said, \"Look\u2014you started at 250 pounds and now you're around 200. Any damage you did with the keto diet is far less than the damage you'd have done by staying obese.\" That framing still grounds me. It\u2019s better to lose the weight imperfectly than to remain trapped in an unhealthy body.\n\nSo that's my 2.5-month update. I hope it shows what's possible when keto is used properly. And to be clear, nothing here is professional advice\u2014I'm sharing my experience, not offering prescriptions. I spoke with my doctor before starting. We discussed medications like Contrave, GLP-1s like Ozempic, and even stimulant options. I trialed Contrave briefly. It didn't work. In the end, I chose keto, and my doctor supported it. He took baseline blood labs and scheduled a six-month follow-up to re-test.\n\nIf you're considering a major weight loss journey, talk to your doctor. Consider keto\u2014and consider that you may already know what you need to do, even if it\u2019s hard.\n\nI'll post another update when I hit 200 pounds. Maybe a final one when I reach 185 pounds\u2014my high school weight.\n\nCheers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jtmua8/25_month_update/", "created_utc": 1744036776.0, "score": 23, "author": "Final_Dissipate", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jtmua8/25_month_update/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "First post here. Backstory and 2 month progress", "selftext": "Hello people,\nSorry if this is a bit of a lecture but I just experienced a lot and I want to share.\n\nLittle backstory first: I (34) grew up overweight. Lost it in my late teenage years and my early adolescence years were at a normal weight. But everything crashed down in 2020. My mental issues escalated which lead to a lot of weight gain. 2024 was a horrible year for me so I decided to turn it around in 2025. \n\nSo I started keto 2 months ago. This was actually because I kept seeing things about the mental benefits. I was sceptical at first, but I also have a background in metabolic engineering and immunology so I trusted myself in applying it correctly for my own genetics. Plus I had gone vegan at the end of 2024 but it felt like I overlooked the main cause of my issues. I decided to also cut out possible allergens. So on the 7th of February, my one meal a day vegan keto gluten free diet started at 132.2 kg. \n\nThe first days I noticed my brain fog was disappearing and started feeling pretty good. So good I needed to adjust to my new mind set. I am recently diagnosed with autism and before I made the diet change I would have argued that I may also have ADHD. However those traits are almost entirely gone and I am now very confident that I am only autistic. Also very important to mention is that due to the lack of allergens, I have confirmed that I am very susceptible to histamine. Eating baba ganoush (egg plant), drinking beer or smoking cannabis (yep, also contains histamines!) will trigger my immune system and gives me swelling and headaches. Probably I low key had this for years. \n\nIt gets even better, the improved mental state made me figure out the root cause of a problem my body had for the last 5 years. My pelvis was tilted (yippie to autistic hypermobility). Thanks to google and chatGPT, I untilted my pelvis and stood up straight for the first time since covid.\n\nAnd as the closer, after 2 months of this diet I lost 19.5 kg. I know this is really fast but I am not losing muscle mass and it feels like my body is returning back to its natural base line.\n\nThanks for reading!

{"title": "Ketone & Ketosis Kuestions", "selftext": "Hello Keto peeps,\n\nI've been on the carnivore diet for 3 months now and finally got a blood ketone monitor to test my ketone levels. This morning I tested a couple hours after waking up (fasted) and only had 0.5mmol/L. I tested again half an hour later and got 0.8. In the past when I've tested my blood glucose levels its usually just around/below 3.5 mmol/L.\n\nI thought that after this much time (almost) zero carb my ketone levels would be higher. Was I wrong? If my ketones level is 0.5-0.8 in the morning, is it possible that it's dipping below 0.5 throughout the day? Also, am I fat adapted yet? I know that's a separate thing. \n\nI was really hoping to experience all the reported benefits of ketosis but so far progress has been slow. My skin is clearer and I've managed to eliminate snacking, but other than that, I feel pretty much exactly the same as I did when I was on a high carb diet. Haven't lost any weight, no improvements in mental clarity, focus, energy etc. \n\nFor reference, I eat only eggs, meat & coffee (1-2/day). Until about a week ago I wasn't eating dairy either but I've added heavy cream back into my coffee for now because I want the extra fat (I've been trying to increase my fat to ensure I'm not eating too much protein). The only carbs I've had is a little sriracha sauce here and there.

I ate almost no carbs, keeping it under 20g daily, mostly from vegetables.

Sometimes my heartbeat increases. I read somewhere that I need more electrolytes. Should I always be drinking water with salt to fix that problem?\n\n2.

{"title": "2 questions about Keto (and this subreddit)", "selftext": "Hello all!  I was here a few years back after going keto, and successfully managed to lose 40 pounds! My health was great, I had energy, and actually liked how I looked.  When I went off Keto, I stayed low carb, and was very proud of myself for actually managing to keep the weight off for a few years after.\nThen Covid hit.\nI'm a Healthcare care worker, and a stress eater. And my shifts went from 7-hour days Mon to Friday, to 10 hour shifts for 2 weeks at a time.  Due to no one really knowing how infectious this was, our usual cafeteria closed, as did my ability to store my meals in the staff fridge, which reduced what I was able to eat at work.  I eventually ended up eating poorly as I'd use high-sugar foods to give me energy during my shifts, and long story short, I ended up regaining almost all my weight back.\n(I explained this so you'll know why I'm asking for a resource. I also take full responsibility for regaining, nothing is wrong with the diet, it clearly works IF you stick to it.)\nWhen I was last here, I thought there was a page or link to a page that gave a \"Starting Keto shopping list\" - a list of the things to buy you'll need to have on hand almost all the time. Keto \"staples\", more or less.  Either it's been removed, or my 51 yr old eyes are failing because I can't seem to find it here anywhere.\n\nI also have a question about butter/margarine.\n\nI know butter is clearly better for you, and in the information links this place provides, it explains how butter has more Omega than margarine, etc.  My question is, is margarine actually BAD for the Keto diet, or is it just that butter is better? Is margarine ok if you supplement with omega?  I ask because for some strange reason, I'm not fond of the taste of butter.  I am, however, fond of the Becel brand Avacado oil margarine.  Can I continue to use it with Omega supplements, or is it better to just ditch it altogether and stay with butter.\n\nThanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jr6lpu/2_questions_about_keto_and_this_subreddit/", "created_utc": 1743753516.0, "score": 4, "author": "Quillsword2025", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jr6lpu/2_questions_about_keto_and_this_subreddit/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Keto, Cortisol, and a Teaspoon of Honey: A Surprising Sleep Hack", "selftext": "I came across some posts recently where people swore that taking a teaspoon of honey before bed helped stop them from waking up randomly in the night. At first, I dismissed it. I\u2019m one of those people who genuinely enjoys the keto lifestyle. I\u2019m strict about it, all the time. Keto has worked wonders for me, especially in clearing up life-long anxiety issues. So, naturally, I ruled out the honey trick because of its sugar content and the risk of getting kicked out of ketosis.\n\nBut then I started to think more deeply about *why* it might work.\n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with a pretty severe case of the dawn phenomenon. That frustrating early-morning spike in blood glucose. My fasting morning glucose levels often hover around 7.0 mmol/L until around noon, even though my carb intake is consistently below 20g per day. It didn\u2019t make sense. I knew I wasn\u2019t insulin resistant anymore as keto fixed that. So why the elevated glucose?\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me: maybe the issue isn\u2019t carbs... maybe it\u2019s *cortisol*.\n\nHere\u2019s my theory: Cortisol naturally rises in the early morning hours (part of the body\u2019s circadian rhythm), and it stimulates gluconeogenesis\u2014the liver\u2019s production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. This is one reason people experience elevated blood glucose in the morning, even when fasting.\n\nI figured by taking a small amount of honey ; approx. 5 to 10g of sugar, it would cause a gentle rise in blood glucose, and trigger an insulin response. That insulin, in turn, might *blunt* the overnight cortisol spike. And if that cortisol surge is what was waking me up at 2 or 3 a.m. or contributing to high glucose upon waking, dampening it could mean deeper sleep and better metabolic readings by morning.\n\nSo, I tried it. Just one teaspoon of raw honey before bed.\n\nThe next morning, despite my skepticism, I was surprised. My glucose was down to 5.4 mmol/L. I hadn\u2019t woken up in the middle of the night. I actually slept straight through, which hasn't happened in a long time. Even more surprising was that my ketone levels were still at 1.0 mmol/L. I was still in ketosis.\n\nI tried it again the next night. Same results. Exact same numbers. Obviously coincidental as this is not a precise game- but really pleasing.\n\nWhat I thought was just an old wives' tale turns out to have some very real metabolic mechanics behind it. Of course, this might not work for everyone. Some people are more sensitive to carbs, and some may find that even a small amount of sugar knocks them out of ketosis. But for me, eating strictly low-carb all day seems to have given my body enough metabolic flexibility to tolerate this micro-dose of honey without derailing my progress.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep experimenting, but so far? I\u2019m seriously impressed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jpr4wm/keto_cortisol_and_a_teaspoon_of_honey_a/", "created_utc": 1743607014.0, "score": 390, "author": "houvandoos", "num_comments": 119, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jpr4wm/keto_cortisol_and_a_teaspoon_of_honey_a/", "html_title": ""}

I've always been fit but I found out about keto and it seemed to be a much better diet than the one I was having \u2014 high-carb \u2014 so I decide to try keto.\n\nMy experience was somewhat disastrous. I went into keto without no problem for 10 days.  \nAt 10th day I had a keto flu but I couldn't understood because I was in keto for 10 days \u2014 how haven't I had the flu before? Something must have been wrong.\n\nThe symptoms I had was irregular heart beat and I was feeling nervous, which for me was something new in my entire life. And the irregular heart beat really scared me. I went to the hospital. When I got there they didn't care much, they thought it was anxiety and simply prescribed some anxiety pills.\n\nOnly then I found out about the electrolyte imbalance. I urinated a lot that night and only got better after drinking some electrolytes.\n\nBut the following weeks were a mess. I was getting anxiety all the time \u2014 and I couldn't understand it because I never had it for my entire life. I got carbs back, and I started feeling less anxious. I started to understand the anxiety was related to the food I was taking.  \n  \nEvery time I tried to cut back on carbs and get into keto again the anxiety increased. I even started to wake up at night with numb arms and lost the sleep entirely for a few days, which got me to the hospital again, to again be prescribed with anxiolytics.  \n\nNow I understanding that all these symptoms seem related with two things: electrolyte imbalance for sure, and potentially not enough calories.\n\nSolving the electrolyte imbalance is easy.\n\nBut when it comes to calories I find it very hard to get to 1800 kcals under keto.\n\nI've searched a few meal plans and they almost always stay under 1500 kcals, which isn't enough for me.\n\nI am 170cm and I went from 63 kg to 58 kg in 2 months and I haven't really been on keto for a 1/4 of it (as I always tend to get back to carbs to get more calories from time to time). (58 kg might not sound too little, but I (still) am muscular, so I am simply very short of body fat.)\n\nThe problem I tend to find is that I can't eat the 150g of fat that I supposedly need, unless I am eating whole slices of butter, which honestly doesn't feel healthy at all, much less tasty.\n\nI do like olive oil and butter, but on a normal amount. I am also not going to eat 50g or more of nuts everyday.\n\nSo my question is, how can one do keto without calorie deficit (e.g. 3 meals of >600 kcals per day) while sticking with a diet that is based as much as possible on unprocessed food, including olive oil and butter (which while only mechanically processed, are nonetheless processed and it doesn't feel natural to eat a bunch of it everyday)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jpr2pr/keto_for_nonfat_guys/", "created_utc": 1743606861.0, "score": 1, "author": "LocationConscious599", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jpr2pr/keto_for_nonfat_guys/", "html_title": ""}

Honestly, I\u2019m more likely to undereat than overeat (never thought I\u2019d say that, god I love this WOE) because I\u2019m usually only hungry 2x a day. I know that brief undereating is okay when you have a lot of body fat to lose, but like I said I\u2019m very close to a normal BMI. \n\nI should mention that I will be loosely counting carbs (but I really don\u2019t come close to going over on those).

{"title": "Hit the longest plateau ever, 6 months. How can I break this with keto", "selftext": "Hi! Let me break down the specs about me. Currently 28(F), 5'3 last weight today at 210.8 lbs. started my weight loss journey back in December 2023 started at 261 lbs, the most I brought my weight down was 199 lbs. I was so happy bc it's been so long that I've been the below 200! However my weight has been fluctuating between 206 - 211 lbs for the past 6 months, but 4 months ago I brought it down to 199 lbs. Reason I was able to do that was because I was doing intermediate fasting for 23 hours and had a 1 hour period to eat, I was eating decently (was not on keto yet) and I managed to loose 8 pounds from 207 to 199lbs and did cardio burning up to 1000 calories a day, but I felt super depressed because how super strict I have to be with myself limiting myself so much I couldn't really enjoy eating periodically throughout the like a more healthier window period of intermittent fasting ex 16:8. So I tried that instead and ended up gaining the weight back to my fluctuating weights again! Would I have to do this again or can their be a more healthier option to do this. Back in 2020, I did keto, that time I weighed 232 and was able to bring down my weight to 201 lb by doing dirty keto (meats and high fats, no veggies) lost 31 pounds in 3 months, I was eating throughout the day, didn't even know much about fasting that time, but still manage to burn the weight off, I'm going back on keto again and plan to see if I can break out of this plateau officially so I can see the weight fall, I also been measuring myself and have been seen the same measurements. I don't consume a lot of calories at is it, no sugar, I do track my calories and it's typically about 1000 calories a day, I do cardio for about 90 mins 3-4 times a week.

Importantly, we find that administering ketones, which can fuel neurons while bypassing insulin resistance, reverses brain aging effects.

I wasn\u2019t eating any carbs besides net carbs in that ice cream bars. I ate carbs when I got back home but after a few days I wanted to get back to that feeling I had on my work trip so I did research and realized I was probably in ketosis and that I wanted to get back into it. I started eating as much fat as I could, like trying to get to 200 grams but I\u2019d end up around 180. I wasn\u2019t having any carbs, basically eating the same way as I was on my work trip but more fat because I thought that\u2019s what I needed. I ended up eating around 2000-25000 calories a day. 2 weeks I didn\u2019t get into ketosis once and I gained weight.

I need a win!", "selftext": "I have been on keto in the past and lost about 70lbs then with only tracking net carbs and not even going to the gym (I was moderately active with my dogs and sometimes walking to work).\n\nI went off it initially because of a terrible living situation and drama which made it hard to stay on track when surrounded by awful people etc.\n\nSo I restarted last April and did well for a couple months to then have another traumatizing event caused by another person.\n\n\nFast forward to this year. I started back up in March 2025 and have not eaten outside of the diet so far and I feel better.\n\nHowever, I am feeling a bit lost as I am not making progress like I did or want to. I am also probably being unrealistic. Thank mental illness I supposed.\n\nSo the good part:\n\n- My appetite is in check (I have an eating disorder so this is awesome).\n\n- I don't mindlessly eat or snack. \n\n- I cook more (I do enjoy new recipes)\n\n- I drink a lot more water \n\n- I don't crave soda and if I want bubbles I enjoy the Bubly brand seltzers but majority of my drinking is water (I don't like coffee, I don't drink alcohol, and I only ever have tea if I am making bullet proof tea and this is mostly a pick me up thing)\n\nThe part I am not happy with:\n\n - the scale. I know this is just a way to track here and there but I feel like the amount of progress I have made this should have improved.\n\n- I can't tell if intermittent fasting is doing anything good or bad other then puting me on a schedule to eat and not eat (which I guess is the basic things for IF) I always did 16:8. I would fast from 9pm to 1pm the next day as I am not big on eating first thing in the morning normally.\n\n- I don't notice changes in clothing fitting or anything else.\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm just being too hard on myself but I want this to workout.\n\nI have also been adding some physical activity to just get stronger: i.e. sit ups, weights, planks. And I walk with dogs.\n\nMy highest weight was 280lb back in 2019. I got down to 208lb then and then my ex ruined that and I gained back a lot (however my clothes mostly still fit). So April 2024 I was at 278lb and starring in March 2025 I weighed 250lb. And last week I was 240lb and this week I am 245lb (mind you I started my period this week so that may affect the random weight gain as I fluctuate 5lbs that time of the month).\n\nI keep my net carbs under 20 and rarely hit 20 on a normal day. I make it a point to eat less processed stuff and majority of the things I eat are what I made from scratch. The only sweetener I use if I do use one is monk fruit as it does not make me feel bad or weird like others do.\n\nAny advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ke780k/looking_for_advice_to_stay_on_track_i_need_a_win/", "created_utc": 1746318218.0, "score": 3, "author": "Prestigious_Sound_29", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1ke780k/looking_for_advice_to_stay_on_track_i_need_a_win/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Trying to eliminate harmful foods from my diet with a continuous blood glucose monitor.", "selftext": "Hi guys, I've been using a blood glucose monitor to analyze the foods I am eating to watch for what is  spiking my blood sugar unexpectedly. I was intermittent fasting until I got this monitor but have begun to test certain foods by themselves, give myself a 2 hour window to allow for the spike, and then try another food. What I'm wondering is what amount of spike should I be concerned with? Ideally no spikes would be ideal and many foods don't seem to spike me at all but if I eat any products with carbs, I do see my blood sugar rise. I don't see many in the keto community talking about monitoring blood sugar like this or what levels are of concern but I do see many talking about intermittent fasting & keeping blood sugar spikes to a minimum so I'm guessing that many just don't bother to test this way. \n\nHas anybody been using a continuous glucose monitor to test & what level of glucose spike do you find unacceptable? I've already determined that me and my best friend have very different spikes even when we eat the same exact thing. I seem to be very sensitive to carbs and he is not so much. \n\nSo last night I ate some Caprese salad (mozzarella, tomatoes, balsamic vinaigrette, olive oil & basil) and saw a 30mg spike. I'm thinking this is too much. I don't eat this a lot & it's well under 20 carbs but the spike makes me think I should I be avoiding this in the future. \n\nAnother concerning food was ham. 1 carb per 3ounce serving (it says on the package). I noticed a spike when I ate it with an omelet the other day so I decided to try one serving on it's own this morning and it spiked my blood sugar about 25mg. \n\nAre these small spikes nothing to worry about or should I be trying to eliminate foods that spike me at all from my diet completely?

It was recommended to my parents and I when I was 230 lbs due to insulin resistance at age 14. \nI began my lifestyle change at the beginning of that school year, so August and by May I was 150 lbs. I have been able to keep it off with few bouts of fluctuations but this time is different. \nIn August 2024, I had my first gallbladder attack and had to begin eating a low fat to keep the attacks at bay until I could have it removed, which took running around til November with the American healthcare system to be able to do so. Normally, My comfortable weight is 150-155lbs, as a 5\u20195 woman. However, I weighed in at my one month post-op appointment in December 2024 at 195 lbs. I decided I was going to let myself have Christmas, then I would be going back onto this lifestyle. \nDecember 28th, 2024 is when I began this journey again. I log EVERYTHING in the Lose it app. A typical day for me is 2 pieces of Keto bread from Aldi, toasted with a tablespoon of almond butter and 3 pieces of back and 2 boiled eggs for breakfast. For lunch I do a turkey sandwich with Aldi Keto bread, dressed with mayo and mustard, with a turkey Chomps stick, almonds, and black olives. For dinner, I wish up between Steak with broccoli, Crack Chicken, Chicken with Queso and Cauliflower rice, or I make Keto pancakes with Almond flour and Allulose. (Would also like to say I have lost weight with Aldi\u2019s Keto bread previously) \nI have had ONE treat meal this whole time, which was for my partner and I\u2019s anniversary back in February. My weight loss: 15 lbs. \nI was truly hoping to be somewhat close to my goal weight of 150 lbs again at this point and I\u2019m getting very discouraged. I do work an office job, I burn about 400 calories a day and I try to stay in a calorie deficit using the TDEE calculator. I have not had this slow of weight loss with Keto before and I am feeling frustrated. Lastly, I am 5 days into a journey of quitting nicotine. So, other than adding more chewing gum and sugar free mints into my diet, I do my best to stay away from them. No sugar free candy, protein bars, or ice creams in my diet.

{"title": "Benefits of Allulose", "selftext": "After having GI issues with artificial sweeteners, I found Allulose to be the best all around choice for me. Here are some of the reasons.\n\nAllulose and GLP-1:\nAllulose has been found to stimulate the release of GLP-1, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes feelings of fullness. This stimulation of GLP-1 can lead to improved glucose tolerance and reduced weight gain. \nMechanism of GLP-1 release:\nAllulose's effect on GLP-1 release may be related to its ability to cause intestinal distension, which can trigger the release of GLP-1. This mechanism may involve vagal afferent nerves, which are connected to the brain and can influence appetite and food intake. \nPotential benefits:\nThe increase in GLP-1 caused by allulose is associated with several potential benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, reduced body weight gain, and enhanced glucose tolerance. \nClinical implications:\nThe findings suggest that allulose may be a valuable tool for managing blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss, potentially offering an alternative to traditional sweeteners or even medications that mimic GLP-1. \nResearch ongoing:\nWhile research has shown promising results, further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which allulose stimulates GLP-1 release and its long-term effects on various aspects of metabolic health. \n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11207032/#:~:text=Our%20results%20showed%20that%20allulose%20mitigated%20the,body%20weight%20gain%20and%20improved%20insulin%20resistance.&text=GLP%2D1%2C%20a%20hormone%20involved%20in%20glucose%20regulation,glucose%20tolerance%20and%20reducing%20weight%20gain%20[9%2C22].\n\nBlood Sugar Management:\nAllulose does not significantly impact blood glucose or insulin levels, making it a good option for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. It may also help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. \nWeight Loss:\nAllulose is low in calories and does not contribute to weight gain or fat storage. Some studies suggest it may help increase fat loss, including visceral fat. \nLiver Health:\nAllulose may help reduce fat accumulation in the liver, potentially lowering the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It may also help reduce inflammation in the liver. \nOral Hygiene:\nAllulose doesn't contribute to tooth decay, promoting oral health and reducing the risk of cavities. \nKeto-Friendly:\nAllulose is a suitable sweetener for individuals following keto or low-carb diets as it doesn't negatively impact blood sugar levels. \nGluten-Free:\nAllulose is naturally gluten-free.\nPotential Anti-Inflammatory Effects:\nSome research suggests allulose may have anti-inflammatory properties, potentially by regulating certain inflammatory pathways. \nOther Potential Benefits:\nAllulose may also help reduce oxidative stress, improve liver health, and promote satiety (feeling of fullness). \nImportant Considerations:\nModeration:\nWhile allulose is generally considered safe, it's recommended to consume it in moderation, as high doses may cause digestive discomfort. \nMore Research Needed:\nWhile promising, more long-term studies are needed to fully understand all the potential benefits and risks of allulose. \nNot an Artificial Sweetener:\nAllulose is a rare sugar that naturally occurs in some fruits and is not classified as an artificial sweetener.

I topped out at 483 (maybe a bit more), started this journey at 482 and am now at 249. Still want to drop another 91 to a goal weight of 158. Also, zero exercise (until 5 days ago).\n\nIt was easy to keep going because my progress was dramatic:\n\nWeigh ins:\n\n4/28/2024: 482\n\n5/31/2024: 439\n\n6/29/2024: 416\n\n7/31/2024: 394\n\n9/1/2024: 368\n\n9/30/2024: 348\n\n10/31/2024: 328\n\n12/4/2024: 310\n\n1/1/2025: 294\n\n2/1/2025: 285\n\n3/3/2025: 269\n\n4/3/2025: 259\n\n5/1/2025: 249\n\nI've done Keto in the past but struggled to maintain it.  This time, I found the key for me: sugar (and sugar substitutes).  Aspartame, \"sugar alcohols,\" all that stuff, I had always thought was keeping me on track, but instead it was just keeping the struggle and temptations going.\n\nI was very tired of \"starting my diet\" only to fail at 4pm, so I did something very drastic I only did once before: A water fast.  I was careful to keep taking electrolytes to do it safely.  I was able to make it to 15 days.  I did this because I wanted a reset, something I couldn't screw up and figured I couldn't eat the wrong thing if I just didn't eat.\n\nFor me, this fast broke my cravings.  I slowly reintroduced foods and never went back to anything sweet at all, the sweetest thing I've had in the last 366 days is a macadamia nut.  I can go to holiday meals with family, see all the delicious food and it doesn't tempt me at all.  I can talk about all the things I used to crave and it doesn't even move the needle.  I honestly think sugar had been the trouble all along, too many \"cheater foods\" like the Atkins treats and such. Occasionally I will still skip a random day or two if I'm busy, just to show myself I'm still in control.\n\nAn analogy I came up with: It feels as if the cravings, the food noise, was a big bear. I could wrestle it for awhile and hold it down for a bit, but eventually it would win.  The fast put that bear into hibernation and now I only have to fend off the occasional townspeople that come looking for it.  Much simpler.\n\nMy meals are pretty simple. I will grill 2 NY strip steaks, eat one sometimes with a can of green beans or cooked broccoli (with avocado oil & sea salt), sometimes just the steak.  Then I'll put the other one in the fridge and warm it in the air fryer the next day.  Then I'll do 2 days of chicken, same thing.  Sometimes I'll throw in a fish/shrimp day. Very simple.  Almost always grilled, even through the snowy winter.  I usually eat mid-afternoon. All of my food comes from Aldi or Costco.  Even with the steaks, it's cheaper than how I was eating before. I can eat for 2 days with less than $10 with chicken from Aldi. I am also taking a multi-vitamin and a few others vitamins, etc.\n\nThe biggest struggle for me has been the mixed nuts.  I found a bag of raw mixed nuts at Aldi I like quite a bit and will get into them with some cheese and before I know it, I went through a lot of them, as a consequence, it's slowed my weight loss.  I did get a shot glass for portion control but that hasn't been working.  I need to cut these out or drastically scale back.\n\nAll of this had been WITHOUT dedicated exercise.  According to my watch, I only averaged 4,302 steps per day in the last 12 months.  This has been because my hips really bother me.  I was hoping this would fix itself with weight loss and time, but it's still there.\n\nThe last 5 days, I've started walking, the first 2 days were 1.5 miles each and the last 3 days have been 2 miles each.  It's not a ton, but I want to keep my step count over 10k going forward.\n\nThe biggest downside has been a bit of low energy and tiredness, but honestly these walks have REALLY made me feel a lot better, so I am going to keep doing it, no matter what.  Today it was raining...still...2 miles.\n\nNow I want to get under 200 pounds by October so I need to start moving to get the monthly loss higher, I know I can do it. Just got to keep moving!\n\nI just wanted to share.  I had been just recently selling all of my old clothes as I had a lot of nice dress shirts. Obviously the people that showed up were the size I was and was very shocking to me to see this as it really showed how far I've come.  Until about 3 months ago, I did not really realize how much weight I had lost until I started noticing that I fit into things like movie theater seats and freaking cars much better.  It's really been an eye opener.\n\nI will NEVER go back.

{"title": "Celebrating My First Month on Keto \u2013 Results and more", "selftext": "\nHey, everyone! I wanted to share my experience and results after committing to the keto diet and a healthier lifestyle for the entire month of April. It's just the beginning of my journey to a healthier body and a more joyful life, but it's such a great start!\n\n For some context, I\u2019m a woman in my 30s. I started at 92 kg on April 1st, and as of today, I\u2019m at 87 kg! That\u2019s a 5 kg drop, and I\u2019m feeling amazing, even though I heard people lose more.\n\nI also measured some parts of my body and I could see that I lost some centimetres here and there. It's visible without the measuring tape but I enjoy tracking it!\n\nBut the changes aren\u2019t just physical, I\u2019ve noticed some serious improvements in how I feel mentally and emotionally, too.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did to stay on track:\n\nI focused purely on staying keto without counting calories (I plan to start that in May). I really listened to my body and made sure not to overeat.\n\nI didn\u2019t cheat, but I made sure my food was delicious. I really made the effort to enjoy every meal. I'm a gpod cook, so that's lucky!\n\nEven when eating out, I stuck to keto-friendly options, like a Caesar salad without croutons or a burger without the bun. I also took some pistachios with me as an emergency snack \ud83d\ude05\n\nI kept a mindful food journal, focusing on how I felt about what I ate and how much I ate\u2014this helped me stay present and aware of my choices.\n\nI walked at least 45 minutes every day and stayed active by dancing, swimming, and generally finding any excuse to move (as long as it wasn\u2019t painful!).\n\nI aimed for 7-8 hours of sleep a night, and when I didn\u2019t get enough, I\u2019d take a nap if I could.\n\n\nThe changes I\u2019ve noticed:\n\n1. My mood is so much more stable, I feel calmer, and it\u2019s way easier to find joy in little things. As someone with a history of anxiety, this has been a huge improvement.\n\n\n2. PMS is much better, I used to deal with mood swings, bloating, and pain for 5-10 days before my period, but this month, I barely noticed any of those symptoms! The only mild pain I felt was on the day of my period, which is actually today (TMI, haha).\n\n\n3. Hair loss : So, I\u2019ve been losing hair like crazy every time I wash it for the past year. I used to have thick, curly, and big hair (which I love). It\u2019s still curly and big, but I could definitely see how much I was shedding each time I washed it. Honestly, people probably wouldn\u2019t notice, but I could tell. However, just two days ago, I washed my hair and was seriously shocked\u2014it was like a miracle! I only lost about 25% of the usual amount that I used to shed. It\u2019s a small win, but for me, it\u2019s a big deal. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s keto, the extra protein, or just sheer luck, but I\u2019m hoping this side effect stays.\n\n\n4. Overall, I feel strong, beautiful, and stable\u2014like my body and mind are finally working together in harmony.\n\n\n\nI know it\u2019s not all about the numbers, but I\u2019m celebrating the mental and physical changes I\u2019ve experienced. And, of course, I want to reward myself for this month of hard work, so I\u2019ve been thinking about treating myself to one of the following:\n\n1. An air fryer (I know, I\u2019m a millennial without one\u2014what\u2019s wrong with me?)\n\n\n2. Massage treatments\n\n\n3. A new Nintendo Switch (I\u2019ve been really wanting to play more games!)\n\n\nBut I\u2019d love to hear any other ideas or what you\u2019ve done to reward yourself. Let me know what you think!\n\n\nMuch love to you all\u2014remember to love and accept yourself, and always make taking care of your health your top priority, not impressing others. \ud83d\udc95\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kc7a8z/celebrating_my_first_month_on_keto_results_and/", "created_utc": 1746101833.0, "score": 56, "author": "DreamyBi-ch", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1kc7a8z/celebrating_my_first_month_on_keto_results_and/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sugar addiction? How to cope with insane cravings?", "selftext": "I did keto / paleo for years. I lost a lot of weight once on it, and after I just stayed on it, not necessarily too strict but I just felt a lot better when eating mostly meats and fish and veggies. \n\nLast year I was in a really rough place, which meant I wasn't able to eat anymore. At one point, since I was feeling very horrible it was decided that any calories were better than none. So every night around midnight if I wasn't able to eat all day, I would just eat some high-caloric things like carrot cake to make up for at least some calories I burned and I switched to sodas during the day for some energy. I wasn't drinking sodas before. \n\nMy hunger has returned and I was able to stop medication that made me gain a lot of weight. During the carrot cake diet period I already lost 39 lbs / 18 kg, but I still have weight to lose. \n\nI'm having trouble sleeping, feel restless and unable to concentrate. I also have ADHD, the meds suppress thirst a lot which causes me to drink around one litre a day instead of the 4,5 I should be drinking. \n\nI wanted to get back onto keto to lose the excess weight. For three weeks now I have been going in and out of ketosis since the cravings get insane. I never experienced this. I'm craving sweet things so much, even after I'm in ketosis. Before it was relatively easy, but now, it's like something took possession of me, and I made the mistake of purchasing keto bars which sometimes lead me to eat five in a row. Also downing soda zero like it's nobody's business. \n\nI think it's fair to say I got addicted to sugar in that carrot cake and soda period. ADHD has always caused impulsivity issues for me, which doesn't help, and it's also making it difficult I feel like to get grip of the situation and get organized enough to handle what's coming. \n\nI have trouble drinking water, but I'm doing the best I can with electrolytes in water which also adds some taste. \n\nAnd the sugar cravings gets so bad I just don't care about losing weight for my health at that moment. I spiral during a couple of days, until reality hits me and I try again, determined to get into ketosis and repeat. \n\nI feel like a loser lacking willpower, and I am really not sure how to do this. If anybody has been in the same position and has any advice for me, please share. \n\nI'm embarrassed to admit I even smoked weed a couple of times to deal with the nerves of being jittery from wanting sugar, which then caused the munchies and caused me to eat all the keto bars or all the black berries I have lying around. I can try to go for walks etc, but I would just be walking around all night, not getting tired and still end up doing the same thing. \n\nI'm eager to break this cycle and take control of my health. It's been a shitty couple of years and with things finally looking up, I was hopeful to taking charge of my health and live a life worth living again. So I feel like a loser that now when my health issues have finally subsided and received proper treatment, the part of my healing journey which is really up to me is not happening due to lack of willpower it seems. I do really wanna do this, but I really feel like I'm lacking something to help me cope. \n\nI hope someone has some advice to offer as this cycle is making me feel the opposite of what I was going for. \n\nPlease no tough love or hate or shaming, as I am already feeling enough like a loser and am very embarrassed. I'm just reaching out for some advice. Thank you kindly.

Was this the common thinking back then?\n\n\"Most prominent among the waste products of burning fat are a group of chemicals called ketones. As long as you\u2019re burning fat, your body will be subjected to a constant dose of extra ketones in the blood, a condition referred to as ketosis. Ketones are, in the contempo- rary argot, toxic waste, and the prospect of subjecting yourself to a long-term dose of them is off-putting to anybody contemplating a diet.\n\nBut the alternative, not losing weight, is much less healthy. With a little knowledge and a simple trick, ketones can be conquered. First, while ketones are toxic, they\u2019re only slightly so. Dieting won\u2019t make you see huge hairy bats (unless, of course, you saw huge hairy bats before). Second, the waste products of burning fat aren\u2019t insidious\u2014they don\u2019t accumulate in the body like heavy metals or some organic toxins. Instead, they get swept out of the bloodstream by the kidneys and liver and are excreted in fairly short order.

I take it as a sign to take more mag when sodium exacerbates palpitations. Taking calcium for balance, just in case. As soon as it's in, i can feel my muscles stiffen and my vision sort of lose it's clarity.\nThere are times when I take a little potassium and go, ah I needed this! But additional supplementation usually sends me to the bathroom v quickly and leaves me with aching muscles, so, actually, it was Mag...\n\nFor background knowledge, been almost constantly dieting for 9yrs(not too strict, watching calorie intake & working out regularly), started supplementing electrolytes only around 3 years ago, when I started keto. \n\nStarted keto in the first place for what I now suspect to be symptoms of Mg deficiency(brain fog, no energy). Wanted to be in a normal, happy, energetic state of mind and body so badly. But **even though I supplemented the RDA of Mg, then later 600mg, then later even 1000mg occasionally, my condition simply continued to deteriorate.** \n\nThere wasn't even one pinpoint symptom I could talk about. I felt negative about life, then felt almost nothing at all. I had barely enough energy to exercise, though I have a good amount of muscle I've built up throughout the years. \n\nThough I wondered if the years of dieting were taking their toll on me(looked through so many posts on diet fatigue) I'd never starved myself, and took care to eat nutritious, reasonable calories. Tried eating a bit over maintenance and that did nothing to help my stamina or brain fog.\n\nThe last part sort of gave me a clue-with the speed with which my condition fluctuated, almost hourly, if not daily, if it wasn't calories, perhaps it was electrolytes-and I landed with the only thing that's made a dent in my ailing(?), excessive magnesium. \n\nI'm currently about 3 weeks into this high a dosage, of course a very short time, but I'm continuing to see improvements and little side effects. Honestly hoping very much that there will be a saturation point somewhere in the future, that I'll be able to flatten out with a more reasonable daily dosage.\n\nThe moment I really felt I was onto something was when I felt certain points on my tongue tingling, as if electrified, then a little later, the sense of taste I hadn't even known had gone returned. Then, a few days later, I could smell the subway, as I hadn't for god knows how many years-and it really stank. Also can still feel facial muscles relaxing when the Mg hits, my eyelids sliding all the way over my eyes. -Actually, to make an unending list of symptoms short, feels like **the reversing of peripheral neuropathy, or even neuropathy in general**? All sorts of senses and emotions-yes, I can finally enjoy past favorites with full blown emotions!-and memories waking up as if the nervous system is revving back to life. **This return to action is very short lived, however, if I don't keep up the torrent of Mg powder/pills/sprays**, and foggy darkness descends over my mind and body once more.\n\nThough I'm happy I've finally stumbled onto something that looks like a genuine answer, **still I'm troubled, mostly about the copious amount** I need. I'm well aware that this could take a toll on my kidneys, especially in the long term-though as I said, I'm hoping this is only a temporary requirement-and that other minerals can get tanked by the excessive Mg. Wondered now and then if there is some other ailment underlying what seems to be just a huge Mg deficiency, but then I get full body checkups every year, the results saying I'm healthy overall-so I'm just going to take that it indeed is a huge Mg deficiency. \n\nWould really put my mind more at ease, though, to know that there **are others who experienced something similar to what I'm going through**.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kasoo3/anybody_else_need_an_insane_amount_of_magnesium/", "created_utc": 1745945275.0, "score": 34, "author": "moy3931", "num_comments": 68, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1kasoo3/anybody_else_need_an_insane_amount_of_magnesium/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Felt lots of things, but never woozy or faint, so I ketoed on.\n\nFor those who have had more testing done/are more familiar with diabetes, can hypoglycemia be a sign of early insulin resistance? And how might I be able to distinguish that from other regular, run of the mill hypoglycemia? Is there a better way to go about determining if you're pre-diabetic than testing glucose?

I don\u2019t eat keto labeled foods like bread or tortillas. I quit diet soda which is huge for me. I still feel good but I\u2019m just sad that the scale is not moving the way I\u2019d hoped. \n\nI am not a fan of counting and know that is a quick way to derail my progress with controlling my eating. I try to stick to two meals a day. Initially snacking wasn\u2019t an issue but I noticed I have started snacking on nuts or string cheese between meals. Water is a daily battle and I was using electrolytes daily in the beginning but have since stopped. I just need to know what I can do better. I have a feeling counting will be the solution but I know that is a slippery slope. Any advice would be much appreciated.

{"title": "Ketoade & Potassium (Confused) I know this gets mentioned a lot...", "selftext": "Hello all! I've been on keto for about 4 months now. I am really starting to see the results in the mirror and am trying to stick with it here. But I am having a problem with my electrolytes. I work a highly active job (construction), and stay pretty active during my off days (hiking, house/yard work, weight training, etc). I've always drank around 2 of the 20 fl oz Powerades a day on the usual (and a ton of water) simply because I like them and have always seemed to just be fairly thirsty and active person in general. So when I started keto I simply switched to Powerade Zero for 0g carbs. But I always seem to be fairly tired and exhausted since I started keto. And sometimes the day after I work a long day, or do more than 20K steps in a day, or do some heavy weight training, I feel like I'm starving and exhausted/dead the entire next day! My pee has also been consistently yellow and foamy since I started keto, no matter how much water or powerade I drink. I think I need to up my electrolytes and get rid of these headaches and exhaustion. From what I've read, you guys are all drinking the ketoade. Now, I understand that you all have a similar formula, ~1/2 tsp salt, ~1/2 tsp no-salt, and some mio, mixed with water. Some of you take a daily 400-500mg Magnesium supplement in addition as well. But, some of you take potassium powder supplements, some of you also eat avacados for potassium...\n\n(One thing I think we can all agree on, getting 4700mg of potassium everyday is about impossible unless your sitting in a tree eating bananas all day \ud83d\ude00\ud83c\udf4c)\n\nHere's the thing, I don't like avocados, kale, etc. Miss my fricken bananas terribly. And just want to try a supplement. BUT, there is some confusion for me about how you can't take to much of the 99mg potassium pills without the danger of stopping your heart or burning a hole in your stomach, but yet they sell 1200mg gummies on Amazon... What's the difference in the two? How much sodium and potassium do you estimate is in your ketoade (~1/2 tsp salt, ~1/2 tsp no-salt, and some mio, mixed with water)?

Still, I always tried to balance my weekly calories and made sure I was eating at least 1500 kcal per day.\n\nI\u2019ve also been traveling a lot (currently in Korea/Japan/Vietnam for the next 2months, previously in Malaysia, Thailand, China+SAR, Taiwan), which has affected my sleep and made it even harder to stay 100% keto. Over the past few weeks, there were some days I completely fell off, but overall I\u2019ve been trying to stick to high-fat, high-protein meals.\n\nToday was the first time I measured myself since January, and honestly\u2026 I\u2019m a bit disappointed. Most of the fat still feels like it's sitting around my stomach. I expected more progress by now.\n\nHas anyone else been through something similar? Is this normal with all the travel/sleep disruption/occasional alcohol? Any tips or motivation would be super appreciated!\n\nedit: ya'll are right. I called a few friends from back home and all they've been doing is complementing me on the change. I think I have an image issue with myself and I'll have to deal with that as I move forward. Also I compared two photos, one from the beginning to one recently and I can definitely see more definition.

{"title": "Why did I drop out of keto?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been IF and keto the last few months and overall really happy with the way it\u2019s going. But\u2026 I\u2019ve got a continuous ketone monitor that links to my phone and trying to figure out what makes me drop out of ketosis. \n\nSo today I fasted all day and got home from work around 5pm with a good ketone level. Dinner was still a couple of hours away so I had a few (thin) slices of cheddar cheese (okay like 5 thin slices), a handful of roasted Brazil nuts and a handful of roasted almonds. \n\nDropped right out of keto in the hour after that - went from 1.3mmol/l to 0.4 in an hour then eventually right on to zero. I don\u2019t feel like I should\u2019ve had that reaction with that level of carbs. Anyone got any insights?\n\nUPDATE & RESPONSE: Thanks for the responses. \nSome more info and clarifications...\n - The continuous ketone monitor is new to the market in New Zealand, no prescription required. It works the same as a continuous glucose monitor, so is in fact measuring blood continuously. Its made by SiBio\n - The nuts were unpackaged/unsalted/unspiced etc. I roasted them myself from raw bulk nuts\n - Likewise the cheese was standard cheddar rather than processed, ie; no numbers for ingredients and the labe stated <1g carbs per 100g. The slices are pretty thin, maybe 2mm thickness but I guess the protein would be a culprit here especially coming out of a fasted state\n - I'm fasting from 2100 to 1600 the next day generally.

{"title": "Need motivation/Help - chasing that Keto glow again! :)", "selftext": "Hey! So I wanted to share a bit about my keto journey and get some tips/motivation from you too.\n\nI did keto for about a month and a half back in September\u2013October 2024, and honestly, it went better than I expected. I had to stop because I had a long vacation coming up, and sticking to keto while traveling just didn\u2019t feel realistic at the time.\n\nThe thing is \u2014 I *love* food. I enjoy trying new things, exploring restaurants, and just tasting random stuff, so giving that up completely is tough for me. But despite that, keto really surprised me. I noticed benefits I hadn\u2019t seen with any other way of eating.\n\nEven though I felt like my workouts lost a bit of intensity, I had this whole new relationship with food. My cravings vanished. I felt like I was finally in control \u2014 like *I was choosing food*, not the other way around. I could go to a restaurant and actually make mindful decisions instead of defaulting to bread or dessert.\n\nPhysically, I felt great: no period pain at all (which is super rare for me), no acid reflux, glowing skin, more focus and clarity, and I dropped about 10 lbs. The best part? I\u2019ve managed to keep most of it off. Even though I indulged a lot post-keto, I didn\u2019t gain more than 2 lbs back, which is honestly a win.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not quite at a point where I can commit to keto as a forever-lifestyle \u2014 I don\u2019t have that mindset yet. But I *do* want to get back into it starting April 20, and stick with it for another couple of months. My main motivation this time is to lose weight and regain that power over food.\n\nEven after I stopped keto, I noticed some of the habits stayed with me \u2014 like making more conscious choices and not needing constant snacks or sweets. I\u2019d love to tap back into that. That said \u2014 I\u2019m not super into cooking, so I\u2019m planning to use Factor to ease back in during the first week. Probably 3\u20134 dinners will come from there while I get into the groove. Last time, I kept my net carbs under 20g for the first two weeks and under 50g after that. This time, I\u2019m thinking of starting straight at 50g net carbs just to ease in more sustainably.\n\nWould love to know \u2014 **how did you get back into keto after a break?** What helped you stay consistent? Did you do anything different your second time around? I could really use a bit of ***motivation and a push*** right now.\n\nLet me know what worked for you \u2014 even the small stuff.

{"title": "Keto + IF is amazing wow!", "selftext": "I recently started a journey to optimize my metabolic health. I've been struggling with energy fatigue for well over 4 years now. Especially around lunchtime, if I eat any food, I experience a big energy crash where I feel like passing out. I feel jittery and sometimes get depressed. I thought this was just some mental health issue I had with external circumstances in my life and never appreciated how much of it was related to my metabolism.\n\nI've pretty much optimized other areas of my life. I workout almost everyday, sleep consistently (no phone usage at night and right when I wake up), take cold showers and do breathing exercises. These habits have really been awesome for me. But my energy levels had a spikiness to them. I'd have bursts of energy in the morning and crash at some point. It was brutal sometimes.\n\nAs my work life became stressful, I would sometimes just skip meals and noticed that I generally felt better. I found fasting to be one of the most consistent, tried and true methods to stabilize my mood and get good mental clarity. I got intrigued with this and wanted to know why that was happening. I learned that after a period of significant fasting, your body reaches a state of ketosis where it consumes fat for energy.\n\nWith that in mind, I decided I was going to do IF 20:4 fasting and a keto diet (30-50g carbs/day). I have early morning workouts which consist of HIIT, strength training, and long distance running. I break my fast around 3PM, and by then I have reached a deep state of ketosis. I use a ketone measurement device and get a reading of about 3 to 5 mmol/L.\n\nI would say I feel amazing with this protocol. The mental clarity and energy I have is insane. Feels like I have unlocked a new superpower. I am pretty much in action from early morning till I go to bed. My peak state is probably lower than it used to be and my workouts feel more challenging. But the energy level feels much cleaner and less noisy. None of the manic-like hype energy nor the low state energy level. I feel like I also can focus longer on a task and don't have an ADHD-like system.\n\nIn hindsight, it feels very obvious: food is what fuels your brain and body.

{"title": "First Month Down - Recap and Some Questions", "selftext": "First Month Down - Recap and Some Questions\n\nI (31M) had known about keto for at least a decade but it seemed intimidating for me, especially being a chubby guy who loves to eat. Weight has been up and down over the years, but almost always up. I hadn't weighed myself in a while and then about three years ago I was at 346 lbs and was shocked. I stayed at that for a year or two before adding daily walks and managing portions, which did get me down to 295 over about 6 or 7 months. Then earlier this year I saw a new doctor that highly recommended I give keto a shot. I knew I would try it after that but I still resisted for a month or two to make sure I savored carbs while I could. Then I finally took the plunge and love it! I had one day of the keto flu, then I just felt more energy and had a much better mood. I started weighing myself Sunday mornings, and the numbers kept dropping! In one month of keto I am down 25 lbs! I know a good portion of that is water weight, but it still feels awesome when the numbers go down every week (I'm used to disappointment so I always expect the weight to go up lol)\n\nThe first three weeks on keto I was tracking my macros on Cronometer. I tapered off using it starting the fourth week though because I was being more or less consistent with what I was eating and knew I was below my carb cap. Is this a dangerous habit though? I am still looking at labels and net carbs for any food I eat, but I feel like I have a pretty solid baseline understanding of keeping a mental record.\n\nThe only food I really miss is popcorn as that has been a favorite snack my whole life, I'm a little nervous to go to the theater too because that smell has power over me! I am an anxious person so I do have annoying dreams nearly every night where I binge eat carbs and feel guilty, then wake up relieved that it was only a dream.\n\nI've read that starting keto for 3 to 4 months straight is the best way to get adjusted, so when you do mess up it makes going back into ketosis much quicker, is that true? I've also heard people talk about accidentally getting kicked out of ketosis, will I know if I accidentally get kicked out and can I get back in within a day or two?\n\nLastly, thinking about keto long term, I don't see a reason I won't continue this even after I hit my goal weight now that I know how it feels, but my original plan was to get to my goal weight and then reintroduce carbs in moderation. I've also heard of maintenance keto, where people go into ketosis a few times a year just to keep their weight in check. Is that a successful strategy or is it better to try to stick with it as often as possible? Every time I've lost significant weight I've ended up regaining it and then some, and that is what my parents and older people in my life are saying will happen with this too. I just want to make sure this loss sticks.\n\n(I know a lot of these questions are heavily subjective and a person to person situation, but I like to hear the experience of others and what did and didn't work for them)\n\nThank you so much for any advice or input or recommendations or support!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1k0vziz/first_month_down_recap_and_some_questions/", "created_utc": 1744838899.0, "score": 5, "author": "twg15", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1k0vziz/first_month_down_recap_and_some_questions/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Cramps", "selftext": "So Ive been doin Keto to lose weight for approx a month now. Before that I had already just gotten all sugary drinks out of the house and was cutting calories etc - that was 2 or 3 weeks prior to REALLY cutting carbs. Ive lost around 30 Lbs of a 65 Lb goal (started at max weight of 250 sloppy lbs). I started hiking 2 - 3 miles every morning and just got a gym membership but that has mostly just been treadmill until I meet this trainer. If it matters, 60 days no cigarettes but using some nicotine to help. \n\nI did a much less thoughtful version of this diet almost 20 yrs ago. I basically just went full carnivore, but ignored things like sugars in sweet bologna or what was in the sauce on wings etc. Plus was drinking vodka, soda like a fish. I lost 66 Lbs really fast then (240 > 175). I clearly remember the cramping, mostly in legs back then and it seemed like potassium supplements fixed it. \n\nWelp, Ive been taking some potassium and magnesium along with another multi vitamin and drinking some of the Gatorlyte  Zero. Last night, during sex, they still hit pretty hard...and it kinda put a cramp in things (yes, I intended that one). I wasnt doin anything crazy at all, wasnt using a lot of energy. Really, without getting graphic, when the 1st leg cramps hit I was mostly lying stretched out. Ugh..all I can say is, it was bad...REALLY BAD timing and I need to know what I can do to prevent this. \n\nAs another side note, I never specifically saw a doctor for leg cramps, but I have gotten them for years, even when not on the diet. Mostly from dehydration I think. The times its been a almost a guarantee I'd get them has been when gambling late in casinos, drinking casino coffee. I wake up with the bad charlie horses that send me runnin in circles. When I go camping and its hot, Im sweating a lot, even if pounding gatorade, giarantee cramps 1st thing in morning.

{"title": "Any other foods high in worthless protein, like pork rinds?", "selftext": "You may have noticed that when you buy pork rinds, it says on the bag that despite having 7\u201310g of protein per serving, it's not a significant source of protein. My understanding is that the collagen that makes up the protein content in pork rinds is deficient in amino acids, so you're basically just getting the calories of the protein but without the muscle-building aspects. I'm sure plenty of people have eaten pork rinds thinking they were getting significant protein, but were instead just eating empty calories.\n\nThis made me wonder if there are other foods where this is the case. I assume there's some labeling threshold where you no longer have to put that the protein is insignificant. Sometimes I buy cheap turkey sausages and I notice they have some soy protein also, and I wonder if this is a way to get away with showing a high-protein content while using worthless collagen, using just enough soy to avoid a \"not a significant source of protein\" declaration.

But when I look at the percentages suggested for keto, it says that protein is going to be my smallest macro making up a maximum of 20% of my daily calories, which is gonna drop my protein by a lot like almost half! If I start keto, will I be shooting myself in the foot in terms of any muscle gains? For reference, I have done keto in the past, but the only thing I really tracked at that point was my carbs. This is all feeling extremely complicated this morning lol. I have a really hard time imagining that dropping my protein is going to be beneficial for wanting to have lean muscle mass, but I\u2019m really intrigued because I did it in the past although I did it for far too long for myself in the short term three months it was great and I lowered my body fat very quickly and I want to do that. I guess if I had to choose between the two right Now, I want to shed some body fat, but do I really have to choose? What will happen if I keep my protein, a larger portion of my calories?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jzsmp8/confused/", "created_utc": 1744725679.0, "score": 12, "author": "ReasonableComplex604", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jzsmp8/confused/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

However, with the supps, whole food organic diet, still something wasn't right... \n\nAnyway, attending nutritional therapy college and meeting a rogue Keto-er in the midst of many vegans who looked very ill, endlessly eating soups and rye bread and lentils.. he taught me about Paleo movement, Keto, and Dr Jack Kruse.

{"title": "Questions before initiating phase 2", "selftext": "Hi all, follower of this group for a number of years now seeking your guidance once again. I Used this community, and a few other related ones, for information and support when I originally gave this whole keto thing the good ole college try back in 2019/2020. During the year that i did it, I was hugely successful, managing to drop from 232 to 185 lbs. Energy levels through the roof. Sleep schedule the healthiest it has ever been. Out performing all my peers at work. Cleared up my psoriasis and kept it cleared. No depression. No anxiety. So many amazing benefits, truly the best I've ever felt in my life was back then for just so many reasons... However there were a few road blocks I hit back then that I might like to try to avoid this time around so that hopefully I can avoid the very few negatives I was faced with and be able to roll this lifestyle until my time has come. Which brings me to my questions...\n\n1. What calorie deficit is optimal to run ? I ran a 40 percent deficit the last time around, but at a certain point. couldn't seem to keep losing anymore. Did it possibly have anything to do with that or am I good to go with 40 percent again? \n\n2. What can I do to help be able to handle CrossFit workouts while eating this way ? I found last time I couldn't maintain my workouts anymore after I almost collapsed and fainted during the groups WOD.\n\nFor additional background info - I did high protein moderate fat low carb keto eating 20g net carbs or less a day and strictly following calories eating at 40 percent deficit. I did 23:1 OMAD with occasional extended fasts to shake things up. Weighed in once a week. Updated my calories and macros every 10 lbs I lost. Weighed everything, prior to cooking. Logged everything, actually prelogged everything, so nothing would trip me up. I worked two jobs the whole time, so steps exceeded 10k a day. Gave up alcohol entirely. Electrolytes I won't lie I got overwhelmed trying to figure out so I just used boillion cubes in water here and there, and started salting food when I cooked which I never used to do.\n\nI am going to dive back in regardless of whatever feedback comes my way, but I just thought I'd try and do some digging as I realize one part of why i ultimately fell off and backtracked before was because I started to become really discouraged when my progress just stagnated and wouldnt seem to start back up again. There's were major life traumas too but that's another story. We tackle what we can control.

To be fair, I've actually been doing keto for years but every now and then I'll take a break and then come back to it. But this time, I've on it for a solid year straight.\n\nI'm a 5'10\" male with a medium size/muscular build. When I started up again, I was 207lbs which was kind of shocking to me because I don't ever remember ever being over 200lbs except a brief stint when I hit 217 when I first started going to the gym and was eating everything.\n\nAs of today, I'm 196lbs and this number just won't move any further and it has been months.

What's strange is I remember a few years ago, I got down to 176 and I don't really remember my diet being much different. The only different thing I can think of is less keto snacks and I wasn't working out as much.\n\nI added up every single item on my heaviest meal day and it came out to 1,930 calories. An average day is around 1,800. According to BMR/weight loss calculators, to maintain weight, I should be eating 2,448 calories which I'm not coming close to. For weight loss, it says 1948. If that's the case, shouldn't I be losing at the minimum 1lb a week? \n\nI'm just confused and not sure where I go from here. Should I reduce my calories to 1,500 and keep at that for awhile?

I realise initially that the issue actually WAS that my scales were broken (they were getting stuck at a certain number) - I verified this by re-weighing on a family members' and on a couple new sets I purchased to check for sure. So I think the initial issue was I was actually a fair bit heavier than I thought I was to begin with.

{"title": "Persistent Irritability on Keto (Beyond Adaptation Phase) - Need Electrolyte Guidance (Dosage, Brands?)", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm hoping to get some advice from the experienced keto folks here. I've been trying to follow a ketogenic diet on and off because it provides me with some significant benefits, but I consistently run into one major roadblock: **persistent, overwhelming irritability.**\n\nThis isn't just the initial \"keto flu\" stuff during the first few weeks; it continues long after I should be adapted. It gets bad enough that I have outbursts, especially towards my family, which makes me feel terrible and ultimately leads me to quit the diet every time. As soon as I stop keto, the irritability goes away, but unfortunately, so do the benefits.\n\n**Why Keto is Important for Me:**\n\nI'm really motivated to make keto work long-term because it drastically helps with several issues:\n\n1. **Hyperseborrhea:** My severe oily skin and comedones completely clear up on keto, contrary to the common belief that fat increases sebum.\n2. **Bipolar Disorder:** My psychiatrist (who is very evidence-based) acknowledges that keto can be beneficial for bipolar disorder and potentially stabilizing. The irritability I experience is confusing, as he'd expect keto to have a calming effect.\n3. **Weight Management:** Medications I take for bipolar disorder make me prone to weight gain, and keto helps me stay in shape effectively.\n4. **Chronic SIBO:** I have chronic Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth following gastroenteritis years ago. This causes extreme bloating, shortness of breath, and discomfort due to gas trapped in the small intestine. Keto significantly reduces my SIBO symptoms (bloating goes down within months), likely by starving the bacteria of fermentable carbs.\n\n**The Problem & My Question:**\n\nThe irritability is the *only* reason I stop. I've read that keto increases electrolyte requirements and that an imbalance could potentially cause mood issues like irritability. I was quite surprised to read suggestions about needing *more* salt, as I've always been told to limit it.\n\nI suspect my electrolyte intake might be way off. Could this be the primary cause of my persistent irritability even after the adaptation phase?\n\nI'm looking for specific guidance:\n\n* Which electrolytes are most crucial to supplement on keto (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium seem common)?\n* What are the generally recommended *daily target amounts* (in milligrams) for each while on keto?\n* Are there any specific supplement brands you trust or recommend? Or effective DIY \"ketoade\" recipes?\n* Are there any *other* potential causes for long-term, persistent irritability on keto that I might be overlooking?\n\nI'm naturally a calm person, and these mood changes are distressing. Any insights, personal experiences, or concrete advice on managing electrolytes (or other potential causes) would be incredibly helpful. I really want to find a way to sustain this diet for its health benefits.\n\nThanks so much for reading and for any help you can offer!\n\n**TL;DR:** Keto offers me major health benefits (skin, bipolar support, SIBO relief, weight control), but persistent, long-term irritability (not just keto flu) forces me to quit. Suspecting electrolyte imbalance. Need advice on **which** electrolytes, **how much** (mg/day targets), trusted **brands/recipes**, and potential **other causes** for this ongoing irritability.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1juvl1h/persistent_irritability_on_keto_beyond_adaptation/", "created_utc": 1744166611.0, "score": 3, "author": "meilijoy", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1juvl1h/persistent_irritability_on_keto_beyond_adaptation/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Ketone & Ketosis Kuestions", "selftext": "Hello Keto peeps,\n\nI've been on the carnivore diet for 3 months now and finally got a blood ketone monitor to test my ketone levels. This morning I tested a couple hours after waking up (fasted) and only had 0.5mmol/L. I tested again half an hour later and got 0.8. In the past when I've tested my blood glucose levels its usually just around/below 3.5 mmol/L.\n\nI thought that after this much time (almost) zero carb my ketone levels would be higher. Was I wrong? If my ketones level is 0.5-0.8 in the morning, is it possible that it's dipping below 0.5 throughout the day? Also, am I fat adapted yet? I know that's a separate thing. \n\nI was really hoping to experience all the reported benefits of ketosis but so far progress has been slow. My skin is clearer and I've managed to eliminate snacking, but other than that, I feel pretty much exactly the same as I did when I was on a high carb diet. Haven't lost any weight, no improvements in mental clarity, focus, energy etc. \n\nFor reference, I eat only eggs, meat & coffee (1-2/day). Until about a week ago I wasn't eating dairy either but I've added heavy cream back into my coffee for now because I want the extra fat (I've been trying to increase my fat to ensure I'm not eating too much protein).

{"title": "Having periods of hyperinsulinemia is beneficial for height growth?", "selftext": "(I have open growth plates)\nI'm going to start this by saying that keto/carnivore's nutrional and vitamin profiles are excellent. My concern is about the lack of hyperinsulinemia, which can cause spikes in IGF-1 levels. My concern arose after reading this [rabbit study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9389521/). Basically, fasting for 48h caused chondrocyte depletion in the growth plates and nuked IGF-1 levels in rabbits. Even though hGH production was extremely ramped-up, IGF-1 levels plummeted because of hepatic resistance to hGH in the liver.\n\nHyperinsulinemia increases IGF-1 through the following mechanisms:\n1. \"insulin stimulates hepatic IGF-I synthesis\" [[src](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3308317/#:~:text=insulin%20stimulates%20hepatic%20IGF%2DI%20synthesis)]\n2. \"[it] increases the fraction of circulating free IGF-I by downregulating hepatic synthesis of IGFBP-1 and, to a lesser extent, hepatic secretion of IGFBP-2\" [[src](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3308317/#:~:text=increases%20the%20fraction%20of%20circulating%20free%20IGF%2DI%20by%20downregulating%20hepatic%20synthesis%20of%20IGFBP%2D1%20and%2C%20to%20a%20lesser%20extent%2C%20hepatic%20secretion%20of%20IGFBP%2D2)]\n3. \"higher insulin levels in the portal circulation upregulate the growth hormone receptor\" [[src](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2949481/#:~:text=higher%20insulin%20levels%20in%20the%20portal%20circulation%20upregulate%20the%20growth%20hormone%20receptor)], which should further increase IGF-1 because hGH causes IGF-1 secretion in the absense of hepatic resistance\n4. Insulin is molecularly similar to IGF-1, so more insulin means more IGFBPs that are bound to insulin instead of IGF-1, giving you even more free IGF-1\n\nIs my only option to spike my insulin with fruit every time my hGH is high(e.g. after exercise, in the morning(after fasting for ~13h)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1juc7jk/having_periods_of_hyperinsulinemia_is_beneficial/", "created_utc": 1744114896.0, "score": 1, "author": "EphemeralScythe", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1juc7jk/having_periods_of_hyperinsulinemia_is_beneficial/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Here we go again..", "selftext": "Hi! I'm a female, 25 yrs old at a SW of 295, CW is 273.4. My current goal, which has been my goal for since January, is just to get under 270. I started really losing weight since October of last year, that's when my starting weight was. \n\nI've been on keto before and it was very successful, the only thing that did anything for me and worked. I lost around 75 lbs. I was at 230 and went to around 160. I got OFF of keto, even though I told myself it was going to be a life long commitment, because I developed schizophrenia and was going through psychotic episodes due to smoking a lot of weed 24/7, it being in my family, and not eating or sleeping for 3 days. I'm not quite sure what gave me it. But I had it in my head that the doctors wanted me to quit keto- even though they told me at the psych ward that whatever my diet was, they would cater to it while I was there recovering. It was a real bad time for me. When I got out, I kept off the diet, but then when I was gaining again, I kept trying, and failing, to go back on keto. \n\nI noticed recently, that anything carby, I over gorge myself. Whole wheat bread that's supposedly healthy? I'd eat the whole loaf cause it tasted so good. Clemintines? 12 in a day. Anything chocolate or pastry that I'd get in a sharable pack? I'd tell myself I'd only have one, and that it's all apart of a \"balanced\" diet, and then id eat the whole container. Why is it that I only have a good relationship with food when I am on keto? I don't feel strong urges to overconsume and I can even save the rest for later after I only eat half of it.\n\nI think im ready to commit to keto again. Idk if you guys want to hear any of this as it's my first day I'm doing this (actually, it's the end of my first day. I'm a third shifter and I'm about to sleep). But I had a lot of opportunities throughout the day to eat carbs and I chose not to every time. I wanna hear from the life long keto goers, if any of you have read this far. How do you keep ketoing on? I started in 2020 for a year. I think the main reason why I kept going off of keto was because I kept listening to the opinions online that keto was dangerous and everyone should be eating balanced. But I've been trying for so long, from calorie counting to intuitive eating, to eating whatever you want just IF or small portions. I've also heard that keto is just low calorie and that's how people lose weight. Which made me count calories and fail at that too! The only thing I did and it worked was keto. I let other people's opinions wreck havoc on my brain. \n\nIdk I'm only commenting here because I heard on low carb md podcast that engulfing yourself in a community and receiving support from it is what actually helps people stick to something long term. Also I've heard some brief talk about keto helping schizophrenia? What do yall think?

The next step would be research into a lobectomy, which is basically cutting out a part of my brain.\nAnyway, I was having a bad streak of a lot of seizures in a short amount of time and I started doing keto. A brilliant idea of my wife.\nI have now been seizure-free for 5 weeks. I'm guessing it might work!\n\nI give you this context to highlight the importance for me to stay in ketosis, even if it was only to experiment.\n\nThe trouble is I test myself with a blood-ketone meter and always stay around 0.7, 0.9. I think that's a bit too much on the edge. I would love for it to go to 1.5 so if I'd accidently eat something with too many carbs I won't accidently trigger a seizure.\n\nI'll give you an example of the things I eat throughout the day.\nYesterday I ate:\nMorning: 4 eggs with butter and salt\nLunch: 2 fatbombs (coconutoil with stevia, a quarter of a crushed macadamian nut, pure cacaopowder) and 3 eggs with lots of butter\nDinner: meatbroth with meat and fatty cuts, which did have some onion in it, some garlic and some celery.\n\nI only drank water and some tea in the morning with coconutfat and stevia.\n\nToday I am trying to not eat for a while see if fasting can fasttrack a deeper ketosis.\n\nI measured my blood ketone lvls at night.\nI take a whole lot of pills and supplements too.

{"title": "15 Months Progress", "selftext": "Figured it was time for a follow-up to my [6 Months and a Day Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1e1k84h/six_months_and_a_day/). So [here I am today](https://imgur.com/a/9B04uNT) at 15 months, I've lost about 85 lbs and that's not factoring in the muscle I've put on. Things have slowed down considerably as I have less weight to lose, but I'm still on keto and loving it.  It's been another 9 months and sometimes it doesn't feel like I'm making progress anymore but then I look at my 6 months pic and don't even recognize myself, let alone my starting point.  There was along period of dysphoria where I'd look in the mirror and not even see myself, often seeing my uncle's face instead of my own.  But eventually my brain caught up and started to accept that the face I was seeing is me.  Now I look at old pics of me and can't even recognize myself, can't believe I let things get so bad.\n\nI've gone from wearing XXLs shirts/sweaters to fitting into a Medium, even that can be a bit big on me. I could probably wear pants with a 30\" waste if I could get them over my calves, meanwhile in the before pic I was wearing 42\" pants. I run often, did my first 15k the other day, and recently signed up for a 30km run so I am now training for that.  A year and a half ago I got winded walking up the stairs. I hit the gym almost every day (unless it's a running day). I just got back from a work trip and my flight was actually comfortable, my butt didn't hurt when I got off the plane and I didn't have to ask for a seatbelt extender (talk about embarrassing). Things that were once so hard are now easy; most notably I can cut my toenails without effort.  I also started playing squash again after 15 years.  I'm constantly thinking about what's next, maybe something new like dancing classes or getting back into martial arts. Everything that once seemed impossible is now possible.\n\nKeto has become a way of life for me. I actually don't enjoy sweets or anything like that anymore.  I just got back from a work trip where I allowed myself to go off diet for the week (when work is paying for fancy meals I don't want to pass that up). I ate and ate, but as soon as I got back I went right back on my diet.  I was eager to do so, I just feel so much better.  Not only did I put on 10lbs of water weight I just felt like crap, I was gassy, constantly hungry and other than a few treats like a slice of pizza I really didn't enjoy going off diet that much. People say it's not sustainable, but they're just projecting their own failures.  It's sustainable if you want it to be, and the longer you live that life the easier it gets.\n\nI'm not exactly sure where the finish line will be.  I started at 267lbs before I even thought of taking a \"before\" pic, my goal was to get under 250lbs so I could take a flying lesson on an ultralight. Then it was 225lbs, then to get under 200lbs... Now I'm thinking I'd love to get back to my college weight of 168 lbs, but of course that would me stopping at 99lbs so I will probably push to 167lbs so I can say I lost a 100lbs.  From there who knows, I feel quite comfortable in my 180lbs and will probably settle into that range and be happy.  But I'm really hoping to have a nice 6 pack when I get to 167 as that was something I never managed to accomplish when I was younger.\n\nAnyways, that's enough rambling.  If you have any questions, I'm happy to share my experience.  But most of all I hope to motivate some of you to do the same. If you want this bad enough you can achieve it.

{"title": "First post here. Backstory and 2 month progress", "selftext": "Hello people,\nSorry if this is a bit of a lecture but I just experienced a lot and I want to share.\n\nLittle backstory first: I (34) grew up overweight. Lost it in my late teenage years and my early adolescence years were at a normal weight. But everything crashed down in 2020. My mental issues escalated which lead to a lot of weight gain. 2024 was a horrible year for me so I decided to turn it around in 2025. \n\nSo I started keto 2 months ago. This was actually because I kept seeing things about the mental benefits. I was sceptical at first, but I also have a background in metabolic engineering and immunology so I trusted myself in applying it correctly for my own genetics. Plus I had gone vegan at the end of 2024 but it felt like I overlooked the main cause of my issues. I decided to also cut out possible allergens. So on the 7th of February, my one meal a day vegan keto gluten free diet started at 132.2 kg. \n\nThe first days I noticed my brain fog was disappearing and started feeling pretty good. So good I needed to adjust to my new mind set. I am recently diagnosed with autism and before I made the diet change I would have argued that I may also have ADHD. However those traits are almost entirely gone and I am now very confident that I am only autistic. Also very important to mention is that due to the lack of allergens, I have confirmed that I am very susceptible to histamine. Eating baba ganoush (egg plant), drinking beer or smoking cannabis (yep, also contains histamines!) will trigger my immune system and gives me swelling and headaches. Probably I low key had this for years. \n\nIt gets even better, the improved mental state made me figure out the root cause of a problem my body had for the last 5 years. My pelvis was tilted (yippie to autistic hypermobility). Thanks to google and chatGPT, I untilted my pelvis and stood up straight for the first time since covid.\n\nAnd as the closer, after 2 months of this diet I lost 19.5 kg. I know this is really fast but I am not losing muscle mass and it feels like my body is returning back to its natural base line.\n\nThanks for reading!

{"title": "2.5 Month Update", "selftext": "I'm about two and a half months into my 2025 keto journey. Just to recap: I started at 265 pounds, my highest weight ever. This is heavy for me. I won't rehash my entire life story here \u2014 I've already offloaded most of that into personal audio journals \u2014 but growing up, I was always lean. The real weight gain began around age 20, after moving out and sliding into a cycle of drinking and partying. Though I kept the weight off for a few years, the groundwork for a bad lifestyle had already been laid. By 25, it had fully caught up to me. Add in a stressful job, shifting social circles, and unstable living situations, and the habits compounded. The result was a severely overweight body by my early 30s.\n\nA few reflections on life at 250 pounds and above. Having lived on both sides of the line\u2014healthy and obese\u2014I can say two things with certainty: (1) Being overweight is profoundly uncomfortable. Basic things, like putting on socks, feel like small battles. Existing becomes a sweaty, breathless endeavor. And (2) I never once forgot what it felt like to be healthy.\n\nThe first point is obvious. I struggle to believe anyone severely overweight is truly \"comfortable\" in their body, no matter what slogans we tell ourselves. You can love yourself, sure. But physical discomfort isn't something you can love away. And 250 pounds at six feet tall isn't even the extreme; I see people my height pushing 275 or 300 pounds. That cannot be a pleasant experience.\n\nThe second point \u2014 the memory of a healthy body \u2014 is the harder one. I was trapped in a body that felt foreign, but my mind never adjusted. I remain the first-person witness to an ongoing tension between my \"skinny mind\" and \"fat body.\" I'll use \"fat\" here not as a pejorative, but as a neutral descriptor\u2014a term that matches the reality of how I looked and felt. Some people feel differently about the word. I don't.\n\nThat's the primer. Now to the substance.\nI first tried keto from January to around October 2020. I started at about 250 pounds and dropped to 185 pounds\u2014without much exercise, while drinking alcohol, and eating plenty of \"dirty keto\" foods like burgers and bacon. Up close, it didn't look healthy. But from a distance\u2014month over month\u2014the results were clear. I lost weight steadily.\n\nEventually, though, I stopped keto without a plan. Between 2021 and late 2024, I put all the weight back on, and then some.\nWhat did I learn from round one? That I was far more comfortable living in a 185-pound body. That discipline matters. That keto worked, but it needed to be a longer-term commitment\u2014or at least have a real exit strategy. And so, four years later, here we are.\n\nBy 2025, I felt sick. Not myself. Every day, my weight confronted me\u2014not because I chose to focus on it, but because obesity makes itself impossible to ignore. I knew how to get into ketosis, so I did.\nI started again at 265 pounds. As of today, roughly 2.5 months in, I'm sitting around 235 pounds\u201430 pounds lighter. And this time, I'm locked in.\n\nMy approach remains \"dirty keto\": focus on low carbs and a caloric deficit, not on perfect food quality. I've been filling in gaps with supplements, plenty of water, electrolytes, and green drinks like AG1. I know I'll need to pivot to a cleaner version eventually\u2014and I plan to, once I approach 200 pounds. But for now, I'm drawing on advice a doctor gave me during my first keto round.\n\nBack then, I expressed concern about cholesterol and heart health. He said, \"Look\u2014you started at 250 pounds and now you're around 200. Any damage you did with the keto diet is far less than the damage you'd have done by staying obese.\" That framing still grounds me. It\u2019s better to lose the weight imperfectly than to remain trapped in an unhealthy body.\n\nSo that's my 2.5-month update. I hope it shows what's possible when keto is used properly. And to be clear, nothing here is professional advice\u2014I'm sharing my experience, not offering prescriptions. I spoke with my doctor before starting. We discussed medications like Contrave, GLP-1s like Ozempic, and even stimulant options. I trialed Contrave briefly. It didn't work. In the end, I chose keto, and my doctor supported it. He took baseline blood labs and scheduled a six-month follow-up to re-test.\n\nIf you're considering a major weight loss journey, talk to your doctor. Consider keto\u2014and consider that you may already know what you need to do, even if it\u2019s hard.\n\nI'll post another update when I hit 200 pounds. Maybe a final one when I reach 185 pounds\u2014my high school weight.\n\nCheers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jtmua8/25_month_update/", "created_utc": 1744036776.0, "score": 23, "author": "Final_Dissipate", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jtmua8/25_month_update/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

My health was great, I had energy, and actually liked how I looked.  When I went off Keto, I stayed low carb, and was very proud of myself for actually managing to keep the weight off for a few years after.\nThen Covid hit.\nI'm a Healthcare care worker, and a stress eater. And my shifts went from 7-hour days Mon to Friday, to 10 hour shifts for 2 weeks at a time.  Due to no one really knowing how infectious this was, our usual cafeteria closed, as did my ability to store my meals in the staff fridge, which reduced what I was able to eat at work.  I eventually ended up eating poorly as I'd use high-sugar foods to give me energy during my shifts, and long story short, I ended up regaining almost all my weight back.\n(I explained this so you'll know why I'm asking for a resource. I also take full responsibility for regaining, nothing is wrong with the diet, it clearly works IF you stick to it.)\nWhen I was last here, I thought there was a page or link to a page that gave a \"Starting Keto shopping list\" - a list of the things to buy you'll need to have on hand almost all the time. Keto \"staples\", more or less.  Either it's been removed, or my 51 yr old eyes are failing because I can't seem to find it here anywhere.\n\nI also have a question about butter/margarine.\n\nI know butter is clearly better for you, and in the information links this place provides, it explains how butter has more Omega than margarine, etc.  My question is, is margarine actually BAD for the Keto diet, or is it just that butter is better? Is margarine ok if you supplement with omega?  I ask because for some strange reason, I'm not fond of the taste of butter.  I am, however, fond of the Becel brand Avacado oil margarine.

{"title": "Keto, Cortisol, and a Teaspoon of Honey: A Surprising Sleep Hack", "selftext": "I came across some posts recently where people swore that taking a teaspoon of honey before bed helped stop them from waking up randomly in the night. At first, I dismissed it. I\u2019m one of those people who genuinely enjoys the keto lifestyle. I\u2019m strict about it, all the time. Keto has worked wonders for me, especially in clearing up life-long anxiety issues. So, naturally, I ruled out the honey trick because of its sugar content and the risk of getting kicked out of ketosis.\n\nBut then I started to think more deeply about *why* it might work.\n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with a pretty severe case of the dawn phenomenon. That frustrating early-morning spike in blood glucose. My fasting morning glucose levels often hover around 7.0 mmol/L until around noon, even though my carb intake is consistently below 20g per day. It didn\u2019t make sense. I knew I wasn\u2019t insulin resistant anymore as keto fixed that. So why the elevated glucose?\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me: maybe the issue isn\u2019t carbs... maybe it\u2019s *cortisol*.\n\nHere\u2019s my theory: Cortisol naturally rises in the early morning hours (part of the body\u2019s circadian rhythm), and it stimulates gluconeogenesis\u2014the liver\u2019s production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. This is one reason people experience elevated blood glucose in the morning, even when fasting.\n\nI figured by taking a small amount of honey ; approx. 5 to 10g of sugar, it would cause a gentle rise in blood glucose, and trigger an insulin response. That insulin, in turn, might *blunt* the overnight cortisol spike. And if that cortisol surge is what was waking me up at 2 or 3 a.m. or contributing to high glucose upon waking, dampening it could mean deeper sleep and better metabolic readings by morning.\n\nSo, I tried it. Just one teaspoon of raw honey before bed.\n\nThe next morning, despite my skepticism, I was surprised. My glucose was down to 5.4 mmol/L. I hadn\u2019t woken up in the middle of the night. I actually slept straight through, which hasn't happened in a long time. Even more surprising was that my ketone levels were still at 1.0 mmol/L. I was still in ketosis.\n\nI tried it again the next night. Same results. Exact same numbers. Obviously coincidental as this is not a precise game- but really pleasing.\n\nWhat I thought was just an old wives' tale turns out to have some very real metabolic mechanics behind it. Of course, this might not work for everyone. Some people are more sensitive to carbs, and some may find that even a small amount of sugar knocks them out of ketosis. But for me, eating strictly low-carb all day seems to have given my body enough metabolic flexibility to tolerate this micro-dose of honey without derailing my progress.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep experimenting, but so far? I\u2019m seriously impressed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jpr4wm/keto_cortisol_and_a_teaspoon_of_honey_a/", "created_utc": 1743607014.0, "score": 393, "author": "houvandoos", "num_comments": 119, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jpr4wm/keto_cortisol_and_a_teaspoon_of_honey_a/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Keto for non-fat guys", "selftext": "Hi \n\nI am 24y old, male. I've always been fit but I found out about keto and it seemed to be a much better diet than the one I was having \u2014 high-carb \u2014 so I decide to try keto.\n\nMy experience was somewhat disastrous. I went into keto without no problem for 10 days.  \nAt 10th day I had a keto flu but I couldn't understood because I was in keto for 10 days \u2014 how haven't I had the flu before? Something must have been wrong.\n\nThe symptoms I had was irregular heart beat and I was feeling nervous, which for me was something new in my entire life. And the irregular heart beat really scared me. I went to the hospital. When I got there they didn't care much, they thought it was anxiety and simply prescribed some anxiety pills.\n\nOnly then I found out about the electrolyte imbalance. I urinated a lot that night and only got better after drinking some electrolytes.\n\nBut the following weeks were a mess. I was getting anxiety all the time \u2014 and I couldn't understand it because I never had it for my entire life. I got carbs back, and I started feeling less anxious. I started to understand the anxiety was related to the food I was taking.  \n  \nEvery time I tried to cut back on carbs and get into keto again the anxiety increased. I even started to wake up at night with numb arms and lost the sleep entirely for a few days, which got me to the hospital again, to again be prescribed with anxiolytics.  \n\nNow I understanding that all these symptoms seem related with two things: electrolyte imbalance for sure, and potentially not enough calories.\n\nSolving the electrolyte imbalance is easy.\n\nBut when it comes to calories I find it very hard to get to 1800 kcals under keto.\n\nI've searched a few meal plans and they almost always stay under 1500 kcals, which isn't enough for me.\n\nI am 170cm and I went from 63 kg to 58 kg in 2 months and I haven't really been on keto for a 1/4 of it (as I always tend to get back to carbs to get more calories from time to time). (58 kg might not sound too little, but I (still) am muscular, so I am simply very short of body fat.)\n\nThe problem I tend to find is that I can't eat the 150g of fat that I supposedly need, unless I am eating whole slices of butter, which honestly doesn't feel healthy at all, much less tasty.\n\nI do like olive oil and butter, but on a normal amount. I am also not going to eat 50g or more of nuts everyday.\n\nSo my question is, how can one do keto without calorie deficit (e.g. 3 meals of >600 kcals per day) while sticking with a diet that is based as much as possible on unprocessed food, including olive oil and butter (which while only mechanically processed, are nonetheless processed and it doesn't feel natural to eat a bunch of it everyday)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jpr2pr/keto_for_nonfat_guys/", "created_utc": 1743606861.0, "score": 0, "author": "LocationConscious599", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jpr2pr/keto_for_nonfat_guys/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I was so happy bc it's been so long that I've been the below 200! However my weight has been fluctuating between 206 - 211 lbs for the past 6 months, but 4 months ago I brought it down to 199 lbs. Reason I was able to do that was because I was doing intermediate fasting for 23 hours and had a 1 hour period to eat, I was eating decently (was not on keto yet) and I managed to loose 8 pounds from 207 to 199lbs and did cardio burning up to 1000 calories a day, but I felt super depressed because how super strict I have to be with myself limiting myself so much I couldn't really enjoy eating periodically throughout the like a more healthier window period of intermittent fasting ex 16:8. So I tried that instead and ended up gaining the weight back to my fluctuating weights again! Would I have to do this again or can their be a more healthier option to do this. Back in 2020, I did keto, that time I weighed 232 and was able to bring down my weight to 201 lb by doing dirty keto (meats and high fats, no veggies) lost 31 pounds in 3 months, I was eating throughout the day, didn't even know much about fasting that time, but still manage to burn the weight off, I'm going back on keto again and plan to see if I can break out of this plateau officially so I can see the weight fall, I also been measuring myself and have been seen the same measurements.

My body seems Happy that way. \n\n- Texture solution: I was going mad without dry-crunch, but my saving grace has been psyllium husk toast, and cauliflower wraps made crispy in the air fryer!

This study demonstrates that brain aging follows a specific progression, with the first stage occurring in middle age and coinciding with increased insulin resistance. Moreover, we show that brain areas that age fastest are also those most vulnerable to neuronal insulin resistance. Importantly, we find that administering ketones, which can fuel neurons while bypassing insulin resistance, reverses brain aging effects. However, this intervention is only effective when provided early enough for neurons to remain viable. These findings contribute to our understanding of brain aging mechanisms and suggest neurometabolic strategies for targeted early intervention in preventing age-related cognitive decline.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jn2bil/thoughts_on_new_study_revealing_cognitive/", "created_utc": 1743300370.0, "score": 11, "author": "Bladerunner3039", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/1jn2bil/thoughts_on_new_study_revealing_cognitive/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Struggling to get into ketosis", "selftext": "Hello everyone about a month ago I was on a work trip and was eating carnivore all day and for desert I would have one of those keto pint ice cream bars. I wasn\u2019t thinking about keto, I wasn\u2019t tracking or counting anything, I was walking a lot every day and not eating about 7 hours in between lunch and dinner. I felt incredible like my mind was sharp and I wasn\u2019t hungry. I was having stressful dreams though. I felt like I was in ketosis but I\u2019m wondering if it was just my cortisol being high. I wasn\u2019t eating any carbs besides net carbs in that ice cream bars. I ate carbs when I got back home but after a few days I wanted to get back to that feeling I had on my work trip so I did research and realized I was probably in ketosis and that I wanted to get back into it. I started eating as much fat as I could, like trying to get to 200 grams but I\u2019d end up around 180. I wasn\u2019t having any carbs, basically eating the same way as I was on my work trip but more fat because I thought that\u2019s what I needed. I ended up eating around 2000-25000 calories a day. 2 weeks I didn\u2019t get into ketosis once and I gained weight. I am trying a different approach now where I\u2019m not trying to eat as much fat, but stay around 1800 calories. I\u2019m still around 20 carbs max, probably less because my fitness pal doesn\u2019t say net carbs. Only thing with carbs that I eat is a little whole milk in my coffee and that keto ice cream. It\u2019s been a week and today is the first day my keto meter says I\u2019m in a slight nutrional ketosis. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s taking so long or what I\u2019m doing wrong. Maybe if I\u2019m eating in a surplus of calories that my body can\u2019t get into ketosis? Yesterday was probably the least amount of food I had in a day all week and I had a lighter dinner than usual. And this morning is when I checked with my keto meter. I exercise every day with weights and walking. I\u2019m 31 female 127 lbs so I don\u2019t need to lose weight although I\u2019d like to lose a few pounds but I\u2019m more interested in the metal clarity and energy. Weight loss is a bonus. Last night was also the first time in weeks that I had a couple bites on fruit and sugar from a lemon cake. I\u2019m wondering how the heck today I could have my best readings after eating sugar and actual carbs for the first time last night.

I find it hard to eat the protein above 120 but I can dig up something. But the good fats are tricky. Whatayathink?\n\nI will get some shake and creatine. I have a ton of electrolytes stuff.

{"title": "Low protein in Keto Chow", "selftext": "I love the simplicity of mixing up a bunch of flavors of keto chow to keep in the fridge so I don't have to think about macros or electrolytes, because life is hard and cooking in our new apartment and its tiny kitchen (with very sensitive smoke detectors) makes my go-to of air frying a frozen steak more difficult then I am currently willing to deal with. \n\nWhat concerns me is that it's relatively low protein. For three shakes a day I'm getting 80 g of protein. If I want higher protein and have a fourth shake, I'm overdoing electrolytes. \n\nTo be fair, most of the research I did was when I started keto several years ago. What I read at the time and found success with was higher protein (~120g) with lower fat (~80g) since I am sedentary and carrying around about 40% body fat, so why eat extra fat when it can just be slurped up by my body's metabolic processes? When I started keto several years ago I lost just over 100 lb in a year eating this way with no exercise. \n\nI've cut the fat in my shakes and substituted some of it with peanut butter to add extra protein. I also make my own carnivore snax using thin sliced New York strip and a really nice dehydrator, so while that is an option it's an expensive one, even doing it myself. And I would also love to not have to supplement with other food. \n\nAt this point I'm kind of questioning everything: did I do it wrong the first time? Am I doing it wrong this time? Can I get away with long-term lower protein and higher fat and still lose weight at a decent rate? Will I have to experiment and find out?

{"title": "Keto/Carnivore for mental health - my experience/journey", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm making this post to maybe help some of you out there and share what worked and didn't work for me so if you wanna know how keto/carnivore affected my mental health (OCD, depression, agoraphobia) then keep reading. \n\nI started Keto around 2 years ago and that's how it went:\n\nSo with these 3 disorders above you basically do anything to get better and after literally trying every pill on the market and failed therapy sessions something else needed to be tried out. So I started eating under 20g carbs a day and tried to do it as healthy as possible, I usually ate salad, some kind of meat/fish and, avocados, a lot of eggs and other low carb food and stayed always under the 20g. So I did that basically 1,5 years and here are the advantages and disadvantges:\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\\- Depression was pretty much gone (around 90% better)\n\n\\- OCD was more bareable threw more stable mood (maybe 20% better)\n\n\\- Agoraphobia no change at all (0% sadge)\n\n\\- More Energy and no food coma\n\n  \nDisadvantages:\n\n\\- Always stressing out about what to eat \n\n\\- Keto flu is real so it took me about a month to adjust\n\n\\- Have to google nutrients all day and learn a lot about electrolytes (chatGPT is a live saver)\n\n\\- Your social life gets harder by a lot\n\n\\- More expensive in general\n\n\\- Much more preparation that stresses you out a lot\n\n\\- Really miss my brownies and sweets, you don't crave them but the thought of them is still nice\n\n\n\nSo after that I was pretty happy about the progress but sad my agoraphobia wasn't better and OCD still there so I decided for half a year to go all in and go carnivore after watching some YT videos telling me how bad plants are. I basically only ate butter, meat, eggs, salt and sometimes fish and drank only water so no cheating. So here are the results after 6 months:\n\n  \nAdvantages (if you can call them that):\n\n\\- Still Stable mood (same with keto)\n\n\\- No cravings for food whatsoever, eating almost became a burden\n\n\\- Always feeling full, never hungry\n\n  \nDisadvantages:\n\n\\- Getting used to it is a pain in the ass\n\n\\- Always struggled with electrolytes and headaches\n\n\\- The thought of meat now makes me sick, I would rather eat anything else\n\n\\- So damn expensive\n\n\\- Sometimes big brain fog\n\n\\- Social life is almost impossible when it comes to going out to eat\n\n\\- Didn't do anything for my OCD/Agroaphobia\n\n  \nSo my Conclusion:\n\nIf you have depression or feel depressed, I would 100% go for keto. It also gave me the energy to discipline myself so I also build quite a lot of muscles in these two years.\n\nIf you have anxiety disorders like OCD or Agoraphobia, I think you are better off just facing your fears and stop avoiding things that scare you, it helps a bit with stable mood but also has it limits. \n\nWhat also made quite a big difference is during this journey I also stopped smoking/vaping and quit caffeine which was a huge relief for the OCD, for the agoraphobia not so much (I guess we just gotta go out there). \n\nUnfortunately it wasn't the magic I hoped for and now go and travel the world but at least it helped in some aspects of my life. I had pretty high hopes in carnivore but that definetly didn't work for me.\n\nHope that helps somebody out there or at least saves them time or make a decision.
