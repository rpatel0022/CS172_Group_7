{"title": "(Update) I left my Job to Open a Pizza Shop", "selftext": "Hi everyone! Earlier this year I made a post about leaving my job to start a pizza shop. I was surprised by how well received it was, so I figured I\u2019d post the elusive 6+ month follow up to starting a new pizza shop. Also, AMA about pizza making, running a pizza shop, business, whatever. I\u2019ll do my best to answer as many as I can.\n\nOriginal post is here for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/13aymcj/rolled_the_dice_quit_my_stable_office_job_in_data/\n\n\nBusiness has been rough starting out. I think I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could make the best pizzas possible - but not enough time thinking about how people would find a pizza shop with no signage in a shared kitchen. Initially my plan was to rely on delivery apps like Doordash - but the whole ecosystem is kind of a nightmare. When I heard they took 30% I though \u2018Damn, that\u2019s going to make it hard\u2019. But that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. If you want any real visibility, you have to do offers or bid for paid spots. My take home when I was really invested in that whole ecosystem was about $45 out of every $100 in pretax sales. They\u2019ll present the numbers to you in ways that if your not mathematically literate, it\u2019ll look better than it is. For instance - spending $5 to get a $50 sale is shown as 10x ROI. Not like\u2026 you were making 30% max on that $50, then they took 30% and now your selling inventory at a loss with the $5 ad spend. Same deal with running specials - you can always up charge on the apps, but it hurts visibility. \n\n\nAnyway - I\u2019ve shifted my focus to more direct sales. I figure that\u2019s best for me and my customers. But it\u2019s hard with the location since we don\u2019t have/can\u2019t get any signage as it\u2019s a shared kitchen. I\u2019ve had some luck with social media advertising, but that\u2019s about the only place I\u2019ve seen any sort of ROI. Overall I\u2019m still running at a loss at business is pretty slow. \n\n\nBut I\u2019m at least glad I\u2019m taking a shot at something I always wanted to do. I\u2019d really *really* discourage anyone from taking a decision like this lightly- it\u2019s been some of the hardest times of my life for sure. But anyway - there\u2019s no bonus points for having an easy life, I\u2019m proud of the work I\u2019m doing and we\u2019ll see how much longer I can keep it up.\n\nThe shop is High Stakes Pizza in Mesa, Arizona.

This was at Una Pizza Napoletana in NYC so here\u2019s my thoughts!\n\nOverall, I\u2019d give it a 4.5/5, and it only loses points from the value which I\u2019ll get in to. \n\nMy pizza was the Margherita that I added pepperoni and hot peppers to and my wife got the Filetti. \n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nCrust: 5/5. Very soft, very fluffy and very\u2026there?  There\u2019s no denying it\u2019s a crust forward pizza which is obvious from the photo, but it\u2019s about 20% of the pizza.  Probably the 2nd best crust I\u2019ve ever had, second only to Piccolo Buco in Rome which this crust is almost identical to. \n\nSauce: 4/5. Nothing special but the tomatoes do seem really fresh and high quality. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any spices or seasonings in it at all so it is very basic but very good. \n\nToppings: 4/5. It only comes with basil, and the only options are pepperoni, hot peppers, Parmesan, and anchovies.  While the pepperoni and hot peppers were really good, it comes with a major caveat that I\u2019ll get in to on the next point which is\n\nValue: 3/5. This is the only place I\u2019ve ever been to that is ranked #1 in the world at anything, which can be hard to assign a value to but my pizza alone was $38 for a personal sized pizza. And it loses points because each topping is $6, so I paid $6 for I think 4 pieces of pepperoni. I know it isn\u2019t NY style that\u2019d come with 2 dozen pepperoni on it, but for $6 I\u2019d either expect more or for it to be much cheaper.  All in all we walked out at about $120 for two pizzas, a burrata and two desserts.\n\nService: 5/5. No complaints really, although we could barely hear our waiter. Pizzas came out about 20mins or so after we ordered\n\nAmbiance: 4/5. Cutely decorated for Christmas but the interior is pretty modern vs I was expecting something a bit more cozy and rustic.  \n\nI dunno if my individual ratings average out to an overall 4.5 but that\u2019s still where I\u2019d put it. It\u2019s up there for the best pizza I\u2019ve had. And the owner makes each dough, pizza and dessert himself every day (they\u2019re only open 3 days a week).

{"title": "Pizza ovens aren\u2019t for everyone, even most home pizza chefs", "selftext": "tl;dr - A standard home oven is all that most home pizza chefs need\n\nI\u2019ve had an Ooni for years and I love it. I use it every week. I\u2019ve been perfecting my technique and dough recipe and I love being able to host pizza parties and crank out a bunch of pizzas for my guests.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve seen a ton of people lately who are buying pizza ovens when they really shouldn\u2019t. One friend of mine laughed at the idea of making his own dough and just intends to use it with frozen pizzas.\n\nMy point: the whole purpose of a pizza oven is to reach higher temperatures than a home oven can. Most home ovens can hit 550, so unless you are specifically wanting to make Neapolitan pizza, you do not need a dedicated pizza oven. You will be much better served by a pizza steel and/or good quality pans (like Lloyd pans for Detroit style). New York style, Detroit style, Chicago tavern style, St. Louis style, Chicago deep dish\u2026 virtually every type of pizza except Neapolitan can be done in a normal oven, and not only that, is better in a normal oven! I see Ooni showing off how to do Detroit style in an Ooni, but it really doesn\u2019t make any sense to even try. You have more hot spots and temperature fluctuation whereas a normal oven can maintain a consistent temperature better.\n\nSo again, getting the most out of a dedicated pizza oven takes a lot of time and tinkering and should only be undertaken by people who want to make their own dough and make Neapolitan style pizzas.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ww4q4vs54l7d1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1718827341.0, "score": 1629, "author": "scottzee", "num_comments": 234, "permalink": "/r/Pizza/comments/1djsjup/pizza_ovens_arent_for_everyone_even_most_home/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Meatlovers Pizza (Sausage, beef, pepperoni)", "selftext": "Here is a quick rundown of what I did for this. Im making a meatlovers and a cheese pizza per my kids request, but put whatever toppings you want on this. Just prep your veggies and any meats that don't need precooked like pepperoni while your oven preheats. Everything else can be done the day before. With the food processor saving you kneading, all the prep can be done in under an hour.\n\nDough Recipe (Food Processor, Overnight Rise)\nIngredients:\n3 \u00bd cups (450g) bread flour\n1 \u00bd tsp (9g) fine sea salt\n1 tsp (4g) instant dry yeast\n1 \u00bc cups (300ml) lukewarm water (100\u2013110\u00b0F)\n1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil\nInstructions:\nCombine Dry Ingredients: In the food processor, pulse flour, salt, and yeast to combine (about 5 pulses).\n\nAdd Wet Ingredients: With the machine running, slowly pour in water and olive oil through the feed tube. Process until a shaggy dough forms and rides around on top of the blades, about 30\u201345 seconds. If too dry, add 1 tbsp water; if too wet, add 1 tbsp flour.\n\nKnead Briefly: Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 1 minute until smooth.\n\nDivide and Rest: Divide into two equal portions (mine were about 380g each). Shape into balls. Place each in a lightly oiled container or a ziploc bag. Refrigerate overnight or for a couple of days until youre ready to cook it.\n\nWarm Up: Remove dough from fridge 1\u20132 hours before shaping to reach room temperature.\n\nPizza Sauce\n\nIngredients:\n1 (28 oz) can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, drained (quality matters here)\n1 tbsp good quality olive oil\nkosher salt to taste\n2 tsp dried oregano\n3 clove garlic, minced\n1 tsp garlic powder\nPinch red pepper flakes (optional)\nPinch of sugar (if you must)\n\nInstructions:\nCrush tomatoes with your hand, potato masher, or food processor. (I prefer my hands for a coarser texture)\nMix with olive oil, salt, oregano, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Add a touch of sugar if you like a sweeter sauce. Though this should be unnecessary if you bought good quality tomatoes. Adjust seasoning to taste. Set aside (no cooking needed).\n\nAssembly and Baking\nEquipment:\nPizza stone or steel\n\nPizza peel or baking sheet\n\nOven preheated to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) or as hot as your oven will go with stone/steel inside for at least 45 minutes\nInstructions:\nShape Dough: On a floured surface, gently stretch one dough ball into a 12-inch circle, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust. Transfer to a floured peel or parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\nAdd Sauce: Spread \u00bd\u2013\u00be cup sauce evenly over dough, leaving a \u00bd-inch border. Its tempting, but dont overdo the sauce. \n\nAdd Cheese: Sprinkle 1 \u00bd cups mozzarella over sauce. Make sure you use FULL FAT LOW MOISTURE mozzarella.\n\nAdd Toppings: Evenly distribute half the ground beef, sausage, and pepperoni slices over cheese. Sprinkle with \u00bd tsp oregano. If making a meatlovers, or sprinkle with vegetables or whatever toppings you desire.\n\nBake: Slide pizza onto preheated stone/steel. Bake for 12\u201315 minutes, until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.\n\nFinish: Sprinkle with \u00bc cup Parmesan (if using). Let cool 2\u20133 minutes before slicing.\n\nRepeat: Repeat with second dough ball and remaining toppings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8x981", "created_utc": 1745734404.0, "score": 21, "author": "KegansKitchen", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Pizza/comments/1k8x981/meatlovers_pizza_sausage_beef_pepperoni/", "html_title": ""}

It was about an 870g dough ball for a 12x16 inch pan.\n\nThe base was parbaked with just sauce on top for 10 minutes at 280\u00b0C (536\u00b0F) on the bottom rack of the oven, with a 50/50 mix of mozzarella and raclette cheese added before baking for another 6 minutes at the top rack. I like the combination of mozzarella and provolone dolce too.\n\nThe base was airy and slightly chewy, with a little crunch to the crust.

It is a long time coming because this tiny Koda 12 is very finicky and requires a lot of additional steps so that the bottom and top can cook evenly all around. Every single ingredient minus the mozz is modeled after Sally's. The flour is also a tad different because I believe they use GM Full Strength but I couldn't find that where I am so I did the best I could with another high protein variant. The Stanislaus tomatoes, washed cheese, and Battistoni cupping pepperoni all were pretty spot on imo. Let me know if anyone has any questions as I am happy to answer them.

I had to add around a cup of flour (same as dough, King arthur special patent) to keep it from sticking to cutting board.  Then I could barely get it into a ball shape.  When I let my blob rest it basically turned into a puddle.  Let that rest for 30 mins.  I put the mishapen pizza on a heavily floured, mineral oil soaked, wooden peel and sent it into my brand new Ooni Koda 16, which had been on high for at least 15 mins.  The puddle came off the peel alright.  I tried to turn it due to charring after what seemed like 30 seconds but this was extremely difficult.  The closest side to me of the dough was barely cooked and the middle wasn't much better.  After being in for maybe 1:30 mins I took it out.  Burnt on top and the dough half cooked.  What are the things I did wrong and need to change so I can make beautiful pies like you legends.

{"title": "One of my favorites!", "selftext": "When I was a kid, my favorite toppings was cheese or pepperoni. I remember branching out when I first got to college. I would order a sausage pizza. Then, I tried sausage and green pepper. My mother was pretty finicky and had a penchant for salami. So, this was outside my comfort zone. Then in my sophomore year of school, I transferred to a school back home. I found this place just south of campus called Mama's Pizza. And I would get this small personal sized pizza and load it with four toppings. Pepperoni, sausage, green pepper and mushrooms. It was soooo good. \n\nFast forward to Saturday, I made my attempt at this combination, albeit with Italian sausage. I finely diced the bell pepper just as I remembered. It wasn't the same. I didn't use sweet sausage and my sauce wasn't as sweet (I use fresh garlic).  Not my first time with San marzano tomatoes, but the first time using Cento brand. \n\nI had planned on prepping the sausage on Friday evening, but I didn't get off work till 9:00 and I was super tired. So, I had to do it before I started the pizza process. It's a lot of work. I'm only partially cooking the sausage. I wanted to finish up on the pizza and not be overcooked. I also want to vacuum seal and freeze the remainder for future pies. \n\nI did a 9 minute bake this time. The last two and a half at high broil. I did extra sauce, extra cheese and four toppings. I knew I would have to cook it a little longer due to all that. I tried something different this time. I took a fork and docked the topping area to see if I could minimize the bubbles in that area of the pizza. I think there's one bubble that came through in the center area. I don't mind that. I just didn't want an overabundance in the middle of the pizza.

The only real problem I have had is if gluten development is poor and I let a thin spot in the crust go, it'll stick, but that's not very hard to control for. \n\nScreens are easy to manage, light, can be stored vertically, etc. Cleaning is one objective annoyance, but it's not the end of the world. Anyone can rotate or pull pizzas on screens, no special skill needed, I'm really confused why they get so little love here. \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/x9s237h6svve1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745107372.0, "score": 127, "author": "Humble_Ladder", "num_comments": 113, "permalink": "/r/Pizza/comments/1k39xh4/why_dont_pizza_screens_get_more_love_around_here/", "html_title": ""}

Please do not wait over 30 minutes for a table, make an easy reservation in advance.\n\nRegarding the pizza, it was great. I ordered half Supreme for my friend (some arugula + balsamic vinaigrette) and half Tie-Dye for me. I can see why people always order it. The crust is indeed as crispy as everyone says, like a cracker at first bite, but the chewiness of good NY pizza after. However, the sauce is what makes it great. The marinara + vodka combination is good, but the pesto sauce is amazing. Its acidic, unique flavor contrasts everything else so perfectly. \n\nIn terms of ranking it, however, it's a little difficult. The pizza is really unique compared to the others, so it's hard to compare to the other shops. I can only say that you should go and try it yourself. \n\nI've heard that Joe & Pat's is also good, I will go one day. The price at Rubirosa is slightly lower though, surprisingly.

Despite it being sketchy as hell, we went to L\u2019Antica Pizzeria da Michele, the seemingly oldest and most OG pizza joint. They sell two kinds of pizza- margherita and marinara. Got the margherita. Feels a little sacrilegious to criticize at all but here\u2019s the review. The good: amazing super chewy dough. Like elastic. Hydration must be off the charts. Super relaxed. Sauce seemed like raw high quality tomato. No frills. Sweet. The cheese was melty delicious mozzarella. Very high quality. The bad: I couldn\u2019t eat it at a table with a fork and knife. I had to take away and it is impossible to eat with just your hands. The center is so thin and soggy that it falls apart. The crust is spotted with char but cheese and bottom can use another 20-30 seconds in the wood fired oven. Had to sort of roll it on itself to eat the center. So, amazing flavor but challenging form. Glad I went. I\u2019d recommend going. The wait for a table might be worth it so you can fork and knife it. There is a second location right across the street which may be easier because it\u2019s less authentic? Maybe because it\u2019s not the original oven? Not sure. All the pizzas looked the same.

I wish I had done a 48 hour CF, but I kind of put off making this until the last minute, and didn't have a ton of time to let it ferment as long as I would have liked.\n\nI let it come up to room temp for about 2.5 hours before baking. I don't have a peel large enough for this sized pizza, so I stretched it out and put it on a screen, topped it, and brought it out to the oven. I put it into my Ooni Koda 2 Max which was reading around 640F at launch, then turned off the flames and let it bake for 4 minutes, rotating it 1/4 turn every minute. Once that was done and the base was set I pulled out the screen and let the pizza bake directly on the stone. I turned the left flame back on to a medium-low for the last 3 1/2 minutes, making this a 7 1/2 minute bake. One of the sides got a little dark on top, but the bottom crust was perfect.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyq3mu", "created_utc": 1744603481.0, "score": 213, "author": "general_motar", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/Pizza/comments/1jyq3mu/20_inch_in_the_ooni_koda_2_max/", "html_title": ""}

Hope you enjoy.\n\nINGREDIENTS\r\nFor the naan:\r\n1/2 cup warm whole milk (100 to 110\u00baF) (the milk makes for fluffier naan, replace with water if you have dietary restrictions)\r\n1/4 cup warm water (100 to 110\u00baF)\r\n2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast\r\n1 teaspoon packed dark or light brown sugar\nNote: I often sub in some honey from our brees, because health, if you want to use honey, adjust sugar to 1/2 tsp and add 3/4 tsp of honey.\r\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for\r\ndusting\r\n1 tablespoon canola oil or melted ghee, plus\r\nmore for brushing (I use Avocado oil)\r\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\r\nCooking spray (I have a 14\" non-stick ceramic skillet so don't use spray)\r\nCoarsely chopped fresh cilantro, for\r\nsprinkling (optional)\n\r\nFor the garlic butter: (optional)\r\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\r\n2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh\r\ncilantro leaves\r\n3 cloves garlic cloves, minced\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\nMake the naan:\r\n1. Whisk 1/2 cup warm whole milk, 1/4 cup warm water, 2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast, and 1 teaspoon packed brown sugar together in a medium bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit until the mixture is bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n2. Uncover (reserve the plastic wrap) and add 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon canola oil, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Stir until a dough ball forms.\r\n3. Transfer the dough ball onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Coat a large bowl with cooking spray. Pace the dough in the bowl. Cover with the plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.\r\n4. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 8 portions (about 2.75 ounces each). Shape each portion into a ball. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make the garlic butter if using. Heat a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.\r\n5. Roll out each dough ball into a 7-inch round about 1/4-inch thick. If you don\u2019t have room for them to sit in a single layer, sprinkle each one lightly with flour to prevent sticking and stack them, cooking the remaining naan rounds, brushing the skillet with more oil before each naan. (Cook like you are making pancakes. I have my largest gas burner set at 6-7 ish)\n\r\nMake the garlic butter:\r\n1. Melt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. \n2. Stir in 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and 3 minced garlic cloves. \n3. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

{"title": "What do Italians think of Argentine pizza?", "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nPlease, first of all, I\u2019d like to point out that I wouldn\u2019t want this post to turn into a series of offensive or disrespectful comments. I\u2019m just looking for some opinions from locals.\n\nThe thing is, years ago I lived in Rome for an extended period, and I loved Italian food. Later, I traveled throughout Italy and continued to adore it. For work reasons, I moved to Buenos Aires a couple of years ago, hoping to once again enjoy delicious Italian food or at least some variation of it. However, I find the food here quite disappointing.\n\nI mean, Argentinians are very proud of their pizza, gnocchi, and pasta, but when I try them, it honestly feels like Italian food is on a whole different level. For example, the pizza here is very thick and greasy. I even went to some specialized restaurants offering Neapolitan pizza, but I still wasn\u2019t fully convinced. I\u2019ve also bought gnocchi from many\u00a0*pastificios*\u00a0(pasta shops) in Buenos Aires, but I don\u2019t find them any better than those in Italian supermarkets\u2014miles away from the homemade ones there.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to know is how, in a country with so much Italian immigration in its origins, there is such a big difference in the cuisine compared to Italy.\n\nIn short: what do Italians think of the Italian food made in Argentina? Should I give it another chance?

{"title": "Meatlovers Pizza (Sausage, beef, pepperoni)", "selftext": "Here is a quick rundown of what I did for this. Im making a meatlovers and a cheese pizza per my kids request, but put whatever toppings you want on this. Just prep your veggies and any meats that don't need precooked like pepperoni while your oven preheats. Everything else can be done the day before. With the food processor saving you kneading, all the prep can be done in under an hour.\n\nDough Recipe (Food Processor, Overnight Rise)\nIngredients:\n3 \u00bd cups (450g) bread flour\n1 \u00bd tsp (9g) fine sea salt\n1 tsp (4g) instant dry yeast\n1 \u00bc cups (300ml) lukewarm water (100\u2013110\u00b0F)\n1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil\nInstructions:\nCombine Dry Ingredients: In the food processor, pulse flour, salt, and yeast to combine (about 5 pulses).\n\nAdd Wet Ingredients: With the machine running, slowly pour in water and olive oil through the feed tube. Process until a shaggy dough forms and rides around on top of the blades, about 30\u201345 seconds. If too dry, add 1 tbsp water; if too wet, add 1 tbsp flour.\n\nKnead Briefly: Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 1 minute until smooth.\n\nDivide and Rest: Divide into two equal portions (mine were about 380g each). Shape into balls. Place each in a lightly oiled container or a ziploc bag. Refrigerate overnight or for a couple of days until youre ready to cook it.\n\nWarm Up: Remove dough from fridge 1\u20132 hours before shaping to reach room temperature.\n\nPizza Sauce\n\nIngredients:\n1 (28 oz) can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, drained (quality matters here)\n1 tbsp good quality olive oil\nkosher salt to taste\n2 tsp dried oregano\n3 clove garlic, minced\n1 tsp garlic powder\nPinch red pepper flakes (optional)\nPinch of sugar (if you must)\n\nInstructions:\nCrush tomatoes with your hand, potato masher, or food processor. (I prefer my hands for a coarser texture)\nMix with olive oil, salt, oregano, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Add a touch of sugar if you like a sweeter sauce. Though this should be unnecessary if you bought good quality tomatoes. Adjust seasoning to taste. Set aside (no cooking needed).\n\nAssembly and Baking\nEquipment:\nPizza stone or steel\n\nPizza peel or baking sheet\n\nOven preheated to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) or as hot as your oven will go with stone/steel inside for at least 45 minutes\nInstructions:\nShape Dough: On a floured surface, gently stretch one dough ball into a 12-inch circle, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust. Transfer to a floured peel or parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\nAdd Sauce: Spread \u00bd\u2013\u00be cup sauce evenly over dough, leaving a \u00bd-inch border. Its tempting, but dont overdo the sauce. \n\nAdd Cheese: Sprinkle 1 \u00bd cups mozzarella over sauce. Make sure you use FULL FAT LOW MOISTURE mozzarella.\n\nAdd Toppings: Evenly distribute half the ground beef, sausage, and pepperoni slices over cheese. Sprinkle with \u00bd tsp oregano. If making a meatlovers, or sprinkle with vegetables or whatever toppings you desire.\n\nBake: Slide pizza onto preheated stone/steel. Bake for 12\u201315 minutes, until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.\n\nFinish: Sprinkle with \u00bc cup Parmesan (if using). Let cool 2\u20133 minutes before slicing.\n\nRepeat: Repeat with second dough ball and remaining toppings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8x981", "created_utc": 1745734404.0, "score": 22, "author": "KegansKitchen", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Pizza/comments/1k8x981/meatlovers_pizza_sausage_beef_pepperoni/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Toppings were sliced white mushrooms and Boars Head pre-sliced pepperoni. \n\nDefinitely one of the best pizzas I\u2019ve made so far. I like how the generously oiled Lloyd pan helped the crust get really crispy along the rim. It was good fresh but possibly better reheated at 450 on a stone for a few minutes today. \n\nThings I would do differently next time:\n- less cheese\n- finish directly on steel out of the pan\n- maybe 1 minute longer bake \n\nIf you got this far thanks for reading!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8j6j2", "created_utc": 1745690735.0, "score": 36, "author": "jk_pens", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Pizza/comments/1k8j6j2/first_pizza_with_new_steel_and_lloyd_pan/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The flour is also a tad different because I believe they use GM Full Strength but I couldn't find that where I am so I did the best I could with another high protein variant. The Stanislaus tomatoes, washed cheese, and Battistoni cupping pepperoni all were pretty spot on imo. Let me know if anyone has any questions as I am happy to answer them.

I've used Solo dough, local pizzeria dough and my own.\n\nI have tried getting the oven super hot, 700 degrees with a stone around 600+ and I have tried with a lower stone temp of 450. I have tried 62% hydration dough and 67%. I have tried blind baking the dough in the kitchen oven at 550, its highest temp and I have tried raw.

I'm talking charcoal char. \n\nMy question is this, why is that happening? At 550, it doesn't happen in the kitchen oven. Even if I bake it there from A to Z. I can leave the stone in the kitchen oven for an hour at 550 and still the dough will not char to the stone like it will in the Solo. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong here?

{"title": "One of my favorites!", "selftext": "When I was a kid, my favorite toppings was cheese or pepperoni. I remember branching out when I first got to college. I would order a sausage pizza. Then, I tried sausage and green pepper. My mother was pretty finicky and had a penchant for salami. So, this was outside my comfort zone. Then in my sophomore year of school, I transferred to a school back home. I found this place just south of campus called Mama's Pizza. And I would get this small personal sized pizza and load it with four toppings. Pepperoni, sausage, green pepper and mushrooms. It was soooo good. \n\nFast forward to Saturday, I made my attempt at this combination, albeit with Italian sausage. I finely diced the bell pepper just as I remembered. It wasn't the same. I didn't use sweet sausage and my sauce wasn't as sweet (I use fresh garlic).  Not my first time with San marzano tomatoes, but the first time using Cento brand. \n\nI had planned on prepping the sausage on Friday evening, but I didn't get off work till 9:00 and I was super tired. So, I had to do it before I started the pizza process. It's a lot of work. I'm only partially cooking the sausage. I wanted to finish up on the pizza and not be overcooked. I also want to vacuum seal and freeze the remainder for future pies. \n\nI did a 9 minute bake this time. The last two and a half at high broil. I did extra sauce, extra cheese and four toppings. I knew I would have to cook it a little longer due to all that. I tried something different this time. I took a fork and docked the topping area to see if I could minimize the bubbles in that area of the pizza. I think there's one bubble that came through in the center area. I don't mind that. I just didn't want an overabundance in the middle of the pizza.

{"title": "Rubirosa NYC - Tie-Dye and Supreme Pizza", "selftext": "In the heart of Nolita, right next to Prince Street Pizza (walk to Scarr's or West Village instead), is Rubirosa. I had wanted to try it out for a while, but couldn't find the time to go. I thought it would be hard to make a reservation, but there were plenty available for all times. Please do not wait over 30 minutes for a table, make an easy reservation in advance.\n\nRegarding the pizza, it was great. I ordered half Supreme for my friend (some arugula + balsamic vinaigrette) and half Tie-Dye for me. I can see why people always order it. The crust is indeed as crispy as everyone says, like a cracker at first bite, but the chewiness of good NY pizza after. However, the sauce is what makes it great. The marinara + vodka combination is good, but the pesto sauce is amazing. Its acidic, unique flavor contrasts everything else so perfectly. \n\nIn terms of ranking it, however, it's a little difficult. The pizza is really unique compared to the others, so it's hard to compare to the other shops. I can only say that you should go and try it yourself. \n\nI've heard that Joe & Pat's is also good, I will go one day. The price at Rubirosa is slightly lower though, surprisingly.

Despite it being sketchy as hell, we went to L\u2019Antica Pizzeria da Michele, the seemingly oldest and most OG pizza joint. They sell two kinds of pizza- margherita and marinara. Got the margherita. Feels a little sacrilegious to criticize at all but here\u2019s the review. The good: amazing super chewy dough. Like elastic. Hydration must be off the charts. Super relaxed. Sauce seemed like raw high quality tomato. No frills. Sweet. The cheese was melty delicious mozzarella. Very high quality. The bad: I couldn\u2019t eat it at a table with a fork and knife. I had to take away and it is impossible to eat with just your hands. The center is so thin and soggy that it falls apart. The crust is spotted with char but cheese and bottom can use another 20-30 seconds in the wood fired oven. Had to sort of roll it on itself to eat the center. So, amazing flavor but challenging form. Glad I went. I\u2019d recommend going. The wait for a table might be worth it so you can fork and knife it. There is a second location right across the street which may be easier because it\u2019s less authentic? Maybe because it\u2019s not the original oven? Not sure. All the pizzas looked the same.

{"title": "Toppings on Homemade Garlic Naan", "selftext": "Mod said repost with recipe. Recipe below \ud83d\udc47 \n\nI originally got this from an online blog and edited it after trials. Hope you enjoy.\n\nINGREDIENTS\r\nFor the naan:\r\n1/2 cup warm whole milk (100 to 110\u00baF) (the milk makes for fluffier naan, replace with water if you have dietary restrictions)\r\n1/4 cup warm water (100 to 110\u00baF)\r\n2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast\r\n1 teaspoon packed dark or light brown sugar\nNote: I often sub in some honey from our brees, because health, if you want to use honey, adjust sugar to 1/2 tsp and add 3/4 tsp of honey.\r\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for\r\ndusting\r\n1 tablespoon canola oil or melted ghee, plus\r\nmore for brushing (I use Avocado oil)\r\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\r\nCooking spray (I have a 14\" non-stick ceramic skillet so don't use spray)\r\nCoarsely chopped fresh cilantro, for\r\nsprinkling (optional)\n\r\nFor the garlic butter: (optional)\r\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\r\n2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh\r\ncilantro leaves\r\n3 cloves garlic cloves, minced\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\nMake the naan:\r\n1. Whisk 1/2 cup warm whole milk, 1/4 cup warm water, 2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast, and 1 teaspoon packed brown sugar together in a medium bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit until the mixture is bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n2. Uncover (reserve the plastic wrap) and add 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon canola oil, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Stir until a dough ball forms.\r\n3. Transfer the dough ball onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Coat a large bowl with cooking spray. Pace the dough in the bowl. Cover with the plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.\r\n4. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 8 portions (about 2.75 ounces each). Shape each portion into a ball. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make the garlic butter if using.

{"title": "What do Italians think of Argentine pizza?", "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nPlease, first of all, I\u2019d like to point out that I wouldn\u2019t want this post to turn into a series of offensive or disrespectful comments. I\u2019m just looking for some opinions from locals.\n\nThe thing is, years ago I lived in Rome for an extended period, and I loved Italian food. Later, I traveled throughout Italy and continued to adore it. For work reasons, I moved to Buenos Aires a couple of years ago, hoping to once again enjoy delicious Italian food or at least some variation of it. However, I find the food here quite disappointing.\n\nI mean, Argentinians are very proud of their pizza, gnocchi, and pasta, but when I try them, it honestly feels like Italian food is on a whole different level. For example, the pizza here is very thick and greasy. I even went to some specialized restaurants offering Neapolitan pizza, but I still wasn\u2019t fully convinced. I\u2019ve also bought gnocchi from many\u00a0*pastificios*\u00a0(pasta shops) in Buenos Aires, but I don\u2019t find them any better than those in Italian supermarkets\u2014miles away from the homemade ones there.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to know is how, in a country with so much Italian immigration in its origins, there is such a big difference in the cuisine compared to Italy.\n\nIn short: what do Italians think of the Italian food made in Argentina? Should I give it another chance? Look at it with fresh eyes?\n\nThanks", "url": "https://i.redd.it/nhi65mrt5eue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744458214.0, "score": 140, "author": "Bestintor", "num_comments": 126, "permalink": "/r/Pizza/comments/1jxfehv/what_do_italians_think_of_argentine_pizza/", "html_title": ""}
