{"title": "39 meals prepped in 6 hours", "selftext": "So glad I found this subreddit! Here is my [Happy Freezer](https://imgur.com/a/akd3xfo)\n\nMy husband and I both get home late during the week and the last thing either of us want to do is cook dinner. So I put together a meal plan and cooked up 39 individual frozen meals. It took about 6 hours. I do still cook on the weekend because nachos can't really be frozen and there is nothing quite like a fresh grilled steak.\n\nFor dinners we use aluminum tins that could easily go right into the oven. I get 25 of them for $5. They make for an easy cleanup as they are recyclable after a quick rinse (we don't reuse containers, they go directly into recycling). I made:\n\n* 8 Lasagna Casseroles\n\n* 6 Shepherd's Pies\n\n* 6 Chicken Cordon Bleu Casseroles\n\n* 5 Chicken Enchilladas\n\nFor lunches, I prep in plastic containers that could go into the microwave at work. I didn't make a lot of lunch options this time as we still had some mushroom soup and potato/leek soup leftover. This time I made:\n\n* 8 turkey chilis\n\n* 6 corn soups\n\nI exclusively look for recipes that have a 'freezer' option. 'Taste Of Home' has a great list of 150 different recipes that include a 'freeze' option for starters. Everything I've made from their list has been fantastic and will definitely be made again. All the dinners I made this last week were on that list.\n\nNeither of us eat breakfast so we don't prep for that.\n\nWe just bought a chest freezer so I'm looking forward to stocking that bad boy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onceamonthcooking/comments/agpxb9/39_meals_prepped_in_6_hours/", "created_utc": 1547673434.0, "score": 19, "author": "PracticalEmployee", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/onceamonthcooking/comments/agpxb9/39_meals_prepped_in_6_hours/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "39 meals prepped in 6 hours", "selftext": "So glad I found this subreddit! Here is my [Happy Freezer](https://imgur.com/a/akd3xfo)\n\nMy husband and I both get home late during the week and the last thing either of us want to do is cook dinner. So I put together a meal plan and cooked up 39 individual frozen meals. It took about 6 hours. I do still cook on the weekend because nachos can't really be frozen and there is nothing quite like a fresh grilled steak.\n\nFor dinners we use aluminum tins that could easily go right into the oven. I get 25 of them for $5. They make for an easy cleanup as they are recyclable after a quick rinse (we don't reuse containers, they go directly into recycling). I made:\n\n* 8 Lasagna Casseroles\n\n* 6 Shepherd's Pies\n\n* 6 Chicken Cordon Bleu Casseroles\n\n* 5 Chicken Enchilladas\n\nFor lunches, I prep in plastic containers that could go into the microwave at work. I didn't make a lot of lunch options this time as we still had some mushroom soup and potato/leek soup leftover. This time I made:\n\n* 8 turkey chilis\n\n* 6 corn soups\n\nI exclusively look for recipes that have a 'freezer' option.

With that said, I have a few questions:\n\n* **1) What is the best way to store them?** I generally only eat out of glass, so plastic is a no go.\n\n* **2) What can I expect from flavor and texture changes?** I love the food I eat and it tastes fresh even on Thursday! If I miss a meal, Friday it tends to be \"okay\" but still serves it's need!\n\nAside from the two meals above, I would probably throw in a Pasta + Chicken meal in there occasionally but aside from that, my diet stays consistent.\n\nAny tips, advice or information is welcomed and appreciated!\n\nThanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onceamonthcooking/comments/5q78e4/help_thinking_about_switching_from_once_per_week/", "created_utc": 1485392081.0, "score": 5, "author": "aItalianStallion", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/onceamonthcooking/comments/5q78e4/help_thinking_about_switching_from_once_per_week/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I didn't make a lot of lunch options this time as we still had some mushroom soup and potato/leek soup leftover. This time I made:\n\n* 8 turkey chilis\n\n* 6 corn soups\n\nI exclusively look for recipes that have a 'freezer' option. 'Taste Of Home' has a great list of 150 different recipes that include a 'freeze' option for starters. Everything I've made from their list has been fantastic and will definitely be made again.

If I miss a meal, Friday it tends to be \"okay\" but still serves it's need!\n\nAside from the two meals above, I would probably throw in a Pasta + Chicken meal in there occasionally but aside from that, my diet stays consistent.\n\nAny tips, advice or information is welcomed and appreciated!\n\nThanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onceamonthcooking/comments/5q78e4/help_thinking_about_switching_from_once_per_week/", "created_utc": 1485392081.0, "score": 5, "author": "aItalianStallion", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/onceamonthcooking/comments/5q78e4/help_thinking_about_switching_from_once_per_week/", "html_title": ""}
