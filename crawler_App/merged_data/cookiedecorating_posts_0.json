Each post is filled to the brim with positive energy and the supportive community we\u2019ve built together has fostered a culture of joy that\u2019s worth fighting for. That\u2019s why I felt it was so important to make this update \u2014 to empower, to educate, and to use my tech skills to help out the community I\u2019m so passionate about. \n\nIn this post, you\u2019ll learn what steps you can take if your intellectual property is being used without your consent and what you can do to proactively protect your work going forward. If you have any resources to add, please include them in a comment below.\n\n#What To Do If Your Work Has Been Stolen\nIt\u2019s a real bummer to discover your content is being used without your consent but here\u2019s the good news \u2014 you don\u2019t just have to sit there and take it. As a creator, you have rights. First, let\u2019s talk about when your work, the intellectual property (IP),  receives copyright protection. \n\n**Copyright Protection Begins At The Moment Of Creation**\n\nAccording to the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html), \u201cYour work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\u201d Additionally, you do not have to file for copyright protection for your creations to be protected, only if you wish to file a lawsuit. \nSo, if your work is being infringed upon, **it\u2019s time to take action**. Below you\u2019ll find helpful tips and tricks for identifying, documenting, and reporting copyright infringement.\n\n **Gather Information**\n\n* Record URLs for any **infringing** content\n+ Record URLs for your **original** posts\n- Gather evidence to support that you are the author of the content. A word of caution: Provide only what you need and nothing more and **watermark any additional content** if it is to be included with your complaint.\n\n**Documenting** \n\nIt\u2019s important to thoroughly document the URLs (including the links to your own posts) from the step above. Take special care to capture identifying information about the website, such as the URL, usernames, and timestamps for publishing.\n\n**Filing a complaint (website)**\n\nSome spammy websites do not include contact information such as an About Page or a Contact Form so tools like [Hosting Checker](https://hostingchecker.com/) will help you identify the hosting company to report abuse (usually found in support documentation). Tip: Search Google for the website host\u2019s name + copyright infringement and you should find the right documentation.\n\n**Filing a complaint (social media)**\n\nIf your content appears on any of the following social media platforms without your consent, you can easily file a complaint with the documentation you gathered in the above step. Below are links to each platform\u2019s help documentation for your convenience. \n\n* [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/about/copyright/dmca-pin/)\n+ [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help)\n\n#Proactive Tips For Protecting Your IP\n**Apply a Watermark**\n\nTo better protect your images (and to inconvenience the infringer) consider applying a watermark. The most effective placement is in the dead center of an image with just enough visibility for it to appear clearly. It\u2019s not ideal, of course, but it might deter someone from publishing your content on their website.

When should I freeze in the process? Should I even freeze?\n\n\\---\n\nHi everyone!\n\nThis week was great. I had three cookie orders, and met the organizer of a popular market series who really loves my work. I feel awesome, and absolutely like garbage at the same time. Why you ask? Because of the **sleep deprivation!**\n\nI tend to do some higher detail and 3d shapes, and curated sets for my cookies (see my past posts!) and I know I need to let go of perfectionism. *BUT* I think people are noticing it, and I am hesitant to give up on what makes them special. I work at an office part time as well, so it is a bit spread out, but does my process look insane to you?\n\n**My Process**  \nDay 1 (and sometimes more if I mull it over) Cookie Design/Colour Palette Choices  \nDay 2 - Make dough, bake cookies, make icing, prep colours/bag consistency  \nDay 3 - Flood  \nDay 4 - Detail (Usually stay up WAY too late here)  \nDay 5 - Package/photograph on day of pickup\n\nI know that once I have designs for a market locked down that this should decrease the timing on certain things, but I wondered about prepping more ahead of time, especially having things ready for possible orders in-between.  \n  \n**Freezing**  \nCurrently I try to have frozen dough on hand, but freezing baked cookies beforehand seems like a good place to start when I get an order ahead of time.

{"title": "Making details with royal icing seems impossible - help!", "selftext": "Hi everybody,\n\n  \nI've started cookie decorating a few months ago and while I've improved, I keep running into the same issue. I find it really difficult to explain, so bear with me as I try.\n\n  \nEssentially, my royal icing is very sticky when I work with it. It dries fine in my dehydrator, and flooding and outlining goes perfectly. Where it goes 'wrong', however, is when I try to do any sort of detail. Even a dotted pattern seems to be almost impossible. My issue is that the royal icing, as it's super sticky, doesn't just allow for me to do blobs or dots or lines or basically anything. It doesn't matter if the consistency is super stiff or flooding, it just is impossible for me to 'stop' the icing when I want it to. I can pull as hard as I want, put less pressure, but after whatever I'm trying to do, a sliver of royal icing always follows. \n\nI follow a fairly standard recipe (4 cups of powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons merengue powder and water, amount depending on the consistency).  \n\n  \nNow, when I look at other peoples' videos, they seem to have no problem making dots, lines or any sort of detail. When they want the icing to stop, it just does. It doesn't matter what I do though, that's not how it works for me. \n\nI'm considering changing my royal icing recipe, perhaps egg whites would work better, but since that's going to be more expensive, I'm just really trying to figure out what I can do better. The other day I tried to make these sunflower cookies ([How to make Cute BUMBLE BEE & SUNFLOWER COOKIES - Piped sunflower technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ic_dfx2tFo&t=245s)) and the petals just ended up being like half an inch longer (spilling all over the edge and even touching the plate), just because I can't get the icing to stop where I want it to.\n\n  \nAny and all advice is super welcome...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1j3m6ni/making_details_with_royal_icing_seems_impossible/", "created_utc": 1741123921.0, "score": 1, "author": "bakingwithdemi", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1j3m6ni/making_details_with_royal_icing_seems_impossible/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Sugar cookie spread questions!", "selftext": "I've made the America's Test Kitchen Family Baking Book holiday cookie recipe for years, and just recently started learning about royal icing and decorating. The cookie recipe is DELICIOUS and so I really don't want to tweak it too much or switch, but recent batches I've made are spreading. Looking back at October when I made Halloween cookies there was no spread (pre decorating-hobby research). Here are some things I've tried/noticed...\n\n\\- The Halloween cookies that didn't spread were rolled pretty thin and overbaked. Recently I've been rolling with guides, a little thicker than 1/4\", and removing when the middle isn't shiny.\n\n\\- OG recipe calls for 375 degrees, I've also tried 325 and 350.\n\n\\- Spread on silpat seems worse than on parchment, but on parchment the edges seem more jagged (if that makes sense)? Haven't had too much of a problem with bubbles, nothing I can't iron out with a spatula.\n\n\\- The dough has been consistently cold/freezing. The timing/placement of the fridge/freezer has maybe changed but should this make a difference? My recipe calls for mixing the dough and placing two 4-inch discs in the fridge at least 20 min, rolling out/cutting, and then fridge again until firm before baking. Since reading about other recipes I've been rolling out to desired thickness and cooling before cutting out, then again to firm before baking. I don't think this should make a difference since everyone seems to use the fridge at different points but maybe it does...\n\n\\- My recipe doesn't have  eggs and has a small amount of cream cheese. Most all others do have eggs and cream cheese doesn't seem to be super common. But again, I've had crisp edges in the past so maybe this doesn't matter.\n\n\\- Yesterday I added 2 Tbsp cornstarch which seemed to make zero difference.\n\n\\- My butter is room temp but not cool, as recommended\n\nHere's the recipe: 2.5 c AP flour, 3/4 c superfine sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 sticks cool room temp unsalted butter, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 Tbsp cream cheese room temp\n\nSorry for the novel - thank you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1ie6w32/sugar_cookie_spread_questions/", "created_utc": 1738298123.0, "score": 1, "author": "alexandra-faye", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1ie6w32/sugar_cookie_spread_questions/", "html_title": ""}

I was really excited and now it's fast approaching and I'm getting really nervous!\n\nEvent background: They're expecting a boy and the theme is \"Our little explorer\" / travel in general. My brother is an aviation nerd so I'm also planning to making chocolate and vanilla \"cloud\" cupcakes with little teeny airplanes fixed on top. This is their third baby so the shower is going to be very lowkey and just close family. I'm sure my family will be happy with whatever I make, and they don't need to be perfect.\n\nMy background: I've been baking my whole life but I'm BRAND NEW to sugar cookie decorating. I've made one test batch and they were absolutely delicious, but the decorating itself, while fun to do, was abstract at best. I love following this subreddit, but I don't foresee my cookies for this event to be anywhere near as polished as the sets I usually see here. I focused on wet-on-wet designs in my test batch, and don't think I have the artistic capabilities let alone steady-enough hands to even begin to do any lettering. \n\n  \nThat being said.. I'm trying to plan out what I'm going to do so I can get to doing! I only have circle cookie cutters, so I was planning on every design being based on a circle shape to keep things simple in that regard.

{"title": "Giving a few decorating tips", "selftext": "I started my cookie decorating journey about six months ago. I am definitely not a natural in any way. Who knows how long I will stick with this hobby, but it\u2019s been fun and a great way to give a personalized gift.\n\nHere are a few tips that I have learned along the way: \n\n1. You will need to practice way more than you probably think. I used to buy bins of really cheap sugar cookies at the local grocery store\u2026there\u2019s nothing like practicing with real royal icing on a real cookie.\n\n2. Many of the gadgets are really not necessary, but totally fun. I ended up buying a mini projector on eBay. It makes a world of difference, especially if you want to do any lettering.\n\n3. Sometimes the prep work involve to getting to a set of cookies is overwhelming. I tend to do them in stages. Make the dough one night. Let it chill overnight. Make the icing the next morning. Make my separate colors and let them develop over overnight. One big tip is to make a huge amount of just plain white royal icing that you can then keep in the fridge. As you need different colors, just take a little bit of the royal icing and color it.\n\n4. The consistency of your royal icing is everything. You can read about the different consistencies all you want, but you just have to experiment. One big lesson I learned is not to overbeat the royal icing as it becomes kind of marshmallow like. Once it becomes marshmallow like, it\u2019s very hard to get smooth cookies.\n\n5. You probably do not need a dehydrator, I use two tiny mini fans that were like five dollars.\n\n6. Make sure to let your flooded cookies dry overnight, or at least several several hours. Do not worry about leaving them uncovered while they are drying. The royal icing acts as a barrier and the cookie stay fresh.\n\n7. It is inexpensive and nice to buy one of those heat sealers. Put your cookies in a clear bag and heat seal them. They will last a long time that way.\n\n8. Making black icing is tough. Start with a base of black cocoa powder royal icing. Google it if you need a recipe.\n\n9. Never ever use water based food coloring in your royal icing. Most of us use gel. Some people use powder, but I have not tried powder.\n\n10. This subreddit is the most supportive place to ask for help or give help. Such a nice little online community.\n\nThat\u2019s it! Would love it if others would share their lessons learned. Here\u2019s to more cookie making in 2025!

I'm staying up too late decorating. I need to streamline my timing with possible markets and weddings coming up. Curated sets take about 5 days from design to finish- is that really unexpected? When should I freeze in the process? Should I even freeze?\n\n\\---\n\nHi everyone!\n\nThis week was great. I had three cookie orders, and met the organizer of a popular market series who really loves my work. I feel awesome, and absolutely like garbage at the same time. Why you ask? Because of the **sleep deprivation!**\n\nI tend to do some higher detail and 3d shapes, and curated sets for my cookies (see my past posts!) and I know I need to let go of perfectionism. *BUT* I think people are noticing it, and I am hesitant to give up on what makes them special. I work at an office part time as well, so it is a bit spread out, but does my process look insane to you?\n\n**My Process**  \nDay 1 (and sometimes more if I mull it over) Cookie Design/Colour Palette Choices  \nDay 2 - Make dough, bake cookies, make icing, prep colours/bag consistency  \nDay 3 - Flood  \nDay 4 - Detail (Usually stay up WAY too late here)  \nDay 5 - Package/photograph on day of pickup\n\nI know that once I have designs for a market locked down that this should decrease the timing on certain things, but I wondered about prepping more ahead of time, especially having things ready for possible orders in-between.  \n  \n**Freezing**  \nCurrently I try to have frozen dough on hand, but freezing baked cookies beforehand seems like a good place to start when I get an order ahead of time. I am just really paranoid about when in the process they should freeze. Freeze after the bake, flood or detail? Should I even freeze for orders? There is a lot of different information out there!\n\nI'm sorry for the essay- I even have more questions but I will save those for a later post.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1jdgdxc/help_meeeee_i_keep_staying_up_way_too_late_to/", "created_utc": 1742227791.0, "score": 16, "author": "Ottershorts", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1jdgdxc/help_meeeee_i_keep_staying_up_way_too_late_to/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Making details with royal icing seems impossible - help!", "selftext": "Hi everybody,\n\n  \nI've started cookie decorating a few months ago and while I've improved, I keep running into the same issue. I find it really difficult to explain, so bear with me as I try.\n\n  \nEssentially, my royal icing is very sticky when I work with it. It dries fine in my dehydrator, and flooding and outlining goes perfectly. Where it goes 'wrong', however, is when I try to do any sort of detail. Even a dotted pattern seems to be almost impossible. My issue is that the royal icing, as it's super sticky, doesn't just allow for me to do blobs or dots or lines or basically anything. It doesn't matter if the consistency is super stiff or flooding, it just is impossible for me to 'stop' the icing when I want it to. I can pull as hard as I want, put less pressure, but after whatever I'm trying to do, a sliver of royal icing always follows. \n\nI follow a fairly standard recipe (4 cups of powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons merengue powder and water, amount depending on the consistency).  \n\n  \nNow, when I look at other peoples' videos, they seem to have no problem making dots, lines or any sort of detail. When they want the icing to stop, it just does. It doesn't matter what I do though, that's not how it works for me. \n\nI'm considering changing my royal icing recipe, perhaps egg whites would work better, but since that's going to be more expensive, I'm just really trying to figure out what I can do better. The other day I tried to make these sunflower cookies ([How to make Cute BUMBLE BEE & SUNFLOWER COOKIES - Piped sunflower technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ic_dfx2tFo&t=245s)) and the petals just ended up being like half an inch longer (spilling all over the edge and even touching the plate), just because I can't get the icing to stop where I want it to.\n\n  \nAny and all advice is super welcome...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1j3m6ni/making_details_with_royal_icing_seems_impossible/", "created_utc": 1741123921.0, "score": 1, "author": "bakingwithdemi", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1j3m6ni/making_details_with_royal_icing_seems_impossible/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sugar cookie spread questions!", "selftext": "I've made the America's Test Kitchen Family Baking Book holiday cookie recipe for years, and just recently started learning about royal icing and decorating. The cookie recipe is DELICIOUS and so I really don't want to tweak it too much or switch, but recent batches I've made are spreading. Looking back at October when I made Halloween cookies there was no spread (pre decorating-hobby research). Here are some things I've tried/noticed...\n\n\\- The Halloween cookies that didn't spread were rolled pretty thin and overbaked. Recently I've been rolling with guides, a little thicker than 1/4\", and removing when the middle isn't shiny.\n\n\\- OG recipe calls for 375 degrees, I've also tried 325 and 350.\n\n\\- Spread on silpat seems worse than on parchment, but on parchment the edges seem more jagged (if that makes sense)? Haven't had too much of a problem with bubbles, nothing I can't iron out with a spatula.\n\n\\- The dough has been consistently cold/freezing. The timing/placement of the fridge/freezer has maybe changed but should this make a difference? My recipe calls for mixing the dough and placing two 4-inch discs in the fridge at least 20 min, rolling out/cutting, and then fridge again until firm before baking. Since reading about other recipes I've been rolling out to desired thickness and cooling before cutting out, then again to firm before baking.

{"title": "Giving a few decorating tips", "selftext": "I started my cookie decorating journey about six months ago. I am definitely not a natural in any way. Who knows how long I will stick with this hobby, but it\u2019s been fun and a great way to give a personalized gift.\n\nHere are a few tips that I have learned along the way: \n\n1. You will need to practice way more than you probably think. I used to buy bins of really cheap sugar cookies at the local grocery store\u2026there\u2019s nothing like practicing with real royal icing on a real cookie.\n\n2. Many of the gadgets are really not necessary, but totally fun. I ended up buying a mini projector on eBay. It makes a world of difference, especially if you want to do any lettering.\n\n3. Sometimes the prep work involve to getting to a set of cookies is overwhelming. I tend to do them in stages. Make the dough one night. Let it chill overnight. Make the icing the next morning. Make my separate colors and let them develop over overnight. One big tip is to make a huge amount of just plain white royal icing that you can then keep in the fridge. As you need different colors, just take a little bit of the royal icing and color it.\n\n4. The consistency of your royal icing is everything. You can read about the different consistencies all you want, but you just have to experiment. One big lesson I learned is not to overbeat the royal icing as it becomes kind of marshmallow like. Once it becomes marshmallow like, it\u2019s very hard to get smooth cookies.\n\n5. You probably do not need a dehydrator, I use two tiny mini fans that were like five dollars.\n\n6. Make sure to let your flooded cookies dry overnight, or at least several several hours. Do not worry about leaving them uncovered while they are drying. The royal icing acts as a barrier and the cookie stay fresh.\n\n7. It is inexpensive and nice to buy one of those heat sealers. Put your cookies in a clear bag and heat seal them. They will last a long time that way.\n\n8. Making black icing is tough. Start with a base of black cocoa powder royal icing. Google it if you need a recipe.\n\n9. Never ever use water based food coloring in your royal icing. Most of us use gel. Some people use powder, but I have not tried powder.\n\n10. This subreddit is the most supportive place to ask for help or give help. Such a nice little online community.\n\nThat\u2019s it! Would love it if others would share their lessons learned.
