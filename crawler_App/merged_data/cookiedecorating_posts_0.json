Your husband is right, some people will think that they are too nice to eat. Next time, try breaking one in half and leaving a half cookie on the plate. It will make it easier for others to take one, seeing that someone else has already started eating them. (Taking a whole cookie does not let anyone know that they are being eaten.)

I told them that I hoped my cookies tasted as good as they looked, so EAT THEM!! That seemed to do the trick.\n\nThat being said, it might be a combo of reasons that have nothing to do with your cookies. Some folks might be gluten-free. Maybe some have had bad experiences with other decorated cookies (some can be real hard and not so tasty). It's possible that some folks thought these were store bought because they're super cute and very consistent - that's a testament to your decorating skills - so went for the more homemade looking stuff.\n\nDon't be disheartened. You did a fantastic job. Maybe stick these in the back of the freezer and nosh on them in a few months when you find them again. If you enjoyed the process, keep at it!", "My guess is honestly that people thought they were too cute. This is an idiotic reason while simultaneously being something I have done. I\u2019m really sorry your efforts feel unappreciated.", "Awwwe \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1f they are so wonderfully cute. I would\u2019ve ate all your cookies! Please keep decorating because you did a fabulous job!", "Last week my fianc\u00e9 made cookies for her holiday work party. She made her (in my opinion) absolute banger, 11/10 BEST cookie recipe; white chocolate sweet potato cake cookies. They are unbelievable, sweet and spiced, moist but firm, just truly top tier cookies. She also made some lime bars. They\u2019re great, but not life changing, nothing revolutionary. At the end of the night there was only 2 or 3 cookies gone (~15 people), but most of the lime bars were eaten. She was a little upset, but glad people liked the lime bars. I was devastated, I was more upset than she was. I didn\u2019t know if I could look them in the eye again, I would constantly be thinking about how poor their taste was. How could I trust anything they say if they didn\u2019t like this cookie? \n\nShe was off the next day and left the cookies in the break room. The day after that she worked, and when she came in people were RAVING. 5 or 6 people came up to her to express how amazing the cookies were. There was only a few left in the tin. After asking around a little we pieced together the story. Multiple people brought dinner foods, tacos, side dishes etc., and multiple people brought desserts. The dinner food was really good, and people filled up on it. Someone tried a lime bar, and then commented aloud how good it was. This led to multiple people trying the lime bar to confirm, and then being full, never got around to trying the cookies. The next day people were sampling everything they missed and the cookies were discovered. They were rightly found out for the amazing, life changing experiences they are. She had to print out multiple copies of the recipe to give out. At the end of the day, people VASTLY preferred the cookies. \n\nSo, moral of the story? Firstly, I am vindicated that the cookies truly are mana from heaven. But more importantly, and relevant to you, don\u2019t put too much stock into group dynamics. There\u2019s probably a dozen reasons they missed and didn\u2019t try your cookies, none of which you could control. I don\u2019t think it reflects on your work, which looks beautiful, or the taste, they weren\u2019t eaten so how could it! Bring them back to work and make some people try them, I\u2019m positive they\u2019ll love them.", "Awee I\u2019m sorry! They are so cute!

I would suspect that they were just so pretty that people were afraid to ruin such beautiful work\u2026 but they missed out on some tasty cookies!!", "I'm going to contribute a potentially unpopular opinion here, but it might shed light on your problem depending on the circumstances. I love the look of these types of cookies - it's why I follow this subreddit - but they're not my favorite thing to eat. Were there other options at this party? If there were, I would 100% be the person admiring your skill and hard work and then reaching for a regular chocolate chip cookie to eat. Chocolate, nuts, caramel, fruits - all of these flavors are going to look more appealing to me than a plain sugar cookie with some icing. And especially at Christmas when I KNOW I'm going to be overindulging in sweets, I'm probably not going to think the calories are worth it for this type of cookie. I'm sorry no one ate them though. That must have been hard when you worked so hard.", "Too pretty to eat! They don't look like cookies", "I agree with everyone on the too pretty part, but also, some people avoid sugary treats for reasons.

There\u2019s a lot going into orders before they\u2019re even started.  So we disagree about what she charges.  I\u2019m not greedy, but I do think she puts in a lot of time and effort into these cookies and shorts her self on what she charges.

Many things go into pricing, ingredients/packaging/time/overhead/marketing ect. Charge your worth, but that can also only go so far depending on what people are willing to pay in your area and the skill level. \n\nI suggest she look into the cake cost app. It's really helpful. You enter in all your related costs, and how much you want to pay yourself and it calculates the total cost for you. \n\nThat being said, these cookies take a loooot of time, and you're never going to get paid well per hour on them in my opinion. No one wants to pay a baker what they're truly worth. I was charging around $90-$110/dozen for mine at the highest, and I was still making minimum wage per hour BEFORE expenses. It's a high turnover business due to burnout and low pay, or usually just a side gig for most of my cookier friends. From my experience I'd say hers fall under the $50 range, but that's depending on your area. \n\nI do see you've said that she has to turn down orders. If you are turning people away, you need to up your prices! Find the sweet spot pricing that makes you just as busy as you'd like to be. Slowly increase prices and see what happens.", "To your wife:\n\nIf you\u2019re in the DC area you should be charging like $60 per dozen! Also, charge for delivery! I charge $15 to deliver 5 min away! Get paid for your time! \n\nI have a base price of $57 per dozen and that includes up to four designs per two dozen cookies. And the more complex the designs, the more I charge. Or if they want 10 designs on 24 cookies, upcharge. I\u2019m on the verge of making my minimum order 2dozen, because $57 for a days work isn\u2019t worth it. I live in the Portland Oregon area, and while it\u2019s decently affluent it\u2019s not a very showy town. There\u2019s way more \u201ckeeping up with the joneses\u201d vibes on the east coast or cities like Dallas and Houston. \n\n(I also post my base prices on my website. It reduces the amount of ghosted inquiries I get.)\n\nI understand being afraid to increase the prices. Bump it up $5 every month until you\u2019re at a better price. When I finally started charging more than $35 a dozen I actually felt better about my work, didn\u2019t feel as stressed, and wasn\u2019t spinning my wheels.\n\nAlso, find local fellow cookiers; cottage biz, domestic license, small shops whoever! Even local commercial bakeries. Building that network to refer customers around, borrow supplies/equipment, advocating for more small biz laws/bills\u2026 even just an occasional meetup to whine about the price of butter and how much your hands hurt! \ud83d\ude05 Being on the same page about pricing with your local community will also help you from undercutting each other/not getting paid as much as you could!

The more you practice making icing, the easier it will become to control the consistency! For cookies of that size, lots of cookiers just mix one intermediate consistency, sort of a thick flood, and use that both to pipe and to fill in.", "I love them and I\u2019ve decided they should all be named Harold.", "They are adorable", "I think they look good, especially the one on the left with all the dots!", "Dude, they're a work of conceptual art.\n\nThe rough edges and imperfection of the flooding express the fragility of life in the Mesozoic era.\n\nThe abstract form is a reflection of our anthropocentricity and resultant inability to understand life outside of our own lived experience.\n\nEvery imperfection here has an intentional meaning.\n\nThis was always your intention, right? ;p\n\nThese are the most thought-inspiring cookies I've ever seen!\n\nIf anyone throws you any shade for this work, tell them they don't understand your art.", "Spots look great! Just need to work on icing consistency. I recommend something like a 10 or 15 second icing rather than separate piping and flooding icing, though it's really a preference thing.  The more you practice the easier it will get. \n\nThe other thing is the store bought eyes lol.

I realized earlier this year that I've been doing it in some form or another for almost ten years. My first cookies were ROUGH, lol. It takes time to learn icing consistencies and best practices. You'll get better! Plus, these aren't that bad! Look at the positives: you've got a solid piped border and no bubbles in your flood, so you're on track with consistencies; cute wet on wet hearts; no icing overflowing the cookie; and no color bleed. \n\nAnd don't forget, the best part about learning to decorate cookies is eating your mistakes.", "I\u2019d eat em!

I won\u2019t comment on the consistency, others have covered that and there are a lot of YouTube videos that will help you! \n\nThe border with the piping icing looks too wide, I think maybe the hole in your icing bag is too large.  The opening should only be about the size of a coffee stir straw. Hold the bag about 1/4 inch above the cookie for nice clean lines and you have to hold the bag at the top, not the bottom. \n\nI also think you could just use some more flood icing on the cookies.  The surface tension of the icing will keep it from running over the side. \n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up, these are actually pretty good for a beginner!  Just like anything else, it takes practice.  Best of luck to you!!\n\nEdit: grammar", "I've made far worse!

As someone who sells decorated cookies, these are at least $5 each. I'm guessing they're about four inches tall? You've got at least six or seven different icing colors and more than a dozen designs. I get that for a charity bake sale you probably don't want to scare people away with high prices. Maybe you could do small bundles, like three cookies for $12? Don't undersell the work you put into these! They look amazing :)", "I\u2019d pay $5 for one of these beauties.", "For pics, get a large clean wooden cutting board (or an wooden table is even better), place next to indirect sunlight (or warm bright interior light), place one cookie flat and another cookie resting on the first one. Maybe get some pretty pine Christmasy decorations in the background and take pics with portrait mode on (or blur the background a little). Or place a bunch of cookies in rows but slightly turn each one to make it look a little more natural and fun, put them on brown butcher paper and take pics from birds eye view. You could even do a little set up where you take a bite out of a cookie and put it on a plate with a cup of hot coffee next to it, put the cup and plate in direct sun (so you can see the coffees steam) and take photos. You could create a cute caption about someone eating cookies. I can\u2019t think of one rn but I feel like it has great caption potential. You can also stack a bunch of cookies on top of one another and rest one cookie on the stack so you can see the design (I feel it would look best if the top of the stack is cut off out of the frame).\n\nI actually wouldn\u2019t recommend a white background.. it can be hard to photograph. I think light brown is easier to photograph on and looks homey-er.", "Really cute! Price will probably depend on your area. Where I live, you could easily sell them for $5-7 if you bag them nicely with a ribbon and all that. In other areas of my country, they would probably do better at the $3-4 range. \n\nDepending on how many you made and how big the turnout is expected to be, you might also want to consider a 1 for $x, 3 for $3x-$1 or so type of promo to encourage people to buy more than one without discounting too much.", "I\u2019d say at least $4. Were these photos taken at night? Try taking during daytime, in front of a window. Indirect light. You can use a white board or even a sheet pan to help bounce some light onto your subject.", "These look great! I don't have a price comment, but if you're looking to improve your pictures add some light, even a lamp with a daylight bulb in addition would go a long way to making details and color stand out!", "I would sell for at least $4 per cookie.", "As someone who used to work in a bakery, we would sell our regular cookies like chocolate chip or frosted sugar cookies for $1-2. I would say these are probably worth $5-6! For a fundraiser I think I\u2019d pay more for a cookie than I usually would.", "I would sell these for $5 if you put them in a cello bag with a cute christmasy ribbon. But also depends on your location, I'm in NYC. \nFor pictures, like everyone said, you need natural light but also a good editing app. I use and like Snapseed.\nAlso, something that helps your cookies stand out more is a light background. If you can, invest in a white or marble looking background . It doesn't have to be expensive, just not shiny or too marbley lol.

In total, this Easter season I made about 1400 individual cookies. About 950 were for the boxes, and the rest were for a couple of bigger special orders.\n\nIn the end, my sister (who is my usual helper) used her weekly permit to come and help me seal cookies in the last day. I was willing to do it myself, but by that point I was exhausted and making small mistakes because of it. So she really was a great help, and I was able to go to sleep at a decent hour. \n\nEverything went well with the deliveries and as far as I know, only one cookie arrived cracked out of the 75 boxes. I offered to add some extra cookies in that client's next box, as it's not easy to just send her more right now under lockdown, and she was happy to accept.\n\nI plan to spend today and tomorrow in as close to horizontal a position as I can manage.

I\u2019m not anything special, don\u2019t have an airbrush machine or days to devote to decorating. But this is what people see on Pinterest and instagram and when they ask for cookies they mentally envision this sort of skill and detail as the result. So when I do my simpler cookies people end up disappointed which then makes me feel like I\u2019m not good enough to even be trying. It\u2019s not your wife\u2019s fault and I\u2019m glad she doing it and teaching others and everyone is excited, but I find myself feeling like I don\u2019t belong in this arena anymore, like it can\u2019t be a hobby of mine anymore because I will never live up to the expectation. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m alone in this and anyone reading this will think I\u2019m stupid and maybe I am. But I miss the old days of cookie decorating when it wasn\u2019t such a competition."]}

But of course I've only learned a little from watching videos and reading about cookie decorating and techniques.\u00a0", "I think they're great but mine don't look much better. I think if we keep doing it we will be impressive one day too."]}

It was the missing piece to getting my icing to look perfectly smooth and flat.\n\nAlso, the perfect icing comes down to the viscosity of the icing. The best way to test this is to pull your mixer or a spatula through the icing and let it drip into the bowl, and count how many seconds it takes to go from having the drop on top to settling back to perfectly smooth. It takes some experimentation and the exact right timing will vary with humidity, etc., but generally 10 to 15 seconds gives me icing that\u2019s thin enough to flood, but thick enough to not drip all over the cookie.

For things that I know I want puffy icing in small areas, I prefer it to be more like a 20-23 second icing. Like just thick enough it doesn't completely settle on its own, but a gentle hand with a scribe or a toothpick will make it smooth out.\n\nThe cookies look great!!

This is likely your issue. \n\nThe other issue is that you need to work with a dehumidifier if it\u2019s humid. Draw that moisture out of the air. You need to have icing dry more quickly to keep it puffy. Always always always dry in front of a fan."]}

It came around the corner and appeared from the alleyway behind the garage, just 15 feet away and was so loud and shocking, that when I grabbed him to comfort him, I could feel his heart beating almost out of his chest.  \n\nHe was scared shitless, and couldn't speak at the time, but knew sign-language. He was signing \"scared/scary\" until it drove off, then signed \"more/again\" nonstop for literally an hour after that. We walked around the neighborhood and when we saw another, he jumped for joy like I've never seen before, but when the truck started to pick up trash, he got freaked again, so in his case, it was a unique mix of fear and amazement, which I imagine is psychologically impactful.\n\nI wonder if he will ever get over it."]}

That\u2019s why I felt it was so important to make this update \u2014 to empower, to educate, and to use my tech skills to help out the community I\u2019m so passionate about. \n\nIn this post, you\u2019ll learn what steps you can take if your intellectual property is being used without your consent and what you can do to proactively protect your work going forward. If you have any resources to add, please include them in a comment below.\n\n#What To Do If Your Work Has Been Stolen\nIt\u2019s a real bummer to discover your content is being used without your consent but here\u2019s the good news \u2014 you don\u2019t just have to sit there and take it. As a creator, you have rights. First, let\u2019s talk about when your work, the intellectual property (IP),  receives copyright protection. \n\n**Copyright Protection Begins At The Moment Of Creation**\n\nAccording to the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html), \u201cYour work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\u201d Additionally, you do not have to file for copyright protection for your creations to be protected, only if you wish to file a lawsuit. \nSo, if your work is being infringed upon, **it\u2019s time to take action**. Below you\u2019ll find helpful tips and tricks for identifying, documenting, and reporting copyright infringement.\n\n **Gather Information**\n\n* Record URLs for any **infringing** content\n+ Record URLs for your **original** posts\n- Gather evidence to support that you are the author of the content. A word of caution: Provide only what you need and nothing more and **watermark any additional content** if it is to be included with your complaint.\n\n**Documenting** \n\nIt\u2019s important to thoroughly document the URLs (including the links to your own posts) from the step above. Take special care to capture identifying information about the website, such as the URL, usernames, and timestamps for publishing.\n\n**Filing a complaint (website)**\n\nSome spammy websites do not include contact information such as an About Page or a Contact Form so tools like [Hosting Checker](https://hostingchecker.com/) will help you identify the hosting company to report abuse (usually found in support documentation). Tip: Search Google for the website host\u2019s name + copyright infringement and you should find the right documentation.\n\n**Filing a complaint (social media)**\n\nIf your content appears on any of the following social media platforms without your consent, you can easily file a complaint with the documentation you gathered in the above step. Below are links to each platform\u2019s help documentation for your convenience. \n\n* [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/about/copyright/dmca-pin/)\n+ [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help)\n\n#Proactive Tips For Protecting Your IP\n**Apply a Watermark**\n\nTo better protect your images (and to inconvenience the infringer) consider applying a watermark. The most effective placement is in the dead center of an image with just enough visibility for it to appear clearly.

I used to t6his but then I got silicone baking mats and those are a game changer/no need to poke or chill dough.\nYou also poke holes in small sections of icing before putting more icing on top, for example, if you want puffy/bubbly letters. Poking the holes helps prevent craters in your icing."]}

Practicing on piping sheets wouldn't really do it for me either, because it's not \"fun\" in my brain.\n\n\nInstead, I've been taking every opportunity I can to make cookies for different occasions!

For the very first cookies I made, I followed a tutorial on youtube for making a glaze icing and a specific design on a circle cookie. It was easy enough to follow along that I got hooked, and I ended up watching a lot of other cookie videos (on instagram and youtube) to try and learn through osmosis lol before I tried some more, like making a more traditional royal icing. I would definitely recommend starting with a simple shape or two (like circle or square) just to get the hang of piping icing at first. I think the best practice is learning as you go, but there\u2019s so many online resources you can use to help you be more prepared.\n\nThis is the tutorial I followed if you\u2019re interested! I only did the sand/ocean base; I didn\u2019t try making the transfers (the blanket, hat, etc). The instructions start around halfway through the video: https://youtu.be/ceV9X1QLb5A?si=R-uwhU8DjBD0XuxM", "I decorated cookies once a month with a friend. We would choose a cutter of a theme and play around with it!\n\nOne thing I wish I had known at the time is you can freeze icing and to not be precious with piping bags. Put extra icing in a new piping bag and toss in the freezer (i usually date it). Pull it out like a night ahead of when you want to decorate. I\u2019ll do the similar with undecorated cookies.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for suggestions for practice, i share free decorating guides + videos once a month at [iced.kitchen](https://www.iced.kitchen) and focus specifically on beginners and only use a circle cutter for simplicity sake.", "I think the most challenging part of cookie decorating is getting consistencies correct- so I think any avenue in which you can practice that, is important. Personally, I did the silly thing and I advertised my baking to friends/family/community for the cost of ingredients- which was absolutely a great way to practice, as it really pushed me, but can be a heavy place to start!   \nYoutube/videos are also a wonderful resource, as well as forums and groups on facebook and reddit. I am 100% self taught, with the exception of those resources! haha", "I just fuck around lol I always make cookies, I\u2019ve never done practice sheets, but I\u2019ll just pick a set I want to try and then try.

If you are trying to use regular piping bags meant to be used with tips, that could be the issue. \n\nIf you are using tipless bags, make sure the seam is laying flat face up when you cut the hole. Your hole also could be too tiny which is causing the icing to curl.", "A lot of the tipless bags are the same with different branding on them however I do prefer to decorated with 30 micron bags since they\u2019re a little thinner. I use the slightly thicker ones when I\u2019m using thicker icing for florals and using tips. I usually get mine from Sweet Designs Shoppe. \n\nWhen cutting the tip of the bag, I like to snip with the seam flat and then I flatten it out then opposite way and snip it again.

I'm staying up too late decorating. I need to streamline my timing with possible markets and weddings coming up. Curated sets take about 5 days from design to finish- is that really unexpected? When should I freeze in the process? Should I even freeze?\n\n\\---\n\nHi everyone!\n\nThis week was great. I had three cookie orders, and met the organizer of a popular market series who really loves my work. I feel awesome, and absolutely like garbage at the same time. Why you ask? Because of the **sleep deprivation!**\n\nI tend to do some higher detail and 3d shapes, and curated sets for my cookies (see my past posts!) and I know I need to let go of perfectionism. *BUT* I think people are noticing it, and I am hesitant to give up on what makes them special.

I am just really paranoid about when in the process they should freeze. Freeze after the bake, flood or detail? Should I even freeze for orders? There is a lot of different information out there!\n\nI'm sorry for the essay- I even have more questions but I will save those for a later post.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1jdgdxc/help_meeeee_i_keep_staying_up_way_too_late_to/", "created_utc": 1742227791.0, "score": 15, "author": "Ottershorts", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1jdgdxc/help_meeeee_i_keep_staying_up_way_too_late_to/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Immediate thing that jumps out at me is you need a dough/icing day.\n\nLike a day with no orders in mind, you need frozen backstock of dough and icing.

If you follow people like @hanamade.cookies on Instagram you\u2019ll see that she does a ton of her crazy detail work ahead of time. That way you can just do simple flooding and attach the details the week of the order. And as long as you can put the dried icing transfers in containers away from too much light; those things will last for a long while!\n\nI keep telling myself to do this but I am terminally adhd and struggle doing anything without last minute urgency. Like right now\u2026I should be making icing butterflies for an order now so I won\u2019t have to spend Thursday night making them! Instead I\u2019m here giving advice I should be utilizing!\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nMy other time-saver that I actually do is frozen dough sheets. I make some large batches of dough, then roll it out to the cookie thickness, and then Saran Wrap them. I keep stacks of these in the freezer so when I do have an order I can just pull a couple out, let them thaw a bit, cut out shapes and bake \u2018em! I have a decent amount of freezer space so I can make dough sheets that are almost half sheet pan sized. But I used to make them smaller to fit in my regular freezer.\n\nFor big projects I\u2019ll cut the shapes and freeze them in advance so I don\u2019t have to the week of the order.", "Hey! I feel like a lot of this is just finding your groove and seeing what works for you. It def took me a while to figure out a good schedule for me. I was doing about 20 dozen a week but started charging more so I did fewer and now I have a 3 month old so I\u2019m doing even less but grateful to still stay home with him and make some money. \n\nSo I have a fully dedicated baking kitchen so I know not everyone has this but it took me a while to get here lol\n\nI make two x12 batch of cookie dough in my 20qt mixer and freezer them in small packs of dough. I put them in the fridge a day before I need them and pull them out the morning I\u2019m gonna bake to let them thaw out. I bake all my orders for the week on Monday and freeze the cookies. Also I have a full size commercial convection oven so that\u2019s tremendous help too!\n\nI also make my RI in my 20qt mixer using 18lbs of powdered sugar at a time. I put most in the fridge and the rest on a shelf in my kitchen. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to do just 1 order at a time instead of flooding everything and then doing details. This way my details tend to not crater and the cookies aren\u2019t exposed to the air as long too. Flood, pop into the dehydrator for 14 mins, details, take pics and pack them up the next day. \n\nA lot of it has to do with me just getting better and faster at my craft. I felt like I was staying up way too late too and just exhausted all the time but once I raised prices, got bigger equipment and was able to streamline things more, it felt more worth jt. \n\nIf you\u2019re able to do presales for holidays, that\u2019s helpful too since you can bang those out faster. \n\nPop ups are fun too since you can make your own designs and get weird with it. \n\nYour process is pretty normal to me, cookie decorating just isn\u2019t for the faint of heart! It\u2019s a ton of work. I think it\u2019s just a matter of getting faster and hopefully getting some orders that are easier to make too. \n\nMy chef instructor told me on day 1 of pastry school that pastry is all about patience and practice and she wasn\u2019t wrong! Just know there\u2019s maaaany other cookiers up and decorating with you. Me included lol", "That\u2019s about my schedule too, only I do day 1 as early as possible. Practice has helped me speed up days 3/4. You can make icing and store in the fridge for a while, I keep mine for a week maybe two. Sometimes the colours separate, but that\u2019s a fix im willing to do.  So if you have the time and space in your fridge, you could do that earlier to save some time on day 2. \n\nHope someone has some better streamlining ideas!", "In regards to freezing: For pretty much every order, I bake the cookies in advance and freeze them until the day I decorate. Then, because I try to complete my orders at least a week in advance of when they're due, I freeze the finished order too. So I freeze mine at two points during my process. \n\nFor freezing finished cookies, I do everything I normally do to prep for packaging, like brushing with corn starch if I've used edible marker or lots of black icing. Then I go ahead and heat seal them in their individual bags. Those get placed in a big 2.5 gallon Tupperware container (stacked or standing upright in a row, the cookies will be fine either way) and put in my deep freezer. The night before I need them, I'll pull out the container and let it sit unopened on my counter to thaw overnight. The next morning, I just do a quick check to make sure all the condensation is gone from the Tupperware, and then they're good to be handled and packaged for pickup/delivery! \n\nI personally find cookies that have been frozen and then thawed to be so much softer and tastier.", "I like to leave most of my time for details. Most of my cookies are pretty detailed and time consuming as well (and I am terribly slow I my opinion) so your day 4 (details) is usually my day 2,3 and 4 lol. \nWhat helps me is:\nAlways have dough in the freezer. When I'm running low on dough, I check my calendar to see which day/week is a little slower than most and pick that as dough day. I have a Bosch mixer so I can do 5 -6 batches of dough at once. I try to do about 24 batches in one day and be good for the next month ish.. (takes a couple of hrs). It also helps that I have a separate chest freezer where I store dough, rolled out, in 2 batch slabs. I first wrap it in saran wrap, roll it as flat as possible to fit, and then put them in the bag and stack in freezer. On baking day which is usually my Monday, I take a slab or 2 out of the freezer while I'm getting my kid ready for school and then I just bake all of the cookies for the whole week. \nI also try to make a big batch of icing which for me, right now is about the amount that uses 3lbs of sugar. This usually runs out in a week but I can make more really quickly. I keep an air tight container with stiff icing on my working table or in the freezer if I don't need it in the next couple of days and use a little bit at a time. Something else that helps is always saving all extra icing in the freezer. That way I never have to start mixing new colors with white icing. That takes way longer. I have freezer Ziploc bags with all the leftovers. So my day 1 is usually- bake dough, color icing, flood. \nTues/Wed/thurs- details.\nFriday - pics and package. \nAlso regarding picking designs/color palette, I try to do it at night, over the weekend while watching TV or something. I like to take my time looking for inspiration/design ideas,etc and making a Design Board for each order, that way when it's baking day I already know what cutters to pull out. \nBest of luck!!", "If you plan your flood day to be a weekend, you could totally flood in the morning then do details later that day. You could also get a dehydrator to put the cookies in to be able to do flood and detail right away.", "I really like the make a bunch of dough ahead of time detail.\n\nAlso, depending on the design of the cookie you could start some details on the flood day near the end on the cookies you started first. Spend some of your cookie design day figuring out which order to do your colors. When flooding side by side, the icing doesn\u2019t need to be 100% dry before you start the next color or section; just dry enough to have a decent crust in it.\nFor example say you\u2019re doing 4 dozen pumpkin cookies with four \u201chumps\u201d: flood two humps on alll the cookies. By the time you\u2019re done with that the first cookies you started with should have enough crust on it to flood the second two humps. Then the flat part of the stem. If you\u2019re doing the leaves and stem with a thicker icing, those could wait until the cookie is nearly dry or fully dry.\n\nWhat part of the details do you get most behind on?", "U need to get urself a heat gun,  that way you can start ur details the same day.. no worries,  it took me this long in the beginning now it's only one day, 2 MAX. But the heat gun takes off days."]}

That will allow you to frost all the way to the edge (pipe a border of your thick icing right at the edges of your cookies, then use your thinner icing to fill in the border. When it dries, use the thick icing to create an outline or details like you did with these) and have cleaner lines in your detail work. \n\nIf you\u2019re using piping bags with piping tips (or if you\u2019re refilling a bag you already snipped!) before you fill them, fold the tips over so they\u2019re pointing upwards when you put the bag in the cup\u2014 that way the icing won\u2019t run right out of the piping bag. When you\u2019re ready to use it, you can gently squeeze your icing and/or twist the top of the bag to push it down into the tip. \n\nTo make yellow more gold, your instinct to add red was pretty good (sidebar: if you hadn\u2019t told me they weren\u2019t meant to be orange, I\u2019d never have second guessed that color choice\u2014 orange is one of the colors in the Irish flag after all, and is often used liberally alongside green & white in St. Patrick\u2019s day baking!), but you need to use way less of it at a time. Start with as much dye as covers the tip of a toothpick, mix it into your royal icing, and adjust in tiny increments from there. You can also use brown & green to adjust your yellow to be more gold, depending on what end color you\u2019d like to achieve. Both Americolor & Chef Master make color wheel cards for their ranges of food dyes that can help you learn color theory & master your color-matching skills! I\u2019m a trained pastry chef and I\u2019ve been in the business for over a decade and I still use my Americolor color wheel every time I need to color royal icing or buttercream. \n\nYou got this, and if you\u2019re up for sharing, I\u2019d love to see your progress as you get more into cookie decorating!", "Practice makes perfect!

I have a few suggestions for you. \n\nThere are lots of air bubbles here\u2014 after you mix your icing to the color and consistency you want, let it sit (covered) in the bowl for a bit to allow air bubbles to rise to the top. You can bang the bowl on the surface to speed this up. Then pop the bubbles before filling your icing bag. (I almost never do this, but it does help)\n\nAfter you fill and close the icing bag, before you cut open the tip, \u201chelicopter\u201d the icing bag. Hold it at the top and spin it around. This brings the air bubbles to the top of the bag so fewer come out onto your cookie. (I *always* do this, and it\u2019s fun)\n\nAfter the cookie is flooded, give it a good shake to help the icing settle. You\u2019ve got a few uneven spots that could be helped by shaking and probably also by using a little more icing when you flood. \n\nPamela Kennedy and The Graceful Baker both have great videos on YouTube about icing consistencies, check them out! There\u2019s a consistency called \u201cglobs and ribbons\u201d that I really like for one-consistency outline and flood\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t see there was a second pic so this is mostly a reaction to your very first set \ud83d\ude02 which is great for a first try and you\u2019ve already improved a lot!", "I'd ask Noah", "I teach cookie classes and the number one thing I would say people go, \"ohhhhhh!!\" On is when I show them how much icing you truly squeeze out to flood a cookie. You want to really be pushing it out of that bag and create a thick layer on the cookie. Once it settles, you won't see dips.", "These are great, you should be very proud of your progress!\n\nFor the curling icing, here\u2019s the usual culprits:\n- you did not cut straight across your piping bag (and using tipless piping bags). I tend to make one cut and then turn 90 degrees and cut again. Like another mentioned, sewing/embroidery scissors can work great.\n- your consistency is a little too thick, particularly for the size tip. Likely this is not your issue here as you\u2019re flooding cookies\n- your hand pressure is too much - or too little! Fun little riddle. Try a little less pressure from the hand and allow the icing to flow more from the piping bag and onto the cookie\n\nTo create that beautiful smooth base, add more icing than you think you should. You can use light reflecting off the cookie to see where any point of your flood needs some more.", "If I\u2019m understanding what you mean by icing \u201ccuring\u201d then it\u2019s as simple as you probably aren\u2019t cutting the tips off your piping bags exactly straight across. Next time you have this problem just cut the bag again, taking off as little as possible to make it straight. I use embroidery scissors to do this just because there\u2019s a little more control than with full size scissors! Also make sure you\u2019re using tipless/seamless piping bags."]}

{"title": "Making details with royal icing seems impossible - help!", "selftext": "Hi everybody,\n\n  \nI've started cookie decorating a few months ago and while I've improved, I keep running into the same issue. I find it really difficult to explain, so bear with me as I try.\n\n  \nEssentially, my royal icing is very sticky when I work with it. It dries fine in my dehydrator, and flooding and outlining goes perfectly. Where it goes 'wrong', however, is when I try to do any sort of detail. Even a dotted pattern seems to be almost impossible. My issue is that the royal icing, as it's super sticky, doesn't just allow for me to do blobs or dots or lines or basically anything. It doesn't matter if the consistency is super stiff or flooding, it just is impossible for me to 'stop' the icing when I want it to. I can pull as hard as I want, put less pressure, but after whatever I'm trying to do, a sliver of royal icing always follows. \n\nI follow a fairly standard recipe (4 cups of powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons merengue powder and water, amount depending on the consistency).  \n\n  \nNow, when I look at other peoples' videos, they seem to have no problem making dots, lines or any sort of detail. When they want the icing to stop, it just does. It doesn't matter what I do though, that's not how it works for me. \n\nI'm considering changing my royal icing recipe, perhaps egg whites would work better, but since that's going to be more expensive, I'm just really trying to figure out what I can do better. The other day I tried to make these sunflower cookies ([How to make Cute BUMBLE BEE & SUNFLOWER COOKIES - Piped sunflower technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ic_dfx2tFo&t=245s)) and the petals just ended up being like half an inch longer (spilling all over the edge and even touching the plate), just because I can't get the icing to stop where I want it to.\n\n  \nAny and all advice is super welcome...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1j3m6ni/making_details_with_royal_icing_seems_impossible/", "created_utc": 1741123921.0, "score": 1, "author": "bakingwithdemi", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1j3m6ni/making_details_with_royal_icing_seems_impossible/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

I\u2019ve been selling for 3 months now, I have a corporate job and I go out a lot socially, so I only take on one large order per week. It eats into my valuable time and I don\u2019t want this hobby to turn into something I resent or hate. \nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned:\n\n1) Do some research: I compare my dozen to some on Etsy of the same caliber. I saw Winnie the Pooh ones for $65/dozen online, so I charged $80/dozen (I figured I can charge more because i\u2019m local and deliver, with a 2 week lead time while Etsy vendors typically need more notice). Because I\u2019m in a high COL area, I know I can charge more. Some boutique bakeries here charge $13/cookie!!! Insane. \n\n2) Whenever you charge less than your worth, you will end up resenting your customer - even though it\u2019s your fault \ud83d\ude02\n\n3) I have a minimum of 1 dozen per order. Thinking of bringing it up to 2 dozen because of the effort to create the designs and custom colors.  \n\n4) it\u2019s not for everyone. Some people think it costs $20/dozen because that\u2019s what Whole Foods charges. My response is that they can feel free go to WF. It is NOT WORTH my time to match those prices.\n\n5) Have a high standard rate but offer discounts. I\u2019ve done $50/dozen for a friends&family deal, but they know that their friends can\u2019t expect that kind of pricing from me. Sometimes I start at $80 and say, \u201clook because you\u2019re buying xxx dozens, I can do $65/dozen\u201d. Offer discounts for good reasons but not because you\u2019re desperate for a sale. \n\n6) Don\u2019t promise a standard price. Maybe give a range, or what I do is ask them to contact me for a quote. Some designs are so complicated, I\u2019ve quoted $130/dozen for handpainted ones! \n\nAnyway good luck!! There\u2019s definitely a learning curve but you\u2019ll learn and re-iterate - it\u2019s all part of the fun of being an entrepreneur :)", "Don't announce a reason for the price change. Don't announce the price change. Just...change them. If you don't draw attention to it, it will fly under the radar of many clients, too.\n\n\nYou want the path of least resistance on this front. You don't have to justify your time or what it's worth if someone is willing to pay for it.\u00a0", "You are severely underpricing for a cookie that size. For a 3x4 cookie with a basic design and only white plus a couple of other cookies, I\u2019d charge at least $4.

If you\u2019re out somewhere rural, maybe $3 would be a better price.", "It also depends on your skill, but I am in a very rural area and charge $4.00 a cookie.

Looks like I need to do more research and know my worth!", "Blame it on eggs.", "Don\u2019t announce a change, just set the price. \n\nI like to have price tiers and I just changed all mine by $10 in Janurary. Didn\u2019t tell anyone, I just let them know the price per dozen for the type of details they\u2019re asking and charge accordingly", "Think about doing tiered pricing, I recently started doing basic cookies (3-4 colors and designs) and detailed cookies (5+ colors and designs). They\u2019re 35/45 a dozen respectively. I think it\u2019s undercharging by $10 a dozen but I keep my orders low, I\u2019ve taken 12 orders so far this year. I don\u2019t want to price myself too high to lose customers because this is as much a business as it is much needed stress relief. \n\nNow for seasonal items, take into account your packaging. If you package your single cookies in clear bags, charge a little less maybe 4$ a cookie. If you use those clear boxes and add a tag- you could easily charge 5-7$ per cookie. The fancier it looks, the easier it is for customers to justify a higher priced cookie. \n\nAlso, think about how you\u2019re advertising your cookies. Use nice photos, try to add other cookies in the background or even props like coordinating garlands or cutting board(s) stuff like that. Again, the fancier it looks the more you can charge. \n\nI hope this all helps!", "You can always \"pretend\" you are a customer and do an order inquiry and see what different people charge in your area.

On special holiday events or festivals, she makes 250-300 cookies and sells out within hours. Also, giving away free samples does not attract buying customers, just free loaders.  \n\nEdit to add: hopefully, your booth is in a good location in relation to the market and/or event.

{"title": "Sugar cookie spread questions!", "selftext": "I've made the America's Test Kitchen Family Baking Book holiday cookie recipe for years, and just recently started learning about royal icing and decorating. The cookie recipe is DELICIOUS and so I really don't want to tweak it too much or switch, but recent batches I've made are spreading. Looking back at October when I made Halloween cookies there was no spread (pre decorating-hobby research). Here are some things I've tried/noticed...\n\n\\- The Halloween cookies that didn't spread were rolled pretty thin and overbaked. Recently I've been rolling with guides, a little thicker than 1/4\", and removing when the middle isn't shiny.\n\n\\- OG recipe calls for 375 degrees, I've also tried 325 and 350.\n\n\\- Spread on silpat seems worse than on parchment, but on parchment the edges seem more jagged (if that makes sense)? Haven't had too much of a problem with bubbles, nothing I can't iron out with a spatula.\n\n\\- The dough has been consistently cold/freezing. The timing/placement of the fridge/freezer has maybe changed but should this make a difference? My recipe calls for mixing the dough and placing two 4-inch discs in the fridge at least 20 min, rolling out/cutting, and then fridge again until firm before baking. Since reading about other recipes I've been rolling out to desired thickness and cooling before cutting out, then again to firm before baking. I don't think this should make a difference since everyone seems to use the fridge at different points but maybe it does...\n\n\\- My recipe doesn't have  eggs and has a small amount of cream cheese. Most all others do have eggs and cream cheese doesn't seem to be super common. But again, I've had crisp edges in the past so maybe this doesn't matter.\n\n\\- Yesterday I added 2 Tbsp cornstarch which seemed to make zero difference.\n\n\\- My butter is room temp but not cool, as recommended\n\nHere's the recipe: 2.5 c AP flour, 3/4 c superfine sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 sticks cool room temp unsalted butter, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 Tbsp cream cheese room temp\n\nSorry for the novel - thank you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1ie6w32/sugar_cookie_spread_questions/", "created_utc": 1738298123.0, "score": 1, "author": "alexandra-faye", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/cookiedecorating/comments/1ie6w32/sugar_cookie_spread_questions/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Hi!

I always make a big batch of thick icing and then I can take some out of that and make the consistency I need. \n-your icing is probably over saturated with food coloring.when I color my icing, I almost never start with white icing, unless I'm making a super pale/pastel color. I always save all of my leftover icing. I keep all of my leftover bags of icing in a big Freezer Ziploc bag in the freezer.

So if I were to make black, I will grab all the bags of any color that have a tiny bit leftover and I don't need right now. I mix those all together and hopefully I'm left with something that's already dark and will only require a few drops of black food coloring. I stop adding coloring when it's dark grey.

I make dark grey, and then it becomes black as it sits for several hours or overnight.  \n\nUse as thick of a consistency as possible.", "For black royal icing, I do master elite black by the sugar art.

There are tons of them out there. This sub is also a tremendous resource and I\u2019m sure a search of your question in the sub archives will turn up a lot of advice! \n\nThe thing to understand about cookie decorating is the best way to learn is to just go for it. Watch a video and follow along. Practice practice practice is the ONLY way to learn. Good luck!", "Ah! My time has come. I've been waiting for someone to ask this so I can information dump (sorry in advance!)\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\* Also check out the Wiki on the right side of the page. I just spotted it and it is an excellent resource!\n\nI'm a novice myself-I started out this last October and have learned LOTS in that time. I'm definitely no expert, but I tried to document any mistakes (learning moments) along the way. Just check through my past posts and I usually have descriptions of what I learned.\n\nAgain, I'm not an expert and others might do things differently, but once you have the basics down, you can start getting really creative.\n\nFolks have already given you some recipes, so here is some random information as well as tools I have been using:\n\n**Tools**  \n  \n*Need*\n\n\\- Tipless Piping Bags\n\n\\- Cookie Scribe  \nYou use them to pop bubbles, even out icing, and help with fine detail decoration. You can find them on Amazon for a couple of dollars as well.\n\n\\- Gel food colouring.  \nDon't use the liquid type you get at the grocery store!! You will never get the right colour. I use Ann Clarke because that was given to me, but lots of folks use Americolor.\n\n*Nice to Have*\n\n\\- Dehydrator (or table fan)  \nIt gives the cookies a shine, helps stop cratering, and vastly decreases the wait time for parts of the cookie to dry. A table fan helps, but is not as fast as a dehydrator\n\n\\- Projector  \nGreat for writing on cookies and creating a cohesive style throughout your cookie.\n\n**Learning Resources**\n\n\\- Cookie Classes:  \nFind a local cookier near you! If you are a hands on learner these classes can be helpful\n\n\\- You tube:  \nAn amazing free resource for how-to videos\n\n\\- Online Classes  \nDon't mind spending a little cash for a walk through? Try an online class like on How to Cake It\n\n**General Advice**\n\n\\- Some of your work is going to look wavy and not how you want it. Just keep practicing, it takes time and I have had to start over/rethink things. Keep going! You have got this.\n\n\\- If you don't have a cookie cutter but want to try out a shape: print it on paper, cut it out, and cut the outline out using a small knife or kitchen blade making lots of little up-down motions (dragging instead of up-down motions causes the dough edge to be rough) Most of my cool shapes were done like this, but it is time consuming.\n\n\\- Icing consistency is key to making the shapes you want and having a smooth finish. If the consistency isn't right, take it out of the bag and fix it. It is a pain in the butt, but worth the result. You can fix the consistency in one direction or the other by adding drops of water, or icing sugar.\n\nIcing Consistency:  \n\\- Detail consistency forms soft peaks like toothpaste  \n\\- Hybrid consistency is like ketchup  \n\\- Flood consistency floods back into place in about 10-15 seconds.\n\nI hope this helps, and always feel free to reach out to the community with questions- we are here to help!", "Honestly if you can find a local baker / place that offers cookie decorating class for beginners that\u2019s a good place to start!

{"title": "Giving a few decorating tips", "selftext": "I started my cookie decorating journey about six months ago. I am definitely not a natural in any way. Who knows how long I will stick with this hobby, but it\u2019s been fun and a great way to give a personalized gift.\n\nHere are a few tips that I have learned along the way: \n\n1. You will need to practice way more than you probably think. I used to buy bins of really cheap sugar cookies at the local grocery store\u2026there\u2019s nothing like practicing with real royal icing on a real cookie.\n\n2. Many of the gadgets are really not necessary, but totally fun. I ended up buying a mini projector on eBay. It makes a world of difference, especially if you want to do any lettering.\n\n3. Sometimes the prep work involve to getting to a set of cookies is overwhelming. I tend to do them in stages. Make the dough one night. Let it chill overnight. Make the icing the next morning. Make my separate colors and let them develop over overnight. One big tip is to make a huge amount of just plain white royal icing that you can then keep in the fridge. As you need different colors, just take a little bit of the royal icing and color it.\n\n4. The consistency of your royal icing is everything. You can read about the different consistencies all you want, but you just have to experiment. One big lesson I learned is not to overbeat the royal icing as it becomes kind of marshmallow like. Once it becomes marshmallow like, it\u2019s very hard to get smooth cookies.\n\n5. You probably do not need a dehydrator, I use two tiny mini fans that were like five dollars.\n\n6. Make sure to let your flooded cookies dry overnight, or at least several several hours. Do not worry about leaving them uncovered while they are drying. The royal icing acts as a barrier and the cookie stay fresh.\n\n7. It is inexpensive and nice to buy one of those heat sealers. Put your cookies in a clear bag and heat seal them. They will last a long time that way.\n\n8. Making black icing is tough. Start with a base of black cocoa powder royal icing. Google it if you need a recipe.\n\n9. Never ever use water based food coloring in your royal icing. Most of us use gel. Some people use powder, but I have not tried powder.\n\n10. This subreddit is the most supportive place to ask for help or give help. Such a nice little online community.\n\nThat\u2019s it! Would love it if others would share their lessons learned.

Good luck!", "The only time I\u2019ve had my icing not dry (vegan or not) was due to overmixing. Ever since my very stressful and costly mistake, I only beat my icing for 2.5 minutes on high after it just gets combined on low. It adds the right amount of air for fluffiness but more time than that makes marshmallow fluff that stays sticky, weird, and takes color very strangely. I also use gel coloring, and minimal amounts, allowing to develop for an hour if I can afford it time-wise (for deeper colors- reds, blues, purples, blacks).", "Try adding a tsp of light corn syrup and omitting the aquafaba. Does need to dry longer than an icing with meringue powder though", "Icing not completely drying is most often due to overmixing. Overmixing will create a mixture full of these microbubbles (my made up word) that you can\u2019t really see. What this does is weaken the structural integrity of the icing making it impossible for it to solidify when \u201cdry\u201d. Try mixing less and see if that makes a difference.\n\nEdit to add: As far as color bleed, that could be a couple of reasons with the most common being over saturation. Over mixing may contribute to bleed as well. It could also be the type of coloring you\u2019re using. And just a tip, whenever I need rich saturated colors, I don\u2019t use white food coloring in my main batch. That will actually work against colors like black, red, and jewel tone colors. I found that I have to add more coloring which can potentially lead to bleed.", "Do you have to do a vegan recipe?", "It\u2019s probably that vegan recipe. Try making non-vegan to see how it dries.", "Have you tried adding white food coloring? I add white to all my icing and it\u2019s helped with color bleed. You could also be adding too much color. Is the icing fully dry before you use edible markers?", "Maybe try lemon icing. That's just lemon juice with powdered sugar. I haven't had any issues with bleeding I think, but I'm not a professional baker anyway.", "Egg whites or merengue powder is what makes icing dry. I\u2019d say that\u2019s your problem."]}

People will say this doesn't matter, but, it will give you a much better result. Measure it the same after sifting. The cookies will be less stodgy. I know of a bakery which triple sifts its flour.\n\nBuy the best ingredients you can. Quality in, quality out.\n\nUnless the recipe says to use soft butter or melted butter, it should probably be cool or cold. If it's too warm or soft before use, it can affect the outcome.\n\nOven temp can vary so when it's close to time, keep an eye on the cookies or other baked goods, in the oven. Do the toothpick (or you can use fork tines) test. The oven might heat it faster or slower than the one used in their (recipe maker) test kitchen.\n\nUse a toothpick to make sure something is 'done' but remember it (baked good) keeps 'cooking' *a bit* after removal from the oven, so it doesn't have to be all the way 'done.' If any batter sticks to the toothpick, it's not 'done.' The more batter sticks to the toothpick or fork tine, the more raw it still is.\n\nMost recipes say \"cool on a wire rack\" but I just put cookies on a large plate to cool. Use a very thin spatula and scoot it under them after a few minutes so they don't stick; and don't put more than one layer of cookies on the plate.\n\nIf you remove the cookies and leave them *on* the hot cookie sheet, they will continue to 'cook.' (Not good if they were done already or very close to done.)\n\nBefore you put more dough on the cookie sheet (to reuse it to bake more cookies), let the sheet mostly cool; maybe even rinse and wipe it off. The warm cookie sheet can cause the dough to spread out.\n\nOther than that, follow the recipe and it should be fine; good luck.", "As for the cake -- I've baked from a mix and from scratch. (They really came out about the same in the end, IMO.)\n\nI've had pastry chefs tell me they use mixes and so do a lot of bakeries. \n\nI'd use a mix if it is your first cake. You can make the icing if you wish. Buttercream is probably easier. The icing sold in tubs really is not bad either. \n\nI like Duncan Hines (cake mix), fwiw.", "You mentioned icing the cookies and being nervous about using royal icing and doing the piping.\n\nHow about spritz cookies. You just push them out of a cookie press. It's kind of a butter cookie dough. (Popular, nice taste and texture; no icing.)\n\nHere is one [recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/spritz-cookies/).\n\nThe page shows a fancy looking cookie press, but a manual one works fine and is probably a lot cheaper.

You should get \u201ctroll hair\u201d, or when you stick a spatula in and pull it out, the icing sticks straight out and doesn\u2019t curl over. \n\nThis consistency is great for doing very fine details and especially florals. \n\nUse a clean spray bottle to spray 5-10 pumps of water and you\u2019ll get \u201cDQ curl\u201d consistency. This is great for for outlining large areas and outlining and flooding small areas. \n\nAdd another 5-10 pumps and you\u2019ll get what people call 15 second icing. If you drip some of the icing back into the bowl, the bowl should smooth itself out without your help in 15 seconds. This is great for flooding large areas and doing wet in wet techniques."]}
