I'm currently on R2D29 and I have come to a realization that I think a lot of people doing the Whole30 are SCARED of..\n\nCAULIFLOWER RICE IS NOT GOOD. \n\nBefore you lynch me, just hear me out.. it's just bad. As we do the whole30 I understand we want a replacement for RICE. This is not the replacement we need. The main problem with cauliflower rice is the consistency. It never quite softens to the point where it FEELS like rice and will never allow for each kernel to absorb the juices of whatever you are adding to the cauliflower rice. This is a problem because when I eat my Whole30 curry or chicken fried cauliflower rice, I'd like to eat a nice flavorful bite of what I expect. However, I instead take a bite of crunchy bland white kernels of regret. The cauliflower rice somehow REMOVES flavor from the dish. I don't understand what dark arts are being used by the cauliflower rice, but it is unholy. We need to band together and stop cauliflower rice from being a staple in the whole30. It's time educate people and remove this substance from their lives. \n\nThanks for reading and if you have better rice substitutions please let me know!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/dorreh/opinion_cauliflower_rice_sucks/", "created_utc": 1572364420.0, "score": 307, "author": "lkopari", "num_comments": 79, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/dorreh/opinion_cauliflower_rice_sucks/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "P sure I made a dude fall in love w me bc if these dope compliant ribs I made.", "selftext": "Y\u2019all. These f-cking ribs. They were actually the best ribs I may have ever had. \nSo I\u2019m dating this new dude, and he\u2019s super cool about my whole30-ness and has been super supportive. He\u2019ll come over and I\u2019ll cook and he does all the dishes and even clean my stovetop (wut? He\u2019s perfect.) but holy holy last night I made these ribs and I\u2019m pretty sure I could lead a religious movement with this recipe so buckle the f-ck up. \n\nOK SO I used my instant pot and I did about 3/4 cups of broth and about 1 1/2 tbsp liquid smoke. \nI rubbed the ribs with equal parts salt, paper, garlic powder, all seasoning, and Cajun spices. \n I seriously got 2 full racks in the instant pot. In the pot, stand the racks on their side on top of the basket. If you\u2019re only doing one rack, it\u2019s easy just stick em right in like I said and pressure cook for 35. If you\u2019re taking it by the titties like I did with 2, you have to kind of wrap them. Think yin and yang. Cook the 2 for 45. \nOk so the bbq sauce\nI used\n8 majool dates, a small can of tomato paste, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1cup water, 2 tbsp Dijon mustard, 2tbsp coconut aminos, and 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper, and I added like 4 of these crazy good but hella spicy pickled jalape\u00f1os (holla atcha girl if you want that recipe but definitely not for the weak-of-mouth). Simmer over medium heat and keep stirring for like 8-10 min and use an immersion blender or transfer to a blender to mix. Set aside to cool and get thicc \n\nDo a quick release w those bad rib bois and be thoughtful taking them out, their gonna wanna fall apart. My suggestion is to take em out by the basket. Set em in a baking sheet w tin foil and slaaaaaather both sides with that good good bbq sauce you just made (proud o\u2019 you). Turn on the broiler in your oven and set it to high. Put in your lil bbq babies and let em sit in there for 10 min. \n\nOk so I knew they were gonna be *good*. But holy baby Lizzo, these were INSANE. I seriously think if I go down the line w this new (6\u20193\u201d bearded) hunk, I will ask him the moment he knew. And he *will* say it was these ribs. \nTrouble w the missus? Make these ribs. Proposing to your lil sugar babie? Do it over these f-cking ribs. Starting a cult? Gain followers with the promise and glory of these ribs.  It *will* work. \n\nLmk if you try them and have the same experience. I hope you do \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nUpdate: I f-cking love y\u2019all. I\u2019ll post the jalape\u00f1os soon \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/eunme2/p_sure_i_made_a_dude_fall_in_love_w_me_bc_if/", "created_utc": 1580130275.0, "score": 302, "author": "thekateturner", "num_comments": 55, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/eunme2/p_sure_i_made_a_dude_fall_in_love_w_me_bc_if/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I DID IT!!! 30 days!", "selftext": "I finished the 30 days of my very first ever Whole30!! I thought I\u2019d share my experience for anyone thinking of doing it.\n\n\n\nBackground: I\u2019m 45 (f), a fairly active person who has been pretty conscientious of what I eat for most of my life. But over the last 4 years I\u2019ve been really sluggish, foggy in the head and just dealing with crazy heavy periods as well as daily end of the day bloating that almost feels debilatating. I gained about 15 lbs during Covid that just won\u2019t budge. I can\u2019t get in to see my Dr. for quite some time to chat about these things, so I turned to Whole30 to see how I could help myself in the meantime while I wait.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou guys, I am SO glad that I did. This is literally the best I have felt in YEARS. I have been sleeping great at night, I no longer feel the need to take a nap in the afternoon just to survive. The cravings come and go, but honestly have really dwindled over the 30 days. Instead of feeling bloated and uncomfortable at the end of the day, I\u2019m energized enough to take my sweet pups on extra long walks to enjoy the evening.\n\n\n\nMy biggest takeaways for making this a success are:\n\n* prep prep prep - the more you can have easy things on hand, the more success you have dealing with hunger and cravings. If you\u2019re hungry, eat something, and being prepared takes the guess work out.\n* find things you like and stick with it. Don\u2019t feel like you need to reinvent the wheel each week with menu planning. I found things that I looked forward to eating and that kept me full and stuck with those for breakfast, lunch and snacks. Dinner was where I allowed myself to play around with variety.\n* fruit - this was a lifesaver for sweet cravings. Cold crunchy watermelon and dried fruits kept me sane\n* pickles - this really checked the salty box for me. Even just to grab ONE tiny kosher dill made me happy when my family was busting out the Pringles! Lol\u00a0\n* wine and Diet Coke have probably been the things I missed the most and had the most anxiety about giving up. But now after 30 days, I might just never return to them. The benefit of time has allowed me to reflect and wonder what purpose they serve in my life other than the pseudo-satisfactory crutch of habitual behavior.\n* Eggs! Turns out I have a mild egg intolerance. I would have never known this had I not already eliminated so many other things. It was so easy to pinpoint this and will be helpful when making food choices moving forward.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am excited for the reintroduction phase. I\u2019ll be starting with cheese.

{"title": "The Lazy Guide to the Whole30", "selftext": "This is for anyone who feels the hardest part of eating healthy is all the work!  There are no recipes here, just simple ideas.  Disclaimer, this post often sacrifices taste for convenience, so might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea.\n\nShopping list:\n\n* Don\u2019t underestimate canned food.  Canned veggies, tuna, and pasta sauce are great.  If you can find a compliant soup, stock up (I have the best luck with varieties like Split Pea, Butternut squash, or Bone Broth).  Do check every label, there is added sugar in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Premade condiments: I\u2019d recommend at least getting a compliant mayo and ketchup.  Salad dressing if you\u2019d like (personally I prefer olive oil + vinegar).\n   * Tessamae\u2019s, Primal Kitchen, Newman\u2019s Own \u201cDairy Free\u201d line\n* Frozen: chicken breasts, fish fillets, burger patties, veggies\n* Fresh: salad mix, eggs, potatoes, fruit\n* For coffee drinkers: nutpods or coconut milk.  Also, if you still don\u2019t like your coffee, give cold brew a try!\n* Sparkling flavored waters\n\nBreakfast\n\n* First, you can eat anything for breakfast, including last night\u2019s leftover chili or a salad.  Don\u2019t feel limited!\n* Hard boiled eggs\n* Fruit\n* Compliant pre-cooked sausage\n* Smoked salmon\n* For a little effort: a scramble with whatever veggies in your fridge or freezer.  I like pre-cut mushrooms.\n\nLunch\n\n* Salad (pre-washed mix, of course), topped with\n   * canned tuna\n      * or any other canned fish, I\u2019ve only bought tuna myself\n   * canned chicken\n      * want more flavor? Toss your chicken/tuna with guacamole, mayo, Frank\u2019s Redhot, or a vegan pesto\n   * shredded rotisserie chicken\n   * shredded deli slices (read labels, they often contain dextrose)\n   * hard boiled egg\n   * any leftover meat.  Anything you might put in a taco is great on salad.\n   * a \u201cprotein salad\u201d (from the original whole 30 book) is also a good salad topping. I\u2019ll make a good size batch of this so I can use it for several days.\n* Soup\n   * I like to make a double batch, putting about half in the freezer, and eat it all week\n   * Chili and Chicken soup are my staples\n\nDinner\n\nI will often just eat the above salad for lunch and chili/soup for dinner every day.  However, you can have some more variety without too much additional effort:\n\n* Pan fry a chicken breast or fish fillet, open a can of veggies on the side\n* Burgers (I put mine on some salad mix with ketchup/mayo).\n* Crockpot dinners:  Could serve on top of cauli rice (which you can buy frozen and microwave)\n   * Chicken+ salsa\n   * Roast+onion+peppers\n   * pork+compliant bbq sauce\n* Zoodles + pasta sauce.  They taste better fresh but can be bought pre-spiraled frozen.  Can add some ground meat here if you want.\n* A microwaved potato or sweet potato \u2013 good as a side with some ghee, or if you wanted to make it a meal, \u201cstuff\u201d it with some leftover crockpot meat from above.\n\nSnacks:\n\n* nuts\n* dried or fresh fruit\n* sunflower seeds\n* guacamole, almond butter, or dressing with mini carrots/celery\n* mini sweet peppers with Kite Hill spreads\n* Larabars (read labels)\n\nThe guide would not be complete without mentioning Meal Delivery.  You can find a list of Whole30 endorsed delivery services on the Whole30 website.  These are great if you don't want to have to think about it.  However, you are not limited to just those brands.  Check out any company that caters to the special diet crowd, particularly if they offer paleo!  Make sure to read through the ingredients as \u201cpaleo\u201d sometimes contains sweeteners like honey.\n\nAny other ideas are welcome :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/zug8f1/the_lazy_guide_to_the_whole30/", "created_utc": 1671908312.0, "score": 151, "author": "samra25", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/zug8f1/the_lazy_guide_to_the_whole30/", "html_title": ""}

I always considered myself a pretty healthy eater, I don't eat fast food, I work out, but I wanted to really understand what I was eating. This process has really helped me do that.\n\nPic on the left- this is the morning after a 6 course New Years Eve dinner and after drinking during the holidays basically every day. So I take the bloat with a grain of salt. However, I was deeply unhappy, mentally foggy, easily irritated, and my stomach was hurting pretty much every day.\n\nThe first week, week and a half of Whole30 was tough. My stomach still was hurting because my gut was healing. I'm at a point now (3 weeks in) where I have no stomach pains after eating and I'm enjoying all of the food I would normally eat otherwise- steak, potatoes, salads, eggs...just a lot more fruit for snacks and zero processed food! Lots more coconut milk/cream, tea, ghee, sparkling water, tomato paste, complaint condiments...\n\nI'm feeling good. If you are looking for a reset, I recommend trying this out and preparing for it by reading the cookbooks, the forums, and educating yourself about what you can and can't have at least a few weeks in advance!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/7lh3loefltdc1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1705854562.0, "score": 142, "author": "No_Painting_1669", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/19c7623/3_weeks_in_before_and_after/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Two Years Later: How Whole30 Changed My Life", "selftext": "Two years ago, [I wrote this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/3mzn9r/day_30_how_it_went_plus_nsfw_photos/) about completing my first w30. Since then, I've done two additional w30's and have been on the Paleo Diet non-stop, and I'm now at 165 lbs (after starting at 289 lbs).\n\n[Some relevant pictures](https://imgur.com/a/IkPqY) and [another set of relevant pictures](https://imgur.com/a/YHkMn).\n\nSome things I learned along the way.\n\n1. Go into your Whole30 with the mindset that you are changing your lifestyle and your relationship with food. This isn't a \"I'm going to lose a bunch of weight and then go back to eating like I used to\" diet. It's a way to reset your relationship with food, to learn about how your body responds to different foods, and it's a chance to wean yourself from sugar and grains.\n\n2. Change your habits. Following rules works only so far as you really analyze your eating habits and adjust to give yourself the best chance at good health. Weight loss is a bonus.\n\n3. While you're on your Whole30, if you are doing it to lose weight and/or to get healthy, really think about how you got to where you are at. I'm certain you didn't get heavy overnight; you won't fix this problem overnight. It will take time, and careful and deep contemplation. Only after you've identified the root cause of your eating issues can you really address the problem areas and make the necessary changes.\n\n4. Be strict. There is no such thing as a cheat day or a cheat meal. I call them sabotage. Cheating is when you gain an unfair advantage over an adversary or opponent. There is nothing to be gained by eating non-compliant foods. It's more like sabotage where you destroy any progress you've made and making it more difficult for future success.\n\n5. Change your perception: don't concentrate on what you can't eat, but focus on the great foods you CAN eat. Do I still love pizza, pasta, bread, and cake? Of course I do! But I have learned that there are so many Whole30 and Paleo compliant meals I can have instead that I never have to even consider the non-compliant foods. People are always surprised when I tell them the list of foods I can and do regularly eat includes things like sausage, BBQ, chicken wings, lobster, fish, etc (because the list goes on and on and on).\n\n6. Finally, but most importantly, perseverance. Change happens slowly. There will be times when you don't see any movement on the scale, or even see the numbers rise despite being good. Remember that the scale is but one of many data points that measure your health. The non-scale data is just as, and in many cases, much more important. Your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, liver enzymes, size, body fat percentage, etc. If I had a nickel for every time my weight went up while my waist size went down, I could buy lunch!\n\nWhole30 changed my life and my wife's life. I went from being obese to being fit enough to be in the National Guard at age 50. I run every other day, and my physical fitness test score was in the top 10% of the entire unit. My score was the top in my age group. I lost 110 lbs without doing a single step of exercise. I didn't start running until last September, joined the National Guard in February, and I'm now at 165 lbs. Together, my wife and I lost over 200 lbs in just over a year. That's amazing.\n\nI feel better, I have more energy, I am more flexible, and the best part: I am no longer diabetic, my liver enzymes are back to normal (I used to suffer from fatty liver disease), my vision has improved (as a result of my reduced blood sugar), my skin is better (less acne), and I no longer have nerve pain and circulation issues in my legs.\n\nIf you're on the fence about doing a Whole30, don't be. Do it. It's worth your life. The changes in my life since doing my first Whole30 has been incredible.\n\n[I started a blog](http://paleomarine.com) shortly after completing my first Whole30 and I have been answering questions ever since. I don't sell anything; to the contrary, I advise against pills, patches, powders, surgeries, and any products that promise weight loss.

Between my horomones, brain chemistry, and lack of sleep, I just haven\u2019t felt like myself. Aside from that, I have been turning to sugar and alcohol as a coping mechanism and I hate that I do it. I\u2019m fully addicted to sugar and there are some days that I\u2019m just counting down to my daily glass of wine (or two). That\u2019s not the type of mother that I want to be. So I am going to gain control over my body again and hopefully redeem some of that sweet sweet tigers blood. \n\nWish me luck!!\n\nEdit: thank you guys so much for the encouragement!! I feel so pumped to be able to tackle this thing!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/c1eoy2/my_reasons_for_starting_whole30_tomorrow/", "created_utc": 1560717785.0, "score": 119, "author": "thesatanicbarbie", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/c1eoy2/my_reasons_for_starting_whole30_tomorrow/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Budget Whole30", "selftext": "I was on a different Whole30 forum and someone posted an SOS because they were running short on groceries and on cash. I geek out over meal planning and cooking and I love me a good budget-related challenge even more so I wrote out how I would handle that situation for myself.  That post seemed to be a helpful read for several people so I figured I'd post it here as well in case anyone is wondering how the hell to do a Whole30 on a shoestring budget.  Hope this is helpful for some of you (even if your budget isn't quite so tight!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not sure where you live, but if you're feeding only yourself it shouldn't be all that difficult to make $65 last for two weeks.  \n>  \n>Frozen meat and veggies are absolutely fine--just as nutritious as fresh and often a lot cheaper.\u00a0 If this was me trying to eat Whole30 compliant for two weeks on $65, this is what I would do--I live in a large midwestern city with a pretty low COL and I pulled all information from Kroger's and Fresh Thyme's (a natural-type grocery, kind of like Sprouts but not as pricey as Whole Foods) weekly ads and websites:  \n>  \n>Kroger:  \n>  \n>Split Chicken Pieces (I would get thighs here because that's my preference): $.99/per pound x 4 pounds = $3.96  \n>  \n>Ground Beef (80/20, sold in a 3lb roll): $6.57  \n>  \n>3 dozen eggs: 18 ct/$1.29 x 2 = $2.36  \n>  \n>25.5 ounce bottle of olive oil: $5.79 \\*\\*Note on this--I picked the big bottle to use for making a batch of mayo and also to use as cooking fat, but they have a smaller bottle ($2.69 for 8 ounces) if you were feeling up to making your own ghee for cooking fat--you can get a pound of butter for $2.99 and turn that into a BUNCH of ghee which would be cheaper ounce per ounce if you're willing to put in the time\\*\\*  \n>  \n>Simple Truth Organic Coconut Milk: $1.89  \n>  \n>Frozen broccoli: 12 oz bag/$1.00 x 2 = $2.00  \n>  \n>Frozen Brussels sprouts: 12 oz bag/$1.19 x 2 = $2.38  \n>  \n>Frozen spinach: 12 oz bag/$1.39  \n>  \n>Frozen 3 pepper and onion blend: 12 oz bag/$1.39  \n>  \n>Frozen cauliflower rice: 12 oz bag/$2.19  \n>  \n>Frozen Stir Fry Veggie Starter: 12 oz bag/$1.39  \n>  \n>**Total: $31.31**\u00a0if you get the bigger olive oil, $31.20\u00a0if you decide to make your own ghee for cooking fat (basically the same cost at the outset but a pound of butter will net a lot more ghee than the olive oil)  \n>  \n>Fresh Thyme (all fresh produce here):  \n>  \n>Avocado: $1.49  \n>  \n>Green Onions: $.50  \n>  \n>Radishes: $.69/bunch  \n>  \n>Tomatillos: $.99/pound\u00a0  \n>  \n>Sweet Potatoes: $.99/pound x 3 pounds = $2.97  \n>  \n>Russet Potatoes: 8 pound bag/$1.99  \n>  \n>Lemon: $.50  \n>  \n>Lime: $.50  \n>  \n>Baby carrots: $1.29/1 lb bag  \n>  \n>**Total here is $10.82**  \n>  \n>**Grand total for both places: $42.23**  \n>  \n>So, what I would do with these things:  \n>  \n>Toss the broccoli, carrots, and radishes in some of your cooking fat, garlic powder, and salt and roast at 425\\* for 20-25 minutes (until they're all crispy and delicious)  \n>  \n>Roast your Brussles sprouts in the same manor--you can even do them at the same time!  \n>  \n>I would recommend using half of each amount of the veggies each week just so they don't go bad before you can use them. The carrots and radishes should last just fine in your crisper for a week.  \n>  \n>Poke holes in 2-3 of your sweet potatoes and let them bake for awhile--baked sweet potato is an easy way to get some starchy veggies in with any of your meals, I usually have them alongside my breakfast but I always keep some in the fridge for when I'm feeling uninspired  \n>  \n>Dice up some of your regular potatoes and toss them in a cast iron skillet with some of your cooking fat and some of the pepper and onion mix--cover the pan so the potatoes will cook through and get nice and crispy on the bottom and you have an easy potato hash to pull on for the week.  \n>  \n>Take some of your frozen spinach and\u00a0some more of\u00a0the pepper and onion mix and cook until it's thawed, drain off some of the liquid, season with salt and pepper as desired, and then pour in 12-15 of your eggs scrambled up with a little bit of water.\u00a0 Put the whole skillet in the oven at 425\\* for 15-18 minutes until just browned around the edges and set in the middle--there's a week's worth of breakfast frittata.\u00a0 Do this again the next week--I have a veggie frittata with some baked sweet potato and topped with some sort of sauce or dressing for breakfast every day and it is amazing.  \n>  \n>Take half of your ground beef and just cook it in a pan with some neutral seasoning.\u00a0 Let it cool and freeze in individual bags so you can pull out and mix with cauliflower rice or stir fry veggies for some quick meals--I love taco seasoned meat with cauliflower rice and\u00a0some salsa verde (I'm getting there!) and put it inside a mostly-hollowed out sweet potato skin for a pseudo-burrito.  \n>  \n>Take the other half and make yourself some burger patties--freeze individually to pull out as quick \"emergency\" proteins. They'll go nicely with either kinds of your roasted veggies you made above.  \n>  \n>Take your olive oil, and egg, and some of the lemon juice and make a batch of homemade mayo. I like Everyday Maven's immersion blender recipe. That should last you close to the two weeks and will be amazing delicious plated fat to top your burgers.  \n>  \n>Take your avocado, half the can of coconut milk, and the juice from the lime along with some salt and mix that together (with your immersion blender if you have it) for an easy avocado sauce to top your breakfasts or anything kind of mexican-inspired.  \n>  \n>Take your tomatillos and chop roughly and then blend with salt and pepper--easy salsa verde.\u00a0 Take half of it and keep it for your sweet potato burritos, and put the other half in a slow cooker or dutch oven with some of your chicken thighs.  \n>  \n>Some more of your chicken thighs--get your cast iron skillet rocket hot, put in some cooking fat, and put the thighs skin side down for a few minutes to get them deliciously crisp. Salt the meat, flip the thighs over and reduce the heat to cook through.  \n>  \n>This list and meal prep directions should easily keep you well fed within your budget for the next two weeks.\u00a0 It's not always the most exciting food but it will be tasty, filling, and healthy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/bpfyqu/budget_whole30/", "created_utc": 1558030356.0, "score": 124, "author": "FoodYarnNerd", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/bpfyqu/budget_whole30/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "R1D100 Thoughts", "selftext": "Well, I made it through 100 days of Whole30.  I never thought I\u2019d even make it through 10 really, but once I set my mind on it nothing was going to stop me.  At the end of day 30 I asked myself \u201cwhy stop?\u201d and, thus, I didn\u2019t.  Looking back on 100 days, including work trips to London, Chicago, and NYC, I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve achieved.\n\nMy secret?  I really don\u2019t mind eating the same thing over and over again, and I never got into the Feaux30 replacement foods (Whole30 Pizza! Whole30 Ranch!).  I understand some people need that to stay sane but I couldn\u2019t handle it, it just made me think of whatever I couldn\u2019t eat instead of enjoying what I was eating.  I\u2019ve stuck to some really simple recipes that I like and are good for me and I\u2019m happy.\n\nHow have I deviated?  I gave up coffee and most caffeine, because without dumping a load of sugar and cream into my coffee I just didn\u2019t enjoy it.  After about a week I didn\u2019t even notice a difference without the caffeine, and I went through 4-5 cups/day.  It was sugar I was addicted to, not caffeine.  For some reason I also tried to limit red meat.  I also weighed myself every single day.  For some people that\u2019s not good but for me it was essential.  Weight loss is a byproduct of Whole30, not the goal, but weighing myself daily kept me accountable and provided the motivation I needed to keep going.\n\nThe results?  Pretty amazing, really.  On January 2nd I weighed 296.6 pounds.  I\u2019m a powerlifter so I didn\u2019t look it but that number scared me, it was the most I ever weighed.  My blood pressure was good for my weight but still high.  This morning I weighed in at 238.1.  Blood pressure is fantastic, I\u2019ve lost five notches on my belt, and shirts that I never thought would fit again are now almost too big.\n\nMy encouragement?  Looking back on Day 5, Day 1 seemed the hardest.  Looking back on Day 10, Day 1-2 seemed the hardest.  Looking back on Day 100, the first ten days were the hardest.  It\u2019s always harder to start than it is to keep going.  Also, focus more on your intent than some of the rules.  If it\u2019s truly about breaking habits and resetting your relationship with food, don\u2019t anguish over the wrong type of lecithin your partner used to make dinner, your mind and intent were in the right place.  In the beginning I noticed some manic mindsets that were probably way more harmful than a secret gluten or sugar that snuck in somewhere.\n\nSo, when am I going to start reintroduction?  Dunno, I made it 100 days, why stop now?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/fz6v7z/r1d100_thoughts/", "created_utc": 1586616919.0, "score": 121, "author": "stainless13", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/fz6v7z/r1d100_thoughts/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "We did it! I am on day 31, my first Whole30 complete! Definitely not my last!", "selftext": "Husb and I just completed our first Whole30 yesterday! I figured I\u2019d put in our tips and lessons learned. \n\nAs a recap, I lost like 2 lbs. I ate too many nuts and snacked when I shouldn\u2019t have, even if they were Whole30 approved snacks. My main goal was to address food sensitivities so I did eliminate correctly, but I ate too much. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI don\u2019t know how much husb lost. I do know he was looking a bit thinner but he said some days he felt bloated and others he felt great. \n\nTips & lessons.\n\n* Don\u2019t let the first week overwhelm you. If you can make it through the first 10 days, you\u2019ve got it. The first week is definitely the hardest because you\u2019re still craving all your usual foods and not used to the new diet. It\u2019s also a lot of mental labor of meal planning and constantly trying to figure out what you can and cannot have. So much grocery shopping and trying to figure out whether or not something is okay. \n\n* Meal plan! I\u2019m usually a religious Plan to Eat user, but for this, I wasn\u2019t. For our next Whole30 (I\u2019m actually just full on eating whatever I want this weekend and starting R2 on Monday), I plan to meal plan a lot better. I think Plan to Eat stressed me out because so many of my meals were simple like homemade burgers and a fried egg + whatever veggie in the house. \n\n* keep simple things in your house. Make enough for leftovers. One thing that kept me successful was making breakfast sausage patties in bulk so I could just grab one or two with my breakfast in the morning. I also went to Whole Foods and found compliant andouille and chorizo and bought a few of them so I could use those. Breakfast is super important to me and having something I can make quickly with little thought was essential. Usually a hash with sweet potatoes and sausage and some eggs and avocado. \n\nAlso, I did hard boil eggs one night and I wish I would\u2019ve done more of that. It was great to throw two eggs in a bowl with some premade salad mix and celery and avocado and have an easy lunch. Being able to have lunch done in less than 3 minutes made it less stressful on days I would\u2019ve preferred to eat at a restaurant. \n\n* have someone who will legitimately commit with you. I had a full breakdown on day 10 and if my husband would\u2019ve quit with me, we would\u2019ve quit. But he didn\u2019t let me, so I kept going. \n\n* splurge a little. Obviously your grocery spending is gonna go up anyways, but add in some quality things you wouldn\u2019t normally buy. We ate a lot more steak and fresh fish (we live on a coast so we have a great fish market). It kept some variety and made things a bit better for us. \n\n* don\u2019t get overzealous and pin all these elaborate Whole30 recipes. Bunless burgers with a fried egg was our number one meal. I had pinned these chicken poppers and all this other stuff, but the simplicity of a meal was crucial to our success. You will be sick of cooking by day 5, so if you have something you can make easily, it won\u2019t wear you down as much. \n\n* don\u2019t try to substitute all your favourites. I know some people love cauliflower rice, but I hate it. Spaghetti squash may as well be SWYPO to me, because it\u2019s nothing like pasta. The first few days I was trying to make things taste like my grain favourites, and just kept getting disappointed. I was so much happier once I started making meals that were just actually Whole30 meals and not copycats of my favourite non Whole30 meals.\n\n* the unsweetened sauces and dressings you hated on day 2 are really good on day 12. I hated the primal kitchen ranch on the first day. I put it on my salad every day from day 12-18. We absolutely love unsweetened ketchup now. Your tastebuds just have to adjust.\n\nI didn\u2019t see all the crazy NSVs. I did a Whole30 to help my Crohn\u2019s and to get pregnant. It did neither, but it did help balance my hormones as someone who tracks ovulation. My Crohn\u2019s is kindof improving and I do think I have some sensitivities. Overall, I didn\u2019t repair my relationship with food which is why I\u2019m starting r2 on Monday and being more strict about the snacking and fruit, and I\u2019d like to lose like 10 pounds so I\u2019m gonna keep going. :) \n\nEdit to add update: husb and I just talked about it.

{"title": "If you eat when you're not hungry, you're distracting yourself from thoughts and emotions you don't want to aknowledge.", "selftext": "We are afraid of our thoughts and emotions. But what we don't see is that it isn\u2019t about them is about how we project them into a future scenario which makes them come into being.\n\nIn reality, I have discovered that there\u2019s nothing wrong with emotions. Having negative emotions isn\u2019t a problem, or that everything is over. Negative emotion mean we are forcing things to happen now, but we need to stick to the problem, and allow our minds to relax towards what happens, expose it to the problem, give it time to process it. When your mind is calm towards something instead of reactive, we will get what we want.\n\nAs Einstein says:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m so smart, it\u2019s just that I stick to problems longer than most people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a life-changing quote, if you understand it. Problem is when emotions bring us down, we believe is what is out there in the world but it isn\u2019t\u2026 Is in our attitudes, If you stick to the problem you get used to what is producing the emotion, therefore you don\u2019t create it again. When you stop creating negative emotions, your intentions surface and create inspiration therefore accomplishment, solutions.\n\nYou need to be aware of what is happening without escaping or distracting yourself from the emotion.\n\nIt may seem I\u2019m going off topic as it related to food and weight, but I\u2019m not. It isn\u2019t food why you eat, is not about the flavor, it\u2019s your problems, the things worrying you that make you want relief through food. You remember food all the time because life is not pleasing you in this moment. The solution is to stick to the problem and see what happens. Insight, happiness and calmness will come from there.\n\nPain is not why you don\u2019t workout habitually. Is because you worry and don\u2019t connect to your why. The pain is born out the lethargy and lack of ambition that you bring to your workouts. And why you\u2019re not ambitious? Same problem, you worry you escape your feelings and that makes them solid and robs you of your ability to be visionary and inspire yourself.\n\nTo deal with emotions, I recommend you to notice them in your body, see where they\u2019re located and meditate on them. At some point your mind will get stop thinking about it, and when that happens the emotion will go away, because negative emotions come when you react to things.\n\nYou can also take it slower and expose yourself to the emotions through 1 week every day, you will see they\u2019re considerably weaker each day.\n\nAnd a last very key insight, you need to focus only on the sensation, do not link it to any other problem you have in life. Every word or narrative you have is interpretation, and it depends on what emotion you\u2019re in, therefore they are all distortions. Focus only on the feeling and don\u2019t add words or images to it, but if that happens, no problem bring your attention back the sensation.

{"title": "Whole30 Jumped the shark?", "selftext": "I've eaten Whole30 \"clean\" over the last four years and have completed  12 strict 30 day compliance programs. The program is great but it seems that it has started to jump the shark over the last 24 months. When I first started out Whole30 was geared towards an elimination diet. The main point was to eliminate foods that potentially cause allergies and inflammation.  The program seems to have changed and be much more focused on intent as much as compliant foods.  Its no longer enough to comply with the ingredients you have to eat them in certain manner. Whole30 seems to be content not only to dictate what you eat but how you cook and consume it.  \n\nI cant cook whole30 compliant pancakes because they remind of a sugary food substance I used to eat? I cant drink V8 juice all though the ingredients are 100% compliant because someone determined the juice form isn't appropriate? I cant eat an RX bar because they remind me of a candy bar yet are 100% food compliant? There seems to be no rhyme or reason why one form of cooking and combining ingredient is compliant while another isn't. Why are Cauliflower mashed potatoes approved under these circumstances? They remind me of gooey yummy cream filled mashed potatoes...They should be non compliant, no? The famous whole30 turkey meatloaf reminds me of a meatloaf I get in a BBQ restaurant that is laden with fat and sugary BBQ sauce. Can I not eat the whole30 version?   \n\nWhat is the basis for restricting cooking and ingredient methodologies? The reality is that some people don't eat sweets and subsequently eating compliant/non compliant pancakes may have no effect while someone that doesn't eat sweets may have issues with mashed potatoes. Not everyone craves sweets or sugar and subsequently isolating things that may remind them of sweets would have no benefit to the program for that individual. To have a logical standard that covers all eating types the restriction should be whole food in their original and organic form.  \n\n\nOn the official forum the moderators often disagree amongst themselves and argue with the official stance of the program and no one can get a clear answer..I still love the food list and have found significant value in the program. I'm starting to wonder if they've jumped the shark and are diving into the intentions of why people eat instead of focusing on an elimination diet.

They said, choose recipes that you already like that are whole30 compliant or recipes that would easily become compliant. That really saved me.

{"title": "Whole30 Changed my Life [link to gallery in text]", "selftext": "[Gallery of my Journey](http://imgur.com/a/YHkMn)\n\nI did my first Whole30 back in September 2015. At 5'7\", I weighed 290 lbs and was morbidly obese. I was told by my doctor that I was at a high risk for a stroke or heart attack. I was pre-diabetic and was being advised to take Metformin. My joints ached continuously, and I was unable to tie my own shoes without holding my breath; my stomach was so big, it crushed against my lungs when I bent over. I could never sit in a booth at any restaurant, and flying was an absolutely horrible experience for me and anyone unlucky enough to have a seat directly adjacent to my own. Forget about putting a tray table down.\n\nEnter my cousin and Whole30. She was never obese, but she was always battling her weight. After doing a Whole30, she not only lost weight, but learned about food and eating good, whole foods. As a PA, she told me that she agreed with my doctor, and that I was very unhealthy at my weight. I told her I wanted nothing to do with exercise and she replied with words I can still hear today; \"What if I told you that you can lose weight, get more energy, and be healthy again without exercise? You just have to change your diet for the rest of your life.\" She had my attention. I listened. I then read, read, and read some more. The more I read, the more convinced I was that this was the way for me to get into being healthy.\n\nAfter much deliberation, my wife decided to support and join me on my Whole30. With her help, we began. We had some tough times that first week, but afterward, it got easier. Much easier. By the end of it, we didn't know what to do, so we just continued with eating Whole30 compliant meals. We slowly transitioned into Paleo.\n\nI lost 20 lbs that first month and my wife lost 10. I went on to lose another 120 lbs total while my wife lost 65 lbs. We both feel much younger, have more energy, and our health issues have reversed. I am no longer pre-diabetic and my cholesterol levels are all normal. Even things like my wife's acne and eczema are gone!\n\nSince then, we've done one more Whole30 earlier this year. We did well, and while it didn't change much for me, it helped her kick a sweet habit she'd picked up. I did it along with her as moral support; I have, and still stay away from anything sweetened.\n\nWhole30 changed my life. I am now in the National Guard. I learned to hang glide, I zip lined, and I now run 3-4 miles at least three times a week. Oh, and I'm 49 years old.\n\nI recommend Whole30 to anyone who asks me how I did it. I tell them that eating right is the foundation on which good health and even fitness lies. Without eating right, you're on shaky ground and fighting the effects of sugar, grains, dairy, preservatives, pesticides, etc.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/63novg/whole30_changed_my_life_link_to_gallery_in_text/", "created_utc": 1491419365.0, "score": 100, "author": "Edge767", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/63novg/whole30_changed_my_life_link_to_gallery_in_text/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My first round and the results!!", "selftext": "I'm overweight. Very overweight. I hit my highest weight ever at the beginning of this year and started having severe hormonal problems. I had acne like a teenager and raging PMDD. Earlier in the year I had lost 10 pounds, however I was stuck at the same weight for the rest of the year. Nothing I tried was working. \n\nOne of my friends posted on Facebook about the Whole30. She just completed her first round. She lost 15 pounds and said she felt her energy return to what it was in her early 20s. I was intrigued. I bought the book on my Kindle, and of course followed the instruction to read \"It Starts With Food\" first.\n\nI know the books state that the Whole30 isn't a weight loss diet. While that is my ultimate goal, the books made me realize that what I am eating is causing much more than weight gain. It's causing hormonal disruption, insulin resistance, etc. I felt that trying this lifestyle change may be the key to making me feel better. I was sick of being depressed. Sick of feeling disgusting and bloated after eating. Most of all, I was sick of being a sugar addict. \n\nOctober 9th was the start. I followed The Whole30 strictly for an entire month. \n\nBlack coffee became an every day thing. Eggs were my go-to breakfast food. I cooked meals at home every day and meal prepped like I never had before. I craved vegetables and fruit. I had my very first Halloween without any candy. I became creative with food and was never bored.\n\nMy energy went through the roof. My clothes were looser. My acne cleared up. My face became dewy and soft. I had zero PMDD symptoms when my monthly was due. I even saved $250 on my grocery bills since I wasn't going to restaurants.\n\nIn the end, I lost 14 pounds. \n\nI'm so thrilled. I feel like I finally have the proper template to turn my life around. It really does start with food.\n\nI didn't really have too many cravings during the 30 days. I was very focused and motivated. The \"tiger blood\" didn't hit me until Day 27, though.\n\nNow I'm working on reintroduction/getting through the holidays. I ate some cheese on Day 31 to start the reintroduction process, however feel like I'm just going to eat Whole 30 compliant other than on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Then I'll do another full 30 day round in January. \n\nAt this point, however... non-compliant foods really don't sound appealing to me. I like how I'm feeling. I'd rather feel energetic, light, and happy...rather than the sugar fog.\n\nMy life has changed thanks to a Facebook post.

{"title": "Why I broke Whole30 yesterday", "selftext": "I started a Whole30 on 1/2 and was going strong until yesterday. More energy, no cravings, everything was going great.\n\nUntil my car got stuck in a ditch. After waiting for 15 minutes, a car pulls over and the family invites me to come to their home in order to stay warm until AAA shows up. This amazing family of seven (not including their dog) completely welcomed me and made a stressful situation that would normally have me in tears very easy to deal with. Over the course of the 2.5 hours they offered to feed me, and while the food was noncompliant, I had not eaten since lunch six hours prior, and I did not want to be a rude guest to these amazing strangers. I ate small portions to hold me over and today I am back on Whole30.\n\nBasically, I'm wondering what the community's thoughts are on this type of situation. Do I need to start my cycle over again? I did not succumb to cravings, or overindulge. I just ate enough to sustain me at a time where I had no food and no clue as to when I would be able to return home (AAA was not able to estimate times because the weather caused a surge for them).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/ag0jtg/why_i_broke_whole30_yesterday/", "created_utc": 1547500869.0, "score": 98, "author": "ocelot3000", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/ag0jtg/why_i_broke_whole30_yesterday/", "html_title": ""}

For the first time in 7 months, I've been stuck at the same weight for a week. I'm ok with that though because I still feel myself getting better and stronger.\n\nThe catalyst for my change in diet was Whole30 and now I maintain a Paleo diet. I occasionally cheat with a little rice or a drink but I don't think I will ever have dairy or gluten ever again - I just get too sick!\n\nFor my workout, I run 3 miles, 3x a week. My pace is slow - about a 12 minute mile, but I was never a natural runner and building up my stamina was a huge challenge. I've been doing a little weight training as well (not much, just a rotation on the machine in the small gym we have in my apartment building).\n\nIn any case, I never thought I would say this journey has been fun, but it really has. I love running and can't wait to enter in my first event this spring.\n\nThank you to this community for always being so helpful and encouraging!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/5rpbpa/progress_pic_just_sharing_my_progress_over_the/", "created_utc": 1486068122.0, "score": 100, "author": "tonepoems", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/5rpbpa/progress_pic_just_sharing_my_progress_over_the/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Can\u2019t stop getting the ick from food", "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019ve been doing the Whole30 for 7 days now. My whole point of doing this diet is for the wake up call of stopping snacking so much and to see if I may have any intolerances or potential allergies, in short. \n\nMy diet before starting this journey is like many others, lots of boredom snacking, lots of easy and cheap meals: pastas, breads as sides or main course supplements, sauces, so much dairy, fast food every few days or so (I cook a lot already but very easy stuff), lots of sugary treats and cheese crackers, etc. not so many soft drinks or juices, I\u2019m good with my water. \n\nSo, I felt like I had a good foundation but of course the sugar/dairy/breads are the worst offenders here. Normally, I still get at least a helping of vegetables every day and fruit when I think to buy it, and I usually eat some version of a meat protein or tofu. \n\nEven on my normal diet: I get the ick from food somewhat often. The, not being able to eat the last couple of bites, suddenly I\u2019m very disgusted by my food even if it\u2019s food I like, can\u2019t keep it down. I wouldn\u2019t say this happens every day, but some days I\u2019m less tolerable to food than others. I\u2019ve always told myself that, sometimes, it\u2019s better to eat anything at all than to eat something I physically can\u2019t stomach. Which leads to sometimes things like ice cream being a meal, etc. I always try to force down things I don\u2019t want to eat. Again, sometimes it\u2019s food that I LIKE at the start of the meal and then it turns on me. \n\nI know this is mental, and part of my journey, but I\u2019m desperate. Ever since I started this diet, EVERYTHING gives me the ick. I have no safe foods to turn to. I am forcing myself to get enough calories right now but it is so much easier to think, maybe I won\u2019t eat at all. It takes me up to 30 minutes to finish a small meal some times because I\u2019m trying to force myself to eat it. No: I haven\u2019t resorted to purging anything, just digesting and feeling miserable. But a lot of times the taste and texture of these foods sit with me all day, in my mind, and making me feel nauseous all day. It\u2019s awful. \n\nNo, I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with any eating disorders, but I know that my reaction is definitely part due to trauma surrounding food, and likely part due to my current relationship with food? \n\nI LOVE trying new things, I love being creative with food, and I desperately want a healthy relationship with food. I\u2019m wondering, if anybody else went through a similar thing starting this diet? \n\nIf it matters, I do have ADHD, which I\u2019ve come to learn affects everything in my life. \n\nAny tips on how to silence the screaming child that wants to skip out on dinner and go to desserts? Or the child that so desperately wants to finish a meal that I DO like? Every food I\u2019m allowed to eat right now is torturing me. \n\n***TL;DR: every food on this diet is giving me the ick and I desperately need tips on how to get past this feeling.

I just find myself waking up around 3AM and staying up the remainder of the night just tossing and turning and maybe getting 10-min sleep cycles in between.  Its already been 3 nights of this and quite miserable, just making me overly cranky although weirdly, my energy levels not quite affected (probably just fueled by anger).\n\nIs this normal???

{"title": "Reintro: struggling with bodily awareness and inconsistent reactions", "selftext": "I did Whole30 and it wasn't as hard as I expected to keep with the diet. I lost 5 pounds but other than that I didn't really notice much change. \n\nNon-gluten: this went fine it seemed. I had oats and quinoa. However a week later when I had oatmeal for breakfast, I had excruciating stomach pain, something was uncommon for me even before W30.  It could've been something else but I didn't record the prior day's food (I needed a break). So I don't have those data. \n\nSugar: made myself sick eating too much of something. Sugar gave me more of a mental reaction to feeling disgusted with myself. This was part of the reason I did W30 in the first place but apparently giving me back the option of sugar put me back in the same habit. I'll eat whatever I can get sometimes to the point of feeling awful, but then I'll eat some more to dull the feelings of shame. \n\nGluten: didn't notice anything too weird. Maybe soke bloating. I had a vegan, soy-free pizza and it was heavenly. \n\nDairy: I may have had a bit of acne afterward. I don't have dairy too often or in large quantities so I'm not sad about this\n\nBeans: mild pain and major gas. I'm not sure what to do about this because they're a cheap food that bulks up whatever meal they're part of. I may experiment with preparation methods or different varieties to reduce the side effects. \n\nOverall, my discouragement comes from two main things. \n\nFirst, I'd hoped this would immediately zero me into some specific food causing me trouble. It may indeed be the beans, but my fear is still that it's due to me overindulging and making myself \"bloated\" that way. There's no quick fix to that. I'm worried it's combos of things. \n\nSecond, I feel like I'm lacking the self-awareness to make really detailed observations. Nothing compared to some of the stuff I see here. I was really only looking at bloating, stomach pain, and gas. Sleep wasn't something I was tracking, neither was acne. And I wasn't tracking energy levels either. I'd say now that my diet has laxed I feel a bit more tired, but that could also be because my sleep schedule has been disrupted by the US time change and I'm sleeping later. \n\nIt feels like a bit of a waste to do this if I'm not properly equipped to parse the results of the experiment. I don't know how to track energy levels objectively because it depends on so much, including just my feelings. I hoped I would just feel amazing like people said, and then feel awful upon reintroduction, and not have to be so exhaustingly meticulous with tracking. And then, the seemingly inconsistent reaction to oats was discouraging. \n\nI'm happy I finished W30 itself but it's really the reintro that I'm disappointed by.

What a journey that was, so good, an eye opener for me as to what I need to eat vs what I want to eat.\nContext: I am 47 years old, medium active, slightly overweight.\n\nWHY:\nI was so tired of quitting sugar only to start again. I was tired of feeling so full and bloated, but knowing why I felt that way. I had done keto last year and lost 15lbs, I felt great but returned to my regular eating habit and gained it back. I wasn't feeling good physically or mentally. While visiting Indigo with no intention of a life change, I saw the New Whole30 book on sale at and a lightbulb went off. I bought the book, came home and shared with my husband all that we were going to do. We set a start date, September 9th.\n\nTHE JOURNEY: To be honest, the change in eating came pretty easy to us. Don't get me wrong. There were times when I did crave hard but I just pushed through, stuck with the plan and I remembered that nothing changes if nothing changes. \nMy meals were pretty much this; \nCoffee: this was a big one, oh how I love cream in my coffee! I think thats the only reason I got out of bed most days. I wasn't able to find any of the suggested replacements near me, so I used a canned coconut milk and that worked. In fact, I don't plan on returning to dairy in my coffee. \nBreakfast: 2 boiled eggs, watermelon, avocado, Chia seeds, apple (the fruit combo changed daily)\nLunch: homemade chicken soup with veggies and a few potatoes\nSnack: mixed nuts (no peanuts) and a fruit\nDinner: grilled meat, veggies and salad (I did try a few recipes from the book, like the shepherds pie, so good!)\nWe really tried not to eat evening snacks but when we did it was nuts or fruit. \n\nTHE RESULT: my introduction plan is very small as I only plan to add back Quinoa.

I have done (almost an entire) Whole 30 before and quit many more but this time sticking to it has felt easier.

When I do the Whole 30 and when I've done keto-like diets (not that whole 30 is keto-like I just feel better on both diets) I feel better almost immediately, if not after a few days. When I do keto I'm charged with energy, I'm more regular, my skin looks better, I move better, my joints are less creaky.

For example, I've been eating a fruit w/ almond butter in the afternoon as a snack and I prefer to have at least 2 options for fruit for this meal so the following weeks I account for that when grocery prepping.\n\nI split the 30 days into 4 weeks and **I assign a type of cuisine per week**. I guess I reframed this as learning how to cook the dishes I like in a healthier way and grouping the recipes into the same week. Since the ingredients and flavors in one type of cuisine cross different meals, I can mix and match easier if the groceries I have fit the theme. (I'm not too strict on this).

{"title": "Editing W30 to Deal With Disordered Eating Struggles?", "selftext": "Hello! This is my second Whole30, my roommate and I did our first round two years ago - and started this one at the begining of September. \n\n5+ Years ago I struggled with overcoming an eating disorder. Had the tendency to starve myself, and would force myself to eat literally anything just to make sure food happend (usually toast, protein shakes, or whatever fast food my friends would force on me). I'm still trying to get out of the mindset of starving and binging, but it hasn't been a real problem until this week. I have had no appetite and have gone a couple of days now where I just eat the dinner roomate cooks because the effort for me to assemble a daytime W30 meal is too much, and the approved snacks sound nauseating. I'm struggling at work because I'm not getting enough protein to function. It's not the same W30 adjustment pains that I got last time, it's solely because I cannot make myself eat the options open to me. \n\n* For example the thought process for breakfast is:\n* I need to eat, but the sweet potato \"toast\" is too squishy.\n* Eggs take too much time, and are gross when premade. \n* Sausage is too much flavor, and bad texture\n* Bacon is too much effort to make every morning, too expensive to rely on\n* Potatos - I messed up with a rotten one last time I made them, and now I can't eat them becuase that's too gross\n* Fruit - last time I ate too much fruit it messed up my stomach so I don't want to eat that first thing in the morning\n* Salad - that's what we have for dinner a lot, cannot keep it fresh enough to bulk buy for all meals. \n* Smoothies - a lot of effort to make and clean, and too expensive to buy all the time\n* Lara bar - tired of them from last w30 and am sick at the thought of them.\n* Okay, never mind. I'll figure something out for lunch later on then.\n\n\n\nI don't want to quit W30, but I am debating changing it to a FODMAP elimination so that I can bring in some of my easy \"safe\" foods like pre-made Whey Protein shakes and rice cakes. I guess I'm needing some advice or validation. This doesn't quite feel like an official medical reason for me to quit W30 - it feels like I'm just \"too picky\" about foods to ignore the nausea and tough out whatever this mental block is. \n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1ffzgtk/editing_w30_to_deal_with_disordered_eating/", "created_utc": 1726246143.0, "score": 7, "author": "justagirlbehindadesk", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1ffzgtk/editing_w30_to_deal_with_disordered_eating/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Frozen TV dinner meal prep", "selftext": "I'm on my first Whole 30 round, and while I can cook, my busy lifestyle only allows me the time to cook once a week. I also cannot eat the same thing repeatedly- I would rather not eat at all. And I'm not too fond of microwaved food - whenever possible, I reheat food in the oven or stovetop. \n\nI bought a meal delivery service that offered compliant meals but found that I had spent way too much money on terrible food. I tried eating some of these meals, found them terrible in taste and texture, and threw the rest of the order away. \n\nI enjoy the In-n-Out double hamburger, protein style with mustard, but am not willing to deal with those lines more than once a week. I've had the Chipotle Whole 30 salad and have ordered a compliant Chicken burrito bowl, but both times, I felt like I was spending nearly $20 for a little bit of food. \n\nMy meal prep solution to get through this was to buy aluminum trays with lids from Amazon and make my own compliant TV dinners. On Sunday, I cook a meat entree and portion it into a few trays. Then, I add frozen vegetables, seasonings, and ghee or oil to two other wells, sometimes adding chopped nuts. Then, I make myself a little \"dessert\" by putting frozen fruit into another well and topping it with grain-free granola and a tiny bit of ghee. The lid gets labeled and added, and they go into the freezer until I'm ready to eat that meal again. The meals are filling, compliant, satisfy my need for variety, and don't kill my bank account unnecessarily.\n\nSo far I've made:\n\nZucchini noodles with meat sauce, summer squash, carrots, and a tropical fruit crumble\n\nMustard chicken thighs with \"cheesy\" broccoli (seasoned with nutritional yeast), cauliflower rice and a berry fruit crumble\n\nMeatloaf with Primal Kitchen gravy, mashed sweet potatoes, green peas, and a peach fruit crumble\n\nBeef stir fry with cabbage \"noodles\", snow peas with almonds and pearl onions, cauliflower rice and a baked banana dessert", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1f4ntfh/frozen_tv_dinner_meal_prep/", "created_utc": 1724996625.0, "score": 15, "author": "smellslikepeeinhere", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1f4ntfh/frozen_tv_dinner_meal_prep/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "R1D26 - things I've learned so far", "selftext": "A non-exhaustive list of things I've learned so far:\n\n  \n**1) To cook.** \n\nLike, I'd never really used an oven! Now in my mid/late 30s, my zero-cooking had become quirky part of my identity. But I am learning to cook! Nothing fancy, I have zero desire to host dinner parties (unless others bring the food), but I understand how to buy raw ingredients and turn them into edible meals and that's a huge change for me.\n\n  \n**2) I enjoy herbal tea.** \n\nI've always been a coffee fiend. I drink it black, and the fact that coffee was limitlessly allowed was a big factor in my even daring to try W30. But even I have caffeine limits and so I bought a bunch of herbal teas and found they cut the cravings and were very satisfying. I'm getting into tea! (the Pukka Echinacea +  Elderberry is my favorite).\n\n  \n**3) I don't need as much caffeine**\n\nBy drinking all these teas, I began to realize maybe I didn't need that 3p cup of coffee. Or even that late morning cup of coffee. And while the diet is not meant to tackle caffeine addictions, I'm down to one cup of caffeinated coffee a day. If I want a second, I'll have decaf. This is so wildly unexpected! \n\n  \n**4) Cashew butter is crack** \n\nI could eat it like ice cream. I don't, because I am aware of it, but I could. It's absolutely delicious. For real, this could become a food with no breaks for me. \n\n  \n**5) I've craved diet soda over any other single item**\n\nWhich surprised me and also made me really not want to drink diet soda anymore. It made me realize how hooked on it I was!\n\n  \n**6) I can have club soda and lime with friends at a bar and it's not that weird**\n\nI was super worried about this. And when I first started, I got a couple of \"oh you're not pregnant, are you?\" when I told friends I wasn't drinking (some of my friends are a rough crowd, lol). But it was actually fine. At this point the bartender at my regular spot now knows I'm off the rum and cokes and serves me my club soda. I will go back to drinking, but I know that I can curb it and switch and it's not a big deal.\n\n  \n**7) Too much spinach will turn your poop green \ud83d\ude43**\n\nAnd too much tomato sauce can turn your poop red. \n\n  \n**8) I can do this alone.**\n\nI started doing W30 with my boyfriend. I felt confidence knowing I'd have an ally and that he could help me, since he cooked and I didn't. But then, as life would have it, we broke up halfway through the round (not related to the diet!), and by then I was already doing most of my own prep and found I can be my own cheerleader and I was even able to resist the temptation to indulge in wine or consolation food because it means a lot to me to finish this round.\n\n  \n**9) I have generalized anxiety**\n\nOne of the major reasons I started the diet was all these testimonials about \"tiger blood\" and all this energy and better sleep. I have trouble sleeping, I often feel sluggish, and even though I have a naturally slow heart, I'd sometimes feel my heart race increase, especially at night or in the early mornings. I attributed this last bit to drinking: I don't binge drink, but between social meet ups and hobbies, I'd regularly drink 4 nights out of the week. \n\n  \nWell, I learned my poor sleep and sluggishness were not caused by a poor diet, and my occasional elevated heart rate was not due to drinking. Nope, turns out all of that is just anxiety and I can't just diet it away. It is something I'll have to tackle on its own after I'm done with this round.

{"title": "Food Freedom instead of a round in September?", "selftext": "Hi everyone! I did my first Whole30 about 5 or 6 years ago and pinpointed my sensitivities.  I then leaned into a paleo/sometimes Primal way of eating for the most part and felt great. In that time up until now we had the pandemic, plus I got married and had general life stress (my dog passing away, moving, getting a new puppy) which caused me to stray from my healthy eating at times (sometimes for a longer time than I liked!) and I also never really practiced sticking closely to whole30/paleo/primal while \u201cout in the wild\u201d, only at home. I used social situations for my 20% of 80/20 after everything reopened from the pandemic and we\u2019ve been slowly exploring new restaurants since we moved.  I\u2019m currently dealing with some new health issues which are causing me to really want to lean into anti inflammatory eating more often than not (potential lean PCOS- no insulin resistance or anything like that, just cysts on my ovaries and pelvic pain with some pins and needles feelings down my legs). My appointments to confirm this are the week the September Whole30 starts, and I\u2019m also starting physical therapy the following week. Since my initial appointment a month ago that found the cysts (they were watching to see if they would dissolve, I don\u2019t think they are), I\u2019ve been using the Food Freedom questions when I have cravings or we go out, since more often than not it hasn\u2019t been worth eating the food since it causes severe bloating and excessive pressure on my pelvis and pelvic nerves (I\u2019m also dealing with SIBO I suspect). I could do another round, but mentally and physically I don\u2019t think I have the energy, and my physical symptoms are causing me to actively choose cleaner eating and avoid cravings anyway. I also wanted to be able to have the chance to practice choosing better options when we do go somewhere without having to start over or panic if there\u2019s not a compliant option, and just choose the healthiest option available since stress makes all of this worse. Is anyone using the month to focus on leaning into their food freedom and making this a true lifestyle? Would you recommend joining the Cohort even if I\u2019m not on a round but want to stick to eating Whole30 more often than not?

{"title": "Delicious Meal Prep", "selftext": "This is my third Whole 30. I'd like to share some of my meal ideas that have made this round easier. I've been eating Amylu chicken sausage links, Aidell's chicken apple sausage, and Greenridge farm beefsticks in addition to beef, chicken and pork that I prepare. I use Primal Kitchen mayo and ketchup combined with Claussen's kosher pickles to make a burger sauce. Tessamae salad dressings are W30 compliant. I like their habanero ranch and lemon garlic dressing. I use coconut milk and Primal Kitchen mayo, add onion powder, garlic powder, Himalayan salt, dill, parsley, and pepper to make my own ranch. I used to make dump ranch but even with acidity, I don't want to eat raw eggs. I drink chicken bone broth and water with lime when cravings hit. I miss my diet soda so to treat myself, I'll drink a small bottle of sparkling apple juice or add a small can of pineapple juice to sparkling water. I prep pico de gallo to add to salads (tomatoes, onion, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalape\u00f1o), grill a tri tip roast and several chicken breasts (skinless, tenderized), seasoned with Tony Chacheres Spice & Herbs Creole seasoning. I roast beets and sweet potatoes and keep them chopped, ready to serve. Hard boiled eggs. I use these for meals throughout the week. I might have some steak with avocado and pico de gallo with spring mix and dressing. Chicken breast, avocado, tomatoes with sweet potatoes and fruit on the side. Hard boiled eggs, apples and almond butter for breakfast or have sausages with grilled onions and peppers or sauteed kale or spinach. Steamed artichokes with Primal kitchen mayo are good. Snap peas dipped in guacamole are very satisfying. Pork rinds are compliant but I only use these occasionally, to add crunch to taco salad. Not good to mindlessly snack on them. Brewed Cacao with coconut milk is really good if you don't like unsweetened coffee. For fruit, I have apples and berries or melons. The melons help increase water content we consume. The apples and berries provide fiber. This is all I can think of for now. Hope this helps someone have an easier time getting through these 30 days.

I started the whole 30 to be a lifestyle change and initial cleanse since I know I don\u2019t have any noticible food sensitivities from doing this before. I have been an over eater all my life but managed to lose 20 lbs a few years ago. I got a job in fast food and gained over 70 lbs in the last 3 years. I got so tired with looking in the mirror and hating what I saw. I still have a long way to go but I found what has worked for me so far is to severely limit any \u201cbad foods\u201d in my diet. I didn\u2019t beat myself up over not being perfect over these past 30 days because that wasn\u2019t the goal. The goal was to get ahold of my binge eating and learn to appreciate the \u201cbad foods\u201d in moderation. I feel like I\u2019m making real progress but I still have a long way to go. I follow this guide for most days of the week and for the foods I chose that aren\u2019t the best for me I have severely limited my intake of them in a single setting. Before these 30 days started, I was eating pizza up to 5 times a week at my job and I was eating to an uncomfortable point sometimes to the point where I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize how addictive sugar, food and overeating can be. I don\u2019t know what I was more addicted to - the food or the uncomfortable feeling of eating too much. I have definitely struggled with finding a good stopping point but I think I am getting the hang of listening to my body. I don\u2019t consider myself fully whole 30 anymore but I try to make most of my meals compliant so I can avoid extra additives that aren\u2019t necessary to my well being. \n\nI wanted to write this update for anyone considering this diet for whatever reason. Whether it\u2019s a jumpstart to weight loss, to quit sugar addiction, to identify any possible food sensitivities or any other reason. It will be challenging but very worth it. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you\u2019re not perfect. The important thing is consistency and trying to make more conscious decisions regarding food.

{"title": "Using ChatGPT for Meal Planning", "selftext": "Hey Whole30 friends. I have done 8 or more rounds of Whole 30 starting in 2015 and have hit food freedom and then fallen back to old habits and am looking to find my food freedom balance again. I prefer to cook whole30 at home, but lately between grocery costs, how I want to spend my time, and just life - I've really found myself pushing the easy button and eating foods that are quick in the moment, but tank my energy and mental health. Maybe this is old news, but I'm blown away by how much ChatGPT has helped the hurdle for me in terms of meal planning. Here are the questions I asked to simplify my meal planning and I hope this helps you too! \n\nP.S. I live in the south and it is humid and hot and all I want to do is eat a bunch of salads right now. Hence the way I framed my first question :) but you can do whatever you want - You could say, using the following proteins/ingredients (and include what's in your fridge already)\n\n  \n;TLDR I'm tired and I'm letting ChatGPT take the mental load off for eating healthy. \n\n1. Can you create a whole 30 meal plan for one week that includes fresh salads and seasonal ingredients using recipes from the following blogs; The Real Food Dieticians, The Defined Dish, Whole Food for 7, No Crumbs Left, and Paleo Running Momma. Please include links to all of the recipes. \n\n2. Then it gave me a different breakfast and lunch option and I usually prep these for the whole week so I really only need one option: I can eat the same breakfast and lunch all week. Please use the BLT Chicken Salad for Lunch this week and the Sweet Potato Breakfast Casserole for breakfast.\n\n3. Can you create a shopping list for this meal plan including how much of each ingredient is needed?\n\n4. I have 2 hours to meal prep for the week on Sunday. Can you create a plan to get as much prepped as possible before the week starts?\n\n  \nI did all of this in less than 15 minutes. You can always ask ChatGPT to remove or replace recipes if they don't sound appealing to you or you could choose the recipes and then put that into ChatGPT and still use the bot to create the shopping list and meal prep plan. I hope this helps someone the way it is helping me! Let me know if you have fun geeking out over it, too! \n\nETA: I noticed that sometimes the recipes recommended are no longer on the web since ChatGPT does rely on old data. I just went back to the saved chat and asked for them to write out the recipe it referenced and problem solved!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1dxn5r4/using_chatgpt_for_meal_planning/", "created_utc": 1720376621.0, "score": 52, "author": "wildwoodstitchwitch", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1dxn5r4/using_chatgpt_for_meal_planning/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Day 30 Tomorrow - Some Observations", "selftext": "Just finishing up my first round of whole30. I started this diet because I was having some digestion issues and I felt like I was squeezing into my pants. Just generally felt gross and wanted to take control of what I put into my body. Some background - I\u2019ve always eaten healthy (not a fan of soft drinks, junk food, limited dairy.) and am already quite thin so I wasn\u2019t doing this to lose weight. I started to note some things in my personal notes app but decided to do it here in case it was helpful for anyone. \n\n- sugar is in EVERYTHING. Why? It\u2019s seriously such a problem and it makes me sad that we have to deal with this so much as American consumers. I didn\u2019t realize it was in things like broth, hot sauce, dressing, etc etc. Now I feel like a more conscious shopper, like I have the choice to be more picky about what I buy, even if it\u2019s more expensive to buy the healthy version (again, WHY?!).\n\n- I feel less inflamed, which I heard was a thing but I was skeptical. Even my TMJ symptoms were less noticeable. \n\n- I still had digestion problems. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve identified the culprit as being high FODMAP veggies, specifically broccoli and beets. I had a horrible time after eating both of those things (on separate days) and had to take probiotics to get me regulated again. It was not fun - gas, extreme bloating, etc. I\u2019m extremely sensitive to garlic and onions, so I avoided those on whole30. On days that I didn\u2019t have these issues (more toward the beginning of my whole30) my digestion was great! Regular bowel movements and no bloating.\n\n- I got my period twice \ud83d\ude20 - the first cycle came a few weeks early, two weeks into my whole30, and the second cycle came a few weeks after that. The first cycle I had virtually no symptoms, but the second cycle I felt SUPER tired and lethargic and had my usual symptoms - bloating, gas, lethargy, and night sweats for like 3-4 days leading up to it. I had a very regular cycle before starting this diet so I hope I go back to normal. \n\n- cooking almost every single day is SO ANNOYING. I was better at prepping in the beginning since it was new and I was more excited about it, and now it feels like a chore.\n\n- because of my period coming twice, my energy levels and mood have not been consistent. I\u2019ve had days where I feel super energized and happy, and other days where I feel like crap - not like myself. Some family members have even commented that I seem down. This might have something to do with my period coming twice, so it\u2019s hard to really piece apart my symptoms when I\u2019ve had to deal with that. \n\n- my skin has been the same, to be honest - I still get these random rashes on my arm, and a pimple or two on my face.\n\n- best change - I can fit into my pants comfortably again!!! I generally feel more confident wearing my clothes; one pair of jeans specifically, didn\u2019t look too great on me before and now I love how they look. So that\u2019s a win!\n\n- overall, I really like being more conscious about what I eat, showing myself that I can control what I put on my body, to make sure it\u2019s something nutritious and healthy.

Willpower Boost: Saying no to tempting treats like alcoholic drinks and sugary desserts has been surprisingly empowering.\n3. Healthy Habits: I'm developing better eating habits, exploring the science of food, and discovering delicious new recipes for healthy snacking.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Persistent Bloating: Despite my efforts, I'm still dealing with bloating and stomach issues, especially since being diagnosed with post-infectious IBS after having Covid. \n2. Calorie Intake Challenges: It's tough to strike the right balance of calories without overdoing it on fat, which can be hard to digest and leads to gassiness, especially combined with all the veggies. Considering reintroducing rice or steel-cut oats for variety.\n3. Limited Food Options: Feeling a bit frustrated with the lack of variety and the \"wet\" texture of many Whole30-approved foods.\n\nOverall, while there have been challenges, I'm sticking with it and hopeful for more positive changes ahead.

(#kiddingnotkidding)\n\nI usually take my coffee with a splash of real cream and maybe a scant teaspoon of sugar if I want to bring out the chocolate notes in a particular brew.  On the Whole30, I have been defaulting to black coffee, since I found the almond milk creamers  bland and pointless.  Until this point, I'd rather drink it black than adulterate it with Nutpods.  \nHowever, I've been experimenting and I've found a combination that I think I will stick to forever going forward, as I plan to stay off dairy.  (I'm on day 26 and I have a thyroid issue, which is why I'm doing this).\n\nI had started blending my coffee with MCT oil a couple of weeks ago, and found that I liked the frothy texture of it.  Then I found this Califia Farms Better Half creamer on Thrive Market, and decided to try that since it has the benefit of having coconut cream added to the almond milk base.  Splash of cinnamon...almost there.  But yesterday, I had the bright idea to chop up a date and add it to the blender.   PERFECTION.  My coffee is now back to being eyeroll-worthy.

This is my 5th day of having super itchy legs and now it\u2019s progressed to full blown hives on my knees. I\u2019ve tried benadryl cream and eczema lotion (i don\u2019t have eczema) but nothing helps even a little. (Ironically, my partner who is also on the diet got their first full blown eczema attack on their hands a few days ago.)\n\nI haven\u2019t started eating anything new besides chomps sticks?
