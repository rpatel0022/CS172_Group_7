Orzo in this case refers to a rice-shaped pasta! It's made from semolina. In Italy, it's referred to as risoni (orzo in Italian means \"barley\"). \n\nSource: [Home Cooking Adventure](https://www.homecookingadventure.com/toasted-orzo-with-chicken/)\n\n**For the chicken:**\n\n1 \u00bc pound (600g) chicken breast , cut into strips\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\ngarlic powder\n\nOregano \n\n**For the Orzo Pasta:**\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n\n1 pound (500g) orzo pasta\n\n1 medium onion (about 6 oz \u2013 180g)\n\n5 garlic cloves , minced\n   \n1 red pepper (about 4 oz \u2013 120g)\n    \n1 cup (240g) tomato puree\n   \n 5 \u00bd cups (1,3 liter) vegetable broth\n\n1 tsp  dry oregano\n\n1 tsp  dry basil \n\nSalt and freshly round black pepper\n    \nChili flakes , optional\n\n    \nCut the chicken into long strips.\n   \nSeason the chicken on both sides with salt, freshly ground black pepper, garlic powder and oregano. Set aside. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the orzo pasta, stirring constantly, and toast for about 5-7 minutes until it turns golden brown.\nTransfer the orzo to a bowl and set aside. \n\nAdd 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the same skillet and add the chicken to the pan and cook for about 4-6 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook for another 4-6 minutes until golden brown. Check if the chicken is cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate. \n\nSaut\u00e9 the vegetables and simmer the orzo\n\nAdd the onion to the pan and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion softens. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute until fragrant.\n    \nAdd the red pepper and cook for 1 minute.\n\nAdd the tomato puree, dry oregano basil and chili flakes if used, and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly.\n\nAdd the toasted orzo and vegetable or chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.\n   \n Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered, for about 15 minutes or until the orzo is tender and the liquid is almost absorbed.\n\nArrange the chicken on top of the orzo and cook for 2-3 minutes more to let it warm through.\n\nGarnish with fresh parsley, and lemon slices and enjoy alongside a fresh salad. \n\n**MY NOTES**: So this recipe calls for vegetable broth, and I love vegetable broth, but I think this dish works better with homemade chicken stock. When adjusting your salt in this dish, note whether or not you are using stock with any salt in it. I like to use homemade chicken stock without salt added. This also means you'll want to season your chicken really well. You can always add salt but you can't take it out, so season at each stage and taste as you go.\n\nThis dish is great for weeknight family meals because it makes little mess and doesn't take long. If you want to add more vegetables, some wilted spinach or diced sauteed squash/zucchini work well. I've made it with yellow squash added in and I really liked the result.", "This looks remarkably similar to a chicken and orzo dish that I make at least once a month (though mine is a lot heavier on the tomato). I never thought to try toasting the orzo beforehand, definitely going to give that a go!", "I use orzo in a salad recipe weekly, its great! In your opinion how does this method of toasting the orzo first and then cooking like this compare to the traditional method. Awesome looking recipe by the way.", "Does finishing the chicken in the orzo add a bit more hydration to it? Will the chicken come out a bit dry?", "[deleted]"]}

It originated in 1898, created by Emma Rylander Lane of Clayton, Alabama. It's a big tall layer cake of white sponge and bourbon-fruit compote (in this post's case, peaches). Note: this recipe is pretty easy on the bourbon. I've seen waaaay more boozy Lane cakes (it's like fruitcake or trifle that way) so feel free to tinker with ratios. \n\nCake Layers\n\n2 1/4 cups granulated sugar\n\n1 1/4 cups butter, softened\n\n8 large egg whites, at room temperature\n\n3 cups all-purpose soft-wheat flour (such as White Lily)\n\n4 tsp. baking powder\n\n1 Tbsp. vanilla extract\n\nShortening\n\nPeach Filling\n\nBoiling water\n\n8 oz. dried peach halves\n\n1/2 cup butter, melted\n\n1 cup granulated sugar\n\n8 large egg yolks\n\n3/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut\n\n3/4 cup chopped toasted pecans\n\n1/2 cup bourbon\n\n2 tsp. vanilla extract\n\nPeach Schnapps Frosting\n\n2 large egg whites\n\n1 1/2 cups sugar\n\n1/2 cup peach schnapps\n\n2 tsp. light corn syrup\n\n1/8 tsp. table salt\n\n\nDirections\n\nPrepare Cake Layers:  Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Beat first 2 ingredients at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy.  Gradually add 8 egg whites, 2 at a time, beating well after each addition.   \nAdd batter to cake pans:  Sift together flour and baking powder; gradually add to butter mixture alternately with 1 cup water, beginning and ending with flour mixture.    Stir in 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract.  Spoon batter into 4 greased (with shortening) and floured 9-inch round shiny cake pans (about 1 \u00be cups batter in each pan).    \n\nBake cake layers:  Bake at 350\u00b0F for 14 to 16 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks, and cool completely (about 30 minutes).  \nBoil peaches:  Pour boiling water to cover over dried peach halves in a medium bowl; let stand 30 minutes. Drain well, and cut into \u00bc-inch pieces. (After plumping and dicing, you should have about 2 cups peaches.)   \nPrepare Filling:  Whisk together melted butter and next 2 ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, 10 to 12 minutes or until thickened.    Remove from heat, and stir in diced peaches, coconut, and next 3 ingredients. Cool completely (about 30 minutes).   \n\nConstruct cake:  Spread filling between cake layers (a little over 1 cup per layer).   Cover cake with plastic wrap, and chill 12 hours.  \nPrepare Frosting:  Pour water to a depth of 1 \u00bd inches into a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium heat. Whisk together 2 egg whites, 1 \u00bd cups sugar, and next 3 ingredients in a heatproof bowl; place bowl over boiling water.  Beat egg white mixture at medium-high speed with a handheld electric mixer 12 to 15 minutes or until stiff glossy peaks form and frosting is spreading consistency.

Then, lightly grease a 12-cup muffin pan with non-stick spray to prevent the cruffins from sticking.\r  \n\r  \n**Prepare Puff Pastry**: Unroll the thawed puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface to prevent sticking. If the sheets are adhering to each other, gently separate them.\r  \n\r  \n**Spread Nutella**: Evenly spread about \u00bd cup of Nutella on each sheet, ensuring you leave a small border around the edges. This helps to keep the Nutella from leaking out when you roll the pastry.\r  \n\r  \n**Roll and Cut**: Roll up each puff pastry sheet from the long end to form a log. Then, cut each log into three equal parts to make shorter logs. Slice each shorter log in half lengthwise, creating 6 pieces per sheet.\r  \n\r  \n**Shape the Cruffins**: Take each piece and gently wrap it around your finger, forming it into a muffin shape with the layered side facing outward. Place each cruffin into the muffin pan.\r  \n\r  \n**Egg Wash**: If you like a golden, shiny finish on your cruffins, brush the tops with the lightly beaten egg.\r  \n\r  \n**Bake**: Bake the cruffins in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes. To ensure even cooking, rotate the muffin pan halfway through the baking time.\r  \n\r  \n**Cool and Serve**: Once the cruffins are golden brown and crispy, remove them from the oven.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to classic Americanized Chinese cuisine with a look at a highly requested classic Chinese stir fry staple known as \"moo goo gai pan.\" For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing classic dishes from Americanized Chinese cuisine, then seeing what they might look like when reconstructed through the lens of more traditional wok cooking. Moo Goo Gai Pan is an Americanization of a Cantonese stir fry staple found on Chinese takeout menus across the country, which loosely translates to \"sliced mushroom and chicken.\" \n\nThe American version of moo goo gai pan is a pretty straightforward veggie stir fry containing button mushrooms, carrots, water chestnuts, snow peas, and of course, chicken, all sliced into thin pieces and sauteed in oyster sauce. Full disclosure, I am Chinese, but I don't think I've ever actually eaten the American version of this dish before, mostly because it is wildly different from the Cantonese dish that it was adapted from, which (amongst a few different qualities), specifically does not contain soy sauce, yielding a lighter and brighter quality to the stir fry. This of course makes for the perfect opportunity to two different versions of this dish so that we may compare results and take a look at what the are the American qualities of this dish, and how the two differ.

{"title": "How To Make The Best Homemade Butter In Less Than Five Minutes!", "selftext": "Full video here: https://youtu.be/wWBFB_Tqr44\n\nThere's an undeniable charm to homemade butter, a creamy and rich indulgence that's surprisingly simple to make. Beyond its luxurious taste, making butter at home offers the delightful by-product of buttermilk - perfect for baking and cooking. Today, let's churn our way to buttery bliss!\n\nIngredients:\n\n500ml of heavy cream (the fresher, the better!)\n\nEquipment:\n\nStand mixer with a balloon whisk attachment\n\nBowl cover attachment (if available)\n\nTwo bowls (one for separating, one for washing)\n\nIce water\n\nBaking paper\n\nInstructions:\n1. Prepare Your Equipment\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have your stand mixer ready with the balloon whisk attachment. It's handy to have the bowl cover attachment, too, to minimize splashing.\n\n2. Cream Into Whisk\n\nPour the cream into the stand mixer\u2019s bowl. The volume isn't as crucial as ensuring your mixer can handle the amount without overflowing.\n\n3. Whipping the Cream\n\nTurn on the mixer to a medium speed. Watch as the cream transforms, first to a whipped state. Keep mixing; you're not looking for dessert toppings here!\n\n\n4. Separation Point\n\nContinue whisking past the whipped cream stage until you notice the buttermilk beginning to separate from the milk solids. This is where the magic happens.\n\n5. Slow Down\n\nOnce the mixture breaks, reduce the mixer's speed by half to avoid a buttermilk tsunami in your kitchen.\n\n\n6. Butter Clumps\n\nWhen you see yellow lumps forming, that's your butter! Turn off the mixer and scrape down the whisk to gather your bounty.\n\n7. Buttermilk Reserve\n\nPour the separated buttermilk into a bowl. Don\u2019t discard it! This flavorful liquid is a baker's secret weapon - think pancakes, waffles, or our own KFC Popcorn Chicken.\n\n8. The Washing Phase\n\nPlace the butter into a bowl of icy water. Gently knead it to rinse out any remaining buttermilk. Clear water means your butter is well-washed.\n\n\n9. Seasoning\n\nMove the butter to another bowl and mix in a pinch of salt. This step is optional but recommended for that extra savoury edge.\n\n10. Storing Your Butter\n\nSpread out a sheet of baking paper. Place the butter on the paper and roll it up into a log. Twist the ends to secure your creation.\n\n11. Chill Out\n\nRefrigerate the butter until firm. This also helps the flavors to meld beautifully.\n\n12. Serving Suggestions\n\nEnjoy your homemade butter on toast, in your cooking, or as a base for flavours like garlic or herbs. The possibilities are endless!\n\nThere's something immensely satisfying about spreading butter when you've churned yourself across a slice of warm bread. The rich flavours are incomparable to store-bought varieties, and the process is a delightful nod to culinary traditions of the past.\n\nHomemade butter not only tastes better, but it's also a conversation starter - imagine the stories you can share about your foray into the world of dairy alchemy!\n\nIf you're inspired to try this at home, like, share, and subscribe for more culinary adventures.

Add the scallions to the pan to sear for 1-2 mins on both sides then transfer to a cutting board and thinly slice.\nWhen the cabbage cools slightly, remove the cores and roughly chop. Transfer to a large mixing bowl with lime zest and juice along with 2 tsp of sesame oil and another pinch of salt. Using your hands, scrunch and massage the cabbage with the dressing. Add the scallions, pepper, cilantro, and maple syrup, then toss again to combine.\n\n1. To a separate bowl, stir the remaining 2 tsp sesame oil with edamame together.\n\n1. To another bowl add the peanut sauce ingredients and stir until thickened. Whisk in 3-4 tbsp water until smooth (adjust with more water as needed).\n\n1. To assemble, portion out rice, top with some cabbage, top with a few garlic chips, edamame, and peanuts. Drizzle with the peanut sauce and enjoy.\n\n[Source](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzO4JU7Ldld/)", "This looks absolutely delicious, definitely saving this recipe to make soon!", "Mmmm burnt garlic", "The sauce looks like it would be good on stir fry chicken and veg.", "East Fork Pottery!

I'm dying.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)", "Hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to foods from TV and film with a shot at the \"City Beef\" from South Park. City Beef (as pronounced without the comically racist Chinese accent) has long been on the to-do list for this series for some time now. The main reason why we haven't gotten around to it until now is because it's pretty clear that City Beef is intended to be Mongolian Beef, which of course, we've thoroughly explored on the channel already. So! For today's dish as we search of another beef related Chinese stir fry to carry the City Beef title, we are instead taking a look at a tomato beef stir fry. \n\nFor those not familiar, the tomato beef stir fry has its origins from Chinese American cuisine, and most prominently features a seared and flash fried flank or sirloin steak, then saut\u00e9ed with veggies, tomatoes, and of course most importantly, ketchup to give it its iconically sweet and savory flavor. Finally although beef is fairly rare to come across in traditional Chinese cuisine (meaning that most of the time that you see it come up in Chinese food, it's probably of American origin), a number of fundamental cooking techniques surrounding flank and sirloin steak have their origins from Chinese cooking, due to their prevalence in Chinese American cuisine. Most prominently today, this is going to include a technique known as velveting, wherein we'll be using some baking soda and food science to turn this very tough and chewy cut of steak into a buttery soft piece of beef. Hope you try it.

Set aside.\n\nPrepare the Chicken:\n* Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise.\n* Now, find the direction of the grain of the breast and slice it into strips at an angle.\n* Cut the strips further into bite-sized pieces.\n\nMarinate the Chicken:\n* In a separate bowl, pour 500ml of buttermilk.\n* Add the chicken pieces to the buttermilk, followed by an additional \u00bd teaspoon of celery salt, \u00bd teaspoon of MSG, and \u00bd teaspoon of sweet paprika.\n* Mix it all together and let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour to 4 hours to marinate.\n\nBread the Chicken:\n* Take a small amount of the buttermilk from the marinated chicken and stir it into the breading mix. This will create little lumps in the breading mix which will give your chicken that extra crunch.\n* Now, take the chicken pieces from the buttermilk and coat them well with the breading mix. Ensure each piece is fully coated.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Filipino comfort food classics with a shot at a chicken and rice plate dish known as chicken tocino. For those unfamiliar, chicken tocino is made using a braised, then seared chicken thigh (specifically in that order), to create its simultaneously tender, crispy, and saucey texture. Perhaps most notable about this dish is its sugar-forward marinade, iconically made using pineapple juice for acidity, as well as ketchup, to give it its iconic, red color. While the dish is commonly made using bacon or pork belly (\"tocino\" translating to bacon, in Spanish), the use of chicken or beef is also fairly common, and is often served with a side of rice and fried eggs, as we often do with Filipino dishes. Maybe most interesting to me, though, is this dish's use of the marinade liquid itself as its mode for braising, which makes it a wildly simple and easy dish to throw together for weeknight meals.

Fold up edges of the dough onto the apples in the centre, overlapping sides slightly.\n4. Seal edges with egg wash (egg and water), and sprinkle with Turbinado sugar. Preheat oven to 400F (375F convection bake). Return your unbaked caramel apple galette to the refrigerator until oven is preheated.\n5. Bake Caramel Apple Galette for 45 min or until pastry crust is golden brown and apples have reduced in size (note: I used CrimsonCrisp apples which are extra firm and the Galette baked in 45min, adjust cooking time based on the apple you use. Start checking readiness at 40 min). Allow to cool on baking sheet.\n6. Optional: While hot, brush the apricot jam dilution on top of your apples for a glazed galette appearance.\n7. Drizzle the Simple Caramel Apple Galette with additional caramel sauce, serve with ice cream (optional), and enjoy!", "I like the idea of this, but my main issue here is the caramel sauce. You heavily use a unnamed type of caramel which leaves a lot of guess work on what type to use. Some sauces are sweeter, creamier, more bitter, thinner or thicker than others, and whichever I'd randomly choose would have vastly different outcomes on taste and texture.\n\nFor the future I'd suggest you make your own caramel sauce as a part of the recipe, name a specific brand(s) you recommend, or forgo it all together."]}

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to classic Americanized Chinese cuisine with a look at the Sweet and Sour Chicken, from PF Chang's. For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing classic dishes from Americanized Chinese cuisine (including a long and ever growing list of dishes from the PF Chang's menu), then seeing what they might look like when reconstructed through the lens of more traditional wok cooking. For those not familiar, the P.F. Chang's Sweet and Sour chicken, as expected, sticks pretty closely to how a traditional version of this dish would be assembled, which is to say, a battered and fried piece of chicken breast, combined with a medley of stir fried veggies, and coated with a vinegar forward sweet and savory glaze. \n\nThe source of our sour element today will of course come from the use of vinegar in our glaze, with our sweeter qualities iconically coming from the use of ketchup and pineapple juice. Perhaps most unusual about the PF Chang's sweet and sour chicken, though, is its light and golden coloring, which stands out because sweet and sour chicken is more typically tinted a deep dark red color, due to the high amount of ketchup included in its sauce. So, we'll definitely be taking a look at how we go about incorporating our ketchup today, as well as a closer look into how I might go about supplementing our sweeter qualities with a bit of sweet chili sauce and chinese red vinegar too. Hope you try it.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Korean comfort food classics with a shot at variation on the classic \"yang nyeom\" fried chicken, wherein we'll be making use of some corn flakes to create a unique, crispy, crunchy breading. For those unfamiliar, the Korean \"yangnyeom\" chicken is best known for its use of gochujang and honey to create its iconically firey red, sticky, sweet and savory glaze that we all know and love. For our version today, we will absolutely be borrowing a handful of elements that I think we've dialed in pretty well at this point (including our gochujang glaze made with just a touch of sweet chili sauce to complement our sugars). \n\nOur corn flake breading, of course, will likely be our most unique addition to today's dish, wherein the crunchy, crispy texture of the cereal will give us a nice head start on creating a crispy breading to our fried chicken. Maybe most importantly though because of this head start, this also makes today's fried chicken probably the most amenable to shallow frying, air frying, or even baking (in lieu of the deepfrying), since we won't be relying on the deepfry to crisp up our breading. So! We'll absolutely do a bit of comparing to see what yields the best results since (as many may know) one of the most commonly asked questions on this channel is \"can I make this without deepfrying? Because i'm afraid i might set my house on fire.\" Hope you try it.

Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to classic Americanized Chinese cuisine with a look at the Firecracker Tempura Shrimp, from PF Chang's. For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing classic dishes from Americanized Chinese cuisine (including a growing list of dishes from the PF Chang's menu now), then seeing what they might look like when reconstructed through the lens of more traditional wok cooking. For those not familiar, the P.F. Chang's firecracker tempura shrimp comes from the PF Chang's home menu, and is readily found in the frozen foods isle of most big box grocery stores. This of course is very beneficial to us, because it means it also has, you guessed it, a readily available ingredients list as well, which will be particularly useful in our efforts to reconstruct the dish's Siracha red chili sauce. \n\nTo go along with this, I thought it might be fun to assemble our own interpretation of a firecracker shrimp using a sichuan peppercorn dry seasoning inspired by a Taiwanese popcorn chicken to create a legitimately spicy and...firecracker-y shrimp. Hope you try it.

Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to classic Americanized Chinese cuisine with a look at the Sweet Fire Chicken from Panda Express. For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing classic dishes from Americanized Chinese cuisine (including a growing list of dishes from the Panda Express menu now), then seeing what they might look like when reconstructed through the lens of more traditional wok cooking. For those not familiar, the Panda Express Sweet Fire Chicken at first glance is pretty much what you might expect from a Panda Express fried chicken dish, featuring a battered and fried diced chicken, red bell pepper, onion, and finally one of my very favorites, canned pineapple.\n\nThe inclusion of pineapple of course being an homage to one of the most classic Chinese American dishes of all time which is Sweet and Sour Chicken, wherein the syrup that the pineapple is canned in is used to create the dish's signature sweet and savory glaze. So! For our version today we'll be borrowing a bit from the sweet and sour chicken recipe that we assembled a few months back, though we will need to make some key adjustments for our Sweet Fire Chicken here as we do our very, very best to recreate the light, bright color that appears to be key to this dish (this of course has always been tricky, because most elements that we derive umami from like soy sauce, for example, will almost certainly be working against us in this endevour).

Optional but recommended: A day or two of time, freeze the tofu in the package. Allow it to defrost completely (in the fridge overnight, or on the counter).\n1. Drain the tofu and use your favorite method to press out the excess liquid. (If you used the freeze + defrost trick, you can simply press out the extra liquid gently by hand.)\n1. Cut the tofu into roughly 1/2 inch slices. Any shape will work, but I like to cut along the long edge to get about 6-8 \"cutlets.\"\n1. Season each tofu cutlet with salt and pepper.\n\n**Bread the Tofu**\n\n1. Then set up a 3-part breading station.\n  * Dish 1: Add 1/3 cup all-purpose flour.\n  * Dish 2: Whisk together 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoon cornstarch, and 1/3 cup water to form a very thin batter.\n  * Dish 3: Add panko breadcrumbs. You might not need the full cup. Start with 1/2 cup and add more as needed.\n\n1. Dredge each tofu cutlet in flour. Shake off excess. Then dip in the flour and cornstarch slurry. Allow excess to drip off. Lastly, coat with the panko crumbs.\n\n**Fry the Tofu**\n\n1. Place a wire cooling rack over a baking tray so that the excess oil can drip off of your tofu katsu once it's done frying. (If you don't have one, you can line a plate with paper towels instead.)\n1. Heat about 1/2 \u2013 1\" of vegetable oil to about 375\u00b0F in a heavy-bottomed skillet or pot. (Use a Dutch oven or a skillet with higher sides if you want to avoid the splatter.) It is helpful to use a thermometer to ensure the tofu katsu cooks properly and doesn't turn out greasy.\n1. Place the breaded tofu cutlets in the preheated oil and fry 3-5 minutes per side, until deep golden brown. Avoid over-crowding the pot, as this can lower the temperature of the oil and make it take much longer to cook, resulting in greasy katsu.\n1. When golden brown, remove the tofu katsu to your prepared wire rack (or paper towel lined plate).

Generally 8-10 minutes at 350\u00b0F works well, but keep an eye on it to avoid it getting too dark. If you microwave it, it will be soggy.\n\n[Source](https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/tofu-katsu/)", "It's great to see Sarah's stuff on here.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to classic Chinese comfort food dishes with a shot at a Cantonese crispy beef chow mein made using super thin Hong Kong style fresh egg noodles. A quick review for those not familiar, a traditional chow mein as we all know and love it by definition must include some form of fry to the noodle (chow translating to \"fry\"), not unlike how we made our Panda Express chow mein, Hot and Spicy chow mein, Tomato Beef chow mein, and a few others. If it does not include a fry to the noodles, then it would otherwise be a lo mein, which is a different dish all together. \n\nSo! To accomplish this for our version today, we're going to be using a super thin Hong Kong style noodles made with a high content of egg, allowing for the noodle to puff up and fry very nicely in the wok. Bay Area locals may recognize this as the same type of noodle that we use for our crispy garlic noodles at the Woo Can Cook pop up. Finally to go along with all of this, we'll also be assembling a crispy beef made using flank steak and a pinch of baking soda in a technique known as velveting, to help us tenderize what would otherwise be a pretty tough cut of meat without some fun food science trickery.

Once tofu has been drained, pressed, and cut into small cubes or strips, heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium high heat.\n1. Add tofu and arrange in one layer in the pan. Season it with salt and pepper and allow it to cook for 3-5 minutes on one side, until golden brown.\n1. Give the tofu a toss in the pan. Allow them to cook for about another minute, then toss again. Repeat until most of the sides of tofu are golden. If the tofu starts browning too fast or the pan starts to smoke, you can lower the temperature to medium.\n1. Remove tofu to a plate. We will prepare our stir fry in the same skillet/wok.\n\n**Make the Stir Fry Noodles**\n\n1. Begin preparing noodles of choice according to package directions. Cook or soak until they are slightly undercooked/very al dente. (They will finish cooking in the sauce.) Some brands of rice noodles will only require presoaking in hot water.\n1. When noodles are almost done precooking/presoaking, mix together ingredients for sauce in a small bowl or measuring cup.\n3 tablespoons soy sauce,2 tablespoons rice vinegar,1 tablespoon brown sugar,1/2 tablespoon toasted sesame oil,1 tablespoon chili paste,1 teaspoon cornstarch\n1. In the skillet or wok you used to pan fry your tofu, heat a teaspoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Stir fry onions for 1-2 minutes, until they start to become slightly translucent.\n1. Add in broccoli and a small splash of water and cover the pan to trap the steam. Steam the broccoli for about 3 minutes, or until it is *almost* cooked to your preferred level of doneness. Add an extra splash of water if the pan dries out. (If you are adding in any additional veggies that have a longer cook time, e.g. cabbage, kale, green beans, mushrooms, you can add them during this step too.)\n1. Remove the lid and add in your sliced red peppers and julienned carrots. (This is also where you would add in any other veggies that have a shorter cook time, or things you want to keep slightly crisp.) Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, until they are almost cooked to your preferred level of doneness.\n1. Give the sauce a stir (the cornstarch tends to settle to the bottom), then add it to the pan. Reduce the heat a little if the pan is too hot and the sauce starts to spatter.\n1. Add in the noodles along with the pan-fried tofu. Toss to coat everything evenly with the sauce (tongs are useful here). Allow to cook, stirring occasionally, for an additional 1-2 minutes, until the noodles are cooked through and the sauce has thickened. If the noodles seem a little dry or the sauce is not coating the noodles, you can add an additional tablespoon of water at a time and stir to combine, until you have the right consistency.\n1. Taste and adjust your noodles to preference. Depending on the variety and exact quantity of noodles you used, you made need to add an extra splash of soy sauce (or you can simply use salt) so they're perfectly seasoned.\n1. Serve with any toppings you like. My favorites are fresh sliced scallions, toasted sesame seeds, and a little extra sriracha or chili crisp.

Hi everyone. Wesley here. Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese comfort food classics with maybe the only scenario where I have ever actually enjoyed a banana, which is a Chinese fried banana fritter, or \"zha xiangjiao.\" For those unfamiliar, some may recognize the Chinese banana fritter as a dish that frequently appears on the dessert menu of Chinese American restaurants, featuring a crispy battered and fried banana, often served with ice cream (the presence of dairy of course, should be your first tip that we are deep into the belly of Americanized Chinese cuisine). \n\nFor our version today, we'll be serving ours with a bit of honey and Chinese five spice, though I can tell you that I have come across a wide variety of toppings on this dish, including things like powdered sugar, maple syrup, or even nothing at all. What's most interesting to me about this dish is that while your more typical American style fritter would involve breaking down the banana, and working it directly into the batter itself (not unlike an apple fritter, for example), our Chinese styled fritter will involve keeping the banana in whole chunks, then coating it in a quick tempura batter. This is gonna yield a lighter and softer texture to our fritter, which is pretty unique from your more typical American styled donuts. Hope you try it.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Korean comfort food classics with a shot at the Korean tteokboki spicy rice cake. For those unfamiliar, tteokboki is a dish that most prominently makes use of gochugaru chili flake and gochujang chili paste to create its fire-y red sauce element, which is then used to simmer and coat our rice cakes, known as \"tteok.\" Those following along may recognize that this is certainly not the first time that we have made use of these cylindrical rice cakes. A few weeks back we used the same cakes in our buldak recipe, as well as our rabokki recipe some time ago too. \n\nMaybe more interestingly though, the Korean \"tteok\" rice cake is also the same cake that we refer to in Chinese cuisine as \"nian gao,\" meaning that we'll be able to find these rice cakes in both Chinese and korean grocery stores, which is very useful. Traditionally, a tteokboki would be assembled by simmering the tteok in a dashi soup stock, using the slow simmer to draw out the starches of the rice cake to yield our thick and luxurious sauce element. For our version today however, I thought I'd toy around with making some crispy fried tteok, meaning that we'll be first wok searing out rice cakes before adding them to our simmer, yielding a fun crispy, crunchy quality to our tteokboki.

To enjoy cold, simply pour the sauce over the tofu, top with the reserved green parts of the scallions, and serve!\n3.  If you prefer to enjoy the dish hot, you can easily heat the tofu by microwaving it for 1-2 minutes. Alternatively, you can steam the tofu for 5 minutes. Place it on a heat-safe plate, then place the plate on a steaming rack in a wide, shallow pot with a small amount of water in it. Cover and steam.

In a large bowl, and with an electric mixer on low speed, beat egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until frothy. Increase speed to medium-high and gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar until mixture resembles stiff peaks (note: this step may take a few extra minutes if using carton egg whites). Fold in vanilla extract.\n4. In 3 additions, gently fold flour/sugar mixture into egg white mixture until well incorporated and no flour pockets remain.\n5. Equally distribute spoonfuls of angel food cake mixture into each mini loaf pan. Bake for ~45 minutes or until angel food cakes have risen, spring back when lightly touched, and are gently browned on the surface.\n6.

Hi everyone. Wesley here. Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to TV and film with a shot at the egg custard tart, \"dan ta,\" or \"pastel de nata\" from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Those following along with this series may know that, although this is the first dish that we have done on from the Avatar animated series, we have now done a couple of dishes found in the Avatar animated universe. Some time ago we did the zhongzi sticky rice dumplings, as well as the sweet custard buns from The Legend of Korra. What I've always found interesting about diving into food from this series is that pretty much all of the food that you come across in this show is specifically cuisine that can travel easily, since the whole premise of both shows is that they are traveling across the four nations on top of a flying sky bison for pretty much the entirety of the both show. So! We come across lots of things like buns, baos, bamboo leaf wraps, and of course, egg custard tarts, which is neat. \n\nFor those unfamiliar, an egg custard is a pastry of Cantonese origin which (as you may have guessed) has significant influence from European baking in its use of a laminated butter pastry dough, filled with a custard made from egg and sweetened condensed milk. While the Cantonese \"dan tat\" (or \"dan ta\" in mandarin) that you'll commonly come across in Hong Kong would make use of a drier, more pie crust-like dough, today we're going to be making a flakier, more pastry-like tart of Portuguese origin, known as the pastel de nata.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese breakfast dim sum classics with a shot at the elaborately delicate and difficult \"har gow\" shrimp dumpling. For those unfamiliar, har gow (or \"xia jiao\" in Mandarin) is a dumpling of Cantonese origin that most prominently features a shrimp based filling, wrapped inside of a thin and translucent wrapper made from a combination of tapioca and wheat starch. The tapioca starch (as anyone that has had boba will tell you) lends a chewy yet delicate quality to the wrapper, resulting in a soft, pillowy, chewy bite to the dumpling that is very unique from the more typical flour based dumplings like potstickers or gyoza. \n\nDespite being rolled and folded like pretty much any other dumpling, these unique qualities that we get from both our tapioca and wheat starches combine to make for an interestingly difficult dough to assemble, since (as we'll see in a moment), one wrong move, and you'll end up with an absolute disaster in your own mixing bowls. Finally to pair with all of this, we'll be putting together a light and bright dipping sauce to pair with our shrimp dumplings, making use of some red vinegar to give our har gow a sweet and savory finish.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Thai cuisine classics with a shot at a grilled chicken satay skewer. For those unfamiliar, a chicken satay is a diced and marinated chicken thigh that's skewered onto bamboo skewers, then grilled over an open flame (or for our indoor purposes today, seared on a cast iron skillet). Chicken satay here in the states is a fairly popular small bite appetizer, most often iconically paired with a peanut based dipping sauce, which we will absolutely be including in our version today.\n\nNow, right off the bat before folks lose their goddamn minds, I'll first address that satay skewers come from MANY different cultural cuisines (though generally broadly originating from South East Asian culture), so I understand that the elements that we incorporate here may not be exactly how you remember your grandma making satay which, you know. that's cool too. That said, for our version today, we'll be incorporating a handful of ingredients that I do think leans our skewers pretty heavily into Thai cuisine, namely, a bit of lemongrass, palm sugar, and red curry paste to top it all off. As you might imagine, the \"grilling\" process to our skewers is not too complicated (probably the trickiest part is going to be about figuring out how to grill a skewer, without a grill). Our marinade however, is far from simple, being that it contains, possibly the most number of things that I have ever put into a single marinade, so, we'll be diving into why that is, too. Finally to round this off, we're gonna pair our skewers with a quick brined cucumber salad for a nice crisp side because i mean, you know. You can't just eat sticks of meat for dinner, right? ...right?  Hope you try it.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Korean comfort food classics with a shot at the Korean \"buldak\" or \"fire chicken.\" For those unfamiliar, the Korean \"buldak\" or literally translated, fire-chicken, is a grilled or fried chicken dish that (as the name implies) is best known for its spicy qualities derived from the use of chili paste or gochujang, chili powder or gochugaru, and a Korean marmalade known as \"cheong\". The pairing of these elements in turn go on to yield the dish's its firey spice profiles, as well as its signature menacingly bright red color, hence its name.  \n\nFor our version today, we'll be incorporating these elements into our chicken marinade with a couple of adjustments to accommodate for our home kitchen wok sear method (in lieu of the more traditional open flame grill), meaning that we'll need to rethink when we incorporate our sweet elements, to avoid the sugars burning in the sear. Finally to pair with all of this, buldak is often (albeit optionally) paired with a coin shaped rice cake known as tteok for a bit of texture to our dish, plus, you guessed it, mozzarella cheese, to give us at long last, the cheese pull that we've all been waiting for on this channel.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese dim sum and breakfast food classics with a shot at one of my absolute favorite pastries found in pretty much any Chinese bakery worth it's salt, which is the Chinese curry puff pastry, or \"jia li jiao.\" For those unfamiliar, as the name implies, a jia li jiao is comprised of a curried ground mince meat filling, tucked inside of a pastry dough made with sheets of laminated butter. This in turn yields a wonderfully puffy, flakey, crossiant like texture to our pastry, not unlike I'm sure, pretty much every French pastry that you can think of. \n\nThis of course is because the idea of a pastry dough filled with ground meat is not a particularly complicated concept, which of course means that (as with many culinary concepts), it transcends throughout a whole bunch of different cultural cuisines, reminiscent of the Agrentinian empanada, the Jamaician meat pie, and many others, which is, pretty cool. Honestly, one of my favorite things about cooking, really. For our jia li jiao version today, we're gonna include a few quintessentially Chinese elements to create our bright and savory curry including a bit of shaoxing wine and oyster sauce. Then because as many of you may know, I'm always a sucker for a good shortcut, we're also gonna take a look at how to get away with skipping the long and ardious step of laminating butter into a pastry dough, since, as you might have guessed, what we just described is a fantastic, readily available premade frozen product known as...puff pastry.

If you want to keep it more traditional, you can skip the mozzarella. You can also skip the olives if you want, but I like them in the sauce.\n\nNote: For the purpose of the video and not needing to cook chicken in batches, I only used 4 chicken thighs (the ones I bought were huge). For the amount of sauce in the recipe, I recommend 6 thighs for 6 servings.\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 3 carrots, peeled and diced\n* 8 ounces button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced\n* 3 tablespoons butter\n* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning (or use 1 teaspoon dry thyme and 1 teaspoon dry oregano)\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper\n* 10-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* \u00bd cup red wine\n* 14.5-ounce can cherry or whole peeled tomatoes\n* 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n* Pinch of sugar, optional\n* 6-ounce jar pitted Castelvetrano olives, drained and torn in half\n* 8-ounce ball fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced into rounds\n* Extra virgin olive oil\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Cooked pappardelle or tagliatelle pasta (or crusty bread or polenta)\n* Minced parsley\n\n**Fry the chicken:**\n\n1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat the 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken thighs, in batches if needed, skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the bottom of the pot. Flip and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Keep the pot on medium-high heat.\n\n**Cook the aromatics:**\n\n1. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, stirring regularly, for 8\u201310 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the diced onion and carrots to the mushrooms. Saut\u00e9 an additional 8 minutes until the onions begin to soften.\n3. Melt the butter into the pot and add the garlic, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the red bell peppers and cook for 1 minute.\n\n**Brown the tomato paste:**\n\n1. Add the tomato paste to the pot. Cook, stirring and mashing the paste into the pot, for 3\u20134 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium as needed to prevent it from burning. The paste will sizzle, deepen in color, and stick to the bottom of the pot.\n2. Pour the wine into the pot and bring it to a boil. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n1. Add both cans of tomatoes. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, taste the sauce, and add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed. Add the chicken to the pot, spooning the sauce so that it completely covers the chicken.\n2. Cover the pot and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure that the sauce isn't sticking.\n3. After 30 minutes, remove the lid and add the torn olives, stirring them into the sauce. Cover and simmer for an additional 10 minutes or until the temperature of the chicken reaches 165\u00baF.\n\n**Finish the chicken cacciatore:**\n\n1. Turn on the broiler. Remove the lid from the pot. Arrange the sliced mozzarella on top and drizzle with a teaspoon or two of extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler for 2\u20134 minutes or until the cheese is browned and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Sprinkle the chicken and sauce with freshly minced parsley. Serve with pasta or crusty bread.

Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to classic Americanized Chinese cuisine with a look at the Kung Pao Chicken from PF Chang's. For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing classic dishes from Americanized Chinese cuisine (including now, a whooole bunch of stuff from PF Chang's), then seeing what they might look like when reconstructed through the lens of more traditional wok cooking. Kung Pao chicken of course is not an unfamiliar sight on this channel, some may recall that we took our best shot at the Panda Express kung pao chicken last year, as well as our own version done on a 200,000 BTU wok burner a few months back, too. Its concept is not a particularly complicated one, kung pao chicken is essentially a stir fry featuring a wok seared piece of chicken and crispy flash fried vegetable. \n\nAs with most stir fries, the vegetable element can be toyed with a bit to accommodate whatever happens to be in season, but by definition kung pao chicken MUST contain one element, which of course is a wok fried peanut. And make no mistake, it is not kung pao chicken without peanuts, so we'll absolutely be touching on exactly how to dry toast a raw peanut for a stir fry. What is particularly unique about the PF Chang's kung pao chicken however, is that in lieu of the seared and flash cooked chicken thigh that we more commonly would use in most versions of this dish, today we'll instead be breading our chicken in potato starch, then deepfrying it to crispy, craggily bite sized pieces. So! This essentially means that we'll be using my favorite double breading technique with our chicken to create what is essentially a japanese chicken karaage...kung pao chicken, which is, very interesting. Hope you try it.

If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)\n* 2 tbsp white sugar\n* 1 1/2 tsp table salt\n\n*For Spicy Tuna*\n\n* 6-10 oz sushi quality tuna (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\n* 2 green onions\n* 1 tbsp sriracha sauce (1 tbsp is mild, use more as desired)\n* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil\n* 1 tsp soy sauce\n* 1/2 tsp white sugar optional, balances flavor\n* \\~1 tbsp chili crisp for topping, optional but strongly encouraged\n\n*To Finish Bowl:*\n\n* 1/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional\n* 1/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame ,optional\n* 1/2 cucumber, optional\n* other veggies such as carrots, onion, corn, nori, bean sprouts, etc (optional)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instructions**\n\n*For Sushi Rice:*\n\n1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The tuna and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.\n2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's \"prewashed\"). Drain as much water as possible.\n3. Add 1 3/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.\n4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.\n5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.\n6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely.\n7. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.\n\n*For Veggies:*\n\n1. Boil the edamame per package instructions (typically 3-4 minutes), then drain and season lightly with salt.\n2. Cut the cucumber into bite sized pieces as desired.\n3. Prepare the avocado last, as it will brown if exposed to air for too long. Peel and thinly slice the 1/2 avocado as desired.\n\n*For Spicy Tuna:*\n\n1. Rinse the tuna thoroughly, then pat dry with paper towels. Using a very sharp chef's knife, slice the tuna into strips. Once in strips, slice again into cubes. You do not need a sushi knife, a sharp chef's knife will do. I make my cubes about 1/2 inch in size, but choose any size you prefer.\n2. Remove the root tip of the green onions and discard, then slice as thinly as possible (green and white portions). After slicing, use your hands to separate the rings of the white portion as much as possible.\n3. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the cubed tuna, green onion, sriracha, sesame oil, soy sauce, and white sugar. Mix until fully combined. If not using immediately, cover and return to the fridge until ready to use.\n\n*For Finished Bowl:*\n\n1. Divide the sushi rice evenly into the serving dishes, creating a wide, flat base.\n2. Spoon the tuna into the serving bowls, then top with some chili crisp. Top with veggies as desired, then serve immediately with a spoon and chopsticks.", "Tip for avocado: don't bother peeling it.\n\nUse a spoon to extract or cut inside the skin.", "Poke", "When you get a sushi grade tuna steak sometimes it\u2019s not fully processed in the fact you you have to cut around sinew and tendon to get to the pure muscle of the fish.

Next time try removing pieces with all those white veiny tendons and the result will be the the pieces that are most tender and have no chewy bits in them.

Put your prepared potatoes into a bowl.\n\nStep 3: Seasoning the Potatoes\n\nNow, add the garlic powder, salt, and oil to the bowl and mix everything together. This seasoning will give our fries a savory, slightly garlicky flavor that\u2019s perfectly balanced with the fresh rosemary added later.\n\nStep 4: First Round of Air Frying\n\nPlace the seasoned potatoes in the air fryer. Set the temperature to 170 degrees Celsius (340 degrees Fahrenheit) and cook for 15 minutes. Remember to shake the fries halfway through to ensure even cooking. This is the first step of our twice-cooked method, which will give the fries their soft interior.\n\nStep 5: Second Round of Air Frying\n\nAfter 15 minutes, the fries should be soft and break in half easily. Shake them again and return them to the air fryer. This time, set the temperature to 195 degrees Celsius (385 degrees Fahrenheit) and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Shake them halfway through again. This second round of cooking is what gives the fries their irresistible crispy exterior.\n\nStep 6: Final Seasoning and Serving\n\nOnce your fries are done, transfer them to a bowl and season them with the chopped rosemary and an extra pinch of salt. Serve them immediately with your favorite dipping sauce. The result? Perfectly cooked fries that are soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and absolutely bursting with flavor.\n\n\nAnd there you have it! A simple, quick, and healthier way to enjoy fries at home. With the use of an air fryer and our twice-cooked method, you can enjoy this beloved snack without the guilt that often comes with deep-fried foods. If you try this recipe, we\u2019d love to hear how it turned out. Leave a comment below or share your air fryer fries on social media and tag us.

And if you want to [**subscribe to my Substack**](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/), I send new recipes out weekly.\n\nPreamble: So, I got my wisdom tooth removed and ended up with a lingual nerve injury, which means I can't taste very well. I decided to go back through my old favorite recipes and make them into videos. This is one of my favorites; I've had it many times. It's super easy and fast. You can use plain old canned green olives or try it with fancier Castelvetrano. I've done both, and they're both good.\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 1 pound baby gold potatoes, quartered\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 tablespoon piment d'Espelette or use 2 teaspoons paprika and 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* 15-ounce can of chickpeas\n* 5 cups water or stock (chicken, vegetable, or seafood)\n* 1 pound white fish, such as tilapia, cod, or whiting\n* 6-ounce can pitted Castelvetrano or green olives, halved\n* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Minced fresh parsley, lemon juice, or chives\n* Crusty bread\n\n**Cook the onion and potatoes:**\n\n1. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook for 2\u20133 minutes until they begin to sweat. Add the potatoes and cook, occasionally turning, for 6\u20138 minutes until they develop golden edges. Season all over with salt and pepper.\n\n**Prepare the broth:**\n\n1. Create a well in the middle of the pot and melt the butter. Once melted, add the piment d'Espelette and stir into the butter. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the butter. Cook for 45 seconds or until fragrant. Toss to coat the potatoes and onions in the mixture and cook for 3 minutes until the paste deepens in color. Add crushed red pepper to taste.\n2. Pour in the chickpeas and the water or stock. Season with salt and pepper (liberally, if using water) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are just shy of fork-tender.\n\n**Cook the fish:**\n\n1. Add the olives to the pot and stir to incorporate. Place the fish on top and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 8\u201310 minutes or until the fish is cooked and flakes easily with a fork. Depending on the thickness of the fish, you may need to simmer up to 12 minutes.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Before serving, gently break the fish up. Add parsley and lemon juice if you like. Ladle into bowls and garnish with more minced parsley or chives and serve a slice of crusty bread if you like. Enjoy!", "Castlevania Olives is a new one for me \ud83d\ude42", "Looks amazing.

Begin preheating the oven to 425\u00b0 F and spray a large rimmed baking sheet with oil.\n2. Season the chicken pieces with salt and fresh cracked black pepper and pour the panko out onto a wide plate. Working in batches, coat the chicken in the beaten egg then press into the panko to coat. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet as spaced out as possible.\n3. Spray the tops of the chicken pieces with oil. Place the chicken into the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, flip each piece and rotate the pan when you place it back into the oven. Bake for another 7-10 minutes until the chicken is crispy and cooked through.\n4. Meanwhile, on a separate baking sheet, toss the broccoli with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast in the oven for about 10 minutes, tossing halfway through, until crisp and charred in a few spots. OR, pan fry broccoli in a swirl of olive oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.\n5. While the chicken cooks, make the sauce. Combine the soy sauce and cornstarch in a small bowl and whisk until fully combined. Pour into a small saucepan, then add the rest of the ingredients for the sauce and mix well. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer until a thick sauce forms, about 5 minutes.\n6. Transfer the cooked chicken into a large mixing bowl, drizzle the sauce over the chicken and toss to coat (you may not want to use all of the sauce, so add it in steps until the chicken is coated to your liking). Add in the broccoli and toss to combine. Serve immediately topped with green onion, sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper. Great on a bed of white rice!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote- there\u2019s probably enough sauce here to scale up to about 1.5 lbs of chicken if desired!\n\nIf you make this recipe, I would love to hear how it turned out in the comment section!", "[deleted]", "This looks so good!", "My breaded chicken always comes out soggy.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to breakfast dim sum food classics with one of the more unique and interesting takes that I have come across to a Taiwanese \"cong you bing\" green onion pancake. For those unfamiliar, a cong you bing (or often colloquially, green onion or scallion pancake) is a small bite dish of Taiwanese origin that features a wildly simple dough of flour, water, and salt. The dough is then rolled, coiled, and rolled again to create its iconically flakey and delicate texture, which is perplexingly created without the use of butter, egg, baking soda, or any form of leavening agent whatsoever. \n\nSome may recall that this is certainly not our first attempt at a green onion pancake. A few months back, we did a version of a Shanghainese scallion flatbread leavened with baking powder, which, though similar in preparation, has a wildly different end result, as you might guess, because of its use of leavening agents. For our version today however, we're gonna first take a look at how to make a classic Taiwanese flaky cong you bing using literally nothing but flour, water, and salt. Then I also thought it would be fun to take a look at these \"Taiwan Tacos\" (made popular here in the bay by the pop up \"El Chino Grande\"), which essentially involves taking the green onion pancake, then rolling it up into a taco with a bit of rousong pork floss, egg, and Siracha aioli.

When hot, add the tofu and sear for 5 minutes on both sides until golden. Transfer the tofu to paper towels to drain.\n    \n4.  To the same pan, add the asparagus and a pinch of salt. Saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes until tender then remove from pan.\n    \n5.  Add the shallots and saut\u00e9 until softened. Stir in the capers, garlic and red pepper flakes and continue to saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Add the miso paste and lightly mash with the back of your spatula. Add the nutritional yeast and orzo then stir to coat.\n    \n6.  Pour in the broth and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently to prevent the orzo from sticking. Allow the orzo to cook for 10-12 minutes uncovered until the orzo is al dente. Once the orzo has absorbed most of the liquid, stir in the parsley, asparagus and remaining lemon juice and remove from heat.

If your recipe is only healthy because it includes a tablespoon of sugar but the video only says \"add sugar\" then the recipe isn't quite as healthy if the viewer guesses and adds 3 tablespoons. \n\nAlso little descriptions of why a substituted ingredient is healthy helps too.

If nothing else, it \"looks\" cleaner.", "As someone who loves roasted Brussels sprouts, the parmesan is totally unnecessary. Omitting it makes it a healthier option, though I can understand why someone would want it if they're new to it. \n\nThis opens the door to my tip to people who \"don't know how to cook\": learn a few simple sauces/glazes. Even a bottle of store bought balsamic glaze adds a ton of flavor, and you can use it sparingly. A flaky finishing salt could replace salt from the recipe. \n\nI would also recommend bumping up the temp a bit, at least 425.

Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese dim sum classics with a shot at a Chinese \"sticky fried rice,\" or glutinous fried rice. As the name implies, our dish today will be a fairly straight forward fried rice, which is to say, a wok stir fry featuring rice cooked directly in the wok with a handful of veggies and proteins. Our fried rice today however will have one unique addition, which is gonna be the inclusion of some glutinous sticky rice. For those unfamiliar, glutinous rice (or sometimes, sticky rice and/or sweet rice) while may appear to look like any other rice in its raw form, in fact has a much higher content of amylopectin starch than your more common jasmine or long grain rice, resulting in a \"sticky\" and tacky texture to its cooked form (as a sidenote, it does not contain any gluten, misleading as that might be). \n\nThough glutinous rice has a variety of uses all throughout Chinese cuisine (Some may recall the sticky rice \"zhongzi\" dumplings that we did not too long ago), the sticky fried rice that we're making today is popularly found as a small plate dish on dim sum carts for those seeking Chinese breakfast and/or brunch time snacks, which makes it a wonderful addition to the now growing list of dim sum recipes on this channel.

Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to TV and film with yet another addition to our growing collection of fried chicken recipes inspired by the Korean soy garlic fried chicken from All of us are Dead. As you might have noticed, our soon-to-be zombie high school kids are eating two different types of Korean fried chicken (or colloquially, \u201cKFC\u201d), both of which are very popular in Korea as well as here in the states. The first more bright red plate is a \u201cyang nyeum\u201d chicken iconically glazed with a korean gochujang chili paste, and for those looking, we did a version of this dish on the channel a few months back, here. \n\nSo! This means that for our attempts today, we\u2019ll be looking at this second plate of chicken, which is an equally popular \u201cdakgangjeong,\u201d or soy garlic fried chicken. For those unfamiliar, dakgangjeong is a korean sweet and savory fried chicken that employs the use of soy sauce, garlic, and honey to create its simultaneously sticky, sweet, and savory qualities. To pair with this, we\u2019ll also be using one of my favorite dry batters that makes use of corn starch, potato starch and baking soda to create the iconically extra crispy fried chicken wings that KFC is known for.

Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to classic Americanized Chinese cuisine with a look at the Chow Mein noodles from Panda Express. For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing classic dishes from Americanized chinese cuisine (not unlike the plethora of dishes from the Panda Express menu), then seeing what they might look like when reconstructed through the lens of more traditional wok cooking. \n\nIn more recent memory, this has tended to be really interesting to break down dishes like General Chicken or Bejing Beef, where the dish has no real foundation in Chinese cuisine (and instead really just originates from American cuisine), because frequently, we end up with wildly unique results. For our Chow Mein today however, obviously this dish has roots all throughout chinese cuisine, meaning that we are for the most part going to be taking a look at what makes Panda Express\u2019 chow mein unique (and make no mistake, it definitely is unique) before we construct our own attempt at the dish.

Slowly pour all of the boiled liquid into the mixing bowl with the eggs, while vigorously mixing.\u00a0Transfer mixing bowl contents back to the saucepan.\u00a0Continue to heat mixture on medium-low heat until thickened, whisking often to prevent lumps from forming.\n3. Remove cream from the heat. Add butter and whisk until melted.\u00a0Add a pinch of salt and vanilla. Cover surface with plastic wrap (to prevent skin from forming) and let cool completely.\n4. Cut a hole out of the centre of each cupcake. Remove cupcake lid and fill with 1 teaspoon of custard. Add the top of each cupcake lid back to the cupcake. Continue to make buttercream.\n\nChampagne Buttercream\n\n1. In a small saucepan/pot, bring champagne to a boil. Swirl mixture occasionally while allowing the champagne to reduce.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter on medium speed.\n3. Reduce speed to low and slowly add powdered sugar to the butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go.\n4. Once all powdered sugar has been incorporated, add the reduced champagne. Continue to mix the icing on medium speed until fluffy.

Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to foods from TV and film with a shot at the \u201cSecret Ingredient Soup\u201d or \u201cNiu Rou Mian\u201d from Kung Fu Panda. A few technicalities to address right off the bat before people lose their minds here. First, the soup that we\u2019re making today is a Taiwanese beef noodle soup known as \u201cniu rou mian.\u201d I am well aware that Kung Fu Panda technically takes place in China (not Taiwan), but\u2026it also features a talking goose and a panda doing kung fu, so, I\u2019ll allow it. Second (and maybe more important), Mr. Ping\u2019s secret ingredient soup features a very light colored broth, indicating to me that it\u2019s probably a vegetable stock. I imagine this is because the alternative would be a soup made out of animal broth, which is\u2026pretty horrifying. \n\nSo! instead, today we\u2019re making the closest thing that I can think of to a secret ingredient vegetable soup broth, which is gonna be a tomato-based soup broth known as niu rou mian. As you may have put together, a niu rou mian is a soup of Taiwanese origin that prominently features beef shank, slow simmered with a combination of Chinese aromatic spices, chili paste, and shaoxing wine to create a deeply rich and aromatic soup. to pair with this, a niu rou mian also iconically features the use of (secret ingredient time) tomato as the source of its acidity, to yield its uniquely rich and acidic qualities.
