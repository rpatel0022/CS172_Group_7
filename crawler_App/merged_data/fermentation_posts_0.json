It takes at least 6 months for the clear amber liquid to seperate from the rest of the liquified fish sludge, and you can easily skim patis off the top.\n\nThe brownish sludge that remains is also used as a condiment and cooking ingredient called bagoong na isda (fish paste).

Max recently posted a video about a honey glazed mushroom dish with the sauce that I might try, since the mushrooms are starting to pop up now.\n\nHe calls it garum, but since I didn't use the proper fish I call mine \"liquamen\", which means liquified fish in ancient greek", "Sorry for the wall of text, but here is the most interesting text I found about garum. It is a challenging ferment, but also a part of our history. \n\n\nGARUM\nInherited from the Greeks and initially considered a luxury for only the wealthiest Romans, garum was a common item throughout the Mediter- ranean region by the epoch of the Roman Empire. There were large garum- producing manufacturers all along the coast-at Pompeii, at Leptis Magna (in Libya), in southern Spain, at Clazomenae (Asia Minor), wher- ever saltworks and shops for preserving fish were located.\nNaturally, as for any product, there were various qualities of garum. But everyone, from emperor to slave, used this fish sauce as prevalently as soy sauce is used in Oriental cuisine.\nAncient sources contain countless recipes for the preparation of garum, also known as muria or liquamen. The most complete is provided by Gar- gilius Martialis, a writer from the third century A.D.\nUse fatty fish, for example sardines, and a well-sealed (pitched) container with a 26\u201335 quart / liter capacity. Add dried aromatic herbs possessing a strong flavor, such as dill, coriander, fennel, celery, mint, oregano, and others, making a layer on the bottom of the container; then put down a layer of fish (if small leave them whole, if large use pieces); and over this add a layer of salt two fingers high. Repeat these three layers until the container is filled. Let it rest for seven days in the sun. Then mix the sauce daily for twenty days. After that time it becomes a liquid (garum). (Gargilius Martialis,\nDe medicina et de virtute herbarum, 62)\nThis sauce must have been very salty, very strong and aromatic, certainly appealing to fish-lovers.\nThe most expensive garum was the so-called garum sociorum (garum for friends), made exclusively from mackerel and produced in southern Spain. The residue after any first-quality garum was obtained was then used to produce a secondary type called allec; and for the slaves there was a garum made from whatever entrails remained of the fish prepared for the household meal.\nThe fact that the Romans sometimes used fish entrails, and the idea that the containers were left for days in the sun for the fish to decompose, have encouraged a long-standing prejudice against the quality of Roman cuisine in general. Many later texts claim that the Romans enjoyed a sauce made of rotted fish organs, a description one would hardly consider appetizing. But in reality the fish were usually whole and the brine in which they were preserved apparently prevented them from putrefying. Instead the fermen- tation produced bacteria that gradually caused the fish to dissolve. This same process of fermentation is still in use for the preparation of many foods and beverages (such as wine, beer, vinegar, cheese, and yogurt), where it is hardly synonymous with putrefaction.\nGarum was usually purchased in large pre-packed amphoras and later mixed with other ingredients: thus there was oenogarum (garum with wine), hydrogarum (garum with water), and oxygarum (garum with vin- egar). There was also a garum castimoniale for Jews, in deference to bibli- cal dietary prescription, made only from \u201canimals with both fins and scales living in water\" (Leviticus 11:9-12); thus it was guaranteed to have used no mollusks, eels, and such, for its production. We know that Jews living on the Italian peninsula could obtain this particular garum, as is evidenced by fragments of amphoras found in Italy carrying inscriptions of their contents (cf. Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum 4, 2569 and 2609). Since nearly every recipe in Apicius contains garum, it is necessary for us either to make it or to find a suitable surrogate. However, readers who do not like fish need not be dismayed: even then there were those, such as Pliny, who disliked this sauce.", "I tried in 2022 with mackrel and the smell is not that bad in my opinion and after 1-2 weeks it smells more like fish oil.\nI forgot to stir it and it got mold on the top and has been forgotten on a shelf, I haven't noticed any smell, but I used a airtight seal.", "I have an unopened jar of unfiltered, fermented garum from a fermentation workshop a few years ago. I haven\u2019t opened it yet, and I\u2019m trying hard to find a good day to do so without drawing the attention of my entire neighbourhood. It might be just about rounding 3 years at this point", "I like Max Miller and all but I'm pretty sure I recall he did the ferment in a clear glass container (outside in the sun) - - I am pretty sure that's a No-No.\n\nEdit-- right, he put glass jars in the sun.. you know the Romans wouldn't have had those, and usually you don't want your ferments to be exposed to sunlight.", "My only question is, does it have to be mackerel?  Can it be another fish or a mixture of fish? I live near the Gulf of Mexico so there are a wide variety of fish I can catch for this. Could I use some of them to make this?\nExamples: Sheepshead, croker, catfish, red or black drum, trouts, flounder, bass.", "I'd try it, and apparently you can expedite the process to mere hours by pork pancreas to it.", "That is maybe a pretty good use for fish that have already started to go off?

I have made quick garums out of squid, bee pollen, and beef garum using enzyme supplements, but i never finished those because life got in the way. \n\nI am also making 2 fish sauces, one out of mackerel, the other out of sardines.

You can soak then in hot water and drink them for coughing, cook them into congee or use them to steam fish as a flavouring - many many culinary and medicinal purposes.\n\nTraditionally, many households pick mandarins during Chinese new year and pack them into jars with salt. Over the years, the liquid from the fruit will extract due to the salt and dissolve it. This is how the black colour develops. Many families have these jars of salt pickled fruits that are decades old if not more. These are passed on over generations as medical treasure.\n\nIn traditional local HK cafes, you may find pickled lemons/limes in coke or soda water as a special drink.

It also means that upon opening the jar there may be fizzing, bubbling, or even an explosion of kraut! IT\u2019S ALIIIIVE! \n\nWhile it can get messy at times, the fermented food is completely safe to enjoy.  \n\nWe recommend opening every jar of fermented food SLOWLY over a bowl in the sink to catch any of the brine that may spill out.  The kraut may even puff out of the jar 1-2 inches.  Again, totally normal.  Pack it back into the jar, pour the liquid back in and store in the fridge.

The flavor has totally transformed into something sweet, sour, and tender, and it spreads like butter. I\u2019ve never had anything like it.", "Oh boy, this is my jam. Not to dunk on the OP, but some clarifications:  \n  \n-It's perhaps more accurately referred to as \"torshi-e seer\" or less formally, \"seer torshi\". Seer=garlic, torsh=sour. You can make torshi out of anything, it's generally used as the catch-all term for \"pickle\".  \n  \n-As some others pointed out, there is no fermentation happening here, it's simply a vinegar pickle. If i had to guess as to what's going on, it's maybe a veeery slow conversion of the natural sugars in the garlic. Perhaps similar to caramelizing onions? There may also be some evaporation of the liquid at play here over these long time scales, since the level of vinegar will noticeably decrease and it will become more viscous.  \n  \n-I have a few jars currently going and use one as the \"tester\", which I take a sample of every 6 months. I've been eating this my whole life and here is how it generally breaks down in my experience:  \n   0-2 years: nothing too exciting yet, still sharp garlic and vinegar flavor with crunchy texture. Don't bother making if you can't wait longer than this honestly.  \n   2-4 years: beginning to taste like traditional seer torshi. The pickling liquid is noticeably darker, and the garlic is beginning to get soft. Some sweetness and other new flavors start to develop.  \n  4-10 years: when it truly comes into its own. The garlic is soft and beginning to be spreadable, the liquid is dark and viscous, and the overall flavor is more sweet and getting sweeter with time. I've tasted all kinds of fun things in a fully mature seer torshi, like chocolate and caramel notes.  \n  10+ years: the garlic is basically mush as seen in the OP, with very sweet flavor. After 10 years, not much seems to change in my experience. Still totally delicious though.  \n  \n-As for safety: this is just straight vinegar, no dilution, so nothing can grow in it. Everyone's got their own comfort levels, but you would know if it went off. On the contrary, many Persian grandmas have claimed that a 10 year old torshi will cure you of any ailment!  \n  \n-There really isn't anything to making this other than filling a jar with garlic and covering it with vinegar. White, ACV, any kind of vinegar really. You can add salt if you like. After 4 years none of that really matters, the flavor of the pickled garlic will probably overshadow any additions or other choices. Someone else posted a recipe that mentioned honey and barberries, something that my mother would affectionately refer to as \"chert-o-pert\" (aka \"nonsense\" or perhaps less generously, \"bullshit\"). But hey, pickling is all about experimenting so you can put whatever sounds cool in your seer torshi. Make a jar anytime you have something to celebrate - weddings, graduation, new house, remembering to put on pants today, etc.", "[deleted]", "Receiving a few comments about recipe/method. I asked my mom, and she says that she just put a bunch of washed and dried garlic in a jar (you can either peel everything down to the clove, or just carefully remove the \u201cpapery\u201d skin and leave the head intact) and covered them with apple cider vinegar.

To address a few common themes I see in these comments:\n\n* Many people are suggesting alternative sources of CO2 or other gasses that like argon or nitrogen that will serve the same purpose. All your ideas are great, and would definitely work. Especially something like [wine preserving spray](https://www.amazon.com/Private-Preserve-Wine-Preservation-Spray/dp/B0000DCS18), which is basically designed to do exactly this. Credit /u/jimbojonesonham\n* Several folks are under the impression that I put baking soda + vinegar *into* the ferment. I should stress that I just poured the CO2 gas off the top.\n* Several people are asking why I've elected not to use an airlock. This really comes down to personal preference. This would be a perfectly good application for an airlock lid. This ferment (unless it is too spicy, which it may be) will probably get going quickly enough that most oxygen would be expelled through an airlock sufficiently quickly to keep any mold from appearing. However, the airlock strategy comes at the cost of being able to *actively* release gas once or twice a day (i.e. \"burp\" the ferment), which, in my experience, is indispensable as a proxy for the progress of the ferment. Whenever I decide a lactic acid ferment is \"ready\", it isn't because some set amount of time has passed, but because of the amount of activity I can perceive by way of continual burping. Ferments are sensitive to temperature and initial conditions, to the extent that you can't always expect a given ferment \"recipe\" to take X amount of days. For me, airlocks introduce too much guesswork into lactic acid ferments. That said, I do appreciate them for any ferment that involves significant sugar and especially yeast. These ferments often go longer, and produce TONS of gas - enough to give you a visible sense of progress, and enough to otherwise blow up your mason jar. I will go for the airlock in these cases.", "Super cool! Thanks for sharing!", "Seltzer would accomplish the same thing.", "Very clever. On the same note, there is a product marketed for preserving opened bottles of wine the same way, it\u2019s just a can of co2 with a very skinny straw.

Shout out from Columbus!", "Absolutely brilliant. I\u2019m a food scientist and never even considered doing this. Impressive af man", "I always thought a small piece of dry ice would work well. That or an argon tank.", "You can also do this with a sodastreamer or any gas container you can \"purge\" the headspace with.", "Is this something that can be done in any ferment as an added safeguard to mold forming on the surface?\n\nedit: thank you for sharing this!", "I love the idea, but I'm not sure that the gassed pour as readily as you might think. Yes c02 is heavier than air, but with any small amount of turbulence they're going to mix together rather than the c02 just displacing the 02. You'll end up with a higher concentration of c02 in your headspace but there will still be 02 in there.", "This is amazing information and thank you so much for sharing!!!", "Great idea and video!  You could do that with a co2 too tank if you have one handy but this actually seems easier. \n\nOne question: why not use an air lock?  I see lots of people on here that \"burp\" their ferments instead of using an air lock.  Is there an advantage to doing it that way?", "what a great video, \n\n\ni was hoping for your recipe!", "exceptionally brilliant idea", "What a cool and informative video. Awesome work.", "if it\u2019s such an active fermentation, why not just throw a one-way valve on top and let the 02 get pushed out?", "Super duper helpful!!! Thank you ! Will do this on my next ferment . :)", "Bro... you are fucking brilliant \ud83d\udc4f take my upvote.", "\"Burp me father, I'm getting all tasty for you.\"", "Cool video!\n\nGlad to see someone demonstrating the importance of oxygen removal in the early phases of an anaerobic ferment.\n\nI see so many posts with kahm yeast and mold with suggestions on how to resolve it almost always revolving around salt increases or weighing things down.\n\nI much prefer solid-state ferments over brine ferments.\n\nAnd for anyone reading who is interested, a brine ferment is when you leave everything in big chunks and make a salty brine and weigh everything underneath it.\n\nIn a brine ferment, the sugars from whatever you're fermenting are less likely to leech heavily into the brine, and therefore the brine won't become a viable food source for yeast and mold on the surface so long as everything is submerged.\n\nWith a solid state ferment, the brine is formed naturally through osmosis from adding salt to your vegetables. This means the 'brine' is rich with fermentable sugars and way more available to mold and yeast on the surface -- so long as oxygen is present.\n\nI often use my food saver jar-sealing attachment at the beginning of a ferment to start the ferment off under vacuum -- it still retains oxygen, but it is much more quickly displaced as CO2 is formed.\n\nFor anyone interested, I post a bunch of my experiments to [my instagram](https://instagram.com/natesantichen)", "Is grocery store salsa fermented?

Too elongate their stems, they get trapped in their own CO2 and whatever else gases they produce.

The end result is a little different (a bit smokier) but just as good.\n\nNoma makes theirs by combining cremini mushrooms, koji, and salt then leaving it at 140\u00b0F for 6-8 weeks. Then they cold-smoke the finished liquid. I wanted to make mine in just a couple days, so I leveraged two hacks I've posted about here before: one for expedited fermentation and another for expedited aging: \n\n1. **Expedited fermentation**: Noma uses koji to ferment their garum, but I use pork pancreas instead. The enzymes in pork pancreas are much more plentiful than the enzymes in koji, so they get the job done in a fraction of the time and and impart no discernible taste. Even better, powdered, freeze-dried pork pancreas is sold as a dietary supplement, so it is easy to acquire and inexpensive.\n\n2. **Expedited aging**: Noma ages their garum for 6-8 weeks at 140\u00baF,  but I\u2019ve found that aging is actually a flavor you can **add** to sauces. In other words, I outsource my aging! Blending the garum with blackened koji or even store-bought black garlic will simulate the aging process in a fraction of the time.\n\nI also deviated from the Noma recipe by (1) using fresh foraged morels instead of cremini and (2) smoking the morels in an ibushi gin donabe instead of cold-smoking it at the end.\n\nAll together, you can make this in just a couple days (including the process of clarifying the garum).

Prepared in many varieties that differ across Poland and every household. The flavour is complex and unique, thanks to the fermented Rye starter that works as the main ingredient. Once you try it you will love it just like I do :)\n\n**How to prepare \u017burek?**\n\nFirst of all, to make \u017burek you need to prepare the starter, it is simple and it doesn't require maintenance but it takes 5-7 days to ferment. You can also buy the premade version in European supermarkets but the flavour will not be as good as a homemade version.\n\nThis recipe makes 6 portions\n\n**Ingredients for the starter:**\n\n\\* 500ml (0.52 quart) bottled or boiled water at room temperature (no chlorine)\n\n\\* 5tbsp rye flour (you can use wholemeal wheat flour as well)\n\n\\* 5 garlic cloves, peeled and slightly crushed\n\n\\* 4 bay leaves\n\n\\* 10 allspice berries\n\n**Ingredients for the soup:**\n\n\\* 1,5 litre (1.58 quart) of vegetable bullion\n\n\\* 500ml (0.52 quart) of \u017burek starter\n\n\\* 4 small pork sausages (you can also add smoked sausage)\n\n\\* 250g (8.8oz) uncut smoked bacon (boczek)\n\n\\* 1tsp marjoram\n\n\\* 3 tsp of double cream (soured cream works too)\n\n\\* Salt to taste\n\n**To serve:**\n\n\\* Boiled diced potatoes\n\n\\* Hard-boiled eggs cut in half\n\n\\* Sourdough Bread\n\n\\* Fresh parsley or dill\n\n\\* Cracked black pepper\n\n**Instructions for the starter:**\n\n1.For the preparation of the starter, you need to use water without chlorine as it kills the microbes, simply boil the water first and let it cool down to room temperature.\n\n2.Put all the starter ingredients into a clean jar and stir with a spoon to combine.\n\n3.Cover the jar with a paper towel or a cloth and tie the top (this helps the starter to breathe).\n\n4.Place the jar at room temperature away from the direct sunlight. After around 5-7 days your starter is ready to use. You can use it straight away or store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks (if you keep it in the fridge remove and discard spices from the starter, if you use it straight away you can add it as it is).\n\n**Instructions for the bullion:**\n\n1.To Prepare vegetable bullion combine 1L of water with a couple of diced carrots, 2 medium onions, a piece of celery and leek. Bring to the boil then reduce to simmer with a lid on the pot, set the timer for 1 hour.\n\n2.Once the bullion is ready, separate the liquid from the vegetables (I keep carrots for the soup and discard everything else).\n\n**Instructions for the soup:**\n\n1.Dice bacon and pan-fry on high heat for 4-5 minutes to render the fat.\n\n2.To the hot stock add fried bacon, cooked carrots, whole or sliced sausages, 1tsp of marjoram and bring to boil then simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n3.Whisk Zurek starter and pour into the soup, simmer until soup thickens.\n\n4.Take the soup off the heat and remove sausages, slice and place back in the pot.\n\n5.Put the cream in the bowl and add a ladle of the soup, mix it together and pour it back into the pot (this prevents the cream from curdling).\n\n6.Serve \u017burek with hard-boiled eggs and fresh sourdough bread.\n\nSmacznego!\n\n**Insight:**\n\n\\- You can add 1tbsp of grated horseradish to the soup, it works fantastic.\n\nBlog post: [\u017burek recipe](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/%C5%BCurek)", "This is my favorite soup!

You're probably familiar with fish sauce, a type of garum.\n\nGarum typically takes 4 months or more to make, but I posted earlier this week about a [method I discovered for making garum in just 3 hours by hacking dietary supplements](https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/lj41py/shrimp_garum_made_in_just_3_hours_using_dietary/). One advantage of this insanely fast method is rapid iteration. I've now produced *and* clarified shrimp garum, beef garum, bee pollen garum, and chicatana ant garum \u2014 all since Friday.\n\nBy far, the chicatana ant garum is the best of them all. I learned about chicatana ants while in Mexico. They're a fairly large ant that is dried in Oaxaca and sold elsewhere in Mexico. They taste like a mix of coffee and chocolate, so restaurants like Pujol use them for seasoning. I bought them from Masienda in LA.\n\nTurned into garum, the chicatana ants have the deepest hot chocolate flavor. I really can't believe how cool it tastes. Totally elevating the flavor and making it more versatile for other dishes.\n\nTrying an oyster garum tonight!\n\nEdit: detailed recipe [here](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/all/3-hour-garum-recipe), but for ants I used 2x the ant's weight in water\n\nEdit 2: Many people have been asking me if they can modify this recipe.

Guys thanks so much for your interest!\nHere's a small intro and answers to your main questions. \nI'll be editing this comment to include answers to new questions. \nA small intro:\nI've tried this once with some spicy gherkins fermented in 3% brine, turned out pretty good but too much raw pumpkin flavor. The pumpkin was a little soft after that, i tried to cook some Ghapama (an Armenian dish consisting of rice and dried fruit stuffed pumkin baked in oven) in that pumpkin but it kinda fell apart.\nThe previous pumpkin was a bit too ripe in my opinion so this time a went with a firmer and younger one. Also I'll make sure it'll have  air circulation at the bottom so it'll not get too soft. \n\nTo balance the raw pumpkin flavor i roasted some of the pulp in a cast iron skilled and added to the ferment.\n\nI fermented the gherkins for 5 days so mold and yeast wasn't that much of an issue, but this time I'm planning to ferment the sauce for 2 weeks and it can get nasty. \nTo counteract on it i plan to do the following (not shown in picture because i ran out of beeswax and need to buy some tomorrow): drill an airlock to the \"lid\" and seal everything with beeswax. I think I'll even do a layer on the outer shell to try to stop the pumpkin from decaying from contact with oxygen.\nThis way there'll be no oxygen, i.e. no mold or Kahm yeast inside (in theory). \n\nAs I'm planning on sealing the vessel for 2 weeks, I'll be able to only provide updates about what's going on on outside of the pumpkin. \nAnd a great reveal on 17th if everything goes smoothly, and if everything goes super smooth I'll throw in a Ghapama recipe inside a fermented pumpkin. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions you have.\n\nUpdate, day 8: Sad news everyone, well not very sad but still. I was doing a checkup on the pumpkin, picked it up pushed with my finger a bit to check how well the walls hold up and the wall just crumbled. The pumpkin wasn't usable anymore so i cut it up and moved it to my eJen fermentation vessel. \nThere's some mold on the \"lid\" part but nothing of concern on the ferment itself.\nGonna provide a more analytical update tomorrow,it's 3AM here\n\nUPDATE Day 16:\nHey Guys, Got kinda busy and wasn't able to update you on the progress.\nOn day 8 I picked the pumpkin up to inspect it and check for mold and softness. I may have pressed a little bit harder than I needed and the outer shell collapsed under my finger.\nThinking that everything happens for good - i opened the pumpkin up to see what's going on inside, and boy was i right to do so.\nThe \"lid\" part was covered in white mold, despite the beeswax, but nothing near the ferment or the ferment itself.\nThe ferment didn't smell funny, so i decided to transfer it to my eJen container and continue fermenting it. It wasn't very active (not sure if that's a bad sign, but again - no funny smell). I blended the sauce today and the taste was good, I could taste pumpkin very clearly (more on the raw side, although grilling some of the pulp and mixing countered that), the taste was good, certainly unique.\n\nSome sidenoted: The pumpkin was most fragile in the parts that was not submerged in brine, the parts of pumpkin submerged were almost as sturdy as day 1. I think next time i'll try to do something to submerge all parts of the pumpkin, lid included to counteract mold and rot.\n\nAnyway it was a fun project, will try something like this again!\n\nSome photos: https://imgur.com/a/H9WPq8Z", "Can we get daily updates? Pretty pretty please with kahm yeast on top?", "Interesting container choice. Have you done this before?

{"title": "Hot Sauce Update Update", "selftext": "So here\u2019s the final-ish update on that 2 kg of peppers I fermented a few weeks back. \n\nI decided to clear out my freezer and my brother gave me peppers and I picked a bunch from my yard. I put them all together with a little over 2% salt by weight and vacuum bagged them. It was an eclectic mix of peppers: bells, jalape\u00f1os, fresnos, cayennes, serranos, habaneros, anaheims, whatever was around. \n\nAfter fermenting for a few days, it inflated to the point of needing urgent venting. To my surprise, it fully inflated again, needing venting. Then it inflated again! If you look you can see that the last one isn\u2019t very fully inflated. At this point I needed some time to process. \n\nYesterday I had that time. I also opened two other bags sitting on the counter for a couple months. The cayennes were fairly recent but my habanero bag was pretty old. It had really broken down the cells and was very liquid. And pretty funky. At first I thought it had gone bad, but then I realized it was funk. A bit much for me, but I blended it in anyway. \n\nFor blending, I did that in batches and still over filled my 8-cup measuring cup. \n\nI then strained it all through a sieve with a spoon and mixed it up to blend the flavors. I added about 1.5 tsp of Xanthan gum (bag said I should use 3 tsp for that volume if I was making salad dressing) to keep the liquids separating from the solids. \n\nAfter bottling, I ran out of time for the pulp. So today I added three limes worth of juice to make my own Tajin, and then spread it on the dehydrator on pieces of parchment paper to dry.

Here's what I've found.\n\n1) yes, technically this is a type of pellicle.\n\n\"Pellicles are biofilms which form at an air-liquid interface to take advantage of the higher oxygen concentrations in this environment.\"\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416687/\n\n2) pellicles and SCOBY are both a type of biofilm. Plaque is also a biofilm, as is Mother of Vinegar. And also the pink ring that forms around my bathtub drain. A biofilm is not inherently good or bad, but depends on the context.\n\n3) a biofilm is basically what happens when a bunch of different microbes team up to form a bunch of extracellular structures to live in together.\n\n\"the biofilm is almost invariably a multispecies microbial community harboring bacteria that stay and leave with purpose, share their genetic material at high rates, and fill distinct niches within the biofilm. Thus, the natural biofilm is less like a highly developed organism and more like a complex, highly differentiated, multicultural community much like our own city.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC101960/\n\n4) ergo, it is unlikely that anyone's growing *one* species at the top of their fermentation.\n\n5) so what is Kahm? Well it's technically not a single species. This is from a scientific article btw:\n\n\"The presence of oxygen in the headspace of plastic barrels favors the formation of microbial films on the surface of the brine. The films, also known as yeast kahm or flor, consist of an aggregation of oxidative yeasts, molds, bacteria and polymers.\"\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404718/\n\n6) the article is actually about how to prevent the growth of Kahm/a biofilm on top of lacto fermented olives because it is a sign the quality of the ferment is deteriorating.\n\n\"Formation of films of molds and yeasts on the surface of brine is a spoilage factor, since it can worsen the quality of the product. Oxidative yeasts residing in the biofilms can metabolized lactic and acetic acid under aerobic conditions, reducing brine acidity and increasing pH, which can allow the growth of others undesirable microorganisms with the consequent loss of product quality and reduced food safety [13,14].\"\n\nSee also, a similar article about preventing biofilm formation on Sichuan pickles:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10137390/\n\n7) I don't know as much about brewing beer or whether/when a biofilm is beneficial in that situation, but it seems that the general food production consensus is that it's undesirable in lacto-fermented vegetables.\n\n8) where does the word \"Kahm\" even come from? I don't have a subscription to the Oxford English Dictionary for a definitive answer, but this blog post has decent sourcing from historic documents that suggest \"Kahm\" is a German brewer's word for the biofilm/pellicle/whatever dating back to before 1898. \n\nhttps://multicultured.org/kahm-yeast-kahm/\n\ntl;dr it doesn't seem to matter if you call it Kahm or pellicle or a biofilm, although I think it's worth pointing out that it's not a single species of yeast. (And may include other types of microorganisms, although Candida and Pischia are both yeasts frequently found in Kahm.)\n\n\"Kahm\" appears to be an old German word to describe a pellicle or biofilm, possibly originating or at least popularized among German brewers.\n\nOn lacto fermented vegetables, Kahm tends to produce undesirable flavors and may potentially raise the pH of the fermentation (leading to spoilage).", "Kahm yeast. Scrape it off and dispose of it asap because mold can use it as a life raft.", "It\u2019s a pellicle u/kwalijke ignore the hippies calling it \u201cKahm yeast\u201d, that\u2019s not real science. It\u2019s likely a mix of yeast and bacteria. It isn\u2019t dangerous, it won\u2019t kill you or harm you in anyway. It\u2019s often seen in mixed fermentations, no one is 100% sure why it forms but the leading theory is the microbes are trying to get oxygen out the air. Try and leave it undisturbed as it\u2019s actually creating a barrier helping to prevent oxidation.\n\nThe best resource for learning more is to google \u201cmilk the funk pellicle wiki\u201d.

I don't know how much longer you plan to let it go, but try not to disturb the pellicle until you're ready to transfer/use the liquid. The pellicle provides a barrier against oxygen absorbed on the liquid surface. Lower oxygen means less 'vinegar-y' acetic acid and more lactic acid production generally. If you want to make spicy vinegar you could remove it (sanitarily).

Even weak acids can dissolve certain glazes over the time periods used for a good fermentation. Safety is important.\n\nThere are a couple of really simple methods for testing the robustness and suitability of your food safe ceramics.\n\nThe first is to squeeze some lemon juice on a glazed area of your project and then place the rest of the lemon on to the ware, leaving it at least overnight, but 2-3 days is recommended. Then remove the lemon and rinse the ware; if the color of the glaze has changed then this indicates that the glaze is not sufficient for foodstuffs. If this glaze were to be used for functional work, even the acid in a cup of coffee could cause similar leaching, creating a beverage or ferment that's now fortified with a number of unwanted and potentially hazardous materials. It\u2019s important to note that if your glaze passes this test, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that materials aren\u2019t leaching out of the glaze at all, just that they aren\u2019t leaching badly. Check again after a long ferment to see if discoloration is present.\n\nThe second test is to test your work in a microwave. Fill your ware with water and place in the microwave for 1 minute. If the glaze is insufficient or poorly anchored/contains bubbles/voids, unglazed spots then the ware will absorb the water and the work will become very hot. The water may also cause cracking of the glaze if it is not sufficient. If the clay body isn\u2019t sufficiently vitrified, the water will absorb into the surface of the work and become very hot. The expansion of this water into steam when heated can compromise the bond between the clay and glaze, causing the glaze to chip off. The thermal shock of hot water may also cause cracking if there\u2019s a misfit in the thermal expansion of the glazes on the clay, such as a tight liner on the inside and a crazed matte on the outside. \n\nAlso, it should be noted that some glazes, including lusters and other metallics, will cause sparking in a microwave and should be labeled as such when being sold or gifted.\n\nUltimately, there are a number of elements that add up to a food safe ceramic piece. Glaze is perhaps the key element as this ensures that not only does the food not come in contact with any potential harmful substances, but also ensures that the ceramic ware is robust, lasts for a long time and ultimately is suitable for its intended purpose.", "Beautiful!

The best way to remove the excess membrane from the beans is with koji powder (again open to air) and the koji eats away at the membrane further fermenting the bean.

Imagine: you seem to be eating fresh apples, but you understand that something has been done to them.  They crunch, but a little less, they are slightly salty and pleasantly pinch the tongue.

I did it for 2 primary reasons to start.  1) to try to secure my food by preserving it for longer storage times because covid made supply and distribution lines unreliable.  And 2) if I preserve or produce some of my own food supply,  I don't waste as much food because I'm not making more than I need,  and things I don't use as much can last longer so I'm more likely to use them before they go bad which saves money.  I later learned a added benefit to this.  I was diagnosed a few years ago with hoshimotos thyrioditis,  a auto immune disease. Looking back,  I've shown minor symptoms as early as 6 yrs old ( I'm 34 now). My health was on a downward spiral,  the symptoms were debilitating,  as I could not regultate my eating,  blood sugar,  and had almost constant migraines to name a few symptoms. My Dr had me on multiple meds that did not help. I found some research saying adding probiotics foods could help over time. I experimented on myself. The difference over the past 6 months is night and day. The symptoms aren't gone,  but ate greatly reduced. I will admit,  for a while,  I did exceed recommended dosages until I showed signs that things were properly regulating and the excess was no longer benificial. Then,  I cut back to a lower dosage to keep a therapeutic dosage level. I know I'm treating a dietary change of holistic medicine like a modern med. But,  in this case that's what it is. I'm not anti meds,  I'm pro what works. Some things are better treated with herbs or dietary changes.  Some things are treated better with a combo pack of meds and herbal medicine.  Some things can't be treated by anything but modern meds. My auto immune issue was not improving with modern medication,  it was only getting worse. Fermented foods gave me my ability to function back."]}

This will allow the mycelium to better penetrate and break down more of the substrate, creating more umami flavors and a more pleasant texture.\n\n- Don't skip the 20 minute cooling/drying process, excess moisture will create a looser loaf and not allow the mycelium to grow properly.\n\n- Use a glass container with cling wrap pressed closely to the surface of the beans. Poke a few holes on the cling wrap too. This gives the tempeh a much nicer, smoother appearance (in my pic, the top part you're seeing is the bottom).\n\n- Increase fermentation time if mycelium isn't fully mature in the typical 48 hours. A good indicator of full maturity is if you can start to see a few tiny black dots near the surface. This batch took me 65 hours (almost 3 days) bc of inconsistent temperatures in my ice chest with heating pad. I'm still a newbie, and I read the spores start to form around 60 hours which explains why, in a commercial setting I think they do 48 hours to keep it totally white for consistency sake.

{"title": "Making Slivovitz on the Balkans: The First Step - Fermentation", "selftext": "Hello everyone! \nI wanted to share with you the process my family and I use to make slivovitz, a traditional alcoholic drink here on the Balkans.\n\nWe typically gather around 500 kilograms of plums, though some families in the area harvest over 2,000-3,000 kilograms! We\u2019ve just finished picking the ripe plums, and we\u2019ve carefully crushed them and placed them in a large vat, where they\u2019ll stay for the next few weeks to ferment. This stage is crucial, as the natural sugars in the plums will start converting into alcohol.\n\nOnce the fermentation process is complete, we\u2019ll move on to distillation. Distillation is where the magic happens\u2014it\u2019s the process that concentrates the alcohol content. The fermented plum mash, called \"mash\" or \"must,\" is heated in a copper still, which we also affectionately call the \"veseli stroj\" (the \"merry machine\"). As it heats up, the alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature than water. These alcohol vapors are then collected and condensed back into liquid form through a cooling coil.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail on the distillation process:\n\n**Prvenac** - This is the first distillate that comes out of the still. It contains high levels of volatile compounds and is of poor quality, so it needs to be discarded. Generally, for every 100 liters of mash in the still, the first 2-5 dcl that comes out is known as \"prvenac.\" Some people save it and use it in the next distillation, but our advice is: \"What wasn't good the first time, won't be good the second time either!\"\n\n**Srce rakije (meka rakija)** - This is what we\u2019re looking for! The highest quality rakija distillate comes right in the middle, and it contains all the desired aromas and flavors. After discarding the \"prvenac,\" we allow the \"srce\" to flow into a container and adjust it to the desired alcohol level (measured in \"gradi\"). \nThe rakija that comes out every 5-10 minutes will have a lower alcohol content as the process continues. We measure the alcohol level about every 20 minutes, and once we reach the desired strength, we set it aside and move on to the final distillate, known as \"patoka.\" The best quality rakija is typically in the range of 25-35 gradi, but this is up to you.\n\n**Patoka**, like \"prvenac,\" is not the best quality rakija and is generally best discarded and not used.\n\nThe quality and strength of the slivovitz depend on careful control of the temperature during distillation. Our final product can range from 25% to 50% alcohol, but someone makes it even higher, depending on the process and the specific characteristics of the plums and the mash.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re in the fermentation stage, waiting for the process to finish. If you\u2019re interested in how this continues, drop a comment below, and I\u2019ll keep you updated on the distillation and the final results!\n\nThanks for your support, and I\u2019m excited to share this traditional process with you all!\n", "url": "https://v.redd.it/rgx75sri4vkd1", "created_utc": 1724614583.0, "score": 408, "author": "endless_seeker_42", "num_comments": 66, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1f14tc9/making_slivovitz_on_the_balkans_the_first_step/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["First step is actually gumboots", "So the plums don't go into any kind of liquid and you're not adding yeast?

Tempeh should be cooked, but natto can be eaten raw (put it on some bread or something to cut the sharp flavor), at least according to Sandor Katz.\n\nFollow the instructions and keep an eye on the temperature. The ideal temp for tempeh is 88F and natto likes 100-104F. Buy some good quality natto and tempeh spores. Take the prescribed amount of spores and mix it with 2-3x the amount of rice flour. This helps spread the spores more evenly and the rice flour will also get fermented.

I've made successful tempeh, using the same starter, with both soybeans and chickpeas. Pinto beans are too soft.\n\nNatto is easiest to cook the beans in a pressure cooker, since it only takes I think 30 minutes, otherwise it's a 6-hour cook on the stovetop.\n\nUnless you're a savage, DON'T eat natto plain. It's disgusting! But mixed into another dish, added just before serving, is wonderful. My favorite is eggs, rice and about 1/4 cup (or less) of natto.

If its ginger beer, I add some non-fermentable sugar like splenda or xylitol, and some lemon juice, before priming.

I rack my 23L carboy into a clean 23L carboy and thoroughly mix 500ml of simple syrup into that. I then siphon the mix into my bottles and seal them up. I keep them in a warm room for about a week, you can burp a bottle or two just to check if its too much, if you fully fermented in your carboy or other fermenter that should be fine though. \n\nFYI I am not a professional and this is not necessarily the normal way to do this, its just the way I do it and I thought it may be helpful to give a suggestion of something that works for me.\n\nAll the best and glad you didn't get hurt!", "That doesn't seem like straight ginger beer", "What the hell?!

Cover, reduce the heat, and boil for 20 minutes. Strain, squeezing the solids to extract as much wort as possible. Add the sugar, ginger powder, and cream of tarter to the wort and stir until completely dissolved. Divide between two 1-gallon fermenters and add enough water to yield a mostly-full gallon. Cool to 70\u00b0F, then pitch the yeast (for wild yeast starters, use a 1/2 cup), airlock, and ferment for 3\u20137 days before bottling*.\n\n## Notes\n* 3\u20137 days of fermentation is just a guess at this point.

Some cultures traditionally also used semi-porous earthenware crocks that were unglazed (ie Korean onggi for kimchi) that allowed the exchange of gasses.

If you have a butcher that sells very lean rat, you can use that too.\n2. Combine with koji, salt, and water and mix thoroughly\n3. Place some plastic wrap on the surface to keep it from being exposed to air\n4. Place in your fermentation chamber and keep it at 140f for 8-10 weeks, until it tastes like what you\u2019re looking for.\n5. Stir it daily for the first week and skim off any fat.  After a week you can probably go to every other day.  Whenever you see fat, skim it off (fat is the enemy of a good rat garum)\n6. Once done, strain the liquids from the solids.  You can dehydrate the solids to use as a umami packed seasoning.\n7.

Arm yourself with a couple of oversize bowls, a kraut cutter (either the old-fashioned large box kraut cutter or a smaller modern mandoline), a scale, and a 2-gallon or larger crock or bucket.  \n2. Wash the crock with hot soapy water, rinse it well with boiling water, and let it air-dry.  \n3. Cut the cabbage into quarters, and starting at the tips, cut it into shreds the width of a nickel. Shred until you get down to the core. Weigh out 5 pounds of shredded cabbage, put it in the crock, and then add the pickling salt. Mix with your hands until the salt is fully incorporated.  \n4. Pack down the surface of the cabbage and wipe the sides of the crock with a clean cloth. Cover the top of the cabbage either with large cabbage leaves (those taken from the outside of a head are best) or with a clean plate that fits inside the crock. Fill each of three freezer-weight self-seal gallon-size bags halfway with a simple brine\u20141 tablespoon salt to 1 quart water\u2014and seal the bags. Set them on top of the cabbage leaves or plate.  \n5. Cover the crock with a light towel and store it at cool room temperature (65\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F) for a minimum of 7 days and as long as a couple of months. Begin checking your kraut after 7 days. You want to stop it from fermenting further when it tastes good to you. I generally like it best after it has gotten frankly sour, when it is 2 to 3 weeks old.  \n6. Some people can and water-bath process their sauerkraut, but that kills its living probiotic juices.

Etc.\n\nLong version:\n\nI hope this post makes any sense to the community, I know most of us have some experience as an amateur or in some cases professional fermenters, so I was wondering if anyone has recommendations about how to achieve different effects in fermented spicy sauce recipes (tips for non-fermented versions or variations are welcome!). \n\nAllow me to explain, in the particular case of spicy sauce we all know that the spicy sauce's organoleptic characteristics might vary according to the ingredients the recipe includes or the process used. Sadly I have seen many posts being a little vague in the way they describe their final product and if you have ever checked the /hotsauce community you will notice the same issue. Also, spicy sauce naming conventions do not help since almost every sauce is related to well-common tropes like \"hell XYZ\", \"bu\\*\\*hole destroyer 3000\", \"the last xxx\", \"the bomb\", \"nuclear xyz\", and the likes or even some eye rolling names such as \"Sauce wars: The Curry awakens\".\n\nAnyway, rant over. While I know the Scoville scale exists and many products put some kind of \"meter\" to the heat level, this does not reflect on other characteristics that the sauce might have like \"lingering effect\", \"sensation\", \"mouthfeel\" and the likes. Therefore, I brainstormed the next table describing in more detail some other aspects I have found in some sauces:\n\n|Characteristic|What It Means|Example|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Heat Level (HL)**|How spicy it is. (The most basic metric)|Jalape\u00f1o (mild), Habanero (hot)|\n|**Burn Speed (BS)**|How fast the heat hits. (Some hit you as soon as they hit your mouth)|Wasabi (fast), Ghost Pepper (slow)|\n|**Burn Duration (BD)**|How long the burn lasts. (Some hit like a truck but dissipate very fast while others linger for a very very long time)|Jalape\u00f1o (short), Habanero (long)|\n|**Stacking Effect (SE)**|Gets hotter with each bite. (Heat stacks, might start mild but it might stack to barely tolerable levels)|Sichuan oil, Korean gochujang|\n|**Mouth Feel (MF)**|Type of sensation. (Usually non capsaicin ingredients might give a spicy sauce some extra feel, particularly in the lips, or nostrils)|Numbing (Sichuan), Sharp (Mustard), Sinus clearing (Raw garlic)|\n|**Burn Location (BL)**|Where you feel it. (Might be personal but, some really make my lips burn but leave my tonge okayish?)|Tip of tongue, throat, lips|\n|**Addictive Quality (AQ)**|Makes you want more despite the burn. (There is an \"Addictive\" quality that some sauces have that even when you can barely tolerate them you want, no you NEED to keep eating it in that moment)|Samyang noodles, spicy chips, some snack \"sauces\"|\n|**Flavor Match (FM)**|How well does heat blend with the taste. (Commonly some fruity sauces can be paired really well with desserts but rarely you will pair a garlic forward sauce with your vanilla ice cream)|Thai chilli (balanced, pair well with almost all), Raw green chilli (harsh, vegetable flavour, better for sour or light savory dishes like fish)|\n\nParticularly I am looking for something to increase the AQ and the SE of my fermented mash. Usually I mix some mango (after ferment does not taste sweet) to provide enough sugar to the bacteria, and lots of garlic for the bulk flavour, Thai chillies as a balanced base with, Bhut Jolokia (Indian ghost pepper) for the smoky flavour and after the mash has fermented for 2 weeks I add some ACV and fresh Thai chillies to up the HL since the ferment tame the product a lot. \n\nThe result is a sauce with: \n\n|HL|BS|BD|SE|MF|BL|AQ|FM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|High|Fast|Medium|Zero|Sharp+Hot|Tongue,+Volatile (careful with your throat or you will cough)|Medium|Great for Sour, and Savory dishes.|\n\nNote: I know I am overthinking it but, I guess the community got what I mean with this post :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1kaj9qr/any_advice_to_achieve_different_effects_in_the/", "created_utc": 1745916643.0, "score": 26, "author": "Wiz718", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1kaj9qr/any_advice_to_achieve_different_effects_in_the/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I don\u2019t have any suggestions but I wanted to virtual fist bump you for inventing and applying qualitative metrics to hot sauce.\n\nYour system reminds me of one of my other highly subjective and nuanced hobbies, fragrance, and the ways people describe each attribute.

I have a new ginger bug that I think may not be very strong yet, because it took a very long time to get any kind of fermentation going (so long, that for two of my sodas I reboiled them, strained them, and added new ginger bug liquid after it had gotten a bit more robust). I now have two bottles of blueberry sage soda that are aggressively carbonated, but are filled with solids that look disconcerting to me. Part of this may have been the method: I worry I didn't strain out enough of the blueberry solids when I made the initial syrup, which also got too jammy, so I dissolved the jelly I made in water before bottling it with the ginger bug--another potential issue?\n\nMy question is the same as most posters: do these look okay? what's the deal with these solids at the top?

Safe, but undesirable flavour-wise. \n\nLike others suggested, there's too much \"headspace\" (too much area at the surface).\n\nNatural ferments (as opposed to adding a dominating culture, such as with yogurt or brewing) need some things to really succeed (in my experience, across a number of natural ferment attempts).\n\n\\- The saying of \"keep everything below the brine\" applies to all ferments. The action is inside the liquid (the natural yeast and lacto cultures) - these anaerobic creatures and do not consume oxygen. Conversely, for reference, acetebact are not, and exposure to air is necessary for the bacteria to turn alcohol into acetic acid (ie, vinegar). \n\n\\- Use a vessel with a small neck that will reduce the exposed surface area of liquid (like a carboy).\n\n\\- There is also the problem of using whole ingredients. Once cultures begin acting, the trapped gasses will float the ingredients to the surface. So, to avoid this, I blitz down all the ingredients, and strain them through a cheesecloth. It avoids a lot of schmoo, and nothing floats to the surface to allow aerobic bacteria, yeast or mould to form.\n\n\\- Agitate the surface every day (at least), to help reduce the chances of undesirable areobic creatures from setting up shop.\n\n\\- And as a quick last point: there's a difference between the kahm yeast that forms at the top, versus the white lactobacteria leftovers you will find in solution, musty-ing the look of the brine, and at the bottom of the ferment, creating a distinct white settled sediment."]}

You absolutely can bottle it right then and there. I think some people put it in jars to ferment for a few days for a couple reasons. One, the bottleneck can cause some headspace issues and lead to your soda bursting out of the bottle when you open it. I just leave a little extra headspace to be sure and I burp twice a day. Two, a jar lets you add in bigger ingredients like chunked fruit for added flavor and to help the fermentation along with the wild yeast on the skin of the fruit. Just make sure you cool whatever your base is to room temp before mixing in your bug and raw fruit.\n\n2. The ginger is mostly for added flavor, but like I mentioned above, adding more fresh ginger will add more wild yeast to help the fermentation along. It\u2019s not necessary though.\n\nIf anyone disagrees or has anything to add please feel free!"]}

Good luck!", ">5%\n\nThere's your problem. You should weight salt at 2.25 % per cabbage weight. The extra salt will slow, or even inhibit microbial activity. You need to get the salt ratio right to get optimal fermentation. At 2.25 % you ferment for around 21 days and will result in good sauerkraut (assuming you did other steps correctly). Higher salt % will slow fermentation down and may take two months. Now, if you accidentally added to much salt you can drain the brine and then replace it with 3% salt solution. That might kick start the fermentation again."]}

I feed it with a tablespoon sugar and ginger each night. \n\nFirst time for me, but maybe there aren't enough sugar in it?", "Couple tips I can provide that most guides don\u2019t tend to explain:\n\n1: use organic ginger if possible, but the most important part of the ginger for a bug is the skin(that is what contains the bulk of the wild yeast). Either dice it(as it looks like you did) or finely grate it, skin and all. A non-organic ginger root can still produce results BUT they do tend to get irradiated as a form to extend their shelf life by killing off any bacteria that aids in breaking down the food(spoiling it faster). There can still be wild yeast present but much; or all; of it could be killed off in that process. \n\n2: Don\u2019t seal the jar. Instead culture it aerobically using something very fine, ideally a coffee filter(cloth is okay too but please no cheesecloth) If you have concerns about fruit flies in your area, I suggest the coffee filter over a mason jar with the ring screwed down over the filter. Doing it anaerobically at this stage will create ethanol(alcohol) in the bug much faster and will carbonate it unnecessarily. Needless to say, it does nothing for your bug or future drinks/brews to seal it. Aerobically you will know it\u2019s working when ginger begins to float and fill with bubbles.\n\n3. It\u2019s important to see some bubbles within the first seven days so you know there is some bacteria in there to work with(ideally in 2-5 days). This often times is a bacterial bloom, so it is normal to see it go dormant a couple days later as they all duke it out. If you don\u2019t see anything in the first seven days, just restart. At that point be patient, you might be in for a wait until one strain of yeast along with some Lactic Acid Bacteria win the race over all the other yeast and bacteria. \n\nYour best tool is patience. It\u2019s not an exact science because everyone deals with different combinations of bacteria in their bugs, so don\u2019t get discouraged if yours isn\u2019t performing as quickly or in the same way. If you see that bacterial bloom in the first week, then at that point patience is your best friend.\n\nAs an example, my most recent one went dormant day 5 and didn\u2019t come back to life until 10 days later and has worked great for a few libations and sodas. I did that one entirely with non-organic ginger and raw cane sugar.\n\nEdit: for reference, raw cane sugar is much less beneficial to a ginger bug than white sugar. Though it may feel counterintuitive when saying this, white sugar is better because of how much it has been processed. Your ginger bug just needs sugar to eat, and that\u2019s all that white sugar has. Raw cane sugar is abundant with impurities and minerals that don\u2019t contribute to the bug at all. That being said, I used raw to prove that any sugar is fine for those wanting to use what they have available at home.", "First thought would be a preservative/antibacterial agent. Is your tap water chlorinated? And did you use organic ginger? Temperature could be a factor but only if it\u2019s particularly cool where you have it, like under 65 F.\n\nOtherwise it could just be a batch that didn\u2019t take off or just has yet to.

My family never made it tho so I have no secret recipe. I've usually bought the zakwas pasteurized or home made from a shop.\n\nBut this Easter I chose to finally make my own zakwas. In looking up recipes and in cookbooks I own, the ratio of flour to water varies WIDELY, to the point I've never seen an identical recipe. Other variations are spices/no spices and stirring/no stirring. \n\nI settled on 1/2 cup flour to 500ml of water, but I've seen recipes that more than double this quantity for the same amount of water, but also half the amount for twice the amount of water. I also settled on no spices or garlic since it's my first zakwas. I'm using a cheesecloth, and keeping it close-ish to the radiator because I tend to keep a cold ish house at this time of the year and I'm cutting it super close.\n\nI haven't been stirring because that appears to be the standard, but I'm on day 3 and I went from no activity to a thick foamy layer this morning so I stirred it back in so it could settle and prevent mold formation. It definitely has a *smell* that's mildly unpleasant but I tasted and it's close to what I expect and obviously it's not done fermenting.\n\nAnyways, just looking for some clarity on why ratios and instructions vary so widely for zakwas. Anyone with some expert knowledge could help me understand whether more water would make it more or less sour, how much of the flour itself people normally find palatable for the soup, etc. I would say I have significantly more flour as is compared to zakwas I've bought, but then again I do get disappointed sometimes when a batch I've bought is not sour enough.\n\nWeso\u0142ych \u015awi\u0105t", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1k2g91z/question_about_zakwas_na_\u017curek/", "created_utc": 1745011955.0, "score": 1, "author": "mencryforme5", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1k2g91z/question_about_zakwas_na_\u017curek/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

{"title": "Beautiful Butterfly Pea Tea Soda", "selftext": "As far as the fizz goes these drinks have more hit to the throat than store brands. And it is all without chemicals, artificial ingredients/sweeteners and colors. Three ingredients for the base that makes the fizz: organic unpeeled ginger, bottled spring water and organic sugar. The tea or liquid you choose for flavor is endless. Above, that is Butterfly Pea tea, an organic tea that is naturally blue and used for coloring other foods.\n\nAdding lemon will turn the tea purple.\n\n\nThe nutritive properties of the tea are:\n(http://rawandlovely.blogspot.com/2014/02/health-benefits-of-butterfly-pea-tea.html)\n*  Strengthens the hair for healthy hair growth\n*  Prevents skin bruising\n*  Keeps skin glowing & healthy\n*  Treats urinary problems\n*  Improves eyesight & night vision\n*  Treats eye infections\n*  Stimulates blood circulation\n*  Detoxifies the whole body\n*  Provides antioxidants\n*  Slows aging process\n*  Enhances immune system \n\nAnd:\n(http://www.wildturmeric.net/2015/12/blue-butterfly-pea-tea-recipe-health-benefits-medicinal-uses.html)\n1. Butterfly pea tea is full of antioxidants and has been proven through clinical research. You can find the link to the study.\n2. Butterfly pea tea has been proven to have anti glycation properties. Glycation is damage caused to protein because of sugar molecules and it is one of the main causes of skin aging. Butterfly pea tea prevents this damage and helps prevent premature aging of our skin. You can find the link to the study.\n3. Butterfly pea tea has been shown to have anti inflammatory properties. \n4. Butterfly pea tea is very good for people suffering from chronic fatigue as it improves vitality. \n5. The tea has been proven to have analgesic properties (pain relieving properties). You can find the link to the study proving it's analgesic and anti inflammatory properties. \n\nAnd the taste is smooth and subtle... until you make it into a ginger ale. Then the fizz will refresh you and take you back for more. \n\nYou should know this drink is probiotic. That's a great thing.\n\n\nThe recipe for the ginger bug. You have to have this in order to turn the tea into soda...\n1 hand of fresh organic ginger (just get a piece the size of your hand and you will have enough)\n6 tablespoons Organic sugar\n1 cup bottled spring water (if your city uses chloramine in its water then bottled water is essential. You cannot boil the chemical out and need to purchase a special filter to get rid of it. It is not the same chemical as chlorine.)\n1 tablespoon organic white or apple cider vinegar\nSpring water for rinsing\n\nUsing a jar with screw on lid, add the vinegar and some bottled water. About 1/4 cup total. Put lid on jar and swirl liquid around to coat the entire inside. Pour out solution then rinse with some more water. The reason for this is to remove any residue that may inhibit growth of the yeast needed to produce your carbonation (fizz). The yeast grows from the unpeeled ginger and the sugar. The vinegar promotes the process. It is important to use organic unpeeled ginger. Regular ginger has been irradiated and that will prevent the yeast from forming and you are trying to not use chemical or processed ingredients in this healthy drink.\n\nGrate ginger to get 3 tablespoons. Add to the clean jar.\nAdd the 3 tablespoons of sugar.\nAdd the 1 cup of water.\nEither stir or shake to mix.\nSet bug aside for 24 hours.\nOn the second day, add another tablespoon of ginger and another tablespoon of sugar.\nRepeat for two more days.\nOn the third day your bug is ready to use.\n\nWhile your bug is fermenting decide which flavor you want. You can just use lemon, more spring water and more sugar if you just want plain. But this post is about the Butterfly Pea tea...\n\n\nApproximately 56 ounces spring bottled water\n1/2 cup dried Butterfly Pea tea flowers\nat least 1/2 cup organic cane sugar\nYou can either add or not add the juice and rind of a whole fresh lemon. The lemon will turn the tea a yummy looking purple. (see photos).\n1/2 gallon (64 0z) canning jar with screw on lid or regular ring/lid combo.\n\n\nIn a stainless steel pot, add 2 cups of spring water. Bring to a boil. Add the tea flowers. Let steep until mixture is cool.\n\nRinse jar with the vinegar/water solution as you did with the bug. Be sure to do a second rinse with plain bottled water.\nAdd 1 cup of ginger bug\nAdd the cooled Butterfly Pea tea\nIf you are using the lemon add it now...\nAdd the 1/2 cup sugar. (at this point you may want to add up to another 1/2 of cup because the yeast will eat most of the sugar and the drink will be very tart)\nAdd enough water to fill the jar to within 1 inch. \nMix well until sugar has dissolved.\nScrew on lid.\nPlace jar out of direct sunlight but not in the refrigerator. The location should be warm at least 70 degrees.\nAllow to ferment for three days.\nStir or shake drink to mix up the yeast that has settled to the bottom and then strain mixture into a container like a large mixing cup.\nPour into individual swing top bottles like the one pictured below or acquire Groslch beer bottles. Both are made to withstand the pressure of carbonated drinks.\nAfter bottling chill in refrigerator and leave there until ready to drink.\n\nAt this point you should know that this process creates a lot of carbonation. When you open a bottle it may blow the bale either back or off the bottle. To keep from losing your drink place the bottle in a bowl before opening. In that way you will catch what shoots out.

The finished moto looks like a cream-soup.\n\nInstruction: Sake (14-32 days process)\n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 1\n\n1. Cook rice for 1 cup (380 g. steamed rice = 1 cup 200 g. uncooked sushi rice), cool it to room temperature.  Then put in a big glass container. This way you\u2019ll be able to oversee the whole process. Coat inside with cooking wine before use. \n\n2. Add 500 ml of water\n\n3. Add the moto yeast starter \n\n4. Add a cup of Koji rice (160 g)\n\n5. Mix well, leave at the cold place, stir the mixture every 10-12 hours \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 3\n\n1.

The pellicle in vinegar is made from the same or similar bacteria as you have in vinegar. Acetic acid bacteria are Omni present so it\u2019s likely that if someone has been making kombucha with the same starter over and over again that its probably no longer the original bacteria creating the vinegar but whatever bacteria is in their environment as it\u2019s an open fermentation. Cheese cloth isn\u2019t stopping other bacteria from getting into the mixture just stops bugs and not even all of them.\n\nMain difference is the amount of sugar used. Apples/ apple juice are going to make 5-6% alcohol which will eventually end up as vinegar. Alcohol in kombucha will turn 100% to vinegar if given enough time out in the open which is why it\u2019s bottled after anywhere from 1-4 weeks which is before all ethanol is vinegar. Bottling it traps CO2 in the solution so the acetic acid bacteria can no longer produce more vinegar.\n\nYes they are going to have slightly different organisms but quite frankly it\u2019s not the difference people would lead you to believe. Kombucha probably has more lactic acid bacteria than your vinegar apples but the yeasts could very well be similar. Kombucha was originally a spontaneous wild ferment after all and the original probably had yeasts from citrus peels, ginger and honey as well as whatever LAB and acer bacteria were in the air at the time. \n\nIt\u2019s so expensive to test no one really knows and there is a lot overlap in geneome as well between all of these organisms.\n\nStore bought kombucha is probably entirely different from real kombucha for most brands.

I have never had any issues with home fermented foods either, but its been a year or 2 since I have had it.\n\nI do have anxiety, but I have never hand anything like this before. But I don't think its impossible.\n\nAs for something else? Im not allergic to anything I know of, didn't eat anything else today, and only have had a mild cold for a bit.\n\nMy next course of action is to monitor. The pain and overall \"odd\" feeling has lessened, but is still a little present, i would say it went from a 3 to a 1. From there, I will see if this is a pattern, and talk to my doctor.\n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\nUPDATE: After thinking about it for a few mins, I have came to the conclusion that its a little of all these things kinda.\n\n1. That numb feeling seems to be common on eating ferments\n\n2. Anxiety making my feeling worse\n\n3. I did some lifting today and my neck is a little sore, the pain is more like if i irked it than consistant, and my cold is making my lymph nodes painful, but the numbness made me for the first time try and touch them and feel the pain. \n\nI'm sure im fine.

A few words of caution - please go really slow. Re-introduce one thing at a time to your diet. Don't get scared of dyscomfort, unfortunately it goes with the territory. It is not a sign that things are getting worse, it's normal. New foods and new gut flora will quite likely cause symptoms that you have had before (just as you experienced after the keto-phase; almost all restrictive diets give short time relief, but getting back to varied diet is difficult), you just have to ride them out, and it can take time. Also, you should start with ridiculously small amounts and slowly increase them, even though the dyscomfort hasn't completely subsided.\n\nIn terms of what to eat, sourdough bread is probably the safest to start with, but quite difficult to make from beginning to consumable product.   \nMy second suggestion would be cheese, again, difficult to make.  \nThen I would introduce kefir, this can be made by yourself. Also yogurt could be an option.  \nNext sauerkraut (here I can offer a recipe: thinly slice a cabbage, weigh it, calculate about 2,5 % of the total weight for salt, mix them with your hands in a wide bowl, squeezing the cabbage as you go. If you can find caraway seeds, add some (this helps digestability). Squeeze tightly into a jar, add all the juice from the bowl, if needed, add a bit of lukewarm water until almost covered.

{"title": "Milloa: The Fizzy Traditional Indian Probiotic Drink Made with Millets", "selftext": "# Milloa: The Fizzy Traditional Indian Probiotic Drink Made with Millets\n\nDiscover the magic of Milloa - Fermented Millets Fizzy Drink GUT, a delicious probiotic beverage that not only quenches your thirst but also supports your gut health. In this blog, we'll explore the journey of creating this unique drink, its health benefits, and why it's a must-try for everyone this summer.\n\n# Introduction to Milloa\n\nMilloa is not just a drink; it\u2019s a revolution in gut health. This fermented millets fizzy drink combines traditional wisdom with modern nutrition. By utilizing the power of millets, Milloa provides a refreshing option that caters to your taste buds while also supporting your digestive system.\n\n# Why Choose Milloa?\n\n* **Probiotic Power:**\u00a0Milloa is rich in probiotics, promoting a healthy gut microbiome.\n* **Low Sugar Content:**\u00a0With significantly less sugar than traditional fizzy drinks, it\u2019s a guilt-free refreshment.\n* **Gluten-Free:**\u00a0Perfect for those with gluten sensitivities, Milloa offers a safe alternative.\n* **Accessible Ingredients:**\u00a0Made from widely available millets, anyone can recreate this health elixir.\n\n# The Importance of Probiotics\n\nProbiotics are essential for maintaining gut health. They are live microorganisms that provide numerous health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. In today\u2019s fast-paced world, where stress and poor dietary choices are common, probiotics play a crucial role in preventing various ailments.\n\n# Health Benefits of Probiotics\n\n* **Improved Digestion:**\u00a0Probiotics assist in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients effectively.\n* **Enhanced Immunity:**\u00a0A healthy gut flora strengthens the immune system, helping to ward off infections.\n* **Reduction of Inflammation:**\u00a0Probiotics can help reduce inflammation in the gut, alleviating symptoms of conditions like IBS.\n\n# Understanding Gut Health\n\nGut health encompasses the balance of microorganisms living in the digestive tract. A well-functioning gut contributes to overall health, affecting everything from digestion to mental well-being. The gut-brain connection highlights how gut health can influence mood and cognitive function.\n\n# Signs of a Healthy Gut\n\n* **Regular Bowel Movements:**\u00a0Consistency is key; ideally, one should have daily bowel movements.\n* **Minimal Digestive Discomfort:**\u00a0Occasional bloating or gas is normal, but persistent discomfort is a sign of imbalance.\n* **Good Energy Levels:**\u00a0A healthy gut contributes to better nutrient absorption, leading to higher energy levels.\n\n# Common Gut-Related Issues\n\nMany people experience gut-related issues without realizing the root cause. Conditions such as constipation, diarrhea, and bloating are prevalent, but they can often be managed through dietary changes and the inclusion of probiotic-rich foods like Milloa.\n\n# Common Issues and Their Impact\n\n* **Constipation:**\u00a0Often caused by a lack of fiber and hydration, leading to discomfort.\n* **Diarrhea:**\u00a0Can result from infections or food intolerances, disrupting everyday life.\n* **IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome):**\u00a0A chronic condition that affects gut motility, causing various symptoms.\n\n# The Role of Modern Diet and Lifestyle\n\nModern diets often lack the nutrients necessary for a healthy gut. Processed foods, high in sugar and low in fiber, contribute to gut dysbiosis. Additionally, stress and sedentary lifestyles further exacerbate these issues, creating a cycle that can be difficult to break.\n\n# Strategies for a Healthier Gut\n\n* **Incorporate Whole Foods:**\u00a0Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes to provide essential nutrients.\n* **Stay Hydrated:**\u00a0Adequate water intake is crucial for digestion and nutrient absorption.\n* **Regular Physical Activity:**\u00a0Exercise promotes healthy digestion and reduces stress levels.\n\n# Exploring Probiotic Foods\n\nProbiotic foods are diverse and can easily be incorporated into daily meals. From yogurt to fermented vegetables, these foods are delicious and beneficial. Milloa stands out as a unique option that combines the goodness of millets with the effervescence of a fizzy drink.\n\n# The Concept of Non-Dairy Fermented Drinks\n\nAs more people become lactose intolerant or choose non-dairy lifestyles, the demand for non-dairy fermented drinks has surged. These beverages, like Milloa, offer a probiotic boost without the downsides of dairy.\n\nNon-dairy options include coconut yogurt and nut-based kefirs. They provide similar probiotic benefits without lactose, making them accessible to a wider audience. Milloa stands out by utilizing millets, making it both unique and nutritious.\n\n# The Need for a Fizzy Probiotic Drink\n\nIn today\u2019s world, the allure of fizzy drinks is undeniable. With millions consumed daily, the need for a healthier alternative is pressing. Milloa fills this gap with a fizzy probiotic drink that not only quenches thirst but also promotes gut health.\n\nFizzy beverages often contain high sugar levels, leading to health issues. Milloa offers a refreshing solution with 70% less sugar than traditional fizzy drinks. This makes it an ideal choice for those seeking a guilt-free refreshment.\n\n# Ingredients of Milloa\n\nCreating Milloa involves a simple yet powerful combination of ingredients. The primary components are millets and sugar, which together create a base for fermentation.\n\n* **Millets:**\u00a0Rich in fiber and nutrients, millets serve as the backbone of Milloa.\n* **Sugar:**\u00a0Essential for the fermentation process, it provides food for the beneficial bacteria.\n* **Water:**\u00a0Purified water is crucial for maintaining the quality of the drink.\n* **Optional Fruits:**\u00a0Ingredients like cherries or pineapples can be added for flavor and additional probiotics.\n\n# Understanding Sugar in Fermentation\n\nSugar plays a pivotal role in fermentation. It acts as food for the bacteria and yeast, fueling the fermentation process. In Milloa, the sugar content is carefully balanced, ensuring a flavorful drink without excessive sweetness.\n\nDuring fermentation, bacteria consume a significant portion of the sugar, reducing the final sugar content. This results in a drink that\u2019s not only low in sugar but also rich in probiotics. Understanding this process helps clarify why Milloa is a healthier alternative.\n\n# Why Choose Millets?\n\nMillets are a powerhouse of nutrition. They are gluten-free, high in fiber, and packed with essential vitamins and minerals. Choosing millets for Milloa ensures that the drink is not only tasty but also beneficial for your health.\n\nFurthermore, millets have a low glycemic index, making them suitable for those managing blood sugar levels. Their rich prebiotic fiber content supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, enhancing the overall health benefits of Milloa.\n\n# The Science Behind Milloa\n\nThe fermentation process of Milloa involves various microorganisms, including Saccharomyces yeast and Lactobacillus bacteria. These organisms work together to convert sugars into probiotics, creating a fizzy, health-boosting drink.\n\nAs the fermentation progresses, the drink develops its unique flavor profile and carbonation. This scientific approach not only improves taste but also maximizes the health benefits, making Milloa a delightful addition to your diet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4scwm5xb4ue1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb17ba395c8a2b2d052e14cdbdcfe02a4158148\n\n# The Process of Making Milloa\n\nCreating Milloa is a delightful journey that starts with selecting the right ingredients. The process begins by soaking millets, which helps reduce anti-nutrients and enhances bioavailability. Soak the millets for 24 hours to prepare them for fermentation.\n\nAfter soaking, drain the water and place the millets in a sprouting box. This step is crucial as it allows the millets to germinate slightly, which boosts their nutrient profile. Once sprouted, blend the millets into a smooth paste.\n\nNext, mix the millet paste with sugar and purified water in a clean jar. The typical ratio is about 1/3 cup of millets to 4 tablespoons of sugar and 750 ml of water. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.\n\nCover the jar with a cloth and let it ferment for 3 to 4 days. Daily stirring is essential to prevent any unwanted mold and to ensure even fermentation.\n\n# Fermentation: The Key to Probiotics\n\nFermentation is where the magic happens. During this process, beneficial bacteria and yeasts, such as Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus, consume the sugars, producing probiotics and carbonation. This natural fermentation transforms the millets into a fizzy, gut-friendly drink.\n\nAs fermentation progresses, the sugar content decreases significantly, typically by 50-70%. This not only results in lower sugar levels but also enhances the drink's health benefits, making Milloa a refreshing alternative to sugary beverages.\n\nIt's fascinating to note that the probiotics produced during fermentation can support digestion and boost immunity, making Milloa a powerhouse of health benefits.\n\n# Final Touches and Serving Suggestions\n\nAfter the fermentation period, it's time to add the final touches. For added flavor, consider mixing in fruits like cherries or pineapples, which not only enhance taste but also contribute additional probiotics.\n\nOnce mixed, give the drink a good shake to ensure everything is well combined. Serve Milloa chilled for a refreshing experience. You can also garnish it with mint leaves or a slice of lemon for an extra zing.\n\nThis versatile drink can be enjoyed on its own or paired with meals. It makes an excellent accompaniment to spicy dishes, balancing flavors while benefiting your gut health.\n\n# Tasting Milloa\n\nWhen you take your first sip of Milloa, you\u2019ll notice its unique flavor profile. The balance of sweetness and slight tang from the fermentation is refreshing. The fizzy texture adds to the overall experience, making it a delightful drink for any occasion.\n\nAs you taste, pay attention to the subtle notes of the millets and the added fruits. Each batch may vary slightly, offering a new experience with every preparation. This unpredictability is part of the charm of homemade fermented drinks.\n\nInvite friends or family to taste Milloa and watch their surprise upon learning it\u2019s made from millets.

But if you're wondering how much sugar is actually left after fermentation, here's the complete breakdown!\n\n# Ingredients Used\n\nFor\u00a0**750 ml**\u00a0of homemade Milloa:\n\n* **45g sugar**\u00a0(for primary fermentation)\n* **20g foxtail millet**\u00a0(adds minimal natural carbs/sugar)\n* **100g fresh cherries**\u00a0(added during second fermentation \u2014 contains approx.\u00a0**18g sugar**)\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f\u00a0**Total sugar added: \\~65g**\n\n# Understanding Fermentation\n\nFermentation is a natural process where\u00a0**microorganisms like yeasts and lactic acid bacteria**\u00a0(LAB) consume sugar and convert it into:\n\n* **Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082)**\u00a0\u2192 makes it fizzy\n* **Organic acids**\u00a0\u2192 like lactic acid (gut-friendly)\n* **Tiny amounts of alcohol**\u00a0(usually < 0.5%)\n\n# What Happens to the Sugar?\n\n# Primary Fermentation (3\u20134 Days)\n\n* Microbes consume\u00a0**\\~60\u201370%**\u00a0of the initial sugar.\n* From the\u00a0**45g added**, around\u00a0**30g is fermented**, leaving about\u00a0**15g residual sugar**.\n\n# Second Fermentation (1\u20132 Days)\n\n* Cherries add\u00a0**18g sugar**.\n* Again, microbes consume\u00a0**\\~50\u201370%**, meaning\u00a0**9\u201312g**\u00a0gets fermented.\n* This leaves\u00a0**6\u20139g**\u00a0of sugar from cherries.\n\n**Residual Sugar: \\~21\u201324g per 750ml bottle**\n\n# How Sweet Is That?\n\nThat means\u00a0**Milloa contains just about 7\u20138g of sugar per 250ml**\u00a0\u2014\u00a0**way less than commercial soft drinks**\u00a0(which have 24\u201326g/250ml). Yet it still tastes mildly sweet and delightfully fizzy\u2014thanks to nature\u2019s fermentation magic!\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What ingredients are needed to make Milloa?\n\nThe primary ingredients for Milloa are millets, sugar, and purified water. Optional fruits can be added for flavor.\n\n# How long does the fermentation process take?\n\nThe fermentation process typically takes 3 to 4 days, depending on the ambient temperature and desired taste.\n\n# Can I use different fruits for flavoring?\n\nYes, you can experiment with various fruits like cherries, pineapples, or pomegranates to create different flavor profiles.\n\n# Is Milloa suitable for people with gluten intolerance?\n\nAbsolutely! Milloa is made from millets, which are gluten-free, making it a safe choice for those with gluten sensitivities.\n\n# How should Milloa be stored?\n\nAfter fermentation, store Milloa in an airtight jar in the refrigerator to maintain its freshness and carbonation\n\nInvented by TeluguSuperMoms Youtube Channel #TeluguSuperMoms #Milloa", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1jwflcy/milloa_the_fizzy_traditional_indian_probiotic/", "created_utc": 1744339084.0, "score": 0, "author": "POCOINVEST", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jwflcy/milloa_the_fizzy_traditional_indian_probiotic/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["AI on the fermentation subreddit?"]}

{"title": "Where Am I Going Wrong?", "selftext": "I\u2019m trying to start a ginger bug. The guide I\u2019m following is simple: 2 c filtered water, 1 T brown sugar, 1 T skin on ginger cut 1/8 inch, mix until sugar is dissolved. Every 24 hours, feed 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp ginger. \n\n1st attempt: went very well at first. I actually totally misread the recipe and 1. peeled my ginger and 2. realized the entire time that the recipe called for 2 tsp of ginger and 2 tsp of sugar, not one tsp of each. Either way, it was a very happy ginger bug. I made it to day 5 with bubbles galore. Kept it on the counter top in a corner of my kitchen. It was about 95 degrees outside, and it\u2019s consistently 75-78 degrees inside and very dry, as I live in the desert. \n\nHere comes day 6. It starts smelling\u2026 strong. Not bad, but a little\u2026 cheesy? I call this yeasty in my head and move on. I decided to (stupidly) follow the recipe and start feeding it the 2 tsp of each. Then day 7\u2026 I wake up, excited to make my ginger beer\u2026 no bubbles. At all. I read everything on here to troubleshoot. I took out a 1/4 cup, replaced with a 1/4 cup of filtered water, let it rest a day, nothing. So I pitched it. Started new.\n\nAttempt #2:\n\nI re sanitize EVERYTHING. Jar, lid, measuring spoon, hands, KNIFE, CUTTING BOARD, COUNTERTOP. After aggressively sanitizing everything in sight, let\u2019s get down to business. This time I chop my very clean, very fresh ginger SKIN ON this time. Into my jar goes 2 cups of filtered water, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp of 1/8in cubes of ginger. Next day, bubbles already! I feed it 2 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp ginger, give the outside of the jar a (sanitized) kiss and put it to sleep for the night. Day 2, even more bubbles! I feed again, same thing, only this time, I notice before I go to bed\u2026 there\u2019s no bubbles? Maybe I just need to wait until the morning. Next morning\u2026 nothing. I waited all day at work just thinking about my bug and the delicious ginger beer I\u2019ll have if I do it correctly. All the friends I\u2019ll make when I tell everyone that I ferment my own sodas. I get home and there\u2019s 2 LITTLE TINY F***ING FLOATING FUZZY WHITE BITS OF MOLD?! Why?! Okay. Discard. Try again.\n\nAttempt #3:\n\nToday we are on day #4. I sanitized EVERYTHING AGAIN. TWICE. Followed the same steps, but I\u2019m back to peeling my ginger and only feeding 1 tsp ginger/sugar a day because I had success with my first batch doing that and I feel like feeding 2 tsp is what offed my first batch. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just going with my gut. I\u2019m seeing absolutely no bubbles and it\u2019s day 4, but I don\u2019t want to give up. She smells good, she looks good. And it sounds stupid, but I see some bubbles when I shake it. Maybe that\u2019s just from shaking it. lol I read on this thread to give it a sugar break for a few days, so today is day one of a sugar break. The first 2 days I believe I\u2019ve been feeding it ginger that wasn\u2019t minced enough, so I chopped it up smaller yesterday and started feeding her smaller bits of ginger. \n\nI\u2019ve fermented so many things, but am having such a hard time getting a ginger bug going.

{"title": "Turned sour \ud83d\ude1e", "selftext": "This is my first ever try at making \"Sato\", the Thai variety of a Doburoku-ish drink. Unfortunately this experiment looks bust and I'm learning from the experience. I'd like to run a few aspects of this failure by this community and see what's there to learn and improve, avoid and retry.\n\nFirst off, the end result; this batch turned sour.. and there was no real way of keeping an eye on taste development.. Sato is brewed by adding a \"Sato ball\" (a fungus/yeast combo)  to a portion of steamed rice. Unlike Doburoku the first stage of about a week is a dry is stage. No water added except that which is contained in the steamed rice. The fungus starts to turn the starches into sugars, and sort of simultaneously the yeast start to kick in. At about a week into the process 1L of water is added to 1Kg of rice. Then supposedly a last fermenting phase takes place lasting about three days. The brew should be separated from the solids and kept in fridge. Longer fermenting supposedly has the brew turn sour.\nAfter 3 days the result should be a cloudy, sweet raw rice wine. Similar to Doburoku.\n\nSo, today was adding the water day.. I did. The dry stuff in the jar smelled like a rice wine, kind of sweet-ish with a distinct alcoholic vapor. Actually quite an attractive bouquet. After adding the water the brew started bubbling quite a bit, so all seemed in order.  A few hours later I could finally have a little taste of the brew as there were enough liquids to actually do so..  okay.. the stuff tasted sour.. not really like a vinegar, more acidic-ish.. (I lack proper expertise to characterise the taste better)\n\nSome details of my process that may have caused the sourness: (?) \n\n1. I used more Sato powder (fungus*yeast) than stated in the recipe. I crushed one ball to powder but ended up using about 30/40% more as I felt the amount I should add looked ludicrously minimal compared to the amount of sweet rice.\n\n2. I do not own a rice steamer and cooked my rice. It may have been a tad over cooked.. not mushy tho!\n\n3. I did, as per the traditional recipe, wash the steamed rice to loosen the grains. Again here, I did not completely let the grains dry. Strained them and added to the jar. Rice was far from dripping wet, but certainly also not dry. \n\n4. During the dry stage (first 6-7 days) I cracked the lid a few times to smell the brew. (Check for foul smell) I did notice a slight turn to a yellowish color of the rice in the jar that had me worried. The smell was fantastic so, worries gone.. but did I introduce acetic bacteria? The stuff that has wines spoil to vinegar??\n\n5. At the start I did however thoroughly clean containers l, even with rubbing alcohol to decontaminate as much as possible. (Which seemed as waaa\u00e1y over doing it as a friend of mine in Thailand is doing the same recipy in the middle of the jungle with quite poor sanitation.. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f???\n\n6. Temperature?? In Thailand the brew is done around 30-40 celcius during day time.. so the fungus/yeast combo operates at quite high temps i guess.. much higher as the 20 celcius ish where Doburoku is preferably is brewed at.. here in Portugal in my place its been early spring and quite cold. I kept my room to about 22ish with a heater. The jars were in front of the window, so may have been a bit colder even. At coldest times I moved the jars a bit closer to the heater as I feared a stalled process (remember ambient temps in Thailand are waaa\u00e1y higher during the brew process)..\n\nSo, all in all, theres been quite some guesswork and loosy loosy approach.. I admit. But it seemed a recipy that allowed for much looseness?? I'm about to just give it another go.. got more Sato balls and lots of time on my hands. Just wondering what I should take from this try and learn, improve and or avoid.\n\nAny souls out there willing to chime in?

You can clean the airlock and replace it once things have slowed down, but if there's CO2 bubbling through the airlock, any brine in there is protected. \n\nAnd lastly, I'm not doubting you, but make sure what you're seeing is actually mold.

{"title": "Basic question about salt", "selftext": "It's clear that salt is the bread and butter of fermentation. \n\nWhat I can't wrap my head around is why we salt cabbage to then rinse it all off when making kimchi, and don't rinse off other ferments like sauerkraut. \n\nIsn't  the whole point of saying a 3% that the 3% stays in the ferment and not washed completely off through repeated rinsing? ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1jr9hm8/basic_question_about_salt/", "created_utc": 1743765770.0, "score": 3, "author": "Styropian", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jr9hm8/basic_question_about_salt/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["one of kimchi's ingredients is fish sauce or similar, which contains a lot of salt; not to mention when you rinse the veg, the penetrated salt won't be washed away. with e.g. kraut, you start with the desired amount of salt and don't add any other salty ingredients", "Kimchi is deliberately oversalted, and then fish sauce and saeujeot are later added to further salinate it but also add flavor. To make it tolerable, you need to wash off excess salt and drain the water it pulls out of the cabbage.", "So it's important to understand reasoning behind using salt. It's not just for flavor. The gold standard is utilizing 3% weight in salt. That's a concentration of salt that inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and encourages the lactic bacteria that cause fermentation. As long as your mixture has 3% salt at the time of fermentation, it's considered salty enough.\n\nWith kimchi, salt also works as an osmotic agent to pull liquid out of the cabbage and encourage a textural change. The amount of salt used in that step is much higher than the 3% needed for safe fermentation. It's too salty in fact for a tasty product. So with kimchi you salt it to draw out moisture and then wash it off (but not everything) to get back to close to 3%. Additionally, the paste often used in kimchi can include things like salted shrimp, fish sauce, and other salty ingredients, so you're adding salt back in to the equation. \n\nThere are recipes out there that don't use the salt and washing method and ferment the cabbage just like sauerkraut but with chilli flakes and fish sauce in the mix to get the stereotypical kimchi flavor. \n\nEnd of the day, salt plays multiple roles and in kimchi we are balancing those roles against each other to get a delicious product", "For kimchi, the salting at the outset is to draw out moisture. Otherwise kimchi would form a watery brine like sauerkraut. When you rinse it off, you aren\u2019t removing all the salt that has gotten into the cabbage. So it\u2019s important to taste to make sure you rinsed off enough salt but not too much that it loses the flavor.  So the salt is still present.", "For kimchi, the salt in the beginning is really more to draw water out of the cabbage. I think of 2 reasons for this: one, for texture; two, to limit amount of liquid in the brine. As for the rinse, it is to limit the salt since other forms of salt will be added.", "Omg i love this question. Also there are lots of perfect answers to your question below but I sort of wanted to add my perspective which in some ways will just summarize or restate things already said.\n\nI feel like the reason this was confusing is because salt actually serves a few different purposes in fermentation, though it often does many/all if these things simultaneously. This may not be a perfect summary of them all but some of the uses I can think of are:\n\n1 - to pull natural liquid/nutrients out of a matrix of fiber or protein\n\n2 - to select for particular kinds of microbes/discourage the growth of microbes that may cause harm\n\n3 - to control the rate at which those microbes grow and break down the fermentation substrate\n\n4 - to be oh so yummy and provide an essential nutrient in the final product\n\nIn sauerkraut it kind of does all these things at once. Pulls out the cabbage juice leaving a brine with a percentage of salt that selects the right organisms as controls their growth while remaining at a palatable level for human consumption. Kim chi is a very sophisticated ferment that uses salt and other salty ferments (compound fermentation you might say) to perform different functions at different stages. You can thank millennia of Korean ingenuity for the mad scientist energy behind this process. Some ferments like fish sauce or soy sauce require relatively unpalatable salt levels to adequately control fermentation for food safety and slow the process for long aging times that develop complex flavors and break down unpleasant ones, which is why they end up used as a condiment or ingredient rather than as a food per se."]}

Don't consider me an expert, though.\n\nAs with freezing anything, your enemy is water crystals. When water freezes, it expands. The extra space, combined with the inflexibility, causes water crystals to rip cells apart. It's why freezing tends to kill some of the bacteria, and it's why your formerly frozen fruits and vegetables have a different texture. \n\nMy yeast freezing process involves a glycerin solution to help guard against ice crystals. A little.\n\nHere's the thing with yeast. It's really *really* small. Subsequently, there's A LOT of them. We're talking populations measured in millions and/or billions.\n\nThe odds of freezing killing every single one are infinitesimally small. And the survivors will reproduce given the correct conditions. So theoretically, the yeast will almost certainly recover.\n\nBUT... The lower quantities of live yeast at the start can be a problem.\n\nAll fermentation is a race. Our team is the good bacteria. We're cheering for them to outcompete the bad bacteria enough that the pH is lowered, and the bad bacteria are severely inhibited. If that happens fast enough, the population of the bad bacteria is kept low. Very low. And the food remains safe.\n\nA lower starting population of the bacteria we want can slow that process down. Its population has to build further before it reaches 'critical mass.' Which can give other bacteria a chance to get established and compete with it.\n\nThis isn't the definitive answer you're looking for. It may be fine. But the odds of it not being fine are a little higher. That's not a reason to not try, just pay attention. But then, you should always be paying attention to your ferments."]}

{"title": "Simple L. reuteri \"Oats Based Protective Matrix\" Protocol for Better Stomach Acid Survival", "selftext": "  \nThis post was removed on\u00a0[r/Microbiome](https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/)\u00a0so to keep it alive, I am crossposting here as it may benefit others.  \n  \nHi everyone, I wanted to share a simple protocol I just started based on research around improving L. reuteri survival through the stomach, and I would love to get thoughts from others who are experimenting with this strain.\n\nI\u2019m aware of the popular L. reuteri yogurt method, but I have a hunch this might be just as effective at delivering the bacteria to the small intestine \u2014 and much easier. That said, I'm open to feedback, as I could be overlooking something that makes this less effective.\n\n# The Idea:\n\nThe goal is to give Oats Based Protective Matrix(via Biogaia Baby drops) a better chance to survive gastric acid and reach the small intestine in higher numbers, where it seems to work its magic.\n\n# My Protocol:\n\n* Step 1: Eat a small to normal meal first This helps naturally buffer stomach acid (raises pH temporarily). I include gut-friendly foods like oats, chia seeds, bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin seeds for fiber and prebiotic effects.\n* Step 2: Mid-meal (or about 2/3 of the way through), I take:\n   * 1 tablespoon of raw rolled oats (dry) with 10 drops of L. reuteri drops dripped directly onto the oats.\n   * Let it sit for 5\u201310 minutes to soak in (which it does very effectively).\n   * Drizzle 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) over the oats.\n   * \u26a0\ufe0f Be mindful that many EVOO brands are not truly pure EVOO. I recommend finding one that has been lab tested \u2014 there are plenty of websites and YouTube videos helping identify authentic EVOO depending on where you live.\n* Optional: Add a pinch of inulin powder or other resistant starch like green bananas for extra prebiotics.\n* Step 3: Swallow the soaked oats without too much chewing. The goal is to let the oats and EVOO act as a \"natural capsule\" to help L. reuteri pass through the stomach more intact.\n\n# Why I\u2019m Trying This:\n\n* EVOO slows gastric emptying and may protect the bacteria.\n* Oats and fiber could act as both a vehicle and a prebiotic which in the 37 degree Celsius of the small intestine is a great place to ferment day after day.\n* Mid-meal timing takes advantage of naturally buffered stomach conditions.\n\n# Plan:\n\nI\u2019ll be sticking to this daily (or twice daily) and plan to report back over the next few weeks to share:\n\n* Any noticeable effects (gut health, mood, sleep, etc.)\n* Any tweaks I make along the way\n\n# Questions:\n\n* Has anyone else tried something similar?\n* Any suggestions to refine this further?\n* Would love to hear from anyone who\u2019s done other \u201cDIY\u201d delivery methods for L. reuteri\n* Am I going against the already proven Yogurt method with my method already proven ineffective?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts, and I hope to create a bit of a log here as I go!\n\nThis is what my \"Oats Based Protective Matrix\" looked like when ready to be eaten.  Was an easy one bite swallow.  I hope the majority of the L. reuteri makes it way through my stomach acid. We will see.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cr4h6pgtvxre1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7909f9ae02ce61466340df894a19a938f7feb0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1jpfdqk/simple_l_reuteri_oats_based_protective_matrix/", "created_utc": 1743564898.0, "score": 0, "author": "immersive-matthew", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jpfdqk/simple_l_reuteri_oats_based_protective_matrix/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Interesting idea, though you can't possibly know if L. reuteri penetrates the oats. you could also try soaking in physillum husk or chia seeds which produce a slime maybe that's kind of protective for the l. reuteri.   \n  \nIn the end if you want safe passage to the small intestine you'll need enteric coated capsules.   \n  \nThe yogurt method is not so much about delivering l. reuteri to the small intestine imo but more of growing the bacterial culture in it and thus ingesting more of it when eating the yogurt.", "Update 1:\n\nIt has been a little over a week of daily l. reuteri via the oats method and I wanted to share my experience so far.\u00a0 Since I began I have consumed 8ml of the BioGaia drops, all of which was added to the dry oats as described.\u00a0 This is about 3.2 billion CFUs\\*\\*.\\*\\* I also ate many natural foods known to be fermented by reuteri like raw bananas, sweet potatoes and of course the oats. \u00a0 I definitely had gas as a result which I took as a good sign, albeit a tad uncomfortable a couple of times but nothing that impacted my day and not smelly (wife might disagree).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn terms of health observations.\u00a0 Definitely feeling different.\u00a0 I stopped taking my daily water kefir at the same time, the benefits of which typically fade after 5-7 days and yet, I am still sleeping like a baby.\u00a0 Very sound sleep which is why I was drinking daily kefir prior and stopped to eliminate this variable. Further, I am noticing that high glutamate foods that often make me very hyper hours after ingestion seem to be reduced fairly substantially. Finally, and I am not sure this is related, but I tend to suffer from an itchy face that I discovered years ago was fungal based.\u00a0 I apply a cream to my face every 2-4 days when I start to notice the itch again. Today I just realized that I have not applied the cream for 10 days now which is very unexpected.\u00a0 Unsure of related to the Reuteri but early research suggests that it may be.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI would say that so far this method does appear to work anecdotally.\u00a0 I have not measured Reuteri in my fecal matter (unsure if there is even facilities to test where I am living presently) so this is all very anecdotal, but I am feeling/noticing the above effects, some a surprise so I suspect something is going on here with the Reuteri and why not as the drops alone works for babies. Add to this a higher dose than babies, plus all the prebiotics I am eating, I suspect the Reuteri is growing in my small intestines.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnyone struggling with the yogurt method might find this easier and if you do eat probiotics, you will essentially be fermenting right in the spot your body needs it.\u00a0 In fact I suspect that unless you take antibiotics or other meds/foods that kill gut bacteria that one could maintain their Reuteri colony by just eating right.\u00a0 I say this as I did read studies that showed those in non industrialized places had Reuteri in their fecal matter suggesting it thrives just fine once established provided you eat naturally.\n\nI will update again in another week or so as by then I would have had about 15 ml of the drops or so.\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to ask me questions."]}

Do you just take it out, use some liquid (even though there aren't any bubbles), feed it and put it back in the fridge? Do you let it warm up to room temperature and wait for it to become active again? Do you feed it and leave it on the counter?\n\nAnother question, do you burp your bottles? Why or why not? And how often?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice! :) \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1jota5c/ginger_bug_advice/", "created_utc": 1743506998.0, "score": 3, "author": "histam_ine", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jota5c/ginger_bug_advice/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I personally don\u2019t put my gingerbug in the fridge at all and just feed it daily equal parts ginger with sugar\u2026 with a cheese cloth on top.

{"title": "Let's talk brine", "selftext": "I'm a newcomer to this community. I had the idea to make my own fermented pickles. I went on a deep dive on processes and methods and pretty quickly discovered a divide in methodology regarding brine and salinity percentage calculations. Brine solution with just water weight vs. total weight of organic material (food + water). Searching through this subreddit, this seems to pop up fairly frequently. I've read various posts here and watched a few YouTube videos (Alton Brown's Good Eats pickles episode [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4SKZ9BF2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4SKZ9BF2c) and Brad from Bon Appetit's pickles [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6XWXj9l8Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6XWXj9l8Q) ). In the videos, they don't measure the weight of the food. But people on this subreddit insist on including the weight of the food. Calculating salinity based on the weight of the water AND the food makes the most sense to me. I guess I'm wondering, methodology-wise, if we are immersing food in a solution with a given salinity, or, are we achieving an end result with a given salinity. Those are two very different things.\n\nThat said, I'm no food scientist. But this is science. I'm not concerned with comments about overthinking. I WANT THE TRUTH! Can anyone tell me, definitively, which method is correct?

Too salty. \n\nI also noticed majority of people who insist on total weight brine are new to fermentation and don't know any better because they're scared/been scared by \"guides\" to try anything else.

For fermentation I'll be using 20g of salt, which is 2% of the total mass of the jar.\nNow we know we should be using 2 to 5% salt for fermentation.\nWith all the advanced knowledge I have, I know that once I add vegetables to the jar and top off with liquid, it will have a total mass of about 950 grams. That means I'm well over that 2% salt if I continue to add 20g of salt to the jar.\n\nNow chill in this sub and stay nice.", "I look at it like this.

Water weight percentage method was more sensitive to packing density and brine fill. Total weight is more consistent.\n\nI switched to total weight method a few years ago and it's worked out better.\n\n2.5% salt by total weight tastes too salty to me. When I used to do 3.5% by brine, some batches would ferment quicker and degrade. Other times they were a little saltier.\n\nAt 3.5% by water weight, I had to hard-stop everything by 8 or 9 days or they'd quickly degrade and get too mushy.\n\nAt 2.1% by total weight, I soak in ice water and then ferment for 10-12 days, sometimes longer. It hits the perfect balance between taste, control, and quality.\n\nI grow my own cucumbers in the summer, make fermented pickles, and refrigerate them. With the total weight method, I have less waste, and am certain to meet a minimum salinity target.", "Because cucumbers and most produce is over 90% water, if you only measure salt based on the liquid/water, you will get a large amount of variation in salinity depending on the ratio of produce to brine. So using the overall weight makes it more consistent, though you need to adjust percentages downward when switching.", "[deleted]"]}

Anyhow, here is how I made mine:\n\nI actually started mine the same time I made a batch of kimchi because doing a batch of kimchi gave me my starter   vegetable scraps.  So,  I used NAPA cabbage leaves and daikon for scrap vegetables.  I wrapped up the bran in my outer (salted, wilted) cabbage leaves like a package and then buried it back into the bran bed.  I used the same vegetables for 3-4 days each, which I think is important because it gives the vegetables time to ferment (sort of like kimchi does)....  \n  \nTo \"get things going\",  I did use some miso paste (one a barley soy miso, another white miso) and a little beer (about 1/3 cup) and after a week or so I DID use about a tablespoon of sauerkraut juice from a new batch (2 weeks old).\n\nOther things I put in my bran bed were: english mustard powder, kombu pieces, ginger slices, and outer part of dried red chili peppers.  Two weeks later, I added dried shitake mushrooms and a couple garlic cloves (take out and replace periodically).\n\nThe hard thing is that you have to turn your bed daily for like 2 weeks - and then every day thereafter (In summer/hot weather you will have to do this 2ce a day).  Now, that isn't so hard, and it's kind of fun like playing in the sand - but your pickles won't be coming out well for some time....  \n  \nFor a long time, the pickles are so salty...so don't get discouraged.   Keep at it - You have to be very very patient because it will take almost a month to get it working really well.\n\nHope that helps somehow....have a lot of fun with your project."]}

My gut feeling is telling me that there is a microbial inhibitor somewhere which is preventing the start up phase of fermentation process.\n\nThings I would check:\n\n1. Something in/not in the water - Tap water (with chlorine/ozone) or distilled water (which lacks additional inorganic elements needed for some biochemical processes of the microbes) can potentially stall a ferment. In some seasons such as spring, tap water tends to be heavily chlorinated to account for run off. Some water purifiers also use silver coils/nano particles, where the remaining silver ions in the water can have antimicrobial properties.  You can eliminate this variable by relying on a dry ferment (as is the case traditionally with sauerkraut), or using bottled mineral water if you want to brine it.\n2. A microbial inhibitor on the vegetables - Again highly highly unlikely. Try using organic produce.  Try using some other veggies instead of cabbage (carrots, radishes, beans, cauliflowers, fruits, etc). And wash the veggies with just water.\n3. A microbial inhibitor in the salt, or too much salt - Bromine\u00a0*or*\u00a0iodine compounds found in salt tends to have antimicrobial properties. Sometimes anti-caking agents in salt can also interfere with fermentation. It is also is to best to keep the total salt concentration at somewhere around 2% (in relation to total weight of fluid and solids).  The additive issue can be eliminated by using a \"Pickling Salt\" which basically pure NaCl. I would also buy a much more accurate digital scale if you are fermenting small quantities, since most kitchen scales tend to have quite large errors (even as large as +/- 2g) and this can easily lead you to overshoot.\n4. A microbial inhibitor on the glass, tools, or your hands - Sometimes soaps contain additives like Triclosan which are antimicrobial. Alternatively just soaps/surfactants themselves can also be antimicrobial by disrupting bacterial cell membranes. I have seen cases where some cutting boards are also impregnated with antimicrobial substances to prevent odors. This can be eliminated by using some different tools and switching to a different soap, and making sure to rinse everything toughly with water before using them.\n5. Wrong temperature - Again this should slow down the ferment but not completely stall it. Aim for average room temp as a baseline (21C), but anything you find comfortable to be in would also be comfortable for the bacteria.\n\nI suggest at this time, ditching this current ferment, eliminating all the variables, and trying again using a validated recipe. This one is the simplest and most concise I have seen [https://youtube.com/shorts/AmIjczutV0c?si=-g38oTM4JCPMj\\_8i](https://youtube.com/shorts/AmIjczutV0c?si=-g38oTM4JCPMj_8i)", "If you didn't see CO2 bubbles forming in the kraut after a day or two, something went wrong.\n\nI usually go 2% salt/cabbage weight. Cover and press down with a couple of the large, outer cabbage leaves. Then I top off with brine at 1t diamond crystal kosher salt/cup of water. \n\nFind a smaller jar that fits in your fermenting jar, fill it with water and use that to hold the kraut under the brine. Put a light cloth over the top of everything and secure it with a rubber band around the neck of the jar. \n\nShould your brine level go down for whatever reason, just top it off with water.

That\u2019s 170 mM NaCl solution , just a bit more than a physiologique solution. 2.5% its almost 0.5M solution, its a lot of salt.

Like others have said, it\u2019s ready when you say it\u2019s ready but in my one experience so far it can take a looooong time", "could you share your recipe for making the soda? my first attempt at making an orange juice soda didn't have any carbonation. the issues could range from the temperature at your house, how much sugar you used as food for the ginger bug, how active your ginger bug was, whether your bottles are properly sealed or not, and how often you're burping your sodas. i burped a pineapple soda every day for five days and it lost carbonation.", "Have you been burping the bottle each day? How is that going? Does it 'pop' loudly, or just hiss a little?", "Can't say about OJ, but I've got an apple one on the go right now. For each bottle I used 375g Egremont Russet Apple (sweet) juice and 40g ginger bug topped up with a little more sweet ginger tea. Within about 12 hours it went insanely fizzy. It could not be burped it often enough. I ended up putting it in the fridge by the end of the day in an attempt to slow it down a bit and, even then, I still had to pour some off to be able to let the pressure out. It's now four days later and they're still in the fridge. I'm still burping them fairly regularly and the fizziness is finally starting to come under control, with a better flavour balance between sweetness and dryness.", "I think you've left too much headspace  so not enough carbon dioxide has been forced to be absorbed by the liquid. I'd wager its as 'ready' as it will get. Refrigerate first for the maximum amount bubbles to be absorbed before drinking. \n\nI have written a [ginger bug guide ](https://www.reddit.com/r/homepreserving/s/yqXzPImbiY) with some FAQs you might find useful \n\nOrange is a risky ferment, both for taste and texture. It can come out rancid or overly foamy. You'll find most sodas are mixed mainly with apple juice and a small amount of the secondary flavour."]}

{"title": "Experimenting with Cultured Breastmilk-turned into a Viili like starter", "selftext": "I decided to make my own starter culture without a commercial starter or premade product. I read all about how beneficial raw milk is and how many strains of probiotics are in raw milk. It can make a great yogurt/cheese starter culture. The only issue is I don't have easy access to raw milk. Except my own breastmilk that is. I don't produce much anymore but I was able to get 3/4 oz. I split that into 2 jars. One is my mesophilic ferment, and the second is my thermophilic ferment. The Thermo I keep in my Instant Pot on regular mode basically 24/7 (temp ranges 104-107F). The Meso I keep on the counter at room temperature ~72F. They've only been going since 3/28 (2 days now) I've been \"feeding\" them both with a little bit of heated whole milk. The Meso isn't doing much but the Thermobresembles Vili! Very stringy and sweet smelling.\nApparently breastmilk has a lot more strains of probiotics than raw cows milk and is a fantastic way to start any kind of dairy culture especially for human consumption. As I mentioned before, I barely produce milk anymore as my youngest is 2.5 years old and nurses infrequently, so I can't just use more breastmilk to feed the culture. By culturing raw breastmilk and feeding it pasteurized whole milk, those breastmilk cultures inoculate the whole milk without the need of large quantities of breastmilk!\nIt appears it's going to work out beautifully and can't wait to see what kinds of yogurts and cheeses I can make with my 2 cultures!
