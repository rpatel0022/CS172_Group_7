Preheat your oven to 110\u00b0C (not fan-bake). Line a baking tray with baking paper.\nIn a large metal, ceramic, or glass bowl (not plastic), beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks (speed 2).\n\n2. Continue beating while gradually adding Caster Sugar, a quarter of a cup at a time. (Speed 6) The mixture will become glossier and thicker with each addition, and then continue mixing (Speed 10) until very thick and glossy; this process should take approximately 10 minutes). Finally, (speed 1) incorporate the vanilla extract, vinegar, and Cornflour - Don\u2019t overmix just until incorporated. (Optional but recommended- carefully pour 1 teaspoon boiling water down side mixing bowl and mix in). \n\n3. Spoon the mixture onto the prepared tray into a mound that is approximately dinner plate sized. (My tip is to draw circle from suitable sized upturned bowl on baking paper). \n\n4. Bake for approximately 1 1/2 hours, until the meringue is dry, crisp, (do not open oven while cooking). \n\n5. !! IMPORTANT!! Turn off the oven and leave the pavlova inside for at least an hour before removing it from the oven. Then, allow it to cool completely on a wire rack before transferring it to an airtight container.\n\n6. To serve, place the pavlova on a serving plate.

Overall, people loved the basil (its a really strong contender for pistachio and I strongly recommend it, pairs very well with an olive oil cake) and the white pepper (which is really just fior di late or zabaglione ice cream with a warmth of white pepper at the end, not overpowering at all, pairs incredibly with panettone). The chestnut one was mid but I definitely underestimated the amount of sugar needed and might try again but it was good not great. The Gorgonzola was fabulous for me but not loved by everyone. \n\n\nI\u2019m making for my friends a cereal milk flavour (think of the flavour of the milk after you\u2019d eat a bowl of cereal, like the flavour of the milk after the cereal had been sitting in it for a while). It is - according to all my friends - an exact flavour match and is extremely good (its still freezing so we won\u2019t know for certain if it\u2019s great until later. \n\n\nBut we want to make another flavour - what are some niche sweet flavours you like that would be similar to cereal milk? Think of something not so obvious or appreciated similar to cereal milk but still good. One guy recommended Oreo cream but to me that\u2019s too obvious as it is part of the Oreo. One recommended the crispy part of a dish of Mac and cheese but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d make that and honestly it sounds straight up gross. \n\n\nWhat are some flavours that are nostalgic or special for you that are under appreciated or non obvious like cereal milk is?

The breakdown is the base is graham and butter, the middle is raspberry puree with 8oz cream cheese, little key lime extract and some icing sugar.

So my science question is I found I had a mass inconsistency in melting/thawing points in my three layers.  I froze the cheesecake and graham together before adding the melted chocolate then freezing again but to serve has been tricky because the chocolate stays very hard and frozen and the graham at a medium density.  In a very short time from removal from the freezer (fridge not much help) the cheesecake portion softens to the point where if you try and fork it you end up smushing the center out the sides.  I did not think I used an excessive amount of chocolate for the top and perhaps a fudge drizzle may be a better companion texture.

Searched up some recipes and gave it a try.  The biggest challenge was I live in a country without heavy cream but I found two extremely similar recipes that used regular whipping cream instead so I gave that a try.  My ashta was extremely bland.  The only taste it had was the rose water which was overpowering. (Both my husband and I thought it tasted like old lady perfume) Switching to orange blossom water for the next attempt.  But having only ever tasted the proper item once I'm just not sure what else to change.  Any suggestions are welcome, I'm making another small batch tomorrow.\n\nCurrent recipe:\n1/2 liter milk\n1/2 liter whipping cream\n3/4 cup cornstarch \n1/2 cup sugar\n1 Tablespoon rose water\n\nI want it a little richer.  Should I just switch out half of the milk for that much more whipping cream or is there something else that would be better?  Or is it supposed to be fairly bland and I was just so overall impressed with my first one that I didn't notice the individual flavors enough?  Sadly the restaurant is too far away to go back to just to sample the pastry again.\n\nAnd anyone that sees this and is inspired to try something new, definitely do it.  It was surprisingly simple to do despite the super long directions for how to do it.

Then, gradually increase the speed, and beat until medium stiff peaks start to form. Be careful not to overmix, or the filling will curdle!\u00a0\n\nFor the more traditional tiramisu recipes, I you'd whip the egg whites, yolks and heavy cream all separately and then mixing it all together.

It's relatively thick, but still too liquidy for the tiramisu. All the ingredients I used were cold, except for the vanilla pudding (and sugar).\n\nI was going to buy more ingredients and try again, but I want to see if there's a way to save the filling I made so it doesn't go to waste.   \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dessert/comments/1jebrdy/tiramisu_filling_is_a_bit_too_liquid_and_wont/", "created_utc": 1742321827.0, "score": 7, "author": "Embarrassed-Deal-157", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/dessert/comments/1jebrdy/tiramisu_filling_is_a_bit_too_liquid_and_wont/", "html_title": ""}

You can usually find them frozen too if not in season. 1 cup granulated sugar1/4 cup cornstarch2 tablespoons lemon juice1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 9-inch refrigerated pie crusts 3 tablespoons heavy cream\n\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook cherries & sugar, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. \nIn small bowl, stir together cornstarch, lemon juice and salt until smooth. Fold into warm cherries. Cook 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until mixture is very thick. Remove from heat.  \nPress 1 pie crust into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Pour the cherry mixture into prepared crust. Bottom crust does not need to be pre baked. \nUnroll remaining piecrust onto lightly floured surface. Using pastry wheel or paring knife, cut into 1\u201d strips.  Weave strips in lattice pattern onto the cherry mixture. Trim the pastry strips even with the pie pan, and press the edges of the crusts together. Fold the edges under. I like to do a Thumb Crimp around the border.  Nice and even.  Brush the lattice with heavy cream. \n\nBake for 20-25 minutes, until the filling is hot and bubbly and the crust is browned. Let cool for at least 1 hour before slicing.  \nWhipped cream or Ice Cream optional!!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/obxxdqbj9noe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1741953309.0, "score": 192, "author": "KarinsDogs", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/dessert/comments/1jb2551/cherry_pie_for_pi_day_made_one_to_share_with_my/", "html_title": ""}

Preheat your oven to 110\u00b0C (not fan-bake). Line a baking tray with baking paper.\nIn a large metal, ceramic, or glass bowl (not plastic), beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks (speed 2).\n\n2. Continue beating while gradually adding Caster Sugar, a quarter of a cup at a time. (Speed 6) The mixture will become glossier and thicker with each addition, and then continue mixing (Speed 10) until very thick and glossy; this process should take approximately 10 minutes). Finally, (speed 1) incorporate the vanilla extract, vinegar, and Cornflour - Don\u2019t overmix just until incorporated. (Optional but recommended- carefully pour 1 teaspoon boiling water down side mixing bowl and mix in). \n\n3. Spoon the mixture onto the prepared tray into a mound that is approximately dinner plate sized. (My tip is to draw circle from suitable sized upturned bowl on baking paper). \n\n4. Bake for approximately 1 1/2 hours, until the meringue is dry, crisp, (do not open oven while cooking). \n\n5. !! IMPORTANT!! Turn off the oven and leave the pavlova inside for at least an hour before removing it from the oven. Then, allow it to cool completely on a wire rack before transferring it to an airtight container.\n\n6. To serve, place the pavlova on a serving plate. Swirl the whipped cream on top with a spatula and decorate with sliced or chopped fruit of your choice.\n\nEnjoy! \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/c5y40s1he39e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1735175114.0, "score": 14, "author": "Notypicalblonde", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/dessert/comments/1hmddf3/first_time_making_pavlova_not_decorated_pic/", "html_title": ""}

The breakdown is the base is graham and butter, the middle is raspberry puree with 8oz cream cheese, little key lime extract and some icing sugar.

So my science question is I found I had a mass inconsistency in melting/thawing points in my three layers.  I froze the cheesecake and graham together before adding the melted chocolate then freezing again but to serve has been tricky because the chocolate stays very hard and frozen and the graham at a medium density.  In a very short time from removal from the freezer (fridge not much help) the cheesecake portion softens to the point where if you try and fork it you end up smushing the center out the sides.  I did not think I used an excessive amount of chocolate for the top and perhaps a fudge drizzle may be a better companion texture.
