This was my first time piping with a tip and not using a ziplock bag so be gentle lol\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h0jvrm", "created_utc": 1732648024.0, "score": 1010, "author": "TheRealShackleford", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/dessert/comments/1h0jvrm/dark_chocolate_raspberry_cupcakes_for_my_wife/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Congrats to the whole family \u2728 You baking, you baking cupcakes for your wife, you baking cupcakes for your wife with that chocolate - warms the heart!

Wow!", "This is the content I signed up for", "OMG!! Why didn\u2019t I think of this ??!! The crust is lowkey my favorite part ! I\u2019m so making this", "Here\u2019s the recipe if you want to avoid cookies, etc.:\n\ningredient :\n\nCrusts:\n\n1 box of graham crackers (about 27 graham crackers), crushed into fine crumbs\n\n1/2 C light brown sugar\n\n1 C salted butter, melted\n\nCake:\n\n2 C heavy whipping cream\n\n3 (8oz) packages cream cheese, room temperature\n\n1/2 C sugar\n\n1/4 C sour cream\n\n2 tbsp powdered sugar\n\n2 tbsp cornstarch (or more powdered sugar)\n\n2 tsp lemon juice\n\n1/2 tbsp vanilla extract\n\ndirection :\n\nBegin by making the crust mixture. Combine the ingredients together until all the crumbs are evenly saturated in butter. Pour half into the bottom of a 9\u2033 springform pan and pack it in. Use the bottom of a dry measuring cup to make sure it\u2019s really tight \u2013 if it\u2019s too lose it\u2019ll just crumble when you try to slice it. Place the springform pan in the freezer to set, and the other half of crust aside on the counter.\nUsing a hand mixer or stand mixer, whip your heavy cream for 2 minutes on medium high, then add 2 tbsp of powdered sugar or cornstarch to stabilize. Continue whipping until the cream forms stiff peaks, about 4-5 minutes more.\n\nAlso using a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go, and mix until totally combined.\n\nAdd the sour cream, vanilla, lemon, and remaining powered sugar. Beat on high until smooth and fluffy.\n\nFold in half of the whipped cream, gently, then fold in the other half. Remove the bottom crust from the fridge.\n\nPour the filling into the pan and smooth it in. You\u2019ll need to press it down as you smooth it out to prevent pockets of air, and to make it fit. Remember that there needs to be room for the top crust.\n\nOnce the filling has been smoothed out, use a spoon to sprinkle over half of the remaining crumbs. Use the back of the spoon to smooth them out over the top of the cheesecake while pressing down gently. Add the remaining crumbs, and continue to smooth and press. You might have too many crumbs, but that\u2019s OK. Try to press them in as tightly as you can.\nUse a piece of parchment paper to cover the top of the cheesecake and now press down firmly with your hands. Wrap the springform pan entirely in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.\nSlice and serve. I like fresh strawberries on the side.\n\nNOTES\nYou can use a whisk and your arms if you\u2019ve got more stamina than I do.\nYou can buy already made graham cracker crumbs in most grocery stores, but I crush mine in my food processor.\nStabilizing the whipped cream (adding the powdered sugar or cornstarch) is optional but may help the cheesecake retain its shape after slicing (and the temperature increasing) for longer.", "BRILLIANT!", "Holy shit", "Mmmm my kind of cheesecake!!", "Fucking GENIUS.", "I love the crust so this is a dream. \ud83d\ude0d", "Would this technically be considered to be a cheesecake sandwich?

Once they were defrosted, I added \u00bd a cup of raw sugar and \u2153 cup of cornstarch, and the zest of a lemon and tossed the blueberries in that. I filled the pie with the mound of blueberries and added the lattice. I know some people tuck the lattice underneath the crust edge, but I chose to roll the edge over on top to seal the lattice in place instead  to create a thicker crust edge instead. Then I used a fork to crimp the thick crust.\n\nI added an egg white wash on the lattice and crust edge, then sprinkled more raw sugar on top.\n\nI baked it at 400^o for about 25 minutes. Then I added a heat shield around the edge of the crust made of strips of aluminum foil to prevent the crust from getting too dark. Baked it for another 40 minutes at 375^o. Then I checked the temperature of the center with a thermometer. I was trying to reach 180-200^o in the center. I just kept putting the pie back in for another 10 minute increment and checked the temperature again. I tried that twice, but it wasn\u2019t getting there, so I raised the temperature back to 400^o and baked it for one last 10 minute increment and it finally reached 180^o in the center.\n\nWhen it was finally done, I let it cool for 3-4 hrs before cutting into it.

In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add water and honey, and then mix to create a stiff dough. Then gradually add water.\n2. Place the dough on the counter and knead until it\u2019s smooth and supple. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n3. After 30 minutes, split the dough into 4 pieces. Get one piece, then roll through a pasta machine. Roll using the widest setting, then fold in half and roll again. Do the same on each dough. Repeat this process until you create smooth sheets by gradually decreasing the width on each roll.\n4. When the sheet is at 1mm thick, lay it on the surface and apply a thin layer of lard or butter. Create thin sheets of the other doughs as well and roll them into similar thin layers.\n5. Roll up the first thin sheet to create a tight sausage shape.\n6. Next, wrap the next thin dough sheet around the original sausage shape pastry dough, layering up to create one large cylinder. Cover with a saran wrap and chill for 1 to 2 hours for the pastry to firm up.\n7. Now, to make the filling. Place the milk, sugar, and salt in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. Add the semolina flour until it thickens and becomes smooth. After it has cooled down, transfer to a bowl. Then, add the remaining ingredients, stirring all the while to create a smooth, thick filling. Set aside, preferably inside the fridge.\n8. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.\n9. Bring out the pastry roll and cut them into 1 cm-thick pieces. Use your fingers, greased with lard or butter, to make an impression on the center to create a cone shape.\n10. Get the filling and scoop a spoonful into the hollow and press the edges of the pastry together to lock. Repeat these for the rest, and line up all pastries on the tray.\n11. When you\u2019re done putting filling on all the dough pieces, bake the pastries for about 30 minutes.\n12. When done, allow to cool for only a couple of minutes before sprinkling them with confectioner\u2019s sugar. Serve immediately.", "I was just thinking about making these.. then BAM.. I see this post.. it's a sign!  Well done!", "My favourite pastry of all. These are not easy, but look glorious, OP! Nice job."]}

How was the crunch and syrup balance?", "1. Thaw phyllo dough according to package instructions (this is best done overnight in the fridge, then place it on the counter for 1 hour before starting your recipe to bring it to room temp).\n\n2. Trim phyllo dough to fit your baking sheet. My phyllo dough package had 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets that measured 9\u00d714 so I had to trim them slightly. You can trim one stack at a time then cover with a damp towel to keep from drying out.\n\n3. Butter the bottom and sides of a 13\u00d79 non-stick baking pan.\nStart with your honey sauce (which will need time to cool as your baklava bakes).\n\n1. In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup honey, 2 Tbsp lemon juice, and 3/4 cup water. Bring to a boil over med/high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then reduce heat to med/low and boil an additional 4 minutes without stirring. Remove from heat and let syrup cool while preparing baklava\n\nHow to Assemble Baklava:\n\nPreheat Oven to 325\u02daF.\n\n1. Pulse walnuts about 10 times in a food processor until coarsely ground/ finely chopped. In a medium bowl, stir together: 4 cups finely chopped walnuts and 1 tsp cinnamon\n\nPlace 10 phyllo sheets into baking pan one at a time, brushing each sheet with butter once it\u2019s in the pan before adding the next (i.e. place phyllo sheet into pan, brush the top with butter, place next phyllo sheet in pan, butter the top, etc. etc.).\n\nKeep remaining phyllo covered with a damp towel at all times. Spread about 1/5 of nut mixture (about 3/4 cup) over phyllo dough.\n\nAdd 5 buttered sheets of phyllo, then another layer of nuts. Repeat x 4. Finish off with 10 layers of buttered phyllo sheets. Brush the very top with butter.\n\nHere\u2019s the order:\n10 buttered phyllo sheets, 3/4 cup nut mixture,\n5 buttered phyllo sheets, 3/4 cup nut mixture,\n5 buttered phyllo sheets, 3/4 cup nut mixture,\n5 buttered phyllo sheets, 3/4 cup nut mixture,\n5 buttered phyllo sheets, 3/4 cup nut mixture\n10 buttered phyllo sheets and butter the top.\n\n4. Cut pastry into 1 1/2\u2033 wide strips, then cut diagonally to form diamond shapes. Bake at 325\u02daF for 1 hour and 15 min or until tops are golden brown\n\nRemove from oven and immediately spoon the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava (you\u2019ll hear it sizzle). This will ensure that it stays crisp rather than soggy. Let baklava cool completely, uncovered and at room temperature\n\nTip: For best results, let baklava sit 4-6 hours or overnight at room temperature for the syrup to penetrate and soften the layers. Garnish baklava with finely chopped nuts or drizzle with melted chocolate. Store at room temp, covered with a tea towel for 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nIf using pistachios with walnuts use a 1:1 ratio", "Can you share the ingredients etc?

Turn off the oven and leave cheesecake in with oven door closed for 1 hour.

Cook for 3-5 min or until very bubbly, then stir in cinnamon, heavy whipping cream and chopped, toasted pecans. Cool to room temperature. \n2.

So I created a recipe with that new bit of knowledge.\n\nIngredients:\n\n- Fully baked pie shell\n\n- 4 egg yolks\n\n- \u00bc cup cornstarch\n\n- 4 tbsp butter\n\n- 1 cup of brown sugar\n\n- 2 tsp of sea salt\n\n- 2 \u00bd cups of milk\n\n- \u00bd cup of heavy cream\n\n- Splash of vanilla\n\nCombine the egg yolks and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. In a separate sauce pan, melt the butter and brown sugar on medium heat until it\u2019s hot a bubbling. Be careful not to burn yourself. Mix constantly with a wooden spatula, scraping the bottom as it cooks for a few minutes until all the sugar is fully melted. Add the salt. DO NOT FORGET THE SALT!!!\n\nMake sure to continuously mix as the sugar caramelizes. Do not burn the sugar. When it begins bubbling, you can add the milk and cream, continuously mixing. The sugar mixture and the milk won\u2019t want to mix at first, but slowly the sugar mixture will dissolve as the milk heats up. By the time it all begins to boil, everything will be dissolved. Lower the heat to low so the mixture is simmering. Pour a half cup into the egg yolk/cornstarch mixture in the mixing bowl to temper the yolks and whisk vigorously to thin it out and avoid cooking the yolks. Add another half cup to thin it out enough to pour everything back into the sauce pan. Now pour it all into the saucepan. Everything will thicken very quickly. Continue to simmer for two more minutes while constantly whisking to ensure all the cornstarch gets actives from the heat. Remove from heat. Add in the splash of vanilla and whisk it in. Pour the pudding into a fully cooked pie shell. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap to avoid a milk skin from forming on the pudding and chill in the fridge for 3-4 hours to set. The plastic wrap should be touching the surface like in the photo that I posted.\n\nAfter chilling, you can serve as is. I topped mine with whipped cream (with a spoonful of sugar to sweeten it) and some chopped bitter dark chocolate chips. You don\u2019t need to do that. I just had some extra heavy cream and chocolate chips to use up.\n\nThis was a last minute test recipe I randomly came up with because I couldn\u2019t find a recipe online that didn\u2019t include a box mix. I\u2019m sure improvements can be made.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been thinking about ways to improve the recipe. Rather than increase the brown sugar or butter for a stronger butterscotch flavor, I think instead, I would replace the heavy cream in the butterscotch filling with a can of sweetened condensed milk.\n\nI guess now I know what I\u2019ll be doing next time I make this.", "It looks really good :)", "holy moly that looks decadent \ud83d\ude0d", "So Sweet and Amazingly Delicious \ud83e\udd5b", "Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!!

Holiday baking is truly a labor of love as much as it is a tradition that is filled with old and new memories. I started baking these Raspberry Bow Tie Cookies years ago.

Mix flour, cocoa powder, sugar, salt in a large bowl. Mix in butter and egg. Mix until the butter is crumbly. Mix in marsala wine in smaller amouns at a time until the dough is formed. To make a soft doughy mixture, you may need to add some more wine.\n2. The dough should be taken out of the bowl. Knead the dough for 10 minutes on a floured surface. Form the dough into a ball. Transfer to a bowl. Let the dough rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. Be sure to cover it.\n3. To heat a large saucepan with vegetable oil, heat it to 340 \u2013 355. Half of the dough should be used at the time. Keep the other half in the bowl. Roll the dough thinly onto a floured surface. A pasta machine or a rolling pin can be used to make the dough thin.\n4. Cut the dough into rounds using a 4-inch cookie cutter or a shape of a cup. You can wrap individual dough circles around to form cannoli shape. Brush about 1 inch or less of the one end with beaten eggs (use your fingertip or pastry brush). To seal the dough around the cannoli mold, press the edge on the opposite side.\n5. Use metal tongs to carefully place the shell into the oil. Fry until crisp and golden brown, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Be sure to monitor oil temperature so that oil doesn\u2019t burn shells. You can fry as many as 5-6 shells at once.\n6. Use metal tongs to remove the cannoli shells from the oil. Once you have removed the shell, let it drain into the pot. Then move to paper towels and drain. Wrap a paper towel around the cannoli shell and slide it off.\n7. Allow cannoli shells to cool, then continue the process with the remaining dough circles. Use the flour scraps to shake off any excess flour, then press together, place in a bowl, and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before reusing.\u00a0\n8. Let cool on a wire rack, then fill with cannoli filling. Decorate as desired with melted chocolate, chopped pistachios, or mini chocolate chips.\nCANNOLI FILLING\n1. The ricotta can be whipped with a mixer or by hand. It should take about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the powdered sugar to the ricotta. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to gently fold the powdered sugar into the ricotta. Continue this process until it is smooth and well combined. If desired, add the chocolate chips.\n2. Move the filling to a piping bag with a large, round tip. Pipe in the filling into the cooled cannoli shells. You can also use a spoon, an ordinary plastic bag, and then cut the tip.\n3. Place the ricotta mixture in a pastry bag. Squeeze the fillings into each cannoli shell from both sides. Enjoy!\nNOTES\n* To make the best Sicilian Cannoli,\u00a0 let the ricotta mixture rest in the refrigerator for 24 hours, or at least overnight.\u00a0\n* It is easier to make the Ricotta mixture for Sicilian Cannoli using an electric mixer, but don\u2019t! Use your hands, otherwise, it could turn out watery, and you\u2019ll need to add more sugar to thicken it.\u00a0", "[Link to Sicilian Cannoli Recipe](https://cookingfrog.com/famous-sicilian-cannoli-authentic-recipe/)", "Looks stunning", "I need to buy this right now !!"]}

Add the yeast mixture, flour, butter, salt, and remaining sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and start on low speed, working up to medium speed to combine the dough. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is soft and elastic. Place the dough in a large, lightly greased mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free environment for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.\r  \n\r  \nCustard : Whisk the sugar, salt, and cornstarch together. Beat the egg yolks ina medium-sized mixing bowl just until smooth. Add the dry mixture tothe egg yolks and continue to beat until combined and pale yellow,about 1 minute. Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it comes to a bare simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully ladle the milk into the egg yolk mixture while whisking vigorously to avoid lumps. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and return it to the stovetop over medium heat. While continuously whisking, heat the mixture until bubbling and completely thickened. Remove the pot from the heat. Whisk the vanilla and butter into the custard until smooth, then transfer the custard to a bowl. Cover the custard with plastic wrap, carefully pressing the plastic directly against the surface of the custard to avoid a skin forming. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until completely cooled. Punch the risen dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out until about 1/2\u2033 thick. Use a 3\u2033 biscuit or cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough. Knead the remaining dough back into a ball and continue to roll it out and cut rounds until you\u2019ve used as much dough as you can. Place the rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving about 1\u2033 of room between each round. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow them to rise for 20-30 minutes, or until doubled in size. Heat the oil in a large pot to 360F. Carefully place the rounds into the hot oil, working in batches. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown, flip and cook for another minute or until golden. Remove the rounds with a slotted spoon and allow the donuts to drain on a paper towel-lined plate while you fry the rest.", "Sounds awesome. Thanks"]}

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Spray a 9x5-inch metal loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper, then spray the pan again.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Let sit for at least 10 minutes while you proceed with the recipe. (It will curdle; that\u2019s okay.)\n3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the 2 cups flour, baking soda, and salt. In a small bowl, toss the blueberries with the remaining teaspoon of flour. Set both aside.\n4. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or beaters), cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again. With the mixer on low speed, beat in a third of the flour mixture, then half of the milk mixture. Beat in another third of the flour mixture, then the remaining milk mixture, followed by the remaining flour mixture, scraping the bowl as necessary. Add the flour-dusted blueberries to the batter and, using a spatula, fold until evenly combined.\n5. Transfer the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.\n6. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, (I did 55 minutes) until the cake is golden brown and a tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.\n7. When the cake is cool, transfer it to a serving platter.\n8. Make the glaze: In a small bowl, mix together the confectioners\u2019 sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar or lemon juice as necessary to make a thick but pourable glaze (it should be a little thicker than you\u2019d think, about the consistency of molasses or honey) (We made it thinner than honey. You can add a tsp milk). Spoon the glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. (We used a ziplock bag to pipe it onto the loaf). Let the glaze set for 10 to 15 minutes before serving: You\u2019ll need 2 large lemons for the entire recipe. Be sure to zest them before you juice them.", "yumm looks great!", "Oh god please give us the recipe", "Beautiful!", "Looks great \ud83d\udc4d", "Looks good", " looks amazing \ud83e\udd24"]}

It's better and DAMN that pie looks too good to eat! \n\nI'd say consider also using the negative space in the plate more. So maybe some sauce could be placed around the pie/cheesecake rather than always underneath. Or have part of the pie resting on the sauce while most of the sauce is visible around it. Because having all the sauce to complement the pie/cheesecake under the pie/cheesecake hides it away rather than adding to the dish. And the fruits as well.  So that way you use the space a bit better while still keeping the pies/cheesecake as the center piece \n\nWhat I think works is that you've kept it simple and used garnishes that are different textures and different heights and shapes to the pie that makes it look very interesting already\n\nWith the first strawberry cheesecake that one I'd say you could have some fruit on top as well since its flat to add more dimension.\n\nThe second one doesn't need that because it has a beautiful texture from the meringue and great call on the mint on top! But that one I'd love to see a sauce that complements in colour to that bright yellow! The red while it looks good doesn't perfectly go with it due to the contrasting colours like the red, blue and yellow.\n\nBut again, you did really great!"]}

This is my order: 2,3,1,4\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of 4. 2 looks very playful, 3 kind of cleaner, also easier to do. 1 maybe more centered? But great job \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "1,2,3,4 for me", "1 looks the best, but I\u2019m sure they all taste great. \n\nBoth 1 & 4 provide a square element to the round plate/rounded pastry combo, which makes the plating more visually interesting than round on round on round. \n\n1\u2019s base garnish shape is subtle, but it creates a pleasing rectangular on the plate that sort of mimics the soft curves of the pastry and plate, itself. It\u2019s also cool to have the curd spread thin enough to be opaque in spots. Would like to see that aspect defined a bit more. Consider different applicators; a coarse pastry brush usually provides a cool swipe pattern in viscus fluids. \n\n1 also utilizes the rule-of-three/odds with its garnish, which looks nice, however, substituting a garnish like candied lemon, or a cool-shaped tuile, etc. for the crumb+meringue would add some differentiating texture. I like the little yellow orbs (lemon \u2018caviar\u2019?) on the tart, and that cigarette looks nice. Very neat piping, and good toasting. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go a little heavier on the torch , though. The darker meringue will differentiate itself from the crust color (and slightly match the plate, which could be pretty cool), and the deeper caramelized sugars will complement the lemon flavor. \n\n2 is cute, but a little composed for my taste. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a composed-style of plating, other than it can take more time than the looser alternative. It may feel sloppier in contrast, but I think there is a certain charm to looser plating. There\u2019s a little spirit and playfulness in each plate because none of them look 100% like the other(s). \n\nThe swoosh on 3 is nice. Could be cool to add another color/flavor sauce inside/outside the swoosh for some depth, and making it a bit off-center on the plate would add a little gravity to the design. \n\n4\u2019s garnish complements the curves and lines of the pastry, but the volume is a little overwhelming to the main dish. Try playing around with different shapes/sizes/thicknesses in regard to your piping. Experiment with making fewer, more effective additions to the plate. Consider how the dish will be eaten. Is the diner meant/likely to eat the dish by cutting the pastry and eating each bite with a little bit of the garnish, or is the garnish meant to be eaten before/after the pastry? Will the garnish be appealing, if eaten separately? \n\nWhile the mint does add a little pop of color, it\u2019s addition really adds little-to-nothing else to the dish. Try to avoid adding a garnish to a plate that was not included inside of the pastry, itself. Throwing mint on top is easy, and it looks ok, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily fit in every dish. Get creative with your ingredients, and try to think about plating in your planning process. I think incorporating a bit of pistachio into the pastry (either in the crust, or you could add a pistachio pastry cream, or other layer, in addition to the curd) would add a little more nuance to the flavor profile of the dish, and lend its color to the plate. The addition doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be pistachio, though. Incorporate whatever flavor you like: strawberry, hibiscus, lemongrass, lime, earl grey tea\u2026You name it; get funky with it. \n\nThe size of the plates are a bit large for the pastry, but they do look SuPEr cool! I love the color contrast and the interesting texture they appear to have. \n\nGood job! It looks like you had fun.

Don't blame me if you gonna bake this. I know this may sound like a LOT when you read the ingredients, but I made this in a 25 by 20CM pan, and I wanted to share it with some friends and family. So cut this in half, or 25% less, but make sure, you get thick layers. It is really important to get thick layers.\n\nMaybe a [video recipe](https://youtu.be/s73CRe-cqxM) if you want it\n\nRecipe :\n\nCookie layer : \n\n \\- 240gr choco chips \n\n \\- 420gr flour\n\n \\- 340gr butter\n\n \\- 3 eggs\n\n \\- 200gr brown sugar\n\n \\- 200gr white sugar\n\nMelt the butter and add it to a bowl. Add the white+brown sugar to it, give it a good mix, until combined nicely. Add some vanilla essence depending on your taste, 4 eggs and mix it again. Make sure the butter is not hot, we don't want to cook the eggs.\n\nAdd the flour, pinch of salt and mix it. Scrape the edges mix, add chocolate chips and mix it again with the hand mixer or spatula. Rest in the fridge for half an hour to 1 hour.\n\nOreos for Oreo layer.\n\nBrownie layer:\n\n \\- 225gr butter\n\n \\- 350gr melted chocolate\n\n \\- 4 eggs\n\n \\- 200gr white sugar\n\n \\- 200gr brown sugar\n\n \\- 90gr flour\n\n \\- 50gr cacao\n\nOn top of 4 eggs, add white and brown sugar give it a mix. Melt the butter, make sure is hot, and add the chocolate in it. Make sure you cut your chocolate as small as you can. After you put the chocolate in the hot butter, cover it with a plate for around 1 minute. Not more than 1 minute. Then take a spatula and mix slowly. It should melt pretty easy and combine nicely.\n\nAlso make sure to have the chocolate around room temp and not cold from the fridge. Now on that mixture of eggs + sugar, add some vanilla and pistachio or almond essence, and the melted chocolate with the butter. Give it a mix, add your flour and cocoa powder and mix it again. \n\nAlign a baking sheet on your baking pan that's already greased with the non stick spray or a little butter. You do this if you want nice edges, it helps the baking sheet to stick better to the pan. Add the cookie mixture first, use a spatula to even it out on the pan, add Oreos on top of it, and then add the brownie mixture.\n\nCook for around 50 minutes at 180 degree Celsius without fan. NO MORE THAN 50 minutes.\n\nYou can't do any test to be sure if this is cooked trough or not. At any time you gonna try to put a toothpick in it to check it is gonna come out with a lot of melted chocolate on it. If the top started to crack that means is cooked. And don't worry, the brownie layer will be fudgy and not cakey or overcooked. At least mine wasn't overcooked.\n\nThe most important thing is to let this rest overnight. I didn't and when I cut into it, I still had melted chocolate. But the next day, it was the most beautiful cake thingy that I made. Is really great if you eat it out of the fridge. Is way better when is cold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI topped mine with some vanilla ice cream with stracciatella, and caramel of course. As this wasn't sweet enough already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you gonna enjoy it! And pleasea ask if you have any questions.", "Wow those look filthy good.", "But why they slutty?", "Give em here \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI WANT IT"]}

Beat butter with sugar and salt at medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes using the paddle attachment. Once the mixture turns pale yellow and almost doubles in size, add yolk and beat for another minute. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the mixer regularly so all the ingredients get fully incorporated\n2. Add all the flour in at once and mix well by hand, with a rubber spatula. Once fully incorporated, add heavy cream and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Cut two large pieces of parchment paper. Place the dough between the papers and smear with the palm of your hand roughly into the shape you want, but small enough to continue rolling out with a rolling pin later.\n4. Wrap the dough, with the paper left on, in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour, but overnight is best.\n5. If your dough has rested in the fridge for 2 hours or less \u2013 take it out 30 minutes before rolling. If overnight \u2013 take it our 1-1.5 hours in advance. Roll out the dough between the paper to a thickness of 5mm into the rough shape of a circle.\n6. Cut a circle 1.5-2 inches larger in diameter than your tart shell. Place between two pieces of parchment once more and place it in the freezer for 15 minutes until becomes firm.\n7. Take the dough out of the freezer and warm it with your hands. It will start to become like playdough. Gently place it in your tart ring, pressing the dough inside. You can have a little cracking and repair work.\n8. Once the dough is evenly distributed inside the mold, return it to the freezer for 15 minutes. Once cold and firm, cut the overhang with a knife, holding it perpendicular to the sides of your tart ring. Prick the bottom with a fork about 20-25 evenly and return to the freezer.\n9. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Once the oven is hot, transfer your tart to the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, rotating halfway. The shell is ready when it turns golden.\n10. Take the shell out and let cool completely before filling.\n \n \nThe Cheesecake.\nyields one 8 inch tart plus some extra\n\n \ningredients\n\u2022 100 ml heavy cream\n\u2022 100 gram cream cheese\n\u2022 50 ml water\n\u2022 3 gram agar agar powder\n\u2022 50 gram powdered sugar\n\u2022 1 teaspoon vanilla\n\u2022 4 tablespoons 1-1 ratio by weight blackberry-sugar sauce (strained)\n \ndirections\n1. Mix together water and agar agar powder in a bowl\n2. Heat in a microwave or on a stove until it is very hot and the agar agar dissolves completely.\n3. In another bowl, take cream and heat it in the microwave or on the stove.\n4. Now mix the very hot agar agar mix and the hot cream. Set aside.\n5. In a larger bowl, cream together room temperature cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and blackberry sauce.\n6. Add the cream and agar agar mix and whisk until all the ingredients are incorporated well.\n7. Pour and smooth into the prebaked tart shell with an offset spatula. Fill to about \u00bd inch below the top of the tart shell, and refrigerate for 3-4 hours.\n\n \nThe Agar Agar\nyields just enough to cover the tart\n\n \ningredients\n\u2022 3 packets crystalized lemon\n\u2022 1 lemon\u2019s zest\n\u2022 3 tablespoons fresh lemon thyme\n\u2022 500 gram boiling water\n\u2022 4 gram agar agar powder\n\u2022 5 tbsp sugar\n \ndirections\n1. Combine crystalized lemon, lemon zest, and fresh thyme in a bowl and pour the 500 grams of boiling water in. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set aside for 2 hours\n2. Strain the prepared water, and combine with the sugar and agar agar powder. Cook for two minutes over low heat, stirring constantly.\n3. Once two minutes has passed, take it off the heat and continue stirring until it nears warm to room temperature and pour into tart shell over the cheesecake filling.\n4. Transfer the tart to the fridge and allow to set for 1 hour.\n\n \nThe Decoration\nyields just enough to decorate the tart\n\n \ningredients\n\u2022 8 large blackberries\n\u2022 Candied lemon slices\n\u2022 1 egg white\n\u2022 2 teaspoons sugar\n\u2022 5 sprigs of lemon thyme\n\u2022 5 sprigs of lemon balm or mint\n \n \ndirections\n1.

Even the chocolate icing is dairy free and vegan friendly!\r  \n\r  \n**If you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here, which includes a few additional tips!** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw) \r  \n\r  \n\r\\-----\r  \n**INGREDIENTS**\r  \n\r  \n**Chocolate Cake**\r  \n180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour\r  \n198g (1 cup) granulated sugar\r  \n6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda)\r  \n3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\r  \n40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder\r  \n80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil)\r  \n15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or other light vinegar such as white vinegar or rice vinegar)\r  \n5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\r  \n236ml (1 cup) water\r  \n\n\n**Chocolate Icing**\r  \n170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar)\r  \n30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder\r  \n45ml (3 tbsp.) water\r  \n5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\r  \n\r  \n\\-----\r  \n\r\r  \n**Method**\r  \n\r  \n1. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F and line an 8\u201d square pan with parchment paper.\r  \n\r  \n2. To a mixing bowl add 180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour, 198g (1 cup) granulated sugar, 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt, 6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda) and 40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder. Whisk this together until thoroughly combined and the mixture is uniform in colour.\r  \n\r  \n3. To 236ml (1 cup) water add 15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or alternative light vinegar) and 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract. Just give that a little stir!\r  \n\r  \n4. Add your water-vinegar liquid to the dry ingredients, along with 80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil). **Mix this quickly**. You want to get this batter into the oven as fast as possible in order to achieve the best rise! A few lumps in the batter is fine, but try to get as much of the flour mixture combined as possible.\r  \n\r  \n5. Pour your deliciously chocolate cake batter into your prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n6. Now onto the vegan chocolate icing! To a mixing bowl add 170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar) and 30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder. Mix these ingredients together and then add 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract.\r  \n\r  \n7. Add in water, one tablespoon at a time. I used 45ml (3 tbsp.) for the perfect consistency. Your icing should be thick enough to remain on your cake, but thin enough to spread easily.\r  \n\r  \n8. Remove your cake from the oven, let it cool to room temperature, spread your chocolate icing over the top and let the icing set. If you want to dress your cake up, feel free to add sprinkles, chocolate shavings or your favourite candy on top!\r  \n\r  \n9.

In a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, salt, and baking soda; set aside.\n2. In a bowl fit with a mixer, beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium-high speed; about 4 minutes.\n3. On medium speed, beat in molasses until combined.  Beat in egg and vanilla extract.  Use a spatula to wipe down the sides of the bowl and beat until combined; about 2 minutes.\n4. With the mixer on low, slowly beat dry ingredients into wet ingredients until combined.  Wipe the sides of the bowl down with a spatula then beat; 1 minute.\n5. Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for at least 1 1/2 hours.\n6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\n7. Using a cookie scoop, scoop dough.  I used a 1 1/2 tablespoon scoop. Cut cookie scoop dough in half then roll each half into a ball.  Each ball is mini; about 3/4 inch or about a little more than 1/2 tablespoon of dough.\n8. Roll dough into 1/3 cup granulated sugar then place on prepared baking sheet.\n9. Place dough 1 inch apart.  Using a teaspoon measuring spoon, carefully indent the cookie in the center and press in just to form the center. Don\u2019t puncture through the dough to the cookie sheet.\n10. Bake cookies about 7-9 minutes.  I baked mine for 8 minutes but oven temperature may vary.  Using a teaspoon measuring spoon, indent the center of the cookie.  Allow cookies to cool before filling.\n\nTo Make the Filling\r  \n\n\nIn a small saucepan over low heat, melt white chocolate chips and skim milk. Stir in ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and molasses.  \r  \nWorking in batches, carefully spoon about 1 teaspoon chocolate mixture into the indent.  I had about 50-60 mini cookies.  Reheat chocolate mixture as needed to spoon easily into indents.  Allow to cool; about 10 minutes.\r  \n\n\nTo Make the Topping\r  \n\n\nIn a small saucepan over low heat, melt white chocolate and skim milk until silky smooth.  Carefully drizzle cookies with chocolate. Allow cookies to cool then store in airtight container.  \r  \n\n\nRecipe: [https://www.swankyrecipes.com/gingerbread-thumbprint-cookies.html](https://www.swankyrecipes.com/gingerbread-thumbprint-cookies.html)"]}

The different colors on the top correspond to identical infusions of Ceylon, Saigon, and Indonesian Cassia cinnamons. The limiting factor in this recipe was the pate sable\u00e9 (makes 8-9 2mm thick 8cm diameter tarts), followed by the creams and frangipane, which made just enough for the tarts. \n\n**RECIPE**\n\n**Triple Cinnamon Pate Sablee**\n\n115g soft butter\n\n200g AP flour\n\n40g powdered sugar\n\n2g salt\n\n20g egg yolk (~1)\n\n~1g Ceylon, Saigon, and Cassia\n\n5g whole milk (if necessary)\n\nCream butter, sugar, salt, and cinnamon for 5 min. Add egg yolk, then the flour. Beat until combined, add milk if the dough won't come together. Chill for 30-60 min, then [shape into tart shells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rwibeVhf8o&ab_channel=FluffyMunckin) and refrigerate. Before filling, prick bottoms with a fork a few times. Once filled with the frangipane (see below), bake at 350F for 20 min, then remove the tart rings and bake for ~5min more, until light golden-brown.\n\n**Triple Cinnamon Almond Praline Paste**\n\n150g slivered almonds\n\n150g sugar\n\n10g molasses\n\n1/4tsp Fleur de Sel\n\n1/2 tsp Ceylon/Saigon/Cassia (My scale isn't precise enough to measure these, so I used volumetric quantities. Anyhow, you'd yell at me if I said \"0.65g each\".)\n\nToast almonds at 325F for 10-12min, or until golden brown and fragrant. Let cool. Make a dry caramel with the sugar, add the almonds, and coat the nuts in caramel. Spread onto a silicone mat, and let cool completely. Grind in a food processor until a smooth paste forms. Add molasses, FDS, and cinnamons, and blend thoroughly.\n\n**Milk Chocolate \"Cinnamon Sticks\"**\n\n~75g milk chocolate\n\n1/2tsp each cinnamon\n\n1tsp Dutched cocoa powder\n\nMix all powders together. Melt milk chocolate, spread thinly onto a marble surface. Allow it to set, and once it no longer sticks to your finger, use a bench scraper to push part of the chocolate, allowing it to curl in on itself. Then push from the opposite direction to form the stick. (Look up instructional vids for making chocolate cigarillos, it's the same general idea, only you're not rolling them so tightly, and you're also rolling them from the opposite end as well.) Dust with the cinnamon/cocoa mix, and let set to fully harden.\n\n**Cinnamon Whipped Ganache** (x3)\n\n50g cream +50g milk\n\n2g powdered gelatin, bloomed in 10g cold water\n\n50g white chocolate\n\n100g cream, cold\n\n5g Cinnamon\n\nFood coloring (brown and black)\n\nBloom gelatin, and chop the white chocolate. Heat up milk and the 50g cream with the cinnamon until the mixture nears boiling. Remove from the heat, and steep for 20min with the lid on. Reheat to near-boiling, pour over white chocolate. Let sit for 30 seconds, then stir to combine. Add the gelatin, blend with an immersion blender. Add the cold cream and food coloring, blend, and chill completely.\n\nRepeat with remaining cinnamons. I coded the colors as lightest = Cassia, darkest = Saigon, and the mid-range being Ceylon. I had to add some powdered black food coloring, because my brown gel-based wasn't darkening the color sufficiently. Just go with whatever works here.\n\nNote: The ganache was a little loose once smoothed out, so I'd either replace the milk with cream, or increase the gelatin by a gram. Would be easier to work with.\n\n**Almond-Cinnamon Frangipane** (Adapted from a Bruno Albouze frangipane recipe)\n\n100g almond flour\n\n80g powdered sugar\n\n10g cornstarch\n\n50g egg\n\n115g butter, softened\n\n2g salt\n\n1tsp Ceylon, Saigon, Cassia\n\nCream dry ingredients with the butter for 5 minutes. Add the egg, and beat until homogeneous.\n\n\n\n**ASSEMBLY + Nappage glaze and Praline Chantilly** *\n\nBeat each cinnamon ganache to smooth it out, then fill a silicone donut mold in three sections, corresponding to each cream. Freeze for several hours until completely frozen.\n\n**Nappage Glaze**\n\n[(I halved the recipe from Chef Iso's nappage glaze.)](https://chefiso.com/p/glaze-fruit-tart-recipe/) Glaze when the temp cools to 130F\n\nRemove \"donuts\" from their molds, and keep cold. Use an apple corer to remove the center of the frangipane cream from each tart (Make sure you don't punch through the bottom!!). Poke a skewer in the bottom of each donut, and quickly dip in the glaze. Flip right side up, and place a donut on each tart. Refrigerate for 10-20 minutes to keep the cream cold and allow the glaze to set.\n\n**Praline Chantilly**\n\n100g heavy cream, chilled\n\n30g almond-cinnamon praline paste\n\nMix the praline with the cream, then beat until firm peaks.\n\nFill the hole in the center of each tart with almond-praline paste. Top with a bit of the chantilly, then garnish with the cinnamon \"sticks\". Refrigerate for a few hours to allow the ganache to thaw.\n\n**Final notes and thoughts**\n\nI got inspired to make these after finding out about the different types of cinnamon, and seeing a few pastries with the same idea, only with different vanilla types. In terms of flavor, this was one of the coolest things I've made yet. You can absolutely taste the difference between each type of cinnamon. The creams, in general, taste like the leftover milk from Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but with each cinnamon showing off its distinctions in each cream. \n\nThere're also a bunch of neat textures at play. Buttery, crumbly sablee, soft frangipane, the creamy top, gritty praline...altogether, I LOVED how all the flavors played off each other as well.\n\nRegarding the cinnamon sticks, don't worry about them tasting overly cinnamon-y. You get a hit of cinnamon, but the milk chocolate overwhelms it soon after. And it set real nicely too, it's got a snappy texture despite intentionally not being tempered.\n\nA few things I could've done better: it's hard to smooth out the bottoms of the donuts with the spike in the middle of the mold, so as a result, the bottoms were a little uneven. That's why there's a bit of a gap in between the donuts and the tarts. I should've taken the time to smooth the bottoms out after unmolding, but oh well. I also wish the praline were smoother. I should've added a bit of oil to the praline; I think the cinnamon acted to absorb a slight bit of the almond oil, making the texture thicker than usual. Or it was the molasses, I dunno.\n\n*Split up, because these are made right before or during assembly. Don't make them ahead of time, it can mess with the components if you store them.", "Wow!!!", "This is incredible work!", "Cute!", "I just came...", "This is absolutely amazing!"]}

Combine crust ingredients, press firmly into the bottom of a 9\" springform pan and bake for 8-9 minutes.\n\nBring a few cups of water to a simmer on the stove, this will be used for the water bath later. \n\nCream together cream cheese and the sugars using a hand mixer on med. low speed. Once combined and fluffy add the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice and combine. Once mixed thoroughly, add the eggs, one at a time and mix just until combined being careful not to overmix at this step. Using a spatula to fold the eggs into the batter is better but takes more time. \n\nOnce your crust is out of the oven and has cooled add your batter to the springform pan. Tap the pan lightly on the counter, this will release any air bubbles in the batter to the surface where they can be popped carefully with a form. \n\nPlace springform pan in a water bath and place the whole bath into the oven for 60 minutes. After 60 minutes, turn the oven off and crack the door slightly. Allow it to cool like this for an additional 30-45 minutes, then move it to a cooling rack on the counter until cool enough to place in the fridge. Chill for at least 12 hrs. \n\nTips:\n\nUsing a plastic turkey bag or slow cooker liner to make a bag, you can seal your springform pan from the water bath after you have baked the crust. Place the pan in the bag and roll the edges down to the top of the pan, roll up the excess material and find a way to secure it to the top rim of the pan, I use a binder clip but there are plenty of ways. This way you will be guaranteed to keep the water from finding a way into your pan and ruining the crust. You can also use aluminum foil but I haven't personally had much luck with that method.\n\nUse a non-serrated knife when cutting the cheesecake, if possible submerge the knife in hot water for a few seconds before making each slice, wiping the water off before cutting, and any bits stuck to the knife after cutting. This will help ensure clean cuts all the way around the cake.", "That looks delicious", "\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI WANT !!!", "And it was as perfect as it looks!?!?!?

Beat the egg yolks with condensed milk and melted unsalted butter.\n2. Add sifted flour with salt and baking powder, mix. Knead a not very thick dough.\n3. Draw an 18-cm circle on the parchment paper. Flip the parchment upside down. Pour half of the batter into the middle of the circle and spread into a thin layer. Bake for about 7 minutes(180C), or until the middle is baked through. Repeat the process for the second cake layer.\n4. Cool the cakes.\n\n***Souffl\u00e9:***\n\n1. Soak the agar-agar in water (150g).\n2. Take condensed milk and butter out of the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature.\n3. Beat the condensed milk with the butter and vanilla extract to a smooth paste, and set aside in the bowl at room temperature.\n4. Begin to beat the egg whites until firm and shiny meringue is obtained.\n5. Bring the agar-agar to a boil over medium heat.\n6. Pour the sugar into the agar-agar and boil until ready. Bring mixture to the temperature of 110C. Check if the syrup is ready using the \u201cthread\u201d method. A thin thread should hang from a spoon dipped in the syrup. Add lemon juice.\n7. Pour hot syrup into the egg whites in a thin stream, beating constantly. The paste will immediately grow several times bigger.\n8. Beat to a thick consistency. Agar-agar will thicken as it cools.\n9. Add the butter and condensed milk mixture, and once again mix on a low speed to smooth paste.The souffl\u00e9 is ready!\n\n***Assemble the cake:***\n\n1. Put the first cake layer into the center of a 20-cm cake ring.\n2. Immediately pour half of the souffl\u00e9 onto the first cake layer. Spread evenly to fill all the gaps.\n3. Place the second cake layer onto the souffl\u00e9.\n4. Pour the entire second half of the souffl\u00e9 into the cake ring and smooth the top with a palette knife.\n5. Put it in the refrigerator to chill.\n\n***Dark Chocolate Glaze:***\n\n1. Melt the chocolate and heavy cream in a double boiler. Stir.\n2. Take the cake from the fridge and remove the cake ring.\n3. Pour the glaze onto the chilled cake. Tilting the cake, distribute the glaze on all surfaces.You can leave a round space in the middle.\n4. Put it in the refrigerator to chill.\n5.

Salted honey pie is a buttery pie crust filled with a super smooth caramel custard, comprising of honey, brown sugar and double cream. The honey pie is then garnished with sea salt to finish! This is the perfect pie for summer, as it's served cold out of the fridge!\r  \n\r  \nIf you're a visual learner, be sure to check out our video recipe here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en0Fk9x-XcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en0Fk9x-XcQ)\n\n\r  \n\r\\-----\r  \n\r  \n**Ingredients**\r  \n\r  \na single pie crust (pre-made, roll out or homemade!)\r  \n4 egg yolks\r  \n600ml (2 1/2 cups) double cream / heavy cream\r  \n144g (1 cup) brown sugar  \n37g (1/3 cup) cornflour\r  \n3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\r  \n120ml (1/2 cup) runny honey\r  \n10ml ( 2 tsp.) vanilla extract\r  \nsea salt to garnish\r  \n\r  \n\\-----\r  \n\r  \n**Method**\r  \n\r  \n1.Preheat oven to 190C | 375F and line an 8\u201d pie dish with your crust. Chill your pie crust in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. You can use a pre-made pie crust from the store, roll out pie pastry, or make your pie pastry from scratch, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous!\r  \n\r  \n2. To a medium bowl, add 4 egg yolks and give them a quick whisk to combine the egg yolks together.\r  \n\r  \n3. To a saucepan, sieve 37g corn flour (also known as corn starch). I like to sieve the corn flour to prevent any lumps in the custard! Now add 144g brown sugar and 3g salt to the corn flour. Break up any lumps of sugar with a wooden spoon or plastic spatula and give the mixture a quick stir.\r  \n\r  \n4. Add 600ml double cream (also known as heavy cream) to the mixture and turn the heat to medium. You\u2019ll want to stir the mixture constantly, so that it doesn\u2019t burn to the bottom of your pan! As the temperature increases, the mixture will thin out. However it\u2019ll then begin to thicken \u2013 and you\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when you see bubbles forming underneath and on the surface.\r  \n\r  \n5. Now we need to carefully temper our egg yolks! Add a small amount of your warm cream mixture to the yolks whilst whisking. Keep adding small amounts and whisk consistently until you\u2019ve added all of the warm cream mixture. If you add the mixture too fast, you\u2019ll cook the egg yolks, which will result in a scrambled egg custard mess!\r  \n\r  \n6. Once combined, add in 10ml (2 tsp.) vanilla extract and 120ml runny honey. Stir to melt the honey into the mixture.\r  \n\r  \n7. Sieve the mixture into your chilled pie crust. This ensures your custard filling is as smooth as smooth can be!! Carefully carry it to your oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n8. When the pie comes out of the oven, the filling will still be really jiggly. Don\u2019t worry; it will set! Let the pie cool to room temperature and then chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours.\r  \n\r  \n9. Remove from the fridge, garnish with sea salt (optional) and serve!  \n\r  \n\r  \nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, feel free to ask me below! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\r  \n\r  \nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "Well I'm making this.\n\nSimilar to a butter tart or pecan pie.", "Can someone describes what this tastes like?", "This is really good with walnuts too!", "This looks/sounds like something they\u2019d serve in cafes in Pixie Hollow and I\u2019m so here for it", "One of my favorite pies!!

Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e should be set around the edges but still slightly wobbly in the center when you take it out. It will continue to set as it cools.\r  \n\r  \nToo much liquid: Make sure you're using the right proportion of cream to egg yolks. Too much cream can result in a softer custard.\r  \n\r  \nOven temperature: Ensure your oven is calibrated correctly and maintaining a consistent temperature. Baking at a slightly higher temperature can also cause the custard to remain jiggly.\r  \n\r  \nCooling: Let the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e cool at room temperature, then refrigerate it for several hours or overnight. This helps it set further.\r  \n\r  \nIf it's still not setting, you can try placing it back in the oven at a low temperature for a short time, checking it frequently to avoid overcooking.\n\nBut if you're interested in making another tasty dessert similar to creme brulee, then why not make peach cobbler. Personally I think both desserts taste pretty similar, they both have the same crunchy and gooey texture, and around the same proportions of sweetness.

I've made them like three times already this week, haha. They're seriously the easiest things ever, taste amazing (like little bites of tropical heaven!), and are actually pretty good for you. Perfect for when you want something sweet but don't want the sugar crash. Plus, NO BAKING!\n\nThought I'd share the love in case anyone else needs a new go-to snack:\n\n**Basically, you just need:**\n\n* **Shredded Coconut:** About 1.5 cups (make sure it's unsweetened!)\n* **Medjool Dates:** About 1 cup, pitted. These are the magic ingredient \u2013 they make it sweet and sticky. (Quick tip: if your dates feel dry, soak 'em in hot water for 10 mins first, then drain 'em well. Makes a HUGE difference.)\n* **Coconut Oil:** 2 tablespoons, melted.\n* **Vanilla Extract:** 1 teaspoon. 'Cause vanilla.\n* **Salt:** Just a tiny pinch! Seriously balances the sweetness.\n\n**How to make 'em (it's stupid simple):**\n\n1. **Blitz the dates:** Chuck the pitted dates in a food processor and pulse 'til they form a sticky paste.\n2. **Mix it all up:** Add the coconut, melted coconut oil, vanilla, and salt right in there with the dates. Pulse it again until it all comes together and looks like a dough you can squish.\n3. **Roll 'em up:** Grab little bits (like a tablespoon size) and roll them between your hands into balls. If it gets too sticky, just wet your hands a tiny bit. (Sometimes I roll 'em in extra coconut after, just for looks!)\n4. **Chill out:** Pop the finished balls on a plate/tray with parchment paper (so they don't stick!) and put 'em in the fridge for about 30 minutes. This helps them firm up perfectly.\n\nTHAT'S LITERALLY IT.\n\nSeriously, they take like 15 mins to whip up (+ chill time). Perfect energy boost, healthy dessert, whatever! They keep great in the fridge in a container for ages (if they last that long!).\n\nAnyway, just had to share because they're *that* good. Give 'em a try if you want something easy and delicious!

Assemble the Dessert:\n\nIn a serving glass or bowl, layer a portion of the cooled apple compote at the bottom.\n\nSprinkle a layer of toasted bread cubes over the apples.\n\nTop with a layer of whipped cream.\n\nRepeat the layers if desired, finishing with a layer of whipped cream on top.\n\n\n\n5. Garnish and Serve:\n\nOptionally, dust a little extra cinnamon on top and add chopped nuts or raisins for added flavor and texture.\n\nServe immediately to ensure that the bread remains crispy.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy this delightful dessert that perfectly marries the warmth of spiced apples with the crunch of toasted bread and the lightness of whipped cream!\n\n\n---", "One of my favorites is the Betty crocker orange cranberry muffins, but I substitute lemon and raspberry instead.

{"title": "Coconut Cream Pie", "selftext": "I had some ingredients in my pantry leftover that I wanted to use up, so I created a custom recipe for a coconut cream pie.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j8wod0", "created_utc": 1741714962.0, "score": 165, "author": "Zakrius", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/dessert/comments/1j8wod0/coconut_cream_pie/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Here\u2019s the recipe:\n\n\n- Fully baked pie shell, allowed to fully cool\n\n- 4 egg yolks\n\n- \u00bc cup of cornstarch\n\n- \u2154 cup of granulated sugar\n\n- Pinch of salt\n\n- 12.2 fl oz (360 ml) can of evaporated coconut milk\n\n- 5.6 fl oz (165 ml) can of coconut milk\n\n- \u00bd cup of whole milk\n\n- \u00bd cup of heavy cream\n\n- 1 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut (I prefer shredded, not shaved)\n\n- 2 tbsp of unsalted butter\n\n- Splash of vanilla essence\n\n- Extra cup or more of heavy whipping cream, 2 tbsp of sugar and a few heavy pinches of unsweetened shredded coconut (optional) for topping\n\n\n\nFully bake your pie shell and allow to cool completely. I made my own pie shell from butter and all purpose flour, but you can use a store bought one if you\u2019re a cheater. Just make sure it\u2019s fully baked before you start making the filling. It\u2019s a no bake filling, but let\u2019s be honest, you still have to cook it. Make sure your pie shell is cooled before you make the filling. You could add the filling to a hot pie shell, but then it will take way longer for it to set later because it\u2019ll take longer for it to cool down.\n\nIn a small mixing bowl, mix egg yolks and cornstarch into a paste. It will look clumpy, dry and gross. In a separate saucepan, combine sugar, evaporated coconut milk, coconut milk, whole milk and heavy cream and bring to a boil. Once all that is boiling, reduce heat to medium-low. Transfer half a cup of the hot mixture into the mixing bowl with the yolks/cornstarch paste while whisking vigorously until that yellow mess becomes smooth. You should be adding that hot milk mix very slowly to avoid cooking the yolks. Add a second half a cup to thin it out so that it can all be poured back into the hot milk mix in the saucepan more easily. Again, pour very slowly while vigorously whisking everything in the saucepan to make sure it all gets mixed evenly without cooking those yolks or you\u2019ll get little yellow lumps of cooked yolk floating around. The mixture will thicken very quickly as you do this. Continue to whisk while cooking on low heat for another two minutes to make sure that cornstarch is cooked through so your filling thickens to the point that it turns into a pudding like consistency. Immediately remove from heat.\n\nIn another large clean mixing bowl, add the cup of shredded coconut, two tbsp of butter,  splash of vanilla. If you hate the texture of coconut like I do, do yourself a favor and get the kind that is finely shredded and looks like loose snow. Don\u2019t use the shaved kind, which is much courser and thicker. That\u2019s what I did, cause this is my recipe and I can do what I want. If you only have shaved coconut, I hope you have a food processor, otherwise\u2026 yuck! You can use shaved coconut if you really want\u2026 but then we can\u2019t be friends\u2026 just kidding.\n\nNow, dump that hot pudding from the saucepan into the mixing bowl with your shredded coconut and fold continuously with a silicone spatula until that butter is fully melted and all ingredients are thoroughly combined. Basically, you\u2019re a hitman, and that\u2019s butter is your target. Now make that guy disappear for good. Once that\u2019s done, pour this mixture into the fully baked pie shell. Cover with a loose sheet of heat safe plastic food wrap to avoid a milk skin from developing as the filling cools. Make sure that plastic is in contact with the surface of the filling. This also flattens out the surface. An air bubble here and there are fine, but not too many. It will peel off cleanly later. Don\u2019t worry. Now you just have to resist the urge to keep patting and tapping the jiggly plastic wrap covered surface of the pie filling with the tips of your fingers like I kept doing. I mean\u2026 you can do it too, cause it\u2019s jiggly and fun, but your fridge door will be open, which means your pie won\u2019t be chilling. And you need to that pie to chill all the way through in the fridge for 3-4 hrs to set. Go binge watch a tv show or something. These no bake fillings need some time to cool down and chill through. Warm filling won\u2019t hold its shape, and it takes time for the center to cool all the way in order to keep its structure when you cut into them.\n\nAfter the pie has set, add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream to a clean mixing bowl. Add 2 tbsp of granulated sugar. You can add a little more if you\u2019re crazy. But This pie isn\u2019t supposed to be overly sweet, so don\u2019t ruin it with some excessively sweet whipped cream nonsense. It\u2019ll throw off the balance. Whisk to dissolve the sugar, then whisk vigorously until you have a stiff whipped cream that clings to the side of the bowl. If it can hold its shape and doesn\u2019t try to flow down towards the center anymore, you\u2019ve whipped it enough. Good job! Scoop the whipped cream onto the center of the pie, spread it out and shape the whipped cream as needed with your spatula. Sprinkle some shredded coconut on top if you want. I don\u2019t care for it, but it looked nice for the photos. You don\u2019t need to do it. Either way, let it chill some more in the fridge until the whipped cream is cold like the rest of the pie. I dunno\u2026 give it like a half hour to an hour to let that cream recover from its beating. After that, your pie is ready to be smashed on someone\u2019s face in a cartoon or 1970\u2019s sitcom\u2026 or you can eat it\u2026 or whatever.\n\nIf done correctly, it should be light in both its sweetness and its coconut flavor. Neither should be too strong or very overpowering.", "Kerry Gold!

THESE LOOK AMAZING!! they need more glaze tho, tip: make sure u dip the bottoms of them as well:)\n\nand to answer ur question, here r some tips:\n\n\\-After frying or baking, let the donuts cool down for just a couple of minutes. If they're too hot, the glaze will melt right off. A slightly warm donut will allow the glaze to adhere better and set faster.\n\n**-**Make your glaze thicker by increasing the powdered sugar or reducing the liquid (milk, water, or juice). A thicker glaze will set more quickly and create a richer color. You can also add a bit of cornstarch if you want a matte finish.\n\n\\-Rather than dunking the whole donut at once, try glazing the donuts in a few thin layers. Let the first layer set before adding another coat, which will help it set faster and give you a thicker finish.\n\n\\-After glazing, place the donuts on a wire rack and refrigerate them for 10-15 minutes. The chill will help the glaze firm up and enhance the color, making it appear thicker and more vibrant.\n\n\\-If you want a more intense color, add gel or powdered food coloring to the glaze. It won\u2019t dilute the consistency, so the glaze will still be thick and set faster"]}

", "selftext": "This is recipe and method I used based on reading a few different ones. \n\nIngredients \n(**I used KitchenAid Mixer, various speeds used as noted) \nMeringue\n6 large egg whites, at room temperature\ngood pinch of salt\n2 cups (450g) caster sugar\n2 tsp vanilla extract\n2 tsp cornflour\n1 tsp white vinegar\n1 tsp boiling water (optional but recommended *)\n\t\t\nTopping\n\t\t\n500ml (whipping) cream\n1/4 cup (30 grams) caster sugar\n2 punnets fresh berries, or a combination of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and pomegranate seeds.\nIcing sugar to dust\n\nMethod \n\n1. Preheat your oven to 110\u00b0C (not fan-bake). Line a baking tray with baking paper.\nIn a large metal, ceramic, or glass bowl (not plastic), beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks (speed 2).\n\n2. Continue beating while gradually adding Caster Sugar, a quarter of a cup at a time. (Speed 6) The mixture will become glossier and thicker with each addition, and then continue mixing (Speed 10) until very thick and glossy; this process should take approximately 10 minutes). Finally, (speed 1) incorporate the vanilla extract, vinegar, and Cornflour - Don\u2019t overmix just until incorporated. (Optional but recommended- carefully pour 1 teaspoon boiling water down side mixing bowl and mix in). \n\n3. Spoon the mixture onto the prepared tray into a mound that is approximately dinner plate sized. (My tip is to draw circle from suitable sized upturned bowl on baking paper). \n\n4. Bake for approximately 1 1/2 hours, until the meringue is dry, crisp, (do not open oven while cooking). \n\n5. !! IMPORTANT!! Turn off the oven and leave the pavlova inside for at least an hour before removing it from the oven. Then, allow it to cool completely on a wire rack before transferring it to an airtight container.\n\n6. To serve, place the pavlova on a serving plate. Swirl the whipped cream on top with a spatula and decorate with sliced or chopped fruit of your choice.\n\nEnjoy! \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/c5y40s1he39e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1735175114.0, "score": 13, "author": "Notypicalblonde", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/dessert/comments/1hmddf3/first_time_making_pavlova_not_decorated_pic/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

{"title": "Help: znoud el sit", "selftext": "I tried znoud el sit for the first time in a restaurant recently and it was so amazingly good I wanted to make it myself.  Searched up some recipes and gave it a try.  The biggest challenge was I live in a country without heavy cream but I found two extremely similar recipes that used regular whipping cream instead so I gave that a try.  My ashta was extremely bland.  The only taste it had was the rose water which was overpowering. (Both my husband and I thought it tasted like old lady perfume) Switching to orange blossom water for the next attempt.  But having only ever tasted the proper item once I'm just not sure what else to change.  Any suggestions are welcome, I'm making another small batch tomorrow.\n\nCurrent recipe:\n1/2 liter milk\n1/2 liter whipping cream\n3/4 cup cornstarch \n1/2 cup sugar\n1 Tablespoon rose water\n\nI want it a little richer.  Should I just switch out half of the milk for that much more whipping cream or is there something else that would be better?  Or is it supposed to be fairly bland and I was just so overall impressed with my first one that I didn't notice the individual flavors enough?  Sadly the restaurant is too far away to go back to just to sample the pastry again.\n\nAnd anyone that sees this and is inspired to try something new, definitely do it.  It was surprisingly simple to do despite the super long directions for how to do it.  I was very nervous to give it a go but determined because this was literally the best dessert I've ever in my life eaten.  Each step, once finished, had me saying 'well that part was easy/turned out right'.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dessert/comments/1gutgqa/help_znoud_el_sit/", "created_utc": 1732009100.0, "score": 1, "author": "Eve-3", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/dessert/comments/1gutgqa/help_znoud_el_sit/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}
