Further, the drain fields in older systems (ours is old) can get clogged and then lead to drain field failure.

{"title": "Is it mold? Is it normal? What's growing in your kombucha? Start here!", "selftext": "Welcome to r/Kombucha! If you're wondering what's growing on your kombucha and if it's normal, you've come to the right place.\n\nPlease review this information before posting a picture of your batch to the subreddit.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Dry + fuzzy on the surface of the liquid/pellicle/SCOBY is most likely mold: mold pics [https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi](https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi)\n* Geometric growths or wrinkly patterns on the surface of the liquid/pellicle/SCOBY could be kahm yeast: kahm pics [https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox](https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox)\n* Anything else and anything under the liquid level is most likely normal: normal pics [https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv](https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv)\n* If you're not sure, wait a few more days: mold or kahm will get more obvious as they grow, normal will stay about the same or form into new pellicle/SCOBY\n* If the kombucha is already bottled for carbonation (commonly called second ferment or 2F), mold/kahm is very unlikely due to the high acidity and lack of oxygen access.\n* Always use at least 2 cups of starter per gallon (125ml/L) when making kombucha to acidify the batch: high acidity (pH < 4.6) protects the kombucha from mold and kahm. \n* Read our getting started guide for brewing tips: [https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how\\_to\\_start](https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how_to_start)\n\n**Terminology**: in this guide, \"pellicle/SCOBY\" refers to the rubbery blob that forms at the surface of a batch of kombucha. SCOBY stands for \"symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast\", and those bacteria + yeast are found both in the liquid kombucha and in the solid rubbery blob. The rubbery blob's more accurate scientific name is \"pellicle\": it's a biofilm/mat of bacterial cellulose secreted by and connected to the bacteria forming it (some yeast also live in the pellicle). Culturally, however, the term \"SCOBY\" widely refers to the pellicle so this guide uses both terms.\n\nRead more about pellicles here:\n\n* [https://fermentaholics.com/whats-that-white-waxy-layer-growing-on-my-kombucha-brew/](https://fermentaholics.com/whats-that-white-waxy-layer-growing-on-my-kombucha-brew/)\n* [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12073](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12073) (scroll to \"Tea fungus (fungal biomass) and its applications\" section)\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002013001846](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002013001846)\n\n**Diagnostic Quiz**\n\n1 ) Is the growth/odd thing on the top surface (exposed to air) of the liquid kombucha or existing pellicle/SCOBY?\n\n* Yes - go to 2\n* No - go to 8\n\n2 ) Is the kombucha already bottled for carbonation (commonly called second ferment or 2F)?\n\n* Yes - likely pellicle/SCOBY growth (it can happen in 2F!) or a yeast cluster. Mold/kahm are extremely rare in 2F due to the high acidity (pH <4.2) and lack of oxygen access (required for mold to grow). Booch on!\n* No - go to 3\n\n3 ) Is the growth dry and fuzzy looking with white or green color, and/or with black spores growing out of it?\n\n* Yes - likely mold. Go to Mold section for pictures.\n* No - go to 4\n\n4 ) Is the growth a wrinkly or geometric pattern, very rough patterned surface, or very large air-y bubbles that cover large areas of the surface?\n\n* Yes - likely kahm yeast. Go to Kahm section for pictures.\n* No - go to 5\n\n5 ) Is the growth one of: white/translucent + wet, disconnected oily/patchy sections, or a thin film with bubbles trapped underneath?\n\n* Yes - likely normal pellicle/SCOBY growth. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 6\n\n6 ) Is the growth flat, leathery, and brown?\n\n* Yes - likely a dried out pellicle/SCOBY area. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 7\n\n7 ) Is the the growth brown/black, wet, and partially/completely surrounded by pellicle/SCOBY?\n\n* Yes - likely a yeast cluster. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - probably normal, but review all Normal, Kahm, and Mold pictures to be safe.\n\n8 ) Is the growth/odd thing completely submerged in liquid?\n\n* Yes - likely yeast. Yeast can form dark brown clumps in the liquid or on the pellicle/SCOBY, or alien-like formations suspended in the liquid. Mold and kahm cannot grow beneath the surface of the liquid without also showing on the surface exposed to air. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 2\n\n**Normal**\n\nGallery of normal kombucha: [https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv](https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv)\n\nPellicles/SCOBYs have a **ton** of natural variation. A normal pellicle/SCOBY should look wet, tan/white/translucent, and be mostly smooth (some bumps are normal). There may also be wet brown/black yeast blobs that attach to the liquid side of the pellicle/SCOBY, get absorbed into the pellicle/SCOBY, or float around inside the liquid.\n\n**Mold**\n\nGallery of mold: [https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi](https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi)\n\nMold occurs when the kombucha is not acidic enough (pH < 4.6) to prevent mold organisms from growing. Other factors that make mold more likely are unsanitary conditions and cold brewing temperatures (<65F/18C).\n\nIf there is mold on your batch:\n\n* You **must throw away everything** (liquid + pellicle/SCOBY) and start from scratch with fresh starter tea. By the time mold is visible on the surface of the brew, it has already contaminated the entire batch.\n* Sanitize the vessel, cloth cover, and any utensils used in brewing with a homebrew sanitizing solution (StarSan, OneStep, SaniClean, potassium metabisulfite, etc) or throughly wash with soap + hot water followed by a pasteurized distilled vinegar rinse (no raw vinegar, which contains live microbe cultures).\n\nTo prevent mold, **the most important thing is to use at least 2 cups of starter tea per 1 gallon of kombucha (125ml per L)** to acidify the batch. Starter tea is mature kombucha: either from a previous batch (yours or a friend's), from a SCOBY hotel, or from raw/unflavored/unpasteurized commercial kombucha such as GTs or Health-Ade. \n\nThis amount of starter tea is a good rule of thumb for safe acidity: if you have a pH meter or strips, check that the starting pH is <4.6. Another important factor is maintaining clean/sanitary brewing practices: however, because kombucha is an open air ferment some mold organisms may get in even with a cloth cover, which is why acidity is also important.\n\n**Kahm Yeast**\n\nGallery of kahm: [https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox](https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox)\n\n\u201cKahm\u201d is a generic term for many species of usually non-harmful but also non-desirable wild yeast that can take hold in kombucha (outcompete the kombucha culture) and appear as surface growths on the the pellicle/SCOBY. Kahm often looks geometric or wrinkly vs the smooth/bumpy normal pellicle/SCOBY.\n\nSee this excellent writeup about the science of kahm yeast from u/daileta in r/fermentation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/ytg2vy/kahm_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/ytg2vy/kahm_down/) Their post is focused on lacto fermented vegetables (not kombucha) but is worth a read. \n\nKahm itself isn\u2019t usually dangerous, but to quote our resident food microbiologist u/Albino_Echidna:  \u201cKahm is a term used to lump a whole bunch of unwanted yeasts together, all of which are indicative of an unsafe fermentation environment. Kahm growth is indicative of a fermentation gone wrong. 'Kahm' itself isn\u2019t harmful, but it is a warning sign that your environment wasn\u2019t quite right and will be at higher risk of pathogenic growth as a result.\"\n\nIf your batch has kahm, it is up to you whether to toss + sanitize + start over with fresh starter kombucha or to try to scrape off the kahm from the surface and continue brewing. **It is always safest to toss and restart** \\- see the instructions in the Mold section.\n\nTo help prevent kahm, use at least 2 cups of starter tea per 1 gallon of kombucha (125ml per L) to strongly establish the kombucha culture and acidify the batch. Kahm may also be related to unsanitary conditions, high brewing temperature (>85F/30C), or oversteeping tea (>1hr, but may vary).\n\n**Further reading:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/whats\\_wrong**](https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/whats_wrong)\n\n**If you still aren\u2019t sure after comparing your batch to the pictures here, please make a post and ask!**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/pqu7oq/is_it_mold_is_it_normal_whats_growing_in_your/", "created_utc": 1631998127.0, "score": 475, "author": "mehmagix", "num_comments": 122, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/pqu7oq/is_it_mold_is_it_normal_whats_growing_in_your/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Reddit Master Kombucha Recipe", "selftext": "**Master Kombucha Recipe** - Standard Batch Method\n\nThis recipe is for a 1 gallon or 4 liter batch of kombucha. Use the same proportions for larger batches.\n\nProportions | \u2018Merican | Metric\n--------|-------|-------\nBrew Jar Volume | 1 Gallon | 4 Liters\nTea | 2-3 Tbsp loose, or 7-10 bags| 15-20 Grams\nWater | 12 Cups | 3 Liters\nSugar | 1 Cup | 225 Grams\nSCOBY Starter | 2 Cups | .5 Liter\nSCOBY Pellicle | 1 | 1\n\n**Ingredients:** Try to use high quality ingredients (filtered water, organic sugar and tea), but it's not necessary. The tea is generally a mix of green and black tea, or can be all green or all black. Different teas will differ by weight/volume, so use your own preferences as to how much.\n\n\n**SCOBY = Pellicle + Starter:** Ideally, both pellicle and starter should be used. The starter liquid contains the main culture and should be fully-brewed, plain, unpasteurized Kombucha from a previous batch, from a friend, or from a commercial bottled product. The pellicle is the layer of cellulose that forms on top of the brew to create a protective barrier and control gas exchange. As the pellicle grows with each batch, remove older layers to keep it about one inch thick or less. \n\nIf you do not have a SCOBY pellicle to start with, it's OK to use only the starter liquid and grow a new pellicle. The pellicle does contain some culture, so if you have only a pellicle and no starter liquid, you can substitute with about half the volume of distilled white vinegar or pasteurized apple cider vinegar in order to lower the pH and allow the culture to thrive, which may take a few extra days.  \n\n\n**Containers:** One large glass brewing jar and several glass bottles. Bottles should be sealable air-tight and able to hold pressure, such as swing-tops bottles or re-capped beer bottles. Mason jars, recycled GT bottles, or wine bottles not recommended.\n\n\n**Brewing and Fermenting:**  \n1. Bring half of the water to boil, turn off heat, add the tea and let steep according to type of tea and your preference.\n2. Remove bags or strain out tea leaves, and then add sugar, stirring to dissolve.  \n3. Add the remaining water, should be as cold as possible. Let this sweet tea sit as needed to cool to room temperature.  \n4. Pour the SCOBY starter into the jar, then add the sweet tea, leaving room to then gently float the SCOBY pellicle on top of the tea. It's OK if it sinks.  \n5. Cover with a fine mesh cotton cloth secured with a rubber band. Let sit 7-14 days at warm room temperature, in a cupboard or out of direct sunlight for the first fermentation.  The length of first fermentation is highly dependent on ambient temperature.\n6. Begin tasting the brew with a straw at about 6 days. It's ready when it tastes good to you. Should be sour and not too sweet.  Be patient.\n\n\n**Bottling and Flavoring:**  \n1. Pour using a funnel into clean glass bottles for the second fermentation.  \n2. Reserve 2 cups for the starter for your next batch.\n3. *Optional:* If you want to boost carbonation, add a small amount of sugar to the bottle, approx 1 tsp per 16oz bottle.  \n4. You can also add juice, chopped or blended fruit, ginger, herbs, spices, etc. to the second ferment to both add flavors and boost carbonation. To prevent over-carbonation, *do not add both sugar and juice/fruit.*  \n5. Seal the bottles air-tight and let sit at least 2 days in warm temp, and up to 7 days in cool temp.\n6. Put in the fridge to chill and it's ready to drink.  \n\n*This recipe is based on input gathered from r/Kombucha [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/59rw0l/can_we_make_a_reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5a35gw/draft_2_reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/).*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/", "created_utc": 1478239097.0, "score": 300, "author": "Balsamicon", "num_comments": 124, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Can we stop confusing the pellicle and SCOBY?", "selftext": "Similar to another recent thread [\"Can we stop bragging about overcarbed 2F?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gttsqj/can_we_stop_bragging_about_overcarbed_2f/), I feel its also time to make a post to clarify that your SCOBY and your pellicle **are not the same thing**.\n\nI know. You watched a bunch of videos where some guy points at mushy pancake looking thing, calls it a SCOBY, and you go on watching, no reason to ever question the teacher. You are the student after all. But some times a lesson we need to learn in life is that teachers aren't always right. Some times they were taught wrong by a teacher, who was also taught wrong, and now, they're gonna teach you just the same. The cycle never breaks. And we stay intellectually stuck. You come to this sub, and since half the people think like you do you encounter the same mistake never realizing its a mistake. Heck, even the wiki probably has it wrong.\n\nWhen I first started out, I too was duped into thinking I needed to buy a [12$ \"SCOBY\"](https://www.amazon.com/Fermentaholics-Kombucha-Twelve-Starter-Culture/dp/B01N7S1CV5/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?cv_ct_cx=kombucha+starter&dchild=1&keywords=kombucha+starter&pd_rd_i=B01N7S1CV5&pd_rd_r=6fdea165-30b5-479d-b57f-6731d9f02bca&pd_rd_w=UrskJ&pd_rd_wg=zPnx1&pf_rd_p=1da5beeb-8f71-435c-b5c5-3279a6171294&pf_rd_r=BX94XY5YQFDF8CD79HN7&psc=1&qid=1591205965&sr=1-1-70f7c15d-07d8-466a-b325-4be35d7258cc). In fact, I bought 3, one for my very first 1 gallon jar. Then I was dumb enough to buy 2 more when I wanted to upgrade to 5 gallons because I thought my \"SCOBY wasn't big enough\". I'm willing to admit I was naive and dumb until I finally thought about it for a minute. And its time this sub come around and admit it too so we can start growing our breadth of knowledge like other more mature brewing communities. (FYI, kombucha isnt the only type of beverage that uses a SCOBY)\n\nThe SCOBY is the liquid. SCOBY stands for Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast. The pellicle is a waste product of the bacteria, mostly cellulose. Please notice, cellulose isn't in the acronym S.C.O.B.Y. Its effectively bacteria poop. Its important insofar as it means your bacteria is healthy. Otherwise it is not necessary and can be thrown away. Just like carbonation is important to gauge the health of your yeast. CO2 is the waste product of yeast. No one goes around thinking we need CO2 to start our cultures. So why do we think we so need a pellicle?\n\nSo what is a SCOBY? Its your liquid. You can refer to this liquid as \"starter liquid\" at the time of starting a new batch. Or you can refer to as \"kombucha\" at literally any time. They are the same thing. A mother culture is simply the culture you used to inoculate a new colony. Sometimes brewers designate a strong batch, as in a very healthy and acidic colony as the starter for all new brews. But dont confuse this with a \"SCOBY hotel\". You dont need a bunch of pellicles. You do however need to know that your colony is healthy, and if it is, it should be producing a pellicle. *But you dont need the pellicle*.\n\nHere's why the distinction matters. Once we know the liquid is actually the SCOBY and the pellicle is bacteria poop these questions become nonsensical:\n\n* [How do I transport my SCOBY?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gvtqc0/transporting_scoby/) Answer: have you ever seen kombucha in a bottle?\n* [I need to create a hotel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gv7ve5/scoby_hotel/) Why? If the pellicle is poop then why do you want a jar of poop?\n* [Are my SCOBYS too far gone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/guihei/are_my_scobys_too_far_gone/) Yes. You left a bunch of poop in a jar and the poop did what poop does: attract bugs and other infestations.\n* [Why is my SCOBY misshapen?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gui14u/started_making_a_scoby_about_3_weeks_ago_and_is/) It doesnt matter. Liquid has no shape.\n* [What do you do with your SCOBY while cleaning your vessel?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/grov0n/what_do_you_do_with_your_scoby_while_cleaning/) Again, bottles hold liquids.\n* [My SCOBY wont stay down](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/grbl51/1f_scoby_wont_stay_down/) It doesnt matter where the pellicle is at since you dont need it.\n\nI have also seen questions like:\n\n* Can I fold my SCOBY?\n* Can I cut my SCOBY with a knife to share with friends?\n* Is my SCOBY big enough to use for X gallons? (this was the very first question I posted to this sub)\n\nI apologize if your post has made my list here, I am not trying to single you out and make fun of you, its just these questions dont make any sense.\n\nUltimately, what I'm really trying to say is please dont go buying pellicles from someone because you think you need one. Not to single out fermentaholics, but they give you just a cup of liquid for 12$. That's about half your standard 16 oz bottle. You can get a raw unflavored bottle for [maybe 3$](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GT-s-Synergy-Organic-Kombucha-Watermelon-Wonder-16-fl-oz/438028947). Do the math. That means fermentaholics is selling you a cup of liquid + some dead bacteria poop you dont actually need for 8x the price! **That is a 700% markup!** Just because people dont know any better. Just find a bottle of raw unflavored kombucha. Technically you can use flavored kombucha too, it'll just take a few batches to ferment out the flavor to become \"plain\". It just needs to say raw/live. \n\nThank you for reading my ted talk / rant.

Losing third party apps because of Reddit's API changes.", "selftext": "This subreddit will be joining in on the June 12th-14th protest of Reddit's API changes that will essentially kill all 3rd party Reddit apps. Read more below!\n\nr/Kombucha is in the top 1% largest reddit communities. We have a voice (and lots of pellicles) and the mod team has decided that we will use that voice. \n\nI am r/Kombucha's most active mod and I exclusively moderate + contribute to this sub using Apollo, an iOS third party app. Apollo's moderation features are far better than the official reddit app's - losing Apollo would add a ton of friction to what is currently a pretty easy job (keep being awesome, r/Kombucha). \n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n## What's going on?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\n## What's the plan?\n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\n**The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.**\n\n## What can you do as a user?\n\n* Complain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/)\n\n* Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join the coordinated mod effort at /r/ModCoord.\n\n* Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n* Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.\n\n## What can you do as a moderator?\n\n* Join the coordinated effort over at /r/ModCoord\n\n* Make a sticky post showing your support, [A template has been created here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProCSS/wiki/api_protest_template) you can use or modify to your liking, and be sure to crosspost it to /r/ModCoord.\n\n**Thank you for your patience in the matter,**\n\n**-Mod Team**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/142ilor/whats_worse_than_mold_losing_third_party_apps/", "created_utc": 1686063287.0, "score": 267, "author": "mehmagix", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/142ilor/whats_worse_than_mold_losing_third_party_apps/", "html_title": ""}

This rag-tag operation is what became known as Rise Kombucha (https://risekombucha.com/).\n\nIn 2014, I left Rise Kombucha to start my company, Mannanova (https://www.mannanova.com/), where I brew kombucha while educating, consulting, and training the next generation of brewers. I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of clients all over the world, helping them develop kombucha brewing methods that work best and spreading fermentation culture everywhere.\n\nIn order to keep practicing, and innovating, we also run a boutique kombucha production in the heart of Montreal, Canada, producing 700L every week using seasonal ingredients. We also make batches of other fermented products like hundreds of kilos of kimchi. We\u2019re constantly innovating to make products like sak\u00e9 and penis-shaped kombucha scobys. And, last year, in order to help more people, and to reduce our carbon footprint, we put our commercial kombucha course online: it\u2019s called the Kombucha Masterclass https://kombuchamasterclass.com/\n\nI also somehow became the coauthor of Fermentation Revolution, a cooking book with 70 easy recipes for sauerkraut, kombucha, kimchi and more. That also technically makes me a cofounder of https://fermentationrevolution.com/\n\nMy Proof: https://imgur.com/a/lBnU78E", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/ft2ifm/ive_been_brewing_kombucha_for_10_years_at_every/", "created_utc": 1585756935.0, "score": 224, "author": "Thatkombuchaguy", "num_comments": 191, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/ft2ifm/ive_been_brewing_kombucha_for_10_years_at_every/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "FAQ and master recipe - check here first!", "selftext": "#RECIPE\n\nIngredient | US (Imperial system) | EU (Metric system)\n-- | --: | --:\nWater | 1 qt or 4 cups | 1 L\nSugar | 1/4 cup | 70 g\nBlack tea | 3 bags or 1 tbsp | 7 g\nScoby starter liquid | 1/2 cup | 0.1 L\n*note: scale amounts up or down as you wish*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Brew the sweet tea. Let it cool until it reaches room temperature. Alternatively, brew a smaller batch of hot sweet tea, and add cold water to bring it to room temperature.\n\n2. Combine sweet tea with starter culture (this can just be kombucha from the previous batch) in your brewing vessel. You can include a pellicle, or pieces of it, if you choose - but it is not a requirement. If this is your very first brew, it is beneficial to double the amount of starter liquid. This will bring down the PH-level from the start, and help keep away mold.\n\n3. Cover the vessel with a fine breathable cloth (or coffee filters) that will let air pass through but not bugs or dust. Cheesecloth is not suitable; the holes are too big! Use a rubber band to secure the cloth tightly.\n\n4. Leave it to sit in a warm corner of the house (no direct sunlight, indirect is fine). Minimum recommended temperature is 65F or 18C, with optimum around 80F/27C.  After about a week, you can begin tasting it. Does it taste too sweet? Leave it alone for a while longer. Does it taste perfect? Bottling time! Brew time depends ENTIRELY on preference.\n\n5. For bottling (\"2F\"), add either fruit juice, fruit, or sugar (*don't use square bottles*). This will help create carbonation/fizz. If fruit juice, add 10-20%. Sugar, try to start out with a tea spoon per bottle (1L/4 cups), and adjust based on experimentation. If fruit - again, experiment, or check what other people have done by scrolling through the posts. If you need flavour inspiration, [check this chart](https://i.redd.it/0d72isivpts21.png).\n\n6. The bottles should sit at room temperature for anywhere between 1 and 7 days, to create enough fizz. It depends on amount of sugar, the strength of your kombucha etc. Check them daily to see if they \"pop\", this ensures you don't get bottle explosions as well. You don't have to check all the bottles each day - check one of them, and the next day choose a different one, and so forth. Once ready, they go in the fridge.\n\n\nNote: There is a process description with pictures here: https://imgur.com/a/TwS0UMU .\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n#FAQ\n\n\n###I don't understand all these strange words\n* Pellicle: cellulose layer that forms on top of kombucha (also sometimes referred to as \"scoby\")\n* Scoby: symbiotic culture of yeast and bacteria - the liquid that makes kombucha work\n* Starter liquid: when kombucha has finished fermenting, can be used to start a new culture\n* 1F: first fermentation, mixing sweet tea and starter liquid\n* 2F: second fermentation, where you block the air supply, and you begin to generate fizz\n* 3F: optional third fermentation, people use this if they strain out fruit from their 2F\n* CB: continuous brewing, a method where you keep refilling the same vessel with new tea\n\n&nbsp;\n###My scoby pellicle sunk\nYes, a new one will form at the surface in short order. If you are using an existing SCOBY to start a new batch, don\u2019t expect the pellicle to keep floating at the top \u2013 it is normal for it to fall down!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Is this mold\nProbably not. The pellicle can look very nasty, which is often mistaken for mold. Mold will *always* be on the surface, in contact with air. It will be black, blue, white or brown, and it will be fuzzy. If you are unsure, wait a couple of days, and see if the spots grow bigger and/or more hairy. There are some great mold/not mold pictures to be found [here](https://www.kombuchakamp.com/kombucha-mold-information-and-pictures).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###There\u2019s a bunch of gross looking brown strands or clumps in my kombucha\nYou are looking at long strands or batches of yeast, this is perfectly normal! Just really nasty looking. \n\n&nbsp;\n###Do I need to have a pellicle to start brewing kombucha?\nWhat you need is a starter culture, which can include the pellicle. But it is not strictly necessary. In most cases you can start your own culture from store bought kombucha, as long as it's unpasteurized, and preferably raw - no added fruit, as those can cause mold in your first brew. The \"you need a mother to start\" was a myth for a very long time, so you will still see many sites and books claim it to be the case.\n\n&nbsp;\n###Do I need to use filtered, reverse osmosis, or distilled water for my brew?\nIt's normally not required, but in some cases it could be a good idea. Some municipalities include high amounts of chlorine in the water, which is removed by reverse osmosis and activated carbon filters (like Brita filters). Chlorine is added to water to kill microorganisms, and you\u2019re trying to grow them, so it\u2019s not a good match. Water can often just taste bad for other reasons, so just as you might use filtered water for tea or coffee, use it for your kombucha too!\n\n&nbsp;\n###I have little scoby pellicles growing in my bottles. Is this normal?\nYep! Some fermentation will continue in the bottle, even if it\u2019s refrigerated, just at a slower rate. \n\n&nbsp;\n###I\u2019m not getting any fizz in second fermentation! Help!\nFizz is a very fickle thing, and often it will grow stronger as you go through more brew cycles, cultivating your yeast population. Check to see if your bottles are good enough, they need to seal tight. Try to leave less headspace in the bottle. Try to add more sugar, or add fruit for your 2F. Pineapple/ginger is considered the most fizzy combo. Try to let the second fermentation continue longer.\n\n&nbsp;\n###Which bottles should I use?\nThe best thing is to buy bottles specifically designed for fermented beverages (pressure rated). However if those are not available to you, many people have had success with Grolsch beer bottles, as well as the ALDI lemonade bottles with swing top lids. **Avoid** square bottles at any cost, they are more likely to explode, as the pressure is exerted at the four corners, instead of uniformly distributed around the whole bottle.\n\n&nbsp;\n###Can I make it more alcoholic?\nYes you can make booch with for instance cider yeast, champagne yeast, beer or wine yeast - which will take you to upwards of 20% abv. For that you need to buy the yeast (try eBay) and an airlock.

{"title": "Why you shouldn\u2019t add sugar directly to boiling tea when brewing Kombucha", "selftext": "If you\u2019re brewing kombucha, you know that tea and sugar are the foundation of the fermentation process. BUT there\u2019s a common mistake that can subtly affect your brew - adding sugar directly to boiling tea. It might seem harmless, after all, sugar dissolves easily in hot liquid. But the temperature matters more than you think.\n\nTable sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide, meaning it\u2019s made of two simpler sugars: glucose and fructose. During kombucha fermentation, the SCOBY naturally breaks sucrose down into these components, which the microbes then consume.\n\nHowever, if you add sugar directly to boiling tea, a premature breakdown can happen. That is, high heat speeds up the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose before the fermentation even begins. While the SCOBY can still use these sugars, faster breakdown of sucrose can lead to quicker acid production, potentially making the kombucha too sour too soon.\n\nWith that being said, the microbes in your SCOBY have evolved to break down sucrose gradually. When that process is altered, it may impact fermentation speed, acidity, and flavor complexity.\n\nInstead of dumping sugar into boiling tea, wait until the temperature drops to around 70\u201380\u00b0C (160\u2013175\u00b0F). This is still hot enough to dissolve the sugar completely but not so hot that it alters its chemical structure. After dissolving, let the mixture cool to room temperature before adding the SCOBY, as high temperatures can kill the beneficial bacteria and yeast.

{"title": "Everything I know about making hard kombucha (long)", "selftext": "I have seen many posts about hard kombucha -- how to make it, how to measure the ABV, etc. I've spent several months collecting information and performing experiments. I hope that I can answer some questions and put to rest some misconceptions.  \nIf you have some questions after reading this or if part of the post isn't clear, please let me know.  \nDisclaimer: Hard kombucha is just a hobby, I'm not a professional brewer in any way.  \n\n## Let's talk about the alcohol already in your kombucha\n\nThere are a lot of questions about how much alcohol is in normal (non-hard) kombucha. Obviously it depends on a lot of things, so I'll be pretty general, and mostly I'm just talking about homemade kombucha.  \n\n1. Popular numbers are 0.5 - 3% ABV.\n    1. https://kombuchabrewers.org/resources/approved-alcohol-testing-methods/\n1. Here is a research paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01188.x\n    1. ABV rises from 0.1% (whatever comes from starter) at day 0 to 0.55% at day 14\n    1. ABV stays roughly constant at 0.55% from day 14 to day 20.\n    1. ABV falls from 0.55% to 0.15% from day 20 - 60.\n1. 3% ABV would be all your sugar turned to alcohol (for the basic recipe)\n    1. This would be nearly impossible in normal homemade kombucha\n    1. The few times I've seen normal kombucha tested it falls between 0.5 - 0.7%\n\n\n## Recipes for Hard Kombucha\nHere's one from Boochcraft: https://boochcraft.com/diy-high-alcohol-kombucha/\nAlso, here's a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iltwiy-SZug  \n\nI have a different approach. I start my hard kombucha from a mixture of finished 1F kombucha and filtered water. Essentially, it's like starting a batch of kombucha with more starter, more sugar, and a special yeast.  \n\nMy recipe (should produce 5-6% ABV):  \n1. Steep 4 black teabags in 4 cups of boiling water for 5 minutes. Remove teabags.\n1. Add 2 cups (400 g) of granulated sugar to the black tea. Stir until dissolved\n1. Cool sugar/tea mixture to 75-85F (24-30C).\n1. Pour tea mixture into gallon jar.\n1. Add 6-7 cups of finished 1F kombucha. Adjust to get desired tartness.\n1. Top off the rest of the gallon with filtered water.\n1. Add 3/4 tspn of yeast (I recommend SafAle S-04). I never rehydrate the yeast.\n1. Stir up the yeast/kombucha a bunch.\n1. Put a lid on container (it should be loose enough that gas can escape it). Use an airlock if you have one.\n1. One day later, open the container and give it a few good stirs. Close it back up again.\n1. Start tasting the kombucha at about day 4, fermentation could take up to 20 days.\n\nWhat to expect:  \n+ A ring of fine bubbles around the top of the fermenting kombucha within two days.\n+ A different fermentation smell (not vinegary, more like fermenting wine).\n+ I usually don't get a pellicle to form. Sometimes you might though. I never use bottles with narrow openings.\n+ ...\n\n### When should you stop the fermentation\n\nThis is up to personal preference. For me, I stop when 70-75% of the sugar that I've added is consumed. I've let a few batches go to 95% of the sugar consumed and it tasted very dry. I didn't enjoy that. So, by trial and error, I discovered that 70-75% is what I enjoy drinking. It usually takes eight or nine days to ferment to that level.  \nIf you ferment too much, you can always add more normal kombucha to dilute it back to something you enjoy. I rarely do a 3F with my hard kombucha (adding flavour from fruit). Instead I will drink the hard kombucha straight, or add a little flavoured kombucha that I have sitting around.  \nFlavour-wise: There might be a strong alcohol taste. Often times this is confused to be a high ABV. The other possibility is fusel alcohols. These are alcohols other than ethanol (e.g. methanol). They can give the kombucha that strong alcohol bite. The good news is that yeast will naturally break those alcohols down eventually into ethanol. If you get these flavours consistently and don't like it. I would either try fermenting longer or switching yeasts.  \n\n## Some helpful hints\n\nIf:  \n+ it seems like it doesn't ferment well\n+ after 14+ days the kombucha still tastes sweet\n+ you don't notice a \"different\" fermentation smell (if you know what wine/beer fermentation smells like, it should be like that)\n\nHere are some things that helped me.  \n\n+ Use more yeast. There aren't too many downsides to using more yeast. It'll speed up the fermentation, and impart a little more yeast flavour (which I don't think is very noticeable).\n+ Keep it warm. Make sure the temperature is over 70F (21C).\n+ Use less kombucha. I noticed that the higher the concentration of kombucha the lower the rate of fermentation. When I used a full container of kombucha (just adding yeast and sugar) fermentation slows to a crawl. I think 25% kombucha is about as low as I'd go though. Otherwise you're just fermenting sugar water which I tried and it was disgusting.  \n+ Use less sugar. At first I was shooting for higher ABVs (10 - 12%) and it wasn't working at all for me. Partially that was because I was still learning the ropes. But also, some yeasts do not like high sugar concentrations. For your first couple batches, aim for 4 - 6% ABV.  \n\n## What yeast to use\nHere are some that I've tried:\n+ Red Star Premier Blanc\n+ Lalvin EC-1118\n+ Lalvin K1-V1116\n+ Lalvin 71B\n+ SafAle S-04\n+ SafCider\n\nI recommend: Lalvin EC-1118, K1-V1116, and SafAle S-04. EC-1118 is very quick and seems robust to different conditions. S-04 is a little slower and I think the taste is a little more mellow. K1-V1116 has been working really well the last few batches, my recent favourite.  \n\nI don't recommend: Lalvin 71B, SafCider. Even though people have had luck with the Red Star Premier Blanc, I haven't. So, I don't use it much.  \n\n\n## Potential ABV of your kombucha\n\nIf you want to alter the recipes that you've seen for hard kombucha to get a specific ABV, here are some ways to calculate the potential ABV from an amount of sugar. Many equations exist, these are the ones I like.  \n\nThe easiest equation to use is:  \n```\nABV% = grams_sugar_per_litre / 16.83  \n```\n_Here is an example using my recipe from earlier in the post:  \n2 cups of sugar = 400 g  \n1 gallon = 3.8 L  \nABV% = (400/3.8) / 16.83 = 6.25%_\nThis equation assumes a very high percentage (95%+) of the sugar will convert to alcohol.  \n\nI prefer a different equation: \n```\nABV% = (0.75 * grams_sugar / 2.0665) / (grams_of_liquid) * 1.26046 * 100  \n```\n0.75 is the estimated yeast attenuation (75% of sugar consumed by the yeast)  \n2.0665 is how many grams of sugar it takes to produce 1 g of alcohol  \n1.26046 is how you convert from alcohol by weight (ABW) to alcohol by volume  \n100 is to turn it into a percent  \n_Using the recipe above as the example again:  \n2 cups of sugar = 400 g  \n1 gallon = 3800 grams of liquid  \nABV% = (0.75 * 400 / 2.0665) / 3800 * 1.26046 * 100 = 4.82%_  \n\nThe amount of alcohol in your hard kombucha will be related to how much sugar you add. For every cup of sugar you add to one gallon of kombucha, you'll add about 2.4-3.1%. So, 1 cup = 2.4%, 2 cups = 4.8%, 3 cups = 7.2%.  \nThe yeast you use will limit how high your ABV can go. For example, Lalvin EC-1118 can go up to 18% ABV (which would require a stunning 7.5 cups of sugar per gallon).  \n\n**Note:**\nYeast attenuation is the amount of sugar (as a percentage) that the yeast will consume. Wine yeasts can often have attenuations above 90%. If you let them ferment until they stop (you stop seeing bubbles rising along the side of your fermentation vessel) you will have a very dry kombucha (like a dry wine).  \nBeer and ale yeast has an attenuation that is between to 65 - 85%. I'm sure some beer/ale yeasts fall outside of that range, but it's a good estimate.  \n\n## Measure the ABV of your kombucha\n\nI have considered 3 ways to measure the alcohol in hard kombucha:\n1. Compare the specific gravity from the start to the finish of fermentation\n    1. This can be done with a hydrometer or refractometer\n    1. Both hydrometer and refractometers have weaknesses\n1. Compare the weight of the kombucha from start to finish of fermentation\n    1. Doing this correctly requires you to account for all weight loss (due to tasting, etc.)\n1. Compare boiling point of finished hard kombucha to boiling point of water\n    1. There is an old but interesting tool for this: ebulliometer\n\nLet's discuss each of these methods:  \n**Note:** During this section I'll mention specific indexes of refraction, densities, etc. Those numbers depend on temperature and concentration. I chose numbers that made sense for kombucha making (where I could find them). Also, there are a variety of equations for these calculations. I chose my favourites.  \n\n### Specific gravity / Hydrometer / Refractometer\n\nThis is the go-to way of measuring alcohol content in beer brewing. Alcohol, water, and sugar solution all have different densities and indexes of refraction. This fact can be used to calculate how much sugar has been consumed and converted to alcohol.  \nUnfortunately, in the case of kombucha there is another important component in the solution--acid. The presence of the acid, and the fact that it is produced by a different process than the alcohol, means that you cannot be as sure of how much alcohol has been produced (or consumed by the bacteria). \nHowever, we can predict what will happen to the refractometer readings when acid is added. The refractometer measures the difference between the index of refraction between water (1.33), sugar water (1.36 for 20% wt/wt solution), and alcohol (1.34 for 10% wt/wt solution). Acetic and gluconic acid both have index of refractions that are higher (1.37 and 1.61) so they will skew the refractometer readings higher than they should be. This will be interpreted as less sugar being consumed and less alcohol present. \nSimilarly, using a hydrometer which measures the density of the water (1.0), sugar water (1.081), and alcohol (0.078). Acetic and gluconic acid both have higher densities (1.049 and 1.240) which skew the hydrometer readings higher. This will cause you to under-estimate the ABV as well.  \n\nI've never used a hydrometer on kombucha. I have used a refractometer on many batches. I took three samples to a local lab to have the ABV analyzed.  \n\nHere are the results:  \n\n|Sample | Refractometer ABV | Lab tested ABV |  \n|:-----:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|  \n|1      | 6.3%              | 7.2%           |  \n|2      | 4.7%              | 5.6%           |  \n|3      | 4.9%              | 6.2%           |  \n\nRMS error: 1.0%  \n**Note:** Notice how the specific gravity ABV estimates are all below that actual ABV. This agrees well with our prediction that it would under-estimate the ABV.\n**Note:** The error depends on fermentation time. Longer fermentation means the refractometer will read an increasingly lower ABV than the actual one. In particular, gluconic acid which is produced later in the fermentation process has a much greater effect on both the refractometer and hydrometer readings.  \n**Note:** The brix reading on the first day or two may actually rise instead of falling. I'm not entirely sure why, I think it has to do with the suspended particles of yeast. It happened on about 50% of my batches.  \n\n#### Equations to calculate ABV from specific gravity\n\nIf you have a refractometer, you must first convert from degrees brix to specific gravity.  \n\n```\nThe first SG is: 1st_SG = (brix / (258.6-((brix / 258.2)*227.1))) + 1\n```\n\nAfter fermentation begins, you need to use a different equation that accounts for the alcohol that is being produced.  \n\n```\nThe final SG is: Final_SG = 1.001843 - 0.002318474 * 1st_SG - 0.000007775 * 1st_SG^2 - 0.000000034 * 1st_SG^3 + 0.00574 * brix + 0.00003344 * brix^2 + 0.000000086 * brix^3\n```\n\nIf you have a hydrometer, or if you've converted your refractometer measurements to specific gravity, you can calculate the ABV with the following equation.  \n```\nABV =(76.08 * (1st_SG - Final_SG) / (1.775 - 1st_SG)) * (Final_SG / 0.794)\n```\n\n**Note:** If you are using a refractometer, the suspended particles/yeast make the refractometer readings harder to see (the line is fuzzy) and it will read a little high. I always refrigerate the kombucha for a day or two to let the yeast settle to the bottom of the container when taking my final refractometer reading.  \n\n\n### Measure weight\n\nThe reason to measure the weight of your kombucha throughout the fermentation process is because most biological processes that consume sugar in kombucha produce CO2. This CO2 is lost to the atmosphere and your kombucha gets lighter. The CO2 loss is related to how much sugar remains in the kombucha and how much alcohol has been produced. You need to be able to measure the weight of the kombucha plus its container with an accuracy around 1 gram. One gram of weight change for a gallon of hard kombucha is 0.03% ABV.    \nThis is not a perfect estimate for the ABV. My equations assume that all sugar is converted to alcohol and nothing else. It will over-estimate the alcohol because it does not account for the glucose that is converted to gluconic acid nor the alcohol that is converted to acetic acid. Because you ferment hard kombucha anaerobically, the alcohol/acetic acid process should slow down (it requires oxygen). The gluconic acid process takes a few days to really get going from what I've read. It's in that paper I linked at the top of this post.  \n\nThis is my main way of tracking my hard kombucha fermentation and what I recommend most people do (if you have a fermentation vessel that you can lift/weigh). Here's how it compared with those same three samples that I had tested:  \n\n|Sample | Weight ABV | Lab tested ABV |  \n|:-----:|:----------:|:--------------:|  \n|1      | 7.3%       | 7.2%           |  \n|2      | 5.7%       | 5.6%           |  \n|3      | 6.6%       | 6.2%           |  \n\nRMS error: 0.2%  \n**Note:** Notice how the estimated ABV is always higher than the actual ABV. That agrees well with our prediction that it would over-estimate ABV. \n\n#### Equations to calculate ABV from weight\n\nFirst, before you ever start fermenting, you need to record the weight of your fermentation vessel including lid (this is your vessel_weight_grams). After you've put together all of the ingredients of your hard kombucha, immediately weigh the total weight of kombucha and vessel (this is your initial_weight).\n\nHere are the equations that should help you calculate the ABV:  \n```\nCO2_lost_grams = initial_weight - current_weight\nalcohol_grams = 1.0455 * CO2_lost_grams\nalcohol_by_weight_percent = alcohol_grams / (current_weight - vessel_weight_grams) * 100\nalcohol_by_volume_percent = 1.26046 * alcohol_by_weight_percent\n```\nSince we noticed that the reading is always a little high, the true ABV is probably about 0.2% below what you calculate.  \n\nAdditionally, if you want to track the amount of sugar that remains in your kombucha.\n```\nsugar_consumed_grams = 2.16048 * CO2_lost_grams\nsugar_remaining_percent = (initial_sugar_grams - sugar_consumed_grams) / initial_sugar_grams * 100\n```\n\nI recommending weighing your hard kombucha most days. It will let you see how the fermentation is progressing. You can stop the fermentation exactly when you want based on your taste preference.  \n\n### Measure boiling point of kombucha\n\nAdding alcohol to water decreases the boiling point of the solution. The process to estimate the ABV is fairly simple. Measure the boiling point of water (it should be near 100 C, but will change based on your altitude and atmospheric pressure in your area). Measure the boiling point of your kombucha. Subtract the boiling point of your kombucha from the boiling point of the water to get a 'delta_temperature'. Calculate the ABV.  \nAgain, I would like to predict what effect the acid will have on this method of estimating ABV. The boiling points of our ingredients are: water (100 C), ethanol (78 C), acetic acid (118 C), and gluconic acid (I can't find a good number other than \"greater than 100 C\"). The acids will again offset the decreasing boiling point due to the alcohol and will cause an under-estimation of ABV. \nOne cool aspect of this method is that you don't need to do any measurements before fermentation.  \n\n\nDemonstration of how this works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM1ST2Yd-XU\n\nIn that video they use a plastic wheel that acts like a slide rule. You can buy them online for $40+. Or use these equations. In the following equations, temperatures are in centigrade.\n\n```\ntemp_delta = water_boiling_temp - kombucha_boiling_temp\nABV = 0.122 + 0.865 * temp_delta + 0.0603 * temp_delta^2\n```\nTo convert fahrenheit to centigrade:\n```\ntemp_centigrade = (temp_fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n```\n\nI attempted several tests to see if I could do this without the ebulliometer. I tried heating water on a stove or in a microwave while using a kitchen thermometer. It was a failure. My ABV results were off by 1 to 2%. If anyone has an ebulliometer and has some data, I would love to see it.  \n\n**Note:** The equation for ABV was created by fitting a polynomial to the table in this document: https://www.umpqua.edu/images/areas-of-study/career-technical/viticulture-enology/downloads/conferences/technical-symposia/2014-dec-wine-chemistry/2014-ts-ethanol.pdf\n\n### Hard kombucha with just kombucha yeast\n\nI wanted to gain some understanding of whether kombucha yeast on its own could make hard kombucha. In this experiment I followed the same recipe that I always use for hard kombucha but I ommitted adding wine/ale yeast. Going into the experiment, I've read that kombucha yeast does not tolerate alcohol levels above 2%. In a variety of long-running academic experiments, I've only seen ABVs in the 0.5-0.7% range.  \n\nThe experiment ran for 21 days with the following results:\n+ 13 grams of CO2 lost (1 quart of liquid)\n+ ABV estimated from weight loss: 2.1%\n+ ABV estimated from refractometer readings: 1.6%\n+ Taste is like very sweet tea. Just a hint of kombucha tang.\n\nThis experiment gives me more confidence that kombucha yeast alone will not produce much alcohol. The refractometer readings are not what I expected. I anticipated that the brix readings would dip slightly and then begin to rise as acetic and gluconic acids are produced. I am unsure what combination of processes could result in little CO2 production and a drop in the index of refraction.  \n\n### My final thoughts\n\nIf you want to try out some hard kombucha. I recommend you start small (make only a quart/litre) and use a kitchen food scale (they are really cheap) to track your fermentation by weight. Make a little spreadsheet to keep track of your progress. If it turns out gross just iterate a few times. Try a different yeast, more or less kombucha, etc. Don't expect it to work every time.  \nMaking hard kombucha has been a super fun experiment for me. I've learned a ton about all the biological processes in kombucha and beer. I've read a lot of academic papers. I've made nearly two dozen batches, varying sugar concentration and type, yeast, kombucha concentration, temperature, fermentation time, etc. The results haven't always been great. Some of it was super tasty and some was just miserable. I've dumped out many batches after just a few tastes.  \nThis post is my attempt to collect the lessons that I've learned over the past few months. It is based on my experiments and my research. Any mistakes I've made are done in good faith. If you notice an error, please point it out to me along with some supporting evidence and I'll update my post. If you have any interesting data about your own kombucha experiments, I'd love to hear about it.  \n\nEdit 1: fixing markdown for tables.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/dpu894/everything_i_know_about_making_hard_kombucha_long/", "created_utc": 1572557112.0, "score": 191, "author": "b7500af1", "num_comments": 63, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/dpu894/everything_i_know_about_making_hard_kombucha_long/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "The pellicle is not a useless cellulose raft", "selftext": "It seems like there have been quite a few posts where people are telling folks that the SCOBY is the liquid and that the pellicle is just a cellulose byproduct. While it is very true that you can start a batch of kombucha  without a pellicle, it\u2019s not true that it\u2019s just a useless byproduct.\n\nThe SCOBY is the community of bacteria and yeast cells in kombucha. There are bacteria and yeast cells in the liquid. There are also bacteria and yeast cells in the pellicle. Both the liquid and the pellicle contain a SCOBY.\n\nThe pellicle is a biofilm, a matrix built by the bacteria. The bacteria in the liquid is in a planktonic (free-floating) state. The bacteria in the pellicle are in a sessile (adhered to a surface) state. The pellicle also contains significant quantities of yeast, which the bacteria use as a scaffold while building their biofilm. Bacteria build biofilms for many reasons including protection, to access nutrients, and for community benefits including the exchange of DNA.\n\nYes, you can throw away the pellicle after every batch and a new one will form. There are plenty of bacteria and yeast in the liquid to get a batch going. The liquid is enough, by itself, to start a new batch. You are, however, tossing a bunch of bacteria and yeast when you do so.\n\nYou generally can\u2019t start a batch with just the pellicle, which is probably where the idea that it\u2019s useless comes from. There are actually plenty of bacteria and yeast in the pellicle to start a batch of kombucha. The problem is that, without starter liquid to quickly lower the ph of your sweet tea, the brew won\u2019t be acidic enough, fast enough, to prevent the growth of mold and other undesirable microbes that can live in less acidic environments. \n\nTLDR: the pellicle contains lots of bacteria and yeast, just like the liquid. It\u2019s not enough by itself to start a batch of kombucha, but it\u2019s also not a useless inert mass of cellulose.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1gsdi9i/the_pellicle_is_not_a_useless_cellulose_raft/", "created_utc": 1731724635.0, "score": 178, "author": "BedrockPoet", "num_comments": 77, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1gsdi9i/the_pellicle_is_not_a_useless_cellulose_raft/", "html_title": ""}

I can really recommend the bottles; it really took the guesswork out of whether it carbonated or not, as a beginner at least. After just one day, the bottles were hard, and after a day and a half, the bottles were rock hard. For the flavor, I have a cold right now, but it tastes pleasant, maybe it could have had a bit more juice in it!

{"title": "So... My kombucha exploded", "selftext": "My first batch exploded on the second day (the end of it) of second fermentation. It happened in December last year and that made me dreadful for trying the second batch. However, now is the day. I've done the first fermentation of my second batch and I'm ready to bottle up for second fermentation. But I need to ask you for advice and maybe ask some questions about what could've gone wrong the last time and how can I prevent it. \n\nSo I used those bottles from Amazon. They seemed sturdy and strong enough. I also used a heating mat that is used for growing seeds. It was December so it was cold, that's why I decided to use it for my bottles. They were just standing on the mat. I assume that mat accelerated the fermentation, but I'd have never thought it would lead to explosion. I used various different flavours, but don't think that matters as the explosion caused chain reaction breaking 3 bottles with different flavours so I don't know which one could've caused the issue. But I can say that I eyeballed the sugar that I added because I wanted it to be highly carbonated and sweet (and I paid for it). \n\nSo my question is what do you think could've gone wrong? Was it the quality of bottles (assuming they're weaker than I thought), heating mat or the amount of sugar I used? Or mix of everything? What would you suggest for second fermentation? Is there a limit for how much added sugar can I use? Should I ditch the heating mat (it's usually cold in my house)? \n\nI'll appreciate any help!

This has been driving me so crazy that I am almost at the point of checking my prostate health. In short without getting too graphic my dick just feels loose or relaxed all the way up to my prostate. Thats the only way I would describe it, like its not enjoyable, but not unenjoyable, it just present. Like five minutes after drinking it, the sensation will set in and I just like to have to function while being hyperaware of my prostate. I should clarify I had never felt my prostate once till I started drinking kombucha and I swear to god I am not drinking it still because I like what it does to me, I have a bidet for that. I just have a peculiar stomach, and I have convinced myself kombucha will tame my anus. Has anybody a clue what I am going on about or is it time I find a proctologist.

If you're wondering what's growing on your kombucha and if it's normal, you've come to the right place.\n\nPlease review this information before posting a picture of your batch to the subreddit.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Dry + fuzzy on the surface of the liquid/pellicle/SCOBY is most likely mold: mold pics [https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi](https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi)\n* Geometric growths or wrinkly patterns on the surface of the liquid/pellicle/SCOBY could be kahm yeast: kahm pics [https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox](https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox)\n* Anything else and anything under the liquid level is most likely normal: normal pics [https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv](https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv)\n* If you're not sure, wait a few more days: mold or kahm will get more obvious as they grow, normal will stay about the same or form into new pellicle/SCOBY\n* If the kombucha is already bottled for carbonation (commonly called second ferment or 2F), mold/kahm is very unlikely due to the high acidity and lack of oxygen access.\n* Always use at least 2 cups of starter per gallon (125ml/L) when making kombucha to acidify the batch: high acidity (pH < 4.6) protects the kombucha from mold and kahm. \n* Read our getting started guide for brewing tips: [https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how\\_to\\_start](https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how_to_start)\n\n**Terminology**: in this guide, \"pellicle/SCOBY\" refers to the rubbery blob that forms at the surface of a batch of kombucha. SCOBY stands for \"symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast\", and those bacteria + yeast are found both in the liquid kombucha and in the solid rubbery blob. The rubbery blob's more accurate scientific name is \"pellicle\": it's a biofilm/mat of bacterial cellulose secreted by and connected to the bacteria forming it (some yeast also live in the pellicle). Culturally, however, the term \"SCOBY\" widely refers to the pellicle so this guide uses both terms.\n\nRead more about pellicles here:\n\n* [https://fermentaholics.com/whats-that-white-waxy-layer-growing-on-my-kombucha-brew/](https://fermentaholics.com/whats-that-white-waxy-layer-growing-on-my-kombucha-brew/)\n* [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12073](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12073) (scroll to \"Tea fungus (fungal biomass) and its applications\" section)\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002013001846](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002013001846)\n\n**Diagnostic Quiz**\n\n1 ) Is the growth/odd thing on the top surface (exposed to air) of the liquid kombucha or existing pellicle/SCOBY?\n\n* Yes - go to 2\n* No - go to 8\n\n2 ) Is the kombucha already bottled for carbonation (commonly called second ferment or 2F)?\n\n* Yes - likely pellicle/SCOBY growth (it can happen in 2F!) or a yeast cluster. Mold/kahm are extremely rare in 2F due to the high acidity (pH <4.2) and lack of oxygen access (required for mold to grow). Booch on!\n* No - go to 3\n\n3 ) Is the growth dry and fuzzy looking with white or green color, and/or with black spores growing out of it?\n\n* Yes - likely mold. Go to Mold section for pictures.\n* No - go to 4\n\n4 ) Is the growth a wrinkly or geometric pattern, very rough patterned surface, or very large air-y bubbles that cover large areas of the surface?\n\n* Yes - likely kahm yeast. Go to Kahm section for pictures.\n* No - go to 5\n\n5 ) Is the growth one of: white/translucent + wet, disconnected oily/patchy sections, or a thin film with bubbles trapped underneath?\n\n* Yes - likely normal pellicle/SCOBY growth. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 6\n\n6 ) Is the growth flat, leathery, and brown?\n\n* Yes - likely a dried out pellicle/SCOBY area. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 7\n\n7 ) Is the the growth brown/black, wet, and partially/completely surrounded by pellicle/SCOBY?\n\n* Yes - likely a yeast cluster. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - probably normal, but review all Normal, Kahm, and Mold pictures to be safe.\n\n8 ) Is the growth/odd thing completely submerged in liquid?\n\n* Yes - likely yeast. Yeast can form dark brown clumps in the liquid or on the pellicle/SCOBY, or alien-like formations suspended in the liquid. Mold and kahm cannot grow beneath the surface of the liquid without also showing on the surface exposed to air. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 2\n\n**Normal**\n\nGallery of normal kombucha: [https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv](https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv)\n\nPellicles/SCOBYs have a **ton** of natural variation. A normal pellicle/SCOBY should look wet, tan/white/translucent, and be mostly smooth (some bumps are normal). There may also be wet brown/black yeast blobs that attach to the liquid side of the pellicle/SCOBY, get absorbed into the pellicle/SCOBY, or float around inside the liquid.\n\n**Mold**\n\nGallery of mold: [https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi](https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi)\n\nMold occurs when the kombucha is not acidic enough (pH < 4.6) to prevent mold organisms from growing. Other factors that make mold more likely are unsanitary conditions and cold brewing temperatures (<65F/18C).\n\nIf there is mold on your batch:\n\n* You **must throw away everything** (liquid + pellicle/SCOBY) and start from scratch with fresh starter tea. By the time mold is visible on the surface of the brew, it has already contaminated the entire batch.\n* Sanitize the vessel, cloth cover, and any utensils used in brewing with a homebrew sanitizing solution (StarSan, OneStep, SaniClean, potassium metabisulfite, etc) or throughly wash with soap + hot water followed by a pasteurized distilled vinegar rinse (no raw vinegar, which contains live microbe cultures).\n\nTo prevent mold, **the most important thing is to use at least 2 cups of starter tea per 1 gallon of kombucha (125ml per L)** to acidify the batch. Starter tea is mature kombucha: either from a previous batch (yours or a friend's), from a SCOBY hotel, or from raw/unflavored/unpasteurized commercial kombucha such as GTs or Health-Ade. \n\nThis amount of starter tea is a good rule of thumb for safe acidity: if you have a pH meter or strips, check that the starting pH is <4.6. Another important factor is maintaining clean/sanitary brewing practices: however, because kombucha is an open air ferment some mold organisms may get in even with a cloth cover, which is why acidity is also important.\n\n**Kahm Yeast**\n\nGallery of kahm: [https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox](https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox)\n\n\u201cKahm\u201d is a generic term for many species of usually non-harmful but also non-desirable wild yeast that can take hold in kombucha (outcompete the kombucha culture) and appear as surface growths on the the pellicle/SCOBY. Kahm often looks geometric or wrinkly vs the smooth/bumpy normal pellicle/SCOBY.\n\nSee this excellent writeup about the science of kahm yeast from u/daileta in r/fermentation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/ytg2vy/kahm_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/ytg2vy/kahm_down/) Their post is focused on lacto fermented vegetables (not kombucha) but is worth a read. \n\nKahm itself isn\u2019t usually dangerous, but to quote our resident food microbiologist u/Albino_Echidna:  \u201cKahm is a term used to lump a whole bunch of unwanted yeasts together, all of which are indicative of an unsafe fermentation environment. Kahm growth is indicative of a fermentation gone wrong. 'Kahm' itself isn\u2019t harmful, but it is a warning sign that your environment wasn\u2019t quite right and will be at higher risk of pathogenic growth as a result.\"\n\nIf your batch has kahm, it is up to you whether to toss + sanitize + start over with fresh starter kombucha or to try to scrape off the kahm from the surface and continue brewing. **It is always safest to toss and restart** \\- see the instructions in the Mold section.\n\nTo help prevent kahm, use at least 2 cups of starter tea per 1 gallon of kombucha (125ml per L) to strongly establish the kombucha culture and acidify the batch. Kahm may also be related to unsanitary conditions, high brewing temperature (>85F/30C), or oversteeping tea (>1hr, but may vary).\n\n**Further reading:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/whats\\_wrong**](https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/whats_wrong)\n\n**If you still aren\u2019t sure after comparing your batch to the pictures here, please make a post and ask!**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/pqu7oq/is_it_mold_is_it_normal_whats_growing_in_your/", "created_utc": 1631998127.0, "score": 474, "author": "mehmagix", "num_comments": 122, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/pqu7oq/is_it_mold_is_it_normal_whats_growing_in_your/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Hopped kombucha", "selftext": "The bottle hopped with citra had dialed back bitterness, and this pleasant honey-like note, without much aroma.

The cold macerated booch tasted amazing, the hop characters and aromas shone through beautifully, sadly infusing just 200 ml was not enough. Since the bulk of it was infused with hops at relatively high room temp (around 30\u00b0C) with open air exchange, a lot of hop aroma was lost to the air around day three of F2. That said, the end result of this experiment was definitely not disappointing, the booch tastes great for what it is.

{"title": "Mold + Zero Carbonation in 2nd Fermentation after successful first batch??", "selftext": "Hi! Looking for some advice on what went wrong here...\n\n**My first batch:**\n\nI made a super successful first batch of Kombucha following[ this guide](https://www.youbrewkombucha.com/guide-to-first-fermentation) to the T. I used [this SCOBY + tea starter](https://a.co/d/cbiLEW4). I have [this heat pad](https://a.co/d/8wpdDby) which keeps the 1 gallon glass bottle at around 80 degrees F. First fermentation went for 11 days, second fermentation I added blended raspberry, lemon juice, and ginger (some had jalape\u00f1o as well) and put them in [these bottles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LB1862A?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_10&th=1). Went for about 5 days. They all tasted great, with good carbonation, and no issues.\n\n**My second batch:**\n\nEverything about the setup was the same. I cleaned the bottles with dish soap, water, and bottle brushes -- leaving them open and on a window sill in the sun to dry as I'm on the coast and it's humid here. I wanted to get a more tart and carbonated brew this time around so I made some changes with that in mind. I let the 1st fermentation go for 13 days. Went with the same general recipe for the 2nd fermentation of raspberries, lemon juice, and ginger -- though I added more ginger, more lemon juice, and more jalape\u00f1o. I experimented with a mango + tamarind (kombuchelada attempt) in one bottle.\n\nFive days into 2nd fermentation and there is no carbonation. 6 days in I start to see what I think is mold forming in one of the bottles. I'm 7 days now and there is still no carbonation in the bottles. I've tasted one and it seems okay but not the best tasting/ no carbonation.  \n  \nThe mango tamarind experiment is actually incredibly carbonated and tastes pretty good with no visible mold that I noticed. This leads me to believe it's a problem with the ingredients in the raspberry lemon ginger bottles.\n\nI have another 1st fermentation (from the same SCOBY) going on day 7 now and it all seems healthy with no mold visible. So I really don't think the mold came from the 1st fermentation despite the internet saying that's likely the case.\n\n**My best theories:**  \n\\- not enough sugar because the ratio of ingredients I used decreased the raspberries and the longer 1st fermentation resulted in less sugar as I bottled  \n\\- too cold in 2nd fermentation (mid to high 60s in my house, heat pad isn't used as it's hard to wrap it around 7 bottles)  \n\\- The fruit and/or lemon juice I used was maybe too old and had already started to develop mold I didn't notice  \n\\- Was not sanitary somehow and contaminants were introduced to the \"clean\" bottles -- though this wouldn't explain the lack of carbonation\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mudiq30agnxe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f993c705b03cd0c709a2caf9e62d95d7c563807\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zydfy10agnxe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe2dd0a6e99922b8a5d2a821b001a8ee25387090\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2a2zz0agnxe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e1f971735db797750425074f9c4435d1b271a60", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1ka8623/mold_zero_carbonation_in_2nd_fermentation_after/", "created_utc": 1745878403.0, "score": 1, "author": "HardToBeAHumanBeing", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1ka8623/mold_zero_carbonation_in_2nd_fermentation_after/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

So I tried longer fermentation but then it tasted really acidic.\n\nA bit frustrated I searched on the internet and bought myself a Refractometer and measured my Kombucha.\n\nThe result was more than disappointing, according to the Refractometer my Kombucha was at 10mg/100ml which is basically worse than coke.\n\nI let it ferment further (10+ days) but barely got it <5g/100ml where it just tasted like vinegar.\n\nTo varify that the Refractometer works correctly I also did some tests with:\n\n\\- water + specific sugar amount\n\n\\- store bought Kombucha\n\n\\- Beer\n\nFor the first two, the measurements where on point but for the beer it also showed a very high amount, even though there should be technically no sugar inside...\n\nAfter a short research here on reddit, I found some comments that a Refractometer is not suited for Kombucha.  \nI didn't really understand why, isn't it used specifically for brewing purposes?\n\nAnd I also got accurate readings for my store bought Kombucha.\n\nSo long story short:\n\nCan someone tell me if my Refractometer readings are accurate or if I cannot use it for measuring the sugar content of Kombucha?\n\nIf not, how do you check how much sugar is in your Kombucha?

Is it worthwhile to add more sugar to the batch to speed up fermentation? \n\n2) For secondary fermentation is infection an issue or does the acidity typically take care of this? Is bret infection common? \n\n3) For bottling, is it recommended to add sugar in similar amounts as in beer/cider for sparkling kombucha? In case I want to sweeten the kombucha without increasing carbonation, can I use xylit? \n\n4) Has anyone experimented with hopped (in 2nd fermentation) kombucha and can recommend hop varieties that work well? Does the antibacterial property of hop play a role? \n\n5) I am reading that unflavoured green and black tea are best for first fermentation. What are things to keep in mind for fruit tea varieties? \n\n6) The first attempt is tasty but a bit on the acidic side.

Does it necessary to actually wait for 7-10 days or is it depends on how I like my kombucha taste? And if I already like the taste, do I have to keep the batch in different jar or I can just add sweet tea to it?\n\n2) I read that it will keep ferment until forever if all the microorganisms are healthy. So of I were to take a small amount of the liquid from my glass jar put it in another small jar and leave it on the counter, will it ferment as well? \n\n3) if I initially use black tea for the kombucha in my first batch, can I use green tea to brew the second batch and using the starter from the first batch? \n\n4) does the amount of teabags influence the taste of the kombucha? \n\nI\u2019m sorry if I asked too many questions because I googles everything but I couldn\u2019t get the answer.

With the Anvil, I found this post showing a cover made with a 12 inch embroidery hoop which would be great to have:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/jm20hb/i\\_was\\_sick\\_of\\_my\\_cloth\\_cover\\_falling\\_in\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/jm20hb/i_was_sick_of_my_cloth_cover_falling_in_the/)\n\n  \nI'm sure I could find something to use with the Delta FermTank though to cover it like that.  From what I've read it sounds like the Delta might be higher quality?  I just wasn't able to find much information about the spigot on it and how it compares to the spigot on the Anvil bucket, the last thing I want is 5+ gallons of booch leaking out.\n\n  \nThank you and happy brewing!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1ju14qn/help_deciding_between_two_ss_fermenting_buckets/", "created_utc": 1744073276.0, "score": 1, "author": "LikeAChicken", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1ju14qn/help_deciding_between_two_ss_fermenting_buckets/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "My Amazon SCOBY Disaster & Recovery Attempt! Advice Nee", "selftext": "I've got a perplexing kombucha situation and desperately need some experienced advice.\n\nAbout a month ago, I bought a SCOBY online (Amazon). I followed the instructions and brewed my sweet tea, adding the starter liquid and the pellicle. After two weeks, I was expecting some tang, but the tea was still overwhelmingly sweet. I also noticed the pellicle had sunk to the bottom, which seemed odd based on my previous brewing experience.\n\nThen came the concerning part: when I fished out the original Amazon SCOBY, it was really dark in color. It didn't look healthy at all, and frankly, I was worried it had died or something was wrong, so I ended up throwing it away.\n\nThinking the batch might still be salvageable, I took a healthy-looking pellicle layer from another batch that was fermenting perfectly and dropped it into the questionable (still very sweet) tea.\n\nNow, it's been about two weeks since I added the new pellicle. I'm seeing the pellicle floating on top and even forming new layers, which is what I'd expect from a healthy fermentation.\n\nHowever, I'm really worried about the initial two weeks where the original (dark, sunken) SCOBY was in the sweet tea. Could there have been any undesirable bacteria or mold growth that I didn't see? Is this batch still safe to drink or use as starter liquid, even though the new SCOBY seems to be doing its thing?\n\nMy main concerns are:\n\n* **Safety:** Could the initial period with the potentially dead/bad SCOBY have contaminated the batch in a way that's now masked by the new fermentation?\n* **Taste:** Even if safe, will the flavor be off due to the prolonged sweet period?\n* **Starter Liquid:** If the new fermentation progresses, would you trust this batch to be used as starter liquid for future brews?\n\nHas anyone else experienced a dark, sunken SCOBY from an online purchase? What did you do? Any advice on whether I should proceed with this batch or just cut my losses and start fresh with a known good starter?\n\nThanks so much for your help!

Process for my first batch: I got a SCOBY from a friend and brewed a mini batch to get up to \\~4L. Then, for my first full batch, I brewed about 20L total using a ratio of 5g black tea/50g cane sugar/1L water and cooled it to about 95F. I used a sort of partial boil method where I boiled half volume of water, turned off the stove and steeped the tea for a few mins, added sugar, then added the remaining water volume to get to target pitch temp. I pitched the \\~4L of starter + SCOBY. I fermented in a 7gal SSBrewtech brew bucket with a fermwrap and InkBird monitor set to 78F. Fermented for about 3wks, transferred about 20L to a keg, flavored, and enjoyed on tap for a month. :)  I left several liters in the fermenter at room temp so I would have starter for the next batch. Cleaned the fermenter before starting batch 2.\n\nJust did my second batch, similar format. This picture is from about a week in. It seems to be behaving differently than my first batch.\n\n1.

{"title": "Why you shouldn\u2019t add sugar directly to boiling tea when brewing Kombucha", "selftext": "If you\u2019re brewing kombucha, you know that tea and sugar are the foundation of the fermentation process. BUT there\u2019s a common mistake that can subtly affect your brew - adding sugar directly to boiling tea. It might seem harmless, after all, sugar dissolves easily in hot liquid. But the temperature matters more than you think.\n\nTable sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide, meaning it\u2019s made of two simpler sugars: glucose and fructose. During kombucha fermentation, the SCOBY naturally breaks sucrose down into these components, which the microbes then consume.\n\nHowever, if you add sugar directly to boiling tea, a premature breakdown can happen. That is, high heat speeds up the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose before the fermentation even begins. While the SCOBY can still use these sugars, faster breakdown of sucrose can lead to quicker acid production, potentially making the kombucha too sour too soon.\n\nWith that being said, the microbes in your SCOBY have evolved to break down sucrose gradually. When that process is altered, it may impact fermentation speed, acidity, and flavor complexity.\n\nInstead of dumping sugar into boiling tea, wait until the temperature drops to around 70\u201380\u00b0C (160\u2013175\u00b0F). This is still hot enough to dissolve the sugar completely but not so hot that it alters its chemical structure. After dissolving, let the mixture cool to room temperature before adding the SCOBY, as high temperatures can kill the beneficial bacteria and yeast.

Healthy and delicious, even started forming a pellicle!\n* I added brewer's yeast along with more sweet tea and flavorings (\\~6 cups sugar) to kick off F1\n* Last week, when I finally brought it out. Brix (via cheap tester) was like 3; I added more sweet tea and flavorings (\\~3 cups sugar + strawberry preserves + other) in prep for bottling (after bottling \\~5L to make room), and gave it another week. Brix is presently \\~7, so just over double of where it started. No idea on ABV / etc.\n\nAs of this point in time, I will most likely be using this batch as a concentrated mixer for tequila and such. I do plan to add some additional sweetener in the interest of carbonation since I kept the fermentation heating wrap going over this past week.\n\nI am presently experimenting with different ratios of F2 to sweetener for bottling (note: I do not want it anywhere near as sweet as a traditional shrub).

The BIG thing that I do still want to achieve is strong, (but not TOO strong!) carbonation. From past experience, I do expect that this will take a lot more time than normal to carbonate due to the acidity and residual brewer's yeast (right?), and that is fine if so.

{"title": "What is happening to my jun?", "selftext": "I started brewing kombucha at the beginning of this year, and transitioned to jun a couple months ago. This is my 5th or 6th batch of jun and they\u2019ve all been perfectly fine, except this one - it has a bunch of floating bits in it (yeast, I\u2019m assuming), which I know is normal, to a degree. However, I just started this batch today - about 12 hours prior to taking the photos. It just seems like really fast development of something I haven\u2019t really noticed before - and there\u2019s A LOT of it. \nThe only thing that I did differently with this round, is that I left the previous batch to ferment for too long (had a rough week - left the first fermentation for about 10 days, instead of my usual 5-6). I knew the previous batch would end up undrinkable at this point, but I assumed I could still use it as starter? \nNow I don\u2019t know what could be causing these floaty bits, I\u2019m guessing the over-fermented starter has something to do with it? \n\nMy main question is, is my SCOBY ruined? \nThe pellicle is completely smooth on top, so no mold or kahm visible (unless the stuff below indicates otherwise). \nShould I dump this asap and try again with a less vinegar-y starter? \n(I still have about 500ml from two batches ago, but that one\u2019s past it\u2019s second fermentation and currently chilling in the fridge) \nOr should I just let it live its best life for the next 4-5 days and see how it develops?\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!

Bottle sometimes pops ever so slightly when you open it, so there is something going on... But not enough for any serious bubbles in the drink. Any suggestions?\n\nP.S. I used to use filtered RO water from the store, but I recently switched to carbon filtered because of low mineral concerns. Thought I might add some sea salt and a dash of molasses to help with minerals. That did get the flavor to develop a rich fruity note, but still no carbonation.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/csz5btmtbeye1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1746203837.0, "score": 1, "author": "Agile-Grape-535", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1kd5h78/flat_kombucha/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Mold + Zero Carbonation in 2nd Fermentation after successful first batch??", "selftext": "Hi! Looking for some advice on what went wrong here...\n\n**My first batch:**\n\nI made a super successful first batch of Kombucha following[ this guide](https://www.youbrewkombucha.com/guide-to-first-fermentation) to the T. I used [this SCOBY + tea starter](https://a.co/d/cbiLEW4). I have [this heat pad](https://a.co/d/8wpdDby) which keeps the 1 gallon glass bottle at around 80 degrees F. First fermentation went for 11 days, second fermentation I added blended raspberry, lemon juice, and ginger (some had jalape\u00f1o as well) and put them in [these bottles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LB1862A?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_10&th=1). Went for about 5 days. They all tasted great, with good carbonation, and no issues.\n\n**My second batch:**\n\nEverything about the setup was the same. I cleaned the bottles with dish soap, water, and bottle brushes -- leaving them open and on a window sill in the sun to dry as I'm on the coast and it's humid here. I wanted to get a more tart and carbonated brew this time around so I made some changes with that in mind. I let the 1st fermentation go for 13 days. Went with the same general recipe for the 2nd fermentation of raspberries, lemon juice, and ginger -- though I added more ginger, more lemon juice, and more jalape\u00f1o. I experimented with a mango + tamarind (kombuchelada attempt) in one bottle.\n\nFive days into 2nd fermentation and there is no carbonation. 6 days in I start to see what I think is mold forming in one of the bottles. I'm 7 days now and there is still no carbonation in the bottles. I've tasted one and it seems okay but not the best tasting/ no carbonation.  \n  \nThe mango tamarind experiment is actually incredibly carbonated and tastes pretty good with no visible mold that I noticed. This leads me to believe it's a problem with the ingredients in the raspberry lemon ginger bottles.\n\nI have another 1st fermentation (from the same SCOBY) going on day 7 now and it all seems healthy with no mold visible. So I really don't think the mold came from the 1st fermentation despite the internet saying that's likely the case.\n\n**My best theories:**  \n\\- not enough sugar because the ratio of ingredients I used decreased the raspberries and the longer 1st fermentation resulted in less sugar as I bottled  \n\\- too cold in 2nd fermentation (mid to high 60s in my house, heat pad isn't used as it's hard to wrap it around 7 bottles)  \n\\- The fruit and/or lemon juice I used was maybe too old and had already started to develop mold I didn't notice  \n\\- Was not sanitary somehow and contaminants were introduced to the \"clean\" bottles -- though this wouldn't explain the lack of carbonation\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mudiq30agnxe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f993c705b03cd0c709a2caf9e62d95d7c563807\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zydfy10agnxe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe2dd0a6e99922b8a5d2a821b001a8ee25387090\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2a2zz0agnxe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e1f971735db797750425074f9c4435d1b271a60", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1ka8623/mold_zero_carbonation_in_2nd_fermentation_after/", "created_utc": 1745878403.0, "score": 1, "author": "HardToBeAHumanBeing", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1ka8623/mold_zero_carbonation_in_2nd_fermentation_after/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I learnt that SCOBY isn't really necessary for kombucha, as long as enough starter is added, so when I made it I added only a small slice of SCOBY, not enough to cover the surface.\n\nSince then the small slice of SCOBY has sank to the bottom and a pellicle later formed on the first week which sank when I moved the jar around to check the kombucha. The SCOBY slice I added and this pellicle has amalgamated into whatever can be seen on the second picture and is just staying in the bottom, while another pellicle has formed on the top, had to move the jar a bit to get the picture so pellicle isn't perfectly aligned anymore.\n\nSo my questions are:\n1. Is this normal? \n2.

Having a worse ratio than sodas would render my whole idea about Kombucha invalid.\n\nThank you in advance :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1k0erdm/how_do_you_handle_sugar_content_of_your_kombucha/", "created_utc": 1744789102.0, "score": 10, "author": "Evox402", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1k0erdm/how_do_you_handle_sugar_content_of_your_kombucha/", "html_title": ""}

Last year in June (2024) I started this brew with a bought diy kit. Loved making kombucha for the summer! Then I forgot about the kombucha in the winter and left it on the countertop for something like six months. (I don\u2019t know exactly to be honest!). Now the scoby looks like this. How can I start again making kombucha with it? Or should I rather toss it out and buy a new scoby? The whole time it was standing on the kitchen counter, in a relatively shaded corner. Next to it was a fruit bowl, where in between a pumpkin picked up mold and I noticed it a bit late. So I am afraid that the scoby turned bad, but from the looks, there does not appear to be mold.
