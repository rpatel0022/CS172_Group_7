I use milk-egg yolk base for the first two, and they went out great as it used to be. However, the rest t that w/o egg yolk ended up with a buttery flavor, it tastes like eating a block of butter.\n\nMy recipe was designed to aim for: \n\n1. 65% water \n2. 9% fat \n3. 26% milk solid nonfat (MSNF) including lactose, Casin, whey, flavor molecule, and sugar\n   * 9.75% glucose (sugar)\n\nIf my information was correct, the composition plays a crucial rule on the texture.

{"title": "\ud83c\udf4b FINALLY, MY LEMON BAR ICE CREAM RECIPE! \ud83c\udf4b", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI wanted to finally share my Lemon Bar Ice Cream recipe as a token of my appreciation! I am so darn sorry for the time it is taking my cookbook to hit store shelves, and I know many of you are anxious to try my recipes. This flavor was my top seller when I was wholesaling pints in Seattle. It is an intensely Lemon ice cream with pieces of homemade Lemon Bars - with a buttery shortbread crust which is one of my favorite parts! After reviewing the recipe, please let me know if you have any questions. Also, if you make it, please let us know your thoughts! \n\nLastly, follows on SM matter the most to publishers. My handles are in my profile. Obviously, no pressure and thank you for considering. Thank you, too, for all of your support and encouragement you have shared along the way! May you cherish and love this recipe just as I and so many folks in Seattle have! \n\nMost warmly,\nLauren \nSweet Lo\u2019s Ice Cream \n\n\nMy Famous Lemon Bar \n\nThis is one of my most sought after recipes! Behind Cookies N Cream, Lemon Bar was the second most popular flavor sold in grocery stores in Seattle. Luscious lemon ice cream chock full of homemade lemon bars. My favorite part is the buttery crust of the lemon bar mixed with the tangy, sweet ice cream. Even if you\u2019re not necessarily a fan of lemon, this combination has the power to change your mind and buds! \n\nYield: about 2 quarts \n\nIntensely Lemon Ice Cream Base \n\nZest of 3 large lemons separated\n1 cup (200g) white sugar\n1 \u00bd cups (368g) whole milk\n1 \u00bd cups (357g) heavy cream\n\u00bc cup (33g) nonfat dry milk powder\n\u00bc tsp (1.3g) salt\n\u00be cup (172.5g) lemon juice, from the 3 lemons you zested \n3 (54g) egg yolks\n\n2 cups lemon bars, chopped (recipe below) \n\nBefore starting, set aside a medium sized bowl (one with a lid) with a fine mesh strainer on top. \n\n1. Zest all three lemons. Add the sugar and \u00be of the lemon zest to a small bowl and massage the zest into the sugar until combined.\n2. In a medium-sized heavy bottom saucepan, add the whole milk, heavy cream, nonfat dry milk powder, sugar and salt. Heat over low to medium heat, gently bringing the mixture up to a low simmer. Simmer for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously until all ingredients are dissolved. Remove from heat, cover the saucepan, and allow to steep for 20 minutes.\n3. While the dairy mixture is steeping, juice the three lemons. Strain the pulp and seeds. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the pulp and add it back into the juice. Put the juice in a jar with a lid, and set aside in the refrigerator. It will be added to the base, once the base has cooled completely.\n4. After 20 minutes, uncover the saucepan and bring mixture back to a simmer over low heat. While the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\n5. Once the dairy mixture is warm, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn heat to medium. As the yolks warm, you\u2019ll notice the mixture start to thicken.\nContinue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon and registers about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer, about 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer. \n6. Allow the base to cool at room temperature for an hour. Add a lid and refrigerate for 5 hours. Once the base is completely chilled, stir in the lemon juice with pulp and remaining lemon zest. Re-lid and keep in the refrigerator and allow the base to age overnight. Make the lemon bars. \n7. When you are ready to churn, give the base a stir with a whisk and pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream maker. Freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. \n8. To assemble your Lemon Bar Ice Cream: Remove churned ice cream from the machine into a medium sized bowl. Gently stir in the lemon bar chunks, adding more as you see fit. \n9. Scoop churned ice cream into an airtight container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on (the lid won\u2019t fit if the container is too full). Freeze until the ice cream is firm and flavor is ripened, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nLemon Bars \nYield: 9 x 13 pan \n\nFor the crust: \n6 oz (170g) salted butter, melted\n\u2153 cup + 2 tbsp (90g) white sugar\n\u00bd tsp (2.6g) salt\n1 tsp (4.4g) vanilla extract \n1 \u00bd cup (192g) flour \n\nFor the Lemon Filling:\n6 (300g) eggs \n2 1/4 cup (450g) white sugar \n1 \u00bc cup 287g) fresh lemon juice \n\u00be tsp lemon extract \n\u00be cup + 1 tbsp (102g) flour, sifted\n\n\u00be cup powdered sugar, sifted, for topping once cooled (optional) \n\n1. Set the oven to 350F degrees. Lightly grease your baking pan with shortening and line with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium sized pot, gently melt the butter over low heat. Once the butter is melted, remove from the heat and stir in sugar, salt and vanilla extract. Continue to stir the mixture for 1 minute to bring down the temperature slightly.\n3. Add the flour to the sugar/butter mixture and mix well, until it forms a soft dough.\nTransfer the dough to the prepared pan and gently work the dough into a thin, even layer.* The dough will appear greasy - this is perfect. The secret to working with the dough is to be gentle and to work between using your fingers and your palms to push it into place. You will find that it can be manipulated easily. \n4. Bake the crust for 20 -25 minutes. When the crust is done, it will be a golden brown color. \n5. While the crust is baking, make the filling. Whisk together the eggs and sugar. \nGently mix in the lemon juice and lemon extract.\n6. Sift the flour into the mixture and whisk vigorously until fully combined.\n7. Lastly, strain the lemon mixture through a sieve to thin out any lumps. You can press any remaining flour bits through the strainer, into the mixture. \n8. Once the crust has finished baking, pour the lemon mixture over the hot crust and return to the oven. Bake for an additional 20-25 minutes. This time varies, so begin with 20 minutes and add time as needed. Bake until the center is set and does not wiggle when moved. \n9. Let cool to room temperature. Cover with foil and refrigerate until ready to chop and add small squares to churned ice cream. If you are topping with sifted powdered sugar, do so now. Enjoy the remaining lemon bars with a cup of tea or alongside a scoop of lemon bar or vanilla ice cream\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrlh4v", "created_utc": 1743797604.0, "score": 469, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1jrlh4v/finally_my_lemon_bar_ice_cream_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to you all make coffee ice cream?", "selftext": "Hi creamy people\n\nAt my job i took over Ice cream making about 2 years ago and have mostly been following the recipes from my predecesor, which included a coffee recipe that called for Instant Coffee and Artificial Flavoring.\n\nAfter trying a vietnamese coffee ice cream that is prepared by brewing the actual ice cream base i saw how completely gamechanging this is and how the flavor was so full and rich. I experimented at my own store this week by brewing the vanilla base we get (10qts) with 1 lb of beans and tried two batches one with unground one with ground beans. Brought the base with the beans/grounds in it up to 120F in a pot on an induction stove, set the stove to 160 and had it stay on heat for 2 hours. Refigerate beans-in overnight and used next day.\n\nI was so excited that the FLAVOR was incredible. HOWEVER i was straining the grinds batch for over an hour! I lost about 25% of the base to straining and could not seem to get the grinds out. Looking into it I need to get either a brew bag or use a cheesecloth so i come here for advice on which method to use. Should i crush the beans instead of grinding them? Would it still need brew bag/cheesecloth?\n\nBTW the unground batch was very deep and smooth, less acidic. Needed some instant coffee for punch though it was the base for pic #3 Mocha Cookie Fudge. \n\nGrinds batch after straining did have the grinds affect mouthfeel so i called it \"Artisanal Coffee\" so i turned it into an upside lol. This batch had more acidity and completely powerful flavor which i loved as a coffee addict. Feels like an espresso shot to the soul. \n\nPic 1: artisanal coffee, 2: strain #5, 3: mocha cookie fudge\n\nNot sure if i should give out my location and store name but would love some input :)\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k81od4", "created_utc": 1745631885.0, "score": 233, "author": "Marth_Main", "num_comments": 81, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1k81od4/how_to_you_all_make_coffee_ice_cream/", "html_title": ""}

I also only had one egg on hand, so this batch only has one yolk. I\u2019m sure it would be just as delicious egg-free as well. \n\nTake good care all! \n\nYield: about 1.5 quarts\n\n1 \u00be cup (weigh) whole milk\n1 \u00bc cup (298g) heavy cream\n\u00bc cup (33g) nonfat dry milk powder\n\u2154 cup (134g) white sugar\n\u00bc tsp (1.3g) salt\n1 Tbsp + 1 tsp (5.3g) Mt. Hagen instant coffee, regular or decaffeinated\n3 (54g) egg yolks\n\u00bc tsp (1.1g) good quality vanilla extract\n\nBefore starting, set aside a medium sized bowl (one with a lid) with a fine mesh strainer on top. \n\n1. In a medium-sized heavy bottom saucepan, add the whole milk, heavy cream, nonfat dry milk powder, sugar, salt and instant coffee. Heat over low to medium heat, gently bringing the mixture up to a low simmer. Simmer for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously until all ingredients are incorporated.\n2. While the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and put the yolks in a small bowl. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\n3. Once the milk mixture is combined and all the ingredients are incorporated, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn the heat to medium. \n4. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, registering about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer. This will take about 5 to 7 minutes. \n5. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer into the bowl you set aside. Allow the base to cool at room temperature for an hour. \nStir in the vanilla extract. \n6. Add the lid to the bowl and set in the refrigerator to age overnight.\n7. When you are ready to churn, give the base a stir with a whisk and pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream maker. Freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. \n8. Place churned ice cream in an airtight container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm and flavor is ripened, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ioxwir", "created_utc": 1739492579.0, "score": 226, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1ioxwir/i_made_coffee_oreo_ice_cream_for_my_partner_for/", "html_title": ""}

Then I heated up 380g milk & 50g glucose til it was steaming, and used that to temper 100g quail egg yolks (you can use yolks of your choice, I only used quail to create intrigue for my brother who likes things to be ridiculous!). Bring the tempered custard mixture to 165g, then let cool to room temp. Once at room temp, I combined it with the previous mixture (also room temp/ below) with immersion blender. Let cool in fridge overnight.\n\nFor the cherry swirl, I took about 200g frozen dark cherries, broke them down over medium heat til bubbling, transferred to blender, but let cool for a bit first. I then blended, but left SLIGHTLY unsmooth because I wanted a bit of texture. Then combined this with 25g glucose & 25g sugar over medium heat just til everything was dissolved / combined. Let cool in a squeeze bottle in fridge overnight. \n\nFor Cherry chunks, I eyeballed a handful of frozen dark cherries (let them thaw out) threw those in a jar w/ a little bit of vanilla, brown sugar, rum and water. Shook it all up and let soak for a day in fridge. \n\nTo assemble:\nSqueeze some ripple all over sides and bottom of whatever container you're going to store ice cream in. Start churning your ice cream. While churning take out rum soaked cherries and chop into chunk size of choice! During last minute or 2 of churning, toss cherry chunks into ice cream machine. When ice cream is ready to scoop into container, scoop a bit in, layer with squeezes of ripple, and repeat like this til container is full. Top with another squeeze of ripple.

Decent pickup for anyone interested in making homemade ice cream, but some quirks and limitations hold it back. **4/5**.\n\nPros:\n\n* Reliably and easily makes delicious ice cream\n* FAST: Probably its biggest selling point over other home made ice cream machines, it makes ice cream in just 2 minutes(excluding pre-freeze time) instead of 20-40. Which also means it has great...\n* Throughput: The Ninja Creami can feasibly make 4 gallons of ice cream an hour, *provided you have all supplies already frozen*.\n* Cleanup: Almost all parts that can conceivably get dirty are dishwasher safe.\n* *Probably* handles sugar-free ice cream and sorbets better than other options, due to how it operates. See more discussion below. I say probably partly because I haven't tried those options from other home-made machines\n\nCons:\n\n* LOUD: Easily its biggest drawback. This thing make a lot of noise. We actually don't keep ours in the kitchen, we use it in a back room which can be closed off. I mean, the thing is basically blender, made by a company not known for making quiet blenders.\n* Requires that you know ahead of time what ice cream you're going to want the next day (or two), so limits spontaneity with what sort of ice cream flavour you want.\n\nNeither here nor there:\n\n* Price: At ~$200 (can get on sale for less), this thing ain't cheap, and is about double the cost of bowl-in-freezer. It also about half the cost of compressor-style ice cream machines, so it occupies a pleasant middle ground.\n* Counter/cupboard space. It takes up a good chunk of space, about the same as a drip coffee machine, but again, notably less than both bowl-in-freezer and especially compressor models. While the footprint is reasonable, it is quite tall.\n* Consumes freezer space, but quite a bit less per batch than a bowl-in-freezer machine.\n\nQuibbles:\n\n* No transparency on what the individual settings actually do. What's the difference between the 'Gelato' setting and 'Ice Cream' setting? Is it speed? Duration?\n* Cord is a bit short\n* The lids for the pint jars aren't well-made. They don't fit great or form a tight seal.\n* The pint jars don't nest, so even empty in your cupboards, they will consume fair space. Probably no way to make that work with this design, mind you.\n* The recipe book lacks guidance on making your own recipes or how the ingredients work together. Can I replace cream cheese with Xantham gum, for instance? And if you're unlucky enough to get a 'metric' book, watch out! An awful mishmash of units awaits you. Half the ingredients are by weight, half by volume, and half are imperial. Some recipes contains quantities in grams, mL, AND teaspoons. I love the metric system, but this is a joke. But you'll find you quickly move away from following these recipes anyway.\n* Name is kinda dumb. 'Creami' - is it pronounced 'cream-eye' or 'creamy'? And just, why?\n\nDiscussion:\n\nSo my wife and I had been tempted for a long while to start making some home-made ice cream, allowing us to explore new flavours and just have fun. Also, as an early-stage diabetic, I was looking to cut my sugar intake, and sugar-free ice cream pickings are quite sad and/or pricey. Since we were just starting out, we didn't want to spend a ton of money on our first machine until we knew we were into it, but we also didn't have a lot of freezer space to spare for a cheaper bowl-in-freezer style ice cream maker.\n\nSo when we saw the Ninja Creami featured on Sorted Food, we were deeply intrigued. $200 is still a serious outlay for a new hobby we may not even enjoy, but we talked ourselves into it when we spotted it on sale for 20% off.\n\nKnowledgeable ice cream lovers would might out that the Ninja Creami is just a downgraded Pacojet, and they'd be absolutely right. The Creami follows a trend of taking high-end commercial appliances and techniques and making them available for home users, such as sous-vide or combi ovens.\n\nThe principle of operation is pretty straight-forward. Instead of making ice cream the traditional way, by gradually freezing sugary liquid while churning it, the Creami acts as a sort of pulverizer. It takes already-frozen liquid and basically blends it very very finely, producing surprisingly creamy results. \n\nAnd the results have not been disappointing. While there have been some misses, those have generally come from inadequately frozen ingredients yielding overly soft results. A cold freezer is essential, and if you try to make ice cream at just the wrong time, in the middle of a defrost cycle, well, I hope you like soft-serve, or even milkshakes, in the worst case. Or if your freezer is at the limit of acceptable temperature ranges, you might find the 24h recommended freeze time a bit short. Not really the fault of the Creami, I suppose, but a gotcha to be aware of.\n\nBut overall we've been enjoying some really top-notch ice cream made to order. As I mentioned, I am mildly diabetic, so part of our experiments have been with sugar-free or low-sugar options. Even using appropriate substitutes like Allulose, sugar-free options aren't *quite* as satisfying as the classic full-sugar options; they generally turn out pretty soft with slightly more noticeable ice crystals. And since Allulose can be expensive and hard-to-find, we've had better success doing half-sugar, half-substitute options. On the plus side, I suspect that because of how the Creami operates, by pulverizing already frozen liquid, it can still produce good results even without adequate sugar to inhibit ice crystal formation, at least compared to traditional churning. I can't prove that, though, as I have nothing to compare against.\n\nNinja's recipes make extensive use of warmed and softened cream cheese as an emulsifier, to which you cream in the sugar manually, but I find that to be a bit of a pain, so we've been omitting that step when in a hurry to get our pints in the freezer, and while it makes a difference, the result is still pretty good. We're experimenting using Xantham gum instead, but it's too early to say if that's a suitable substitute.\n\nWhile the ice cream is good, the gelato has been out-of-this-world. Perhaps its because the egg yolks are a better emulsifier, but the gelato produced by the Creami is second to none. As rich and creamy as you'll find at any Gelatinery. An orange saffron gelato served alongside triple chocolate has probably been our most phenomenal creation yet. The gelato is a bit more work than straight ice cream, of course, but is definitely worth it. Plus you can batch it well enough. Get yourself a few extra pint jars and stock up for the week.\n\nBut its perhaps the sorbets that impressed me the most. Not because they're better than gelato or ice cream, they're not, but because of the high result to effort ratio that goes into making them. Prep is literally just opening a can and dumping it into the container, then freezing it. That's it. And the end result is shockingly smooth, creamy and delicious. And cheap and healthy-ish, too. We've just started experimenting with sherbets, but so far they seem to be a step up from standard sorbet; I prefer them.\n\nCleanup is a snap, provided you have a dishwasher. Everything can go in. The only part that needs manual cleaning is the spindle on the machine, where it connects to the blades (sorry, hard to describe). And all it needs is a quick wipe with a damp cloth. The weird nobbles on the bottom of the pint jars is hard to get the ice cream out of, so you can expect to leave some behind because of that.\n\nIt's not all rainbows and unicorns, of course. There are a number of sore spots with the machine, most of which I detail in the Pros/Cons/Quibbles above, and generally speak for themselves.\n\nSome of the provided recipes are more than a little disappointing. The pistachio ice cream got my wife excited, as its one of her favourite flavours. But it tries to use almond extract to simulate pistachio flavour, and while it's kinda close, it was ultimately a let down. The recipe for chocolate hazelnut similarly tries to use Nutella to capture that flavour; it didn't work. There is apparently an extended recipe book available from Ninja for ~$15. I haven't looked into it, it should really just come with the machine, though. But since we're interested in colouring outside the lines more (looking forward to cucumber ice cream!), we don't miss it that much.\n\nSometimes a single go through the Creami isn't enough to adequately cream-ify the ice cream, especially if your freezer is too cold, or you're making something that's low sugar, producing something that looks crumbly or chalky, but there's a handy 're-spin' function just for that. Not a big deal, but annoying if you have to re-do it two or three times. Sometimes no amount of respinning can seem to make it come together completely, but while the result is less creamy, it's generally still pretty good, and a few minutes of warming up generally gets it the rest of the way.\n\nIt does only make a pint at a time, which is perfect for my wife and me, but for larger audiences, you'll want to do multiple pints in a go. At least its only a few minutes per pint.\n\nOn the rare occasion that there's leftovers, we've found that up to a day afterward, they usually can be eaten straight out of the freezer; longer than that they generally need a re-spin or two to get back to ideal consistency.\n\nIn conclusion, we've been quite happy with our purchase so far. While not perfect, it's a great and reasonably affordable machine for anyone looking to get into the hobby of home-made ice cream.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/w224ef/my_experience_with_the_ninja_creami_with_tldr/", "created_utc": 1658157995.0, "score": 162, "author": "rexstuff1", "num_comments": 78, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/w224ef/my_experience_with_the_ninja_creami_with_tldr/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Ninja Creami - First Impressions Review", "selftext": "Hey /r/icecreamery, I've seen some buzz around the Ninja Creami around this sub, but didn't see a lot of first hand accounts of it. I ended up buying one from Canadian Tire for $200 (they list for $250 but price match locally).\n\nA bit of background on me; I've been a chef for 15 years and though I haven't specialized in pastry, I have written a good amount of dessert menus many that centred around gelatos/sorbets/ice creams. My experience is more with commercial machines, I was fortunate enough to play with a Pacojet, soft-serve machines and some compressor churners.\n\n**THE CREAMI!**\n\nThe machine design is based closely on the infamous Pacojet, you prepare your base, fill the canister, freeze until completely solid then process in the machine. Batches take about 2-3min to process the first time around, I found that more often than not they would require a re-spin (another 1.5 min), most batches were done in under 5 min. I tested a bunch of different types of recipes, egg based custard, gelato, frozen yogurt, fruit sorbets, sugar-free-non-dairy-frozen-treats. The canisters hold about 500ml, there are 3 in the box and early units ship with a redeemable coupon for 2 additional containers, you can also buy more for $20-$40 for a 2 pack.\n\n\n**THE GOOD!**\n\nThe Creami does a really good job at blasting through frozen bases, even products with lower sugar and fat content were processed with little issue. Products came out smooth, though sometimes they required re-spins. Out of a dozen batches, there were only two batches that needed to be melted and re-frozen after an adjustment. One of the really impressive things I found was that you can just freeze canned fruit then spin it to get some low effort sorbet, I tested cans of peach slices and cans of pineapple chunks and both were surprisingly good. I was also impressed by it's ability to process low fat and keto recipes, though denser, the batches came out smooth and better than store bought alternatives.  \n\n**THE BAD!**\n\nOne of the biggest weaknesses of this machine is storing any leftovers, most of the batches that I put back in the freezer were rock hard within a few hours. I find this very limiting for things like ice cream with ribbons or swirls in them, for example if you fold and layer ribbons of chocolate into a vanilla base, you can't really store it in the freezer or you'll have to re-spin the base thus destroying all the ribbons you worked hard for. This could also cause problems if you are looking to serve over 1L of ice cream to for a party, it would be difficult to churn and store a large amount of ice cream without it getting very hard, you could churn the bases right before serving them but this thing is LOUD. It will probably be the loudest appliance in your kitchen, at 4ft away it's unpleasant, this can be an issue depending on your tolerance for loud noises. The manufacturing tolerance for the canisters and blade is not very tight, there is a 2-3mm gap of frozen product that doesn't get processed by regular cycles (probably accounts for 10% of overall product left unprocessed). I found the only real fix for this is to scoop the contents into a new canister to be refrozen and reprocessed, or to just live with the 10% of unprocessed product.\n\n**THE NOT BAD, BUT NOT GOOD**\n\nThe way the Creami works kind of limits what kind of results you can get from it. Overrun is kind of restricted to 5%-20% and I found the style of product only fell into a narrow band, everything kind of came out as a medium dense gelato type product. The super fluffy American style of ice cream was difficult to achieve and on the other end of the spectrum the refreshing fruit sorbets with a hint of crunch (like Italian ice) were also not possible. Everything came out as a smooth, semi whipped, semi dense product, very gelato like. This limitation is cause by the way it processes ice cream, it doesn't really \"churn\" your base as much as it pulverizes the ice crystals to a point where they're not detectable by your tongue. \n\n**TARGET MARKET**\n\nI think this appliance has appeal to a few different camps of people. People that want half decent homemade ice cream without a lot of work will find a lot of value. People that really love the denser consistency of gelato and are willing to look past the other limitations will find a lot of value. People that want fluffy, layered, American style ice cream will be disappointed. People that want the convenience of just grabbing a quick spoonful of ice cream without spinning the entire batch - will be left disappointed. Couples, small families and people that want to make easy keto or low fat/sugar ice cream - will find a lot of value.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI really really like the Ninja Creami, I don't mind the quirks and can work with the limitations of the technology. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but with some adjustments you can get some really fantastic results. I also don't know if it will stand the test of time (even Pacojets run into maintenance issues often). It has some quirks and limitations, BUT I think it's a fantastic addition to the market. This kind of product hasn't really existed at this price point and this niche market could really use more competition. I'm hoping that since this is only the first generation we will see design improvements down the road.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/sdhriy/ninja_creami_first_impressions_review/", "created_utc": 1643234650.0, "score": 119, "author": "Craigenstein", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/sdhriy/ninja_creami_first_impressions_review/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Heat over low to medium heat, gently bringing the mixture up to a low simmer. Simmer for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously until all ingredients are dissolved.\nWhile the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and put the yolks in a small bowl. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\nOnce all the ingredients are incorporated into the dairy, slowly add the egg yolks into the mixture, stirring continuously so the yolks incorporate fully. Turn the heat to medium. \nContinue to cook, stirring vigorously, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, registering about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer. This will take 5 to 7 minutes.\nImmediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer into the bowl you set aside. Allow the base to cool to room temperature. Stir in the vanilla extract. \nAdd the lid to the bowl and set in the refrigerator to age overnight.\nWhen you are ready to churn, pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. \nTo assemble your Cookies N Cream Ice Cream: Once churned, scoop your ice cream into a medium sized bowl and stir in your Oreos.\nPlace ice cream in an airtight container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm and flavor is ripened, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\n*added nostalgia, pulverize an additional 3-4 Oreos in a food processor until they become Oreo dust. Stir this cookie dust into the churned ice cream before you mix in the larger pieces. If you allow the flavors to meld overnight, your cookies n cream will taste just as it did when you were a kid, if not a million times better! \n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/7ycsf8841yyd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1730751605.0, "score": 115, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1gjo52x/loaded_cookie_n_cream/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Dubai  Chocolate Bar Ice Cream", "selftext": "My wife tried to make her own Dubai chocolate bar, and I wanted to make an ice cream with the leftovers. If you don\u2019t know the bar is chocolate filled with a mixture of pistachio cream, tahini, and fried kataifi. Kataifi is really thin shreds of dough that when fried get really crispy and give an awesome texture to the bar. I was hoping to preserve that in the ice cream so I mixed the kataifi with the pistachio cream to waterproof it, and mixed it in like a ripple. I also used stracciatella style chocolate threads to encourage crispy. There\u2019s pistachio cream and tahini in the base. Usually you would use pistachio paste and that may have given a more intense flavor since that was lacking a bit. \n\nAfter two days the kataifi was still crispy though it softened slightly. Overall I was really happy with it. I think this could be a cool way to add crispy crunchies to other ice creams. You could put them peanut butter, chocolate, or maybe a caramel.

Poppy seeds mixed in are great. I found the first one was a little too sweet so I started adjusting the recipe. I find it could use slightly more beet puree and slightly less sugar, and a LOT more orange zest. Beautiful color.\n\n**Grapefruit hibiscus frozen yogurt** pg 178 Flavor will depend a LOT on your choice of grapefruit! Beautiful purple color from the hibiscus. Excellent mouthfeel--this is one of the few tart flavor recipes I made that didn\u2019t end up with milk fat globules in the final product.\n\n**Influenza Rx Sorbet** pg 180 An excellent sorbet. Aside from the honey, this recipe is vegan. Do not try to use universal pectin...it has to be liquid pectin (learn from my mistake). Better without the optional alcohol. (Note to self, try making other flavored sorbets with liquid pectin? Seems like a good idea...)\n\n**Star anise ice cream with candied fennel seeds**  pg 107 Excellent flavor from just the steeped whole anise (no extract called for, nor is it needed!). The candied fennel adds a delightful crunch and beautiful colors. I forgot the cream cheese and salt as specified in the recipe but it still turned out excellent.\n\n**Backyard mint ice cream** pg 72 You can let the peppermint steep for much longer than the recommended 4-12 hours, and/or use a lot of it. Unlikely to have the flavor end up too strong. The flavor benefits from adding in some dark chocolate freckles in the final mix (double boiler, add melted chocolate at the last stage of churning).\n\n**Goat cheese ice cream with roasted red cherries** pg 68 Tastes like cheesecake. Very pretty. Can use frozen (not thawed) cherries which is convenient.\n\n*Good/OK*:\n\n**Bangkok peanut ice cream** pg 166 A unique mouthfeel. The peanut butter and coconut contribute to the mouthfeel as well as the flavor, and it feels dense and creamy.\n\n**Oakvale Young Gouda ice cream with vodka-plumped Cranberries** pg 118 I wasn\u2019t totally successful--I was not able to find any young Gouda cheese at the store. If you substitute cheeses, you must know your cheese...I tried to find a good semi-soft alternative cheese but failed (I chose a semi-soft Swiss...). Many cheeses will not work because they will not incorporate fully into the mixture. The cranberries are excellent.\n\n**Roasted Pistachio ice cream** pg 40 I struggled to achieve the smooth pistachio paste with the food processor, but I probably just needed to run it a lot longer. In any case, a good pistachio ice cream.\n\n**Lemon frozen yogurt** pg 46 A very nice mild lemon frozen yogurt with a good mouthfeel.\n\n**The Buckeye State Ice Cream** pg 104 A very traditional flavor combo (peanut butter, honey, chocolate). Felt professional, but not artisanal, compared to the other flavors I like to make.\n\n**Sweet potato ice cream** pg 126 I made this with Japanese purple yams. The yam skin is purple but the yams are not. So the color is brown (from the molasses). This ice cream is very thick. I found it coats the tongue with what seemed to be milk fat globules at first glance, but they did not melt with heat, so I think they are related to the starch somehow. Very \u201cThanksgiving.\u201d I skipped the marshmallows.\n\n**The milkiest chocolate ice cream** 156 Very similar to the other chocolate flavors in this book. A good chocolate ice cream.\n\n**Queen city cayenne ice cream** pg 160 For those who like spicy, chocolate with a mild kick of cayenne is an excellent flavor. Before freezing overnight, the churned ice cream was almost slimy? After some time in the freezer it became a ganache-like mouthfeel.\n\n**Roasted Strawberry and buttermilk ice cream** pg 31 The puree makes enough for two batches. A nice mild flavor, but the acidity caused some milk fat globules in the final product.\n\n\\----------------\n\nSalt and Straw\n\n*The Best:*\n\n**Meyer lemon blueberry buttermilk custard** pg 133 Excellent very fluffy mouthfeel that maintained fluffiness for a long time in the freezer. I used premade jam with lemon juice as suggested in the book as an alternative to making fresh jam, but the jam I used ended up slightly icy and needed a touch more sugar.\n\n**Goat cheese Marionberry habanero** pg 138 An excellent flavor if you like spicy ice cream.\n\n**Grand poppy seed sherbet** pg 123 With lemon marshmallow fluff. Really good! For the liqueurs I just pick whatever I have in my cabinet that seems appropriate rather than go to the store to get some speciality item. I think I had something with lemon flavored liqueur on hand at the time.\n\n*Good/OK:*\n\n**Sea salt with caramel ribbons** pg 68 Good but needs something--on its own it was missing a depth of flavor. We added a toasted pistachio brittle. Toasted nuts definitely will help.\n\n**Roasted strawberry and toasted white chocolate** pg 87 Pretty good. Not too memorable. Maybe I\u2019m not a fan of white chocolate, but this one just tastes sweet to me (and I find that boring).\n\n**Vegan salted caramel bars and coconut cream** pg 91 Surprisingly rich and overall very good. Strong coconut flavors. The vegan banana bread (the bars, sans caramel) are excellent and not overpowering. Caramel is a little overpowering. I recommend more banana bread and less caramel.\n\n**Honey lavender** pg 119 Strong lavender flavor will indeed put some off. There's an aftertaste to the lavender. Cutting it with something, like chocolate, helps. Not too much though or it will overwhelm. Thinking--a light ganache? Caramel? Lemon meringue?\n\n*Not good:*\n\n**Roasted parsnip & banana sorbet** pg 157 The parsnip didn't bake nearly fast enough compared to the banana. The fiber is a problem unless cooked and blended really well, and maybe could be strained out. We pureed it in the blender and then cooked it much longer on the stovetop. The mouthfeel and flavors are like apple sauce, but pretty bland.\n\n**Pear and blue cheese** pg 81 A little icy when we made it. Process of making the pear takes a long time and seems wasteful with all the pear-sugar-water that is not needed. Needs more pears than the recipe calls for. The blue cheese was a tiny bit icy.\n\n\\----------------------------\n\nThe Perfect Scoop\n\n*The Best:*\n\n**Chocolate** pg 30 Really nice. I made it once with black cocoa instead of regular cocoa and it was also very good (distinct color and somewhat different flavor). Smooth, rich, deep chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is like ganache.\n\n**Vietnamese coffee ice cream** pg 39 Made with decaf espresso (pods). Very good coffee ice cream. I personally found it a touch too sweet, but my significant other really liked it.\n\n**Green tea ice cream** pg 40 A tiny bit sweeter than I like it. Color is nice. Mouthfeel is nice. Goes very well with red bean paste (I cooked them down more than the recipe called for, by mistake, so it became a paste without any whole beans left).\n\n**Cinnamon ice cream** pg 45 Really really good. Great mouth feel and great flavor. Starts like cinnamon toast crunch and ends like red hots.\n\nGood/OK:\n\n**Blueberry frozen yogurt** pg 92 It's fine but just boring. Maybe blueberries without a lot of lemon are boring. Just felt sweet. Straining the fruit was a pain.\n\n**Super lemon ice cream** pg 93 Flavor is very good and complex with the lemon zest. But like many acidic/tart flavors I\u2019ve tried making, there were globules of milk fat causing a very fatty mouthfeel in the final product. If that can be fixed this would be an excellent flavor.\n\n**Fresh ginger Ice cream** pg 43 Ginger flavor is not nearly strong enough. Otherwise fine.\n\n**Peanut butter ice cream.** pg 59 We made it with JIF smooth not-at-all natural PB and the flavor is exactly Reese's Pieces. The flavor is strong and the mouth feel is\u2026 whipped? Lots of air. Homemade feel to it. Mouthfeel ok, not at all grainy, slight fatty mouth coating after. Probably needs to be done with a different peanut butter (some all-natural kind?) I bet it would be much better that way.\n\n*Not Good:*\n\n**Banana sorbet** pg 142 A good lighter and refreshing option, but quite forgettable. Pales in comparison with more premium ice creams and is overpowered by any strong flavored mix-ins.\n\n**Chocolate tangerine sorbet** pg 125 Chocolate ends up a little grainy. Terrible mouthfeel. Chocolate managed to clash with tangerine a little bit (though chocolate/orange is generally a great flavor combo). Would not attempt again.\n\n**Mocha sherbet** pg 126 Shortly after beginning the churn it appears somewhat grainy. I suppose this is to be expected with sherbet.  Flavor is more chocolatey than coffee. Could use a stronger brew. Not too impressed.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHello My Name Is Ice Cream\n\n*The Best:*\n\n**Peach jalope\u00f1o Frozen Yogurt** pg 132 Really nice concept, but needed some changes. Following the instructions I ended up with ice cream that is too spicy for anyone who isn't super into spicy food like me. Peach was far too subtle and should be concentrated by further boiling down the peach mash. Jalope\u00f1o should be reduced and this will depend a lot on the jalapeno you get... Otherwise absolutely an excellent flavor for those who like spicy ice cream.\n\n**Milk chocolate frozen yogurt** pg 124 Really interesting mouthfeel. Stretchy, perhaps gummy. Machine started to stall when the frozen yogurt was still very shiny and wet looking, so I had to pull it then. Nothing like the usual texture--no overrun, not at all airy, no cracking or fluffiness--just dense and gooey! After it went into the freezer overnight it was good though still unique in terms of mouthfeel. Flavor is amazing. Greek yogurt tanginess and milk chocolate sweetness.\n\n**Ginger frozen yogurt** pg 120 Really good flavor. I put a bit more ginger in than the recipe called for. A winning flavor. Smooth mouthfeel. Not for those who don't like a strong, spicy ginger flavor.\n\n**Green cardamom** pg 64 I felt it wasn\u2019t strong enough and steeped it for much longer than the recipe called for. Then it was way too strong! So I made 2 batches plain and mixed with the one strong batch. Many who tried it loved it and counted it among their favorites. Cardamom tastes like Fruit Loops, it turns out...\n\n**Danish licorice** pg 70 Nice, very strong flavor. If you like licorice, anise, and fennel this is a good one\n\n*Good/OK:*\n\n**Burnt honey** pg 62 Kind of mild. Could use another flavor to add complexity.\n\n**Strawberry Sherbet** pg 112 Goes well with milk chocolate freckles added in. Straining the strawberries is a pain. Good ice cream.\n\n**Meyer lemon frozen yogurt** pg 123 Same exact problem as with most acidic flavors. Butter comes out in tiny fat globules, ruining texture. If you can fix that, this is an OK flavor.\n\n**Hibiscus frozen yogurt** \ud83c\udf3a pg 127 Good, but slightly fatty mouthfeel (again, tart flavors causing milk fat globules problem). After fully frozen, pretty dense/hard. Flavor is nice tart hibiscus. I like the complexity of Jeni's grapefruit and hibiscus much better than this plain hibiscus flavor.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\nBooks from which I\u2019ve only made one or two recipes so far:\n\nAmple Hills\n\n**Dark Chocolate**, pg. 36. Pretty good but nothing amazing. Not my favorite chocolate recipe.\n\nLello musso manual\n\n**Honey lemon sorbet** Grainy. Honey flavor is nice. Would be nice on a hot day I guess. But doubt I\u2019ll make it again. Note: I made it with only 1 cup water instead of 2. My mistake. Didn\u2019t freeze right.\n\nSweet Cream and Sugar Cones\n\n**Caramelized banana ice cream** pg 202 All-time favorite. I like to add more of the caramelized banana than the recipe calls for (about 1.5 times what it calls for).  I recommend you mix with salted chocolate ganache (put into the machine and churn for a few revolutions). Amazing! I should really try other recipes from this book, given how good this one was....\n\nMexican Ice Cream by Fany Gerson\n\n**White Corn** pg 87 Great fragrance. Great flavor. But whole kernels seem ever so slightly icy. I think either blend the whole thing or reserve some kernels and cook in sugar water so they don't get icy. I used Sweet Corn and the adjustment (reduced sugar and corn syrup) the recipe suggested for that. I found putting some Lawry's season salt on top (after scooping) was amazing.\n\n**Rose Petal** pg 58 This recipe makes no sense. You blend a mixture of milk, almonds, and rose petals. This creates a fibrous wet mass. Then you strain this with a fine-mesh strainer??? I did my best to extract the liquid with force through a cheesecloth but the process was messy and the yield was low. There has to be a better way. I also did not need 4 oz dried rose petals...I think she must have had fresh rose petals, whereas mine were dried. I used less than half the 4 oz of dried rose petals for the recipe.\n\nFlavor is very good though. Rose with almond is a great concept. It has a chocolate-y taste? I really like it.\n\nNote: It is not easy to source good rose petals (which will be bits, not whole petals, most likely). I purchased two different products on Amazon. One which said \u201cculinary use\u201d in the description but the actual package didn\u2019t have that printed anywhere on it and I don\u2019t trust it, especially after I spent 2 hours sorting out a significant quantity of stems and leaves (and a few bug shells). The other product was labeled clearly and nicely as \u201craw food\u201d and seems much cleaner and better, but still just bits and not whole petals, not that this matters much.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nMy own recipe!\n\nNutella Fro Yo (super easy nearly no-prep recipe. Just make simple syrup ahead of time, which stores forever)\n\n* 500g Fage (2% or higher)\n* 180g Nutella\n* 110g Simple Syrup (make ahead of time and cool. 1:1 sugar to water by volume)\n\nMix by hand until consistent throughout. Churn in machine.So convenient. Nutella richness with tartness from Greek yogurt.

{"title": "Classic Rocky Road \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "selftext": "Is one of my favorites. Luscious chocolate ice cream paired with toasty walnuts and mini marshmallows (pictured here) or homemade marshmallow fluff (recipe included). Happy New Year all! Let me know if you have any questions! \n\nSweet Lo\u2019s Rocky Road\n\nYield: about 1.5 quarts \n\n1 \u00bd cup (357g) heavy cream\n3 tbsp (22.5g) cocoa powder \n\u2154 cup / 5 ounces (142g) semi-sweet + bittersweet chocolate chips*\n1 \u00bd cup (368g) whole milk \n\u00bc cup (33g) nonfat dry milk powder \n\u2154 cup + 1 tbsp (150g) white sugar \n\u00bd tsp (2.6g) salt \n3 (54g) egg yolks\n\u00bc tsp (1.1g) good quality vanilla extract \n\n*I use 3.6oz (102g) semi-sweet chips (43%) + 1.4oz (40g) bittersweet chips (63%). Feel free to adjust these levels to your liking. \n\n3oz (85g) toasted walnuts (recipe below)\n\n1 cup (about 55g) mini marshmallows \n\nAND / OR\n\n 1 \u00bd cups (weigh) homemade marshmallow fluff (recipe below)\n\nBefore starting, set aside a medium sized bowl (one with a lid) with a fine mesh strainer on top.\n\n1. In a medium-sized, heavy bottom saucepan add the heavy cream, cocoa powder and (both) chocolate chips. Heat on medium low, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and the cocoa is incorporated.\n2. Pour this mixture into the medium-sized bowl and set a mesh strainer on top of it.\n3. In the same saucepan (do not clean out!) add the whole milk, nonfat milk powder, sugar and salt. Heat on medium low, stirring occasionally, until the dry ingredients have incorporated into the milk.\n4. While the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and put the yolks in a small bowl. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\n5. Once the milk mixture is combined and all the ingredients are incorporated, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn the heat to medium. \n6. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, registering about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer. This will take about 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer into the heavy cream / chocolate mixture and give a good stir. Allow the base to cool at room temperature for an hour. Stir in the vanilla extract.\n7. Add the lid to the bowl and set in the refrigerator to age overnight.\n8. Toast your walnuts and make your marshmallow fluff, if you are using. \n9. When you are ready to churn, pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.\n10. To assemble your Rocky Road Ice Cream: Scoop your churned chocolate ice cream from the ice cream maker into a medium sized bowl. Quickly stir in your toasted walnuts and mini marshmallows. Scoop into your container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nIf you are using marshmallow fluff: Scoop your churned chocolate ice cream from the ice cream maker into a medium sized bowl. Quickly stir in the toasted walnuts. Next, dollop spoonfuls of it over the chocolate / walnut ice cream and get some of the fluff along with some ice cream on the paddle as you scoop it into your container. Repeat this process, adding more fluff as you go, to your liking. Once complete, cover the container with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nToasted Walnuts \nYield: about \u2154 cup walnuts \n\nPlace \u2154 cup raw walnuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and toast at 350 degrees for 6 minutes. After 6 minutes, take the walnuts out and sprinkle them generously with salt. Give the walnuts a shake, rotate the pan and toast for an additional 3 minutes. When they are toasty and fragrant smelling, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool completely. Give them a rough chop before placing them in a jar until ready to use. \n\nMarshmallow Fluff\nYield: about 1 \u00be cups fluff \n\n3 (126g) egg whites\n\u00be cup (150g) white sugar\n\u00bc tsp (1.1g) cream of tartar\nSplash of vanilla extract \n\nWhisk the egg whites and sugar for 2-3 minutes in a double boiler or a nonreactive bowl set over a small pot of simmering water.\nAs soon as the sugar is fully dissolved into the egg whites and the mixture is warm, transfer to a bowl of a stand mixer.\nWhisk on medium high speed for about 2 minutes, then add in the cream of tartar and splash of vanilla extract, just when the egg whites are turning from translucent to opaque. \nContinue whisking for an additional 5-7 minutes, making a thick, stiff marshmallow fluff. \nTransfer marshmallow fluff to a jar with a lid and keep at room temperature until ready to use, up to two weeks. \nGet ready to dollop spoonfuls of fluff into your churned chocolate + walnut ice cream. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y5sic0n62p9e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1735437330.0, "score": 106, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1holazg/classic_rocky_road/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "So we made gelato in the car while driving to a friend's housewarming the other day...", "selftext": "Long story short - wife and I had a friend's housewarming to go to and I suggested bringing a homemade frozen treat because we have the ice cream maker and it would be a nice novelty. The problem is that the friend's housewarming is an hour away and we would have to drop off our toddler at my in-laws house which is half way. \n\nThe question became how would we make it. We weren't sure how long the ice cream would last (even with ice packs and insulation in a cold bag) and my wife was leery about dry ice in the SUV. So I suggested making it in the car on the way (using the 110V outlet in the SUV). \n\n* In laws were over on Thursday and took the freezer bowl home with them (they probably thought the plan was over the top but they didn't object)\n* Once we dropped off the toddler at the in-laws on Saturday, we poured the mix into the freezer bowl and started the machine and drove away. We made gelato because we didn't have to worry about it melting too fast. My wife sat in the back and had the machine between her legs.\n* I will say that if you ever make gelato in a car, it's rather loud although not as loud as the ice cream which needs to spin faster = louder. My wife probably could have used ear plugs but she was a good sport about it. \n* We stopped in a grocery parking lot 5 minutes away to scoop the gelato out into a container. We probably looked a bit weird but it was in a town where we didn't know anyone. We left the dirty machine in the car to wash after. \n* We show up with the gelato and people liked it and nobody really asked how we made it (which my wife was nervous on because it's somewhat of a ridiculous process). The housewarming friend liked the idea of making his own treats that he bought a Breville compressor one on the spot while we were chatting (it was an alcohol influenced purchase).\n\nI don't foresee us making ice cream/gelato in the car again but you never know.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/u0zs99/so_we_made_gelato_in_the_car_while_driving_to_a/", "created_utc": 1649652870.0, "score": 102, "author": "RivetCounter", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/u0zs99/so_we_made_gelato_in_the_car_while_driving_to_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Olive oil, vanilla and bay leaf ice cream - a delicious and mostly successful experiment", "selftext": "This is a follow-up to my previous post asking for advice and input on making olive oil ice cream, so thank you to those who made helpful comments.\n\nI'll write some notes about what I did, and then I'll write a recipe which reflects what I would do next time. Skip to the recipe if you have no interest in the experimentation process.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe first step was I took my 100g of extra virgin olive oil (decent quality stuff, nice grassy/herbal flavour, but not fruity/floral like I should do in future) and I put five dried bay leaves in it and heated for about 15 minutes at between 60 and 80\u00b0C to infuse the flavour. I tasted the oil afterwards and frankly I don't think this worked! Possibly the bay leaves I've grown are just not that strong, or the olive oil flavour is too strong.\n\nThe base was heated with three more bay leaves and one vanilla pod with all seeds scraped into the mix. I tasted this after it had been brought up to 84\u00b0C and was cooling down again, and it tasted delicious. Predominantly vanilla, but the bay leaf was also there backing it up. Nice combination.\n\nThe next tasting point was after the olive oil had been added and churning was just completed. (This took longer than the usual 30 minutes to get to soft serve stage which seemed like a bad sign). I think tasting at this point is the moment you know whether you've got something magic, and in this case, yes I did. I was genuinely surprised, I think I said \"Oh!\" out loud. Also, could I taste the bay leaves anymore? Not sure!\n\nThe final tasting point was after it had been in a container for several hours to freeze statically, and I have to say when I tasted it straight out of the freezer it was great, but it didn't quite have the same wow factor any more... Perhaps the fact it wasn't my first impression didn't help, but anyway this led me to decide that I should aim for a higher scooping temperature so that it would be warmer upon consumption, and therefore hopefully the flavour would be more 'available' so to speak, to the taste buds. This of course means that it won't be so scoopable straight out of the freezer and might need ten minutes in the fridge before serving. The side benefit is that less sugar might mask the flavours less? And perhaps I should try to decrease the sugars even more...\n\n\nRECIPE\n\nI'm definitely onto something with this one!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n500g whole milk (~3.5% fat)\n100g heavy cream (36% fat)\n50g skim milk powder\n130g sucrose\n100g olive oil\n54g egg yolk (= 3 large egg yolks for me)\n1/8tsp xanthan gum, level\n1/8tsp guar gum, rounded (Use your preferred stabiliser/s. I like these because they have synergy)\n1/4tsp salt (~1.4g)\n7 to 10 bay leaves (I have access to a tree with plenty of leaves. If bay leaves are expensive for you, you could just omit these. Bay is not the main flavour)\n1 vanilla bean. Scrape the seeds and cut into pieces with scissors when adding to base.\n\nMETHOD\n1. Add all dry ingredients to a bowl and mix well to disperse stabilisers.\n2. Add milk cream, eggs, bay leaves and vanilla to a pot and whisk thoroughly.\n3. Slowly and gently heat the mixture, whisking continuously and tracking it with a thermometer.\n4. When it's above 40\u00b0C whisk in the dry ingredients.\n5. Continue slowly heating and whisking until it reaches 84\u00b0C.\n6. Remove pot and place in ice water. (I do this in my sink)\n7. Once the mix has cooled right down, place it in the fridge overnight to age.\n8. Pour 100g of olive oil into some kind of jug or pouring vessel. Remove your mix from the fridge and prepare your ice cream maker.\n9. Churn. After ten minutes of churning, pause the machine and use an immersion blender to aggressively blend the olive oil into the mix as you steadily stream it in.\n10. Continue churning until soft serve stage and then decant into container and place in freezer. To serve, remove from freezer and place in fridge for approximately ten minutes to reach scooping temperature. (Probably! Who really knows?)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n1. You can use a vanilla bean or vanilla extract, but don't use *vanilla essence* which is basically just vanillin. Real vanilla has hundreds of other volatile aroma molecules, and some of these aroma molecules make a link with the aroma molecules in olive oil, which is why they make a great combination. Also real vanilla just tastes better when it's a main flavour in something like this. I wish it were cheaper.\n\n2. My original sugar quantities were sucrose 110g and dextrose 40g, which gave a serving temp. of -16\u00b0C. For this reformulated recipe the serving temp. according to ice cream calculator is -13\u00b0C. The POD is 149, so not super sweet.\n\n3. I'm actually considering doing this with 80g sucrose and 30g dextrose, which gives the same serving temp. of -13\u00b0C but a POD of 120.8, so much, much less sweet, more adult, and perhaps with the herbal flavours able to better shine through? Need to do more reading about how sugar might mask flavours.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k175kr", "created_utc": 1744875473.0, "score": 98, "author": "ps3hubbards", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1k175kr/olive_oil_vanilla_and_bay_leaf_ice_cream_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Posts here are in chronological order and they follow each other more or less. Sometimes the links inside the posts are broken, so this is a useful table of contents so to speak (that's why I made it for myself in the first place). \n\n[Ice Cream Series](https://under-belly.org/ice-cream-series/)\n\nShort introduction to what is ice cream and what\u2019ll be covered in the series. \n\n[The Components of Ice Cream](https://under-belly.org/the-components-of-ice-cream/)\n\nDiscusses milk and cream, sweeteners and other solids, stabilisers and emulsifiers, flavours. \n\n[How to Build an Ice Cream Recipe](https://under-belly.org/how-to-build-an-ice-cream-recipe/)\n\nAgain discusses basics of ice cream qualities and gives a master recipe for ice cream in percentages.

{"title": "Homemade Peach Crisp Ice Cream", "selftext": "Peaches. I love peaches so much. They make the Summer months bearable for me. They're sweet, juicy, flavorful, and when you find that REALLY delicious peach, doesn't the world feel good, and great, even just for a moment? I acquired a number of peaches from a local farm stand a few weeks back. First, I made a delicious peach cobbler and paired it with homemade vanilla ice cream. We consumed it in a day and a half and there was no time for pictures. \n\nThen I made peach crisp ice cream, pictured here. I chunked up pieces of homemade peach crisp into homemade buttermilk ice cream. The peach crisp was loaded with the most buttery, cinnamon forward oat topping of your life. The peaches were combined with a touch of sugar and lemon juice, all to preserve and enhance the delicate flavor of the fruit. Upon tasting it, I am now fully convinced peaches (and perhaps all stone-fruit) aren't meant to be eaten frozen. The buttermilk ice cream, albeit a GREAT idea, may have also been the wrong choice. The tang of the buttermilk seemed to overpower the peach flavor, which had already been dulled a touch after cooking them in the crisp. In the recipe provided, I have reduced the amount of buttermilk, so you will still get the tang, but a milder version. \n\nI've been thinking of ways to incorporate more peach flavor. I wanted to make a peach caramel to add to the ice cream, but feared it would only add more sweetness rather than more peachy goodness. Perhaps incorporating dehydrated peach powder into the caramel would boost the flavor. I have it on my list to try soon. \n\nIn the meantime, if you are a peach lover, you may have fun making this flavor. It's quite yummy, especially with the oat topping, but it's not as peachy as I was hoping for. \n\nIf you're not up for making both, the peach crisp recipe is divine, and can confirm quite yummy with  vanilla ice cream \n\nHere are the recipes! Let me know if you have any questions! \n\nPeach Crisp\nRecipe for 8 x 8 baking dish \n\nIngredients\n\nFilling\n5 peaches, sliced (I didn't peel mine, but you can!)\n1/4 cup all purpose flour, spooned and leveled\n1/2 cup granulated sugar (a touch less if your peaches are super ripe)\n1/8 tsp. salt\n1 Tbsp lemon juice\n1/4 tsp vanilla extract\n\nTopping\n1/2 + 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar\n2/3 cup all purpose flour\n2 tsp cinnamon \n1/4 tsp salt\n1 1/2 stick unsalted butter, cold and cubed\n2/3 cup old fashioned whole rolled oats\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350F\n\n2. Gently mix all of the filling ingredients together in a large bowl, then spread into the baking dish\n\n3. Make the topping: Whisk the brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and salt together in a medium bowl. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter or forks until the mixture is crumbly. Fold in oats. Sprinkle evenly over the filling. \n\n4. Bake for 45-50 minutes (rotating half way) until the topping is golden brown and the fruit juices are bubbling around the edges. Remove from the oven, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool completely before adding to ice cream.\n\nButtermilk Ice Cream\nyield: about 1.5 quarts \n\n2 cups heavy cream \n1 cup buttermilk \n3/4 cup white sugar \n1/2 cup nonfat dry milk powder \n2 egg yolks\ngenerous pinch salt \nsplash of good quality vanilla extract \n\n1. In a medium sized bowl, bring the heavy cream and vanilla extract to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, vigorously whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl. \n\n2. Once the cream is simmering, turn the heat low. Slowly pour the liquid into the yolks while whisking to temper the eggs. \n\n3. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and continue stirring until the sauce thickens slightly and coats the back of a wooden spoon, around 3-5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the buttermilk.\n\n4. Transfer to a clean bowl and cover with a lid. Chill until the mixture is cold, then prepare in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer instructions.\n\n5. Once churned, remove from the ice cream maker and add to a large, chilled bowl. Swirl in chunks of chilled peach crisp and gently stir until incorporated.

{"title": "Penn State - Ice Cream 101 Introduction to Frozen Desserts: Detailed Review", "selftext": "Last year when I was searching for information regarding Penn State\u2019s Ice Cream Short Course and/or Desserts 101, everything I saw had the experiences highly recommended but I could not find any specific details about the experience.\u00a0 Having just wrapped the Dessert 101 course this weekend, I wanted to share my feedback while the experience was fresh in the hopes that it will assist others in the future.\n\ntldr:\u00a0 Absolutely worth the time and money for the Dessert 101 Course if you:\n\n* Have made attempts at 8-10+ different homemade ice cream recipes so you know what success and failure looks like - (Cuisinart ICE or an old rock salt machine is perfectly fine or borrow something don\u2019t buy anything big for this).\n* Do some textbook reading beforehand so technical lectures won\u2019t be over your head.\n* Engage with the vendors and grab their contact info, even if still forming a concept.\n\nPrior to Attending:\n\nI have been fairly active in the kitchen for the last three years, first attending and later volunteering to assist as sous chef for classes at a local culinary center, covering cuisines all over the world - altogether about 500 hours of experience as an understudy for very experienced executive chefs in said commercial kitchen.\u00a0 Additionally most every Saturday for the last two years I have challenged myself to create either dish completely foreign to me or something familiar using a new cooking technique.\u00a0 This includes about a dozen reasonably successful ice creams starting from a French vanilla base, a couple of sub-par attempts at sorbet and gelato.\u00a0 Everything I\u2019ve attempted I\u2019ve captured the recipes along with complete notes and alterations so I know what to do (and not do) next time.\n\nI read chapters 1-4 and 7-9 of \u2018Ice Cream\u2019, Goff, 7th edition, from a PDF online.\u00a0 In retrospect chapters 5 and 10 would have  been helpful, but I ran out of time.\u00a0 My reading helped me significantly because the class was not the first time I was seeing these words and hearing these concepts; they had been previously introduced to me and Dr. Roberts and others were able to put the textbook information in context of what I as a small batch processor would actually use in the United States at present.\u00a0 I would consider those chapters required reading for anyone wanting to maximize their experience.\n\nRegistration and Travel:\n\nSign ups for the course opened up the morning of July 18th, 2024. I had checked the page \\*at least\\* every day since the first of June.\u00a0 The 7-day course was already full so I immediately signed up for the Ice Cream 101 course.\u00a0\n\nThe Monday of the week of the event, I received an email with the agenda attached.\n\nOn Thursday I flew in from KC to Pittsburgh, got a rental car and did the 2.5 hr drive to State College, PA without incident, arriving about 3:30pm local time.\u00a0 I stayed at the Hyatt off of Beaver Ave, but pretty much any hotel in the area is going to be within 10 minutes of the venue. There are also flight options to State College, PA itself (really!), Philadelphia, or Baltimore.\u00a0 Get your hotel early, college events scheduled that weekend may cause rooms to fill up closer to the date and prices may skyrocket.\n\nEvent Experience:\n\nRegistration was Friday, 11am at the Penn Stater.\u00a0 It\u2019s handled like any small conference event in a hotel, signed in at the registration table, got my swag and box lunch (sandwich, cookie, chips, fruit, drink) and headed to the assigned conference room.\u00a0 All class materials and slides, probably around 150 pages, are given out in a large 3-ring binder.\n\nThe room held 100 people, there were a little over 75 attendees on the contact info sheet with 7-8 staff members/presenters and 7-8 speakers and vendors in attendance.\u00a0 Of those 75 people, 17 states were represented and several countries including Japan, China, Mexica, Singapore.\u00a0 Most of the US attendees\u00a0 were within 300 miles of PA.\u00a0 Everyone gave a brief 45-60 second introduction, while there were some people that were new to ice cream making and there to learn, most either owned or had stated plans to own a restaurant, coffee shop, or ice cream shop and were looking to gain skills.\u00a0 Several had been in business for quite a few years and were looking to hone their skills in the interest of continuing education.\u00a0 There were a few dairy farm owners that were seeking to make the jump to ice cream manufacture.\n\nThe first day\u2019s reception event was reasonably well attended, I met a few contacts and am glad I stayed. \u00a0 Also, there were three ice creams available to sample - Peachy Paterno, Raspberry Torte, Death by Chocolate.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have any official Berkey Creamery after that, but had about 10-14 other flavor samples during labs, not counting the 10-12 vanilla and chocolate samples in the tasting lab.\n\nCourse Content:\n\n(not including lunch/breaks)\n\nFirst day was 5 hrs of lecture.\u00a0\n\nSecond day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.\n\nThird day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.\u00a0\n\nFor labs, the class was split up into three groups of approximately\u00a0 25 people each.\n\nSession topics included: Ice Cream Overview, Composition, Ice Cream Operation, Ingredients, Fresh Fruit, Mix Processing, Make Your Own Mix?, Flavors and Inclusions, Self Serve and Fresh Serve, Gelato, Entrepreneurial Topic, Freezing and Hardening, Post Freezing and Customer Engagement, Non-Dairy Desserts, Equipment Choices, Choosing Mix Suppliers, and Food Regulations.\n\nLab Exercises/Demonstration topics included: Soft Serve/Direct Draw machine maintenance and use, alcohol freezing, handheld treats, and Batch Freezers types and use with ice creams, gelatos and custards, ice cream formulations (taste testing 10-11 different samples and judging respective quality, defects, etc.)\n\nI am sure the above is subject to change based on need and speaker availability.\u00a0 Class flow was excellent and modules built on each other with little to no overlap on topics.\u00a0 Dr. Roberts ran a tight ship, this entire event was on time to the minute.\u00a0 Class attendees asked great questions, no one got off topic or meandered into any side discussions.\u00a0\n\nPersonal Notes:\n\nI'm glad I did the 101 course, it was stated during the sessions that the primary difference between the 101 and the 7-day short course was days of additional content (and presumably labs) on each individual ingredient and mix formulation.\u00a0 While the labs would have been fun, the lecture would have not been useful to me as someone not employed by a large-scale manufacturer.\n\nI was not at the point where I had a defined concept and business plan, so I was not quite ready to establish formal relationships with vendors and suppliers.\u00a0 But I took down everyone\u2019s information, am sending thank you emails now and will follow up when my plans have \u2018hardened,\u2019 pun intended.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this course did accomplish all of my personal goals: I will be digging deeper into the regulations around starting my own small business, reaching out to local commissaries to inquire about capabilities in hosting me as a startup, getting my own at-home blast freezer, developing relationships with my restaurant contacts to get placement in their venues, and putting together an ice cream class that I myself will teach where I\u2019ve previously been volunteering.  So very successful all around.\n\nHope the above write-up was helpful; best of luck to future classes and attendees.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1igbyao/penn_state_ice_cream_101_introduction_to_frozen/", "created_utc": 1738541689.0, "score": 88, "author": "jt15550", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1igbyao/penn_state_ice_cream_101_introduction_to_frozen/", "html_title": ""}

Heat the liquid ingredients in a saucepan, stirring frequently, until they reach 40\u00b0C\n\n\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients to evenly disperse the stabilizer.\n\n\n3. Whisk the egg yolks until pale yellow.\n\n\n4. When the liquid mixture reaches 40\u00b0C, add the dry ingredients while stirring.\n\n\n5. Gradually incorporate the egg yolks into the mixture.\n\n\n6. Heat the mixture to 75\u00b0C, then transfer to a container to cool and age.\n\n\nZABAIONE MIXTURE\n\n- Egg yolks: 100g\n\n- Marsala wine: 100g\n\n- Sugar: 100g\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Whisk the sugar and yolks together until pale and fluffy.\n\n\n2. Fold in the Marsala wine.\n\n\n3. Cook the mixture over a bain-marie, whisking constantly until it reaches 80\u00b0C.\n\n\nFINAL STEPS\n\n1. Once both mixtures are cooled, blend them together.\n\n2. Add vanilla to taste, then churn the mix in your ice cream machine (I use the Cuisinart ICE30BCU) for about 30 minutes.\n\nThe result is a rich, silky Zabaione ice cream that\u2019s perfect on its own but is amazing if paired with enriched dough desserts or biscuits. \n\nMy only complaint is that it could be boozier but it might be my love of marsala talking, lol.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hleh4r", "created_utc": 1735049978.0, "score": 85, "author": "Irohs_Apothecary", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1hleh4r/zabaione_gelato/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Coconut Ice Cream, FINALLY!", "selftext": "Coconut is one of my favorite ice cream flavors, and I\u2019ve been trying for a LONG time to get my recipe right. I\u2019ve tried pretty much every recipe/suggestion out there (yes, even the one you\u2019re going to suggest in the comments, lol!) but it was never quite right \u2013 texture too hard or too soft, not coconut-y enough, etc. But I FINALLY figured out how to do it the way I like it, so I thought I\u2019d share if anyone else is on the same \u201cjourney\u201d! I\u2019ll note that although I do like the Salt & Straw vegan coconut base (and other vegan coconut recipes I\u2019ve tried), I wanted mine to have a more traditional ice cream texture.\n\nFirst off, I used [frozen grated coconut](https://www.amazon.com/Frozen-Grated-Coconut-16oz-Pack/dp/B0799QR7BM) that I found at my local Filipino market. This turned out to have a much more fresh, \u201creal coconut\u201d flavor than the dried coconut I had always used previously. I\u2019m not sure how hard it is to find outside of the San Francisco Bay Area. Same thing with the [Kara boxed coconut cream](https://www.amazon.com/Kara-UHT-Coconut-Cream-16-9/dp/B00558UW64) \u2013 I\u2019ve used Aroy-D brand, but getting it boxed rather than canned has been important for me in getting the texture right. You\u2019ll note that I omitted a stabilizer (I usually use Cremodan 30) because the Kara coconut cream already includes xanthan and guar gums.\n\nSo I combined:\n\n* 500g Kara boxed coconut cream\n* 150g whole milk\n* 150g heavy whipping cream\n* 225g frozen grated coconut (half the one-pound package)\n\nI heated it up on the stove, then let it cool (covered) before putting in the refrigerator to sit overnight. The next day, I strained out the coconut and set it aside for later use. I ended up losing a significant amount of liquid in the process, so I added 130g more coconut cream and 90g more milk to bring the total weight back up to 800g.\n\nThen I added the following:\n\n* 200g sugar\n* 50g Karo light corn syrup\n* 3 egg yolks\n* Pinch of salt\n\nI heated the base up on the stove again, to 170F degrees, and removed it from the heat. I added a little of the liquid to 130g of the grated coconut I had previously strained out and pureed it with a stick blender, then added that pureed mixture into the base. Then I let it sit overnight and churned it. It was almost perfect! I like it slightly more scoopable, so I may up my sugar to 225g next time, but I was very delighted with the result.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/vliaw0/coconut_ice_cream_finally/", "created_utc": 1656289087.0, "score": 81, "author": "GGxGG", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/vliaw0/coconut_ice_cream_finally/", "html_title": ""}

I decided to plug it into the Ice Cream Calculator so that I could get a quick overview, see if there was anything I might want to tweak right off the bat, and quickly scale the (1 qt?) recipe to my 4 qt machine. \n\nSubtract the strawberry chunk mix-in ingredients from the full ingredient list and you get a base comprised of:\n\n- 2 cups half and half*  \n- 0.75 cup sucrose  \n- 0.5 cup corn syrup  \n- 1.5 cups strawberry pur\u00e9e  \n- pinch of salt  \n\nIce Cream Calc throws out a lot of flags. Very low on fat. Rather low in total solids. Quite high in sugar/POD. \n\n*The fact that it uses half and half (which can legally contain anywhere from 10.5% to 18% milkfat) rather than specific amounts of milk and cream is also concerning me. I used the default half and half (12%) that was in the Ice Cream Calc database, for what it's worth (to get the overview - I haven't made it yet).\n\nFinally, Ice Cream Calc indicates that the mix volume *prior to churning* AND *prior to adding the strawberry chunks* is already a hair over 1 qt. Accounting for overrun and mix-ins, you're looking at an extra ~25% volume over what the recipe indicates it makes. So that's a little annoying, and I'm glad I plugged it into the calc. But, to be fair, not an indicator that the recipe isn't good or won't \"work\".\n\n__\n\nNow, I've definitely had some good ice cream that the Ice Cream Calc didn't \"like\". So I know it's just another tool in the kit and not something to religiously adhere to when your own tastebuds disagree with it.\n\nAnd, to the recipe's credit, the scoopability/serving temp metrics are looking good. So it shouldn't turn out a hard, frozen block nor a soupy mess that won't freeze. But I just wanted to get some input and thoughts from anyone who has tried the recipe. (My gut says just steal the sugar/alcohol-soaked berry chunks and put it  and the strawberry pur\u00e9e into a more familiar base.)\n\nOr, even better, an explanation from someone knowledgeable in \"ice cream science\" to tell me why this recipe works *despite* a number of the metrics being off in the calc. Is it just the nature of fruit-heavy flavors - with their high water content - that necessitates an ice cream lower in solids and higher sugar? Does the corn syrup really have such a large effect on the \"creaminess\" of the ice cream? I've been using it in my recipes at a much lower rate (about 0.33 to 0.5 cups corn syrup to 1.5 to 2 cups sucrose) to improve scoopability, so I have some familiarity with the product.

I experimented at my own store this week by brewing the vanilla base we get (10qts) with 1 lb of beans and tried two batches one with unground one with ground beans. Brought the base with the beans/grounds in it up to 120F in a pot on an induction stove, set the stove to 160 and had it stay on heat for 2 hours. Refigerate beans-in overnight and used next day.\n\nI was so excited that the FLAVOR was incredible. HOWEVER i was straining the grinds batch for over an hour! I lost about 25% of the base to straining and could not seem to get the grinds out. Looking into it I need to get either a brew bag or use a cheesecloth so i come here for advice on which method to use. Should i crush the beans instead of grinding them? Would it still need brew bag/cheesecloth?\n\nBTW the unground batch was very deep and smooth, less acidic. Needed some instant coffee for punch though it was the base for pic #3 Mocha Cookie Fudge. \n\nGrinds batch after straining did have the grinds affect mouthfeel so i called it \"Artisanal Coffee\" so i turned it into an upside lol. This batch had more acidity and completely powerful flavor which i loved as a coffee addict.

I just realized that it is likely due to my current job's machine actually being a *gelato* spinner.

Sometimes the ice cream gets softer over time; why would that happen? Why am I having trouble maintaining a scoopable ice cream texture now that I am using a gelato machine? It is just always either too hard, as if there isn't enough air folded into it, or too soft, as if I have used too much soft sugars. \n\nPlease let me know your theories on what is going on and what I can adjust in my recipes to find more success with my gelato spinner when I am technically trying to make ice cream. \n\nThank you so much in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1k6ydra/ice_cream_spun_in_gelato_machine_professional/", "created_utc": 1745516471.0, "score": 3, "author": "charlollie", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1k6ydra/ice_cream_spun_in_gelato_machine_professional/", "html_title": ""}

Would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThis is the recipe as provided by David Lebovitz....\n\n**Panforte ice cream Makes about 1 quart (1l)**\n\nRecipe adapted from The Perfect Scoop I use a honey that\u2019s on the stronger side, which provides the best flavor. If you have buckwheat honey, that\u2019s my favorite, but any honey that\u2019s on the darker side will work, although you can also use mild honey, too.\n\n1 cup (250ml) half-and-half or whole milk\n\n2/3 cup (130g) sugar\n\n1 cinnamon stick, broken in half\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\n\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\nBig pinch of salt 2 cups (500ml) heavy cream\n\n4 large egg yolks\n\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\n3 tablespoons (45ml) strongly flavored honey\n\n1/2 cup (80-100g) chopped candied citrus peel\n\n1/2 cup (65g) toasted almonds, coarsely chopped\n\nIn a medium saucepan, warm the half-and-half or milk with the sugar, spices, and salt. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 1 hour to steep. When ready to make the ice cream, pour the cream into a medium-large bowl. Set the bowl of cream into a larger bowl that\u2019s partially filled with ice and a little water, and set a mesh strainer over the top of the bowl of cream.\n\nRewarm the spice-infused mixture. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg yolks, whisking constantly as you pour, then scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan. Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof flexible spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula. Pour the custard through the strainer into the cream. Discard or compost the cinnamon stick. Add the vanilla to the custard. Stir the custard until cool. While the custard is cooling, warm the honey in a small saucepan, then stir it into the custard. Chill the mixture thoroughly, then freeze in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. When the ice cream is finished churning, stir in the chopped candied citrus peel and almonds.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4oqlggv0sive1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d31c9c35fd51afa73b4931a1e0ab65f68b3c19a\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1k1w9nn/panforte_ice_cream/", "created_utc": 1744949899.0, "score": 12, "author": "kraj3187", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1k1w9nn/panforte_ice_cream/", "html_title": ""}

Especially in other subreddits (more specifically the creami one), you see just the most random things being thrown into a cup and praying it doesn't catch fire or break the machine (which seems to happen a lot).\n\nI tried using one of the \"Wizard\" recipes from IceCreamCalc as a base, and I gave the resulting list of ingredients and target ratios to an LLM. I also asked for a Python script I could run to verify the ratios. Here's the prompt\n\n    I am looking to make a vanilla gelato.

I want you to use these ingredients and make me a recipe. I also want you to create a python script that then verifies the ratios. The ratios I'm looking at are\n    \n    Milk fat (5 to 9%)\n    Total fat (5-12%)\n    Milk solids (16-22%)\n    Total solids (35-40%)\n    Water (60-65%)\n    Serving temp (-14c to -11c at 74%)\n    Pod of 165 to 185\n    Stabilizers/Water of 0.2-0.35%\n    Emulsifiers of 0.3 to 0.5%\n    Lactose concentration <10%\n\nThe resulting recipe was\n\nIngredient\t\n\nWhole Milk (3.5%)\t597 \n\nHeavy Cream (36%)\t145 \n\nSkim Milk Powder\t43 \n\nSucrose\t50 \n\nDextrose\t155 \n\nLecithin (Soy)\t4 \n\nGuar Gum\t0.75\n\nCMC\t0.75 \n\nVanilla Pod\t1 \n\nVanilla Extract\t5 \n\nTotal\t1000\n\nWhile the IceCreamCalc was \n\nIngredient\t\n\nWhole Milk (3.5%)\t587 \n\nHeavy Cream (36%)\t177 \n\nSkim Milk Powder\t45 \n\nSucrose\t134 \n\nDextrose\t44 \n\nLecithin (Soy)\t4 \n\nStabilizer\t1.71 \n\nVanilla Pod\t1 \n\nVanilla Extract\t5 \n\nTotal\t1000\n\n  \nAs you can see, not TOO far off, heavier on the cream, more dextrose than sucrose which results in a serving temp of \\~16\u00baC @ 69%, which from the explanation, it wasn't able to calculate.

{"title": "Olive oil, vanilla and bay leaf ice cream - a delicious and mostly successful experiment", "selftext": "This is a follow-up to my previous post asking for advice and input on making olive oil ice cream, so thank you to those who made helpful comments.\n\nI'll write some notes about what I did, and then I'll write a recipe which reflects what I would do next time. Skip to the recipe if you have no interest in the experimentation process.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe first step was I took my 100g of extra virgin olive oil (decent quality stuff, nice grassy/herbal flavour, but not fruity/floral like I should do in future) and I put five dried bay leaves in it and heated for about 15 minutes at between 60 and 80\u00b0C to infuse the flavour. I tasted the oil afterwards and frankly I don't think this worked! Possibly the bay leaves I've grown are just not that strong, or the olive oil flavour is too strong.\n\nThe base was heated with three more bay leaves and one vanilla pod with all seeds scraped into the mix. I tasted this after it had been brought up to 84\u00b0C and was cooling down again, and it tasted delicious. Predominantly vanilla, but the bay leaf was also there backing it up. Nice combination.\n\nThe next tasting point was after the olive oil had been added and churning was just completed. (This took longer than the usual 30 minutes to get to soft serve stage which seemed like a bad sign). I think tasting at this point is the moment you know whether you've got something magic, and in this case, yes I did. I was genuinely surprised, I think I said \"Oh!\" out loud. Also, could I taste the bay leaves anymore? Not sure!\n\nThe final tasting point was after it had been in a container for several hours to freeze statically, and I have to say when I tasted it straight out of the freezer it was great, but it didn't quite have the same wow factor any more... Perhaps the fact it wasn't my first impression didn't help, but anyway this led me to decide that I should aim for a higher scooping temperature so that it would be warmer upon consumption, and therefore hopefully the flavour would be more 'available' so to speak, to the taste buds. This of course means that it won't be so scoopable straight out of the freezer and might need ten minutes in the fridge before serving. The side benefit is that less sugar might mask the flavours less? And perhaps I should try to decrease the sugars even more...\n\n\nRECIPE\n\nI'm definitely onto something with this one!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n500g whole milk (~3.5% fat)\n100g heavy cream (36% fat)\n50g skim milk powder\n130g sucrose\n100g olive oil\n54g egg yolk (= 3 large egg yolks for me)\n1/8tsp xanthan gum, level\n1/8tsp guar gum, rounded (Use your preferred stabiliser/s. I like these because they have synergy)\n1/4tsp salt (~1.4g)\n7 to 10 bay leaves (I have access to a tree with plenty of leaves. If bay leaves are expensive for you, you could just omit these. Bay is not the main flavour)\n1 vanilla bean. Scrape the seeds and cut into pieces with scissors when adding to base.\n\nMETHOD\n1. Add all dry ingredients to a bowl and mix well to disperse stabilisers.\n2. Add milk cream, eggs, bay leaves and vanilla to a pot and whisk thoroughly.\n3. Slowly and gently heat the mixture, whisking continuously and tracking it with a thermometer.\n4. When it's above 40\u00b0C whisk in the dry ingredients.\n5. Continue slowly heating and whisking until it reaches 84\u00b0C.\n6. Remove pot and place in ice water. (I do this in my sink)\n7. Once the mix has cooled right down, place it in the fridge overnight to age.\n8. Pour 100g of olive oil into some kind of jug or pouring vessel. Remove your mix from the fridge and prepare your ice cream maker.\n9. Churn. After ten minutes of churning, pause the machine and use an immersion blender to aggressively blend the olive oil into the mix as you steadily stream it in.\n10. Continue churning until soft serve stage and then decant into container and place in freezer. To serve, remove from freezer and place in fridge for approximately ten minutes to reach scooping temperature. (Probably! Who really knows?)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n1. You can use a vanilla bean or vanilla extract, but don't use *vanilla essence* which is basically just vanillin. Real vanilla has hundreds of other volatile aroma molecules, and some of these aroma molecules make a link with the aroma molecules in olive oil, which is why they make a great combination. Also real vanilla just tastes better when it's a main flavour in something like this. I wish it were cheaper.\n\n2. My original sugar quantities were sucrose 110g and dextrose 40g, which gave a serving temp. of -16\u00b0C. For this reformulated recipe the serving temp. according to ice cream calculator is -13\u00b0C. The POD is 149, so not super sweet.\n\n3. I'm actually considering doing this with 80g sucrose and 30g dextrose, which gives the same serving temp. of -13\u00b0C but a POD of 120.8, so much, much less sweet, more adult, and perhaps with the herbal flavours able to better shine through?

{"title": "Best ice cream (custard) base I found that works great for Ninja Creami", "selftext": "Posted this in a reply and figured it would be a good separate post.\n\n\nRecipe adapted from \"The best Ice cream maker cookbook ever - Peggy Fallon\" after I tried MANY.\n\n\nI find french custard makes an amazing base. Below is the recipe I used and taking the Ice cream out of the freezer a bit early to warm in fridge had it lasting several days.\n\nThat said the Ninja Creami has changed my life and I sold my compressor model. 400ml divided containers, if they get a bit too hard you just respin and freeze again so you NEVER have blocks of ice or feel the need to eat the whole sucker fast. FANTASTIC textures. Larger batches I just transfer to 1L insulated ice cream containers after spinning and refreeze. I would never go back.\n\nThis is for using the entire 1L (938g) container of 35% cream I get from Costco. Scale as you like.\n\n35% cream - 938g (1L/quart container)\n\nWhole milk (have done with 2% as well) - 300g\n\nSugar - 191g\n\nEgg yolks - 7.6 (I round up to 8)\n\nVanilla extract - 22.5g (22.5 ml)\n\nIf doing chocolate (7.5 tablespoons dutch processed powdered baking cocoa - sorry keep forgetting to weigh)\n\nIf doing mint - 15 ml peppermint extract + 24 drops green foodcoloring (can add 75g chopped dark chocolate or chopped bitter-sweet bakers chocolate while spinning)\n\nThis makes a bit over 3 containers (500ml containers but you only fill 400ml/g) for the Creami or about 1.5L in a traditional manner.\n\nAdd cream, milk, sugar and heat while stirring to 160F (71C) and mixture starts to coat back of a spoon and remove from heat.\n\nWhisk the egg yolks in another bowl and add 1-2 cups of the hot mixture to the yolks while mixing then pour back into the hot mixture while whisking.\n\nIf you are doing vanilla add at the cooling phase. If you are doing mint I would add vanilla and mint during the heating phase as I found I needed to blow off the alcohol or it was too soft. If doing chocolate I would add vanilla after cooling as the alcohol helps keep it soft.\n\n(With the Creami it is easy to split the base and do 3 different batches. Eg. 1/3 as pure vanilla - (pour 400ml mixture into container and add 7.5ml vanilla extract), 1/3 as mint chocolate (pour 400ml/g into small pot and heat a bit as adding 7.5ml vanilla extract + 5ml peppermint extract + 8 drops green food colouring then after frozen spin once then incorporate spin 25g chopped dark chocolate), 1/3 chocolate (pour 400ml/g into a small pot, add 2.5 tablespoons dutch processed powered cacao, transfer to Creami container and add 7.5ml vanilla extract before freezing).\n\nHope this helps.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1jvhiua/best_ice_cream_custard_base_i_found_that_works/", "created_utc": 1744234617.0, "score": 5, "author": "frozennorthfruit", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1jvhiua/best_ice_cream_custard_base_i_found_that_works/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sugars - dealing with polyols", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have been reading up a lot on polyols and trying to come up with recipes replacing normal sugars (sucrose, glucose, syrups) with them. The calculator I use (IceCreamCalc) uses the biblical ratios from Goff's book, which have sugars as one of the targets. Most of the polyols have 0 sugar in them, so the calculator (especially the balancer) will try to come up with weird methods to bump the sugar.\n\nHow should we be dealing with polyols? Should we completely drop sugars for POD when dealing with these low-sugar/no-sugar recipes? If so, what values should we be looking to target?\n\nTrying to answer myself - a recipe with equal POD + solids should taste and feel similar enough. There are a lot of variables that a calculator can't account for, given that polyols are not as fungible as sucrose, and also some have some side effects, e.g. erythritol has a cooling effect.

My understanding is that while lactose can contribute to viscosity, it also poses a risk of crystallization, which is generally undesirable in ice cream. (Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u2014I\u2019m still learning!)\n\nSince glucose doesn\u2019t seem to have any major downsides in ice cream and adds sweetness (thanks to its higher POD compared to lactose), I thought using lactose-free dairy might actually offer some advantages. It\u2019s sweeter and might even improve texture in some cases. So why don\u2019t more shops use it?\n\nIs it mostly a cost issue?

{"title": "\ud83c\udf4b FINALLY, MY LEMON BAR ICE CREAM RECIPE! \ud83c\udf4b", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI wanted to finally share my Lemon Bar Ice Cream recipe as a token of my appreciation! I am so darn sorry for the time it is taking my cookbook to hit store shelves, and I know many of you are anxious to try my recipes. This flavor was my top seller when I was wholesaling pints in Seattle. It is an intensely Lemon ice cream with pieces of homemade Lemon Bars - with a buttery shortbread crust which is one of my favorite parts! After reviewing the recipe, please let me know if you have any questions. Also, if you make it, please let us know your thoughts! \n\nLastly, follows on SM matter the most to publishers. My handles are in my profile. Obviously, no pressure and thank you for considering. Thank you, too, for all of your support and encouragement you have shared along the way! May you cherish and love this recipe just as I and so many folks in Seattle have! \n\nMost warmly,\nLauren \nSweet Lo\u2019s Ice Cream \n\n\nMy Famous Lemon Bar \n\nThis is one of my most sought after recipes! Behind Cookies N Cream, Lemon Bar was the second most popular flavor sold in grocery stores in Seattle. Luscious lemon ice cream chock full of homemade lemon bars. My favorite part is the buttery crust of the lemon bar mixed with the tangy, sweet ice cream. Even if you\u2019re not necessarily a fan of lemon, this combination has the power to change your mind and buds! \n\nYield: about 2 quarts \n\nIntensely Lemon Ice Cream Base \n\nZest of 3 large lemons separated\n1 cup (200g) white sugar\n1 \u00bd cups (368g) whole milk\n1 \u00bd cups (357g) heavy cream\n\u00bc cup (33g) nonfat dry milk powder\n\u00bc tsp (1.3g) salt\n\u00be cup (172.5g) lemon juice, from the 3 lemons you zested \n3 (54g) egg yolks\n\n2 cups lemon bars, chopped (recipe below) \n\nBefore starting, set aside a medium sized bowl (one with a lid) with a fine mesh strainer on top. \n\n1. Zest all three lemons. Add the sugar and \u00be of the lemon zest to a small bowl and massage the zest into the sugar until combined.\n2. In a medium-sized heavy bottom saucepan, add the whole milk, heavy cream, nonfat dry milk powder, sugar and salt. Heat over low to medium heat, gently bringing the mixture up to a low simmer. Simmer for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously until all ingredients are dissolved. Remove from heat, cover the saucepan, and allow to steep for 20 minutes.\n3. While the dairy mixture is steeping, juice the three lemons. Strain the pulp and seeds. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the pulp and add it back into the juice. Put the juice in a jar with a lid, and set aside in the refrigerator. It will be added to the base, once the base has cooled completely.\n4. After 20 minutes, uncover the saucepan and bring mixture back to a simmer over low heat. While the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\n5. Once the dairy mixture is warm, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn heat to medium. As the yolks warm, you\u2019ll notice the mixture start to thicken.\nContinue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon and registers about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer, about 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer. \n6. Allow the base to cool at room temperature for an hour. Add a lid and refrigerate for 5 hours. Once the base is completely chilled, stir in the lemon juice with pulp and remaining lemon zest. Re-lid and keep in the refrigerator and allow the base to age overnight. Make the lemon bars. \n7. When you are ready to churn, give the base a stir with a whisk and pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream maker. Freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. \n8. To assemble your Lemon Bar Ice Cream: Remove churned ice cream from the machine into a medium sized bowl. Gently stir in the lemon bar chunks, adding more as you see fit. \n9. Scoop churned ice cream into an airtight container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on (the lid won\u2019t fit if the container is too full). Freeze until the ice cream is firm and flavor is ripened, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nLemon Bars \nYield: 9 x 13 pan \n\nFor the crust: \n6 oz (170g) salted butter, melted\n\u2153 cup + 2 tbsp (90g) white sugar\n\u00bd tsp (2.6g) salt\n1 tsp (4.4g) vanilla extract \n1 \u00bd cup (192g) flour \n\nFor the Lemon Filling:\n6 (300g) eggs \n2 1/4 cup (450g) white sugar \n1 \u00bc cup 287g) fresh lemon juice \n\u00be tsp lemon extract \n\u00be cup + 1 tbsp (102g) flour, sifted\n\n\u00be cup powdered sugar, sifted, for topping once cooled (optional) \n\n1. Set the oven to 350F degrees. Lightly grease your baking pan with shortening and line with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium sized pot, gently melt the butter over low heat. Once the butter is melted, remove from the heat and stir in sugar, salt and vanilla extract. Continue to stir the mixture for 1 minute to bring down the temperature slightly.\n3. Add the flour to the sugar/butter mixture and mix well, until it forms a soft dough.\nTransfer the dough to the prepared pan and gently work the dough into a thin, even layer.* The dough will appear greasy - this is perfect. The secret to working with the dough is to be gentle and to work between using your fingers and your palms to push it into place. You will find that it can be manipulated easily. \n4. Bake the crust for 20 -25 minutes. When the crust is done, it will be a golden brown color. \n5. While the crust is baking, make the filling. Whisk together the eggs and sugar. \nGently mix in the lemon juice and lemon extract.\n6. Sift the flour into the mixture and whisk vigorously until fully combined.\n7. Lastly, strain the lemon mixture through a sieve to thin out any lumps. You can press any remaining flour bits through the strainer, into the mixture. \n8. Once the crust has finished baking, pour the lemon mixture over the hot crust and return to the oven. Bake for an additional 20-25 minutes. This time varies, so begin with 20 minutes and add time as needed. Bake until the center is set and does not wiggle when moved. \n9. Let cool to room temperature. Cover with foil and refrigerate until ready to chop and add small squares to churned ice cream. If you are topping with sifted powdered sugar, do so now. Enjoy the remaining lemon bars with a cup of tea or alongside a scoop of lemon bar or vanilla ice cream\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrlh4v", "created_utc": 1743797604.0, "score": 466, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1jrlh4v/finally_my_lemon_bar_ice_cream_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

After me trying it I found that those lumps are hard and have a hair-like structure, it seemed like stabilizers kind of coagulated and formed them. Now I wonder what did I wrong, if proportion of stabilizers is right. Is it too much churning? I've never heard before that exceccive churning can make stabilizers to clump together. I also used a hand blender to make the base, and I've blended it when stabilizers were in, too. Maybe it's too much of a mechanical action? Or I just have had a bad mango with too much fiber? I also cut it nearly to the seed, maybe it seed's tissue interfered with stabilizers?

{"title": "Texture Tips for Fruit-Based Ice Cream", "selftext": "hi there! This is my first post on here, i've been experimenting making ice cream for the last few months.  One of the issues i've run into is when making fruit based flavors (think black raspberry, blueberry, banana chip, etc.), my texture tends to come out more icy than i would like as opposed to creamy.  I managed to make a pretty solid strawberry but have otherwise been struggling with this.  Does anyone have any tips to fix this?\n\nFor more context, I use Jeni Britton's method from her masterclass which uses no eggs (i've tried many different base recipes and have found this one has yielded the best results for me). I also ideally like to use as many fresh/real ingredients as possible as opposed to artificial flavoring.  I fear this might be the root cause of the issue since i'm relying a lot on the fruit and berries for the flavor which tend to have high water content.  \n\nWould love any tips or thoughts you guys might have!

Then I heat all the liquid (2 quarts heavy cream, 2 quarts whole milk). As it heats, I add 1 cup monk fruit (edit: Whole Earth variety sweetener, which does contain Erythritol) and 1.5 cups sugar.

The only difference between the recipes as far as I can tell is I added 1/4 tsp of salt to the first batch (which turned out grainy).  Can that amount of salt affect the emulsification or freezing point drastically? Or could it be some other reason (an inconsistency in how I mixed my base or something?).  I did notice that my first batch (with salt) did not have frozen base on the sides of the bowl, which was unusual but I would be surprised if that small amount of salt could change the freezing point that drastically.  Here are the recipes/images:\n\nBatch 1 (the grainy one):\n\n1 1/2 cup of milk\n\n1 1/2 cup of heavy cream\n\n1/2 cup + 1 tbsp of granulated sugar (112.5 grams)\n\n1/2 cup of peanut butter ( I used creamy Jiff)\n\n1/4 tsp xanthan gum\n\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n\n1/4 tsp salt\n\nI put the milk and peanut butter into my hand food processor, grinded it up until it was a consistent liquid. Then I put it into a pot at low heat, and dissolved the sugar, xanthan gum, salt into the mixture.

While researching recipes, I came across a proper ice cream channel, @PolarIceCreamery, and ended up going down a three-day rabbit hole, binge-watching almost all of his videos. My wife, rightfully so, is frustrated that I wasted all that time and still don't have a healthy, high-protein ice cream recipe for us. So now, I'm trying to prove that high-protein ice cream isn't going to taste as good as a well-balanced ice cream made with SKM powder, heavy cream, evaporated milk, and stabilizers. So we are going to do a taste test to see if all the extra ingredients/time is worth it. \n\nWhat I'm looking for: Your favorite well balanced vanilla base for Oreo ice cream for my ninja creami.

While continuing to whisk, bring the temperature up to 84^(o)C where a custard will form. Remove from the heat.\n7. Chill for at least four hours but ideally overnight.\n8.

Mix the sugar (or allulose) with the skim milk powder (if using), carboxymethyl cellulose, guar gum and lambda carrageenan. If you don't have the stabilizers, which are the last three ingredients, for easy-to-find stabilizers, substitute 1 g of xanthan gum, and then dissolve 3 g of gelatin in about \u2153 of the milk you heat to 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). If you don't have any stabilizers at all, you can still make this recipe, but you might need to eat it immediately when you're done, because it might not keep well in the freezer overnight.\n2. If you are not using pecan butter, you will need to grind the pecans into a paste, which is pecan butter. The best way is with a melanger or wet grinder, but it is possible with a blender or food processor, scraping down the sides every so often.\n3. Put one egg yolk (and half the water, if using) into a cylindrical container, slightly wider than the diameter of your immersion blender. Start your immersion blender, and add the pecan butter, a little at a time. If your blender struggles to incorporate, add a little of the cold milk, until it no longer struggles. Continue to add the pecan butter until you have used half the pecan butter, and set it aside. Repeat the entire process with the other egg yolk (and the rest of the water, if using) with the other half of the pecan butter.\n3. Put a little of the pecan mixture, (a little of the melted butter, if using,) a little of the milk and a little of the sugar mixture into the blender and blend until well combined. Only do a little, or else you might clog your blender. Once blended, pour into a bowl, and then put a little of the pecan mixture, (melted butter, if using,) milk and sugar mixture into the blender again, blending and pouring into the bowl once more. Repeat until all your ingredients are blended together.\n4. If you have an ice cream maker, empty the bowl into your ice cream maker, and follow the manufacturer's instructions for making ice cream. If your ice cream maker doesn't have its own compressor, you will need to let you batter cool to at least room temperature first. If you don't have an ice cream maker, empty the bowl into a loaf pan, and then place it in the freezer, scraping down the sides and bottom with a spatula and then beating with an electric mixer every 10 to 15 minutes, until your desired consistency.\n\n#Variations:\n1. If you're allergic to eggs, remove the eggs. Instead, use 2 g of soy lecithin (or 0.8 g polysorbate 80), 7 g pecan and 25 g water, which is enough to replace the two eggs.\n2. For butter pecan gelato, let the pecan butter sit in a container at room temperature, until the oil rises to the top. While still in the container, weigh the pecan butter (in the container). Gently remove pecan oil. Now weigh again and subtract. This is how much oil you removed. Replace this with the same amount of clarified butter, also called ghee.\n\n#Taste & Texture:\n1. The texture is incredible, easily scoopable even immediately out of the freezer, even with just a room temperature spoon. The ingredients really do a fantastic job here, emulsifying the fat from the pecans and stabilizing the air in the ice cream.\n2. The pecan superpremium ice cream is very much a pecan lover's ice cream. The gelato is more mild and lower in fat. Butter pecan superpremium ice cream is a balance between the mild flavor of the gelato with the rich taste of the superpremium ice cream.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j33wfj", "created_utc": 1741066829.0, "score": 34, "author": "Taric250", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1j33wfj/pecan_gelato_or_superpremium_ice_cream_with_or/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

However, if I take the 50g of sugar and apply the same formula to compute the dextrose, it's 50g x 1.43 = **71.5g dextrose.** This is a big difference! Which is correct? I'm know it's related to the difference in the 1T weight of each, but I can't figure out which is right.

{"title": "How To Make Ice Cream More Solid", "selftext": "The base recipe I found searching online was exceptionally simple (1+1/2 cup heavy cream, 1+1/2 cup whole milk, half cup of sugar, tablespoon of vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon of salt). For vanilla and chocolate chip, those two batches came out at a perfect consistency.\n\nFor some of my experiments though (Suntory Toki + Peanutbutter Cups, or gatorade powder + M&M's), I found that it stayed VERY soft no matter how long it was in the freezer. Like, I can scoop it, it's not soup, and it holds its form for a surprisingly long time before actualy melting, but it's really not an ice cream texture. (once it hits the bowl it immediately flattens from scoop shape to kind of what you'd expect non-canned whipped cream to do)\n\nI know alcohol can prevent freezing, so I'm assuming that was my issue on the Toki batch, but I'm less sure what went wrong on the gatorade batch.\n\nOnce thing I realized this week that I suspect might be part of my problem, is that I wasn't putting in enough cream/milk, so my ratios might be off and fixing that might solve problem. (I was using a liquid measuring cup I picked up in Japan when traveling, and didn't realize \"1 cup\" in Japan and \"1 cup\" in America weren't the same thing, so the measuring cup I was using says 1 cup is only 200mL rather than 240mL)\n\nAre there any other things other than more cream/milk that might make it a little more solid if addressing that doesn't get it where it needs to be? Not looking for a brick, but would like something that could keep it's shape (and maybe at some point be used to make an ice cream cake)\n\nIf relevant, my maker is a Whynter ICM-201SB, and I just turn it on and hit go with the default settings (60 minutes)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1iwfo7s/how_to_make_ice_cream_more_solid/", "created_utc": 1740332466.0, "score": 5, "author": "reaper527", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1iwfo7s/how_to_make_ice_cream_more_solid/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Quick freezing while hand stirring", "selftext": "This will be long winded, but I couldn\u2019t find anything about it anywhere in my searches maybe I\u2019m using the wrong keywords, but here goes : \n\nISSUE: I had a freezer bowl ice cream maker 20+ years ago. I probably used it five or six times before I gave up due to my dissatisfaction with the texture due to ice crystals. To justify a gadget that space intensive that can\u2019t closely match a commercial product wasn\u2019t worth it to me. \n\nHISTORY: I\u2019ve been quick freezing my fish at home for years (like 20) using a technique from an obscure book from 1980 basically emulating the chilled brine system that most small to medium fishing vessels have these days at least around here. This involves using a 23% salt solution chilled in the freezer just about to freezing. I usually wait till it\u2019s got a frozen surface and then I just break that up with solid frozen bottles of the same solution usually like 20 ounce Gatorade cause they\u2019re thick and they hold up to the stresses.  \nThen I take my freshly caught and vacuum sealed fish pieces and submerge them in the chilled brine with the frozen solid brine bottles weighting them down. This results in 1 inch or thinner pieces freezing rock solid in less than 30 minutes the surface freezes instantaneously. \n\nQUESTION: so the obvious question if you read all that is could I just take my metal bowl from my stand mixer and press it down in the chilled brine with solid brine bottle heat sinks, floating in that brine to emulate the classic rock salt and ice while whisking vigorously by hand and achieve a significantly or near-commercial level ice cream texture of do I need more air infusion through slower more measured freeze? \n\nYeah, this is probably over thought but that\u2019s what I do and I thought the details of my specific method would help and also if you like fish, this method will keep your fish crazy long like years if your freezer is subzero", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1ivnzwx/quick_freezing_while_hand_stirring/", "created_utc": 1740245291.0, "score": 2, "author": "fleedermouse", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1ivnzwx/quick_freezing_while_hand_stirring/", "html_title": ""}

What are the drawbacks and advantages of going with the compressor machine over splurging on the Ninja Creami?\n\nHere are a few specific questions I have:\n\n1. **Texture and Consistency:** Does one produce a better texture than the other?\n2. **Versatility:** Can a compressor machine handle the same variety of recipes (gelato, sorbet, frozen yogurt, etc.) as the Ninja Creami?\n3. **Ease of Use:** How do the two compare in terms of user-friendliness and cleanup?\n4. **Longevity and Durability:** Is the Ninja Creami built to last longer than a typical compressor machine?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your experiences and any advice you might have.

Lidl sells a \"Super Premium\" line of ice cream that is close to this consistency.\n\n\n\nLooking at the ingredients they use corn syrup **and** dextrose, as well as xanthan gum and guar gum in their mix.\n\n\n\nI've been making some ice cream at home, most of the time using the Salt and Straw base, and adding my choice of flavor.  I've done their goat cheese recipe, matcha, ube, chocolate and black sesame, and while they all turned out great, they freeze pretty hard.  The last batch I made I tried doubling that xanthan gum and adding more glucose, but it did not make a noticeable difference.\n\n  \nBrowsing through this subreddit one thing I think I need to try is cranking up the speed on my Kitchenaid to help incorporate more air.  Other than that, do I just need to use less sugar and more glucose?  Does using corn syrup with glucose have an added effect?  Does guar gum do anything different than xanthan gum?\n\n\n\nThank you for any insight you may have that will help me with this quest, this local shop I'm trying to mimic has been my favorite since I was a kid.

{"title": "Why? And how?", "selftext": "I see some are asking why their ice cream turn grainy or crumbly and so on.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief explanation. \n\nChunky ice cream:\nIf the ice cream visually looks coarse or feels chunky it\u2019s because you have cooked the eggs in your base to scrambled eggs. Temperature of your base was too high. Next time do not go over 85\u00b0c and make sure you add the eggs at 45\u00b0c while constantly whisking or mixing your base homogenizing the mixture as much as possible.\n\nFluffy ice cream:\nEven tho this texture sounds appealing. It\u2019s really not. The reason behind ice cream being fluffy can be because of low amount of solids, or high over run (too much air added to ice cream). This can also make ice cream melt faster.\nOther reason could be because of insufficient stabilizer.\n\nIcy ice cream ( you can say that five times).\nThis happens because it was either melted and re froze in freezer to to a breakdown or sudden temperature fluctuations.\nLow protein, or Low solids like milk fat, sugar, stabilizer and such. \nImmature aging ( not enough time to allow the ice cream to age).\nInsufficient homogenizing.\nSlow freezing.  \nAnd inaccurate freezer temperature. Best to store ice cream at room temperature-18\u00b0c for long term storage and at -11\u00b0c for short term storage. \n\nMelts too fast\nMalfunctions in freezer \nRoom is too warm\nNot enough solids \nNot enough stabilizer \n\nCrumbles \nToo much air \nNot enough eggs or stabilizer \nNot enough solids \n\nI hope this helps to improve your next batch.  Treat ice cream making as a science every thing matters.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1ikhi5t/why_and_how/", "created_utc": 1738998064.0, "score": 16, "author": "okiwali", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1ikhi5t/why_and_how/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Penn State - Ice Cream 101 Introduction to Frozen Desserts: Detailed Review", "selftext": "Last year when I was searching for information regarding Penn State\u2019s Ice Cream Short Course and/or Desserts 101, everything I saw had the experiences highly recommended but I could not find any specific details about the experience.\u00a0 Having just wrapped the Dessert 101 course this weekend, I wanted to share my feedback while the experience was fresh in the hopes that it will assist others in the future.\n\ntldr:\u00a0 Absolutely worth the time and money for the Dessert 101 Course if you:\n\n* Have made attempts at 8-10+ different homemade ice cream recipes so you know what success and failure looks like - (Cuisinart ICE or an old rock salt machine is perfectly fine or borrow something don\u2019t buy anything big for this).\n* Do some textbook reading beforehand so technical lectures won\u2019t be over your head.\n* Engage with the vendors and grab their contact info, even if still forming a concept.\n\nPrior to Attending:\n\nI have been fairly active in the kitchen for the last three years, first attending and later volunteering to assist as sous chef for classes at a local culinary center, covering cuisines all over the world - altogether about 500 hours of experience as an understudy for very experienced executive chefs in said commercial kitchen.\u00a0 Additionally most every Saturday for the last two years I have challenged myself to create either dish completely foreign to me or something familiar using a new cooking technique.\u00a0 This includes about a dozen reasonably successful ice creams starting from a French vanilla base, a couple of sub-par attempts at sorbet and gelato.\u00a0 Everything I\u2019ve attempted I\u2019ve captured the recipes along with complete notes and alterations so I know what to do (and not do) next time.\n\nI read chapters 1-4 and 7-9 of \u2018Ice Cream\u2019, Goff, 7th edition, from a PDF online.\u00a0 In retrospect chapters 5 and 10 would have  been helpful, but I ran out of time.\u00a0 My reading helped me significantly because the class was not the first time I was seeing these words and hearing these concepts; they had been previously introduced to me and Dr. Roberts and others were able to put the textbook information in context of what I as a small batch processor would actually use in the United States at present.\u00a0 I would consider those chapters required reading for anyone wanting to maximize their experience.\n\nRegistration and Travel:\n\nSign ups for the course opened up the morning of July 18th, 2024. I had checked the page \\*at least\\* every day since the first of June.\u00a0 The 7-day course was already full so I immediately signed up for the Ice Cream 101 course.\u00a0\n\nThe Monday of the week of the event, I received an email with the agenda attached.\n\nOn Thursday I flew in from KC to Pittsburgh, got a rental car and did the 2.5 hr drive to State College, PA without incident, arriving about 3:30pm local time.\u00a0 I stayed at the Hyatt off of Beaver Ave, but pretty much any hotel in the area is going to be within 10 minutes of the venue. There are also flight options to State College, PA itself (really!), Philadelphia, or Baltimore.\u00a0 Get your hotel early, college events scheduled that weekend may cause rooms to fill up closer to the date and prices may skyrocket.\n\nEvent Experience:\n\nRegistration was Friday, 11am at the Penn Stater.\u00a0 It\u2019s handled like any small conference event in a hotel, signed in at the registration table, got my swag and box lunch (sandwich, cookie, chips, fruit, drink) and headed to the assigned conference room.\u00a0 All class materials and slides, probably around 150 pages, are given out in a large 3-ring binder.\n\nThe room held 100 people, there were a little over 75 attendees on the contact info sheet with 7-8 staff members/presenters and 7-8 speakers and vendors in attendance.\u00a0 Of those 75 people, 17 states were represented and several countries including Japan, China, Mexica, Singapore.\u00a0 Most of the US attendees\u00a0 were within 300 miles of PA.\u00a0 Everyone gave a brief 45-60 second introduction, while there were some people that were new to ice cream making and there to learn, most either owned or had stated plans to own a restaurant, coffee shop, or ice cream shop and were looking to gain skills.\u00a0 Several had been in business for quite a few years and were looking to hone their skills in the interest of continuing education.\u00a0 There were a few dairy farm owners that were seeking to make the jump to ice cream manufacture.\n\nThe first day\u2019s reception event was reasonably well attended, I met a few contacts and am glad I stayed. \u00a0 Also, there were three ice creams available to sample - Peachy Paterno, Raspberry Torte, Death by Chocolate.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have any official Berkey Creamery after that, but had about 10-14 other flavor samples during labs, not counting the 10-12 vanilla and chocolate samples in the tasting lab.\n\nCourse Content:\n\n(not including lunch/breaks)\n\nFirst day was 5 hrs of lecture.\u00a0\n\nSecond day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.\n\nThird day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.\u00a0\n\nFor labs, the class was split up into three groups of approximately\u00a0 25 people each.\n\nSession topics included: Ice Cream Overview, Composition, Ice Cream Operation, Ingredients, Fresh Fruit, Mix Processing, Make Your Own Mix?, Flavors and Inclusions, Self Serve and Fresh Serve, Gelato, Entrepreneurial Topic, Freezing and Hardening, Post Freezing and Customer Engagement, Non-Dairy Desserts, Equipment Choices, Choosing Mix Suppliers, and Food Regulations.\n\nLab Exercises/Demonstration topics included: Soft Serve/Direct Draw machine maintenance and use, alcohol freezing, handheld treats, and Batch Freezers types and use with ice creams, gelatos and custards, ice cream formulations (taste testing 10-11 different samples and judging respective quality, defects, etc.)\n\nI am sure the above is subject to change based on need and speaker availability.\u00a0 Class flow was excellent and modules built on each other with little to no overlap on topics.\u00a0 Dr. Roberts ran a tight ship, this entire event was on time to the minute.\u00a0 Class attendees asked great questions, no one got off topic or meandered into any side discussions.\u00a0\n\nPersonal Notes:\n\nI'm glad I did the 101 course, it was stated during the sessions that the primary difference between the 101 and the 7-day short course was days of additional content (and presumably labs) on each individual ingredient and mix formulation.\u00a0 While the labs would have been fun, the lecture would have not been useful to me as someone not employed by a large-scale manufacturer.\n\nI was not at the point where I had a defined concept and business plan, so I was not quite ready to establish formal relationships with vendors and suppliers.\u00a0 But I took down everyone\u2019s information, am sending thank you emails now and will follow up when my plans have \u2018hardened,\u2019 pun intended.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this course did accomplish all of my personal goals: I will be digging deeper into the regulations around starting my own small business, reaching out to local commissaries to inquire about capabilities in hosting me as a startup, getting my own at-home blast freezer, developing relationships with my restaurant contacts to get placement in their venues, and putting together an ice cream class that I myself will teach where I\u2019ve previously been volunteering.  So very successful all around.\n\nHope the above write-up was helpful; best of luck to future classes and attendees.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1igbyao/penn_state_ice_cream_101_introduction_to_frozen/", "created_utc": 1738541689.0, "score": 89, "author": "jt15550", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1igbyao/penn_state_ice_cream_101_introduction_to_frozen/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Dark chocolate ice cream - review of available recipes", "selftext": "# Intro\n\nI've been thinking recently a lot about *\"Dark Chocolate Ice Cream\"*. This is my favorite ice cream style. At some point I started comparing recipes and they turned out unexpectedly different. I wanted to share the comparison with you.\n\n# Updates:\n\nAfter writing this article, I updated the table with more recipes. Some of the text below may be outdated because of that.\n\n# What is dark chocolate?\n\nBefore we get to ice cream, what is \"dark chocolate\"? Reddit is a multi-cultural place after all and the definition that I'm used to may not be universal. While writing this post I did some research and it seems that the worldwide reality is...complex.\n\n* I used to think that \"over 70%\" cocoa solids is considered dark,\n* A few countries have labeling requirements for that, they all say that chocolate must have \"at least 35% cocoa solids\". Others don't have requirements specific to \"dark\", so \"dark\" chocolate equals \"chocolate\" there. It often means that the requirement is even weaker,\n* I've seen various people expressing their own definitions ranging from 50% to 100%.\n\nI will keep using my definition but without pretension of it being more or less right than any other. I like it and it's not far from many others so it may mislead some...but few.\n\n# What is dark chocolate ice cream?\n\nTo me, the intuitive definition would be *\"ice cream that tastes like dark chocolate\"*.  \nBut...I've tried a few chocolate ice creams. I've tried a few dark chocolates. These experiences don't match. Every chocolate ice cream recipe that I've tried is sweet. Dark chocolate is either barely sweet or not at all. Furthermore, most dark chocolate ice cream recipes call for milk ingredients, which is rare (but not unheard of) in the world of dark chocolate.\n\nThis discrepancy has led me to a thought that it would be useful to look at the sweetness-bitterness balance. In simple chocolate that is just cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and sugar, the balance is easy and correlates well with cocoa content. Knowing cocoa content we can have a good idea of how sweet a chocolate is (as long as there are no additives like milk). What if we calculated the sweetness-bitterness balance of ice cream? And from the balance, calculated back to \"as sweet as X% chocolate\"? Would that be a useful as an ice cream parameter? I think that it won't work as well as with chocolate, but nevertheless I feel it is the best single parameter that comes to my mind. I will now call this sweetness-bitterness balance \"Theoretical chocolate %\".\n\n# How to calculate Theoretical Chocolate % ?\n\nFirst, sum up cocoa-solids-nonfat (CSNF) of the cocoa and chocolate products in your recipe. Express that as % of the total recipe weight.  \nThen calculate sweetness as % of sucrose.  \nFrom my ingredients database it seems that typical chocolate has 46% CSNF and 54% cocoa butter, calculated as a percentage of cocoa solids (not as a percentage of the entire bar). I use that for the theoretical chocolate.  \nWith that, the theoretical chocolate percentage = (100/46\\*CSNF)/(sweetness+(100/46\\*CSNF))\\*100\n\nBTW, I did not correct for the fact that we tend to eat ice cream cold and chocolate at room temperatures. This affects sweetness perception. Temperature alone will make ice cream feel less sweet than chocolate of equivalent %. I would like to make this correction but I don't know how to.\n\n# What other properties affect ice cream taste?\n\nDark chocolate ice cream recipes differ in more than just sweetness-to-bitterness ratio. A few other significant properties are:\n\n* Amount of cocoa. Or precisely, cocoa solids nonfat (CSNF) which is the flavoring ingredient. You can have ice cream that's very sweet and very chocolatey at the same time. At the extreme, chocolate ice cream can taste far more chocolatey than chocolate itself (due to faster spread of cocoa solids in the mouth). Some like this effect (I do). Most prefer their ice cream to be milder.\n* What exact chocolate and cocoa do you use...but this is typically your choice, not the recipe author's.\n* Amount of milk ingredients. It's a big deal as well, there are sorbets with no milk at all and ice creams that are indeed very milky. I am not sure whether all milk ingredients matter to the same extent. I decided to focus on milk-solids-nonfat (MSNF) as its a close analogy to CSNF. But maybe it would be better to think about milk-solids-including-fat instead? I don't know. Anyway....I decided to look as a MSNF-to-CSNF ratio as it has more impact on taste than MSNF alone.\n* Other flavoring ingredients. Vanilla, nuts, chilli, coffee, cherry, banana, raisins, salt, cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, rum, rosemary, mustard, smoke, garlic just to name a few. That's too much to cover for me, so I will mostly ignore this topic now.\n* Fat percent, total solids affect mouthfeel. The former also affect flavor release (higher fat ice cream will be less intense but the flavor will last longer). Am I missing something important?\n\n# The recipes table\n\nIn the table below you can see a summary of a few recipes that I selected. I focused on the ones labelled dark and the ones that just have a lot of cocoa in them, but I didn't limit myself to them. Similarly I focused on the recipes that I've seen recommended, but I did not limit myself to them. One caveat of this table is that the recipes are not pure math as the ingredients have some variability. One notable decision is that unless the authors were precise in the chocolate % recommendations, I assumed that dark chocolate meant 90%, bittersweet 70%, semisweet 50%. YMMV. Don't treat this table as absolute truth, more like a ballpark.\n\n|Author|Recipe|Theo chocolate %|CSNF %|MSNF/CSNF|Fat %|Total Solids %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Taric250|[Chocolate Gelato](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1jql6fa/chocolate_gelato_recipe_calculated_written_and/)|65|10.9|0.94|3.9|42|\n|Underbelly|[\u201cSingle Origin\u201d Chocolate Ice Cream](https://under-belly.org/ice-cream-flavor-chocolate/)|59|8.8|0.93|15|46|\n|Underbelly|[\u201cDouble Origin\u201d Chocolate Ice Cream](https://under-belly.org/ice-cream-flavor-chocolate/)|58|9|0.55|15.5|43.1|\n|Max Falkovitz|[The Darkest Dark Chocolate](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-dark-chocolate-ice-cream-recipe)|54-61|7.5-9.5|0.67-0.5|11-12.6|38.7-41.2|\n|David Lebovitz|[Chocolate Sorbet](https://food52.com/recipes/17877-david-lebovitz-s-chocolate-sorbet)|51|12.1|0|7.1|44.4|\n|Marie Asselin|[Dark Chocolate Gelato](https://foodnouveau.com/dark-chocolate-gelato/)|50|7.7|0.66|12.5|41.8|\n|Pacojet|[Chocolate Sorbet Vegan](https://pacojet.com/en-GB/Recipes/Ice-cream-and-sorbet/Chocolate-Sorbet-Vegan/)|49|10.7|0|6.7|38.8|\n|Stella Parks|[Devil\u2019s Food](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/devils-food-chocolate-ice-cream-recipe-bravetart-stella-parks/)|48|9.1|0.37|18.8|54.5|\n|Katie Bracco / ihavetities|[Chocolate with Kidney Beans](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1f93pzo/i_tried_the_chocolate_with_kidney_beans_recipe/)|47|5|0|2.8|27.7|\n|Humphry Slocombe|[Chocolate Smoked Salt Ice Cream](https://honestcooking.com/chocolate-smoked-salt-ice-cream/)|47|6.5|0.55|19.9|47|\n|buttermilkbysam|[Midnight Chocolate Ice Cream](https://buttermilkbysam.com/midnight-chocolate-ice-cream/)|47|6.8|0.68|19|46.6|\n|Pacojet|[Chocolate Ice Cream](https://pacojet.com/en-GB/Recipes/Ice-cream-and-sorbet/Chocolate-Ice-Cream/)|43|7.6|0.47|21|52.9|\n|Siliquy8|[Dark chocolate gelato](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/148psj7/dark_chocolate_gelato/)|40|7|0.69|10.4|45.2|\n|iahoover|[Uber dark chocolate](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1donoo2/uber_dark_chocolate/)|39|5.6|1.6|11.8|45.9|\n|Ruben Porto|[Chocolate Ice Cream](https://www.icecreamscience.com/blog/chocolate-ice-cream-recipe)|36|4.3|2.5|19.8|46.8|\n|Jeni Britton-Bauer|[The Darkest Chocolate Ice Cream in the World](https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/The-Darkest-Chocolate-Ice-Cream-in-the-World/)|35|4.8|1.15|10.9|40.2|\n|Laura|[Best Homemade Chocolate Ice Cream](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/chocolate-ice-cream/)|34|4.8|0.88|20.7|49.7|\n|Sweetlo123|[The Best Chocolate Ice Cream of My (and possibly your) Life](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1gw1vp9/the_best_chocolate_ice_cream_of_my_and_possibly/)|33|4.3|1.56|14.9|47.9|\n|Sweetlo123|[Chocolate Frozen Yogurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hxlveo/chocolate_frozen_yogurt/)|31|4.6|1.3|15.3|49.3|\n|Morgan Bolling|[Dark Chocolate No-Churn Ice Cream](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/11755-dark-chocolate-no-churn-ice-cream)|19|3.4|2.1|21.9|61.7|\n\n# Some high level summary:\n\n* Judging by sweetness-to-bitterness, I will call the darkest ice cream recipes I've seen bittersweet. I haven't seen a single one I would classify as dark.\n* Regardless of what property you look at, the range of values here is very high. There are huge differences between recipes and recommendations mean little in the sense that I suspect that whatever recipe you  take, some will consider it awful. If you're a newbie to chocolate ice cream making and make a random recommended recipe, you may hate it. If that happens, don't worry. There are surely others that you will find more appealing and the table above may guide you in the right direction.\n\n# Comments about recipes\n\n1. Underbelly has a couple of recipes, one based on cocoa powder and the other on chocolate with added cocoa. These recipes are the darkest by the sweetness-bitterness ratio. Sweetness is relatively low, cocoa content is relatively high but both parameters are far from extreme. One thing that surprised me was that they are very different from each other when it comes to milk content. I have no idea why.\n2. Max Falkovitz's \"The Darkest Dark Chocolate\". Oh boy, this guy can write. But if I see a promise of \"the darkest chocolate\" for \"the hardcore chocolate fans\", I expect it to be like...dark chocolate. And not just just barely dark but close to 100% dark. This one doesn't seem dark. Not even barely dark, just bittersweet. Max, you have disappointed me. That said, this recipe is quite unique in that it uses cocoa brew (it cooks cocoa nibs in milk and them removes them). I am unable to predict the extraction yield as well or amount of milk removed with the nibs, that's why you see a range. I have a hunch that the actual numbers are closer to those on the left. Another noteworthy feature is the amount of salt. Max likes his chocolate salty.\n3. David Lebovitz's sorbet is...interesting. Extreme amount of cocoa. No milk to make it milder. But also extreme sweetness. Overall, very intense bittersweet flavor.\n4. Katie Bracco made a recipe that became popular in the ninjacreami sub. I was unable to calculate its properties reasonably well. But for a variant made by ihavetities I could. And I did. It turned out as having extremely low fat and solids content (no wonder for a low calorie recipe). Not much cocoa, but not much sweetness either which made it indeed relatively dark.\n5. Jeni's \"The darkest chocolate in the world\". For me, it's a fascinating recipe. Fascinating, because the name is very misleading, it's not dark by any measure that comes to my mind but nevertheless it's recommended a lot. And people indeed say it's dark. Are used to very mild chocolates or is there an element of suggestion? I don't know. Regardless, there are 2 noteworthy features. It uses cream cheese as emulsifier, a technique that Jeni pioneered and others picked up. It is also relatively low fat, more like gelato than ice cream from the USA.\n6. Morgan Bolling's \"Dark Chocolate No-Churn Ice Cream\" is the most extreme chocolate ice cream by so many metrics. The highest sweetness, by a significant margin. The highest total solids. The highest fat content. And the lowest amount of cocoa. If I didn't calculate it I wouldn't believe people make ice cream with so much sugar and fat. And I wouldn't believe they call them \"dark chocolate\". But apparently they do.\n\n# Final word\n\nIf you've made this far...any comments or suggestions?  \nWhere in this range does your favorite dark chocolate ice cream fall?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1icobii/dark_chocolate_ice_cream_review_of_available/", "created_utc": 1738134888.0, "score": 34, "author": "Civil-Finger613", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1icobii/dark_chocolate_ice_cream_review_of_available/", "html_title": ""}

Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker. Turn on the machine. Churn just until the mixture has the texture of soft-serve (timing ranges, depending on the machine).\nQuickly transfer the ice cream to freezer-friendly containers: Spoon in a layer of ice cream, sprinkle on the almond brittle and salted ganache, and use a spoon to press them in gently. Repeat.\nCover with parchment paper, pressing it to the surface of the ice cream so it adheres, then cover with a lid. It\u2019s okay if the parchment hangs over the rim. Store it in the coldest part of your freezer (farthest from the door) until firm, at least 6 hours. It will keep for up to 2 months.\nAlmond Brittle:\n\nLine a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\nCombine the sugar, corn syrup, and \u00bc cup water in a medium saucepan and stir until all of the sugar looks wet. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the syrup comes to a simmer, about 3 minutes.\nContinue to cook, this time covered and without stirring, until the mixture has thickened slightly, about 3 more minutes. Add the butter and salt, and stir well. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and continue to cook, gently and constantly stirring, until the mixture registers 290\u00b0F on the thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the heat, and quickly but thoroughly stir in the almonds, baking soda, and vanilla (watch it all bubble!), doing your best to distribute the nuts throughout the sticky mixture. Immediately (like, super quick!) pour the mixture onto the lined sheet pan and use a butter knife or a metal spatula to spread it out to a relatively even layer that\u2019s just under \u00bc inch thick. Let the brittle sit uncovered until it has cooled to room temperature, about 1 hour. Then use your hands to break it into irregular bite-size (about \u00bc- to \u00bd-inch) pieces.\nStore them in an airtight container in the freezer until you\u2019re ready to use them as a mix-in (or to simply eat them) for up to 3 months. There\u2019s no need to defrost the pieces before using them in the ice cream\n\nSalted Ganache:\nCombine the cream and sugar in a medium saucepan, stir well, and bring the mixture to a bare simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate and salt, and let it sit, stirring and scraping the pan occasionally, until the chocolate begins to melt, about 2 minutes.\nUse a sturdy whisk to vigorously stir until the chocolate has completely melted and the mixture becomes smooth and satiny, about 1 minute. Congratulations, you just made ganache!\n\nTransfer the ganache to an airtight container and store it in the freezer for at least 2 hours or up to 1 month. There\u2019s no need to defrost it before using. \n\nIce Cream Base:\n\nCombine the sugar, dry milk, and xanthan gum in a small bowl and stir well. Pour the corn syrup into a medium pot and stir in the whole milk. Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary, to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.\n\nAdd the cream and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours. Stir the base back together if it separates during the resting time. The base can be further stored in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

{"title": "Icy Gelato Help (has butter) Toffee Flavor", "selftext": "First let me start of by saying that I normally don't have any problem with my gelato being icy. Gelato in particular is kind of my specialty. But with this latest flavor, the texture was not the velvety smooth gelato that I'm used to. I should also mention that I almost always use a custard base, and did with this one. I like to use simple ingredients. Sugar (typical store bought white sugar), milk, cream, egg yolks, and a pinch of salt. That's all I use for my base. Again, never had any issue with ice so I know my base ratios are good. \n\nSo where does this recipe differ from my standard recipe? I wanted to make a toffee flavor. I achieved this by melting butter and mixing in light *brown* sugar (the normal weight for my base) then kept stirring until my toffee just barely hit 350F and I then poured the milk and cream directly onto the toffee to quickly cool it. I've used this same method to make caramel flavored ice cream (replacing the butter with water and brown sugar with white) to great success which gave me confidence with this method. My experience making caramel ice cream taught me that the caramel loses sweetness (I think because the sugar is becoming- not sugar anymore) so I added in more brown sugar (via making a custard of sugar and egg yolks). Knowing that I'd be adding in extra fat because this recipe uses butter, I calculated how much milk I could add (no cream) to arrive at the same fat % as my normal base. Flavor wise, I think this was actually a success. I got a strong toffee flavor and the sweetness level was good so I think I added in the right amount of sugar.\n\n I'm not really sure why the texture didn't work out. Again, the fat % and sweetness levels are the same as my normal base. The only things I can think of are:\n1. Maybe brown sugar isn't as good for the texture as white sugar so, I need to add more brown sugar or swap out some of the brown with white (which I'd rather not do since the flavor was delicious).\n2. Maybe because the butter is being turned into toffee, the fat isn't actually fat anymore so, my fat % is lower than what I'm calculating. Problem is, I have no idea how much fat I'm losing. Is it 20%? 100%? This is probably what I will try changing first, by replacing some of the milk with cream. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience making similar recipes?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1i67jew/icy_gelato_help_has_butter_toffee_flavor/", "created_utc": 1737424358.0, "score": 1, "author": "Trollselektor", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1i67jew/icy_gelato_help_has_butter_toffee_flavor/", "html_title": ""}

Luscious chocolate ice cream paired with toasty walnuts and mini marshmallows (pictured here) or homemade marshmallow fluff (recipe included). Happy New Year all! Let me know if you have any questions! \n\nSweet Lo\u2019s Rocky Road\n\nYield: about 1.5 quarts \n\n1 \u00bd cup (357g) heavy cream\n3 tbsp (22.5g) cocoa powder \n\u2154 cup / 5 ounces (142g) semi-sweet + bittersweet chocolate chips*\n1 \u00bd cup (368g) whole milk \n\u00bc cup (33g) nonfat dry milk powder \n\u2154 cup + 1 tbsp (150g) white sugar \n\u00bd tsp (2.6g) salt \n3 (54g) egg yolks\n\u00bc tsp (1.1g) good quality vanilla extract \n\n*I use 3.6oz (102g) semi-sweet chips (43%) + 1.4oz (40g) bittersweet chips (63%). Feel free to adjust these levels to your liking. \n\n3oz (85g) toasted walnuts (recipe below)\n\n1 cup (about 55g) mini marshmallows \n\nAND / OR\n\n 1 \u00bd cups (weigh) homemade marshmallow fluff (recipe below)\n\nBefore starting, set aside a medium sized bowl (one with a lid) with a fine mesh strainer on top.\n\n1. In a medium-sized, heavy bottom saucepan add the heavy cream, cocoa powder and (both) chocolate chips. Heat on medium low, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and the cocoa is incorporated.\n2. Pour this mixture into the medium-sized bowl and set a mesh strainer on top of it.\n3. In the same saucepan (do not clean out!) add the whole milk, nonfat milk powder, sugar and salt. Heat on medium low, stirring occasionally, until the dry ingredients have incorporated into the milk.\n4. While the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and put the yolks in a small bowl. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\n5. Once the milk mixture is combined and all the ingredients are incorporated, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn the heat to medium. \n6. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, registering about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer. This will take about 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer into the heavy cream / chocolate mixture and give a good stir. Allow the base to cool at room temperature for an hour. Stir in the vanilla extract.\n7. Add the lid to the bowl and set in the refrigerator to age overnight.\n8. Toast your walnuts and make your marshmallow fluff, if you are using. \n9. When you are ready to churn, pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.\n10. To assemble your Rocky Road Ice Cream: Scoop your churned chocolate ice cream from the ice cream maker into a medium sized bowl. Quickly stir in your toasted walnuts and mini marshmallows. Scoop into your container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nIf you are using marshmallow fluff: Scoop your churned chocolate ice cream from the ice cream maker into a medium sized bowl. Quickly stir in the toasted walnuts. Next, dollop spoonfuls of it over the chocolate / walnut ice cream and get some of the fluff along with some ice cream on the paddle as you scoop it into your container. Repeat this process, adding more fluff as you go, to your liking. Once complete, cover the container with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nToasted Walnuts \nYield: about \u2154 cup walnuts \n\nPlace \u2154 cup raw walnuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and toast at 350 degrees for 6 minutes. After 6 minutes, take the walnuts out and sprinkle them generously with salt. Give the walnuts a shake, rotate the pan and toast for an additional 3 minutes. When they are toasty and fragrant smelling, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool completely. Give them a rough chop before placing them in a jar until ready to use. \n\nMarshmallow Fluff\nYield: about 1 \u00be cups fluff \n\n3 (126g) egg whites\n\u00be cup (150g) white sugar\n\u00bc tsp (1.1g) cream of tartar\nSplash of vanilla extract \n\nWhisk the egg whites and sugar for 2-3 minutes in a double boiler or a nonreactive bowl set over a small pot of simmering water.\nAs soon as the sugar is fully dissolved into the egg whites and the mixture is warm, transfer to a bowl of a stand mixer.\nWhisk on medium high speed for about 2 minutes, then add in the cream of tartar and splash of vanilla extract, just when the egg whites are turning from translucent to opaque. \nContinue whisking for an additional 5-7 minutes, making a thick, stiff marshmallow fluff. \nTransfer marshmallow fluff to a jar with a lid and keep at room temperature until ready to use, up to two weeks. \nGet ready to dollop spoonfuls of fluff into your churned chocolate + walnut ice cream. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y5sic0n62p9e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1735437330.0, "score": 104, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1holazg/classic_rocky_road/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Ice cream newbie- some UK help please :)", "selftext": "Hi, \nI've been making ice cream since April. I've got a cuisinart ICE150,and have mainly used web based recipes and then adapted them intuitively for different ingredients. Everything so far has worked out really well and been well received. I've had people who don't usually like ice cream asking for batches because they've finally had one they like. \nI bought HMNIIC and made a few of the mix ins/ sauces. To be honest, I wasn't massively impressed with them flavour wise, but I wasn't sure if that's maybe because some of our flavours are quite distinctively different in the UK, compared to the US. \nPreviously, I've not used any stabilisers and all my recipes have been custard based. I've started experimenting (as per recipe) with the ones in the book and they all seem to result in curdled ice cream. Making my usual recipes, I don't get any splitting or bits of yolk in my finished base, but I seem to be getting these greasy looking bases which just don't look as good as my usual bases do. I've been playing with the philly style ice creams too, and they also look gross- like thin and weird as if you've mixed soft cream cheese and icing sugar. I'm batch making a load for Christmas presents (maybe not the time to have been trying new recipes!) so haven't churned any yet, but I'm wary of what they're going to be like. I'm really hoping I haven't just wasted 4 days in the kitchen  \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nI tried to compare my usual recipes to the functional ratios in the back of the book and some seem quite different. I'm aware that there's a difference between UK / US heavy cream (we call it double here, and it's about 50% bf). I'm wondering if there are other differences too, which might have an impact. \n\nFinally, when it comes to adding fruit, I'm using the bubblegum recipe as the basis for a cherry ice cream, but the functional ratios, whilst being intended to allow the reader to use the formula to make any ice cream from scratch, doesn't really give any info on how you account for water content of a puree, or the fruit sugar content (or does that not matter?). \n\nAny light that can be shed would be appreciated :) thanks! \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hkzyaq/ice_cream_newbie_some_uk_help_please/", "created_utc": 1734995310.0, "score": 2, "author": "Ellabee83", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1hkzyaq/ice_cream_newbie_some_uk_help_please/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Finding the best vanilla bean paste for ice cream", "selftext": "This is less of a recipe and more of an exploration, although I hope it's still okay to post in this category; it's what I was looking for when I first got started. I use a 2:1 ratio of cream to milk but I don't think the base ratio matters too much.  The important part is that I added the pastes into my base once it had cooled to room temperature.\n\nMy goal is to perfect my vanilla recipe. Picard used to carry this jaundice-yellow vanilla ice cream and it tasted like magic but they discontinued it (to spite me) and I can never forgive them. But now I'm an adult with an ice cream maker and a vengeance, so here we are.\n\nVanilla, despite being so common and banal is such a wierd, interesting, impossible product. However (and despite evidence below to the contrary), I'm not made of money so I'm starting with pastes. The speckles do something for me that's hard to explain.\n\nEnter \\[stage left\\] the pastes:\n\n1. Trader Joe's Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste\n2. Trader Joe's Organic Vanilla Bean Paste\n3. Simply Organic Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste\n4. Blue Cattle Truck Trading Co. Mexican Vanilla Bean Paste\n5. Tahitian Gold 3-Bean Blend Whole Vanilla Bean Paste\n6. Heilala Pure Vanilla Paste\n7. Nielson Massey Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nBefore I go into each, the biggest thing I noticed about working with pastes is that they have a lot of added sugar. That means if you don't want things too sweet (like me) you're going to need to compensate. The bottles rarely have the amount of sugar per serving in grams so you might need to look that up. I found that I had to overcompensate but that might be because I use organic sugar which is less sweet in my experience.\n\nOnline vanilla reviews tend to focus around them in baked goods which doesn't translate well to ice cream where we're not challenging the flavor with heat. Anytime a vanilla was described as \"subtle\" or \"weak\" by reviewers, the better suited I thought it might be for ice cream.\n\n# Trader Joe's Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nThis is the one that started the journey. It was letting me down and I craved something better. But when I measure it out and add it in, it gloops together like a cartoon rain drop and doesn't stick to the spoon which is 10/10.\n\n# Trader Joe's Organic Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nSolid. I liked this best when I matched it with a tablespoon of dark rum. If you're here for the reasonable recommendation that's not too expensive, generally pleasing, and is easy to get (assuming you live near a Trader Joe's) this is it. For the rest of us annoying folks, I will move on.\n\n# Simply Organic Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nThis is a great choice if you're having people over and you want to flex on them that you make ice cream from scratch now. This one was the most delicious straight out of the ice cream maker and still good \\~24 hours later. However, it did lose its flavor after about 36-48 hours. You also need to be careful of how much you put in. When I tried to overcompensate for its subtle flavor, I found it tasted \"fake\" which I think means I could taste the additives they put in to give it the gloop. Even when not overcompensating, you have to use a lot and it's not a large container and it's kind of expensive...\n\n# Blue Cattle Truck Trading Co. Mexican Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nThe vanilla bean plant is from Mexico and that's the only place with the native bees that pollinate it. Other (\\*cough\\* french-colonized \\*cough\\*) countries that grows this has to hand-pollinate it in order to get it to grow the bean. It's no wonder the bean itself is expensive but still incredible how common it is.\n\nThis tastes like candy more than vanilla. One person said it tasted like cotton candy, but I think it tastes like marshmallows, but like marshmallows from the 1950s when I wasn't even alive. It was also very sweet even after reducing the sugar a lot. It's good if you're into that kind of thing, but suspicious for implanting false memories.\n\n# Tahitian Gold 3-Bean Blend Whole Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nGoddamit I was trying to buy a pure Tahitian vanilla bean paste and didn't read the listing well enough. This combines beans from Tahiti, Madagascar, and Papua New Guinea. Madagascar vanilla beans are incredibly musky and strong which means they're great for baking (musk reduces in heat) but using it raw in ice cream gives you full-on musk which (imo) distracts from the \"actual\" vanilla flavor. That's why I was trying to get Tahitian vanilla beans which tend to be more subtle. This one wasn't too musky but it would have been less so...if I could read!\n\nThis is very bourbon-y (as advertised). It tasted better when added 1:1 with a bourbon-y dark rum that further brought out its bourbon-y-ness. This tasted slightly bitter straight out of the machine but mellowed out beautifully after 24 hours curing.\n\nOut of all these pastes, this one actually smelled like actual vanilla bean, which made me think it's higher quality but \"has smelled vanilla beans\" is my only credential to judge this so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n# Heilala Pure Vanilla Paste\n\nThis one marketed to my millenial heart but while I appreciate the company's dedication to the Kingdom of Tonga, the product itself is only okay. It's a solid pick but the flavor seemed to disappear quickly, similar to the Simply Organics without beating it in terms of initial deliciousness.\n\n# Nielson Massey Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nI tried this one after it came so highly recommended by commenters and I have it way too many chances since it was literally everyone's favorite. My honest opinion, particularly compared with others on this list, is that it's fine. I might actually prefer the Heilala. The brand just seems to have a choke hold on this subreddit in a very guerilla marketing kind of way.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFor me, there was no clear winner and so I will likely continue trying out different ones and posting updates. However, I still have 5 varyingly full containers of vanilla paste and an objectively good sense of fun so I thought the best way to find a winner would be for them to fight it out.\n\nI assumed mixing all 5 pastes would result in something I could describe only as \"vanilla\" but, surprisingly, you can really taste the different pastes. The flavor was constantly changing throughout the churning process. Although the Mexican vanilla along with the Trader Joe's Bourbon stood out at the very beginning, by the time I was done churning the Tahitian Gold really took the lead supported by the Simply Organics and Heilala. After a few hours of curing, the Mexican vanilla came back in with a vengeance only to be beaten out by...no one. What I'm saying is that I didn't like the Mexican vanilla one that much and it comes off far too strong in ice cream. I should have known when I saw how people praised it online. In retrospect, perhaps I was actualy looking for the loser in the fight or maybe second last. Anyways, the search continues...\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nVanilla Bean paste is just not a good option for ice cream. The extra gunk and sugar they put in there to give it the goop comes through far too clearly and there is no good option.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hjojcl/finding_the_best_vanilla_bean_paste_for_ice_cream/", "created_utc": 1734832013.0, "score": 14, "author": "DigitalAntagonist", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1hjojcl/finding_the_best_vanilla_bean_paste_for_ice_cream/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Toasted Milk Ice Cream- Need help with the milk powder", "selftext": "I'm currently using the Day with Mei recipe with personal adjustments to the base. Basically all i'm really taking from the recipe is the amount of milk powder used for 1qt and the sugar caramelization process.\n\nAnyhow, so far i've attempted this recipe twice, with both attempts having issues. The first attempt had GREAT flavor.... but was grainy due to the milk powder. So for the second attempt, I stirred together the milk and toasted milk powder separately on the stove, then strained it through a coffee filter. This left a bunch of grainy gunk which I assumed was the powder. I also assumed that even though this gunk was left behind, the flavor of the toasted milk still steeped into the milk: It did not. My ice cream ended up just tasting like caramel from the sugar caramelization step, with little to no toasted milk flavor. \n\nI'm not sure how to fix this powdered milk issue. My only theory is that the brand of powder is the issue, which i'm using the Saco Pantry brand (besides this brand, the only other brand at my store is a generic.) The next thing I can think of attempting is maybe letting the toasted milk powder steep in the milk overnight, though i'm not sure if that'll add much more flavor. \n\nDoes anyone have experience making this type of ice cream flavor? Any tips or advice? Thanks!\n\nEdit; also just checked and the powder is skim milk. Could this be the issue? The brand also sells a whole milk powder, would that be better?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hi6lol/toasted_milk_ice_cream_need_help_with_the_milk/", "created_utc": 1734652032.0, "score": 10, "author": "Mothered_", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1hi6lol/toasted_milk_ice_cream_need_help_with_the_milk/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Getting perfect structure and hardness in Italian gelato", "selftext": "Hi, I have been making a lot of different ice creams the past year and I am trying to perfect a vanilla gelato ice cream (with eggs in this case) I used this recipe from Angelo Corvitto's book:\n\nFull fat milk 547g\n35% cream 86g\nSkimmed milk powder 49g\nDextrose 148\nEgg yolks 100g\nSucrose 50g\nInverted sugar 20g\n\nFor a 1000g mix this is 8% fat. Using skimmed milk powder really seems like an improvement. I also added ~0.75g tara gum, even though the book only recommends stabilizer for recipes without eggs. The ice cream tasted great and had a very good texture and mouthfeel, but was just a bit too soft when coming out of the freezer.\n\nI measured my ice cream temperature and it is -15\u00b0C when stored. I realized the sugar content is relatively high which increases the freezing temperature and this may cause the softness. So, my first step will be to reduce the dextrose/sucrose ratio.\n\nThis is all clear, but what I am conflicted about is the added benefit (if there is) to using stabilizers. I am wondering if it can make the ice too soft if you already have eggs included. Some say that mainly freezing point determines the softness and stabilizer mainly improves other structural things. However I was thinking if it binds water it might also increase softness? Can anyone explain better? Does it have any added benefit to add stabilizers even when having eggs. Do you have a preference for tara, guar, xanthan...?\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1h7zslp/getting_perfect_structure_and_hardness_in_italian/", "created_utc": 1733486447.0, "score": 9, "author": "FitWind20", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1h7zslp/getting_perfect_structure_and_hardness_in_italian/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Inulin is making ice cream grainy and has caramelly off-taste", "selftext": "Hi! I've been using inulin in my sherbets lately at about 3% by weight, just to add a little bit of extra texture. \n\nBut the problem I've been encountering is that the inulin doesn't dissolve well in the base, and it adds a strong off taste, kinda like something it slightly burnt or like caramel (not in a good way). I am constantly stirring the pot to avoid burning anything, but this flavor is still here. It may just be part of the inulin and not from cooking it.\n\n  \nHas anyone else had this experience? My first guess is that both issues are from the inulin getting too much moisture in the bag I store it in, as it's clumped up quite a bit. That could have caused the taste to go off before the best-by date, and maybe also made it not dissolve well. Right?\n\nHere's the recipe I used most recently, but it's happening with everything I've used it in lately. I don't remember this happening when I first started using it, but I may be misremembering. \n\n* 270g milk\n* 100g heavy cream\n* 100g buttermilk\n* 120g sugar\n* 30g dextrose\n* 30g milk powder\n* 30g inulin\n\n  \nHeat all that until it comes to a simmer, then remove from heat and I added 3g black tea, steeped for 6 minutes, then strained.\n\n  \nThen, add the base from above to the following:\n\n* 270g persimmon puree\n* 2.5g citric acid\n* A generous pinch of salt\n\nThen I refrigerated overnight, added 1g guar gum, 0.5g xanthan gum via. blender, then churned.\n\n  \nBut the graininess and off-flavor was present while heating the base, before it even got to a simmer and before I added any fruit puree.\n\nThis is the brand I bought: [https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Naturals-Organic-Prebiotic-Smoothies/dp/B0BVC8HGNH/](https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Naturals-Organic-Prebiotic-Smoothies/dp/B0BVC8HGNH/)\n\n  \nShould I try another brand of inulin, or is it likely just moisture damage that caused it to go bad quickly?

{"title": "High Alcohol Ice Cream Troubleshooting", "selftext": "**Good Day Everyone!**\n\nBefore I start, for the  sake of this post, I'm going to us the term \"churn\" to refer to  the mixture thickening up and freezing  whilst the ice cream maker is...Churning away I guess.\n\nRecently I have been exploring high alcohol ice cream making, inspired by a company named Tipsy Scoops out of New York. Essentially they make really alcoholic ice cream, we're talking 5% or 10 proof for two scoops. I was kinda stunned  that the founder was able to  make ice cream with that much alcohol in it and still get the mixture to  churn. \n\nI have been giving it a shot with a few different flavours and  I'm experiencing  two issues -\n\n1 -  The mixture isint churning in my ice cream maker (Krups GVS-1). It stays liquid,  perhaps thickening a bit, but nowhere near actually resembling ice cream.\n\n2 -  The mixture does freeze when I pour it into a container and  chuck it into a traditional home freezer  but  I'm getting  an insane amount of icing, I'm talking a plethora of medium sized ice  crystals  throughout the frozen mixture.\n\nThe flavour is banging but the texture leaves a bit to be desired, so I'm trying to figure out exactly what the issue is, why I'm getting these issues and thats where I could use anyone's input.\n\n I'm thinking that because my mixture isint churning at  all,  that might be  the main culprit?\n\nI'm also  thinking that I'm making this stuff in summer, in South Africa so we're talking perhaps 26C at night 78F, perhaps hotter on occasion. So the ambient temp might  be playing havok with the much higher freezing point needed to freeze this stuff?\n\nI am kinda perplexed considering that amount of alcohol would obliterate any form of ice crystallization, I would think at least.\n\nThe woman who runs Tipsy Scoops has done some videos where she makes a  recipe in  a home ice cream maker and it seems to churn somewhat normally. I will see if I can link the video in the comments, but one can Google \"Tipsy Scoop\u2019s Founder Shows Us How to Make Boozy Ice-Cream at Home,\" and it should pop right up.\n\nI  have tried both her recipe and my recipe both have the same issues.\n\n**Tipsy Scoops Recipe -**\n\n1 \u00bd cups whole milk\n\n1 \u00bd cups heavy cream\n\n1 tablespoon vanilla\n\n1/3 cup sugar\n\n8 egg yolks\n\n6 cups Ice Cream Mix\n\n1/4 cup Cinnamon\n\n1 tablespoon Melted Butter\n\n1 cup Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum  (I used Bacardi White, its the same volume/proof)\n\n**And my recipe** (I have made this recipe, a orange Creamsicle with fresh juice and cream and a chocolate recipe which was mostly milk with cocoa powder, all have the same issue) -\n\n1Kg  Strawberries\n\n150ml cream\n\n80g Medium fat milk powder\n\n100g Pectin\n\n2g Xanthan gum\n\n70ml glucose\n\n100g white sugar\n\n100g invert sugar \n\n20ml lemon juice\n\n175ml Bacardi white rum 40 percent/80 proof \n\nPinch of salt\n\nLeave  to thicken up overnight and then churn the next day.\n\n\\-----\n\nWell theres my monolith of text, thank you for reading and thank you  to anyone who might be able  to help :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1h5ibhx/high_alcohol_ice_cream_troubleshooting/", "created_utc": 1733212007.0, "score": 6, "author": "DesignerAtoms", "num_comments": 47, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1h5ibhx/high_alcohol_ice_cream_troubleshooting/", "html_title": ""}

I decided to plug it into the Ice Cream Calculator so that I could get a quick overview, see if there was anything I might want to tweak right off the bat, and quickly scale the (1 qt?) recipe to my 4 qt machine. \n\nSubtract the strawberry chunk mix-in ingredients from the full ingredient list and you get a base comprised of:\n\n- 2 cups half and half*  \n- 0.75 cup sucrose  \n- 0.5 cup corn syrup  \n- 1.5 cups strawberry pur\u00e9e  \n- pinch of salt  \n\nIce Cream Calc throws out a lot of flags. Very low on fat. Rather low in total solids. Quite high in sugar/POD. \n\n*The fact that it uses half and half (which can legally contain anywhere from 10.5% to 18% milkfat) rather than specific amounts of milk and cream is also concerning me. I used the default half and half (12%) that was in the Ice Cream Calc database, for what it's worth (to get the overview - I haven't made it yet).\n\nFinally, Ice Cream Calc indicates that the mix volume *prior to churning* AND *prior to adding the strawberry chunks* is already a hair over 1 qt. Accounting for overrun and mix-ins, you're looking at an extra ~25% volume over what the recipe indicates it makes. So that's a little annoying, and I'm glad I plugged it into the calc. But, to be fair, not an indicator that the recipe isn't good or won't \"work\".\n\n__\n\nNow, I've definitely had some good ice cream that the Ice Cream Calc didn't \"like\". So I know it's just another tool in the kit and not something to religiously adhere to when your own tastebuds disagree with it.\n\nAnd, to the recipe's credit, the scoopability/serving temp metrics are looking good. So it shouldn't turn out a hard, frozen block nor a soupy mess that won't freeze. But I just wanted to get some input and thoughts from anyone who has tried the recipe. (My gut says just steal the sugar/alcohol-soaked berry chunks and put it  and the strawberry pur\u00e9e into a more familiar base.)\n\nOr, even better, an explanation from someone knowledgeable in \"ice cream science\" to tell me why this recipe works *despite* a number of the metrics being off in the calc. Is it just the nature of fruit-heavy flavors - with their high water content - that necessitates an ice cream lower in solids and higher sugar? Does the corn syrup really have such a large effect on the \"creaminess\" of the ice cream? I've been using it in my recipes at a much lower rate (about 0.33 to 0.5 cups corn syrup to 1.5 to 2 cups sucrose) to improve scoopability, so I have some familiarity with the product.

I experimented at my own store this week by brewing the vanilla base we get (10qts) with 1 lb of beans and tried two batches one with unground one with ground beans.

Refigerate beans-in overnight and used next day.\n\nI was so excited that the FLAVOR was incredible. HOWEVER i was straining the grinds batch for over an hour! I lost about 25% of the base to straining and could not seem to get the grinds out. Looking into it I need to get either a brew bag or use a cheesecloth so i come here for advice on which method to use. Should i crush the beans instead of grinding them? Would it still need brew bag/cheesecloth?\n\nBTW the unground batch was very deep and smooth, less acidic.

The problem is that I started a job a while ago with a completely different machine and my ice creams have been coming out either too soft or too hard. I just realized that it is likely due to my current job's machine actually being a *gelato* spinner. It is a top loading and top manual-extracting; it seems to be much less powerful than what I'm used to as it spins/freezes and of course does not compress any air into the ice cream.\n\nMy ice cream base is egg-free and I use a combination of dextrose powder, milk powder, and sometimes invert sugar to soften the ice cream, as well as the recommended amount of stabilizer (UNO to be specific). Sometimes the ice cream gets softer over time; why would that happen? Why am I having trouble maintaining a scoopable ice cream texture now that I am using a gelato machine? It is just always either too hard, as if there isn't enough air folded into it, or too soft, as if I have used too much soft sugars. \n\nPlease let me know your theories on what is going on and what I can adjust in my recipes to find more success with my gelato spinner when I am technically trying to make ice cream. \n\nThank you so much in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1k6ydra/ice_cream_spun_in_gelato_machine_professional/", "created_utc": 1745516471.0, "score": 3, "author": "charlollie", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1k6ydra/ice_cream_spun_in_gelato_machine_professional/", "html_title": ""}

I want you to use these ingredients and make me a recipe. I also want you to create a python script that then verifies the ratios. The ratios I'm looking at are\n    \n    Milk fat (5 to 9%)\n    Total fat (5-12%)\n    Milk solids (16-22%)\n    Total solids (35-40%)\n    Water (60-65%)\n    Serving temp (-14c to -11c at 74%)\n    Pod of 165 to 185\n    Stabilizers/Water of 0.2-0.35%\n    Emulsifiers of 0.3 to 0.5%\n    Lactose concentration <10%\n\nThe resulting recipe was\n\nIngredient\t\n\nWhole Milk (3.5%)\t597 \n\nHeavy Cream (36%)\t145 \n\nSkim Milk Powder\t43 \n\nSucrose\t50 \n\nDextrose\t155 \n\nLecithin (Soy)\t4 \n\nGuar Gum\t0.75\n\nCMC\t0.75 \n\nVanilla Pod\t1 \n\nVanilla Extract\t5 \n\nTotal\t1000\n\nWhile the IceCreamCalc was \n\nIngredient\t\n\nWhole Milk (3.5%)\t587 \n\nHeavy Cream (36%)\t177 \n\nSkim Milk Powder\t45 \n\nSucrose\t134 \n\nDextrose\t44 \n\nLecithin (Soy)\t4 \n\nStabilizer\t1.71 \n\nVanilla Pod\t1 \n\nVanilla Extract\t5 \n\nTotal\t1000\n\n  \nAs you can see, not TOO far off, heavier on the cream, more dextrose than sucrose which results in a serving temp of \\~16\u00baC @ 69%, which from the explanation, it wasn't able to calculate. Every other ratio is well within the intervals I specified. \n\nWhile it doesn't replace a calculator (especially one like IceCreamCalc), it can certainly give you a very decent base recipe to build upon :)\n\nFor reference, I used what I consider to be the best LLM right now, Gemini 2.5 Pro (you can access it for free via Google's AI Studio)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1k2chlk/using_aillms_to_createdebug_ice_cream_recipes/", "created_utc": 1745002168.0, "score": 0, "author": "mazatz", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1k2chlk/using_aillms_to_createdebug_ice_cream_recipes/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Panforte ice cream", "selftext": "This is  a recipe by David Lebovitz that I have made several times because it is like nothing else I have ever tasted in an ice cream. It has a rich creamy mouth feel, a deep lingering taste from the herbs and honey and a satisfying crunch from the roasted almonds.\n\nAs David says,  using a strong honey makes all the difference. Stay away from the super market honeys as they are too weak in flavor.\n\nThis batch I used raw unfiltered leatherwood honey from Tasmania. I have also used raw honey from a friends hive which was also delicious.\n\nHas anyone made this. Would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThis is the recipe as provided by David Lebovitz....\n\n**Panforte ice cream Makes about 1 quart (1l)**\n\nRecipe adapted from The Perfect Scoop I use a honey that\u2019s on the stronger side, which provides the best flavor. If you have buckwheat honey, that\u2019s my favorite, but any honey that\u2019s on the darker side will work, although you can also use mild honey, too.\n\n1 cup (250ml) half-and-half or whole milk\n\n2/3 cup (130g) sugar\n\n1 cinnamon stick, broken in half\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\n\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\nBig pinch of salt 2 cups (500ml) heavy cream\n\n4 large egg yolks\n\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\n3 tablespoons (45ml) strongly flavored honey\n\n1/2 cup (80-100g) chopped candied citrus peel\n\n1/2 cup (65g) toasted almonds, coarsely chopped\n\nIn a medium saucepan, warm the half-and-half or milk with the sugar, spices, and salt. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 1 hour to steep. When ready to make the ice cream, pour the cream into a medium-large bowl. Set the bowl of cream into a larger bowl that\u2019s partially filled with ice and a little water, and set a mesh strainer over the top of the bowl of cream.\n\nRewarm the spice-infused mixture. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg yolks, whisking constantly as you pour, then scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan. Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof flexible spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula. Pour the custard through the strainer into the cream. Discard or compost the cinnamon stick. Add the vanilla to the custard. Stir the custard until cool. While the custard is cooling, warm the honey in a small saucepan, then stir it into the custard. Chill the mixture thoroughly, then freeze in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. When the ice cream is finished churning, stir in the chopped candied citrus peel and almonds.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4oqlggv0sive1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d31c9c35fd51afa73b4931a1e0ab65f68b3c19a\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1k1w9nn/panforte_ice_cream/", "created_utc": 1744949899.0, "score": 11, "author": "kraj3187", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1k1w9nn/panforte_ice_cream/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Olive oil, vanilla and bay leaf ice cream - a delicious and mostly successful experiment", "selftext": "This is a follow-up to my previous post asking for advice and input on making olive oil ice cream, so thank you to those who made helpful comments.\n\nI'll write some notes about what I did, and then I'll write a recipe which reflects what I would do next time. Skip to the recipe if you have no interest in the experimentation process.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe first step was I took my 100g of extra virgin olive oil (decent quality stuff, nice grassy/herbal flavour, but not fruity/floral like I should do in future) and I put five dried bay leaves in it and heated for about 15 minutes at between 60 and 80\u00b0C to infuse the flavour. I tasted the oil afterwards and frankly I don't think this worked! Possibly the bay leaves I've grown are just not that strong, or the olive oil flavour is too strong.\n\nThe base was heated with three more bay leaves and one vanilla pod with all seeds scraped into the mix. I tasted this after it had been brought up to 84\u00b0C and was cooling down again, and it tasted delicious. Predominantly vanilla, but the bay leaf was also there backing it up. Nice combination.\n\nThe next tasting point was after the olive oil had been added and churning was just completed. (This took longer than the usual 30 minutes to get to soft serve stage which seemed like a bad sign). I think tasting at this point is the moment you know whether you've got something magic, and in this case, yes I did. I was genuinely surprised, I think I said \"Oh!\" out loud. Also, could I taste the bay leaves anymore? Not sure!\n\nThe final tasting point was after it had been in a container for several hours to freeze statically, and I have to say when I tasted it straight out of the freezer it was great, but it didn't quite have the same wow factor any more... Perhaps the fact it wasn't my first impression didn't help, but anyway this led me to decide that I should aim for a higher scooping temperature so that it would be warmer upon consumption, and therefore hopefully the flavour would be more 'available' so to speak, to the taste buds. This of course means that it won't be so scoopable straight out of the freezer and might need ten minutes in the fridge before serving. The side benefit is that less sugar might mask the flavours less? And perhaps I should try to decrease the sugars even more...\n\n\nRECIPE\n\nI'm definitely onto something with this one!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n500g whole milk (~3.5% fat)\n100g heavy cream (36% fat)\n50g skim milk powder\n130g sucrose\n100g olive oil\n54g egg yolk (= 3 large egg yolks for me)\n1/8tsp xanthan gum, level\n1/8tsp guar gum, rounded (Use your preferred stabiliser/s. I like these because they have synergy)\n1/4tsp salt (~1.4g)\n7 to 10 bay leaves (I have access to a tree with plenty of leaves. If bay leaves are expensive for you, you could just omit these. Bay is not the main flavour)\n1 vanilla bean. Scrape the seeds and cut into pieces with scissors when adding to base.\n\nMETHOD\n1. Add all dry ingredients to a bowl and mix well to disperse stabilisers.\n2. Add milk cream, eggs, bay leaves and vanilla to a pot and whisk thoroughly.\n3. Slowly and gently heat the mixture, whisking continuously and tracking it with a thermometer.\n4. When it's above 40\u00b0C whisk in the dry ingredients.\n5. Continue slowly heating and whisking until it reaches 84\u00b0C.\n6. Remove pot and place in ice water. (I do this in my sink)\n7. Once the mix has cooled right down, place it in the fridge overnight to age.\n8. Pour 100g of olive oil into some kind of jug or pouring vessel. Remove your mix from the fridge and prepare your ice cream maker.\n9. Churn. After ten minutes of churning, pause the machine and use an immersion blender to aggressively blend the olive oil into the mix as you steadily stream it in.\n10. Continue churning until soft serve stage and then decant into container and place in freezer. To serve, remove from freezer and place in fridge for approximately ten minutes to reach scooping temperature. (Probably! Who really knows?)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES\n1. You can use a vanilla bean or vanilla extract, but don't use *vanilla essence* which is basically just vanillin. Real vanilla has hundreds of other volatile aroma molecules, and some of these aroma molecules make a link with the aroma molecules in olive oil, which is why they make a great combination. Also real vanilla just tastes better when it's a main flavour in something like this. I wish it were cheaper.\n\n2. My original sugar quantities were sucrose 110g and dextrose 40g, which gave a serving temp. of -16\u00b0C. For this reformulated recipe the serving temp. according to ice cream calculator is -13\u00b0C. The POD is 149, so not super sweet.\n\n3. I'm actually considering doing this with 80g sucrose and 30g dextrose, which gives the same serving temp. of -13\u00b0C but a POD of 120.8, so much, much less sweet, more adult, and perhaps with the herbal flavours able to better shine through?

Below is the recipe I used and taking the Ice cream out of the freezer a bit early to warm in fridge had it lasting several days.\n\nThat said the Ninja Creami has changed my life and I sold my compressor model. 400ml divided containers, if they get a bit too hard you just respin and freeze again so you NEVER have blocks of ice or feel the need to eat the whole sucker fast. FANTASTIC textures. Larger batches I just transfer to 1L insulated ice cream containers after spinning and refreeze. I would never go back.\n\nThis is for using the entire 1L (938g) container of 35% cream I get from Costco. Scale as you like.\n\n35% cream - 938g (1L/quart container)\n\nWhole milk (have done with 2% as well) - 300g\n\nSugar - 191g\n\nEgg yolks - 7.6 (I round up to 8)\n\nVanilla extract - 22.5g (22.5 ml)\n\nIf doing chocolate (7.5 tablespoons dutch processed powdered baking cocoa - sorry keep forgetting to weigh)\n\nIf doing mint - 15 ml peppermint extract + 24 drops green foodcoloring (can add 75g chopped dark chocolate or chopped bitter-sweet bakers chocolate while spinning)\n\nThis makes a bit over 3 containers (500ml containers but you only fill 400ml/g) for the Creami or about 1.5L in a traditional manner.\n\nAdd cream, milk, sugar and heat while stirring to 160F (71C) and mixture starts to coat back of a spoon and remove from heat.\n\nWhisk the egg yolks in another bowl and add 1-2 cups of the hot mixture to the yolks while mixing then pour back into the hot mixture while whisking.\n\nIf you are doing vanilla add at the cooling phase. If you are doing mint I would add vanilla and mint during the heating phase as I found I needed to blow off the alcohol or it was too soft. If doing chocolate I would add vanilla after cooling as the alcohol helps keep it soft.\n\n(With the Creami it is easy to split the base and do 3 different batches. Eg. 1/3 as pure vanilla - (pour 400ml mixture into container and add 7.5ml vanilla extract), 1/3 as mint chocolate (pour 400ml/g into small pot and heat a bit as adding 7.5ml vanilla extract + 5ml peppermint extract + 8 drops green food colouring then after frozen spin once then incorporate spin 25g chopped dark chocolate), 1/3 chocolate (pour 400ml/g into a small pot, add 2.5 tablespoons dutch processed powered cacao, transfer to Creami container and add 7.5ml vanilla extract before freezing).\n\nHope this helps.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1jvhiua/best_ice_cream_custard_base_i_found_that_works/", "created_utc": 1744234617.0, "score": 5, "author": "frozennorthfruit", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1jvhiua/best_ice_cream_custard_base_i_found_that_works/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Most of the polyols have 0 sugar in them, so the calculator (especially the balancer) will try to come up with weird methods to bump the sugar.\n\nHow should we be dealing with polyols? Should we completely drop sugars for POD when dealing with these low-sugar/no-sugar recipes? If so, what values should we be looking to target?\n\nTrying to answer myself - a recipe with equal POD + solids should taste and feel similar enough. There are a lot of variables that a calculator can't account for, given that polyols are not as fungible as sucrose, and also some have some side effects, e.g. erythritol has a cooling effect. If working from an existing recipe you like, these should be good.

{"title": "Commercialised lactose-free ice cream?", "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI\u2019ve been wondering why most ice cream or gelato shops don\u2019t offer lactose-free options (and I\u2019m not talking about vegan ice creams here).\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve learned, lactose-free dairy products are made by using the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. My understanding is that while lactose can contribute to viscosity, it also poses a risk of crystallization, which is generally undesirable in ice cream. (Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u2014I\u2019m still learning!)\n\nSince glucose doesn\u2019t seem to have any major downsides in ice cream and adds sweetness (thanks to its higher POD compared to lactose), I thought using lactose-free dairy might actually offer some advantages. It\u2019s sweeter and might even improve texture in some cases. So why don\u2019t more shops use it?\n\nIs it mostly a cost issue?

{"title": "\ud83c\udf4b FINALLY, MY LEMON BAR ICE CREAM RECIPE! \ud83c\udf4b", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI wanted to finally share my Lemon Bar Ice Cream recipe as a token of my appreciation! I am so darn sorry for the time it is taking my cookbook to hit store shelves, and I know many of you are anxious to try my recipes. This flavor was my top seller when I was wholesaling pints in Seattle. It is an intensely Lemon ice cream with pieces of homemade Lemon Bars - with a buttery shortbread crust which is one of my favorite parts! After reviewing the recipe, please let me know if you have any questions. Also, if you make it, please let us know your thoughts! \n\nLastly, follows on SM matter the most to publishers. My handles are in my profile. Obviously, no pressure and thank you for considering. Thank you, too, for all of your support and encouragement you have shared along the way! May you cherish and love this recipe just as I and so many folks in Seattle have! \n\nMost warmly,\nLauren \nSweet Lo\u2019s Ice Cream \n\n\nMy Famous Lemon Bar \n\nThis is one of my most sought after recipes! Behind Cookies N Cream, Lemon Bar was the second most popular flavor sold in grocery stores in Seattle. Luscious lemon ice cream chock full of homemade lemon bars. My favorite part is the buttery crust of the lemon bar mixed with the tangy, sweet ice cream. Even if you\u2019re not necessarily a fan of lemon, this combination has the power to change your mind and buds! \n\nYield: about 2 quarts \n\nIntensely Lemon Ice Cream Base \n\nZest of 3 large lemons separated\n1 cup (200g) white sugar\n1 \u00bd cups (368g) whole milk\n1 \u00bd cups (357g) heavy cream\n\u00bc cup (33g) nonfat dry milk powder\n\u00bc tsp (1.3g) salt\n\u00be cup (172.5g) lemon juice, from the 3 lemons you zested \n3 (54g) egg yolks\n\n2 cups lemon bars, chopped (recipe below) \n\nBefore starting, set aside a medium sized bowl (one with a lid) with a fine mesh strainer on top. \n\n1. Zest all three lemons. Add the sugar and \u00be of the lemon zest to a small bowl and massage the zest into the sugar until combined.\n2. In a medium-sized heavy bottom saucepan, add the whole milk, heavy cream, nonfat dry milk powder, sugar and salt. Heat over low to medium heat, gently bringing the mixture up to a low simmer. Simmer for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously until all ingredients are dissolved. Remove from heat, cover the saucepan, and allow to steep for 20 minutes.\n3. While the dairy mixture is steeping, juice the three lemons. Strain the pulp and seeds. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the pulp and add it back into the juice. Put the juice in a jar with a lid, and set aside in the refrigerator. It will be added to the base, once the base has cooled completely.\n4. After 20 minutes, uncover the saucepan and bring mixture back to a simmer over low heat. While the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\n5. Once the dairy mixture is warm, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn heat to medium. As the yolks warm, you\u2019ll notice the mixture start to thicken.\nContinue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon and registers about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer, about 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer. \n6. Allow the base to cool at room temperature for an hour. Add a lid and refrigerate for 5 hours. Once the base is completely chilled, stir in the lemon juice with pulp and remaining lemon zest. Re-lid and keep in the refrigerator and allow the base to age overnight. Make the lemon bars. \n7. When you are ready to churn, give the base a stir with a whisk and pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream maker. Freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. \n8. To assemble your Lemon Bar Ice Cream: Remove churned ice cream from the machine into a medium sized bowl. Gently stir in the lemon bar chunks, adding more as you see fit. \n9. Scoop churned ice cream into an airtight container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on (the lid won\u2019t fit if the container is too full). Freeze until the ice cream is firm and flavor is ripened, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nLemon Bars \nYield: 9 x 13 pan \n\nFor the crust: \n6 oz (170g) salted butter, melted\n\u2153 cup + 2 tbsp (90g) white sugar\n\u00bd tsp (2.6g) salt\n1 tsp (4.4g) vanilla extract \n1 \u00bd cup (192g) flour \n\nFor the Lemon Filling:\n6 (300g) eggs \n2 1/4 cup (450g) white sugar \n1 \u00bc cup 287g) fresh lemon juice \n\u00be tsp lemon extract \n\u00be cup + 1 tbsp (102g) flour, sifted\n\n\u00be cup powdered sugar, sifted, for topping once cooled (optional) \n\n1. Set the oven to 350F degrees. Lightly grease your baking pan with shortening and line with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium sized pot, gently melt the butter over low heat. Once the butter is melted, remove from the heat and stir in sugar, salt and vanilla extract. Continue to stir the mixture for 1 minute to bring down the temperature slightly.\n3. Add the flour to the sugar/butter mixture and mix well, until it forms a soft dough.\nTransfer the dough to the prepared pan and gently work the dough into a thin, even layer.* The dough will appear greasy - this is perfect. The secret to working with the dough is to be gentle and to work between using your fingers and your palms to push it into place. You will find that it can be manipulated easily. \n4. Bake the crust for 20 -25 minutes. When the crust is done, it will be a golden brown color. \n5. While the crust is baking, make the filling. Whisk together the eggs and sugar. \nGently mix in the lemon juice and lemon extract.\n6. Sift the flour into the mixture and whisk vigorously until fully combined.\n7. Lastly, strain the lemon mixture through a sieve to thin out any lumps. You can press any remaining flour bits through the strainer, into the mixture. \n8. Once the crust has finished baking, pour the lemon mixture over the hot crust and return to the oven. Bake for an additional 20-25 minutes. This time varies, so begin with 20 minutes and add time as needed. Bake until the center is set and does not wiggle when moved. \n9. Let cool to room temperature. Cover with foil and refrigerate until ready to chop and add small squares to churned ice cream. If you are topping with sifted powdered sugar, do so now. Enjoy the remaining lemon bars with a cup of tea or alongside a scoop of lemon bar or vanilla ice cream\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrlh4v", "created_utc": 1743797604.0, "score": 471, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1jrlh4v/finally_my_lemon_bar_ice_cream_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

I've churned it for 20 minutes and it seemed fine, but I wanted to churn it more, because that's my first time making a sorbet and I dont have an experience. After a total of 30 minutes I've noticed some strange sort of lumps which were yellower than the rest of the mass, so I stopped churning. After me trying it I found that those lumps are hard and have a hair-like structure, it seemed like stabilizers kind of coagulated and formed them. Now I wonder what did I wrong, if proportion of stabilizers is right. Is it too much churning? I've never heard before that exceccive churning can make stabilizers to clump together. I also used a hand blender to make the base, and I've blended it when stabilizers were in, too. Maybe it's too much of a mechanical action? Or I just have had a bad mango with too much fiber?

{"title": "Texture Tips for Fruit-Based Ice Cream", "selftext": "hi there! This is my first post on here, i've been experimenting making ice cream for the last few months.  One of the issues i've run into is when making fruit based flavors (think black raspberry, blueberry, banana chip, etc.), my texture tends to come out more icy than i would like as opposed to creamy.  I managed to make a pretty solid strawberry but have otherwise been struggling with this.  Does anyone have any tips to fix this?\n\nFor more context, I use Jeni Britton's method from her masterclass which uses no eggs (i've tried many different base recipes and have found this one has yielded the best results for me). I also ideally like to use as many fresh/real ingredients as possible as opposed to artificial flavoring.  I fear this might be the root cause of the issue since i'm relying a lot on the fruit and berries for the flavor which tend to have high water content.  \n\nWould love any tips or thoughts you guys might have!

{"title": "Why did my peanut butter ice cream turn out grainy", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI made 2 batches of peanut butter ice cream, one turned out grainy but the other one turned out great.  The only difference between the recipes as far as I can tell is I added 1/4 tsp of salt to the first batch (which turned out grainy).  Can that amount of salt affect the emulsification or freezing point drastically? Or could it be some other reason (an inconsistency in how I mixed my base or something?).  I did notice that my first batch (with salt) did not have frozen base on the sides of the bowl, which was unusual but I would be surprised if that small amount of salt could change the freezing point that drastically.  Here are the recipes/images:\n\nBatch 1 (the grainy one):\n\n1 1/2 cup of milk\n\n1 1/2 cup of heavy cream\n\n1/2 cup + 1 tbsp of granulated sugar (112.5 grams)\n\n1/2 cup of peanut butter ( I used creamy Jiff)\n\n1/4 tsp xanthan gum\n\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n\n1/4 tsp salt\n\nI put the milk and peanut butter into my hand food processor, grinded it up until it was a consistent liquid. Then I put it into a pot at low heat, and dissolved the sugar, xanthan gum, salt into the mixture.  After dissolving all of that for roughly 3 mins, I mixed in the cream and vanilla extract, then put it into an ice bath until it was 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  Then I put it in my ice cream maker (lello musso 4080 so no need to freeze the bowl) for around 12 minutes.\n\n[Batch 1 \\(the grainy one\\)](https://preview.redd.it/clb7v3wdlape1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d851bdd7b83bc37cf98e816cd523bcc5ae89d894)\n\nBatch 2: I followed the same recipe as batch 1, except I did not add salt.\n\n[Batch 2, the good one](https://preview.redd.it/dnfq8u1nlape1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=752b79ab5656d701ae02a9d5a5598589711efba6)\n\nI am not sure if it was merely the salt that caused the base to not emulsify properly? Or if something else could be wrong?  Has anyone run into this before?\n\nEdit: I tried it again with salt but kept it over heat for longer and slightly higher and it worked!

My wife, rightfully so, is frustrated that I wasted all that time and still don't have a healthy, high-protein ice cream recipe for us. So now, I'm trying to prove that high-protein ice cream isn't going to taste as good as a well-balanced ice cream made with SKM powder, heavy cream, evaporated milk, and stabilizers. So we are going to do a taste test to see if all the extra ingredients/time is worth it. \n\nWhat I'm looking for: Your favorite well balanced vanilla base for Oreo ice cream for my ninja creami.

Mix the sugar (or allulose) with the skim milk powder (if using), carboxymethyl cellulose, guar gum and lambda carrageenan. If you don't have the stabilizers, which are the last three ingredients, for easy-to-find stabilizers, substitute 1 g of xanthan gum, and then dissolve 3 g of gelatin in about \u2153 of the milk you heat to 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). If you don't have any stabilizers at all, you can still make this recipe, but you might need to eat it immediately when you're done, because it might not keep well in the freezer overnight.\n2. If you are not using pecan butter, you will need to grind the pecans into a paste, which is pecan butter. The best way is with a melanger or wet grinder, but it is possible with a blender or food processor, scraping down the sides every so often.\n3. Put one egg yolk (and half the water, if using) into a cylindrical container, slightly wider than the diameter of your immersion blender. Start your immersion blender, and add the pecan butter, a little at a time. If your blender struggles to incorporate, add a little of the cold milk, until it no longer struggles. Continue to add the pecan butter until you have used half the pecan butter, and set it aside. Repeat the entire process with the other egg yolk (and the rest of the water, if using) with the other half of the pecan butter.\n3. Put a little of the pecan mixture, (a little of the melted butter, if using,) a little of the milk and a little of the sugar mixture into the blender and blend until well combined. Only do a little, or else you might clog your blender. Once blended, pour into a bowl, and then put a little of the pecan mixture, (melted butter, if using,) milk and sugar mixture into the blender again, blending and pouring into the bowl once more. Repeat until all your ingredients are blended together.\n4. If you have an ice cream maker, empty the bowl into your ice cream maker, and follow the manufacturer's instructions for making ice cream. If your ice cream maker doesn't have its own compressor, you will need to let you batter cool to at least room temperature first. If you don't have an ice cream maker, empty the bowl into a loaf pan, and then place it in the freezer, scraping down the sides and bottom with a spatula and then beating with an electric mixer every 10 to 15 minutes, until your desired consistency.\n\n#Variations:\n1. If you're allergic to eggs, remove the eggs. Instead, use 2 g of soy lecithin (or 0.8 g polysorbate 80), 7 g pecan and 25 g water, which is enough to replace the two eggs.\n2. For butter pecan gelato, let the pecan butter sit in a container at room temperature, until the oil rises to the top. While still in the container, weigh the pecan butter (in the container). Gently remove pecan oil. Now weigh again and subtract. This is how much oil you removed. Replace this with the same amount of clarified butter, also called ghee.\n\n#Taste & Texture:\n1. The texture is incredible, easily scoopable even immediately out of the freezer, even with just a room temperature spoon. The ingredients really do a fantastic job here, emulsifying the fat from the pecans and stabilizing the air in the ice cream.\n2. The pecan superpremium ice cream is very much a pecan lover's ice cream. The gelato is more mild and lower in fat. Butter pecan superpremium ice cream is a balance between the mild flavor of the gelato with the rich taste of the superpremium ice cream.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j33wfj", "created_utc": 1741066829.0, "score": 37, "author": "Taric250", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1j33wfj/pecan_gelato_or_superpremium_ice_cream_with_or/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How To Make Ice Cream More Solid", "selftext": "The base recipe I found searching online was exceptionally simple (1+1/2 cup heavy cream, 1+1/2 cup whole milk, half cup of sugar, tablespoon of vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon of salt). For vanilla and chocolate chip, those two batches came out at a perfect consistency.\n\nFor some of my experiments though (Suntory Toki + Peanutbutter Cups, or gatorade powder + M&M's), I found that it stayed VERY soft no matter how long it was in the freezer. Like, I can scoop it, it's not soup, and it holds its form for a surprisingly long time before actualy melting, but it's really not an ice cream texture. (once it hits the bowl it immediately flattens from scoop shape to kind of what you'd expect non-canned whipped cream to do)\n\nI know alcohol can prevent freezing, so I'm assuming that was my issue on the Toki batch, but I'm less sure what went wrong on the gatorade batch.\n\nOnce thing I realized this week that I suspect might be part of my problem, is that I wasn't putting in enough cream/milk, so my ratios might be off and fixing that might solve problem. (I was using a liquid measuring cup I picked up in Japan when traveling, and didn't realize \"1 cup\" in Japan and \"1 cup\" in America weren't the same thing, so the measuring cup I was using says 1 cup is only 200mL rather than 240mL)\n\nAre there any other things other than more cream/milk that might make it a little more solid if addressing that doesn't get it where it needs to be? Not looking for a brick, but would like something that could keep it's shape (and maybe at some point be used to make an ice cream cake)\n\nIf relevant, my maker is a Whynter ICM-201SB, and I just turn it on and hit go with the default settings (60 minutes)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1iwfo7s/how_to_make_ice_cream_more_solid/", "created_utc": 1740332466.0, "score": 5, "author": "reaper527", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1iwfo7s/how_to_make_ice_cream_more_solid/", "html_title": ""}

You gave me helpful advice but nothing first-hand. The company's online presence here (including reviews) is ... sparse.\n\nWith some effort, I got in touch with the US distributor, which is now [Espresso Milan](https://espressomilan.com) in  New York State. Nemox USA is run from there. They're also the importer of La Pavoni espresso machines. After I'd written an email and tried calling (didn't actually leave voicemail) I got a call from Dominic, who runs the place. He was extremely generous with his time and answered all my questions. Here's what I learned, in no particular order:\n\n* Their offices and showroom are in Montebello, NY, just north of NYC.\n* Their warehouse and technical people are in New Jersey.\n* Warranty is 1 year. Parts are available stateside.\n* Warranty service is performed in New Jersey, so if the machine needs major repairs you have to get it to them. But they say to always call; in many cases a problem can be solved by replacing a simple part without shipping the machine.\n* Out-of-warranty service can be performed by any refrigeration technician. But again, call Nemox first for parts and advice.\n* If you're shopping for a Nemox machine, call Espresso Milan. They may have a deal on an open-box unit or older model.\n\nI was encouraged by this conversation. I'd been weighing a Lello Musso 5030 (some discouraging service stories reported online) and a Nemox (nothing reported anywhere!). This made my choice easier. After traveling next week, I'm planning to take delivery of a Nemox Gelato Chef 5L.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vazjr4tshwke1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6764bf89d01834e7ff019b0f97fab65e97d67a2\n\nStay tuned!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1iwbgyn/nemox_batch_freezers_in_the_us_revisited/", "created_utc": 1740321338.0, "score": 14, "author": "UnderbellyNYC", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1iwbgyn/nemox_batch_freezers_in_the_us_revisited/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Quick freezing while hand stirring", "selftext": "This will be long winded, but I couldn\u2019t find anything about it anywhere in my searches maybe I\u2019m using the wrong keywords, but here goes : \n\nISSUE: I had a freezer bowl ice cream maker 20+ years ago. I probably used it five or six times before I gave up due to my dissatisfaction with the texture due to ice crystals. To justify a gadget that space intensive that can\u2019t closely match a commercial product wasn\u2019t worth it to me. \n\nHISTORY: I\u2019ve been quick freezing my fish at home for years (like 20) using a technique from an obscure book from 1980 basically emulating the chilled brine system that most small to medium fishing vessels have these days at least around here. This involves using a 23% salt solution chilled in the freezer just about to freezing. I usually wait till it\u2019s got a frozen surface and then I just break that up with solid frozen bottles of the same solution usually like 20 ounce Gatorade cause they\u2019re thick and they hold up to the stresses.  \nThen I take my freshly caught and vacuum sealed fish pieces and submerge them in the chilled brine with the frozen solid brine bottles weighting them down. This results in 1 inch or thinner pieces freezing rock solid in less than 30 minutes the surface freezes instantaneously. \n\nQUESTION: so the obvious question if you read all that is could I just take my metal bowl from my stand mixer and press it down in the chilled brine with solid brine bottle heat sinks, floating in that brine to emulate the classic rock salt and ice while whisking vigorously by hand and achieve a significantly or near-commercial level ice cream texture of do I need more air infusion through slower more measured freeze? \n\nYeah, this is probably over thought but that\u2019s what I do and I thought the details of my specific method would help and also if you like fish, this method will keep your fish crazy long like years if your freezer is subzero", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1ivnzwx/quick_freezing_while_hand_stirring/", "created_utc": 1740245291.0, "score": 2, "author": "fleedermouse", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1ivnzwx/quick_freezing_while_hand_stirring/", "html_title": ""}

In a medium-sized heavy bottom saucepan, add the whole milk, heavy cream, nonfat dry milk powder, sugar, salt and instant coffee. Heat over low to medium heat, gently bringing the mixture up to a low simmer. Simmer for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously until all ingredients are incorporated.\n2.

Once the milk mixture is combined and all the ingredients are incorporated, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn the heat to medium. \n4. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, registering about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer. This will take about 5 to 7 minutes. \n5. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer into the bowl you set aside.

It's also another process that you now have to perform. What I've been doing for about a year is freeze dry fruit which preserves something like 97-99% of the flavor compounds. Then you can powderized the fruit to make it easy to mix in. Now freezedriers are a bit expensive but fortunately thats not what I do because you can just buy freeze dried powderized fruit online with one ingredient: the fruit.

What are the drawbacks and advantages of going with the compressor machine over splurging on the Ninja Creami?\n\nHere are a few specific questions I have:\n\n1. **Texture and Consistency:** Does one produce a better texture than the other?\n2. **Versatility:** Can a compressor machine handle the same variety of recipes (gelato, sorbet, frozen yogurt, etc.) as the Ninja Creami?\n3. **Ease of Use:** How do the two compare in terms of user-friendliness and cleanup?\n4. **Longevity and Durability:** Is the Ninja Creami built to last longer than a typical compressor machine?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your experiences and any advice you might have.

{"title": "Why? And how?", "selftext": "I see some are asking why their ice cream turn grainy or crumbly and so on.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief explanation. \n\nChunky ice cream:\nIf the ice cream visually looks coarse or feels chunky it\u2019s because you have cooked the eggs in your base to scrambled eggs. Temperature of your base was too high. Next time do not go over 85\u00b0c and make sure you add the eggs at 45\u00b0c while constantly whisking or mixing your base homogenizing the mixture as much as possible.\n\nFluffy ice cream:\nEven tho this texture sounds appealing. It\u2019s really not. The reason behind ice cream being fluffy can be because of low amount of solids, or high over run (too much air added to ice cream). This can also make ice cream melt faster.\nOther reason could be because of insufficient stabilizer.\n\nIcy ice cream ( you can say that five times).\nThis happens because it was either melted and re froze in freezer to to a breakdown or sudden temperature fluctuations.\nLow protein, or Low solids like milk fat, sugar, stabilizer and such. \nImmature aging ( not enough time to allow the ice cream to age).\nInsufficient homogenizing.\nSlow freezing.  \nAnd inaccurate freezer temperature. Best to store ice cream at room temperature-18\u00b0c for long term storage and at -11\u00b0c for short term storage. \n\nMelts too fast\nMalfunctions in freezer \nRoom is too warm\nNot enough solids \nNot enough stabilizer \n\nCrumbles \nToo much air \nNot enough eggs or stabilizer \nNot enough solids \n\nI hope this helps to improve your next batch.

I had checked the page \\*at least\\* every day since the first of June.\u00a0 The 7-day course was already full so I immediately signed up for the Ice Cream 101 course.\u00a0\n\nThe Monday of the week of the event, I received an email with the agenda attached.\n\nOn Thursday I flew in from KC to Pittsburgh, got a rental car and did the 2.5 hr drive to State College, PA without incident, arriving about 3:30pm local time.\u00a0 I stayed at the Hyatt off of Beaver Ave, but pretty much any hotel in the area is going to be within 10 minutes of the venue. There are also flight options to State College, PA itself (really!), Philadelphia, or Baltimore.\u00a0 Get your hotel early, college events scheduled that weekend may cause rooms to fill up closer to the date and prices may skyrocket.\n\nEvent Experience:\n\nRegistration was Friday, 11am at the Penn Stater.\u00a0 It\u2019s handled like any small conference event in a hotel, signed in at the registration table, got my swag and box lunch (sandwich, cookie, chips, fruit, drink) and headed to the assigned conference room.\u00a0 All class materials and slides, probably around 150 pages, are given out in a large 3-ring binder.\n\nThe room held 100 people, there were a little over 75 attendees on the contact info sheet with 7-8 staff members/presenters and 7-8 speakers and vendors in attendance.\u00a0 Of those 75 people, 17 states were represented and several countries including Japan, China, Mexica, Singapore.\u00a0 Most of the US attendees\u00a0 were within 300 miles of PA.\u00a0 Everyone gave a brief 45-60 second introduction, while there were some people that were new to ice cream making and there to learn, most either owned or had stated plans to own a restaurant, coffee shop, or ice cream shop and were looking to gain skills.\u00a0 Several had been in business for quite a few years and were looking to hone their skills in the interest of continuing education.\u00a0 There were a few dairy farm owners that were seeking to make the jump to ice cream manufacture.\n\nThe first day\u2019s reception event was reasonably well attended, I met a few contacts and am glad I stayed. \u00a0 Also, there were three ice creams available to sample - Peachy Paterno, Raspberry Torte, Death by Chocolate.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have any official Berkey Creamery after that, but had about 10-14 other flavor samples during labs, not counting the 10-12 vanilla and chocolate samples in the tasting lab.\n\nCourse Content:\n\n(not including lunch/breaks)\n\nFirst day was 5 hrs of lecture.\u00a0\n\nSecond day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.\n\nThird day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.\u00a0\n\nFor labs, the class was split up into three groups of approximately\u00a0 25 people each.\n\nSession topics included: Ice Cream Overview, Composition, Ice Cream Operation, Ingredients, Fresh Fruit, Mix Processing, Make Your Own Mix?, Flavors and Inclusions, Self Serve and Fresh Serve, Gelato, Entrepreneurial Topic, Freezing and Hardening, Post Freezing and Customer Engagement, Non-Dairy Desserts, Equipment Choices, Choosing Mix Suppliers, and Food Regulations.\n\nLab Exercises/Demonstration topics included: Soft Serve/Direct Draw machine maintenance and use, alcohol freezing, handheld treats, and Batch Freezers types and use with ice creams, gelatos and custards, ice cream formulations (taste testing 10-11 different samples and judging respective quality, defects, etc.)\n\nI am sure the above is subject to change based on need and speaker availability.\u00a0 Class flow was excellent and modules built on each other with little to no overlap on topics.\u00a0 Dr. Roberts ran a tight ship, this entire event was on time to the minute.\u00a0 Class attendees asked great questions, no one got off topic or meandered into any side discussions.\u00a0\n\nPersonal Notes:\n\nI'm glad I did the 101 course, it was stated during the sessions that the primary difference between the 101 and the 7-day short course was days of additional content (and presumably labs) on each individual ingredient and mix formulation.\u00a0 While the labs would have been fun, the lecture would have not been useful to me as someone not employed by a large-scale manufacturer.\n\nI was not at the point where I had a defined concept and business plan, so I was not quite ready to establish formal relationships with vendors and suppliers.\u00a0 But I took down everyone\u2019s information, am sending thank you emails now and will follow up when my plans have \u2018hardened,\u2019 pun intended.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this course did accomplish all of my personal goals: I will be digging deeper into the regulations around starting my own small business, reaching out to local commissaries to inquire about capabilities in hosting me as a startup, getting my own at-home blast freezer, developing relationships with my restaurant contacts to get placement in their venues, and putting together an ice cream class that I myself will teach where I\u2019ve previously been volunteering.  So very successful all around.\n\nHope the above write-up was helpful; best of luck to future classes and attendees.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1igbyao/penn_state_ice_cream_101_introduction_to_frozen/", "created_utc": 1738541689.0, "score": 85, "author": "jt15550", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1igbyao/penn_state_ice_cream_101_introduction_to_frozen/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Dark chocolate ice cream - review of available recipes", "selftext": "# Intro\n\nI've been thinking recently a lot about *\"Dark Chocolate Ice Cream\"*. This is my favorite ice cream style. At some point I started comparing recipes and they turned out unexpectedly different. I wanted to share the comparison with you.\n\n# Updates:\n\nAfter writing this article, I updated the table with more recipes. Some of the text below may be outdated because of that.\n\n# What is dark chocolate?\n\nBefore we get to ice cream, what is \"dark chocolate\"? Reddit is a multi-cultural place after all and the definition that I'm used to may not be universal. While writing this post I did some research and it seems that the worldwide reality is...complex.\n\n* I used to think that \"over 70%\" cocoa solids is considered dark,\n* A few countries have labeling requirements for that, they all say that chocolate must have \"at least 35% cocoa solids\". Others don't have requirements specific to \"dark\", so \"dark\" chocolate equals \"chocolate\" there. It often means that the requirement is even weaker,\n* I've seen various people expressing their own definitions ranging from 50% to 100%.\n\nI will keep using my definition but without pretension of it being more or less right than any other. I like it and it's not far from many others so it may mislead some...but few.\n\n# What is dark chocolate ice cream?\n\nTo me, the intuitive definition would be *\"ice cream that tastes like dark chocolate\"*.  \nBut...I've tried a few chocolate ice creams. I've tried a few dark chocolates. These experiences don't match. Every chocolate ice cream recipe that I've tried is sweet. Dark chocolate is either barely sweet or not at all. Furthermore, most dark chocolate ice cream recipes call for milk ingredients, which is rare (but not unheard of) in the world of dark chocolate.\n\nThis discrepancy has led me to a thought that it would be useful to look at the sweetness-bitterness balance. In simple chocolate that is just cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and sugar, the balance is easy and correlates well with cocoa content. Knowing cocoa content we can have a good idea of how sweet a chocolate is (as long as there are no additives like milk). What if we calculated the sweetness-bitterness balance of ice cream? And from the balance, calculated back to \"as sweet as X% chocolate\"? Would that be a useful as an ice cream parameter? I think that it won't work as well as with chocolate, but nevertheless I feel it is the best single parameter that comes to my mind. I will now call this sweetness-bitterness balance \"Theoretical chocolate %\".\n\n# How to calculate Theoretical Chocolate % ?\n\nFirst, sum up cocoa-solids-nonfat (CSNF) of the cocoa and chocolate products in your recipe. Express that as % of the total recipe weight.  \nThen calculate sweetness as % of sucrose.  \nFrom my ingredients database it seems that typical chocolate has 46% CSNF and 54% cocoa butter, calculated as a percentage of cocoa solids (not as a percentage of the entire bar). I use that for the theoretical chocolate.  \nWith that, the theoretical chocolate percentage = (100/46\\*CSNF)/(sweetness+(100/46\\*CSNF))\\*100\n\nBTW, I did not correct for the fact that we tend to eat ice cream cold and chocolate at room temperatures. This affects sweetness perception. Temperature alone will make ice cream feel less sweet than chocolate of equivalent %. I would like to make this correction but I don't know how to.\n\n# What other properties affect ice cream taste?\n\nDark chocolate ice cream recipes differ in more than just sweetness-to-bitterness ratio. A few other significant properties are:\n\n* Amount of cocoa. Or precisely, cocoa solids nonfat (CSNF) which is the flavoring ingredient. You can have ice cream that's very sweet and very chocolatey at the same time. At the extreme, chocolate ice cream can taste far more chocolatey than chocolate itself (due to faster spread of cocoa solids in the mouth). Some like this effect (I do). Most prefer their ice cream to be milder.\n* What exact chocolate and cocoa do you use...but this is typically your choice, not the recipe author's.\n* Amount of milk ingredients. It's a big deal as well, there are sorbets with no milk at all and ice creams that are indeed very milky. I am not sure whether all milk ingredients matter to the same extent. I decided to focus on milk-solids-nonfat (MSNF) as its a close analogy to CSNF. But maybe it would be better to think about milk-solids-including-fat instead? I don't know. Anyway....I decided to look as a MSNF-to-CSNF ratio as it has more impact on taste than MSNF alone.\n* Other flavoring ingredients. Vanilla, nuts, chilli, coffee, cherry, banana, raisins, salt, cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, rum, rosemary, mustard, smoke, garlic just to name a few. That's too much to cover for me, so I will mostly ignore this topic now.\n* Fat percent, total solids affect mouthfeel. The former also affect flavor release (higher fat ice cream will be less intense but the flavor will last longer). Am I missing something important?\n\n# The recipes table\n\nIn the table below you can see a summary of a few recipes that I selected. I focused on the ones labelled dark and the ones that just have a lot of cocoa in them, but I didn't limit myself to them. Similarly I focused on the recipes that I've seen recommended, but I did not limit myself to them. One caveat of this table is that the recipes are not pure math as the ingredients have some variability. One notable decision is that unless the authors were precise in the chocolate % recommendations, I assumed that dark chocolate meant 90%, bittersweet 70%, semisweet 50%. YMMV. Don't treat this table as absolute truth, more like a ballpark.\n\n|Author|Recipe|Theo chocolate %|CSNF %|MSNF/CSNF|Fat %|Total Solids %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Taric250|[Chocolate Gelato](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1jql6fa/chocolate_gelato_recipe_calculated_written_and/)|65|10.9|0.94|3.9|42|\n|Underbelly|[\u201cSingle Origin\u201d Chocolate Ice Cream](https://under-belly.org/ice-cream-flavor-chocolate/)|59|8.8|0.93|15|46|\n|Underbelly|[\u201cDouble Origin\u201d Chocolate Ice Cream](https://under-belly.org/ice-cream-flavor-chocolate/)|58|9|0.55|15.5|43.1|\n|Max Falkovitz|[The Darkest Dark Chocolate](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-dark-chocolate-ice-cream-recipe)|54-61|7.5-9.5|0.67-0.5|11-12.6|38.7-41.2|\n|David Lebovitz|[Chocolate Sorbet](https://food52.com/recipes/17877-david-lebovitz-s-chocolate-sorbet)|51|12.1|0|7.1|44.4|\n|Marie Asselin|[Dark Chocolate Gelato](https://foodnouveau.com/dark-chocolate-gelato/)|50|7.7|0.66|12.5|41.8|\n|Pacojet|[Chocolate Sorbet Vegan](https://pacojet.com/en-GB/Recipes/Ice-cream-and-sorbet/Chocolate-Sorbet-Vegan/)|49|10.7|0|6.7|38.8|\n|Stella Parks|[Devil\u2019s Food](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/devils-food-chocolate-ice-cream-recipe-bravetart-stella-parks/)|48|9.1|0.37|18.8|54.5|\n|Katie Bracco / ihavetities|[Chocolate with Kidney Beans](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1f93pzo/i_tried_the_chocolate_with_kidney_beans_recipe/)|47|5|0|2.8|27.7|\n|Humphry Slocombe|[Chocolate Smoked Salt Ice Cream](https://honestcooking.com/chocolate-smoked-salt-ice-cream/)|47|6.5|0.55|19.9|47|\n|buttermilkbysam|[Midnight Chocolate Ice Cream](https://buttermilkbysam.com/midnight-chocolate-ice-cream/)|47|6.8|0.68|19|46.6|\n|Pacojet|[Chocolate Ice Cream](https://pacojet.com/en-GB/Recipes/Ice-cream-and-sorbet/Chocolate-Ice-Cream/)|43|7.6|0.47|21|52.9|\n|Siliquy8|[Dark chocolate gelato](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/148psj7/dark_chocolate_gelato/)|40|7|0.69|10.4|45.2|\n|iahoover|[Uber dark chocolate](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1donoo2/uber_dark_chocolate/)|39|5.6|1.6|11.8|45.9|\n|Ruben Porto|[Chocolate Ice Cream](https://www.icecreamscience.com/blog/chocolate-ice-cream-recipe)|36|4.3|2.5|19.8|46.8|\n|Jeni Britton-Bauer|[The Darkest Chocolate Ice Cream in the World](https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/The-Darkest-Chocolate-Ice-Cream-in-the-World/)|35|4.8|1.15|10.9|40.2|\n|Laura|[Best Homemade Chocolate Ice Cream](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/chocolate-ice-cream/)|34|4.8|0.88|20.7|49.7|\n|Sweetlo123|[The Best Chocolate Ice Cream of My (and possibly your) Life](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1gw1vp9/the_best_chocolate_ice_cream_of_my_and_possibly/)|33|4.3|1.56|14.9|47.9|\n|Sweetlo123|[Chocolate Frozen Yogurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hxlveo/chocolate_frozen_yogurt/)|31|4.6|1.3|15.3|49.3|\n|Morgan Bolling|[Dark Chocolate No-Churn Ice Cream](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/11755-dark-chocolate-no-churn-ice-cream)|19|3.4|2.1|21.9|61.7|\n\n# Some high level summary:\n\n* Judging by sweetness-to-bitterness, I will call the darkest ice cream recipes I've seen bittersweet. I haven't seen a single one I would classify as dark.\n* Regardless of what property you look at, the range of values here is very high. There are huge differences between recipes and recommendations mean little in the sense that I suspect that whatever recipe you  take, some will consider it awful. If you're a newbie to chocolate ice cream making and make a random recommended recipe, you may hate it. If that happens, don't worry. There are surely others that you will find more appealing and the table above may guide you in the right direction.\n\n# Comments about recipes\n\n1. Underbelly has a couple of recipes, one based on cocoa powder and the other on chocolate with added cocoa. These recipes are the darkest by the sweetness-bitterness ratio. Sweetness is relatively low, cocoa content is relatively high but both parameters are far from extreme. One thing that surprised me was that they are very different from each other when it comes to milk content. I have no idea why.\n2. Max Falkovitz's \"The Darkest Dark Chocolate\". Oh boy, this guy can write. But if I see a promise of \"the darkest chocolate\" for \"the hardcore chocolate fans\", I expect it to be like...dark chocolate. And not just just barely dark but close to 100% dark. This one doesn't seem dark. Not even barely dark, just bittersweet. Max, you have disappointed me. That said, this recipe is quite unique in that it uses cocoa brew (it cooks cocoa nibs in milk and them removes them). I am unable to predict the extraction yield as well or amount of milk removed with the nibs, that's why you see a range. I have a hunch that the actual numbers are closer to those on the left. Another noteworthy feature is the amount of salt. Max likes his chocolate salty.\n3. David Lebovitz's sorbet is...interesting. Extreme amount of cocoa. No milk to make it milder. But also extreme sweetness. Overall, very intense bittersweet flavor.\n4. Katie Bracco made a recipe that became popular in the ninjacreami sub. I was unable to calculate its properties reasonably well. But for a variant made by ihavetities I could. And I did. It turned out as having extremely low fat and solids content (no wonder for a low calorie recipe). Not much cocoa, but not much sweetness either which made it indeed relatively dark.\n5. Jeni's \"The darkest chocolate in the world\". For me, it's a fascinating recipe. Fascinating, because the name is very misleading, it's not dark by any measure that comes to my mind but nevertheless it's recommended a lot. And people indeed say it's dark. Are used to very mild chocolates or is there an element of suggestion? I don't know. Regardless, there are 2 noteworthy features. It uses cream cheese as emulsifier, a technique that Jeni pioneered and others picked up. It is also relatively low fat, more like gelato than ice cream from the USA.\n6. Morgan Bolling's \"Dark Chocolate No-Churn Ice Cream\" is the most extreme chocolate ice cream by so many metrics. The highest sweetness, by a significant margin. The highest total solids. The highest fat content. And the lowest amount of cocoa. If I didn't calculate it I wouldn't believe people make ice cream with so much sugar and fat. And I wouldn't believe they call them \"dark chocolate\". But apparently they do.\n\n# Final word\n\nIf you've made this far...any comments or suggestions?  \nWhere in this range does your favorite dark chocolate ice cream fall?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1icobii/dark_chocolate_ice_cream_review_of_available/", "created_utc": 1738134888.0, "score": 34, "author": "Civil-Finger613", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1icobii/dark_chocolate_ice_cream_review_of_available/", "html_title": ""}

Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker. Turn on the machine. Churn just until the mixture has the texture of soft-serve (timing ranges, depending on the machine).\nQuickly transfer the ice cream to freezer-friendly containers: Spoon in a layer of ice cream, sprinkle on the almond brittle and salted ganache, and use a spoon to press them in gently. Repeat.\nCover with parchment paper, pressing it to the surface of the ice cream so it adheres, then cover with a lid. It\u2019s okay if the parchment hangs over the rim. Store it in the coldest part of your freezer (farthest from the door) until firm, at least 6 hours. It will keep for up to 2 months.\nAlmond Brittle:\n\nLine a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\nCombine the sugar, corn syrup, and \u00bc cup water in a medium saucepan and stir until all of the sugar looks wet. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the syrup comes to a simmer, about 3 minutes.\nContinue to cook, this time covered and without stirring, until the mixture has thickened slightly, about 3 more minutes. Add the butter and salt, and stir well. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and continue to cook, gently and constantly stirring, until the mixture registers 290\u00b0F on the thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the heat, and quickly but thoroughly stir in the almonds, baking soda, and vanilla (watch it all bubble!), doing your best to distribute the nuts throughout the sticky mixture. Immediately (like, super quick!) pour the mixture onto the lined sheet pan and use a butter knife or a metal spatula to spread it out to a relatively even layer that\u2019s just under \u00bc inch thick. Let the brittle sit uncovered until it has cooled to room temperature, about 1 hour. Then use your hands to break it into irregular bite-size (about \u00bc- to \u00bd-inch) pieces.\nStore them in an airtight container in the freezer until you\u2019re ready to use them as a mix-in (or to simply eat them) for up to 3 months. There\u2019s no need to defrost the pieces before using them in the ice cream\n\nSalted Ganache:\nCombine the cream and sugar in a medium saucepan, stir well, and bring the mixture to a bare simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate and salt, and let it sit, stirring and scraping the pan occasionally, until the chocolate begins to melt, about 2 minutes.\nUse a sturdy whisk to vigorously stir until the chocolate has completely melted and the mixture becomes smooth and satiny, about 1 minute. Congratulations, you just made ganache!\n\nTransfer the ganache to an airtight container and store it in the freezer for at least 2 hours or up to 1 month. There\u2019s no need to defrost it before using. \n\nIce Cream Base:\n\nCombine the sugar, dry milk, and xanthan gum in a small bowl and stir well. Pour the corn syrup into a medium pot and stir in the whole milk. Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary, to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.\n\nAdd the cream and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours. Stir the base back together if it separates during the resting time. The base can be further stored in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

Again, never had any issue with ice so I know my base ratios are good. \n\nSo where does this recipe differ from my standard recipe? I wanted to make a toffee flavor. I achieved this by melting butter and mixing in light *brown* sugar (the normal weight for my base) then kept stirring until my toffee just barely hit 350F and I then poured the milk and cream directly onto the toffee to quickly cool it. I've used this same method to make caramel flavored ice cream (replacing the butter with water and brown sugar with white) to great success which gave me confidence with this method. My experience making caramel ice cream taught me that the caramel loses sweetness (I think because the sugar is becoming- not sugar anymore) so I added in more brown sugar (via making a custard of sugar and egg yolks). Knowing that I'd be adding in extra fat because this recipe uses butter, I calculated how much milk I could add (no cream) to arrive at the same fat % as my normal base. Flavor wise, I think this was actually a success. I got a strong toffee flavor and the sweetness level was good so I think I added in the right amount of sugar.\n\n I'm not really sure why the texture didn't work out. Again, the fat % and sweetness levels are the same as my normal base. The only things I can think of are:\n1. Maybe brown sugar isn't as good for the texture as white sugar so, I need to add more brown sugar or swap out some of the brown with white (which I'd rather not do since the flavor was delicious).\n2. Maybe because the butter is being turned into toffee, the fat isn't actually fat anymore so, my fat % is lower than what I'm calculating. Problem is, I have no idea how much fat I'm losing. Is it 20%? 100%? This is probably what I will try changing first, by replacing some of the milk with cream. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience making similar recipes?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1i67jew/icy_gelato_help_has_butter_toffee_flavor/", "created_utc": 1737424358.0, "score": 1, "author": "Trollselektor", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1i67jew/icy_gelato_help_has_butter_toffee_flavor/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I recently got the ice cream attachment for my ankarsrum mixer and I\u2019m still trying to figure it out. \n\nThis is my second time trying the machine and first time making sorbet. Last time I made a white chocolate ice cream and I didn\u2019t really like it. It was too airy which made it feel like eating whipped cream. I had the machine on medium low spinning speed which thinking back was maybe the reason for the airy texture. Hence when making the sorbet I wanted to keep the speed low and use a stabiliser and so this time I left the machine on the lowest speed. The result was a very dense sorbet. I used gelatine as a stabiliser. But yeah, I was quite happy with the result. The flavour was good, texture was good; maybe it could have used some lemon juice. \n\nThe recipe:\nFrozen strawberries 600 g\nPowdered sugar\n100 g caster sugar\n2 leafs of gelatin soaked in cold water\n\nRoast the strawberries on a baking tray and dust them with some powdered sugar and bale at 180C until they start to release their juices and the strawberries become dark but not black.

They weighed around 300 g in the end. \nPut them in a saucepan with the juices and the sugar and bring to a boil.

Luscious chocolate ice cream paired with toasty walnuts and mini marshmallows (pictured here) or homemade marshmallow fluff (recipe included). Happy New Year all! Let me know if you have any questions! \n\nSweet Lo\u2019s Rocky Road\n\nYield: about 1.5 quarts \n\n1 \u00bd cup (357g) heavy cream\n3 tbsp (22.5g) cocoa powder \n\u2154 cup / 5 ounces (142g) semi-sweet + bittersweet chocolate chips*\n1 \u00bd cup (368g) whole milk \n\u00bc cup (33g) nonfat dry milk powder \n\u2154 cup + 1 tbsp (150g) white sugar \n\u00bd tsp (2.6g) salt \n3 (54g) egg yolks\n\u00bc tsp (1.1g) good quality vanilla extract \n\n*I use 3.6oz (102g) semi-sweet chips (43%) + 1.4oz (40g) bittersweet chips (63%). Feel free to adjust these levels to your liking. \n\n3oz (85g) toasted walnuts (recipe below)\n\n1 cup (about 55g) mini marshmallows \n\nAND / OR\n\n 1 \u00bd cups (weigh) homemade marshmallow fluff (recipe below)\n\nBefore starting, set aside a medium sized bowl (one with a lid) with a fine mesh strainer on top.\n\n1. In a medium-sized, heavy bottom saucepan add the heavy cream, cocoa powder and (both) chocolate chips. Heat on medium low, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and the cocoa is incorporated.\n2. Pour this mixture into the medium-sized bowl and set a mesh strainer on top of it.\n3. In the same saucepan (do not clean out!) add the whole milk, nonfat milk powder, sugar and salt. Heat on medium low, stirring occasionally, until the dry ingredients have incorporated into the milk.\n4. While the ingredients are warming, carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and put the yolks in a small bowl. Give the yolks a quick whisk so they will be easier to incorporate into the dairy. Discard the whites or save them for another use down the road.\n5. Once the milk mixture is combined and all the ingredients are incorporated, slowly add in your egg yolks, stirring constantly. Turn the heat to medium. \n6. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, registering about 175 degrees on an instant read thermometer. This will take about 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately pour mixture through the fine mesh strainer into the heavy cream / chocolate mixture and give a good stir. Allow the base to cool at room temperature for an hour. Stir in the vanilla extract.\n7. Add the lid to the bowl and set in the refrigerator to age overnight.\n8. Toast your walnuts and make your marshmallow fluff, if you are using. \n9. When you are ready to churn, pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.\n10. To assemble your Rocky Road Ice Cream: Scoop your churned chocolate ice cream from the ice cream maker into a medium sized bowl. Quickly stir in your toasted walnuts and mini marshmallows. Scoop into your container and cover with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nIf you are using marshmallow fluff: Scoop your churned chocolate ice cream from the ice cream maker into a medium sized bowl. Quickly stir in the toasted walnuts. Next, dollop spoonfuls of it over the chocolate / walnut ice cream and get some of the fluff along with some ice cream on the paddle as you scoop it into your container. Repeat this process, adding more fluff as you go, to your liking. Once complete, cover the container with a piece of patty wax or parchment paper before placing the lid on. Freeze until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. For best results, allow it to harden overnight before digging in. \n\nToasted Walnuts \nYield: about \u2154 cup walnuts \n\nPlace \u2154 cup raw walnuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and toast at 350 degrees for 6 minutes. After 6 minutes, take the walnuts out and sprinkle them generously with salt. Give the walnuts a shake, rotate the pan and toast for an additional 3 minutes. When they are toasty and fragrant smelling, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool completely. Give them a rough chop before placing them in a jar until ready to use. \n\nMarshmallow Fluff\nYield: about 1 \u00be cups fluff \n\n3 (126g) egg whites\n\u00be cup (150g) white sugar\n\u00bc tsp (1.1g) cream of tartar\nSplash of vanilla extract \n\nWhisk the egg whites and sugar for 2-3 minutes in a double boiler or a nonreactive bowl set over a small pot of simmering water.\nAs soon as the sugar is fully dissolved into the egg whites and the mixture is warm, transfer to a bowl of a stand mixer.\nWhisk on medium high speed for about 2 minutes, then add in the cream of tartar and splash of vanilla extract, just when the egg whites are turning from translucent to opaque. \nContinue whisking for an additional 5-7 minutes, making a thick, stiff marshmallow fluff. \nTransfer marshmallow fluff to a jar with a lid and keep at room temperature until ready to use, up to two weeks. \nGet ready to dollop spoonfuls of fluff into your churned chocolate + walnut ice cream. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y5sic0n62p9e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1735437330.0, "score": 106, "author": "Sweetlo123", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1holazg/classic_rocky_road/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Ice cream newbie- some UK help please :)", "selftext": "Hi, \nI've been making ice cream since April. I've got a cuisinart ICE150,and have mainly used web based recipes and then adapted them intuitively for different ingredients. Everything so far has worked out really well and been well received. I've had people who don't usually like ice cream asking for batches because they've finally had one they like. \nI bought HMNIIC and made a few of the mix ins/ sauces. To be honest, I wasn't massively impressed with them flavour wise, but I wasn't sure if that's maybe because some of our flavours are quite distinctively different in the UK, compared to the US. \nPreviously, I've not used any stabilisers and all my recipes have been custard based. I've started experimenting (as per recipe) with the ones in the book and they all seem to result in curdled ice cream. Making my usual recipes, I don't get any splitting or bits of yolk in my finished base, but I seem to be getting these greasy looking bases which just don't look as good as my usual bases do. I've been playing with the philly style ice creams too, and they also look gross- like thin and weird as if you've mixed soft cream cheese and icing sugar. I'm batch making a load for Christmas presents (maybe not the time to have been trying new recipes!) so haven't churned any yet, but I'm wary of what they're going to be like. I'm really hoping I haven't just wasted 4 days in the kitchen  \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nI tried to compare my usual recipes to the functional ratios in the back of the book and some seem quite different. I'm aware that there's a difference between UK / US heavy cream (we call it double here, and it's about 50% bf). I'm wondering if there are other differences too, which might have an impact. \n\nFinally, when it comes to adding fruit, I'm using the bubblegum recipe as the basis for a cherry ice cream, but the functional ratios, whilst being intended to allow the reader to use the formula to make any ice cream from scratch, doesn't really give any info on how you account for water content of a puree, or the fruit sugar content (or does that not matter?). \n\nAny light that can be shed would be appreciated :) thanks! \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hkzyaq/ice_cream_newbie_some_uk_help_please/", "created_utc": 1734995310.0, "score": 2, "author": "Ellabee83", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1hkzyaq/ice_cream_newbie_some_uk_help_please/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Finding the best vanilla bean paste for ice cream", "selftext": "This is less of a recipe and more of an exploration, although I hope it's still okay to post in this category; it's what I was looking for when I first got started. I use a 2:1 ratio of cream to milk but I don't think the base ratio matters too much.  The important part is that I added the pastes into my base once it had cooled to room temperature.\n\nMy goal is to perfect my vanilla recipe. Picard used to carry this jaundice-yellow vanilla ice cream and it tasted like magic but they discontinued it (to spite me) and I can never forgive them. But now I'm an adult with an ice cream maker and a vengeance, so here we are.\n\nVanilla, despite being so common and banal is such a wierd, interesting, impossible product. However (and despite evidence below to the contrary), I'm not made of money so I'm starting with pastes. The speckles do something for me that's hard to explain.\n\nEnter \\[stage left\\] the pastes:\n\n1. Trader Joe's Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste\n2. Trader Joe's Organic Vanilla Bean Paste\n3. Simply Organic Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste\n4. Blue Cattle Truck Trading Co. Mexican Vanilla Bean Paste\n5. Tahitian Gold 3-Bean Blend Whole Vanilla Bean Paste\n6. Heilala Pure Vanilla Paste\n7. Nielson Massey Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nBefore I go into each, the biggest thing I noticed about working with pastes is that they have a lot of added sugar. That means if you don't want things too sweet (like me) you're going to need to compensate. The bottles rarely have the amount of sugar per serving in grams so you might need to look that up. I found that I had to overcompensate but that might be because I use organic sugar which is less sweet in my experience.\n\nOnline vanilla reviews tend to focus around them in baked goods which doesn't translate well to ice cream where we're not challenging the flavor with heat. Anytime a vanilla was described as \"subtle\" or \"weak\" by reviewers, the better suited I thought it might be for ice cream.\n\n# Trader Joe's Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nThis is the one that started the journey. It was letting me down and I craved something better. But when I measure it out and add it in, it gloops together like a cartoon rain drop and doesn't stick to the spoon which is 10/10.\n\n# Trader Joe's Organic Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nSolid. I liked this best when I matched it with a tablespoon of dark rum. If you're here for the reasonable recommendation that's not too expensive, generally pleasing, and is easy to get (assuming you live near a Trader Joe's) this is it. For the rest of us annoying folks, I will move on.\n\n# Simply Organic Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nThis is a great choice if you're having people over and you want to flex on them that you make ice cream from scratch now. This one was the most delicious straight out of the ice cream maker and still good \\~24 hours later. However, it did lose its flavor after about 36-48 hours. You also need to be careful of how much you put in. When I tried to overcompensate for its subtle flavor, I found it tasted \"fake\" which I think means I could taste the additives they put in to give it the gloop. Even when not overcompensating, you have to use a lot and it's not a large container and it's kind of expensive...\n\n# Blue Cattle Truck Trading Co. Mexican Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nThe vanilla bean plant is from Mexico and that's the only place with the native bees that pollinate it. Other (\\*cough\\* french-colonized \\*cough\\*) countries that grows this has to hand-pollinate it in order to get it to grow the bean. It's no wonder the bean itself is expensive but still incredible how common it is.\n\nThis tastes like candy more than vanilla. One person said it tasted like cotton candy, but I think it tastes like marshmallows, but like marshmallows from the 1950s when I wasn't even alive. It was also very sweet even after reducing the sugar a lot. It's good if you're into that kind of thing, but suspicious for implanting false memories.\n\n# Tahitian Gold 3-Bean Blend Whole Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nGoddamit I was trying to buy a pure Tahitian vanilla bean paste and didn't read the listing well enough. This combines beans from Tahiti, Madagascar, and Papua New Guinea. Madagascar vanilla beans are incredibly musky and strong which means they're great for baking (musk reduces in heat) but using it raw in ice cream gives you full-on musk which (imo) distracts from the \"actual\" vanilla flavor. That's why I was trying to get Tahitian vanilla beans which tend to be more subtle. This one wasn't too musky but it would have been less so...if I could read!\n\nThis is very bourbon-y (as advertised). It tasted better when added 1:1 with a bourbon-y dark rum that further brought out its bourbon-y-ness. This tasted slightly bitter straight out of the machine but mellowed out beautifully after 24 hours curing.\n\nOut of all these pastes, this one actually smelled like actual vanilla bean, which made me think it's higher quality but \"has smelled vanilla beans\" is my only credential to judge this so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n# Heilala Pure Vanilla Paste\n\nThis one marketed to my millenial heart but while I appreciate the company's dedication to the Kingdom of Tonga, the product itself is only okay. It's a solid pick but the flavor seemed to disappear quickly, similar to the Simply Organics without beating it in terms of initial deliciousness.\n\n# Nielson Massey Vanilla Bean Paste\n\nI tried this one after it came so highly recommended by commenters and I have it way too many chances since it was literally everyone's favorite. My honest opinion, particularly compared with others on this list, is that it's fine. I might actually prefer the Heilala. The brand just seems to have a choke hold on this subreddit in a very guerilla marketing kind of way.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFor me, there was no clear winner and so I will likely continue trying out different ones and posting updates. However, I still have 5 varyingly full containers of vanilla paste and an objectively good sense of fun so I thought the best way to find a winner would be for them to fight it out.\n\nI assumed mixing all 5 pastes would result in something I could describe only as \"vanilla\" but, surprisingly, you can really taste the different pastes. The flavor was constantly changing throughout the churning process. Although the Mexican vanilla along with the Trader Joe's Bourbon stood out at the very beginning, by the time I was done churning the Tahitian Gold really took the lead supported by the Simply Organics and Heilala. After a few hours of curing, the Mexican vanilla came back in with a vengeance only to be beaten out by...no one. What I'm saying is that I didn't like the Mexican vanilla one that much and it comes off far too strong in ice cream. I should have known when I saw how people praised it online. In retrospect, perhaps I was actualy looking for the loser in the fight or maybe second last. Anyways, the search continues...\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nVanilla Bean paste is just not a good option for ice cream. The extra gunk and sugar they put in there to give it the goop comes through far too clearly and there is no good option.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hjojcl/finding_the_best_vanilla_bean_paste_for_ice_cream/", "created_utc": 1734832013.0, "score": 15, "author": "DigitalAntagonist", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1hjojcl/finding_the_best_vanilla_bean_paste_for_ice_cream/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Toasted Milk Ice Cream- Need help with the milk powder", "selftext": "I'm currently using the Day with Mei recipe with personal adjustments to the base. Basically all i'm really taking from the recipe is the amount of milk powder used for 1qt and the sugar caramelization process.\n\nAnyhow, so far i've attempted this recipe twice, with both attempts having issues. The first attempt had GREAT flavor.... but was grainy due to the milk powder. So for the second attempt, I stirred together the milk and toasted milk powder separately on the stove, then strained it through a coffee filter. This left a bunch of grainy gunk which I assumed was the powder. I also assumed that even though this gunk was left behind, the flavor of the toasted milk still steeped into the milk: It did not. My ice cream ended up just tasting like caramel from the sugar caramelization step, with little to no toasted milk flavor. \n\nI'm not sure how to fix this powdered milk issue. My only theory is that the brand of powder is the issue, which i'm using the Saco Pantry brand (besides this brand, the only other brand at my store is a generic.) The next thing I can think of attempting is maybe letting the toasted milk powder steep in the milk overnight, though i'm not sure if that'll add much more flavor. \n\nDoes anyone have experience making this type of ice cream flavor? Any tips or advice? Thanks!\n\nEdit; also just checked and the powder is skim milk. Could this be the issue?

{"title": "Getting perfect structure and hardness in Italian gelato", "selftext": "Hi, I have been making a lot of different ice creams the past year and I am trying to perfect a vanilla gelato ice cream (with eggs in this case) I used this recipe from Angelo Corvitto's book:\n\nFull fat milk 547g\n35% cream 86g\nSkimmed milk powder 49g\nDextrose 148\nEgg yolks 100g\nSucrose 50g\nInverted sugar 20g\n\nFor a 1000g mix this is 8% fat. Using skimmed milk powder really seems like an improvement. I also added ~0.75g tara gum, even though the book only recommends stabilizer for recipes without eggs. The ice cream tasted great and had a very good texture and mouthfeel, but was just a bit too soft when coming out of the freezer.\n\nI measured my ice cream temperature and it is -15\u00b0C when stored. I realized the sugar content is relatively high which increases the freezing temperature and this may cause the softness. So, my first step will be to reduce the dextrose/sucrose ratio.\n\nThis is all clear, but what I am conflicted about is the added benefit (if there is) to using stabilizers. I am wondering if it can make the ice too soft if you already have eggs included. Some say that mainly freezing point determines the softness and stabilizer mainly improves other structural things. However I was thinking if it binds water it might also increase softness? Can anyone explain better? Does it have any added benefit to add stabilizers even when having eggs.

{"title": "Inulin is making ice cream grainy and has caramelly off-taste", "selftext": "Hi! I've been using inulin in my sherbets lately at about 3% by weight, just to add a little bit of extra texture. \n\nBut the problem I've been encountering is that the inulin doesn't dissolve well in the base, and it adds a strong off taste, kinda like something it slightly burnt or like caramel (not in a good way). I am constantly stirring the pot to avoid burning anything, but this flavor is still here. It may just be part of the inulin and not from cooking it.\n\n  \nHas anyone else had this experience? My first guess is that both issues are from the inulin getting too much moisture in the bag I store it in, as it's clumped up quite a bit. That could have caused the taste to go off before the best-by date, and maybe also made it not dissolve well. Right?\n\nHere's the recipe I used most recently, but it's happening with everything I've used it in lately. I don't remember this happening when I first started using it, but I may be misremembering. \n\n* 270g milk\n* 100g heavy cream\n* 100g buttermilk\n* 120g sugar\n* 30g dextrose\n* 30g milk powder\n* 30g inulin\n\n  \nHeat all that until it comes to a simmer, then remove from heat and I added 3g black tea, steeped for 6 minutes, then strained.\n\n  \nThen, add the base from above to the following:\n\n* 270g persimmon puree\n* 2.5g citric acid\n* A generous pinch of salt\n\nThen I refrigerated overnight, added 1g guar gum, 0.5g xanthan gum via. blender, then churned.\n\n  \nBut the graininess and off-flavor was present while heating the base, before it even got to a simmer and before I added any fruit puree.\n\nThis is the brand I bought: [https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Naturals-Organic-Prebiotic-Smoothies/dp/B0BVC8HGNH/](https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Naturals-Organic-Prebiotic-Smoothies/dp/B0BVC8HGNH/)\n\n  \nShould I try another brand of inulin, or is it likely just moisture damage that caused it to go bad quickly?

{"title": "High Alcohol Ice Cream Troubleshooting", "selftext": "**Good Day Everyone!**\n\nBefore I start, for the  sake of this post, I'm going to us the term \"churn\" to refer to  the mixture thickening up and freezing  whilst the ice cream maker is...Churning away I guess.\n\nRecently I have been exploring high alcohol ice cream making, inspired by a company named Tipsy Scoops out of New York. Essentially they make really alcoholic ice cream, we're talking 5% or 10 proof for two scoops. I was kinda stunned  that the founder was able to  make ice cream with that much alcohol in it and still get the mixture to  churn. \n\nI have been giving it a shot with a few different flavours and  I'm experiencing  two issues -\n\n1 -  The mixture isint churning in my ice cream maker (Krups GVS-1). It stays liquid,  perhaps thickening a bit, but nowhere near actually resembling ice cream.\n\n2 -  The mixture does freeze when I pour it into a container and  chuck it into a traditional home freezer  but  I'm getting  an insane amount of icing, I'm talking a plethora of medium sized ice  crystals  throughout the frozen mixture.\n\nThe flavour is banging but the texture leaves a bit to be desired, so I'm trying to figure out exactly what the issue is, why I'm getting these issues and thats where I could use anyone's input.\n\n I'm thinking that because my mixture isint churning at  all,  that might be  the main culprit?\n\nI'm also  thinking that I'm making this stuff in summer, in South Africa so we're talking perhaps 26C at night 78F, perhaps hotter on occasion. So the ambient temp might  be playing havok with the much higher freezing point needed to freeze this stuff?\n\nI am kinda perplexed considering that amount of alcohol would obliterate any form of ice crystallization, I would think at least.\n\nThe woman who runs Tipsy Scoops has done some videos where she makes a  recipe in  a home ice cream maker and it seems to churn somewhat normally. I will see if I can link the video in the comments, but one can Google \"Tipsy Scoop\u2019s Founder Shows Us How to Make Boozy Ice-Cream at Home,\" and it should pop right up.\n\nI  have tried both her recipe and my recipe both have the same issues.\n\n**Tipsy Scoops Recipe -**\n\n1 \u00bd cups whole milk\n\n1 \u00bd cups heavy cream\n\n1 tablespoon vanilla\n\n1/3 cup sugar\n\n8 egg yolks\n\n6 cups Ice Cream Mix\n\n1/4 cup Cinnamon\n\n1 tablespoon Melted Butter\n\n1 cup Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum  (I used Bacardi White, its the same volume/proof)\n\n**And my recipe** (I have made this recipe, a orange Creamsicle with fresh juice and cream and a chocolate recipe which was mostly milk with cocoa powder, all have the same issue) -\n\n1Kg  Strawberries\n\n150ml cream\n\n80g Medium fat milk powder\n\n100g Pectin\n\n2g Xanthan gum\n\n70ml glucose\n\n100g white sugar\n\n100g invert sugar \n\n20ml lemon juice\n\n175ml Bacardi white rum 40 percent/80 proof \n\nPinch of salt\n\nLeave  to thicken up overnight and then churn the next day.\n\n\\-----\n\nWell theres my monolith of text, thank you for reading and thank you  to anyone who might be able  to help :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1h5ibhx/high_alcohol_ice_cream_troubleshooting/", "created_utc": 1733212007.0, "score": 6, "author": "DesignerAtoms", "num_comments": 47, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1h5ibhx/high_alcohol_ice_cream_troubleshooting/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Help with frozen yogurt for a beginner", "selftext": "I got a cuisinart ice cream maker on sale and want to try making frozen yogurt. I want to keep a simple recipe\n\n\\- I have a yogurt culture that gives sweetish, thick, and very creamy yogurt without lumps. I will use this as my starter with full-fat milk. I may add a pint of heavy cream to half gallon milk before culturing.\n\n\\- I am thinking about honey with a bit of Allulose for sweetener\n\n\\- I have frozen berries but probably will make vanilla the first time\n\n\\- I got a thickener from Amazon that has guar gum and carrageenan. I have no idea about thickeners. Are they needed for frozen yogurt? I found many recipes calling for different ones\n\nIf y'all can share experiences from different recipes, whether or not to use thickeners/gellers/emulsifiers and which ones (the choices I saw listed so far included egg yoks, guar/locust gum, xanthan gum, sahlep or konjac root, agar agar, sodium alginate, tapioca, and cornstarch)\n\nI'd like to know what worked for you and what consistency did you get. Any advice is appreciated!\n\nEdit:\n\nI think for frozen yogurt using full fat greek yogurt is a must. Invert sugar (simple syrup) is the easiest and cheapest to make but some can be substituted by allulose for less calories. Making a base seems to yield better results (heated then cooled mix of cream/milk/stabilizers). Guar/xanthan, tapioca starch, or traditional (i.e. salep/konjac & mastic) mixes are all acceptable to use in the base\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idx69awpkp8e1.jpg?width=2882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c614a9060e4cb5b9ea9263df7b0ade675dff6012\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1h5euvz/help_with_frozen_yogurt_for_a_beginner/", "created_utc": 1733198875.0, "score": 4, "author": "flying-sheep2023", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/icecreamery/comments/1h5euvz/help_with_frozen_yogurt_for_a_beginner/", "html_title": ""}
