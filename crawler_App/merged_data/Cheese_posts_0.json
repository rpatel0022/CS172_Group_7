It feels like every post is someone asking about cheese that looks 10000% normal, or has a tiny dot of mold. \n\nDoes it look like this? Yes? Then\u2026 no, it\u2019s not safe to eat. \n\nDoes it have tiny white spots? Yes? Are they literally furry? No? They\u2019re probably crystals, and not only is it safe to eat, but it\u2019s gonna be delicious. \n\nIf you Google the cheese, do the photos show a rind that looks exactly like the one you see on your cheese? Yes? Great, safe to eat the inside. If you google \u201cis the rind on X cheese edible?\u201d does it say yes? Great. You can eat the rind too. \n\nIs it in a tub with milky watery stuff? When you first open it, drain the milky watery stuff and replace it with fresh water. Do this every time you use the cheese. \n\nDoes the watery milky stuff smell sour? Yes? Take the cheese out and rinse it. If it feels slimy or extra mushy, throw it out. If not, smell the cheese. If it also smells sour, throw it out. If it doesn\u2019t, eat it. \n\nIf you see something green/blue/black on your cheese, ask yourself, did I buy cheese that is supposed to have green or blue or black in it? For example, blue cheese has green/blue veins. Pepper Jack has green peppers. Truffle pecorino has truffles in it that look black. \n\nIf it\u2019s not supposed to have any green/blue/black spots, and it does, or it IS supposed to have some green/blue/black spots but they look fuzzy? \n\nCongratulations, you probably have moldy cheese. \n\nIf it\u2019s a soft cheese that you can easily cut with a spoon, I probably would throw it out, unless it\u2019s a tiny dot on a huge piece. (Goat cheese, feta, bocconcini, etc.) \n\nIf it\u2019s semi-hard cheese that you can cut with a regular \u201cpart of my set of cutlery\u201d knife, cut the moldy parts off, with a margin around it. (Pizza mozzarella, cheddar, havarti, Gouda etc.) \n\nIf it\u2019s cheese that you need a sharp proper knife to cut, you can just cut the moldy parts off and eat the rest.

{"title": "Roquefort (Societe) vs Cabrales. Battle of the Heavyweights. Thoughts?", "selftext": "I tried Cabrales for the first time a while ago. I finished 100g of it and I really got to taste it inside and out. The Cabrales was incredible. It was amazing and I'm glad I tasted it.\n\nOn the other hand, Roquefort (Societe) is by far my favorite cheese out there. I eat 100g of it on a weekly basis and I know its' taste by heart.\n\nHere are my thoughts on the two cheeses. I'd love to hear what you guys think if you've ever tried these cheeses. FYI, these are two of the strongest cheeses I've tried so far. Regardless of brand, any Roquefort or Cabrales will stink up an entire room and knock your socks off when you eat it.\n\nOverall Strength of Flavor: Roquefort wins this. Just barely. Both cheeses have the same level of sharpness and pungent flavor. The difference lies in each cheese having an additional tasting note. Roquefort is salty while the Cabrales has a bit of a spicy kick to it. However, the saltiness of the Roquefort far exceeds the spiciness of the Cabrales. The Cabrales has a spicy tasting note, but not on the same level such as a Gorgonzola (Piccante) or even a Provolone (Piccante). Since saltiness is a major factor in what makes a cheese taste strong, the sheer saltiness of the cheese carries the Roquefort past the Cabrales in terms of overall strength of flavor.\n\nComplexity of Flavor: Cabrales wins this and it's not even close. The Roquefort can be described mainly as pungent, salty, and sharp. However, the Cabrales can be described as pungent, sharp, slightly spicy, bitter, and acidic. There's simply more going on in a Cabrales in terms of tasting notes. You're getting a lot more complex flavors.\n\nWhich do I like more?: Roquefort is still my favorite. When I eat a blue cheese, I'm going for pure strength of flavor rather than complexity. I want a cheese that punches me hard in the mouth. Roquefort has a slightly more powerful punch. In addition to this, I'm personally a sucker for cheeses with salty tasting notes. I love Feta, Aged Cheddar, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Pecorino Romano. Then again, comparing these two cheeses is like asking the question \"Who would you rather be punched by? Prime Mike Tyson or Deontay Wilder?\"\n\nConclusion: None of these cheeses are weak. It doesn't matter what brand of Cabrales or Roquefort you choose. You're in for the wildest of rides with any of these cheeses.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jurc8r/roquefort_societe_vs_cabrales_battle_of_the/", "created_utc": 1744153712.0, "score": 13, "author": "joshuamarkrsantos", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jurc8r/roquefort_societe_vs_cabrales_battle_of_the/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I know y'all are sick of hearing about Cougar Gold... But humor me", "selftext": "Okay y'all, I know we're all cheese lovers.\n\nAnd I know y'all are sick of hearing about Cougar Gold.\n\nBut I also see so much misinformation about it that I want to set the record straight. Here are a few things to know about Cougar Gold coming from a student at WSU studying cheese/dairy science. I do not work for the WSU Creamery.\n\n1. Cougar Gold is an aged white cheddar and meets the standards of NATURAL CHEESE (it is not cheese food or processed cheese!). The production process is very similar to every other cheddar production process: the pasteurization of the milk coming from our dairy, the starter culture acidification, the rennet coagulation, curd cooking, draining, cheddaring, etc. The curd is then pressed into the nearly 2 lb wheel overnight, then placed into sterile cans to be sealed. (u/meerkat-fusion elaborated in one of the comments on this!)\n2. Every can of Cougar Gold is aged for at least one year in order for the flavor to develop. There have been modifications over the years to hone in on this flavor, and many studies have been done or are currently being done to better understand this. Yes, cheddars are usually aged with exposure to air, but this storage technique is unique to Cougar Gold and does not cause problems with the sensory perception of the product.\n3. The creamery here is incredibly busy, as they not only make one variety but up to 10 varieties in a year. They also produce ice cream, though that is only sold at the storefront. Production happens during the 5 work days of the week, year-round, and even with that, the Cougar Gold supply is tight.\n4. Cougar Gold can be aged for years with proper refrigeration, as I've seen cans that have held for 10 years and been beautiful once opened. That being said, over time it will become more crumbly, harder in texture, and the distinct cheddar flavors will increase along with the crystal production.\n5. The main defect seen with Cougar Gold is a common one with many cheddars in the past 10+ years: Gas blowing. This happens when cheese is contaminated with a bacteria like *P. wasatchensis*, which is not harmful with consumption but has a nasty habit of producing CO2. This is characterized by a puffy can, and at that point, the cheese is beyond saving. **The creamery will exchange your can though if it does happen!!**\n\nAll this being said, Cougar Gold is a very interesting cheese that was incredibly innovative for the time it was first developed, with a rich history that continues today at WSU. It's great as a snacking cheese, and it's also great when added to say Mac n' Cheese, grilled cheese, or other dishes. If you are international, I do absolutely understand not shelling out the money to get it delivered, because it is just another sharp, aged white cheddar. That being said, if you ever get the chance, at least give it a try\u2764\ufe0f\n\nIf y'all have any questions, please feel free to ask!! I understand that it's a divisive cheese here (this will be the only time I post anything about it), but I love to share the knowledge I've gathered. Go Cougs and have a great week!\n\nEdit: Thanks for my first award\ud83e\udd79\u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jtvi3c/i_know_yall_are_sick_of_hearing_about_cougar_gold/", "created_utc": 1744057898.0, "score": 199, "author": "Kant_Think", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jtvi3c/i_know_yall_are_sick_of_hearing_about_cougar_gold/", "html_title": ""}

Would you mind giving me feedback and correcting my taste findings?", "selftext": "I've done two tasting sessions in my own house.I bought cheese and compared them in order to try to be able to distinguish different types of cheeses. My goals are to be able to learn how different cheeses taste and to be able to distinguish one cheese from another. Here are my thoughts from my two tasting sessions. I'm still new to this and I probably made wrong judgments in terms of taste. I would love some feedback from people who are more experienced in tasting cheese. \n\nSession 1:  Bergeron Lactose-Free Cheese pack containing Cheddar, Swiss, Gouda, and Monterey Jack\n\nTastes and Texture:\n\n1. Cheddar = Firm, Decent Level of Sharpness, same level of sharpness throughout the chewing experience\n2. Swiss = Mild, Very Firm, Milky\n3. Gouda = Soft, Sharp, level of sharpness increases the more you chew it, has a very pronounced \"kick\" at the end of the chewing experience\n4. Monterey Jack = Soft, Mild, Milky\n\nThoughts: It was very difficult to distinguish the difference between Gouda and Cheddar. I had to really look out for the \"kick\" at the end which the Gouda had but the Cheddar didn't. Even with this knowledge, I could still get this wrong because the level of strength and sharpness of the two cheeses were very close. It was also very difficult to distinguish between Swiss and Monterey Jack. Both cheeses were too mild and I found it impossible to tell them apart in terms of taste.\n\nSession 2: Traditional Danish Blue (Danablu) by Castello and Roquefort by Societe\n\nTastes and Texture:\n\n1. Danablu = Primary Notes of Creaminess and Milkyness, Still salty and sharp but these feel like they're in the \"background\". No pungent taste whatsoever. Crumbly texture, breaks apart in your mouth.\n2. Roquefort = Extremely Salty, Sharp, and Pungent. This cheese delivers these flavors at the highest level and all the flavours are right in your face. The pungent taste hits really hard and it lingers on your breath for ages.  Silky smooth and soft texture. Melts in your mouth rather than breaking apart.\n\nThoughts: These two cheeses were much easier to distinguish compared to Swiss and Monterey Jack as well as Cheddar and Gouda. It was very easy to pick out the pungent kick brought about by the Roquefort and the Danablu had none of that. It was also easy to distinguish how \"mild\" the Danablu tasted compared to the Roquefort.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jgwtbv/im_starting_to_get_interested_in_cheese_im_just/", "created_utc": 1742605764.0, "score": 3, "author": "joshuamarkrsantos", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jgwtbv/im_starting_to_get_interested_in_cheese_im_just/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cheese preservation in a shop", "selftext": "Hello, sorry for my bad English. I own a gourmet food store where we already sell cheeses. Currently, we have a counter-style refrigerator, like those used in butcher shops, and we package aged and semi-aged cheeses in vacuum-sealed plastic bags, while soft cheeses (Brie, Camembert, blue cheese, etc.) are sliced \u200b\u200band packaged in plastic wrap.\n\nI bought this kind of fridge a couple of years ago because it was what I could afford at the time, but we grew a lot and it ender up being too small for us, to the point where we can't get new exciting cheeses because we lack the place to display them properly.\n\nWe want to make changes in the display and storage of cheeses. For this purpose, we plan to purchase two large refrigerators of about 900lts each with glass doors, with temperature control but not humidity control. The refrigerators are similar to those used for beverages or dairy products in supermarkets and they go between 1 \u00b0C and 5\u00b0C. Our intention is to display the cheeses in both closed and cut wheels in these new refrigerators and also to store and display the pre-cut cheeses inside, wrapped in waxed paper on both sides (not specifically the cheese paper that is usually recommended; that type is not sold in our country, but it is similar). Blue, soft, and washed-rind cheeses would be placed uncovered on cooling racks with a tray underneath so they can breathe and the liquid they emanate would fall onto the tray so it could be removed and washed daily.\n\nI have some questions about this: \n\n\n-We will not have a way to control humidity, we\u2019ll be able to control the temperature, but humidity is something we can\u2019t manually regulate. Is there some sort of workaround for it, or would this be an obstacle at all?\n\n-Approximately, how long does a semi-hard or hard cheese last, cut and wrapped in the paper I mentioned and inside the fridge? We sell a lot of cheese so I'm not worried that it will go bad, however I don't want to end up selling a cheese that has dried up or had some sort of problem.\n\n-Is it risky, both in terms of flavor and contamination, to have blue and soft cheeses exposed unwrapped? Should I put them in a separate refrigerator? I can purchase a smaller one for this purpose\n\n-Will whole wheels keep aging inside the fridge? One of the reasons I want to make this change for is so that I can buy wheels in larger quantities and age them for longer myself, so I will be able for example to offer to my customers the same cheese 3 months aged, 5 months, 7 months and such.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jfea2g/cheese_preservation_in_a_shop/", "created_utc": 1742436212.0, "score": 9, "author": "t4nocolu", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jfea2g/cheese_preservation_in_a_shop/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Todays afternoon spread- Super Sharp Powerhouses", "selftext": "The plating isn\u2019t very fancy, but today\u2019s cheeses make up for it in sharpness! Going clockwise from the knife: \n\nIrish Cheddar blended with Whiskey- Wow! Immediately hits you with the whiskey, and the rest of your mouth reacts to it instantly. The kind of way your mouth tenses up and wants to tap against your pallets to really appreciate the almost fruity wave of alcohol. The sharp creaminess of the Irish cheddar instantly balances the entire bite, and keeps the whiskey from being the only flavor. This cheddar is quite delicious, but the star of the show to me here is the whiskey. It also lingers on the pallets for awhile, so I conclude that this cheese should have been the last on my list today, haha!\n\nParmigiano Reggiano - Classic parm! I feel like this kind of cheese really needs a good coating of saliva for its best notes to shine. My favorite way of eating it is to crumble it in my mouth into little granules with my tongue until all the cheese crumbs coat my mouth. That way, I can really appreciate all those nutty and tangy notes all around. Also, it seems that the hardness and powerful flavor of the parm helped rinse my pallete from the Irish Whiskey Cheddar from before, almost like a mouth exfoliant. A delicious, delicious\u2026 cheese toothpaste? ( \u2026no I don\u2019t think that one landed.)\n\nSartori Espresso BellaVitano Cheese - The up and coming star of the supermarket cheese world. Where I\u2019m from, no charcuterie board is complete without this beloved espresso cheese, and for good reason! The espresso aroma hits you before anything else, and you\u2019re immediately transported to wherever it is you get your coffee. For me, it triggered the smell of a coffee shop that also serves food, like a Starbucks or cozy cafe. Unlike the Irish Cheddar Whiskey, where the artisanal whiskey was the clear star of the product, the espresso cheese\u2019s actual cheese is completely different. The espresso elevates the cheeses natural tanginess and nutty flavors. Texture wise, this cheese has a very even distribution of crunchy flavor crystals, and aren\u2019t concentrated in little individual spots like the aged Gouda. The crystals really complement the cheese so well! This one feels like the perfect cafe experience, and is one of my favorites at the moment.\n\nBoars head aged Gouda from Holland - I forget how long it said on the package, but the hardness and amount of lactic crystal spots tell me it was a nice and long time. I call nice and hard goudas like this \u201cjawbreaker cheese\u201d. Not because they\u2019re too hard to eat, but because I love to let them sit in my mouth and suck on it until it almost disappears! It\u2019s a lot of fun to \u201cchisel\u201d away at it and for little crumbs to break off and sprinkle across my tongue. It\u2019s like a delicious, nutty, cheesy, salt lick. I stand by this. It\u2019s an incredibly savory hard cheese that can extend your cheese-tasting experience, or elevate it all at once in one big, crunchy explosion! \n\nCanadian 1000 Day Aged Cheddar- oh\u2026. That\u2019s the stuff. This Canadian Cheddar is as smooth as / butter /. It crumbles in small amounts but will slice smoothly in larger sizes, but melts like butter in your mouth. Everywhere a chip lands it\u2019s like it coats that spot of my mouth with a creamy patch of yumminess. Like the Sartori Espresso, this cheese also has an even distribution of small lactic flavor crystals. This cheese really wakes up the sides and underside of my tongue like an army drill Sargent with a trumpet. In a good way. WOW. This stuff is incredibly sharp and tangy, with a strong milky taste that rises to the top of the mouth / back of throat area as well. It\u2019s quite addictive, and I can easily imagine it as a powerful cheese base for melted cheese dishes like nachos, pastas, and especially Mac and cheese. Can\u2019t go wrong here if you like a sharp cheddar! \n\nOverall, these cheeses are all very delicious\u2026. I think my least favorite was the Parm (just because I\u2019m quite used to it by now) and the Irish Whiskey Cheddar. \u201cLeast\u201d favorite almost feels like they\u2019re not good cheeses, but they\u2019re still absolutely scrumdiddlyuptious! My favorite cheese this round has to be the Sartori Espresso BellaVitano. It has the perfect texture and balance of tasty crystals and a cheese powerful enough to pair perfectly with its Italian espresso coated rind. In my opinion, this cheese works great with anything that pairs well with coffee, but stands alone as its own snack as well. It\u2019s just so good. Unless you dislike coffee, in which case I\u2019d go for the Canadian Cheddar next. \n\n\nMy drink of choice while enjoying these cheeses: Iced Da Hong Pao Oolong Tea! \nIts powerful and fruity flavor is perfect for going up to bat against such sharp cheeses! This tea is light and floral with a woody raspberry aroma and flavor. This delicious tea served as a perfect pallet cleanser between cheese tasting. It\u2019s just as delicious when hot, but since I\u2019m enjoying it outside in Florida, iced tea ended up winning out. \n\nLet me know if you liked my review!

{"title": "Asking recommendation for Australian cheese", "selftext": "Hello, I'm travelling to Australia in May and would absolutely love some recommendations on some of those excellent cheese in Australia.\n\nWe're entering from Melbourne, going north until we reach lake Tyrrell (Maybe Mildura if there's something cool there), and head west toward Adelaide before returning to Melbourne along the coast line. My wife and I are looking forward to trying out different sorts of cheese throughout our journey, and we'd love some recommendations from other cheese lovers both in Australia and around the world.\n\nHere are our preferences:  \nBlue has always been our favorite. We especially enjoy Roquefort for the crystals along with the tangy and salty taste. We like it over the Gorgonzola, anyway. As for Stilton, I've never bought one for myself, but I think I've tried one before and from what I remember, the crumbly texture and the salty taste is quite enjoyable. \n\nI've used cheddar in my previous recipes. They were from Snowdonia Cheese company and they were quite nice. The ones that I was able to grab were aged for 2 years, and I haven't had any other kinds of cheddar except those from Costco.\n\n  \nOther enjoyable cheese I had were Prosecco, Mimolette, and a cheese that has bee wax for rind (couldn't remember the name) and is on the lighter side when it comes to taste. \n\n  \nI was never able to appreciate brie, and sweet cheeses fail to hit me. Overall, we seem to enjoy crumbly cheese with more intense flavor, and would love some recommendations about what I can try in Australia, preferably local to where we're travelling so the next time we travel in different regions of Australia, we can try out something new. As for wine, my wife and I can only accept sweet white wines, so if there are anything sweet that goes well with the cheese, please let us know. (when we say sweet, we mean ice wine level sweetness)  \n  \nWe might be bringing some of them back to Taiwan, and would really appreciate if you could recommend some cheese that is easily portable and easier to store.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1j2degg/asking_recommendation_for_australian_cheese/", "created_utc": 1740987363.0, "score": 7, "author": "nettleoak", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1j2degg/asking_recommendation_for_australian_cheese/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019ve been fortunate that some more well off friends have treated me to cheese or taken me to some cool places with samples. But I want to start picking and trying cheeses more often. The things I want to come to understand are: what cheeses should I start with?, is my cheese budget reasonable?, what \u2018pairings\u2019 I should try with cheeses I\u2019ve either already had or may like? I can drink alcohol but cannot eat nuts. Seeds are good, peanuts are good, meats are good, grains are good. \n\nHere are the main things I can say about my cheese interests and budget.\n\n1) I like primarily \u2018soft\u2019 cheeses I believe. Mozz over Parm for example. As well as sweet or spicy over sour.\n1.2) I like goat cheeses (I\u2019ve had a white cheddar I loved and many herbed or plain that I found amazing). \n1.3) had a sheep\u2019s cheese once, didn\u2019t catch the name which makes me so sad because I found it delicious. Would love to try more of these.\n1.4) I like spicy cheeses though I don\u2019t come across them very often. \n1.5) I like bleu cheese but I\u2019ve started to suspect I may have a minor allergy if I eat too much of it.\n\n2) I did the numbers I think I can justify $20 on cheese a month. It\u2019s still food, I can try it with many things, and ones I don\u2019t like I can share with friends ideally. I think this is low for a cheese budget but I just have to be honest about expenses.\n\n2.1) I am bordering Wisconsin as well and am willing to travel (3 hr> drive) for cheese maybe once a season. \n\n\nNot sure if that\u2019s enough info or possibly too much but I\u2019m excited to start exploring this community and hobby!

{"title": "Help! Trying to Find the Dutch Cheese from My Childhood.", "selftext": "EDIT / UPDATE #2: I got my hands on the Butterk\u00e4se cheese from Fred Meyer (grocery store chain in my area). The bad news? It\u2019s not the cheese I\u2019ve been looking for, sadly. Or, at least, the specific VARIETY of Butterk\u00e4se cheese that they had there wasn\u2019t the cheese I\u2019m looking for, from my childhood. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the one I\u2019m seeking ISN\u2019T Butterk\u00e4se, but it\u2019s definitely not THIS Butterk\u00e4se variety for sure. The good news? Even though this isn\u2019t the one I\u2019m looking for, this sh!t is DELICIOUS!!! Holy crapoly! \n\nSo I\u2019m still on the hunt, I won\u2019t stop looking for my \u201cperfect\u201d cheese - the one from my childhood in Israel - but I\u2019m so glad I found another super delicious one to add to my roster of feel-good, yummy, make-your-tummy-happy cheeses! And the best part? This one - the Butterk\u00e4se one from Fred Meyer - DOESN\u2019T aggravate my IBS!!!! If you have IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), then you\u2019ll know how rare it is to find cheese that doesn\u2019t destroy your stomach and make you pay a very hefty price for eating it. But this one is one of few that my stomach agrees with. Yay!!!!! \n\nSo if you have any other suggestions for the type of cheese I may be  looking for, please let me know! I\u2019m still looking! \n\n- D.\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\nEDIT / UPDATE #1: THANK YOU to everyone who has commented on my post with your recommendations, I TRULY appreciate it! The fact that even one person, let alone this many of you, took the time out of your day to help me out is so kind and so generous, I really, REALLY appreciate your kindness. I\u2019ve been trying to solve this mystery for ages now! The good news is that I THINK one of you good people MAY have solved this mystery! Someone commented and suggested that it might be \u201c*BUTTERK\u00c4SE*\u201d cheese, which isn\u2019t Dutch but is actually German. I looked it up, and it seems like there ARE varieties of Butterk\u00e4se cheese that are totally smooth and hole-less, which would mean the texture is a match, and there ARE varieties of it that are a super-pale, practically white color, which would make the color a 100% a match, too! So THIS MIGHT BE IT!!!!! I am going to try to find a local Butterk\u00e4se cheese near me that matches that description and if there\u2019s one available within a 2-hours\u2019 drive of me, then I\u2019m going to buy it immediately and taste-test it. I\u2019ll update this post once I\u2019ve tasted it, and hopefully it will be to confirm that this is indeed it. Wish me luck! \n\n\nQuick(ish) Side Note:\n\nIf Butterk\u00e4se is indeed my beloved childhood cheese that I was completely obsessed with when I lived in Israel in the 90s, then the irony is not lost on me, lol. I mean, the fact that I, a JEWISH person, have been relentlessly HUNTING DOWN and dreaming of reuniting with my beloved childhood cheese and it may have been GERMAN all along, AND if it was really Butterk\u00e4se, then it was invented in 1928, a mere 11 years before WWII began in Germany\u2026 Now if that\u2019s not ironic, I simply don\u2019t know what is. The funniest thing is that one of my best friends IS German - as in, actually born and raised (until the age of 10, anyway) in Germany, and she and her entire family know that I\u2019ve been seeking this mysterious cheese for YEARS. So THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHICH CHEESE I\u2019VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ALL THIS TIME! My god, betrayed by the Germans again! But then, this would ALSO mean that they had invented the very food that had brought me the most joy as a child\u2026 My heart and spirit are so conflicted! And you know which people probably have a strangely specific, perfect word for how I\u2019m feeling? Probably the Germans. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude44\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\nThis is my first ever post on Reddit, so sorry if this isn\u2019t structured properly or sounds dumb, but I need some help: I\u2019ve been trying - for over 2 DECADES - to find my favorite cheese from my childhood, and l\u2019ve been getting nowhere with this search on my own. I\u2019m hoping someone here might be able to help. \n\nThis was a Dutch cheese that my mom used to buy for me when we lived in Israel in the late 90s, and she bought this cheese from the local, nearby deli, where they sliced it there for her, on the spot, from the large block of that cheese. So when she brought it home, it didn\u2019t come in any sort of official packaging, it was just in that typical white deli wrapping paper, inside a clear plastic bag. So no brand name or cheese name, no label, no logo, nothing. Here is what I can remember about it, as best as I can describe it: \n\n- It was a DUTCH cheese - my mom just kept calling it \u201cgalandskiy sir,\u201d which is Russian for \u201cHolland cheese.\u201d Not super specific, clearly.\n\n- COLOR: It was VERY, VERY LIGHT in color, practically white. When sliced (I had only ever seen it in sliced form, ready for sandwich-making), there was the FAINTEST\u2026smudge? Watercolor-effect-type of aura/smudge? Not sure how to describe it\u2026of the FAINTEST HINT of baby pink, or sometimes baby blue, kind of across the center of it? It might have been transferred over from some kind of wrapping though? Like, before it was sliced at the deli. OR, maybe that\u2019s just how the cheese literally looked on the inside, throughout the entire block of cheese, I don\u2019t know. \n\n- SHAPE: [In sliced form] The slices were large, rectangular, but with very rounded corners. There was no rind. The slices were pretty thin, but maintained their shape, so this was a medium-soft cheese - NOT hard and NOT so soft as to be brie-like. Shape-wise, it was a cross between Provolone and Monterey Jack cheese. \n\n- TEXTURE: [In sliced form] The slices were totally smooth - no holes or dips anywhere. Again, in texture, it was very similar to Monterey Jack and Provolone cheeses, but maybe a SMIDGE firmer? \n\n- TASTE/FLAVOR: It had a very mild and slightly salty taste. Not sour at all, not sweet at all. Not tart. Just cheesy and lightly salty. (Though I LOVE salt and have a very high tolerance for salt and salty things, so it may have tasted TO ME as \u201clightly salty\u201d but to others, maybe it was quite salty? Dunno). \n\nWhen I described it to ChatGPT, in trying to come up with a more\u2026digestible  [pun intended, lol]\u2026 description of it, this is what it came up with: \n\n\u201cYoung, lightly aged, traditional Dutch cheese sold in Israeli delis in late 90s. Very pale, almost white in color. Smooth-textured, semi-soft cheese. It was a mild, slightly salty, semi-soft Dutch-style cheese in the form of bulk wheel or block of cheese that they cut to order.\u201d \n\nDoes ANYONE know what cheese this is, and if you do, is it at all possible to get it in the United States? \n\n(Sorry for being overly verbose, I can\u2019t help it. This is as concise as I could make this, I swear).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1iss1e0/help_trying_to_find_the_dutch_cheese_from_my/", "created_utc": 1739925029.0, "score": 12, "author": "Powerful-Cookie-9002", "num_comments": 49, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1iss1e0/help_trying_to_find_the_dutch_cheese_from_my/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Both my lower digestive tract and my house sewer system dislike me very much.\nSo, how\u2019s the cheese? It is excellent! I got it vacuum packed in eight wedges since I was worried I\u2019d have it go bad before six months were out. Well\u2026 I\u2019ve eaten two entire wedges so far, and just ate a couple slices off the third tonight. There is not enough Metamucil in the country to alleviate the side effects of this gluttony.\n\nHere\u2019s something odd: all the Beemster Classic I\u2019ve gotten here in its incredibly little $23/pound pieces have that wonderful, salty crunch to it from the protein crystals. This wheel simply does not. I might get one or two per wedge. Plus, the cheese itself tastes very much like an extra-sharp cheddar rather than Beemster. It definitely is aged, since the rind on the outside is probably 1/2\u201d (12mm :) ) thick and tastes like super old Beemster. \nAll labelling was intact on the slices, including the Beemster Classic name around the edge and on the face, and there were noticeable \u201cauthenticity marks\u201d on some of the cheese: 2D barcodes inked or burned into the rind underneath the wax outer layer.\n\nSo\u2026 I don\u2019t know why the difference in taste and texture.

Brie should taste rich, creamy, and buttery while Camembert and Taleggio should taste rich, earthy, and have very strong mushroom tasting notes.

{"title": "Roquefort (Societe) vs Cabrales. Battle of the Heavyweights. Thoughts?", "selftext": "I tried Cabrales for the first time a while ago. I finished 100g of it and I really got to taste it inside and out. The Cabrales was incredible. It was amazing and I'm glad I tasted it.\n\nOn the other hand, Roquefort (Societe) is by far my favorite cheese out there. I eat 100g of it on a weekly basis and I know its' taste by heart.\n\nHere are my thoughts on the two cheeses. I'd love to hear what you guys think if you've ever tried these cheeses. FYI, these are two of the strongest cheeses I've tried so far. Regardless of brand, any Roquefort or Cabrales will stink up an entire room and knock your socks off when you eat it.\n\nOverall Strength of Flavor: Roquefort wins this. Just barely. Both cheeses have the same level of sharpness and pungent flavor. The difference lies in each cheese having an additional tasting note. Roquefort is salty while the Cabrales has a bit of a spicy kick to it. However, the saltiness of the Roquefort far exceeds the spiciness of the Cabrales. The Cabrales has a spicy tasting note, but not on the same level such as a Gorgonzola (Piccante) or even a Provolone (Piccante). Since saltiness is a major factor in what makes a cheese taste strong, the sheer saltiness of the cheese carries the Roquefort past the Cabrales in terms of overall strength of flavor.\n\nComplexity of Flavor: Cabrales wins this and it's not even close. The Roquefort can be described mainly as pungent, salty, and sharp. However, the Cabrales can be described as pungent, sharp, slightly spicy, bitter, and acidic. There's simply more going on in a Cabrales in terms of tasting notes. You're getting a lot more complex flavors.\n\nWhich do I like more?: Roquefort is still my favorite. When I eat a blue cheese, I'm going for pure strength of flavor rather than complexity. I want a cheese that punches me hard in the mouth. Roquefort has a slightly more powerful punch. In addition to this, I'm personally a sucker for cheeses with salty tasting notes. I love Feta, Aged Cheddar, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Pecorino Romano. Then again, comparing these two cheeses is like asking the question \"Who would you rather be punched by? Prime Mike Tyson or Deontay Wilder?\"\n\nConclusion: None of these cheeses are weak. It doesn't matter what brand of Cabrales or Roquefort you choose. You're in for the wildest of rides with any of these cheeses.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jurc8r/roquefort_societe_vs_cabrales_battle_of_the/", "created_utc": 1744153712.0, "score": 12, "author": "joshuamarkrsantos", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jurc8r/roquefort_societe_vs_cabrales_battle_of_the/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I know y'all are sick of hearing about Cougar Gold... But humor me", "selftext": "Okay y'all, I know we're all cheese lovers.\n\nAnd I know y'all are sick of hearing about Cougar Gold.\n\nBut I also see so much misinformation about it that I want to set the record straight. Here are a few things to know about Cougar Gold coming from a student at WSU studying cheese/dairy science. I do not work for the WSU Creamery.\n\n1. Cougar Gold is an aged white cheddar and meets the standards of NATURAL CHEESE (it is not cheese food or processed cheese!). The production process is very similar to every other cheddar production process: the pasteurization of the milk coming from our dairy, the starter culture acidification, the rennet coagulation, curd cooking, draining, cheddaring, etc. The curd is then pressed into the nearly 2 lb wheel overnight, then placed into sterile cans to be sealed. (u/meerkat-fusion elaborated in one of the comments on this!)\n2. Every can of Cougar Gold is aged for at least one year in order for the flavor to develop. There have been modifications over the years to hone in on this flavor, and many studies have been done or are currently being done to better understand this. Yes, cheddars are usually aged with exposure to air, but this storage technique is unique to Cougar Gold and does not cause problems with the sensory perception of the product.\n3. The creamery here is incredibly busy, as they not only make one variety but up to 10 varieties in a year. They also produce ice cream, though that is only sold at the storefront. Production happens during the 5 work days of the week, year-round, and even with that, the Cougar Gold supply is tight.\n4. Cougar Gold can be aged for years with proper refrigeration, as I've seen cans that have held for 10 years and been beautiful once opened. That being said, over time it will become more crumbly, harder in texture, and the distinct cheddar flavors will increase along with the crystal production.\n5. The main defect seen with Cougar Gold is a common one with many cheddars in the past 10+ years: Gas blowing. This happens when cheese is contaminated with a bacteria like *P. wasatchensis*, which is not harmful with consumption but has a nasty habit of producing CO2. This is characterized by a puffy can, and at that point, the cheese is beyond saving. **The creamery will exchange your can though if it does happen!!**\n\nAll this being said, Cougar Gold is a very interesting cheese that was incredibly innovative for the time it was first developed, with a rich history that continues today at WSU. It's great as a snacking cheese, and it's also great when added to say Mac n' Cheese, grilled cheese, or other dishes. If you are international, I do absolutely understand not shelling out the money to get it delivered, because it is just another sharp, aged white cheddar. That being said, if you ever get the chance, at least give it a try\u2764\ufe0f\n\nIf y'all have any questions, please feel free to ask!! I understand that it's a divisive cheese here (this will be the only time I post anything about it), but I love to share the knowledge I've gathered. Go Cougs and have a great week!\n\nEdit: Thanks for my first award\ud83e\udd79\u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jtvi3c/i_know_yall_are_sick_of_hearing_about_cougar_gold/", "created_utc": 1744057898.0, "score": 194, "author": "Kant_Think", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jtvi3c/i_know_yall_are_sick_of_hearing_about_cougar_gold/", "html_title": ""}

Those cheeses will knock your socks off in terms of flavor and 28g would be a reasonable amount to identify all the tasting notes. The flavours of these cheeses are also extremely strong and a small 28g serving would last quite a while because you can only eat a tiny amount of cheese per bite.

{"title": "I'm starting to get interested in Cheese. I'm just tasting different types of cheeses at my own pace and trying to learn the different flavors. Would you mind giving me feedback and correcting my taste findings?", "selftext": "I've done two tasting sessions in my own house.I bought cheese and compared them in order to try to be able to distinguish different types of cheeses. My goals are to be able to learn how different cheeses taste and to be able to distinguish one cheese from another. Here are my thoughts from my two tasting sessions. I'm still new to this and I probably made wrong judgments in terms of taste. I would love some feedback from people who are more experienced in tasting cheese. \n\nSession 1:  Bergeron Lactose-Free Cheese pack containing Cheddar, Swiss, Gouda, and Monterey Jack\n\nTastes and Texture:\n\n1. Cheddar = Firm, Decent Level of Sharpness, same level of sharpness throughout the chewing experience\n2. Swiss = Mild, Very Firm, Milky\n3. Gouda = Soft, Sharp, level of sharpness increases the more you chew it, has a very pronounced \"kick\" at the end of the chewing experience\n4. Monterey Jack = Soft, Mild, Milky\n\nThoughts: It was very difficult to distinguish the difference between Gouda and Cheddar. I had to really look out for the \"kick\" at the end which the Gouda had but the Cheddar didn't. Even with this knowledge, I could still get this wrong because the level of strength and sharpness of the two cheeses were very close. It was also very difficult to distinguish between Swiss and Monterey Jack. Both cheeses were too mild and I found it impossible to tell them apart in terms of taste.\n\nSession 2: Traditional Danish Blue (Danablu) by Castello and Roquefort by Societe\n\nTastes and Texture:\n\n1. Danablu = Primary Notes of Creaminess and Milkyness, Still salty and sharp but these feel like they're in the \"background\". No pungent taste whatsoever. Crumbly texture, breaks apart in your mouth.\n2. Roquefort = Extremely Salty, Sharp, and Pungent. This cheese delivers these flavors at the highest level and all the flavours are right in your face. The pungent taste hits really hard and it lingers on your breath for ages.  Silky smooth and soft texture. Melts in your mouth rather than breaking apart.\n\nThoughts: These two cheeses were much easier to distinguish compared to Swiss and Monterey Jack as well as Cheddar and Gouda. It was very easy to pick out the pungent kick brought about by the Roquefort and the Danablu had none of that. It was also easy to distinguish how \"mild\" the Danablu tasted compared to the Roquefort.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jgwtbv/im_starting_to_get_interested_in_cheese_im_just/", "created_utc": 1742605764.0, "score": 5, "author": "joshuamarkrsantos", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jgwtbv/im_starting_to_get_interested_in_cheese_im_just/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Cheese preservation in a shop", "selftext": "Hello, sorry for my bad English. I own a gourmet food store where we already sell cheeses. Currently, we have a counter-style refrigerator, like those used in butcher shops, and we package aged and semi-aged cheeses in vacuum-sealed plastic bags, while soft cheeses (Brie, Camembert, blue cheese, etc.) are sliced \u200b\u200band packaged in plastic wrap.\n\nI bought this kind of fridge a couple of years ago because it was what I could afford at the time, but we grew a lot and it ender up being too small for us, to the point where we can't get new exciting cheeses because we lack the place to display them properly.\n\nWe want to make changes in the display and storage of cheeses. For this purpose, we plan to purchase two large refrigerators of about 900lts each with glass doors, with temperature control but not humidity control. The refrigerators are similar to those used for beverages or dairy products in supermarkets and they go between 1 \u00b0C and 5\u00b0C. Our intention is to display the cheeses in both closed and cut wheels in these new refrigerators and also to store and display the pre-cut cheeses inside, wrapped in waxed paper on both sides (not specifically the cheese paper that is usually recommended; that type is not sold in our country, but it is similar). Blue, soft, and washed-rind cheeses would be placed uncovered on cooling racks with a tray underneath so they can breathe and the liquid they emanate would fall onto the tray so it could be removed and washed daily.\n\nI have some questions about this: \n\n\n-We will not have a way to control humidity, we\u2019ll be able to control the temperature, but humidity is something we can\u2019t manually regulate. Is there some sort of workaround for it, or would this be an obstacle at all?\n\n-Approximately, how long does a semi-hard or hard cheese last, cut and wrapped in the paper I mentioned and inside the fridge? We sell a lot of cheese so I'm not worried that it will go bad, however I don't want to end up selling a cheese that has dried up or had some sort of problem.\n\n-Is it risky, both in terms of flavor and contamination, to have blue and soft cheeses exposed unwrapped? Should I put them in a separate refrigerator? I can purchase a smaller one for this purpose\n\n-Will whole wheels keep aging inside the fridge? One of the reasons I want to make this change for is so that I can buy wheels in larger quantities and age them for longer myself, so I will be able for example to offer to my customers the same cheese 3 months aged, 5 months, 7 months and such.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1jfea2g/cheese_preservation_in_a_shop/", "created_utc": 1742436212.0, "score": 8, "author": "t4nocolu", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1jfea2g/cheese_preservation_in_a_shop/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Todays afternoon spread- Super Sharp Powerhouses", "selftext": "The plating isn\u2019t very fancy, but today\u2019s cheeses make up for it in sharpness! Going clockwise from the knife: \n\nIrish Cheddar blended with Whiskey- Wow! Immediately hits you with the whiskey, and the rest of your mouth reacts to it instantly. The kind of way your mouth tenses up and wants to tap against your pallets to really appreciate the almost fruity wave of alcohol. The sharp creaminess of the Irish cheddar instantly balances the entire bite, and keeps the whiskey from being the only flavor. This cheddar is quite delicious, but the star of the show to me here is the whiskey. It also lingers on the pallets for awhile, so I conclude that this cheese should have been the last on my list today, haha!\n\nParmigiano Reggiano - Classic parm! I feel like this kind of cheese really needs a good coating of saliva for its best notes to shine. My favorite way of eating it is to crumble it in my mouth into little granules with my tongue until all the cheese crumbs coat my mouth. That way, I can really appreciate all those nutty and tangy notes all around. Also, it seems that the hardness and powerful flavor of the parm helped rinse my pallete from the Irish Whiskey Cheddar from before, almost like a mouth exfoliant. A delicious, delicious\u2026 cheese toothpaste? ( \u2026no I don\u2019t think that one landed.)\n\nSartori Espresso BellaVitano Cheese - The up and coming star of the supermarket cheese world. Where I\u2019m from, no charcuterie board is complete without this beloved espresso cheese, and for good reason! The espresso aroma hits you before anything else, and you\u2019re immediately transported to wherever it is you get your coffee. For me, it triggered the smell of a coffee shop that also serves food, like a Starbucks or cozy cafe. Unlike the Irish Cheddar Whiskey, where the artisanal whiskey was the clear star of the product, the espresso cheese\u2019s actual cheese is completely different. The espresso elevates the cheeses natural tanginess and nutty flavors. Texture wise, this cheese has a very even distribution of crunchy flavor crystals, and aren\u2019t concentrated in little individual spots like the aged Gouda. The crystals really complement the cheese so well! This one feels like the perfect cafe experience, and is one of my favorites at the moment.\n\nBoars head aged Gouda from Holland - I forget how long it said on the package, but the hardness and amount of lactic crystal spots tell me it was a nice and long time. I call nice and hard goudas like this \u201cjawbreaker cheese\u201d. Not because they\u2019re too hard to eat, but because I love to let them sit in my mouth and suck on it until it almost disappears! It\u2019s a lot of fun to \u201cchisel\u201d away at it and for little crumbs to break off and sprinkle across my tongue. It\u2019s like a delicious, nutty, cheesy, salt lick. I stand by this. It\u2019s an incredibly savory hard cheese that can extend your cheese-tasting experience, or elevate it all at once in one big, crunchy explosion! \n\nCanadian 1000 Day Aged Cheddar- oh\u2026. That\u2019s the stuff. This Canadian Cheddar is as smooth as / butter /. It crumbles in small amounts but will slice smoothly in larger sizes, but melts like butter in your mouth. Everywhere a chip lands it\u2019s like it coats that spot of my mouth with a creamy patch of yumminess. Like the Sartori Espresso, this cheese also has an even distribution of small lactic flavor crystals. This cheese really wakes up the sides and underside of my tongue like an army drill Sargent with a trumpet. In a good way. WOW. This stuff is incredibly sharp and tangy, with a strong milky taste that rises to the top of the mouth / back of throat area as well. It\u2019s quite addictive, and I can easily imagine it as a powerful cheese base for melted cheese dishes like nachos, pastas, and especially Mac and cheese. Can\u2019t go wrong here if you like a sharp cheddar! \n\nOverall, these cheeses are all very delicious\u2026. I think my least favorite was the Parm (just because I\u2019m quite used to it by now) and the Irish Whiskey Cheddar. \u201cLeast\u201d favorite almost feels like they\u2019re not good cheeses, but they\u2019re still absolutely scrumdiddlyuptious! My favorite cheese this round has to be the Sartori Espresso BellaVitano. It has the perfect texture and balance of tasty crystals and a cheese powerful enough to pair perfectly with its Italian espresso coated rind. In my opinion, this cheese works great with anything that pairs well with coffee, but stands alone as its own snack as well. It\u2019s just so good. Unless you dislike coffee, in which case I\u2019d go for the Canadian Cheddar next. \n\n\nMy drink of choice while enjoying these cheeses: Iced Da Hong Pao Oolong Tea! \nIts powerful and fruity flavor is perfect for going up to bat against such sharp cheeses! This tea is light and floral with a woody raspberry aroma and flavor. This delicious tea served as a perfect pallet cleanser between cheese tasting. It\u2019s just as delicious when hot, but since I\u2019m enjoying it outside in Florida, iced tea ended up winning out. \n\nLet me know if you liked my review!

My wife and I are looking forward to trying out different sorts of cheese throughout our journey, and we'd love some recommendations from other cheese lovers both in Australia and around the world.\n\nHere are our preferences:  \nBlue has always been our favorite. We especially enjoy Roquefort for the crystals along with the tangy and salty taste. We like it over the Gorgonzola, anyway. As for Stilton, I've never bought one for myself, but I think I've tried one before and from what I remember, the crumbly texture and the salty taste is quite enjoyable. \n\nI've used cheddar in my previous recipes. They were from Snowdonia Cheese company and they were quite nice. The ones that I was able to grab were aged for 2 years, and I haven't had any other kinds of cheddar except those from Costco.\n\n  \nOther enjoyable cheese I had were Prosecco, Mimolette, and a cheese that has bee wax for rind (couldn't remember the name) and is on the lighter side when it comes to taste. \n\n  \nI was never able to appreciate brie, and sweet cheeses fail to hit me. Overall, we seem to enjoy crumbly cheese with more intense flavor, and would love some recommendations about what I can try in Australia, preferably local to where we're travelling so the next time we travel in different regions of Australia, we can try out something new. As for wine, my wife and I can only accept sweet white wines, so if there are anything sweet that goes well with the cheese, please let us know. (when we say sweet, we mean ice wine level sweetness)  \n  \nWe might be bringing some of them back to Taiwan, and would really appreciate if you could recommend some cheese that is easily portable and easier to store.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/comments/1j2degg/asking_recommendation_for_australian_cheese/", "created_utc": 1740987363.0, "score": 6, "author": "nettleoak", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Cheese/comments/1j2degg/asking_recommendation_for_australian_cheese/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Help me get cheese data", "selftext": "years ago, I was eating a cheese that I don't normally eat and I thought to myself \"this is a good cheese, this is an above average cheese.. why don't I eat this cheese more often.\" Then I thought, \"well (pretty much) all types of cheese are good cheese and if all cheese is 'above average' then what is the average rating of cheese\" \n\nI've asked friends, family, tinder matches this question, and have been met with mixed results: some argue that there is more criteria to rating cheese than just 'is it good?' such as versatility, or will perhaps say one cheese that they think is \"best\" but not dive deeper into the debate or analysis.\n\nUntil recently, I thought my cheese analysis would never be completed, but then my company started hosting these meetings where for fifteen minutes an employee could present on any non-work-related topic of their choice. It was a golden opportunity.. I'd create a cheese survey and have my team submit their ratings.\n\nOnce the initial ratings were established, I could get information such as the average rating, the standard deviation and distribution of the data, as well as other information, like what cheeses are most polarizing and have the widest distribution of ratings.\n\nFollowing the ratings, my plan is to pin the cheeses against one another, in a march madness bracket of sorts, with each round being a single elimination match where the two cheeses are pinned against each other and evaluated on one criteria (which cheese is more versatile? which would be your desert island cheese? etc).\n\nAfter the success of sharing the initial survey with my team, I've been inspired to open the survey to as many people as possible.  The bigger the data set, the better.\n\nhoping some fellow cheese lovers would want to rate some cheeses for the initial ratings round:  https://forms.gle/YgCkjF2PhjYfvBsT8\n\nthanks so much!
