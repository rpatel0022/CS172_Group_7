{"title": "My Clausen pickle recipe", "selftext": "I have been working on this for a few years and have gotten to a point where I consider it done. I have seen Clausen pickles come up a few times in the last few weeks so I though I would share my copycat recipe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n1. Clausen pickles have a pH of 6.8 - 7.0 according to my cheap pH meter. This means there is very little vinegar.\n2. They are not processed at using heat, which is why they need to be stored in the refrigerator (also because of their high pH).\n3. I do not believe they use apple cider vinegar as many recipes claim, it is white vinegar but seeing as though there is very little to begin with you could probably use either and not notice a difference.\n4. The ingredients were determined from the ingredients label and a scan of the solids in a jar after straining it out.\n5. I do not know the variety of cucumber they use, but Kirby's are close if you pick them early. Kirby's picked later will have thicker skin that isn't the same as Clausen.\n6. They store well in the refrigerator for up to 6 months, possibly longer but I wouldn't trust them to be shelf stable due to the pH being too high. At 6 months they are still hella crispy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese quantities are for a single quart canning jar and it scales linearly:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 cups water\n\n1/3rd cup white vinegar\n\n2 Tblsp salt\n\n2 Tsp sugar\n\n10 peppercorns\n\n1-2 large cloves of garlic. I like to finely dice it.\n\n1/2 Tsp red bell pepper, diced. (I just take a thin slice off a pepper).\n\n1 Tsp mustard seed\n\n1/4 Tsp Coriander\n\n1 Crushed Bay Leaf\n\n1/4 Tsp Turmeric\n\nA few sprigs of dill.\n\nAnd however many cucumber slices will fit into the jar\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Mix the water, vinegar, sugar and salt in a bowl (you do not heed to heat this, just stir until everything is dissolved).\n2. Add the peppercorns, garlic, red pepper, mustard seeds, coriander, bay leaf, turmeric, dill and cucumbers to the jar.\n3. Pour the liquid into the jar and leave a bit of headspace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as for processing I have done this a few different ways. Boiling water will fuck it up no matter how little time you go for, they end up mushy. Pressure canning, same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe they are minimally heat processed as doing these straight into the refrigerator isn't the same, they end up too crunchy and do not absorb the salt and other flavors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I have settled on is using an immersion circulator process them for 3 hours at 140F. They will stay crispy in the refrigerator for at least 6 months, maybe longer but I have not stored them longer than 6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere you go, enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit (10/27/2023): Since I have posted this 4 years ago I have eaten over a hundred of these jars, half of which were over 6 months in the fridge. After 9 months they lose some of the crispiness but not a single jar has spoiled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have also changed the processing temperature from 140F to 130F in order to extend the crispiness past 9 months. So far this seems to have have been successful.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pickling/comments/cccdb9/my_clausen_pickle_recipe/", "created_utc": 1562945601.0, "score": 144, "author": "Kriegenstein", "num_comments": 72, "permalink": "/r/pickling/comments/cccdb9/my_clausen_pickle_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
