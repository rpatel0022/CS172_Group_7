This is amazing!\" -the cucumber went so well with the fruit. \n\nSo anyway, I should have added the fruit to the salad with the red wine vinegar and olive oil, and you could even add cheeses, a protein, or don't, it would be amazing either way. \n\nI could imagine if the fruit and vinegar and cucumber could be made into a homemade dressing, it would be so nice! \n\nI'm sure others have thought this up before, but the salad and fruit made me so happy.\n\nIn addition to this, you might can sneak tiny bits of cucumber into fruit mixes for kids that don't eat veggies, or even throw cucumber into fruit smoothies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/salads/comments/1i5of3d/i_want_to_share_a_fruity_salad_idea_that_i/", "created_utc": 1737373628.0, "score": 69, "author": "shadowsipp", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/salads/comments/1i5of3d/i_want_to_share_a_fruity_salad_idea_that_i/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Hmm... so what are your favorite 'salad hacks?' I'll start:", "selftext": "\"Salad hacks\" is not really an expression I thought I'd ever use, but here we go... oO\n\n- So here in the Midwest, oftentimes I'll be lazy and just buy a salad kit (about US$4), for example [Fresh Express](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22fresh+express%22+salad+kits&udm=2).  Now, they're ~okay~ on their own, but I almost always add in thinly-sliced red onion, a diced, ripe tomato, roasted garlic, and some ripe avocado wedges where possible.  All kind of a no-brainer, but we're gettin' there...\n\n- Toppings and add-ins are also grand, like black pepper, red pepper flakes, nuts & seeds, maybe some dried chives, a bit of curry powder, a sprinkle of powdered ginger, a wafting of dried basil... you get the idea.  Oh!  And most certainly some grated parm/romano, plus nutritional yeast. (does it have umami?  oh yes, it has [umami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami)!)\n\n- And here's where my real salad-hack starts: you know how those kits give you the smallest dressing packet ever?  And typically, you'll try your best to spread it all around on top, shake things a bit, and when you're eating, it'll STILL be either feast or famine, so to speak?  Well, I found a better way: (guess I'll do a fresh bullet point, sorry not sorry)\n\n- Okay, take that same salad kit and put it in a clean, round container of about 48FL OZ (fluid ounces).  It looks something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/jB7Pbfr.jpeg) (altho I have no idea why that pic has like three lids, cuz' you'll only need one).  So then, pour your salad and thinly-chopped onions in, then add in the dressing.  Now give it some good shakes in a SWIRLING motion, turn upside-down, and repeat.  Then do it one last time.  Now add in the rest of the ingredients and do the same.  Little crunchies like croutons and sesame crisps should should always be last, sprinkled on top, as always (so they remain their crispiest).  What you'll find I think is that the formerly 'little packet' of dressing almost *magically* coats everything, imparting its delicious flavor like a fever dream to every punkin' ingredient you put in there!  (of course if the dressing sucks, then this is downright horrible advice, lol)\n\n- Now, I got one last tip for you-- take whatever salad you have and put it in a tortilla wrap.  I personally like [these](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ole+mexican+foods%22+%22spinach+wrap%22&udm=2), cuz they're low-cal, I'm middle-aged, and I need to lose weight!  Use something to secure the ad-hoc burritos, like toothpicks or even binder-clips! (yes, you heard me correctly, but whatever works; that's the point)  Now put that in your air-fryer, brushed with a little peanut (or favorite) oil for a couple minutes.  Then take it out and add whatever you like (as above); perhaps some Caesar's dressing? (all up to YOU, of course)\n\nAnd now you're in *HEAVEN*.\n\n**So what have we learned here, today?** (which many of you probably already knew long ago, so I guess this post might disappoint some of you, sorry)\n\nI guess my little point here is that salad doesn't ***have*** to get boring.

I love a big breakfast, but I don\u2019t care much for sweet breakfast foods and like to frontload my day with as many vegetables as possible. Then the whole rest of the day I don\u2019t have to concern myself with whether I\u2019m getting enough vegetables in my diet. It also keeps me satisfied until about 3 or 3:30 when I need a light snack or some protein. It\u2019s also delightful to see a plate full of colorful ingredients. \n\nQ. Are you trying to lose weight? \nA. No, my weight is normal. My weight has been roughly the same since I was in my teens. \n\nQ. How long does it take to make that salad?\nA. If I\u2019m not concerned with taking a photo, about 15-20 minutes, but I can work quickly with a sharp knife. I keep my knife extremely sharp and hone it often. I have a mandoline I use sometimes, but I hate cleaning that thing. Certain things I prepare ahead of time, like quinoa, boiled eggs, and my lemon vinaigrette.

This is amazing!\" -the cucumber went so well with the fruit. \n\nSo anyway, I should have added the fruit to the salad with the red wine vinegar and olive oil, and you could even add cheeses, a protein, or don't, it would be amazing either way. \n\nI could imagine if the fruit and vinegar and cucumber could be made into a homemade dressing, it would be so nice! \n\nI'm sure others have thought this up before, but the salad and fruit made me so happy.\n\nIn addition to this, you might can sneak tiny bits of cucumber into fruit mixes for kids that don't eat veggies, or even throw cucumber into fruit smoothies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/salads/comments/1i5of3d/i_want_to_share_a_fruity_salad_idea_that_i/", "created_utc": 1737373628.0, "score": 71, "author": "shadowsipp", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/salads/comments/1i5of3d/i_want_to_share_a_fruity_salad_idea_that_i/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Hmm... so what are your favorite 'salad hacks?' I'll start:", "selftext": "\"Salad hacks\" is not really an expression I thought I'd ever use, but here we go... oO\n\n- So here in the Midwest, oftentimes I'll be lazy and just buy a salad kit (about US$4), for example [Fresh Express](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22fresh+express%22+salad+kits&udm=2).  Now, they're ~okay~ on their own, but I almost always add in thinly-sliced red onion, a diced, ripe tomato, roasted garlic, and some ripe avocado wedges where possible.  All kind of a no-brainer, but we're gettin' there...\n\n- Toppings and add-ins are also grand, like black pepper, red pepper flakes, nuts & seeds, maybe some dried chives, a bit of curry powder, a sprinkle of powdered ginger, a wafting of dried basil... you get the idea.  Oh!  And most certainly some grated parm/romano, plus nutritional yeast. (does it have umami?  oh yes, it has [umami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami)!)\n\n- And here's where my real salad-hack starts: you know how those kits give you the smallest dressing packet ever?  And typically, you'll try your best to spread it all around on top, shake things a bit, and when you're eating, it'll STILL be either feast or famine, so to speak?  Well, I found a better way: (guess I'll do a fresh bullet point, sorry not sorry)\n\n- Okay, take that same salad kit and put it in a clean, round container of about 48FL OZ (fluid ounces).  It looks something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/jB7Pbfr.jpeg) (altho I have no idea why that pic has like three lids, cuz' you'll only need one).  So then, pour your salad and thinly-chopped onions in, then add in the dressing.  Now give it some good shakes in a SWIRLING motion, turn upside-down, and repeat.  Then do it one last time.  Now add in the rest of the ingredients and do the same.  Little crunchies like croutons and sesame crisps should should always be last, sprinkled on top, as always (so they remain their crispiest).  What you'll find I think is that the formerly 'little packet' of dressing almost *magically* coats everything, imparting its delicious flavor like a fever dream to every punkin' ingredient you put in there!  (of course if the dressing sucks, then this is downright horrible advice, lol)\n\n- Now, I got one last tip for you-- take whatever salad you have and put it in a tortilla wrap.  I personally like [these](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ole+mexican+foods%22+%22spinach+wrap%22&udm=2), cuz they're low-cal, I'm middle-aged, and I need to lose weight!  Use something to secure the ad-hoc burritos, like toothpicks or even binder-clips! (yes, you heard me correctly, but whatever works; that's the point)  Now put that in your air-fryer, brushed with a little peanut (or favorite) oil for a couple minutes.  Then take it out and add whatever you like (as above); perhaps some Caesar's dressing? (all up to YOU, of course)\n\nAnd now you're in *HEAVEN*.\n\n**So what have we learned here, today?** (which many of you probably already knew long ago, so I guess this post might disappoint some of you, sorry)\n\nI guess my little point here is that salad doesn't ***have*** to get boring.  Especially as part of a healthy diet, right?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/salads/comments/1eowa6m/hmm_so_what_are_your_favorite_salad_hacks_ill/", "created_utc": 1723305176.0, "score": 75, "author": "JohnnyEnzyme", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/salads/comments/1eowa6m/hmm_so_what_are_your_favorite_salad_hacks_ill/", "html_title": ""}
