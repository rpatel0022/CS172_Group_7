{"title": "Visualize your ancestors eating your food", "selftext": "So far this year I've lost 17 pounds towards my goal of losing 20 pounds in 2020. While it's too early to declare victory, here are two visual aids I've been using to keep my mindset on track.\n\nThe first is very practical and accurate, the second is a bit weird. The first visual is a car\u2019s fuel gauge. If the car runs out of gas, you are totally screwed. You might be stuck on the side of a mountain road, at night, in a snowstorm. You might get hit by a truck just because you ran out of gas.\n\nYou don\u2019t want your car to run out of fuel, and you personally don\u2019t want to run out of food energy. You will get headaches, you will get dizzy, you might stumble off a curb and get hit by a truck, maybe even the same truck. However, and this is important, you almost never need to be full.\n\nIn America there are gas stations every 10 miles, far more in some places. There\u2019s just no reason to have a belly full of food, since almost every gas station these days has more calories than a small country had a thousand years ago. If you really get hungry, have a snack, order a pizza, grab an apple, drink a Coolatta, it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nSo have three meals a day, but keep your tank about half full, less snacks, no dessert, more water, less second helpings. The second visual is if you are \u201chungry\u201d and tempted to eat an unhealthy snack or dessert, or tempted to have a third or fourth piece of pizza, or ice cream, or a bowl of cereal late at night, imagine this, imagine you are at a table and sitting across from you is one of your ancestors from 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe person across the table is dirty, their hair is matted, and they have not eaten in six days. No one in their family has eaten in six days, no one in their entire tribe. No person they\u2019ve met or ever will meet in their entire life has eaten in six days because it\u2019s winter, they are not having luck hunting, and there simply is no food to be found.\n\nIn all likelihood, if things don't turn around quickly, that person, everyone in their family, and everyone in their tribe will be dead inside of two months.\n\nNow imagine that the snack is in the middle of the table, and before you eat it you need to explain to the smelly person why it is that you, someone who almost always has three meals a day, someone who will have three meals today, someone who will have three meals for every day the rest of the year, someone who has ample body fat, someone has a pantry full of food and a wallet full of credit cards, needs the snack more than they do.\n\nYou could start with something like, \u201cOg, while it's true that six days is a long time, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fully appreciating the stress that I'm under at work...\u201d and then THUMP, your head is smashed into the table by Og right before he grabs the snack and divides it among his five children.\n\nDon\u2019t piss off Og, let him have the bowl of cheetos, because if Og dies you die, because he's your direct ancestor, and if he doesn't make it through the winter, you were never born.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/ipw6xf/visualize_your_ancestors_eating_your_food/", "created_utc": 1599710878.0, "score": 1606, "author": "pbw", "num_comments": 103, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/ipw6xf/visualize_your_ancestors_eating_your_food/", "html_title": ""}

Additionally I know a lot of people around here are trying to lose weight or up their fitness, so you're already getting too many nutrients or know to not eat only chicken mcnuggets every meal. \n\nThere's some evidence that a partial Vit D deficiency can have mental effects like lethargy, so if you're worried about that then take a Vit D supplement, but you really do not need to worry about whether your diet is getting enough nutrients or if things like tea are going to prevent you from getting nutrients. Just eat a balanced diet in moderation. If you\u2019re consuming most food groups most days, you\u2019re fine. \n\nEdit: pregnancy especially folic acid is an exception to this rant. Talk to your obgyn about pregnancy nutrition\n\nEdit 2: A lot of people are talking about iron deficiency for females. Yes if you feel lethargic or have heavy menses, make sure you\u2019re eating ideally meat daily. But this just reiterates the point of just trying to get in some of each food group most days. You don\u2019t need to micromanage every thing you eat as long as you do this\n\nEdit 3: My premise is not \u201cthere\u2019s no use for supplemental nutrients\u201d.

This is not true. While it is true that fat contains more calories per gram than carbohydrates and protein, eating fat does not directly cause weight gain. In fact, certain types of fats, such as unsaturated fats, can be part of a healthy diet and are important for heart health.*\n\n*Another common nutrition myth is that carbohydrates are bad for you. This is also not true. Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for the body and are found in many healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.*\n\n*It's also a myth that all processed foods are unhealthy. Some processed foods, such as canned fruits and vegetables, can be a convenient and nutritious part of a balanced diet. However, it's important to be mindful of the amount and type of processing that foods undergo and to limit those that are high in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.*\n\n*It's important to base your nutrition choices on scientific evidence and to be skeptical of diets or eating patterns that are not supported by credible research. A balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods and minimizes processed foods and added sugars is typically the best approach for overall health and wellness.*\u201d\n\n\\[1\\] [Gil Carvalho asked ChatGPT a question about nutrition and posted its response on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NutritionMadeS3/status/1624853956613529603)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/110yx7g/chatgpt_beats_95_of_nutrition_health_influencers/", "created_utc": 1676261140.0, "score": 725, "author": "EDXE47_", "num_comments": 94, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/110yx7g/chatgpt_beats_95_of_nutrition_health_influencers/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Store your veg the right way to last longer, decrease grocery trips, and save money.", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nSince people are probably not heading out the grocery stores as often, I wanted to share some tips I use to keep my produce fresh, which saves money, and will reduce how often I need to go to the store since I can buy more when I'm there.I feel like I also eat more veg when I do this, because it is easier to see them this way than stuck in the vegetable drawers.\n\n\\*\\*Greens\\*\\*: Kale, chard, asparagus, broccoli, mustard greens, collards, etc: I put these in old pickle jars (or whatever size jar will work best for them based on size, remove any rubberbands or bread ties, and fill the jar with water. I moved the middle drawer in my fridge up to a higher rack so it was easier to do this. I have also stored them in the fridge door. It makes using them a lot easier, since you just pluck a few out the jar when you need them.\n\n\\*\\*Carrots and celery\\*\\*: I cut the stalks or the carrots into thirds and store them in a covered container filled with water. Sometimes I have carrots and celery on the brink of death of this always brings them back to life after a day or two. Try to change the water every few days if you remember. Sometimes I will chop half the veg into thirds, and the other half I will chop into thirds and then quarter (carrots) or halve (celery) each third so they are ready for dipping into hummus. Makes grabbing a healthy snack easier when they are already cut up and ready to go.\n\n\\*\\*Berries\\*\\*: Let the berries soak in a mix of distilled white vinegar and water for 10-15 minutes and then dry on a towel. While they are drying soak the container they are in, in the vinegar water. You only need like 1 part vinegar for 19 parts water to prevent food borne pathogens (they die at a pH of below 4.6, this ratio is about 3.7 pH if using 5% vinegar). I keep my vinegar in a squeezable, refillable container, so I probably end up with a higher vinegar ratio.

{"title": "Four reasons why you probably eat more (or less) calories than you might think", "selftext": "Sorry if my title sounds clickbait-y, and I admit this is probably common knowledge on this subreddit (especially for those who count calories), but I decided to share my approach on why it is so hard for many people to lose or gain weight. \n\nGoing in-depth with examples and scenarios is a good way to truly understand what's going on from day-to-day and why two persons who appear to eat the same thing might have totally different bodies (fat vs skinny).\n\n\nSo... let's start.\n\n**#1 : Consistency is key**\n\nDon't think of one day, think of **one week**. If you don't count calories, it's easy to get misleading approximations about what you eat, especially if you do not have a routine. Not all meals are equal, some are definitely more calorie dense than others even if they appear to be as filling. \n\nLet's say your maintenance level is at 2300 calories, and you try to make some efforts to lose some weight in a non-drastic way (averaging -300 to -400 calories per day). Let's see how it might pan out on a whole week :\n\n- Day 1 : 1900 calories (-400)\n\n- Day 2 : 2000 calories (-300)\n\n- Day 3 : 3000 calories (+700) (You underestimated a meal and drank two beers with your buddy)\n\n- Day 4 : 2000 calories (-300)\n\n- Day 5 : 2950 calories (+650) (Friday)\n\n- Day 6 : 2050 calories (-250) \n\n- Day 7 : 2000 calories (-300)\n\n\nIn your mind, you thought you did a good job. Overall, you had 5 successful days!\n\nThe problem is that if you combine the numbers, you end up with only a -200 negative result over the whole week, which is roughly -29 calories per day. At the end of your next week, if you end up with a +200 positive result, you've basically been at maintenance for two weeks!\n\nBeing consistent is hard, as all it takes is a single day to screw you over (same for gaining weight). That's why counting calories is so effective. If you knew at days #3 and #5 that you consumed a total of 1350 extra calories, you'd make sure to consume a greater deficit during the remaining days.\n\nBeing active, doing cardio and playing sports regularly also help, as it helps you being consistent on the negative side. If you subtract an average of 150 calories per day because of your active life, then suddenly, you end up with -1250 calories at the end of the week despise eating way too much on days #3 and #5. Not too bad!\n\n**#2 : Don't underestimate cheat days**\n\n\nSimilar to reason #1, but in a more drastic way. Let's say you have a proper diet, not counting calories, and every Friday you tell yourself \"fuck my diet for tonight, I'm gonna eat pizza and drink booze\".\n\nTo simplify things, let's assume that from days 1 to 6, you average -250 calories per day, which is a slow-ish deficit rate. That's -1500 calories over 6 days.\n\nNow, friday night. Your friends are over, you eat pizza. That meal consists of an extra 500 calories than usual. Over the night, you drink some beers, about 4 regular ones. That's about 500 calories. During the whole evening and night, you also eat some chips or other junk food for an extra 500 calories.\n\nBoom, that's an extra 1500 calories. You went from a negative -1500 calories to a maintenance level just because you ate pizza, drank 4 beers and ate some chips in the span of no more than a couple hours!\n\nThis is exactly why diets like keto work so well with most people. Keto doesn't allow you to have cheat days like this, because naturally most cheat days consist of an insane amount of carbs. (Most) people don't go on cheat days and eat 4 avocados, 1/2 lb of nuts or 2 kilos of tofu. They go on cheat days and proceed to eat junk food and beer. In other words, carbs aren't the devil, they just happen to be present in most junk-food we eat. \n\n**#3 : It's all in the small details**\n\nSmall details can make a **drastic difference** over a long period of time. When people say \"I don't eat that much and I'm fat!\" or \"I eat a lot and don't gain weight!\", they tend to forget about the small details of their daily routine.\n\nLet's take person A and person B working in an office. Both seem like they eat pretty much the same thing, but person B will definitely become fatter.\n\n- Breakfast : Person B drinks an extra glass of milk. +140 calories\n\n- Snack : Person A doesn't snack before lunch. Person B eats a small amount of nuts in his cubicle. +100 calories\n\n- Lunch : Person A uses mustard in his sandwich. Person B uses mayonnaise. +90 calories\n\n- Snack : Person A doesn't snack before dinner. Person B eats a banana in his cubicle. +90 calories\n\n- Dinner : Person A and B both eat the same meal.\n\n- Late evening : Person A doesn't eat anything. Person B eats a small portion of yogurt before going to bed. +80 calories\n\n- Throughout the day : Person A drank two black coffees. Person B drank two coffees with milk and sugar. +80 calories\n\nOverall, person B has consumed an **extra 580 calories!** And yet, both persons ate very similar meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), and person B did eat healthy food as snacks, so as an outside perspective it's hard to imagine that person B might get much fatter than person A.\n\nAlso, small details appear within a meal :\n\n- How much oil do you use? Do you like your salads with a crapload of vinaigrette, or a small amount? Do you use a lot of mayo, or little mayo or any other low-calorie dense condiments? Do you often incorporate butter in your meals? Do you drink milk/juice, or only water? Do you add milk and sugar in your coffee? Do you pour sauces over your meat? How often do you eat desserts? Are you more of a red meat consumer, or a white meat / fish consumer? Do you put grated parmesan on all pasta dishes? Do you consume bread with your pasta dishes? Do you generally drink light beers or calorie dense craft beers such as IPAs?\n\nI could go on and on... small details can add up, *really* fast.\n\n\n**#4 : Just because it's healthy or healthier doesn't mean it won't make you fatter**\n\n\nIt's easy to assume that just because you eat healthy food, you're going to lose weight. But unless you go from a really shitty diet to a really healthy diet, it doesn't mean you're going to lose weight.\n\nA banana has nearly 100 calories. An apple has nearly 60 calories. Avocados are high in calories, as well as nuts. If you eat brown bread or pasta, it's still packed with calories, it's just healthier for you than white bread/pasta. Your \"healthy\" granola bar has probably the same amount of calories than your crappy one. etc...\n\nIncorporating healthy snacks throughout the day can be problematic if you weren't eating snacks before, for example. *\"I'm gonna start eating more fruits!\"* Simply switching to a more healthier brand won't necessarily make a difference (granola bars, chips, crackers, etc) either. Yes, healthy foods can make you feel full more easily, reducing your hunger, which can potentially make you lose weight over a long period of time... but you can't take healthy food for granted. Calories are calories, so whenever you look up a \"healthy looking\" product, look up for the label. \n\n**Heck, some people might grab a healthier brand of chips that has about 60% the amount of calories than Doritos, but they end up eating more of it!** Because they know it's technically healthier and less calorie dense, in their mind, they can eat more of it without feeling guilty. At the end of the day, you're still going to consume a crazy amount of calories.

The present study is based on the hypothesis that, heating of edible oils to their boiling points results in the formation of free radicals that cause oxidative stress and induce damage at the cellular and molecular levels. Peroxide value of heated oil, histopathological alterations, antioxidant enzyme levels and blood biochemistry were determined in Wistar rats treated with the RHCO. RHCO revealed higher peroxide value in comparison to oil that has been unheated or singly heated. Histopathological observation depicted significant damage in jejunum, colon and liver of animals that received oil heated repeatedly for 3 times. The altered antioxidant status reflects an adaptive response to oxidative stress. Alteration in the levels of these enzymes might be due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through auto oxidation or enzyme catalyzed oxidation of electrophilic components within RHCO. Analysis of blood samples revealed elevated levels of glucose, creatinine and cholesterol with declined levels of protein and albumin in repeatedly heated cooking oil group. Hematological parameters did not reveal any statistically significant difference between treated and control groups. Results of the present study confirm that the thermal oxidation of cooking oil generates free radicals and dietary consumption of such oil results in detrimental health effects.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/ll9ih4/consumption_of_repeatedly_heated_vegetable_oil_by/", "created_utc": 1613498341.0, "score": 538, "author": "Bluest_waters", "num_comments": 100, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/ll9ih4/consumption_of_repeatedly_heated_vegetable_oil_by/", "html_title": ""}

In mice fed a diet high in fat, there are many key gut population changes, such as the absence of gut barrier-protecting Bifidobacteria spp. \n\nOverall, dietary changes could explain 57% of the total structural variation in gut microbiota whereas changes in genetics accounted for no more than 12% [45]. \n\n**This indicates that diet has a dominating role in shaping gut microbiota** and changing key populations may transform healthy gut microbiota into a disease-inducing entity. For example, the \u201cWestern\u201d diet, which is high in sugar and fat, causes dysbiosis which affects both host GI tract metabolism and immune homeostasis [46]. This was modeled in a humanized mouse model where adult human fecal microbiota was transplanted into GF mice. The mice were fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet and when switched to a \u201cWestern\u201d diet, the microbiota composition shifted to an overgrowth of Firmicutes including Clostridium innocuum, Eubacterium dolichum, Catenibacterium mitsuokai and Enterococcus spp., as well as a significant reduction in several Bacteroides spp. [18]. In mice, carbohydrate-reduced diets result in enriched populations of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla, [47] and calorie-restricted diets prevent the growth of Clostridium coccoides, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacteria spp., which are all major butyrate producers required for colonocyte homeostasis [48]. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates show less pathogenic species such as Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and Enterobacteriaceae [49] than diets higher in fat or protein [48,50,51,52]. \n\nComplex carbohydrates also increase levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria spp. such as B. longum subspecies longum, B. breve and B. thetaiotaomicron [53]. **Refined sugars, on the other hand, mediate the overgrowth of opportunistic bacteria like C. difficile [54] and C. perfringens by increasing bile output** [55].\n\n Vegetarianism alters intestinal microbiota in humans because high amounts of fiber result in increased short chain fatty acid production by microbes which decrease the intestinal pH. This prevents the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae [56]. \n\nInterestingly, it has been found that European children have a microbiota depleted of Bacteroidetes and enriched in Enterobacteriaceae compared to rural African children which the authors attributed to low dietary fiber intake by Europeans", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/b1npoy/overall_dietary_changes_could_explain_57_of_the/", "created_utc": 1552704851.0, "score": 487, "author": "Bluest_waters", "num_comments": 55, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/b1npoy/overall_dietary_changes_could_explain_57_of_the/", "html_title": ""}

Here is why.", "selftext": "First off beans are the cornerstone for every blue zone diet in the world\n\nhttps://www.bluezones.com/2016/06/10-things-about-beans/\n\nSo there's that. But for the microbiome they are incredible. First understand how important Resistant starch is for the microbiome.\n\nhttps://www.dermveda.com/articles/why-you-should-eat-resistant-starch-for-a-healthy-microbiome\n\n>Resistant starch is metabolized by microbes in the gut to produce molecules called short chain fatty acids, such as acetate, butyrate and propionate. These short chain fatty acids have significant health benefits, including cancer fighting benefits and anti-inflammatory effects.[4,5] Diets high in resistant starch lead to higher levels of short chain fatty acids and may offer protection against colon inflammation and disease.[6] The dietary fiber that is fermented by our gut microorganisms are referred to as \u201cprebiotics,\u201d leading to the production of beneficial short chain fatty acids and other molecules, including serotonin and deoxycholic acid.[7,8]\n\n>Eating resistant starch may even improve problems with insulin regulation, including insulin resistance and diabetes.[9]\n\nhttps://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/en/new-review-explores-latest-knowledge-resistant-starch-nutrition-modulator-gut-microbiota/\n\n>In addition, RS (resistant starch) has specific beneficial effects on the gut environment including increased populations of Ruminococcus bromii -a dominant member of the phylum Firmicutes that plays a primary role in releasing energy from dietary starches that escape digestion by host enzymes through its exceptional activity against particulate resistant starches. Besides this, ingestion of food products rich in RS has been shown to increase luminal short-chain fatty acid levels, modulate microbial metabolism and improve markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity\n\n>Regarding cell signalling pathways that can explain physiological effects of RS, using animal models it has been well documented that **resistant starch has strong anti-inflammatory properties**\n\nAnd beans are far and away the best source of resistant starch in our diets. They have many more times the RS as any other commonly eaten food. See here for more.\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/11/16/ask-the-expert-legumes-and-resistant-starch/\n\nEating beans may even alter the microbiome in such a way as to kill cancer cells!\n\nhttps://www.healio.com/gastroenterology/oncology/news/online/%7B1d9afc8b-cef1-4b45-94bc-61dbfc08144b%7D/rice-bran-navy-beans-boost-gut-microbiome-slow-crc-cell-growth\n\n>To evaluate the chemopreventive effects of rice bran and navy bean intake, Ryan and colleagues performed a phase 2 pilot study (the BENEFIT trial), in which they randomly assigned 29 CRC survivors to consume 30 grams of rice bran per day, 35 grams of navy bean powder per day, or neither for 4 weeks.\n\n>They found that increased consumption of rice bran and navy beans led to higher dietary levels of fiber, iron, zinc, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, and alpha-tocopherol. Further, stool microbiome analyses revealed the rice bran group had increased gut microbial richness and diversity, and the navy bean group showed increased gut microbial richness.\n\n>Notably, analysis of human stool metabolite extracts before and after the dietary intervention showed increased intake of rice bran or navy beans reduced growth of colorectal cancer cells.\n\nThere's more but thats all I will post for now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/athyam/beans_may_be_the_very_best_thing_you_can_eat_for/", "created_utc": 1550844195.0, "score": 457, "author": "Bluest_waters", "num_comments": 158, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/athyam/beans_may_be_the_very_best_thing_you_can_eat_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My take on the Creatine/Caffeine debate", "selftext": "I have read about this in a few magazines recently as well as hearing it from some of my clients. The idea that you should not take creatine and caffeine together as creatine causes water retention while caffeine causes water loss. In other words, the two supplements cancel each other out.\n\nI wanted to address this for anyone confused about this. Quick rundown of my creds: Bachelor's degree in Human Kinetics, certified with International Sports Science Association as a fitness trainer, nutrition coach and S&C coach. 5 years experience as a personal trainer. Avid reader of scientific literature in the realm of sports medicine. Lover of both coffee and creatine :)\n\nFirstly, I would like to mention something often overlooked in the explanation for why these two supplements oppose each other; water manipulation is neither the main function of creatine, nor caffeine. At least in the way people primarily use these supplements.\n\nCreatine increases creatine phosphate stores in the muscles, improving athletic performance, particularly in short bouts of high-intensity effort. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors (our \"tiredness\" receptors) improving energy levels, focus and overall athletic performance. With these functions in mind, it is clear that these two supplements do not antagonise, but rather synergise to improve athletic performance.\n\nLastly, the water changes associated with creatine and caffeine are fairly negligible. Furthermore, there are very few contexts where one would use these supplements specifically for their water manipulation effects. One would be the use of caffeine to cause water loss for a weight-class athlete to 'make weight'. Another would be a bodybuilder hoping to use creatine's water retention to 'puff up'. (Not that it would make much difference since the maximum water retention throughout the body from creatine use appears to be around 2lbs).\n\nThese magazines and so-called experts neglect to address these very specific contexts and instead treat them as the rule, rather than the exception. (I believe this is just for the sake of being controversial and edgy, but that's a discussion for another day).\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?\n\nTL;DR: Creatine and caffeine can be used synergistically to improve athletic performance with consistently proven success. The difference observed in athletic performance is far more significant than the difference in water retention/loss.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/gqyt3o/my_take_on_the_creatinecaffeine_debate/", "created_utc": 1590505826.0, "score": 413, "author": "BroCast97", "num_comments": 84, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/gqyt3o/my_take_on_the_creatinecaffeine_debate/", "html_title": ""}

I thought I would share here as well in case anyone else finds it useful.\n\nBasically, my wife and I are doing a BlueApron/HomeChef meal planning, but we're doing it with a couple of apps.  The best part about it is that we're not shipping food across the country, we're buying it from our local grocery stores -- yet still having it delivered to our house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt involves two apps (note: I am not affiliated with either of these apps)\n\n* [Mealime](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealime-meal-plans-recipes/id1079999103?mt=8)  \u2014 this is a great recipe app; it allows you to schedule your meals,  filter recipes on your personal food preferences -- you can specify low carb, keto, paleo, vegetarian, flexitarian, etc -- you can even list ingredients you don't like or are allergic to.  The recipes are all high quality, beautifully photographed, and easy to read.  Most importantly, it lets you  upload your shopping list to Instacart, which brings me to the second  app.\n* [Instacart](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacart/id545599256?mt=8) \u2014 order groceries from local grocery stores and *have them delivered the same day*.   So, instead of picking out meals and shipping your groceries from  across the country, you\u2019re just ordering from stores you probably  already shop.  I believe there\u2019s either a delivery fee, or you can sign  up for $99/year (in which case any order over $35 is free).  Either way, it\u2019s probably cheaper than any of the home  chef options out there.\n\nSo, when we plan our meals for the week, it all goes into Instacart.  Then we take out the stuff we have already, and hit the order button.  It usually arrives at our door in an hour or two.  Much cheaper, more convenient, and quicker than other meal prep services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: [Check Instacart availability in your area](https://www.instacart.com/grocery-delivery).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/b11j0q/how_my_wife_and_i_do_our_version_of_blueapron_but/", "created_utc": 1552576607.0, "score": 411, "author": "strong_grey_hero", "num_comments": 92, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/b11j0q/how_my_wife_and_i_do_our_version_of_blueapron_but/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Researchers find that broccoli should chopped into smaller pieces and left to stand for 30+ minutes before cooking to maximize the enzymatic release of anti-carcinogenic isothiocyanates", "selftext": "Abstract:\n\nBroccoli is found to be a good source of glucosinolates, which can be hydrolyzed by endogenous myrosinase to obtain chemopreventive isothiocyanates (ITCs); among them, sulforaphane (SF) is the most important agent. Studies have shown that cooking greatly affects the levels of SF and total ITCs in broccoli. However, the stability of these compounds during cooking has been infrequently examined. In this study, we proved that the half-lives of SF and total ITCs during stir-frying were 7.7 and 5.9 min, respectively, while the myrosinase activity decreased by 80% after stir-frying for 3 min; SF and total ITCs were more stable than myrosinase. Thus, the contents of SF and total ITCs decreased during stir-frying largely because myrosinase was destroyed. Subsequently, it was confirmed that compared to direct stir-frying, hydrolysis of glucosinolates in broccoli for 90 min followed by stir-frying increased the SF and total ITC concentration by 2.8 and 2.6 times, respectively. This method provides large quantities of beneficial ITCs even after cooking.\n\nOriginal Link:\n\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b05913\n\nPDF:\n\nhttp://docdro.id/tc6EM19", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/7vpi3w/researchers_find_that_broccoli_should_chopped/", "created_utc": 1517942527.0, "score": 408, "author": "None", "num_comments": 69, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/7vpi3w/researchers_find_that_broccoli_should_chopped/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Is the gross popularity and marketing of protein shakes a huge sham?", "selftext": "Now, I understand the benefits of the convenience of protein shakes to hit daily protein goals. It makes it easier, especially for those who have diet restrictions, on a huge bulk or lack the time or ability to cook. But what I'm referring to is the image of the protein shake that is sold on to the public. The idea that you grab a protein shake, do your workout and scuff it down as fast as you can in fear of losing the hard earned gains you just made is proliferated with every novice gym-goer (myself included). When anyone starts a fitness regime, they buy protein powder in bulk. It's almost seen as a necessity to building muscle.\n\nBut if you do some research on nutrient timing, daily nutrition etc, anyone can easily see that to a general extent the timing of your food intake does not matter except maybe having some carbs in you in the few hours before or after a workout; protein-wise, it doesn't seem to make a difference. This throws the necessity of the protein shake completely out the window. Even the idea of needing a shake bottle makes no sense - you can just go home and stir it in a glass and drink and don't need to leave a gross unwashed bottle with a foul smell in the sink for days. The 20g of protein per scoop is such a minuscule amount if you compare it to just cooking the extra amount when you make your meals.\n\nSo for the basic gym go-er, why is the protein shake seen as such a necessity? Am I missing something or is it wholly a luxury for convenience except for those on large bulks or extremely precise and clean cuts or specific diet restrictions?

{"title": "Could copying eating habits of healthy people with normal weight be the key to fighting obesity?", "selftext": "I've noticed that most diets and nutritional regimens out there just try to fix the damage that's already done by excessive weight or obesity, either by trying to cause the weight loss through calorie deficit, or by trying to undo health damage through healthier food choices. But few of them are concerned about very long term eating patterns one needs to have in order to be and stay healthy and within healthy weight range.\n\nI also feel there's been too few studies about eating habits of healthy, normal weight people... also too few studies about how the typical eating habits of overweight and obese people differ from eating habits of healthy, normal weight people.\n\nIn my opinion instead of trying to make short term fix by undoing the damage that has already been caused by overweight and obesity, it would be much wiser to try and see how we can make long term modifications to eating habits of overweight and obese people to make their eating habits more alike eating habits of healthy people.\n\nSo my hypothesis is that if overweight and obese people simply copied the eating habits of healthy, normal weight people, that would be enough to rid them of their obesity permanently and in long term. So there's no need for much philosophy... simply eat what healthy people already eat, and you're on your way to become like them. The extra weight wouldn't go overnight... It might take a couple of years until the body adapts to a new eating pattern and until the weight stabilizes on a new, healthier level. So the lack of immediate results would be discouraging to many. But I really believe this is the only way to a long term solution.\n\nIt's interesting to note that sometimes people make such kind of dietary changes unintentionally... It can be the result of moving to another country that has healthier eating patterns, or simply marrying a spouse who has different habits when it comes to food. Simply adapting your eating habits to such a new environment could in long term lead to a sustainable weight loss...

Specifically about nutrition, people will tend to read and comment on epidemiological studies, because those are easy to understand. But in doing so, we may be under the impression that scientists know less than they do.\n\nFor example, in a recent post about processed meats, many people claimed that the evidence against processed meats was purely based on correlation rather than causation. You may conclude this if you only look at epidemiological studies with human participants, but they are not the only types of studies that have been performed.\n\nWhen one looks into studies about, for instance, cancer and processed meats, we need to keep in mind that many relevant studies will not be obvious. For example, this is a completely non-sensical made-up title, mind you: \"Aminoacids react with nitrate and cause activation of the GPJY-3 pathway in colonocytes in rats.\" This study will probably never be discussed here, but let's assume that it actually shows how a compound found in processed meats cause activation of some metabolic and genetic pathways linked to cancer in the colon. But because you don't understand it, you'll ignore it.\n\nWe all have a tendency to ignore what we don't understand, and in nutrition it might lead to wrong conclusions. In short, my message is that nutrition isn't 100% based on studies where people eat this or that and then you see what happens. These are the studies that we tend to focus on, because they are the ones we can more easily understand. But a true nutrition expert (that's not me) will read many more studies on biochemistry, genetics, and so on, which are often not obviously about food, but are actually the ones that tell us what nutrients and toxins actually do to our bodies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/tby2ye/about_scientific_studies_on_nutrition_from_a/", "created_utc": 1647027062.0, "score": 349, "author": "UncensoredMQ", "num_comments": 67, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/tby2ye/about_scientific_studies_on_nutrition_from_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Protein is killing you?", "selftext": "I'm currently reading \"How Not to Age,\" by Michael Greger. He emphatically recommends lowering, or ideally entirely cutting out animal protein, and reducing overall protein intake to around the RDI. He cites a convincing amount of literature suggesting that the constant stream of IGF-1 resulting from high protein diets (even from vegetarian sources) torpedos longevity and dramatically increases risk of cancer and heart disease.\n\nContrast that with other researchers (like that of Peter Attia for instance) who argue that a protein intake of 2-3x the RDI is critical for building and maintaining muscle, especially as we age. He recommends *increasing* protein intake, especially as one gets older, since frailty is as great a risk as any other morbidity. Attia also seems to think the the apparent link between animal protein and disease is not justified by the data.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the alleged risks of a high protein diet vs the alleged risks of a low protein diet? Is there a sweet spot of enough protein to build and maintain muscle and strength while still minimizing risk of cancer?

In January, **a new large-scale study using data from 262,195 British women suggested that consuming just 9g of bacon a day \u2013 less than a rasher \u2013 could significantly raise the risk of developing breast cancer later in life. The study\u2019s lead author, Jill Pell from the Institute of Health and Wellbei**ng at Glasgow University, told me that while it can be counterproductive to push for total abstinence, the scientific evidence suggests \u201cit would be misleading\u201d for health authorities to set any safe dose for processed meat \u201cother than zero\u201d.\n\nThe real scandal of bacon, however, is that it didn\u2019t have to be anything like so damaging to our health. **The part of the story we haven\u2019t been told \u2013 including by the WHO \u2013 is that there were always other ways to manufacture these products that would make them significantly less carcinogenic**. The fact that this is so little known is tribute to the power of the meat industry, which has for the past 40 years been engaged in a campaign of cover-ups and misdirection to rival the dirty tricks of Big Tobacco.\n\nsnip\n\n\u201cPure insane crazy madness\u201d is how Coudray described the continuing use of nitrates and nitrites in processed meats, in an email to me. The madness, in his view, is that it is possible to make bacon and ham in ways that would be less carcinogenic. The most basic way to cure any meat is to salt it \u2013 either with a dry salt rub or a wet brine \u2013 and to wait for time to do the rest. Coudray notes that ham and bacon manufacturers claim this old-fashioned way of curing isn\u2019t safe. But the real reason they reject it is cost: it takes much longer for processed meats to develop their flavour this way, which cuts into profits.\n\nsnip\n\nBut something different happens when nitrates are used in meat processing. **When nitrates interact with certain components in red meat (haem iron, amines and amides), they form N-nitroso compounds, which cause cancer. The best known of these compounds is nitrosamine. This, as Guillaume Coudray explained to me in an email, is known to be \u201ccarcinogenic even at a very low dose\u201d** . Any time someone eats bacon, ham or other processed meat, their gut receives a dose of nitrosamines, which damage the cells in the lining of the bowel, and can lead to cancer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/81m59b/yes_bacon_really_is_killing_us_decades_worth_of/", "created_utc": 1520047692.0, "score": 341, "author": "Bluest_waters", "num_comments": 86, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/81m59b/yes_bacon_really_is_killing_us_decades_worth_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Food and nutrient intakes were assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Skin wrinkling was measured using a cutaneous microtopographic method.\n\nResults: SWE elderly had the least skin wrinkling in a sun-exposed site, followed by GRM, GRG and ACA. Correlation analyses on the pooled data and using the major food groups suggested that there may be less actinic skin damage with a higher intake of vegetables (rs=\u22120.31, p<0.0001), olive oil (rs=\u22120.29, p<0.0001), fish (rs=\u22120.24, p<0.0001) and legumes (rs=\u22120.16, p<0.0001), and lower intakes of butter (rs=0.46, p<0.0001) and margarine (rs=0.24, p<0.001), milk products (rs=0.16, p<0.01) and sugar products (rs=0.12, p<0.01). Similar findings were obtained using regression analyses, except fish was no longer significant; 32% of the variance for actinic skin damage was predicted by six out of the ten major food groups. In particular, a high intake of vegetables, legumes and olive oil appeared to be protective against cutaneous actinic damage (collectively explaining 20% of the variance); a high intake of meat, dairy and butter appeared to be adverse (explaining <5% of the variance).

{"title": "Which frying oils are best? Smoke point actually isn't a good indicator. (Science discussion: \"Potential Adverse Public Health Effects Afforded by the Ingestion of Dietary Lipid Oxidation Product Toxins: Significance of Fried Food Sources\" Apr 2020)", "selftext": "Crosspost from:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/h9wzzh/potential_adverse_public_health_effects_afforded/\n\nThe article is here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254282/\n\n>**Abstract:** Exposure of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich culinary oils (COs) to high temperature frying practices generates high concentrations of cytotoxic and genotoxic lipid oxidation products (LOPs) via oxygen-fueled, recycling peroxidative bursts. These toxins, including aldehydes and epoxy-fatty acids, readily penetrate into fried foods and hence are available for human consumption; therefore, they may pose substantial health hazards. Although previous reports have claimed health benefits offered by the use of PUFA-laden COs for frying purposes, these may be erroneous in view of their failure to consider the negating adverse public health threats presented by food-transferable LOPs therein. When absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) system into the systemic circulation, such LOPs may significantly contribute to enhanced risks of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), e.g. , cancer, along with cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Herein, we provide a comprehensive rationale relating to the public health threats posed by the dietary ingestion of LOPs in fried foods. We begin with an introduction to sequential lipid peroxidation processes, describing the noxious effects of LOP toxins generated therefrom. We continue to discuss GI system interactions, the metabolism and biotransformation of primary lipid hydroperoxide LOPs and their secondary products, and the toxicological properties of these agents, prior to providing a narrative on chemically-reactive, secondary aldehydic LOPs available for human ingestion. In view of a range of previous studies focused on their deleterious health effects in animal and cellular model systems, some emphasis is placed on the physiological fate of the more prevalent and toxic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes. We conclude with a description of targeted nutritional and interventional strategies, whilst highlighting the urgent and unmet clinical need for nutritional and epidemiological trials probing relationships between the incidence of NCDs, and the frequency and estimated quantities of dietary LOP intake.\n\nTL;DR: This is a very large review of the evidence of frying oil degradation.\n\nThe practical conclusions are that polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs, omega 6 + omega 3), which are a large component of most vegetable oils, are the most reactive and unstable, producing \"lipid oxidation products\" including \"toxic aldehydes\", which have good evidence for being a major source of harm in the average diet. \n\nThus, these oils really shouldn't be used for for deepfrying. Better choices would be ones that have low PUFA content, meaning high monounsaturated (olive, avocado, hi-oleic safflower) or high saturated (coconut, tallow).

Again, similar to Ash, it causes some weird-ass dreams though.\n\n**Bananas** \\- Similar to the above minus the weird-ass dreams. Bananas help produce melatonin (the chemical that gets released when you sleep), and the sugar in them makes you crash within 30-45 minutes, (usually) leaving you feel tired and ready for sleep.\n\nMy question to you guys is, which foods seem to improve (your) sleep quality?

Data were analyzed from October 2018 through April 2020.\n\n**Exposures**  Validated baseline food frequency questionnaire dietary information, including intake of plant protein and animal protein.\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Hazard ratios and 16-year absolute risk differences for overall mortality and cause-specific mortality.\n\n**Results**  The final analytic cohort included 237\u202f036 men (57%) and 179\u202f068 women. Their overall median (SD) ages were 62.2 (5.4) years for men and 62.0 (5.4) years for women.

The association between plant protein intake and overall mortality was similar across the subgroups of smoking status, diabetes, fruit consumption, vitamin supplement use, and self-reported health status. **Replacement of 3% energy from animal protein with plant protein was inversely associated with overall mortality (risk decreased 10% in both men and women) and cardiovascular disease mortality (11% lower risk in men and 12% lower risk in women). In particular, the lower overall mortality was attributable primarily to substitution of plant protein for egg protein (24% lower risk in men and 21% lower risk in women) and red meat protein (13% lower risk in men and 15% lower risk in women).**\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this large prospective cohort, higher plant protein intake was associated with small reductions in risk of overall and cardiovascular disease mortality.

Now call me crazy but a diet that is 40% fat I wouldn't call a high fat diet.\n\nThey used Soybean Oil as the main fat source for the high fat group.

Here is a quote\n\n\"It should be noted that the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was relatively high in the higher-fat diet group (24% of total energy) owing to exclusive use of soybean oil, which is rich in n-6 PUFA.

However, 42% of energy intake was still derived from low-quality carbohydrates and the intake of saturated fat remained above 10% of energy.\n\nMeaning  The macronutrient composition of diet among US adults has improved, but continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remain.\n\nAbstract\nImportance  Changes in the economy, nutrition policies, and food processing methods can affect dietary macronutrient intake and diet quality. It is essential to evaluate trends in dietary intake, food sources, and diet quality to inform policy makers.\n\nObjective  To investigate trends in dietary macronutrient intake, food sources, and diet quality among US adults.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Serial cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (1999-2016) among adults aged 20 years or older.\n\nExposure  Survey cycle.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Dietary intake of macronutrients and their subtypes, food sources, and the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been defined).\n\nResults  There were 43\u202f996 respondents (weighted mean age, 46.9 years; 51.9% women). From 1999 to 2016, the estimated energy from total carbohydrates declined from 52.5% to 50.5% (difference, \u22122.02%; 95% CI, \u22122.41% to \u22121.63%), whereas that of total protein and total fat increased from 15.5% to 16.4% (difference, 0.82%; 95% CI, 0.67%-0.97%) and from 32.0% to 33.2% (difference, 1.20%; 95% CI, 0.84%-1.55%), respectively (all P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Estimated energy from low-quality carbohydrates decreased by 3.25% (95% CI, 2.74%-3.75%; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) from 45.1% to 41.8%. Increases were observed in estimated energy from high-quality carbohydrates (by 1.23% [95% CI, 0.84%-1.61%] from 7.42% to 8.65%), plant protein (by 0.38% [95% CI, 0.28%-0.49%] from 5.38% to 5.76%), saturated fatty acids (by 0.36% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.51%] from 11.5% to 11.9%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (by 0.65% [95% CI, 0.56%-0.74%] from 7.58% to 8.23%) (all P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). The estimated overall Healthy Eating Index 2015 increased from 55.7 to 57.7 (difference, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.86-3.16; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Trends in high- and low-quality carbohydrates primarily reflected higher estimated energy from whole grains (0.65%) and reduced estimated energy from added sugars (\u22122.00%), respectively. Trends in plant protein were predominantly due to higher estimated intake of whole grains (0.12%) and nuts (0.09%).\n\nConclusions and Relevance  From 1999 to 2016, US adults experienced a significant decrease in percentage of energy intake from low-quality carbohydrates and significant increases in percentage of energy intake from high-quality carbohydrates, plant protein, and polyunsaturated fat. Despite improvements in macronutrient composition and diet quality, continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remained.\u201d\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2751719", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/da2od2/americans_are_eating_healthier_but_not_healthy/", "created_utc": 1569600992.0, "score": 231, "author": "Only8livesleft", "num_comments": 47, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/da2od2/americans_are_eating_healthier_but_not_healthy/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Findings from the few available studies are inconsistent.\n\n\nObjective: The objective was to examine the dose-response relation between FV consumption and mortality, in terms of both time and rate, in a large prospective cohort of Swedish men and women.\n\n\nDesign: FV consumption was assessed through a self-administrated questionnaire in a population-based cohort of 71,706 participants (38,221 men and 33,485 women) aged 45\u201383 y. We performed a dose-response analysis to evaluate 10th survival percentile differences (PDs) by using Laplace regression and estimated HRs by using Cox regression.\n\n\nResults: During 13 y of follow-up, 11,439 deaths (6803 men and 4636 women) occurred in the cohort. In comparison with 5 servings FV/d, a lower consumption was progressively associated with shorter survival and higher mortality rates. Those who never consumed FV lived 3 y shorter (PD: \u221237 mo; 95% CI: \u221258, \u221216 mo) and had a 53% higher mortality rate (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.99) than did those who consumed 5 servings FV/d. Consideration of fruit and vegetables separately showed that those who never consumed fruit lived 19 mo shorter (PD: \u221219 mo; 95% CI: \u221229, \u221210 mo) than did those who ate 1 fruit/d. Participants who consumed 3 vegetables/d lived 32 mo longer than did those who never consumed vegetables (PD: 32 mo; 96% CI: 13, 51 mo).\n\n\nConclusion: FV consumption <5 servings/d is associated with progressively shorter survival and higher mortality rates.

PhD, MPH, RD    \n   \n **This research was published by:**    \n    \nMenopause Journal -https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/9000/Dairy_intake_is_not_associated_with_improvements.97172.aspx   \n   \n  \n**Concluding quote(s) from:**  \n   \nAbstract  \n\n**Objective:**  \n  \nMenopause represents a period in which bone deterioration is accelerated; thus, primary prevention strategies to address age-related bone loss are crucial. Dairy products contain more than a dozen essential nutrients, including calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and high-quality protein, as well as bioactive compounds that may promote bone mineralization. However, the relationship between dairy consumption and bone health across the menopause transition remains largely unknown. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the change in lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density and the risk of bone fracture by the frequency of dairy intakes among women across the menopausal transition using the publicly available data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation.  \n  \n**Methods:**  \n  \nWe analyzed total dairy foods in four categories of <0.5, 0.5 to <1.5, 1.5 to <2.5, and \u22652.5servings/d or <1.5 and \u22651.5servings/d. A general linear model was used to estimate the association of dairy intake with the 10-year bone mineral density loss rate and a linear mixed model was used to estimate the annualized bone mineral density loss rate of the femoral neck and lumbar spine. A Cox proportional hazard model was applied to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the nontraumatic fractures. Poisson regression was used to determine the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of the nontraumatic fractures. The models were controlled for race/ethnicity, age, height, weight, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol consumption, calcium use, menopausal status, and total caloric intake.  \n  \n**Results:**  \n  \nNo significant differences in bone mineral density change were observed, regardless of baseline menopausal status. No significant differences in the risk of nontraumatic fracture were observed.  \n  \n**Conclusions:**  \n  \nIn this group of US women undergoing the menopausal transition, dairy food intake was neither associated with femoral and spine bone mineral density loss nor the risk of fractures.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/gxzwmj/research_discussion_dairy_intake_is_not/", "created_utc": 1591480723.0, "score": 219, "author": "avivi_", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/gxzwmj/research_discussion_dairy_intake_is_not/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

However, the principles of the Mediterranean diet and relevant data linked to the examples of people living in the five blue zones demonstrate that the key to longevity and the prevention of chronic disease development is not the reduction of dietary or serum cholesterol but the control of systemic inflammation. In this review, we present all the relevant data that supports the view that it is inflammation induced by several factors, such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), that leads to the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) rather than serum cholesterol. The key to reducing the incidence of CVD is to control the activities of PAF and other inflammatory mediators via diet, exercise, and healthy lifestyle choices. The relevant studies and data supporting these views are discussed in this review.\n\nInteresting review of the causes of atherosclerosis, as well as common co-morbiditys, as well as possible dietary and pharmalogical interventions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/8jby67/inflammation_not_cholesterol_is_a_cause_of/", "created_utc": 1526301980.0, "score": 221, "author": "Grok22", "num_comments": 105, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/8jby67/inflammation_not_cholesterol_is_a_cause_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Study: blueberries increase brain activity and improve working memory. Researchers used fMRI to measure real time changes in brain function and blood brain flow with blueberry consumption.", "selftext": "http://www.lifeextension.com/Magazine/2017/11/Blueberries-Enhance-Brain-Blood-Flow/Page-01\n\nBritish researchers conducted a study investigating the impact of using a blueberry concentrate or a placebo for 12 weeks in two groups of older adults (averaging 68 years old).\n\nTheir focus was on brain blood flow, localized brain activation, and cognition.1\n\nWhat makes this study unique is that the scientists evaluated subjects\u2019 brain function with a battery of cognitive tests while the subjects were inside a powerful MRI scanner. This allowed the researchers to observe brain activity in real time, while the subjects performed the tests.1\n\nThis is called a functional MRI (or \u201cfMRI\u201d), and it allows the researchers to detect the activity of areas of the brain that are in use for specific cognitive functions. They can then correlate that activity with the amount of blood flowing to those brain regions.7\n\nHere are findings from this study revealing how blueberries benefit brain health:\n\n1. Blueberries increased brain activity. Compared to the placebo group, subjects in the blueberry-supplemented group showed significant increases in brain activity while taking the cognitive tests.1 The relevant brain areas were those called upon for performance of each of the tests.\n\n2. Blueberries improved blood flow to the grey-matter brain regions. In the blueberry group, the brain blood flow was significantly improved in the grey matter of the parietal and occipital lobe. This is where sensory, touch, and visual information is processed.1 Such changes were not significant in the placebo recipients.\n\n3. Blueberries improved working memory. The blueberry-supplemented people demonstrated improved working memory compared with those receiving placebo.1 Working memory has to do with holding temporary information, like remembering those five items you needed at the grocery store. It\u2019s also important for decision-making.8\n\nThis seminal study revealed in real time the impact of blueberries on cognition in human subjects. It is also the first to link blueberries\u2019 cognitive benefits to specific changes in brain function and blood flow.\n\nOne reason this is exciting is because diminished brain blood flow can sometimes be a cause of acute events like strokes. It also underlies more chronic, slowly progressive problems such as mild cognitive impairment, and it is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s.3-5\n\nThis impressive human study shows us that blueberry anthocyanins have the capacity to enhance brain blood flow, potentially preventing further mental decline.1", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/84qcc8/study_blueberries_increase_brain_activity_and/", "created_utc": 1521150804.0, "score": 221, "author": "Bluest_waters", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/84qcc8/study_blueberries_increase_brain_activity_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Why does the vegan community (including its doctors) not take failure to thrive seriously?", "selftext": "This is something that's been grinding my gears for a while, as someone who used to strive for ethical veganism, who envies the hell out of vegan bodybuilders, and who prefers to minimize risk of atherosclerosis. I've attempted various degrees of plant-based dieting over the years, and have come to the conclusion that a pure plant-based diet, even with a ton of plant-based protein supplements (and supplemental taurine, carnitine, beta alanine, and creatine), is impossible for me. Even now as I'm trying to get as close as possible again, I'm having to consume a very non-trivial amount of whey protein just to avoid the kind of unbearable weakness that I would otherwise experience.\n\nI heard that Michael Klaper was going to take a serious look into this, then I saw a video of him on YouTube saying that basically one \"just has to adjust.\" Which is what they all say.\n\nI would much rather someone say that failure to thrive on a vegan diet is the result of some kind of weird metabolic disorder -- granted that assertion were based on sound science. At least then I might know how to take care of myself better, but no. Everyone just says the same BS.\n\nWhy is this not taken seriously? If the plant-based community really believed in the health of vegan diets then it seems like they should want to understand why some people cannot maintain good health on them. This just doesn't appear to be the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: here is a comment that I made further down the thread that elaborates on my frustrations if anyone is curious. Link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/b320nr/why_does_the_vegan_community_including_its/eix5qht/). Comment here:\n\nI cannot find any detailed cases of FTT promulgated by plant-based doctors, who, in all likelihood, have seen such cases. Therefore there are is no widely promulgated advice from plant-based doctors beyond, \"You'll just adapt.\" There are no case reports detailing underlying causes of FTT, no labs, no follow-ups with other tests, no resolutions, nothing that I can look at that might give me some sense of what might be going on.\n\nSo I have two thoughts as to why this might not exist: 1.) People who try PBD and experience severe enough symptoms do not follow through with PBD and therefore do not seek out any professional help because doing so would be too much of a strain on their lives, so we have no case reports. 2.) The plant-based community, including plant-based doctors, do not provide enough assistance to those trying to transition to a PBD who have significant health problems brought on by transition.\n\nNon-doctors instead say \"it's all in your head\" (happened in this thread) refute the person struggling by saying \"but the science discounts your anecdote\" (happened in this thread) or quote some WHO thing at them and essentially say \"what is happening to you should not be happening/you should not exist\" (happened in this thread) OR gives a number of solutions which fix PBD transitions for many people but will inevitably fail for others, and the follow-up work to figure out why FTT on PBD never happens because the person trying to transition gets frustrated and gives up. People who experience this kind of thing from the plant-based community are probably not going to follow up with a plant-based doctor. In either case, the work to figure out what went wrong is never done, because the people trying to transition quit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/b320nr/why_does_the_vegan_community_including_its/", "created_utc": 1553025258.0, "score": 212, "author": "dissolved_remainder", "num_comments": 285, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/b320nr/why_does_the_vegan_community_including_its/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

To follow this up, she concludes that just eat \"*reasonably healthy*\" and be \"*reasonably active*\" and whatever body type you end up with, that's the one that's best for you!\n\nI tried doing some digging on this claim and found mostly news sites with catchy headlines, such at [[1]](https://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/you_should_never_diet_again_the_science_and_genetics_of_weight_loss/) [[2]](http://www.financialsamurai.com/proof-your-weight-is-almost-entirely-genetic/) [[3]](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/health/08fat.html).

More interestingly, the ScienceMag article cites [this](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/jcem/81/2/10.1210_jcem.81.2.8636274/1/jcem0597.pdf?Expires=1493563010&Signature=MUg0ROgSFmqae-yiHQxXeovTTVZohis60X10Bh3bvDBOEUB0iiLoje4Wwuwu2fecMhjFGCmxPRiuaspRTKTDREmprJ3RHspIvdhNAJZkPD6yE4LJggA8D~Pa5j8rxZwkP08-eBKi5sgJDr-dzdT2S-qvBcPCeCvoSzsmKxQo0e~usE2TBbBIbyvU3Uz0Fgxpj5sN6JiQDQssmFkYc1IyJ-ie06LAFvNPUWPfzrYyEEIghp2o1ace4bMlOtN2Jdgv77Vxg9Eg3lCWi510l6pXXZQes2WTiiwOwgWahkvUhyKHrOgtfWlaxVsytEvy2aQ00F9glu8mqtQ730cMOASCrg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q) study for that figure.

{"title": "A randomized crossover trial on the effect of plant-based compared with animal-based meat on trimethylamine-N-oxide and cardiovascular disease risk factors in generally healthy adults: Study With Appetizing Plantfood\u2014Meat Eating Alternative Trial (SWAP-MEAT)", "selftext": "\u201c Background\nDespite the rising popularity of plant-based alternative meats, there is limited evidence of the health effects of these products.\n\nObjectives\nWe aimed to compare the effect of consuming plant-based alternative meat (Plant) as opposed to animal meat (Animal) on health factors. The primary outcome was fasting serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Secondary outcomes included fasting insulin-like growth factor 1, lipids, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and weight.\n\nMethods\nSWAP-MEAT (The Study With Appetizing Plantfood\u2014Meat Eating Alternatives Trial) was a single-site, randomized crossover trial with no washout period. Participants received Plant and Animal products, dietary counseling, lab assessments, microbiome assessments (16S), and anthropometric measurements. Participants were instructed to consume \u22652 servings/d of Plant compared with Animal for 8 wk each, while keeping all other foods and beverages as similar as possible between the 2 phases.\n\nResults\nThe 36 participants who provided complete data for both crossover phases included 67% women, were 69% Caucasian, had a mean \u00b1 SD age 50 \u00b1 14 y, and BMI 28 \u00b1 5 kg/m2. Mean \u00b1 SD servings per day were not different by intervention sequence: 2.5 \u00b1 0.6 compared with 2.6 \u00b1 0.7 for Plant and Animal, respectively (P = 0.76). Mean \u00b1 SEM TMAO concentrations were significantly lower overall for Plant (2.7 \u00b1 0.3) than for Animal (4.7 \u00b1 0.9) (P = 0.012), but a significant order effect was observed (P = 0.023). TMAO concentrations were significantly lower for Plant among the n = 18 who received Plant second (2.9 \u00b1 0.4 compared with 6.4 \u00b1 1.5, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.007), but not for the n = 18 who received Plant first (2.5 \u00b1 0.4 compared with 3.0 \u00b1 0.6, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.23). Exploratory analyses of the microbiome failed to reveal possible responder compared with nonresponder factors. Mean \u00b1 SEM LDL-cholesterol concentrations (109.9 \u00b1 4.5 compared with 120.7 \u00b1 4.5 mg/dL, P = 0.002) and weight (78.7 \u00b1 3.0 compared with 79.6 \u00b1 3.0 kg, P < 0.001) were lower during the Plant phase.\n\nConclusions\nAmong generally healthy adults, contrasting Plant with Animal intake, while keeping all other dietary components similar, the Plant products improved several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including TMAO; there were no adverse effects on risk factors from the Plant products.\u201d\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/ajcn/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa203/5890315?redirectedFrom=fulltext", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/i8ifwo/a_randomized_crossover_trial_on_the_effect_of/", "created_utc": 1597254573.0, "score": 190, "author": "Only8livesleft", "num_comments": 97, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/i8ifwo/a_randomized_crossover_trial_on_the_effect_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

That's fine and is ideal for participants here to throw back and forth. It's another thing altogether when someone is wholly anti-science.  We're not talking about cases of \"is this a 6 or a 9\", we're talking about cases of \"there are no numbers\"\n\nScience is real.  Science is necessary.  This sub is for and about the science of nutrition. While it is not the subreddit's place to enforce a side in disagreements over interpretations of data / studies / research, we feel it is incumbent upon us to address anti-science narratives. \n\nIt is not informative, helpful, or productive when someone comes to this sub and is not engaging in facts, is utterly resistant to providing any facts, is solely reliant on youtube videos as a basis for their claims, and ultimately responds to any debate with conspiracy claims.   A completely fact resistant mindset based on gut feelings and \"somebody dun sed an I dont care who\" is not engaging in good faith whatsoever.\n\nWhile we sympathize with concerns about corporate interests, it is a problem when folks are coming here to specifically bash any and all science and try to discredit every bit of it with \"funding bias\" and \"Big food and Big pharma\" kinds of comments. THE biggest problem misinformation angle in the nutrition sub are science rejection comments, and not just rejection of some specific thing but those which are actively promoting \"don't trust any science\". \n\nAgain, the science of any specific facet of nutrition is always welcomed to be debated here, it's part of the purpose of the sub, but a debate of the validity of science itself is not.\n\nTherefore, going forward;\n\n* **\"Science is a conspiracy\" type engagement is not allowed** - If instead of having a fact based discussion, your purpose here is to engage solely in unsubstantiated conspiracy generalizations and science denial, then you are likely to be banned. If conspiracy claims are your basis for discussion or you wish to question science itself, then you should instead utilize the subreddits which cater to those discussions as it is not on topic for this sub.\n\n* **Automod will be removing certain kinds of anti-science and conspiracy comments**.  This will be very targeted to science denial rhetoric so as to ensure appropriate topical debate is left in place.\n\n* **Any bias concerns need to be *specifically* addressed and cited rather than barfing up generalized funding bias hyperbole**. Pointing out a specific company or companies behind a specific study to express concerns about bias is more than acceptable for discussion here.  Blanket brushing all science / research / studies ever generated for funding bias is ridiculous conspiracy blather and is outside of reality.  It's a step way too far.\n\nIn addition to the above, we also ask you to vote accordingly and to let us know when you see\n\n\"all science BAD!\"  \n\"all studies are a conspiracy and are biased!\"  \n\"everything is a conspiracy!\"  \n\"I aint gunna cite anything CUZ youtube SED I'z RIGHT!\"  \n\nIf you have any on topic questions, please ask here\n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/pcrwjw/rnutrition_sub_update_addressing_antiscience/", "created_utc": 1630085218.0, "score": 186, "author": "soundeziner", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/pcrwjw/rnutrition_sub_update_addressing_antiscience/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

However, researchers found that diets higher in high-quality plant protein sources such as legumes, soy, and nuts resulted in lower levels of both total and LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol compared to diets with red meat.\n\nThe results are consistent with long-term epidemiologic studies showing lower risks of heart attacks when nuts and other plant sources of protein are compared to red meat, the authors said. The findings also suggest that the inconsistencies found in prior studies regarding the effects of red meat on cardiovascular risk factors may be due, in part, to the composition of the comparison diet. They recommended that future studies take specific comparisons into account...\n\nThe authors recommended adherence to healthy vegetarian and Mediterranean-style diets, both for their health benefits and to promote environmental sustainability.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/substituting-healthy-plant-proteins-for-red-meat-lowers-risk-for-heart-disease/\n\nhttps://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035225", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/bisrrk/metaanalysis_of_rcts_finds_substituting_healthy/", "created_utc": 1556561848.0, "score": 181, "author": "Only8livesleft", "num_comments": 150, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/bisrrk/metaanalysis_of_rcts_finds_substituting_healthy/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Fruit is nutritious, contains fiber and has not been correlated with cardiovascular disease! Eat your fruit! In fact even carbohydrates are good as long as you don't eat too many refined carbohydrates! He isn't saying carbs are bad, he's essentially saying refined sugars like candy and soda is bad. Don't take any facts in the title or the following body of text as fact until you've watched the video! Or ignore it altogether, up to you.\n\nHe goes into the data on the correlation between high fructose low fat diets and obesity, why fiber is good, why and how people are getting sick using the standard American diet. He also explains the biochemistry on how fructose is processed in the liver the same as ethanol. The USDA essentially regulates acute poisons and ignores chronic poisons such as fructose.\n\nTo many of us, this is not new, but this one and a half hour long presentation from Robert H. Lustig, Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology, is a very refreshing bit of footage to watch and remind us that while it's easy to eat the wrong food, it's actually also very easy to eat the right food.\n\nWe have the answers to the obesity and cardiovascular disease epidemic but so many people are not exposed to these answers and we need to all help make the right information available to everyone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/jp2lvs/fructose_is_the_same_as_ethanol_an_but_old/", "created_utc": 1604657306.0, "score": 176, "author": "Etzello", "num_comments": 72, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/jp2lvs/fructose_is_the_same_as_ethanol_an_but_old/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Are these carbs in anyway better than fiber, complex carbs or even simple carbs?\n\n\n**They're filled with vitamins, potassium and fiber-** Yes, but again many vegetables contain far more nutrition per serving without the sugar. And even then, besides vitamin C you're not getting that much of the above.\n\n\n**They're high in antioxidants-** Isn't that just specific types of vitamins/minerals? If so, see above.\n\n\nSo what am I missing here? Is this natural sugar any better than other carbs besides processed sugar? Is there something in fruits that is usually not on the nutrition facts label?\n\n\nEDIT: Just in case anyone googling this topic finds this post, I want to point out that eating an excessive amount of high fructose/glucose fruits in one setting has been shown to increase blood sugar in non-diabetics after the meal and to excessive amounts for diabetics. I did not find any studies proving that long term diets of eating an excessive amount of fruits being unhealthy for non-diabetics. I would also like to point out that there have been studies showing that non-diabetics eating fruits in addition to sugary snacks had **lower** blood sugar afterwards than people eating **only** the same amount of the sugary snacks. At the very least, if you plan on eating something sugary you may want to add some fruits to the meal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/jh1ls2/should_we_skip_fruits_and_eat_more_vegetables/", "created_utc": 1603508734.0, "score": 167, "author": "Exocentric", "num_comments": 247, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/jh1ls2/should_we_skip_fruits_and_eat_more_vegetables/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Low cholesterol and mental health problems", "selftext": "This seems to be a topic rarely discussed so I thought a thread would be a good idea.\n\nHere's the Psychology Today's [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201803/low-cholesterol-and-suicide-again) on low cholesterol and suicide:\n\n>Despite these reasonable suppositions,\u00a0many studies over decades have (for the most part) consistently linked low total serum cholesterol with suicide, violence, and depression. Total cholesterol levels below 160, and especially below 130, correlate with a\u00a0higher risk of mental problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Those with hypocholesterolemia were over *four times*\u00a0more likely to have major depressive disorder, and over *five times*\u00a0more likely to have attempted suicide. In fact, half the suicide attempters had a total cholesterol of less than 150\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Specifically, lower cholesterol seems to directly impair the function of the 5HT-1A receptor, the most common\u00a0serotonin receptor in the brain. Activators of this receptor tend to decrease anxiety,  among other downstream effects relating to many other neurotransmitters  that can affect depression and neuron recovery and repair.\u00a0Low  serotonin activity in the central nervous system  has long been known to correlate with violence and suicide. This means  that cholesterol depletion in the brain could plausibly lead to poor  serotonin signaling and subsequent increased risk of suicidal behaviors.\n\nAnd here's a [summary](https://veganhealth.org/cardiovascular-disease-markers-in-vegans/) of studies analyzing vegan cholesterol levels:\n\n>Between 1980 and 2002, cholesterol levels of vegans living in Western  countries was measured in 17 studies. The average cholesterol level of  vegans was 160 compared to 202 mg/dl for non-vegetarians. Table 2 shows  the results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Of the 17 studies in Table 2, five were of vegans living in the USA.  Of those studies, the lowest average finding for total cholesterol for  vegans was 135 mg/dl. The data from all 5 studies is compiled in Table  3. The total cholesterol of the 135 vegans averaged out to 146 mg/dl.\n\nAnd here is the mortality [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657045) from U.K (n=60k) which showed that in the vegetarian and vegan diet groups there was a higher risk of dying from mental health related causes than in the other groups studied which were regular meat eaters, low meat eaters and fish eaters. The specific part of the study is [here](https://i.imgur.com/MQWJCrC.jpg). \n\nIs it fair to say that diet that decreases your cholesterol levels also puts you at the risk for depression and other mental health problems?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/ggi94b/low_cholesterol_and_mental_health_problems/", "created_utc": 1589041060.0, "score": 166, "author": "carnivalcrash", "num_comments": 88, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/ggi94b/low_cholesterol_and_mental_health_problems/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Fully read any response you receive from a mod, including automoderator, before messaging for an appeal.***\n\n**1) [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) is required** - Avoid flame wars and vote complaining. Trolling, insults, brigading, or antagonism towards the subreddit participants, the moderators, or even the community itself may also result in a ban. Instead of bashing, share sources, citations, and studies, as well as accept when your positions are going to differ. Walk away if something angers you.\n\n**2) No dietary activism for or against any diet** - Diet wars are NOT welcome here. Crusading is usually off topic and often intended to be inflammatory. Participants in this subreddit have a variety of dietary requirements, beliefs, body types, and goals. Being a diet fan is fine.  Being a jerk fan or jerk anti-fan of a diet is not okay and will result in a ban.  **DO NOT**;\n\n* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets/beliefs** - Be informative without being rude. Talk TO them, not ABOUT the other person / group,\n* **engage in diet or food shaming** \n* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**\n* **promote or argue ethics and morals** \n* **promote diet absolutism** - no diet is the *only* healthy one.  You CAN say \"this is best for me\" and explain why and what it emphasizes\n* **make specious cure claims** - chronic disease cure claims are not allowed.  Saying it \"can control the symptoms of\" is fine if that is the case\n* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - avoid doing it to this or any other subreddit or the posts therein\n* **bias whine** - is not helpful. \"I'm downvoted because I eat (name diet)\" is just shit stirring and trying to play martyr\n* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - talk about your favorite diet but only advertise the sub for it in no more than 1/10 of your activity\n\n**3) No all science rejection or 'all science is a conspiracy' claims** - whole science rejectionist type of engagement is not grounded in reality or facts and therefore is not allowed. Conspiracy, bias, and funding complaints need to provide sources addressing the *specifics* of a situation being discussed rather than barfing up all encompassing unsubstantiated generalizations, hyperbole, and 'everybody knows' kinds of statements, none of which are grounded in science. Refer to [the announcement post about this rule](https://redd.it/pcrwjw) for more info.\n\n**4) No requesting or providing medical concern advice** - these problem posts involve discussion of a disease, condition, pain, diagnosis, procedure, test, recovery, consultation with a health professional, or lab value.  You can ask how nutrition impacts humans in general but you may not ask for advice about treating or managing a medical conditions or how a nutritional choice would impact your specific medial condition (or a family member).  *All medical questions should be directed to a physician, dietitian, or other qualified and licensed health care provider who has access to your personal medical records.* It is dangerous to solicit medical advice on an internet forum. It is also illegal in most cases and against health care codes of ethics for users to provide it to you in this forum.\n\n**5) No personalized nutrition inquiry posts. Instead ask in the comments section of the** **[/r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2)** - If your post contains *ANY* personal context (it pertains to you, your diet, your family member(s) or anyone within your sphere) and/or a diet evaluation request (something you or someone in your life ate, are eating, or thinking about consuming), *it will be removed*, no exceptions. **Trying to end run this rule, pretending it is unclear, or making any kind of baseless, false, disingenuous, or entitlement based appeals will result in a ban.**\n\n**6) No blogspam and/or self-promotion** - Any form of linking, referencing, or mentioning of things you are affiliated with will be removed and likely result in a ban. This applies to your sites, videos, media channels, books, articles, surveys, etc.  The sub is here to talk about nutrition science, not what you've created. Do not try to use the sub to drive traffic to something you are involved with, even if it is free.  IRB approved surveys may be approved if a request is sent to the moderators.\n\n**7) All links must be direct links** - The reddit site filter removes uses of link shorteners.  Use a direct URL instead. Submissions of links using link tracking services will lead to an instant ban.\n\n**8) No posts from brand new accounts and negative karma accounts** - Brand new accounts may not make new posts in this subreddit.  However, you can comment on other posts while you get to know the site and subreddit. Negative karma accounts cannot post or comment here.\n\n\n# Suggestions\n\nThese suggestions are offered to improve your experience in the subreddit.\n\n* Refrain from a \"once-size-fits-all\" stance regarding nutrition.  Accept that there are other approaches which you may not agree with, other body types, and a variety of goals and circumstances.\n\n* Include proper, relevant, and useful information when asking or answering questions.  Provide links to studies, articles, research, papers, etc. when offering your viewpoint.  Need to find the evidence? Check out [**PubMed**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) or [**Google Scholar**](http://www.scholar.google.com).  \n\n* It may be FAQ. If you have a question, [**search**](http://www.reddit.com/help/search) before you post or take a look at this [**FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/wiki/faq#/c/purple/) wiki page\n\n* Report posts and comments which violate site or subreddit rules. Don\u2019t report comments and posts over disagreement. It is a waste of your time since it achieves nothing and it puts your account at risk since report abuse is a site infraction.\n\n\n# User Flair\n\nYou can set your user flair to indicate your level of nutrition expertise/education. Do not select a user flair you are not qualified for. Anyone who is not able to verify their user flair status when asked to do so may be banned.\n\n---\n\n# Moderators Needed\n\nThis sub continues to rapidly grow, therefore so does our need to expand the moderation team. We are looking to add several experienced Reddit users who have a passion for nutrition and a desire to help curate [/r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) as a collegial space for informative nutrition discussions.\n\nHere is what we are looking for from applicants.

Let us know whether you mod any other subs and if you have any relevant experience like moderating other forums/pages, using back-end web tools, etc.\n4. Mods need to be frequent Reddit users. The ideal mod is someone who pops into Reddit multiple times per day, can devote some time to addressing moderator issues when logging on, and foresees continuing to do so in the future.\n5. You should be a team player who is on board with following processes and procedures including using communications channels so that we stay on the same page and present a united and consistent front that prioritizes [r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) and its core users.\n6. You should be someone who is comfortable enforcing rules and able to handle receiving harsh/critical feedback from strangers on the internet without breaking down, losing your temper, or giving in.\n\nIf you are interested in applying, please [message the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition) with *a note which addresses all the points above (please use numbering)*. Do not leave your application as a comment here.\n\n---\n\nAs always, the moderation team is open to your thoughts and ideas on the subreddit.

The Donation\n\nIn 1948, Procter & Gamble donated $1.5 million (equivalent to tens of millions today) to the American Heart Association.\nThis donation came from radio show profits generated by P&G\u2019s soap brand Crisco, which was the first hydrogenated vegetable oil (rich in trans fats).\n2. Result\n\nThat donation transformed AHA from a small cardiology group into a national health organization.\nWith more visibility and funding, the AHA started to issue national guidelines on heart disease prevention \u2014 eventually recommending reducing saturated fat (from animal sources) and replacing it with polyunsaturated fats (like those in vegetable oils).\nWhy It Matters\nCrisco and other P&G products were based on hydrogenated oils, later found to contain trans fats, which we now know are much more harmful than saturated fat.\nWhile P&G didn\u2019t directly write AHA\u2019s recommendations, their funding likely helped shape the environment in which saturated fat became the focus \u2014 and industrial seed oils were promoted as \u201cheart-healthy.\u201d\nSo, Did P&G Influence Dietary Guidelines?\nIndirectly, yes.

The Donation\n\nIn 1948, Procter & Gamble donated $1.5 million (equivalent to tens of millions today) to the American Heart Association.\nThis donation came from radio show profits generated by P&G\u2019s soap brand Crisco, which was the first hydrogenated vegetable oil (rich in trans fats).\n2. Result\n\nThat donation transformed AHA from a small cardiology group into a national health organization.\nWith more visibility and funding, the AHA started to issue national guidelines on heart disease prevention \u2014 eventually recommending reducing saturated fat (from animal sources) and replacing it with polyunsaturated fats (like those in vegetable oils).\nWhy It Matters\nCrisco and other P&G products were based on hydrogenated oils, later found to contain trans fats, which we now know are much more harmful than saturated fat.\nWhile P&G didn\u2019t directly write AHA\u2019s recommendations, their funding likely helped shape the environment in which saturated fat became the focus \u2014 and industrial seed oils were promoted as \u201cheart-healthy.\u201d\nSo, Did P&G Influence Dietary Guidelines?\nIndirectly, yes.

Those cheeses will knock your socks off in terms of flavor and 28g would be a reasonable amount to identify all the tasting notes. The flavours of these cheeses are also extremely strong and a small 28g serving would last quite a while because you can only eat a tiny amount of cheese per bite.

I used a dry rub and sauce, but calorie counted them separately.\n\nAfter eating, I weighed the bones which were 178g, giving me a net weight of 462g\n\nMy fitness Pal says 220 calories per 100g, which means my 6 wings come to 1016 calories without the rub and sauce which seems....too high?\n\nCan anyone let me know if im right to think this is too high, or whether infact 6 wings without rub and sauce is 1000+ calories?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1jrgsn9/calorie_counting_chicken_wings/", "created_utc": 1743785821.0, "score": 0, "author": "Commercial-Canary-99", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/nutrition/comments/1jrgsn9/calorie_counting_chicken_wings/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Fitbit vs MyFitnessPal for logging meals and tracking macros", "selftext": "I'm looking for some advice and to hear about your experiences with logging food and tracking macronutrients. I've been trying to get more serious about my nutrition lately, but finding the right tracking method has been a bit of a struggle.\n\nI've primarily used two apps:\n * Fitbit Premium: Since I'm on a Pixel phone, the integration is pretty seamless, and I like being able to see my activity and sleep data alongside my food log. \n\nHowever, the food database feels less comprehensive than others, and the macro tracking is very basic \u2013 it shows you the percentages, but there's no way to set specific macro targets and see how you're doing against them throughout the day. \n\nThis is a big limitation for me.\n * MyFitnessPal: This seems to have the largest and most accurate food database out there, which is a huge plus. The macro tracking is also much more robust, allowing you to set specific goals. However, the cost of the premium version (which seems necessary for truly effective macro tracking) feels a bit steep.\n\nSo, I'm at a bit of a crossroads and looking for your insights!\n\nMy questions for you:\n * What are your favorite apps or methods for logging food and tracking macros? Are there any hidden gems I should consider?\n * If you've used both Fitbit and MFP, what were your experiences? Did you find a way to make either work well for strict macro tracking without breaking the bank?\n * Are there any good free alternatives to MFP that offer decent macro tracking and a reasonably sized food database?\n * For those on a Pixel device, have you found any clever ways to work around Fitbit's limited macro tracking? Maybe a separate app you use in conjunction?\n * Any general tips or tricks for staying consistent with food logging and macro tracking?\n\nI'm open to any and all suggestions!

I compared it to the nutritional label and the first one was indeed lower calorie, but they both claim to be 17% fat.   \n  \nTo make it more confusing, there was also a brand that was \"light\" coconut milk and it consisted of a lower fat percentage, lower calories, but had a higher coconut extract (55%)/water ratio than the full fat one.

This sub sees multiple protein-based questions every week, the number of protein-fortified food products has soared, influencers are drinking chicken smoothies, etc.\n\nOne topic that I am surprised rarely comes up (and yes, I searched the sub history and found pretty much nothing) is the exclusivity of protein utilization as a building block vs as a fuel source. \n\nEverywhere you look you will see calories attributed to protein. This makes sense because proteins can be used to generate energy. It's 4ish calories per gram (although utilization is inefficient per TEF and the real output may only be 3ish calories per gram). This is why the calories for e.g. a 82g chicken breast is listed as 128, 104 of which come from 26g of protein. \n\nThe problem with this common understanding is that our bodies need to use an amount newly-digested amino acids every day to replace degraded ones or to grow. We can recycle some, but not everything. And an amino acid cannot simultaneously be used to build a protein AND be deaminated for energy. It's either one or the other. \n\nOf course, the body's choice to use an amino acid for one purpose or another is quite complicated. The common way to talk about it is to say that the body prefers carbs and fats for energy and won't turn to protein for calories unless it runs out of the other two. However, if you consume more protein than necessary the excess will be used for energy (yes, that energy will be stored as fat in excess), and there is probably some protein metabolism happening at all times. \n\nBut we know there must be some amount of protein that does not enter our energy system at all because it gets used as building blocks for other stuff. The entire reason protein is tending today is because of all the non-caloric benefits of protein - we're not drinking protein shakes because we need the calories. \n\nLet's say a typical person has a TDEE of 2000 kcal and also needs 50g of protein for basic maintenance. If such a person were to eat 2200 calories per nutrition labels, including 100g protein, it would appear that person consumed an excess of 200 calories. Do that every day and the math suggests that person will gain 20ish pounds of fat in a year - that's a lot! But if 50g of protein is being used as building blocks to repair muscle, build hormones, etc, then that person is not consuming excess calories at all. They will not gain any weight. \n\nGiven the obsession with calorie counting, protein macro counting, etc, it puzzles me that we don't have common estimates for protein utilization. There are endless debates about how much protein we should eat, but no one is saying \"the first Xg of protein provide zero calories.\" \n\nI can imagine a few possible reasons for this:\n\n1 - This level of analysis doesn't boil down to easy advice (like eat Xg protein per day), so no one bothers.\n\n2 - Somehow our bodies really can have their cake and eat it too when it comes to amino acids. \n\n3 - Utilization is actually quite a small percentage of protein consumed, such that it is negligible. Maybe we're only using 5g per day, and if we want to induce our bodies to use an extra gram we have to eat 20-30 grams. \n\n4 - no one has thought of it before (probably not).\n\nSo what is really going on here?

I am trying to find a way (ideally in app form but if I must then I will make a spreadsheet or notebook log). My goal right now is to track all of my macros and micros on a daily basis to the best, reasonable accuracy. With this being said, I know certain vitamins and minerals need other substances to even be absorbed (and I don't think just pissing them out counts as taking it)\n\n**Goal**: I am currently doing a keto diet (second time) and want to collect data of nutritional trends, what deficiencies are occurring and how to best combat these while remaining in a state of ketosis. I took a similar approach the first time I tried this diet about 8 or so years ago. My recollection from that experience was overall positive. I was more focused on weight so I tracked macro intake, inches on various body parts, weight fluctuations, things of that sort without regard to what nutrients I may or may not have been lacking. **Previous Result:** I lost 40 lbs, gained some muscle mass, developed a better sleep cycle, more energy upon waking up and an improved level of brain functioning so much so I was able to stop taking my A.D.D. meds.\n\n\n\n**New Goal**: Obviously I would like to get more physically fit but this time around the focus is on my mental function. The data I want to collect is over a 6 month period (currently 1.5 months in, and realizing the importance of tracking more than what Fitbit tracks so if I can get a better grasp of what variables I need to include I may just start over, or use the currently collected data as a comparison). \n\n**What I am asking for help with**: I took a nutrition course in college ages ago so I know certain vitamins (such as vitamin D) need fats for absorption (hence adding it to milk products). I've forgotten everything else unfortunately. I keep trying to look online and am struggling to create a comprehensive list of what vitamins and minerals are needed alongside what they each require for proper absorption and utilization. \n\nCan someone possible provide a simplified chart/graph/anything that can show the body's needs and the mechanisms required to use them? I know it is asking a lot but I am hoping there is someone else here that loves looking at data and might have either already made something similar themselves or can point me in the right direction so I am not just surfing the web for hours and getting lost on conflicting information.\n\n  \nThank you in advance for anyone who responds to this!

Here are a few questions to kick off the conversation:\n\n* How is your daily routine when it comes to eating healthy? Have you found it challenging to discover recipes or ingredients that you really love?\n* What motivates you to buy organic or bulk products, and where do you usually go when looking for them?\n* Would you like to learn more about nutrition or healthy cooking? Have you ever attended a workshop or talk on the subject? What did you think of it?\n* When you shop, what makes you feel that you're in a place that truly cares for you and earns your trust? (For example, a great atmosphere, personalized attention, recipe ideas, etc.)\n* What kind of promotions or discounts would encourage you to return to a place that offers healthy products?
