When I pulled them out recently (I know; I should have done it right away, but life...), I tasted one and OMG... it was NOTHING like the pathetic dried basil sold in the spice section. These were vibrant and tasted just like the fresh Basil leaves smelled... scrumptious.\n* Then yesterday I had a big container of mushrooms... again way more than I'd be able to get through myself. I hand washed the tops and cut them roughly because I didn't have much time to process them. Threw them into the dehydrator on multiple wire shelves. I set it for 16 hours at 140F. After 9 hours or so I checked them. They are nicely dried and crunchy. Then I tasted one. WOW... again nothing like dried mushrooms I've bought.

The amount of salt and sugar is completely adjustable to individual needs. Only a small amount is needed to season most meats so it cuts way down on sodium.\n\nThe dehydration part:\nDehydrating plain red sweet peppers, turmeric, garlic and onions are so much tastier than using regular produce.

The top of the pineapples are not fully ripe and the bottoms are over ripe, so the unripe part takes less time to dry and the over ripe part that has more sugars in i takes longer  - so as I am condensing them I am also pick out the ones that are already dried from needing less time because they where cut thinner or it is more of the top pineapple that is not as ripe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if you are dipping fruit in lemons, what type are you doing it with?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dehydrating/comments/u0hs5i/dipping_fruit_in_lemons/", "created_utc": 1649597929.0, "score": 49, "author": "CRTom", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/dehydrating/comments/u0hs5i/dipping_fruit_in_lemons/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sun Dried Tomatoes", "selftext": "I was watching a video on making sun dried tomatoes in Italy using only some screen covered racks and set out in the sun for days.  I thought about this and wondered how I 've gotten along as a full time motorhome dweller and not thought of natural dehydrating before.   \n  \nI happened to find this group but I see nobody was doing what I wanted to do. Everyone was using electric dehydrators and stuff of the such. Why, I asked myself. Why not use the sun like people have been doing for millenia.   \n  \nI thought about using those hanging mesh things but those all stated that they were for drying herbs. While I may be doing that as well there's other things I want to dehydrate such as tomato's, pineapple, and other fruits. Maybe some jerky as well. After a bit of googling, now called researching,  I found some cooling racks for things like cookies. That'll work I thought and I ordered a set of 3. Then I went to Home Depot and got some screening and window screen framing. A reasonable idea but once the screen was put into the frame, the frame twisted and was hard to assemble into a box. Scrap that idea. Plan B was to make a haphazard frame out of scrap wood and cover it with some mosquito netting. So far so good. I cut up what seemed like a hundred Roma tomato's and took them up to the roof with the frame, racks, and netting. Then the netting got laid down, the racks of tomato's set down and the framing. I folded the netting so everything was closed up and secured the opening with a big binder clip. After three days in the hot Arizona sun they're almost completely dry. Since I don't want to have to store them in jugs of spiced oil, I'll toss them into a bag. I'll try rehydrating them when needed. It should work with no bacteria issues since they're so dry. If I have to toss a bit of vinegar in while rehydrating then that's OK.\n\nThe cost of the racks was about $16 off Amazon for a set of three, the netting about $7 at Ace Hardware, the tomato's were at the going price but I'll look at sourcing from area farms The bits of wood were free and I did but a big rock on top of the frame because the wind does get up around 11mph on a normal day. This is a very doable low cost way of dehydrating. The goal is to have all kinds of stuff dehydrated naturally by the sun for weight reduction, space savings, and later use( I make a lot of soups).\n\nMeats I'm on the fence about. I've made my own Elk jerky before and though it wasn't made to certain temperatures for a certain length of time, it was tasty, smoked, and I'm still alive. Native Americans have been eating Pemmican and jerky since there were meats so again, it's very doable.

Archaeologists have used historical and ethnographic sources to discover how ch'arki was made, and from that developed a theory about what archaeological remains can be expected from that process. The earliest written record we have comes from the Spanish friar and conquistador Bernab\u00e9 Cobo. Writing in 1653, Cobo wrote that Peruvian people prepared ch'arki by cutting it into slices, putting the slices on ice for a time and then pounding it thin.  \n>  \n>More recent information from modern day butchers in Cuzco support this method. They make strips of deboned meat of uniform thickness, no more than 5 mm (1 inch), to control the consistency and timing of the drying process. These strips are exposed to the elements in high altitudes during the driest and coldest months between May and August. There the strips are hung on lines, specially constructed poles, or simply placed on rooftops to keep them out of reach of scavenging animals. After between 4-5 (or as many as 25 days, recipes vary), the strips are removed from the are pounded between two stones to make them thinner still.  \n>  \n>Ch'arki is made by different methods in different parts of South America: for example, in Bolivia, what is called ch'arki is dried meat with fragments of foot and skulls left, and in the Ayucucho region, meat simply dried on the bone is called ch'arki. Meat dried at higher elevations can be done with cold temperatures alone; meat dried at lower elevations is done by smoking or salting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dehydrating/comments/fste3h/the_origins_of_jerky_lie_in_the_early_andean/", "created_utc": 1585718563.0, "score": 40, "author": "Wordie", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/dehydrating/comments/fste3h/the_origins_of_jerky_lie_in_the_early_andean/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sauce made from dehydrated tomato", "selftext": "I just made a sauce from dehydrated tomatoes and it is incredible. It takes on the form of tomato sauce but maintains the flavor that sun dried tomatoes have. I'm surprised restaurants dont do this because it seems like a wonderful way to level up a tomato sauce into something a little more special and fancy, and its also much easier for storage. Not to mention how cost effective!\nFor comparison, usually I make tomato sauce with canned tomatoes that are 1,85\u20ac per kg and the fresh pear tomatoes at my supermarket are actually 1,19\u20ac per kg, so quite a bit cheaper. It's also convenient because if I make a smaller portion of sauce I'm not left with an opened can of tomatoes in the fridge. When I dried the tomatoes I was able to fit about 3.5 kg of fresh tomatoes into my dehydrator at once (my dehydrator has 6 trays)\n\nFor one portion of sauce I used 20gr of dried tomatoes and mixed it with 100ml of water (I ended up adding more water while cooking because it reduced quite fast, just have a look how thick you like your sauce to be and add water accordingly, adding water from the pasta will make it creamier too) I didn't let it soak, but just added it straight to the hot pan that already had onion and minced meat frying in it. And then I let it cook for about 5 minutes while my pasta boiled \nAlso added some herbs to it and salt and pepper of course.

I hadn\u2019t thought dehydrating oranges would be good as a snack They were sugared, but totally chewy and delicious so I figured, why not give it a try?\n\n\nI bought a bag of clementines and tried three different versions. All were dried on my Presto for 16 hours at 135 with the following results:\n\n\n1. Plain- here I just peeled the orange and put the segments on a tray. The membrane turned out crunchy, almost like a chip. Then the inners have a decent chew, but it\u2019s a very small nugget of orange meat in a white crunchy shell.\n\n\n2. Dipped in simple syrup. Not rinsed. These shrunk uniformly, so no outer crunchy \u2018paper\u2019. The outsides have a little glaze from the sugar that is tasty. The insides are better and the whole section is a somewhat chewy bite.\n\n\n3. Soaked in syrup for 15 minutes then rinsed before drying. I think these are my favorite so far. They dried like the ones that had been dipped, so no crunchy outer. For some reason they made the best little dried nugget, but still nowhere near as good as Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n1. Do you think there\u2019s a structural difference between mandarins and clementines that makes the store bought ones so good? I was thinking of trying a can of mandarins in syrup as an experiment.\n\n\n2 in the meantime, I have 5 pounds of clementines to use up.

Wash, cut, place on a wire rack in the sun, cover with garden netting and wait. That took about four days or so of sunshine. To know when they're dried, taste one.  \n  \nThis time I used sliced Pineapple rings that were canned in natural juice. All I had to do was open the can, pour the Pineapple juice in a big jar, place the slices on the racks on the roof of the motorhome, cover with garden netting and wait about two and a half days. The pineapple has turned to a nice golden hue and is dried, chewy, and very tasty. I specifically bought the slices canned in natural juices because I don't want any refined sugar on my foods.   \nEach can of slices weighs 20 ounces and my three stainless steel cookie drying racks holds six cans of slices. After several days of sun drying, the yield is about 10.8 ounces of dried Pineapple slices. 120 oz in and almost 11 0z out.

{"title": "Sun Dried Tomatoes", "selftext": "I was watching a video on making sun dried tomatoes in Italy using only some screen covered racks and set out in the sun for days.  I thought about this and wondered how I 've gotten along as a full time motorhome dweller and not thought of natural dehydrating before.   \n  \nI happened to find this group but I see nobody was doing what I wanted to do. Everyone was using electric dehydrators and stuff of the such. Why, I asked myself. Why not use the sun like people have been doing for millenia.   \n  \nI thought about using those hanging mesh things but those all stated that they were for drying herbs. While I may be doing that as well there's other things I want to dehydrate such as tomato's, pineapple, and other fruits. Maybe some jerky as well. After a bit of googling, now called researching,  I found some cooling racks for things like cookies. That'll work I thought and I ordered a set of 3. Then I went to Home Depot and got some screening and window screen framing. A reasonable idea but once the screen was put into the frame, the frame twisted and was hard to assemble into a box. Scrap that idea. Plan B was to make a haphazard frame out of scrap wood and cover it with some mosquito netting. So far so good. I cut up what seemed like a hundred Roma tomato's and took them up to the roof with the frame, racks, and netting. Then the netting got laid down, the racks of tomato's set down and the framing. I folded the netting so everything was closed up and secured the opening with a big binder clip. After three days in the hot Arizona sun they're almost completely dry. Since I don't want to have to store them in jugs of spiced oil, I'll toss them into a bag. I'll try rehydrating them when needed. It should work with no bacteria issues since they're so dry. If I have to toss a bit of vinegar in while rehydrating then that's OK.\n\nThe cost of the racks was about $16 off Amazon for a set of three, the netting about $7 at Ace Hardware, the tomato's were at the going price but I'll look at sourcing from area farms The bits of wood were free and I did but a big rock on top of the frame because the wind does get up around 11mph on a normal day. This is a very doable low cost way of dehydrating. The goal is to have all kinds of stuff dehydrated naturally by the sun for weight reduction, space savings, and later use( I make a lot of soups).\n\nMeats I'm on the fence about. I've made my own Elk jerky before and though it wasn't made to certain temperatures for a certain length of time, it was tasty, smoked, and I'm still alive. Native Americans have been eating Pemmican and jerky since there were meats so again, it's very doable.

I know organ meats are super nutritious, and my pup goes absolutely crazy for them!\n\nFrom what I understand, there are two ways to prepare them:\n\n1. **Slice and dehydrate raw**\n2. **Cook first, then slice and dehydrate**\n\nI\u2019m wondering\u2014what\u2019s the difference between the two methods?

I\u2019ve done the same with beef kidney, chicken, and turkey gizzards. He can eat these non-stop without any tummy troubles.\n\nI don\u2019t know all the science behind it, but in simple terms\u2014does cooking help with digestion? Am I losing too many nutrients in the process? And does the dehydration temp matter (e.g., 120\u00b0F for longer vs. 140\u00b0F for shorter)?

{"title": "Excalibur quality control disappointments", "selftext": "Mid-December, as a treat to myself, I decided to upgrade my 15 year old, tiny bottom-heater donut dehydrator and bought a 5-tray Excalibur online, which said it would come with 4 silicone mats. \n\n\nRight before New Years, I received the package. It had a unit with glued-down but broken trim that drew blood, and no silicone mats. It was also at least 4x louder than I'd hoped, perhaps bc it didn't seem assembled quite properly. I started an email process that set up a replacement and a shipment of silicone mats.\n\n\nA week and a half later, I got a unit that seemed functional. A day after that, I got one silicone mat.\n\n\nI began using the dehydrator, and once I tightened a loose screw, it was only twice as loud as I'd hoped. But I could see flashing when I looked at the back panel. Looking inside, I saw a yo-yo shaped part that was sparking steadily along the middle bit. I searched this sub, and this sparking issue has been mentioned. It got a mixture of comments saying it was either a significant problem, or just the way the thermostat in it works. I sent a video to the company to get clarification, and they are now sending me a label to return this one for yet another replacement unit. Still no last 3 mats.\n\n\nI'm just so frustrated. This is one of the few times I've spent money on myself in years and it just keeps failing. Idek if the third machine will function properly.

It takes on the form of tomato sauce but maintains the flavor that sun dried tomatoes have. I'm surprised restaurants dont do this because it seems like a wonderful way to level up a tomato sauce into something a little more special and fancy, and its also much easier for storage. Not to mention how cost effective!\nFor comparison, usually I make tomato sauce with canned tomatoes that are 1,85\u20ac per kg and the fresh pear tomatoes at my supermarket are actually 1,19\u20ac per kg, so quite a bit cheaper. It's also convenient because if I make a smaller portion of sauce I'm not left with an opened can of tomatoes in the fridge. When I dried the tomatoes I was able to fit about 3.5 kg of fresh tomatoes into my dehydrator at once (my dehydrator has 6 trays)\n\nFor one portion of sauce I used 20gr of dried tomatoes and mixed it with 100ml of water (I ended up adding more water while cooking because it reduced quite fast, just have a look how thick you like your sauce to be and add water accordingly, adding water from the pasta will make it creamier too) I didn't let it soak, but just added it straight to the hot pan that already had onion and minced meat frying in it. And then I let it cook for about 5 minutes while my pasta boiled \nAlso added some herbs to it and salt and pepper of course.

{"title": "Dehydrated Soup", "selftext": "Hi! I am working on a dehydrated soup experiment. I work at a museum and we are having a space theme event. My idea was to dehydrate a tomato soup, guests can come up and reconstitute the soup with hot water, and get a feel for what astronaut food is like. However, my biggest challenge is I don't have an electrical outlet close to me, so I will have to use hot water in a kettle/coffee craft. \n\nAfter my soup was dehydrated, I blitzed it up and made it into a powder. However, once I added the hot water, it stayed fairly chunky and did not dissolve as well as I would like. I was wondering if anyone would have suggestions on how to help the powder to become more soup(y)? Or if maybe there is another soup to try out that reconstitutes faster than tomato? I think I saw somewhere on the internet that someone had luck with pea soup reconstituting faster. Oooor is there anything I can add or do to the tomato powder to help liquify it faster?\n\nI added my tomato powder back into the dehydrator and I plan to run it again over night. My thought was maybe it will dry out even more and then in the morning I can blend it again and hopefully make the powder even more fine to help dissolve it?\n\nAny suggestions welcome!

I mean that this will be my first attempt at dehydrating.\nSo here's what I'm wanting to create:\n\n-Roasted garlic and jalape\u00f1o powder-\n\nI currently have 13 heads of garlic and 3 jalape\u00f1os (all were grown by my very kind neighbor)\nI'm wanting to use this as a trial batch, as once I'm comfortable with the process, I plan to make enough to give as xmas gifts this year.\n\nThe process I have in mind currently:\n1.) Roast garlic heads in tinfoil with salt and pepper until caramelized\n2.) Using a charcoal grill, roast jalape\u00f1os until skin is charred (will have seeds removed before roasting)\n3.) Squeeze out the caramelized garlic and add jalape\u00f1os to food processor and blend till even paste consistency\n4.) Spread paste across silicone mat in dehydrator and dehydrate until completely dry\n5.) Powderize \n\nMy current questions for you guys (Im sorry that there are so many):\n\n1.) I've seen that you guys advise people to not use any oils, so what would you recommend I do to get the best caramelized garlic without a fat?\n\n2.) What ratio of garlic heads to jalape\u00f1os do you think would yield the best flavor?\n\n3.) Will the charcoal grilled flavor be preserved when dehydrating? And if not, what can I do to make it present?\n\n4.) I am wanting to fill (12) 4oz jars, how much produce should I plan to get in order to make enough powder to fill them at least 3/4 full.\n\n5.) I'm considering adding roasted shallots to the powder as well, im just very allergic to it (and onions). Do you guys think this will enhance the flavor enough that I should go for it?\n\n6.) Should I plan to can the jars in order to help preserve them?\n\n7.) Are there any other ingredients that you feel I should add in order to make the best seasoning powder that I can? I have some bell peppers and limes I could add as well\n\n8.) I'm using my mom's round magic chef dehydrator that's about as old as I am. It has 5 trays, but only 1 silicone mat. Can I used wax paper instead of silicone  mat for the other trays? Do I have to keep all 5 trays in place while dehydrating, or can I just used the ones that my paste is on?\n\n9.) I understand that I need to do this in a well ventilated space, but because my apartment is very small, would having it sitting on the stove with the hood turned on be enough to prevent my entire place from smelling like garlic? \n\n10.) The dehydrator doesn't have any temperature control (just an on/off switch). So how long should I expect to dehydrate the paste for?\n\n\nEven if you don't have all or any of the answers I'm after, I appreciate you taking the time to read all of this. I look forward to seeing what you all advise. \n\nThank you in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dehydrating/comments/1flbs2k/newbie_seeking_a_lot_of_help/", "created_utc": 1726838226.0, "score": 1, "author": "burnerphonedotexe", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/dehydrating/comments/1flbs2k/newbie_seeking_a_lot_of_help/", "html_title": ""}

My problem with the apples is that I don't like the cinnamon on them much, the regular apples are sure great, if a little on the sour side. (I don't know the cultivar, but after looking for a while at apples on the internet, I figured they look a lot like ambrosia, not the same though.)\n\nMy question is thus: What kinds of flavors can I add to them? I heard adding vanilla to lemon water is a nice flavor, or regular brown sugar. Are there any other flavors I could try? and should I add the flavors before or after I put them on to dry? \n\nI thank you most sincerely for your answers and sharing of experience.

{"title": "Sun dried pineapple", "selftext": "This is my second installment of dehydrating foods using natural sunshine. My first dive into this was with Roma tomatoes, dried the old fashioned way. Wash, cut, place on a wire rack in the sun, cover with garden netting and wait. That took about four days or so of sunshine. To know when they're dried, taste one.  \n  \nThis time I used sliced Pineapple rings that were canned in natural juice. All I had to do was open the can, pour the Pineapple juice in a big jar, place the slices on the racks on the roof of the motorhome, cover with garden netting and wait about two and a half days. The pineapple has turned to a nice golden hue and is dried, chewy, and very tasty. I specifically bought the slices canned in natural juices because I don't want any refined sugar on my foods.   \nEach can of slices weighs 20 ounces and my three stainless steel cookie drying racks holds six cans of slices.

{"title": "Sun Dried Tomatoes", "selftext": "I was watching a video on making sun dried tomatoes in Italy using only some screen covered racks and set out in the sun for days.  I thought about this and wondered how I 've gotten along as a full time motorhome dweller and not thought of natural dehydrating before.   \n  \nI happened to find this group but I see nobody was doing what I wanted to do. Everyone was using electric dehydrators and stuff of the such. Why, I asked myself. Why not use the sun like people have been doing for millenia.   \n  \nI thought about using those hanging mesh things but those all stated that they were for drying herbs. While I may be doing that as well there's other things I want to dehydrate such as tomato's, pineapple, and other fruits. Maybe some jerky as well. After a bit of googling, now called researching,  I found some cooling racks for things like cookies. That'll work I thought and I ordered a set of 3. Then I went to Home Depot and got some screening and window screen framing. A reasonable idea but once the screen was put into the frame, the frame twisted and was hard to assemble into a box. Scrap that idea. Plan B was to make a haphazard frame out of scrap wood and cover it with some mosquito netting. So far so good. I cut up what seemed like a hundred Roma tomato's and took them up to the roof with the frame, racks, and netting. Then the netting got laid down, the racks of tomato's set down and the framing. I folded the netting so everything was closed up and secured the opening with a big binder clip. After three days in the hot Arizona sun they're almost completely dry. Since I don't want to have to store them in jugs of spiced oil, I'll toss them into a bag. I'll try rehydrating them when needed. It should work with no bacteria issues since they're so dry. If I have to toss a bit of vinegar in while rehydrating then that's OK.\n\nThe cost of the racks was about $16 off Amazon for a set of three, the netting about $7 at Ace Hardware, the tomato's were at the going price but I'll look at sourcing from area farms The bits of wood were free and I did but a big rock on top of the frame because the wind does get up around 11mph on a normal day. This is a very doable low cost way of dehydrating. The goal is to have all kinds of stuff dehydrated naturally by the sun for weight reduction, space savings, and later use( I make a lot of soups).\n\nMeats I'm on the fence about. I've made my own Elk jerky before and though it wasn't made to certain temperatures for a certain length of time, it was tasty, smoked, and I'm still alive. Native Americans have been eating Pemmican and jerky since there were meats so again, it's very doable.

I know organ meats are super nutritious, and my pup goes absolutely crazy for them!\n\nFrom what I understand, there are two ways to prepare them:\n\n1. **Slice and dehydrate raw**\n2. **Cook first, then slice and dehydrate**\n\nI\u2019m wondering\u2014what\u2019s the difference between the two methods? Does cooking first make the meat easier to digest but reduce its nutritional value?\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that store-bought freeze-dried raw liver treats sometimes give my 10-year-old, 15-lb Yorkie/Chihuahua mix diarrhea if he eats too much. I assumed it\u2019s because liver is \"too rich\" (too nutritionally concentrated?) or maybe just a low-quality brand.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been pressure-cooking beef liver (10 min in the Instant Pot with chicken broth), then slicing and dehydrating. I\u2019ve done the same with beef kidney, chicken, and turkey gizzards. He can eat these non-stop without any tummy troubles.\n\nI don\u2019t know all the science behind it, but in simple terms\u2014does cooking help with digestion? Am I losing too many nutrients in the process? And does the dehydration temp matter (e.g., 120\u00b0F for longer vs. 140\u00b0F for shorter)?

{"title": "Excalibur quality control disappointments", "selftext": "Mid-December, as a treat to myself, I decided to upgrade my 15 year old, tiny bottom-heater donut dehydrator and bought a 5-tray Excalibur online, which said it would come with 4 silicone mats. \n\n\nRight before New Years, I received the package. It had a unit with glued-down but broken trim that drew blood, and no silicone mats. It was also at least 4x louder than I'd hoped, perhaps bc it didn't seem assembled quite properly. I started an email process that set up a replacement and a shipment of silicone mats.\n\n\nA week and a half later, I got a unit that seemed functional. A day after that, I got one silicone mat.\n\n\nI began using the dehydrator, and once I tightened a loose screw, it was only twice as loud as I'd hoped. But I could see flashing when I looked at the back panel. Looking inside, I saw a yo-yo shaped part that was sparking steadily along the middle bit. I searched this sub, and this sparking issue has been mentioned. It got a mixture of comments saying it was either a significant problem, or just the way the thermostat in it works. I sent a video to the company to get clarification, and they are now sending me a label to return this one for yet another replacement unit. Still no last 3 mats.\n\n\nI'm just so frustrated. This is one of the few times I've spent money on myself in years and it just keeps failing. Idek if the third machine will function properly. Maybe I should ask for my money back and get another brand? But I did do a bit of research in the first place, and Excalibur was supposed to be a great brand.\n\n\nI don't know what I'm asking for.

{"title": "Dehydrated Soup", "selftext": "Hi! I am working on a dehydrated soup experiment. I work at a museum and we are having a space theme event. My idea was to dehydrate a tomato soup, guests can come up and reconstitute the soup with hot water, and get a feel for what astronaut food is like. However, my biggest challenge is I don't have an electrical outlet close to me, so I will have to use hot water in a kettle/coffee craft. \n\nAfter my soup was dehydrated, I blitzed it up and made it into a powder. However, once I added the hot water, it stayed fairly chunky and did not dissolve as well as I would like. I was wondering if anyone would have suggestions on how to help the powder to become more soup(y)? Or if maybe there is another soup to try out that reconstitutes faster than tomato? I think I saw somewhere on the internet that someone had luck with pea soup reconstituting faster. Oooor is there anything I can add or do to the tomato powder to help liquify it faster?\n\nI added my tomato powder back into the dehydrator and I plan to run it again over night. My thought was maybe it will dry out even more and then in the morning I can blend it again and hopefully make the powder even more fine to help dissolve it?\n\nAny suggestions welcome!

{"title": "Newbie seeking a lot of help", "selftext": "Hi guys, so im very new to dehydrating. And when I say very new. I mean that this will be my first attempt at dehydrating.\nSo here's what I'm wanting to create:\n\n-Roasted garlic and jalape\u00f1o powder-\n\nI currently have 13 heads of garlic and 3 jalape\u00f1os (all were grown by my very kind neighbor)\nI'm wanting to use this as a trial batch, as once I'm comfortable with the process, I plan to make enough to give as xmas gifts this year.\n\nThe process I have in mind currently:\n1.) Roast garlic heads in tinfoil with salt and pepper until caramelized\n2.) Using a charcoal grill, roast jalape\u00f1os until skin is charred (will have seeds removed before roasting)\n3.) Squeeze out the caramelized garlic and add jalape\u00f1os to food processor and blend till even paste consistency\n4.) Spread paste across silicone mat in dehydrator and dehydrate until completely dry\n5.) Powderize \n\nMy current questions for you guys (Im sorry that there are so many):\n\n1.) I've seen that you guys advise people to not use any oils, so what would you recommend I do to get the best caramelized garlic without a fat?\n\n2.) What ratio of garlic heads to jalape\u00f1os do you think would yield the best flavor?\n\n3.) Will the charcoal grilled flavor be preserved when dehydrating? And if not, what can I do to make it present?\n\n4.) I am wanting to fill (12) 4oz jars, how much produce should I plan to get in order to make enough powder to fill them at least 3/4 full.\n\n5.) I'm considering adding roasted shallots to the powder as well, im just very allergic to it (and onions). Do you guys think this will enhance the flavor enough that I should go for it?\n\n6.) Should I plan to can the jars in order to help preserve them?\n\n7.) Are there any other ingredients that you feel I should add in order to make the best seasoning powder that I can? I have some bell peppers and limes I could add as well\n\n8.) I'm using my mom's round magic chef dehydrator that's about as old as I am. It has 5 trays, but only 1 silicone mat. Can I used wax paper instead of silicone  mat for the other trays? Do I have to keep all 5 trays in place while dehydrating, or can I just used the ones that my paste is on?\n\n9.) I understand that I need to do this in a well ventilated space, but because my apartment is very small, would having it sitting on the stove with the hood turned on be enough to prevent my entire place from smelling like garlic? \n\n10.) The dehydrator doesn't have any temperature control (just an on/off switch). So how long should I expect to dehydrate the paste for?\n\n\nEven if you don't have all or any of the answers I'm after, I appreciate you taking the time to read all of this. I look forward to seeing what you all advise. \n\nThank you in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dehydrating/comments/1flbs2k/newbie_seeking_a_lot_of_help/", "created_utc": 1726838226.0, "score": 1, "author": "burnerphonedotexe", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/dehydrating/comments/1flbs2k/newbie_seeking_a_lot_of_help/", "html_title": ""}

I have successfully made a bunch of dried products doing this (apples, pears, and a bunch of herbs to list some). The pears turned great, sweet and chewy without being rubbery. My problem with the apples is that I don't like the cinnamon on them much, the regular apples are sure great, if a little on the sour side. (I don't know the cultivar, but after looking for a while at apples on the internet, I figured they look a lot like ambrosia, not the same though.)\n\nMy question is thus: What kinds of flavors can I add to them? I heard adding vanilla to lemon water is a nice flavor, or regular brown sugar. Are there any other flavors I could try? and should I add the flavors before or after I put them on to dry? \n\nI thank you most sincerely for your answers and sharing of experience.

{"title": "Large batches", "selftext": "Newbie here... I got my COSORI 267 (6 sheets 12x13) yesterday and so far have experimented with some strawberry leather, banana chips, and apple chips. Any useful tips for processing large batches? Of course, I want to gain much more experience before buying massive quantities of fruit and just winging it, but eventually I'd like to have significant amounts of many different snacks on hand. I realize time and space are the main constraints but is there certain prep work that you can do upfront? For example: can you slice up a ton of apples and leave them in a lemon/water bath until each batch finishes up? Or is it simply make batch one, clean the equipment, wait until it's done, then lug everything back out several hours later and slice us some more? Can fruit leather puree be stored in the fridge so that you can just pour and go once the trays are freed up? After doing a couple trays of banana chips and seeing my yield fit into a snack sized ziploc, I wonder if I'll ever have a stash big enough to last a household of 4 snackers any significant amount of time lol.

I\u2019ve been trying to replicate the texture and flavor of Solely Mango & Orange gummies by trying different methods. The closest I\u2019ve come is by dehydrating the fruit by itself (also tried several gelatin-based recipes)\u2026but it still wasn\u2019t perfect. \n\nFirst, I blended mangos and an orange + some orange extract, then used a toaster oven on the dehydrate setting for 10 hours. And I put the fruit mixture into silicone molds. They were dehydrated on top but still moist and like the beginning puree on the bottom\u2026but this is the closest I\u2019ve gotten to the same flavor! Texture just needs work. \n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering, \n1- should I buy a dedicated dehydrator? Will it make a difference? If so, which metal model do you recommend under $200?\n2- were the silicone molds a mistake and should I do fruit leather on parchment instead?\n3- can I make thicker fruit leather so they still feel like gummies in my mouth and not thin fruit leather (texture thing) or will the thickness not work?\n\nAny other tips?

I did the recommended temp/time, I squeezed some of my biggest ones and no moisture was there. I did blanch them beforehand as recommended with fresh ones. They look similar to raisins and taste great! I put them in a mason jar and air sealed it, it\u2019s been about a week. I haven\u2019t seen any moisture in the jar but the issue is I do see sticky purple/blue \u201csyrup\u201d on some. Not a lot but it\u2019s there. Should I be concerned that these weren\u2019t dry enough or can this be normal? \nThank you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dehydrating/comments/1an3lz7/dehydrated_blueberries_sticky_syrup/", "created_utc": 1707526000.0, "score": 6, "author": "LongGroundbreaking92", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/dehydrating/comments/1an3lz7/dehydrated_blueberries_sticky_syrup/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
