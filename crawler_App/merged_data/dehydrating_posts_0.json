Take the top tray and move it to the bottom, every few hours.\n\nSample from time to time to get them as dry as you want. Let the sample sit out for 15 min before munching. When you get past a certain point the fruit will harden some as it cools off. To know if it's at your desired level of crisp/leathery let it sit for a bit.\n\nDo more research on storage.

I did a couple of fruit leathers(one with yogurt mixed in and all from frozen fruits), which is awesome, but took a fair amount of time/effort. Depending on local, you can usually buy Russet potatoes for very cheap in larger amounts. I know that where I am, loose potatoes sold by weight are usually over $1.50, but bulk potatoes, which may not look as nice/be the same size, will come in 10/20lb bags, for $8 or something.   \n\n\nI skinned a bunch of these russets I had kicking around, dropped them into a bowl of clean, cold water. I set a big pot of lightly salted water to boil, then shredded the potatoes on a box grater, before returning them to a different bowl of clean cold water. Once the water was boiling, I would drop some of the shredded potatoes into the water and cook them for a short time. Since they are thin, you have to be careful about it, but at a rolling boil, only a minute or two, depending on water volume/amount of shredded potatoes added. You want them to hold together but starting to cook on the outside, if that makes sense. It will probably take a bit of experimentation.   \n\n\nI removed them from the water with a strainer, then spread them out onto a clean towel which means you will lose some, or a wire rack, to drip off some of the excess moisture. I found a paper towel and wire racks to work the best. Then into the dehydrator, cranked to maximum (I have the exact same Salton OP). During the 14-20 hours it took to dry everything, I rotated the trays in the dehydrator a few times, moving the top potatoes to a lower position and the low ones to the top etc. I had a few strands oxidize, basically a spec here or there on a tray. I absolutely over loaded the trays and that made the process take much longer. The potatoes are done when they are crispy and snap/shatter when you bend them. I then broke up these big chunks of shredded potato and froze them in bags. To use them, I would simply throw a serving or two into a container/bowl, power boiling water over it and let them rehydrate, then strain off as much water as I could, then add to a hot pan with a bit of oil and boom, easy diner style hash browns. They could also easily be added to something like a dehydrated stew/chili, then the whole thing put in a thermos with boiling water for an easy hot lunch.", "Banana or apple chips are my go to easy foods.

Thats a serious foodborne illness. Toss it out, safe bet. Dont risk it!", "I would be concerned for botulism. But I\u2019m not an expert", "[This post](https://ask2.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=720870) from AskExtension addresses this topic!\n\nFrom the response: \"There are two ways you can make Tomatoes in Oil safely.\n\nIf you dehydrated your\u00a0**tomatoes halved (no more than 3/4-inch wide) with the skins removed**\u00a0you can make a safe product that is shelf stable. Dip the slices in bottled lemon juice, put them in clean sterilized jars, cover with your preferred olive oil, put on clean sterilized caps. No other ingredients may be added. Then use them after a week or so or cure them in a cool, dark, dry cupboard for one to two months to develop a lovely earthy aroma and flavor, and a brick red color with a chewy texture. With this method, tomatoes in oil can be stored safely for months. Over time, rancidity can occur, so test the aroma before you use them. Use the tomatoes first on pizza or pasta or on crackers with pesto or cream cheese. Use any remaining flavored oil in salads or stir-fry dishes. If you use some of the flavored oil it can drop the level of oil in the jar. This will result in some tomatoes that are exposed to the air and mold can develop. Do not use Tomatoes in Oil when spoilage is detected.\n\nIf you dehydrated your\u00a0**tomatoes whole or halved with the skins removed**\u00a0you can roll them quickly in a small bowl with bottled lemon juice, put them in clean sterilized jars, cover with your preferred olive oil, put on clean sterilized caps. Store them in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.They will plump up by the second day and have a bright red color. Refrigeration will solidify olive oil, so to use it, gently warm the jar in a saucepan with about 1\" of water until the oil liquefies. Cool and refrigerate any leftovers immediately. Unfortunately, the product will not develop the earthy aroma, taste and color with this short storage time.\n\nDried\u00a0**whole tomatoes**\u00a0**~with the skin on~**\u00a0cannot be preserved in oil, safely. The skins are too dense for the acid to penetrate.\"\n\n  \nTL;DR - the way you have prepared it appears unsafe (skins on, not acidified, extra ingredients (jalapenos, garlic)) but there are safe ways to do this next time", "When in doubt, throw it out\n\nBut seriously botulism is no joke you could die throw that shit out and do it right next time!!", "Garlic + oil is the concerning combo. Why risk your health? Throw it out.", "When I do this method (ie pouring the oil over the sun dried/dehydrated tomatoes instead of a canning method for example) they go straight into the fridge, like the exact same day I make them. \n\nTo my knowledge, and based off the various recipes I\u2019ve seen for dried tomatoes in oil, the way you did it is a botulism risk and personally I wouldn\u2019t risk it. All the recipes I\u2019m familiar with state *not* to do it this way.", "When I doubt, throw it out.", "I've been working with food for about 30 years and have been in manager/chef positions for the past 20 years.   \nFood safety is my #1 priority. \n\nBotulism is my favorite food borne illness. It's super interesting. Just a few Clostridium Botulinum bacteria can kill you or leave you with serious nerve damage.   \nAs others have said throw this away.", "Thank you so much for posting this, I've just been chucking dried tomatoes in a bottle of olive oil with roasted garlic for a year, it would appear Ive been extremely lucky!!!", "Just dehydrate the tomatoes and put them in a jar.

See instructions here: [https://ask2.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=720870](https://ask2.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=720870)\n\n\"There are two ways you can make Tomatoes in Oil safely.\n\nIf you dehydrated your\u00a0**tomatoes halved (no more than 3/4-inch wide) with the skins removed**\u00a0you can make a safe product that is shelf stable. Dip the slices in bottled lemon juice, put them in clean sterilized jars, cover with your preferred olive oil, put on clean sterilized caps. No other ingredients may be added. Then use them after a week or so or cure them in a cool, dark, dry cupboard for one to two months to develop a lovely earthy aroma and flavor, and a brick red color with a chewy texture. With this method, tomatoes in oil can be stored safely for months. Over time, rancidity can occur, so test the aroma before you use them. Use the tomatoes first on pizza or pasta or on crackers with pesto or cream cheese. Use any remaining flavored oil in salads or stir-fry dishes. If you use some of the flavored oil it can drop the level of oil in the jar. This will result in some tomatoes that are exposed to the air and mold can develop. Do not use Tomatoes in Oil when spoilage is detected.\n\nIf you dehydrated your\u00a0**tomatoes whole or halved with the skins removed**\u00a0you can roll them quickly in a small bowl with bottled lemon juice, put them in clean sterilized jars, cover with your preferred olive oil, put on clean sterilized caps. Store them in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.They will plump up by the second day and have a bright red color. Refrigeration will solidify olive oil, so to use it, gently warm the jar in a saucepan with about 1\" of water until the oil liquefies. Cool and refrigerate any leftovers immediately. Unfortunately, the product will not develop the earthy aroma, taste and color with this short storage time.\n\nDried\u00a0**whole tomatoes**\u00a0**~with the skin on~**\u00a0cannot be preserved in oil, safely. The skins are too dense for the acid to penetrate.\n\nOur friends at University of Idaho recently completed research for safe preservation of shelf-stable\u00a0**Garlic and Herbs in Oil**\u00a0([https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/pnw664](https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/pnw664)) with specific acidification procedures.

I bought one and when my apples were dried, I sliced the pie and put the slices in the dehydrator. It took almost three days for the lemon filling to dehydrate into a tasteless chewy substance. The crust was exactly as it was in the beginning - but the meringue was fantastic. So\u2026. I started making meringue cookies. So easy. I used wax paper on my trays to avoid getting a mess and just piped the meringue onto the trays. A few hours and WOW. I have done this many times now.

My micronutrients possibly benefit from my eating several more types of brassicas, or stone fruit, etc over a week than if I got what was in my cart, sure, but the equivalent of a cup of mixed fruit does go as a single serving on my 5 a day list. \n\nSure, I did some work over the summer, when I either paid in season prices or grew\nBeets, turnips, carrots, parsnips \ncauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage (one head was dried for soups etc)\nPotatoes, sweet potatoes, \nMixed greens for green powder\nTomatoes \nMushrooms \nBell pepper (half roasted first)\nLeeks (all caramelized first.

I am vegetarian, which may also explain all the\u2026 constant veg use). \n\nI made a number of fairly quick tomato sauces, several with eggplant and mushrooms and whatever in the garden makes a good sauce that works pureed. Then ran it through the food processor after cooking. And dried it. No extra time and I can make a great risotto with one less pot (the one that would have been cooking the sauce or veg flavorings). I have added a can of diced tomatoes just for mouth feel but flavor was there, including seasonings. Same packets could just be tossed in an Instant Pot of dried beans. \n\nI eat a lot of soups. Start a pot of lentils in 1.5 c water (all this is for one individual serving), add Better than Bullion, and in the 15 minutes they need throw together 1 cup of whatever veg looks good. Some shredded potatoes (the food processor did that in minutes) or beets for carbs, usually have several colorful vegetables in play. Dried tempeh or baked tofu sometimes. It varies a lot, sometimes Mediterranean, sometimes Asian, sometimes Mexican, sometimes it\u2019s best described as borscht. Canned coconut milk if it\u2019s Asian, some soy sauce. Bit of red wine vinegar for Mediterranean. Stir into cook pot. Great soup in 15 minutes with like 3 minutes active work. Ate so many meals on sick days when otherwise it\u2019d be a Soylent. Cancelled my subscription to that because I can cook this way when my chronic illnesses are acting up. \n\nI also do a veggie hash. About half a cup of shredded potatoes, then a mix of things like beets, sweet potatoes, some peppers, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, again it\u2019s variable. Sometimes cooked lentils or beans. Rehydrate the vegetables, then brown them slightly in a skillet and I usually eat in a tortilla (I have Celiac, reason 2 for the tons of veg) with ketchup, mustard, and sauerkraut. \n\nBasically the only things I am currently buying is tortillas every few weeks and my daily can of Coke (I don\u2019t trust myself with more than a week stored there, lol). One of the roommates is picking up my like 2 or 3 items (sometimes the soy sauce or something like that runs out) on their run each week. \n\nI did barely any extra work for a winter where I don\u2019t need to shop and most of my meals have an ease I haven\u2019t had since the \u201copen a can of soup\u201d option was lost to cost (once they actually had something I could eat in the store, which for like 5 years they didn\u2019t). And I have been sick a lot the last month. Those stray hours with the mandolin and a steam basket and the bit of time taking things in and out of the dehydrator (I do have a unit that doesn\u2019t require me to move trays around in the middle if I would rather sleep or something so walking by to check on things while in the studio anyway isn\u2019t a big drain.

Keep it going. You did good", "I had this happen. Perhaps it's not evenly moist enough (more applesauce?).\n\nI also have done the strawberry powder and that's good stuff too", "I don't know your machine, I'm using the Nessco that everyone refers to as \"old reliable\" on this sub. \n\nI use a good quality blender to blend fruit with honey. How much honey depends on the fruit - it's moisture, flavor, ripeness - and is more of an art or fortunate guessing than a science. \n\nI pour the slurry I make into ~6mm (1/4 inch, maybe a little under that) pours onto the fruit leather inserts and use an offset spatula to try to level it evenly, which I fail at to varying degrees. I have 8 trays for it and stack them all into the machine but use 6 trays with slurry at a time. I set it to 135 F and let it go for 9 - 12 hours. At 9 hours I check everything and usually the top three trays are done. The bottom 3 trays will be tacky in places. I'll shuffle them to the top and leave all my trays in the dehydrator with the empty ones on the bottom and will check them every 30 minutes. \n\nThe fruit and it's moisture / ripeness dictate time. \n\nI wind up with fruit leather that pulls off in full sheets and remains leathery. I put it in zip lock bags in the fridge because I like it a little chilled. \n\nI think you're using too high a temp for too short a period of time. I experienced what you're experiencing when I was first making it without adding honey. I also experienced it when I tried using granular sugar instead of honey, and to a lesser degree when using powdered sugar instead of honey. \n\nMy latest batch used 5 pounds of black plums and about 1/8th cup of honey. Making the slurry was a bit challenging because of the volume of fruit so I made two batches that I then combined in a large mixing bowl. \n\nI suspect that the type of honey used impacts this but, I have not tested that. I always use the same brand of honey that comes in a bear shaped container except for once, when I used a jarred brand which seemed to come out somewhat differently. I think the jarred honey wasn't pure honey and had other things in it but, I didn't investigate it or pay much attention to it. \n\nI follow the same basic process with other fruit but, I typically stick to strawberries, plums, or a mix of strawberry banana with a 1.25 medium sized banana per 1.5 lbs of strawberry ratio.\n\nI don't know if that's helpful but, hopefully it helps someone at some point. \n\nI should also note that my dehydrator is about 10 years old. I have not recently checked that it's actually producing the level of heat the thermostat claims and that my area is high humidity, which is certainly impacting things.\n\nI have never used applesauce as an ingredient in fruit leather. I have heard people doing this specifically in this sub but, have never known anyone offline who has done this.", "When it comes out like glass, I usually crumble it up and put it in yogurt or pancake batter", "I am curious about that mat you\u2019re using. Where did you get it?", "You absolutely need to add another fruit with it. Especially with watermelon. I would read about which fruits are higher in pectin vs not.

I would try to get the pectin that doesn\u2019t require sugar because I used the sugar type and it took a shit ton of sugar.

Anything you do to reduce heat, light, and oxygen that it's exposed to will help it last longer. The more of those things it's exposed to, the sooner you should plan to eat it. \n\nTo reduce this in the future, you can do like u/Gloomy_Corgi_6135 says; cook it, then rinse it under hot water in a sieve until you don't see any more grease washing out, pat it dry(ish) with paper towel, then dehydrate.

These peppers average around 40,000 scoville heat units or about 10 to 15 times hotter than a Jalape\u00f1o. You can use any type of pepper from mild to super hot.\n\nMethod\n1. Prepare the peppers. Wash and let dry completely. For thin skin peppers like Cayennes, all you need to do is make one cut to destem and open the inside cavity. For Jalape\u00f1o or peppers with thick skin, I recommend you destem and then slide in half lengthwise. For hole peppers, make sure you poke them with a fork or something sharp to let some smoke and later air go inside. If you don't have enough, freeze them to use later. If frozen, I recommend you thaw them, but it is not necessary.\n\n2. Smoke for 3 hours. Place in the smoker and add wood chips every hour for 3 hours. I use an electric smoker, the Big Chief. It peaks at around 170 \u00b0 F (about 80 \u00b0 C).\n\n3. Dehydrate. Remove from the smoker and place in a dehydrator with peppers not touching each other. Dehydrate at 125 \u00b0F (about 52 \u00b0C) for another 3 to 8 hours (varies depending on humidity, machine, and other). My old dehydrator doesn't have a temperature setting and I believe this lot was dehydrated at a higher temperature. Check every hour or two to ensure they don't burn if you can't control the temperature.\n\n4. Process flakes. I use a good processor. Pulse for a few seconds until you reach the desired consistency. I like mine closer to flakes than powder. Use a grinder or mortar to achieve pure powder form if that is what you want to get.\n\n5. Save in a jar or sealed container. Good and fresh for a year. Can use past that age, but may lose flavor and nutrients. The jar I use on my table still smells fresh despite being processed last fall."]}

{"title": "Sun Dried Tomatoes", "selftext": "I was watching a video on making sun dried tomatoes in Italy using only some screen covered racks and set out in the sun for days.  I thought about this and wondered how I 've gotten along as a full time motorhome dweller and not thought of natural dehydrating before.   \n  \nI happened to find this group but I see nobody was doing what I wanted to do. Everyone was using electric dehydrators and stuff of the such. Why, I asked myself. Why not use the sun like people have been doing for millenia.   \n  \nI thought about using those hanging mesh things but those all stated that they were for drying herbs. While I may be doing that as well there's other things I want to dehydrate such as tomato's, pineapple, and other fruits. Maybe some jerky as well. After a bit of googling, now called researching,  I found some cooling racks for things like cookies. That'll work I thought and I ordered a set of 3. Then I went to Home Depot and got some screening and window screen framing. A reasonable idea but once the screen was put into the frame, the frame twisted and was hard to assemble into a box. Scrap that idea. Plan B was to make a haphazard frame out of scrap wood and cover it with some mosquito netting. So far so good. I cut up what seemed like a hundred Roma tomato's and took them up to the roof with the frame, racks, and netting. Then the netting got laid down, the racks of tomato's set down and the framing. I folded the netting so everything was closed up and secured the opening with a big binder clip. After three days in the hot Arizona sun they're almost completely dry. Since I don't want to have to store them in jugs of spiced oil, I'll toss them into a bag. I'll try rehydrating them when needed. It should work with no bacteria issues since they're so dry. If I have to toss a bit of vinegar in while rehydrating then that's OK.\n\nThe cost of the racks was about $16 off Amazon for a set of three, the netting about $7 at Ace Hardware, the tomato's were at the going price but I'll look at sourcing from area farms The bits of wood were free and I did but a big rock on top of the frame because the wind does get up around 11mph on a normal day. This is a very doable low cost way of dehydrating. The goal is to have all kinds of stuff dehydrated naturally by the sun for weight reduction, space savings, and later use( I make a lot of soups).\n\nMeats I'm on the fence about. I've made my own Elk jerky before and though it wasn't made to certain temperatures for a certain length of time, it was tasty, smoked, and I'm still alive. Native Americans have been eating Pemmican and jerky since there were meats so again, it's very doable.

Archaeologists have used historical and ethnographic sources to discover how ch'arki was made, and from that developed a theory about what archaeological remains can be expected from that process. The earliest written record we have comes from the Spanish friar and conquistador Bernab\u00e9 Cobo. Writing in 1653, Cobo wrote that Peruvian people prepared ch'arki by cutting it into slices, putting the slices on ice for a time and then pounding it thin.  \n>  \n>More recent information from modern day butchers in Cuzco support this method. They make strips of deboned meat of uniform thickness, no more than 5 mm (1 inch), to control the consistency and timing of the drying process. These strips are exposed to the elements in high altitudes during the driest and coldest months between May and August.

Ingredients: potatoes. Nothing else. No salt, so seasoning, nuthin, so you can make it just how you like it. If you can't find it locally (they're based out of Oregon so I don't know how widepsread they are), you can [order directly from their website.](https://www.bobsredmill.com/potato-flakes.html)\n\nAs for adding them directly to the bag beforehand, that's what I do. You will want to experiment at home first to find out what a trail \"portion size\" will be for you. You could also pack along a little bag with some extra potato flakes that you can use to bolster up a meal if it isn't filling enough.\n\nAs for the kinds that have milk or cheese powder in them - those are typically quite stable in regular trail conditions. I suppose if you were stupid enough to cross Death Valley in July then maybe not, but if your up in the mountains or otherwise in 50 to 100F weather, you'll be fine.\n\nPersonally, I don't use these kind of powders. I just use regular salted butter. Heavy? A bit, but my trips are typically 4-7 days, so pack gets lighter each day. Delicious? Absolutely - makes dried food taste like real food. I use those threaded lid nalgene containers to pack in the butter so they don't leak. I probably don't need to do that, as I've never had the butter melt, but then again, I'm not backpacking in the 100F temps as I don't enjoy that.\n\nMy problem with the flavored ones, besides being rather expensive for what you get, is they're full of \"frankenfoods\" aka \"natural\" flavors and hydrogenated oils and other weird foods created in a lab. Powdered milk and cheese I don't think quite fit in the frankenfood category, though they often contain fillers to prevent them from caking into hard clumps. I used to enjoy these when I was younger and I would eat them if absolutely necessary, but I much prefer being in control of exactly what goes into my backpacking meals.", "I haven't thrown in potatoes to the dried meals.

All I needed to add was boiling water (2 cups) to make them; I'm guessing EVERYTHING in the packet was dehydrated. It definitely looked and acted that way.\n\nWith that assumption - that everything making those packets was dehydrated - I would think they are safe within the limits that dehydrated milk or cheese powder is. Commercially made versions of them are very safe. Dehydrated potatoes are a headache to make, so using a commercial source for them as well may not be a bad idea.\n\nTL;DR: I think instant mashed potatoes are a safe and filling food for you to add to backpacking, but you may find it easier to use a commercial source for your supply.", "Have you ever looked Into the backpacking chef?", "I get a big thing of them from the warehouse store.

I haven't actually tried it at home, but I would think if you say made some boiled potatoes, then sliced them up and dried them, I have a hard time believing they would rehydrate in a way that would be enjoyably palatable. Now if you're planning on simmering the food for 5-10 minutes on the stove, you can expand your food choices quite a bit. I'm like you, I hate cleaning dishes on the trail. I only clean my spoon and knife (if I cut up fresh garlic or veggies for example), because all my rehydrating happens in a bag with boiling water, stored in a Reflectix cozy. I just wash the bags when I get home and reuse for future trips. I do rinse the bags after finishing a meal (and drink the rinse water), so they're relatively clean of large chunks of food that could fester. If I wash them soon after getting home, they're good.

Very ripe. They should have the beginnings of black spots, no green, and taste in the sweet side. Go as ripe as you can and still slice them. You want the starches to convert to sugars to give you that crispness when dry. This is probably the most critical step. If the bananas are on the starchy side, they don\u2019t dry the same and they don\u2019t crisp up at all.\n\t2.\tSlice them very thin. I like about 2-3mm, around 1/10-1/8th of an inch. Thicker can work but it\u2019s inconsistent. If you go about half as thick as you did for your first attempt you should be good.\n\t3.\tDry them hotter than normal. I use 160\u00b0F. The heat removes water faster and helps the sugars crystallize and give you a crispier banana chip.\n\t4.\tDry them for a longer period. I start at ten hours. I dry them until they get crunchy.\n\t5.\tGet them off the racks and into sealed storage as soon as possible. They should cool to room temp quickly, and as soon as they\u2019re cool, get them into bags or whatever, as long as it\u2019s moisture and atmosphere tight. I usually run mine overnight so I can get them into some sort of sealed container before work in the morning.

I use frozen fruits too, especially strawberries as its too expensive for fresh when out of season, I just heated them in the pan til soft, then blend.\n\nI couldn't tell you the exact measurements/ratio of apple to other fruit, as I just put it in roughly to what tastes nice! usually around 50/50 though, especially with strawbs and rasps as they are quite strong flavour anyway.

{"title": "Dehydrated chicken grew mold, any tips? ", "selftext": "I like to dehydrate chicken as a fairly cheap and healthy treat for my dogs. So like, buying boneless skinless chicken breast on sale, sliced thin to maybe 1/4 to 1/3 inch thick (it's hard to get super thin on raw chicken breast) and dehydrated at 165F for 6.5-8 hours depending on thickness and whether I feel like it needs more time or not. \n\nMy last batch, I dehydrated on December 5th.

Jar vac sealer is like 15-30 bucks , there are a few different types, but way cheaper than most bag sealers. It can be stored in fridge sealed like that for a long while but you have to reseal to keep it fresh once you open it. So not ideal for day to day.

(Make sure to use sanitary procedures with all objects that go in your ziplock bags.)\n\nReduce as much air as possible from your ziplock freezer bags before you seal them. Sometimes I use a plastic straw stuck right in the middle of the ziplock top, close the ziplock all the way from the right and left to the middle where the straw is, and suck the air out of the bag. As soon as the air is all sucked out, pull the straw out with your teeth and immediately close that little area of the zip lock that the straw was removed from.

Even if it is removing enough moisture, until that happens it will still be wet and warm enough for bacteria, wouldnt it?   \nI guess keeping everything super clean and only slicing eg an apple when you are just before dehydrating it, helps, but there is no way to be completely free of bacteria", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dehydrating/comments/rnt3ph/how_is_dehydrating_safe_if_it_is_happening_in_the/", "created_utc": 1640374224.0, "score": 25, "author": "Mxxnlxghtxwl", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/dehydrating/comments/rnt3ph/how_is_dehydrating_safe_if_it_is_happening_in_the/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Bacteria need water to live.\n\nYou are removing said water from your food.\n\nThus, increasing the concentration of salt / sugar - both of which help preserve things.", "If I do any raw meats, I've always followed the advice to bake at 275 for 10 minutes afterwards to kill any possible leftover harmful bacteria. It doesn't affect the results in any way.", "It's a combination of food prep, the types of food, and temperature.   Most of the bad bacteria need specific temperature ranges and moisture content to propagate well.     Your dehydrator should be able to be set to a temperature that is high enough not to cook the food, but high enough to dry and prevent bacteria growth.   Low temperature dehydration depends on the food, and is not safe, depending on what it is.  For example, you want to make beef jerky at around 160F.  But you can do apples at 135F.   You also want to cut thinly to help things dry faster.   You don't want to stick an uncut roast on there to dry because it won't dry very well.   Depending on the food, there are also pre-treatments you can do (sulfites/nitrites/nitrates).", "Yeah, there's no way to be totally free of bacteria. And you wouldn't want to, you would die. I forget the details, but some 1/3 of your gut system is comprised of bacteria. Usually the \"good\" bacteria outnumber the \"bad\" ones. Most food poisoning is bacterial, where the bad bacteria temporarily outnumber the good ones, until you're body has cleared them out.\n\nBut as others have said, removing the water (even while in the danger zone) slows the ability of bad bacteria to rapidly re-produce. For the few that do,  your own immune system/gut bacteria will take care of the rest.\n\nNaturally acidic foods (like apples) also will reduce the ability of bad bacteria to get the upper hand.\n\nWhite rice is a riskier one, IMO, as it's often used as a medium for growing all sorts of bacteria/molds/fungi in the lab, both good and bad. So you'd want to add ample salt to the batch of rice and use a higher temp 150F+ to dry it. Also my experience with drying white rice is it doesn't come out all that good (tough/chewy) and it's just easier to buy store-bought instant rice. Or skip rice and just do potato flakes (also storebought), my current fave starch for trail meals.\n\nI haven't experimented with meat much outside of beef jerky (which has a high salt and acidity content due to the marinade used). I once dried some (lightly salted) cooked salmon and took it on a canoe trip in 45-70F temps. It didn't make me sick, but after about 4 days it started to smell \"strong\" and I just didn't like the taste of it anymore. Beef also tends to be fairly safe anyways, hence cooking a burger or steak rare, although such a practice always has a bit of risk nonetheless.\n\nEdit to say that I forgot I have dried canned meats. Chicken, salmon and tuna. That stuff is so heavily salted, I swear you could leave it on the counter for a day or two and probably have no problem (but I'm not willing to test it!)

I ended up dumping it into the privy. \n\nRecently my husband brought home a huge dehydrator, so I'm trying again, but this time I bought some recipe books.\n\n\"The Ultimate Dehydrator Cookbook\" goes into detail about dehydrating individual ingredients for the best finished product, and includes a lot of recipes for what to do with the dehydrated stuff.

So to answer your question: yes, some foods you can turn into powder. How long they last and how to store them depends on their fat content. \n\nHowever, how long their nutritional value lasts is another question. It will degrade over time so you'll probably want to focus on adding vitamins to your plans to address your nutritional needs and focus on high caloric foods if you are prepping.\n\n  \nI don't prep, I just focus on keeping a year's pantry going in rotation. Some items, like products made from local seasonal fruit I keep two years worth as the weather is hit or miss here and I buy from small local farmers. I think it's a healthier approach than hoarding powder you can add water to in the middle of emergencies that might never get used otherwise. Psychologically, \"reconstituted meat paste\" makes me dry heave a bit thinking about. (Beef jerky, though, is amazing... you could look up pemmican as well but I found it a bit ... not for me). \n\n  \nWhat you can do is incorporate powders into \"premade\" shelf stable meals.

By dinner time it was ready to go. \n\nSome dehydrated items will keep a while, especially if you use Mylar bags and vacuum sealers and such. I don't as I focus on reducing waste and using things before they go off. However, others, like meat with high fat content will need to be refrigerated after dehydrating. You'll find some recipes designed for camping require this as they are only really designed for a week or so in the wilderness, not years in a shelf. (I don't know much about freeze drying but it might be an option to look into)\n\nI keep individual powders to add to other things in recipes, like pumpkin, I make quick bread and muffins from ...or greens to make pesto. \n\n  \nWhat you could do if you want quick and easy access to meat is look up Townsend's Portable Soup on YouTube.

Lean or extra lean ground beef is a good place to start. Beef jerky can be done as well, as long as you dehydrate until it's brittle and crispy, you can even grind it to powder for use in stews if you want, although the texture will be a bit funny.\n\nHerbs and veggies are a similar story,fully cook, rinse, dehydrate untill crispy.\nTomatoes turn kind of gummy, as well as other fruits and won't keep very long, tomato sauce is better.\n\nPotatoes can be done as well, dice, cook, rinse, dehydrate untill crispy.\n\nI find it best to dehydrate individual ingredients, then mix stews and soups up as needed.\n\nStore everything in a cool, dark, dry place.\n\nHope this helps."]}

I add a tablespoon or two of this to almost everything I cook - soups, casseroles, sauces, bread, cake. It\u2019s free vitamins and nutrients for my family. \n\n3. Beetroot and purple things. I learned the hard way that the red pigment in beetroot and red cabbage is really strong! There were some tiny shreds of beetroot in a bag of salad I added to my green powder, and after that everything I mixed the green powder into turned pink! So I separate out beetroot (including the leaves - that pigment is in the stalks) and red cabbage from my other powders. The anthocyanins in them are really good nutrition, but I I take care to add it to red or brown coloured dishes where the colour blends in. \n\n4. Other veggies. Peelings and trimmings of carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, peppers, tomatoes. If it isn\u2019t green or purple it goes in my vegetable powder jar. Like Green Powder, I add this to just about everything I cook. It has an orange colour and a sweet vegetable smell and taste. This one is especially good in pale coloured cakes. The green powder changes the colour of the cakes and they don\u2019t look as appetising. It\u2019s better in chocolate cake. And the purple powder goes well with red velvet cake or chocolate cake. \n\nYou could mix these powders to make an all purpose nutrition powder that I promise will be just as nourishing as the commercial ones. Because those commercial ones just contain powdered fruits and vegetables too. They don\u2019t have access to some magical nutritious vegetable that you can\u2019t buy. But you will need to add a tablespoon of powder to get the equivalent of a cup full of fresh veggies. Only make about a month\u2019s worth at a time or it will oxidise.

Briefly submerge the seaweed in boiling water, then immediately transfer it to an ice bath to stop the cooking process.\n\n**Dehydrate:** Arrange the seaweed in a single layer on dehydrator trays. Set the dehydrator to a low temperature (around 110\u00b0F or 43\u00b0C) to prevent nutrient loss. Dehydrate until the seaweed is completely dry and brittle, which may take several hours. \u00a0\n\nHere are some additional tips:\n\n**Identify the Seaweed:** Before consuming any seaweed, especially if you've harvested it yourself, make sure it is an edible variety.\n\nC**onsider the Texture:** Some seaweeds, like kelp, may become tough after dehydrating. You can grind them into flakes or powder for easier use. \u00a0\n\n**Experiment with Flavours:** You can add flavour to your seaweed before dehydrating by marinating it in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, and other seasonings.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the common ways to cook seaweed:\n\n**Deep-frying:**\n\nThis creates a crispy, crunchy texture. Think of those crispy seaweed snacks you get at Chinese restaurants \u2013 those are often made with deep-fried greens like kale or spinach, but actual seaweed can be deep-fried too! \u00a0\n\n**Pan-frying:** A quicker method that can be used with thinner seaweed varieties. It can add a bit of crispness and a touch of char.\n\nOther Cooking Methods:\n\n**Adding to soups and stews:**\n\nSeaweed adds a unique savory flavor and nutrients to soups and stews. Just add it towards the end of cooking as it doesn't need long to cook.\n\n**Steaming:** A gentle method that helps retain nutrients and color.\n\n**Blanching:** Briefly boiling the seaweed helps to soften it and preserve its color.\n\n**Eating raw:** Many types of seaweed, like dulse, can be eaten fresh and raw in salads or as a snack. \u00a0  \n  \n**Important Notes:**\n\n**Soaking:** Dried seaweed usually needs to be rehydrated by soaking in water before cooking.\n\n**Cooking Time:** Seaweed generally cooks very quickly, so be careful not to overcook it, which can make it rubbery.\n\n**Variety Matters:** Different types of seaweed have different textures and flavors, so the best cooking method may vary.\n\nhttps://www.greatbritishchefs.com/how-to-cook/how-to-deep-fry-seaweed#:\\~:text=Variations,it%20thoroughly%20if%20using%20fresh.", "Just know that seaweed can have a ton of heavy metals", "please consider that some sea weeds contain high levels of iodine...rhis can be unhealthy.", "People with endocrine disorders should not eat seaweed regularly, it plays havoc with the thyroid and parathyroid glands.

I make things like stews without any meat. However I find when I rehydrate them they are rubbery. I have been experimenting with dehydrating frozen vegetables which tend to be partly cooked. They are not rubbery when reconstituted. I tend to cook with a lot more grains, seeds, pulses, nuts. I like red kidney beens, loads of energy. I dry tinned kidney beans (I squash them for dehydrating) and other beens and pulses. I also use red split lentils. Seeds like sunflower seeds get really savoury if you grill or toast them first. I tend to put them through a blender too. I have experimented with eggs and they dehydrate and reconstitute really well. Meat tends to go off so I go heavily vegetarian because the food can be dehydrated and still be highly nutritious. So I make vegetarian pasties made with nuts and pulses and grains and the eggs bind it all together. I also take chicken and beef gravy granules for flavour.\n\nThere is a technique called passive cooking where you bring your stews, in my case, up to a running simmer and then put it in a preheated vacuum flask to 'cook'. You leave it for at least an hour or two, the longer the better and when you want to eat it it's still hot and thoroughly cooked. \n\nThis guy is really good: [https://www.backpackingchef.com/dehydrating-food.html](https://www.backpackingchef.com/dehydrating-food.html)\n\n  \nThis is vacuum flask cooking.

All delicious! \n\nMain thing you really want to minimize is fat. That is what goes rancid typically and spoils a dehydrated meal. \nOn jerky, I eat fattier bits first but the rest should last a long time no problem.\n\nI made dahl w too much fat once (I think coconut cream) and it comes out rubbery. Not what you want! Next time I made it without the cream and very little olive oil and it dehydrated really well. Also dehydrated quinoa to eat with it.\n\nSimilarly for chili if using beef, get the leanest ground you can find. I used red lentil instead of kidney beans, tomatoe, cumin, chili powder etc. so good! \n\nGood luck! Main thing is try out a few recipes first. Make it for dinner then dehydrate a portion. See what works without spoiling a whole batch!", "there is a great facebook group - https://www.facebook.com/groups/610904789060556. you should join for this."]}

Not enough means you could get sick, too much also means you could get sick, so the safe recommendation is avoid questionable methods and stick to heat or curing salt.\n\nCuring salt is generally considered safe by most people.

First off, they are no longer that same creature, a pug would never survive. Second, those in the wild do have issues.

If you're going to load every batch absolutely full, or add more trays (like the round nescos), then the dehydrator can struggle to maintain the desired temp because too much food is sucking away all the heat.\n\nBut for typical loads, the wattage is generally appropriate for whatever size the dehydrator is manufactured at.

Seems like an invitation to food poisoning. But after cooking and dehyrated I don't see any reason why they couldn't be ground into a powder.", "I have no advice for you. I've never done any seafood. It's interesting though so let us know how it goes.", "I'm a bit late to the comments, but I would definitely cook (or at least cure) the meat before dehydrating. \n\nThe USDA recommends hitting a temperature of 160 degrees fahrenheit for beef jerky and 165 degrees for poultry jerky. I don't know if they have a recommendation for seafood, but I would follow the poultry guidelines to be on the safe side. \n\nYou need to hit those temperatures *before* the meat is dried because dry bacteria are more heat resistant. So if your dehydrator can't hit those temperatures quickly and consistently, you should be pre-cooking your jerky meats. \n\nFor optimal safety, you can also use a curing mix in your marinades or seasoning blends. I personally use Prague Powder #1, which is a blend of table salt and sodium nitrite. But you must be very careful with this option. It is extremely effective at preventing diseases like botulism, but sodium nitrite is toxic to humans in large doses. Common advice is to use no more than 1 teaspoon of Prague Powder #1 to 5 pounds of meat (or 1 gram powder per 454 grams of meat). \n\nFor storage, I highly recommend using a refrigerator or freezer if at all possible. I've never dehydrated squid, but I have made fish jerky out of salmon and tuna. They tend to develop bad odors and flavors after a few days of room-temperature storage, even with silica packets.\n\nIn the fridge with silica packets, they can last a few weeks before the odors build up. And in the freezer they last indefinitely. And since the jerky doesn't contain much water, it doesn't suffer at all from being kept in the freezer (no freeze burn!).  I've kept jerky in the freezer for months with no degradation in quality. And, since there's no ice forms inside the pieces, they don't even feel cold to the touch when I pull them out for snacking.\n\nSources:\n\nUSDA tips for safe jerky: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/meat-fish/jerky#:~:text=The%20jerky%20made%20with%20the%20mix%20and%20heated%20before%20dehydrating,%C2%B0F%20prior%20to%20drying.%22\n\nFor safe Prague Powder ratio: https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-prague-powder-no-1-996131", "I cut a squid \"top\" into strips and dehydrated raw.

My idea was to dehydrate a tomato soup, guests can come up and reconstitute the soup with hot water, and get a feel for what astronaut food is like.

However, once I added the hot water, it stayed fairly chunky and did not dissolve as well as I would like. I was wondering if anyone would have suggestions on how to help the powder to become more soup(y)? Or if maybe there is another soup to try out that reconstitutes faster than tomato?

One thing that\u2019s worked for me is slightly undercooking the pasta before dehydrating and vacuum sealing.

{"title": "Newbie seeking a lot of help", "selftext": "Hi guys, so im very new to dehydrating. And when I say very new. I mean that this will be my first attempt at dehydrating.\nSo here's what I'm wanting to create:\n\n-Roasted garlic and jalape\u00f1o powder-\n\nI currently have 13 heads of garlic and 3 jalape\u00f1os (all were grown by my very kind neighbor)\nI'm wanting to use this as a trial batch, as once I'm comfortable with the process, I plan to make enough to give as xmas gifts this year.\n\nThe process I have in mind currently:\n1.) Roast garlic heads in tinfoil with salt and pepper until caramelized\n2.) Using a charcoal grill, roast jalape\u00f1os until skin is charred (will have seeds removed before roasting)\n3.) Squeeze out the caramelized garlic and add jalape\u00f1os to food processor and blend till even paste consistency\n4.) Spread paste across silicone mat in dehydrator and dehydrate until completely dry\n5.) Powderize \n\nMy current questions for you guys (Im sorry that there are so many):\n\n1.) I've seen that you guys advise people to not use any oils, so what would you recommend I do to get the best caramelized garlic without a fat?\n\n2.) What ratio of garlic heads to jalape\u00f1os do you think would yield the best flavor?\n\n3.) Will the charcoal grilled flavor be preserved when dehydrating? And if not, what can I do to make it present?\n\n4.) I am wanting to fill (12) 4oz jars, how much produce should I plan to get in order to make enough powder to fill them at least 3/4 full.\n\n5.) I'm considering adding roasted shallots to the powder as well, im just very allergic to it (and onions). Do you guys think this will enhance the flavor enough that I should go for it?\n\n6.) Should I plan to can the jars in order to help preserve them?\n\n7.) Are there any other ingredients that you feel I should add in order to make the best seasoning powder that I can? I have some bell peppers and limes I could add as well\n\n8.) I'm using my mom's round magic chef dehydrator that's about as old as I am. It has 5 trays, but only 1 silicone mat. Can I used wax paper instead of silicone  mat for the other trays? Do I have to keep all 5 trays in place while dehydrating, or can I just used the ones that my paste is on?\n\n9.) I understand that I need to do this in a well ventilated space, but because my apartment is very small, would having it sitting on the stove with the hood turned on be enough to prevent my entire place from smelling like garlic? \n\n10.) The dehydrator doesn't have any temperature control (just an on/off switch). So how long should I expect to dehydrate the paste for?\n\n\nEven if you don't have all or any of the answers I'm after, I appreciate you taking the time to read all of this.

It may be best to keep it simple without adding bell peppers, as that is a common allergy trigger for some. Remember when you give a gift of anything like this to label and include all ingredients.

Sort of a chip or cracker substitute.\n\nBe sure things are dry. leave it in longer if it feels rubbery at all. Mini marshmallows take forever. I just buy them.

Don't worry about incidental oil, it won't affect anything and rancid oil wont kill you, it might just taste a little off - and I bet the bottle of oil you have in the pantry is a little rancid.  If the garlic and peppers are already 'cooked' then a high temp on the dehydrator is not a problem (they were probably cooked at a high temp).  Make sure everything is really well dried, you could use a spice mill or coffee grinder to pulverize it after dehydrating, and you possibly might conside adding a desiccant packet to the bottles."]}

But this one about dogs I can help answer. Whether dehydrated hide is safe for your dog really depends on your dog; some dogs chew slowly and bite off tiny little pieces that they can safely digest, if any, and others just gnarf it down as soon as possible in leathery and slimy chunks that can accumulate in their pipes and back them up to the point they need surgery. Most dogs I've had are in the large and slimy category, even my smaller breeds. I prefer not to risk it as babysitting them is a pain. I have in the past let my more dainty chewers have hide chews, but only when I'm supervising to make sure they don't suddenly change their habits on me. [Here's what AKC has to say](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/are-rawhide-chews-dangerous-for-dog/) about hide chews; they go into more detail about the \"it depends\" thing.\n\nAs for fur and hair, dogs can't digest it. It's made of a really tough protein called keratin, the same stuff as hooves, steer horns, and fingernails. If they eat it, they just poop it out! Sometimes this too can accumulate in the stomach and cause doggy hairballs or other problems. [Here's a link](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/trichobezoars-in-dogs) to that description. Most of the time if they eat something with a lot of hair they just get weird poops or vomit, but sometimes it can cause complications like a bowel obstruction.\n\nDehydrated tendons have so far seemed mostly safe for my dogs. They are more easily digested than dehydrated skin, but if your dog doesn't rip them up after chewing--just softens them and then swallows the whole goey mess, then it might be hard for them to digest. I had one do that on me and barf up a softball sized mass of tendon...he only got tiny pieces to chew on after that. I don't dry them myself but they are a product on the shelves if you'd like to pick one up and see how your pup does with it. If they're the kind that will shred soft stuff before swallowing it should be fine.

Should I just use Ziploc bags and freeze them?\nAnd in that case, When I go on my trip will it be ok if I don't have a freezer?\nI have so many more questions, but mostly am disappointed and frustrated at this failed attempt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dehydrating/comments/1enybgq/vacuum_sealing/", "created_utc": 1723206228.0, "score": 2, "author": "Lost_in_Ether", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/dehydrating/comments/1enybgq/vacuum_sealing/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["You;ll have to declare it when you go through customs so you might want to check on the restrictions for the country /ies you are going to before hand.", "There is a fair chance that the dehydrated food punched the sealed bags. And thus losing the vacuum.\n\nIf it was normally stored, the food probably is still good to go.\n\nAfter dehydrating my food, I usually crunch it to prevent big and sharp pieces. And then store it in ziplock bags.", "I'm sure it's still good, I only store food in freezer style ziplock bags.  In the past, I did try vacuum sealing them and the sharp pokey bits poked tiny holes in the bags and lost the vacuum, so I just quit using it.", "1) Yes, vacuum sealing in those plastic bag things is hit or miss.  I quit trying.  The bags just aren't durable.  Any little pin prick will cause it to lose the seal.  I vacuum seal in glass jars - but that's obviously not practical for travel.\n\n2) No, your food isn't bad.  As long as it was properly dried beforehand, and as long as it wasn't exposed to moisture, it will be just fine.  It's only been two days; if you're concerned, you could put it back onto your dehydrator for a few hours.\n\n3) Ziplock works. Remove as much air from the bag as you can when you close it.  You don't need to freeze.  In fact, a cycle of freeze/thaw/freeze/thaw might introduce added moisture that you definitely don't want.  Cool and dark is best, on a shelf in your pantry is a great spot.\n\nProperly dried food doesn't need to be vacuum sealed.  Yes, it will keep the food fresh for longer, but we're talking in a situation where you're planning to store your food long term, a year or more.  I suspect, at most, you're only storing your food for a few months?  In your case, vacuum sealing will be more frustrating than helpful.\n\nIf you want, you could add a food-safe moisture absorber to each bag.  Just a little extra protection against exposure to moisture.", "Thank you for your responses. And once in Ziploc bags, how and where do you store them? Room temp? Fridge? Freezer?", "I had that \u201csharp corners poking holes that cause vacuum loss\u201d with some of my dehydrated fruit. If I double bag\u2014put the product in a plastic food bag, then seal that in the foodsaver bag, it prevents it. \n\nLately I have been using canning jars and vacuum sealing the lids to reduce plastic usage, but that would be awkward for traveling I guess."]}

Repeat with the salt. It won\u2019t taste salty; the salt just cancels the bitter edge. \n\nMake a point of not noticing when the kids take their bites.

Vitamin C is sensitive to temperature but it's not a cold preventative. Just eat enough that you won't get scurvy. Honestly the dehydrated ones are probably still good for that. The two biggest problems with dehydrated food are overeating and added sugar, not reduced vitamins. If you make it yourself you don't have to worry about the sugar.

Just keep track of how much you're eating because it's so easy to accidentally eat through what would have been a week's worth of snacks in a sitting once they were dehydrated", "The nutritive value of food is affected by the dehydration process. Vitamins A and C are destroyed by heat and air. Using a sulfite treatment prevents the loss of some vitamins but causes the destruction of thiamin. Blanching vegetables before drying, while crucial to a better quality product, results in some loss of vitamin C and B-complex vitamins as well as the loss of some minerals, because these are all water soluble. Yet blanching reduces the loss of thiamin and vitamins A and C during dehydration and storage.\n\nDried foods have more calories on a weight-for-weight basis because of their nutrient concentration. For example, 100 grams of fresh apricots has 51 calories, whereas 100 grams of dried apricots has 260 calories. Nutritive value, as well as flavor and appearance, is best protected by low temperature and low humidity during storage. \\[[source](https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/gh1562)\\]"]}
