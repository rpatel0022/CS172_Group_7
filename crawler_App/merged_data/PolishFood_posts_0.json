Peel potatoes, cook, drain and allow to cool.\n2. Melt butter and allow to cool, ensure it is still liquid.\n3. In a bowl mix flour with 1tsp of salt, and 2(out of all 6) pressed potatoes.\n4. Add melted butter, warm water, mix well and add eggs, combine.\n5. Knead dough for 10 minutes, form a huge ball and leave covered to prepare the filling.\n\nFilling:  \n5. Dice and pan-fry 1 onion until cooked.  \n6. Remaining 4 potatoes mash and add twarog/cottage cheese.  \nIf using cottage cheese, first strain it through a cheesecloth-lined sieve or strainer.  \n7. Add fried onion to potato-cheese filling, adjust salt & pepper to taste.\n\nAssemble:  \n8. Form 4 smaller balls of dough, pick one and leave the rest in the bowl covered(if your kitchen is quite humid you may leave them uncovered, dough needs to be quite elastic but not too watery).  \n9. On a table roll dough to around 5mm (0.2 in) thickness.  \n10. Using a round object cut out as many pierogi as possible.  \n11. Using teaspoon place filling in the middle of each pierogi.  \n12. Close up pierogi by placing each on your hand, closing it by folding dough pocket up and sticking the edges together, then you may also fold it up again to ensure it does not open during cooking. Repeat the process until you use all the dough & filling.\n\nReady made raw pierogi place on flour covered surface to prevent sticking.\n\nIf you decide to freeze your pierogi, place pierogi separately with some space around each in the freezer on a flat flour covered surface, once they are hard frozen (around 1 - 3 hours or more) place in a freezer bag with a bit of flour inside added before.\n\nCook:  \n13. Boil a large pot of water with 1 tsp of salt and1 tbsp of oil.  \n14. Keep on medium-high heat, making sure it does not cook too intense, stir well and start adding pierogi one-by-one, at maximum covering the bottom of pot with only one layer.  \n15. Once pierogi go up to the top of the pot, count 2 minutes for fresh or 5 - 7 minutes for frozen pierogi then remove cooked pierogi from the water using a skimmer, placing on a flat plate to allow excess of water to evaporate.\n\nServe:  \n16. Place non-stick pan on a medium-low heat, adding lardons and cook until almost completely done, brown then add 1 diced onion.  \n17. You may serve your pierogi now, or optionally before you can just fry them on the same pan until brown, you may use earlier rendered lard or replace it with some butter.  \n18. Top with some freshly ground black pepper, fried lardons & onions, accompanying with ogorki kiszone.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12xpgbbb3sud1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ca005e40fda2ac58f47eec3c597d47b97ab5df6\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/polishfood/comments/1g3pb6i/cuisinskis_pierogi_ruskie/", "created_utc": 1728936288.0, "score": 6, "author": "Cuisinski", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/polishfood/comments/1g3pb6i/cuisinskis_pierogi_ruskie/", "html_title": ""}

I am seeking to recreate this soup, but unfortunately the recipe is one of those things she took to the grave with her many years ago. My dad is not of any help in this regard. \n\nThe soup, from my increasingly fuzzy memory, was a thin soup of primarily finely diced potatoes, including carrots, celery, and herbs. There may have been other veggies, but I can\u2019t confirm. I don\u2019t believe there was any dairy in it, if any, it would have been a very small amount as it wasn\u2019t a creamy soup. This a style soup that I always thickened with saltines after it was served, just to give it more body.\n\nIf this context helps, she grew up in Poland and fled to Germany once WWII ended. This likely was a soup product of low income or the great depression. \n\nWith all of that said, could this be a soup that is known in Poland, perhaps by the older generation? Or, maybe this was her own recipe and it\u2019s not based off of any common Polish dish.\n\nAnyway, if any help/direction/hints/thoughts can be given, I really would appreciate it so I can recreate some memories.
