{"title": "Did someone say Turkey Breast? (Progress pics and cut!)", "selftext": "Made some turkey today of course for Thanksgiving, your standard Butterball 3lb boneless breast roast. It turned out absolutely perfectly cooked and moist all the way through.\n\nPrep was:\n\nDefrost: I had to defrost it in cold water. I was that guy who bought it yesterday and when I had my groceries delivered it was still a frozen rock. Since leaving it out all day isn't a bad idea, stuck it in a stainless steel bowl i use often for last minute defrosting and it pretty much stayed there from 6am to 2pm.\n\nPat dry: we don't want no water, we got better liquids for that.\n\nNetting: I know some people remove it but it's a gamble based on what breast you get it may be multiple pieces. I trimmed the end with a lot of extra netting as well as tried to stretch it out as well. Use this time to make sure your turkey skin is equally distributed!\n\nOil up: no butter, you don't really want that in your air fryer due to the low smoke point. I had canola oil on hand, however you can really use almost anything you have avocado oil generally is the consensus of best due to high smoke point however I don't have any that's not in an spray can. Make sure to spread it allllll over so your seasoning sticks, after all you did dry it right?\n\nSeasoning: Super preference of course. You do you. As you may be able to tell from my last day turkey buying i also didn't prep any other way so I used what I had around. Mccormick perfect pinch rotisserie chicken seasoning \ud83e\udd0c some parsley and basil. Naturally if you just seasoning the top the bottom will taste a bit boring. Coat it all!\n\nCooking: look... yall might get upset at me here but it'll help a small subsection of people. Since I have a Dreo Chefmaker, and weirdly enough it doesn't have any turkey options under poultry... I just decided to use the chicken breast setting after all it bases it's cooking time on the probe temperature anyways and as we know... 165F for chicken and turkey! I was a little worried that it'd be calculating for a smaller object and the outside may be dry but not the case. It didn't give me an exact time but I'd say about 50 minutes total. I also don't have a temperature since I believe it cooks at multiple temperatures for getting to temp then browning. 325-350 is a safe bet though. Use a meat thermometer always to be safe of course, salmonella is not fun I've heard.\n\n\nHappy Thanksgiving everyone.

{"title": "I analyzed Reddit for the 20 most recommended air fryers in the past year", "selftext": "Was messing around with Reddit data on air fryer recs. Thought I\u2019d share the results.\n\nIts part of my side project to tinker with Reddit data and LLMs. Wanted to create something useful for the community while levelling up my coding chops.\n\nThe idea is to highlight which air fryer models that got the most love. Obviously most love =/= best. But I think its a useful data point nonetheless, especially for those overwhelmed by all the info out there.\n\nI actually posted a version of this list ~5 months ago. Unfortunately there were some naive mistakes in how I did the analysis that the sub helped point out. I\u2019ve since fixed a lot of those issues. Improvements include no longer being limited to models on Amazon, better model attribution, less duplications, model series grouping. Lemme know what you think!\n\nMethodology: \n\nI used Google and Reddit search (filtered for the past year for freshness) to source for discussions on air fryers. To be as comprehensive as possible while being resource efficient, I went through every result until the percentage of relevant discussions analyzed dropped below 40%. From that I got a total of 260 relevant threads and used LLMs to extract opinions and perform sentiment analysis.\n\nTo rank the models, I calculated the normalized difference and ratio between the no. of positive and negative user sentiments, and used that to determine the final score for ranking (weighted 70% to diff, 30% to ratio).\n\nHandling and merging different model namings, brands, abbreviations etc is non trivial so a 100% LLM approach wasn\u2019t sufficient. I did some eyeballing and manual clean up but there may still be mistakes. Is there anything there that seems wrong or surprising?\n\nFor those interested in, the source data (comments analyzed, individual sentiment analysis) can be found on RedditRecs dot com (or google RedditRecs)", "url": "https://i.redd.it/8uwyygmfhtue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744643698.0, "score": 333, "author": "heyyyjoo", "num_comments": 100, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1jz1ciq/i_analyzed_reddit_for_the_20_most_recommended_air/", "html_title": ""}

After a patch test using earbud on one corner (carefully avoiding element), the metal was fine after 20 mins. So I went in with loads of earbuds painstakingly removing the grease. Also saw a tip to bend a toothbrush, which came in handy at the end, and I managed to get my hand under the element in some areas with a sponge to scrub. \n\nI\u2019ve finished off with steaming with a cup of vinegar and some lemons to remove the remaining bits of grease and any chemical residue from the Mr Muscle. \n\nAll in all took me about 3.5 hours.

{"title": "From Frying Up Fried Chicken to Coping with Dad: My Air Fryer and Me\"", "selftext": "\nIt all started when my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The doctors gave him a year to live, but he fought like a champ and managed to stick around for 18 months. During those last few months, we spent a lot of quality time together. We went on road trips, watched old movies, and even went on a Caribbean cruise (which he insisted on paying for, even though he was broke). But one of the most memorable moments we shared was when he gave me an air fryer.\n\nNow, you might think that an air fryer is an odd thing to receive as a gift when your dad is dying, but trust me, it was perfect. My dad was always a fried food kind of guy. He loved his fried chicken, fried potatoes, and fried anything else he could get his hands on. But after a few rounds of chemo, he couldn't stomach all that grease anymore. That's where the air fryer came in.\n\nHe showed me how to use it, and within minutes, I had a perfect batch of crispy fries that were just as good as the ones from the drive-thru. But as I was frying up those fries, something strange happened. I started to feel better. My dad was there, with me, frying up some chicken wings. We were laughing and joking, just like old times.\n\nAnd that's when I realized that my air fryer wasn't just a kitchen appliance. It was a coping mechanism. It was a way to bring my dad back, even if just for a little while.\n\nNow, I know this might sound silly. But when you're dealing with grief and loss, you'll grasp onto anything that makes you feel closer to the person you've lost. And for me, that was my air fryer.\n\nSo, if you ever see me with my air fryer, just know that I'm not just making some crispy fries. I'm also making some memories with my dad. And that's a beautiful thing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/179b0k3/from_frying_up_fried_chicken_to_coping_with_dad/", "created_utc": 1697476002.0, "score": 212, "author": "Elegant-Leader-1902", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/179b0k3/from_frying_up_fried_chicken_to_coping_with_dad/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One-basket British roast dinner", "selftext": "Back again with another one-basket recipe since the fajitas went down quite well. This time it\u2019s a simplified British roast dinner. This isn\u2019t as big a serving as you\u2019d expect to see, Yorkshire puddings, simply because I had ran out. But you can definitely chuck some mini Yorkshire\u2019s on top 5 minutes to finishing up.\n\nEverything was cooked in the air fryer, but I did pre-simmer the halved potatoes for 15 minutes. This was my first time ever making roasties with the skin on, due to the fact I had to carry my 5 month old during the preparation and couldn\u2019t peel them. I have to say, I was be very impressed with them. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- red potatoes (small/medium) \n- 680g of pork shoulder (with rind)\n- large carrots\n- frozen brussel sprouts\n- frozen broccoli\n- Sea salt/rock salt\n- Oil\n- dried rosemary\n\nI\u2019ve left the quantities of vegetables out, since it depends on the basket size.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n- half and simmer the skin-on potatoes for 15 minutes \n- Pat the pork dry, score the rind and work oil into rind and into the scoring\n- Sprinkle a generous amount of salt onto the rind and into the scores\n- Roll the rest of the pork around in the excess oil/salt \n- Once potatoes are soft to a fork, drain through a colander and leave to de-steam for 5 minutes\n- Preheat the air fryer to 205c\n- Gently toss/spin/shake the potatoes in the colander to fluff them up. Do this as much as possible, without breaking the potatoes.\n- add oil to the potatoes in the colander and gently toss to cover\n- add salt and a little rosemary to potatoes and toss once more\n- Pour potatoes from colander directly into the air fryer at 205c and cook for 10 minutes\n- Toss potatoes and make space for pork. Place pork in the Center of the air basket with the rind up. Sprinkle some more salt on the rind\n- Cook for 20 minutes at 205c plus 25 minutes at 195c for every 500g of pork. \n\n**Now here it depends how much pork you\u2019re cooking:**\n\n- when the potatoes have cooked for 30 minutes in total, remove them and set aside\n- When pork is 30 minutes from being ready, pop the carrots, halved lengthways, into the air fryer. I pre-rubbed them in the remaining excess oil/salt from the chopping board earlier\n-  with 20 minutes remaining, toss, chuck the broccoli and brussel sprouts in. \n-  Finally, with 10 minutes remaining, toss, crank the heat up to 205c again and add the potatoes on top of the carrots and greens\n\nLeave the pork to rest for 10 minutes, remove the perfectly crackled crackling and break into pieces.\n\nServe with beef gravy and apple sauce.\n\n\nAs always, just wing it. The important thing is to make sure you don\u2019t overcook the pork, and please don\u2019t leave the roasties in with the greens and carrots for too long otherwise they\u2019ll lose their crispness. \n\nI\u2019m far from a chef and lightyears from a writer, so if anything doesn\u2019t make sense just ask!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/zmx0gn", "created_utc": 1671140645.0, "score": 186, "author": "designer_by_day", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/zmx0gn/onebasket_british_roast_dinner/", "html_title": ""}

Unfortunately, a lot of these posts have been used as targeted harassment and making fun of a user here who suffered an unfortunate accident. \n\nPosts about burnt food and accidents = okay\n\nMemes about Air Fryers exploding/burning down stuff = not okay\n\nViolators will be given one warning, then banned.\n\n\nSecondly, on a lighter note, we now have some post flairs to help better organize things!! As of now we have added Recipes, Advice, and Casual. If you have any ideas for others, be sure to let us know and we will add them!\n\n\nLastly, we need more moderators. I just got a new job so I am unfortunately not able to dedicate the time this subreddit deserves on my own. If you're interested in being a moderator, please send me a message with why you'd like to be a mod, your qualifications (or lack of. It's just a moderator position lol), any ideas you have for the sub, and your favorite Air Fryer recipe! Seriously, I need more recipes for work lunchs please. I am specifically looking for people who haven't modded before, or are mods for only a few subs, as this sub deserves attention.\n\nAlright, that about wraps it up.\n\nIn recap: \n\nDon't be an ass or cruel. \n\nPost flairs!!\n\nModerators wanted!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/maxcyy/an_update_to_the_subreddit/", "created_utc": 1616445490.0, "score": 170, "author": "Strinck", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/maxcyy/an_update_to_the_subreddit/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The **Air Fry** mode typically runs at max airflow, which is great for making things crispy fast, such as french fries.\n\n2. If your air fryer doesn\u2019t have a bake function, try lining the bottom of the cooking basket with aluminum foil (as shown in pic).

I actually forgot my oven isn't working, maintenance hasn't made it out in over a week to fix it and I really just don't use it that much.

So I didn't want to disappoint him and I have a small square pan, I believe it's 8\u00d78 that fits perfectly. Instead of making a medium size pizza I made 2 small square ones. I'll put the recipe in the comments along with some tips that I figured out because I really did this last minute, trial and error lol. But luckily the first and second one came out pretty great!! (Even though I can put 2 racks in at the same time I usually cook things one at a time one, I've tried putting both racks in but things don't cook evenly and have to rotate them) Only problem was that the bottom of the crust didn't come out as crispy as we like. For some people it might have been perfect but we like it a little extra crispy. I'm open to advice about how to get the bottom of the crust crispier without burning to top edges! ***And yes it would have been easier to do the pizzas in the oven but please note I couldn't because mine is not working, but we still got to have pizza night!***", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/132fzxo", "created_utc": 1682732602.0, "score": 150, "author": "Adventurous_One9400", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/132fzxo/air_fryer_pizza/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I analyzed Reddit for the 20 most recommended air fryers in the past year", "selftext": "Was messing around with Reddit data on air fryer recs. Thought I\u2019d share the results.\n\nIts part of my side project to tinker with Reddit data and LLMs. Wanted to create something useful for the community while levelling up my coding chops.\n\nThe idea is to highlight which air fryer models that got the most love. Obviously most love =/= best. But I think its a useful data point nonetheless, especially for those overwhelmed by all the info out there.\n\nI actually posted a version of this list ~5 months ago. Unfortunately there were some naive mistakes in how I did the analysis that the sub helped point out. I\u2019ve since fixed a lot of those issues. Improvements include no longer being limited to models on Amazon, better model attribution, less duplications, model series grouping. Lemme know what you think!\n\nMethodology: \n\nI used Google and Reddit search (filtered for the past year for freshness) to source for discussions on air fryers. To be as comprehensive as possible while being resource efficient, I went through every result until the percentage of relevant discussions analyzed dropped below 40%. From that I got a total of 260 relevant threads and used LLMs to extract opinions and perform sentiment analysis.\n\nTo rank the models, I calculated the normalized difference and ratio between the no. of positive and negative user sentiments, and used that to determine the final score for ranking (weighted 70% to diff, 30% to ratio).\n\nHandling and merging different model namings, brands, abbreviations etc is non trivial so a 100% LLM approach wasn\u2019t sufficient. I did some eyeballing and manual clean up but there may still be mistakes. Is there anything there that seems wrong or surprising?\n\nFor those interested in, the source data (comments analyzed, individual sentiment analysis) can be found on RedditRecs dot com (or google RedditRecs)", "url": "https://i.redd.it/8uwyygmfhtue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744643698.0, "score": 325, "author": "heyyyjoo", "num_comments": 100, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1jz1ciq/i_analyzed_reddit_for_the_20_most_recommended_air/", "html_title": ""}

Just had to share these mini chocolate cinnamon rolls I made in my air fryer tonight. Never thought I could get bakery-quality cinnamon rolls from an air fryer, but these turned out incredible!\n\nMini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Style)\nMakes 9-12 rolls\n\nDough:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 2 tbsp sugar\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- \u00be cup warm milk (38-40\u00b0C)\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted\n- 1 egg (room temperature)\n\nFilling:\n- 2 tbsp softened butter\n- 2 tbsp brown sugar\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\n- \u00bc cup mini chocolate chips/chopped chocolate\n\nOptional Glaze:\n- \u00bc cup cream cheese, softened\n- 2 tbsp powdered sugar\n- 1 tbsp butter, soft\n- Splash of milk or vanilla\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.\n\n2. Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough and roll into a rectangle about 10x12 inches. Spread softened butter, sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. Roll tightly from the short side and slice into 9-12 mini rolls.\n\n3. Second rise: Place rolls in a parchment-lined air fryer tray, spaced slightly apart. Cover lightly and let rise for 30-40 minutes until puffed up.\n\n4. Air fry: Preheat air fryer at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for 3 minutes. Air fry rolls at 160\u00b0C for 8-10 minutes until golden on top and soft inside. You may need to do this in 2 batches.\n\n5. Glaze: Mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth. Spread over warm rolls.\n\nWhat I learned:\n- The air fryer creates the perfect environment for these rolls - crisp outside, soft inside\n- No need to heat up the whole oven\n- Cooking time is nearly half compared to conventional oven\n- The mini size makes them cook evenly without burning\n- Parchment paper is essential to prevent sticking\n\nHas anyone else discovered unexpected baking wins in their air fryer?

That seemed odd, so I tested it with an oven thermometer and it\u2019s definitely reaching the right temperature quickly.\n\nThe weird thing is, the heat doesn\u2019t seem to penetrate the food properly. I\u2019ve tried again with smaller chicken breast fillets, made sure not to overcrowd the basket, preheated it, and shook things regularly. But when I check with a meat thermometer, the readings are all over the place\u2014some parts are hitting 80\u00b0C, others right next to them are still around 60\u00b0C.\n\nToday I tried a ready meal that\u2019s supposed to cook at 160\u00b0C for 25 mins in a regular oven. I did exactly that in the air fryer, and while the outside was super crispy, the internal temp was only 58\u00b0C.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing wrong, and I\u2019m surprised it seems to be slower than my oven.

{"title": "Typhur Dome 2+Sync probe", "selftext": "I got my first ever airfryer a couple of days ago - a Typhur Dome 2. I also got a Typhur Sync Dual wireless temp probe set. \n\nTonight was my second attempt at cooking a steak. Last time was with no temp probe and using the Steak preset on the fryer. \n\nTonight, I put the probe in, went into the Typhur app on my phone, went into the recipe section, picked Ribeye Steak (though mine was a NY Strip), selected Rare and then adjusted it up to a 130F internal temp target, and tapped Start Cook. \n\nThis set things up to use the temp probe in Smart mode (versus Manual mode). \n\nThe app told me to press Start on the fryer control panel. I did that. It displayed Preheat and started counting down from some number of minutes (8?). \n\nWhen the preheat was done, the fryer beeped and paused. The app on my phone displayed a notification that the preheat was done and to put my steak in. No grill tray in. Steak directly on the bottom of the drawer. \n\nI did that. The fryer detected the drawer open and close and started cooking. \n\nThe app showed me an estimated cook time after a couple of minutes. \n\nAfter 4 minutes, I opened the drawer and flipped the steak. That was the only thing I did that was not prompted by the app. \n\nApparently, Smart mode monitors the meat temp and how fast it is going up. It uses that to figure out when to take it out so that it can rest and then be at the target temp. \n\nJust before the meat temp got to 130, the app popped up a notice that the cook was done and to take the meat out. I did that and it detected the drawer open/close. \n\nIn the app it showed Resting and counted down 3 minutes. I was watching the meat temp the whole time. \n\nAt the end of the 3 minutes of resting, it told me it was done cooking. At that time, it showed the meat temp as 132F. \n\nPretty darn good job, in my book! I cut the steak in half then. I think the pic shows what a good job it did. \n\nI have never cooked steak by temp before. I have always grilled and gotten the temp I wanted by feel. I wasn\u2019t really sure exactly what temp to aim for. \n\nThis is like Grilling for Dummies. So easy! The last pic is a screenshot of the app from my phone, just before it finished cooking and told me to take the food out. \n\nI like it a bit more rare than that so next time I\u2019ll probably lower the target temp to 125. Otherwise, this steak was juicy and tasted great!\n\nSo far, I am super happy with this purchase!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwg4bw", "created_utc": 1744340838.0, "score": 19, "author": "stuartv666", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1jwg4bw/typhur_dome_2sync_probe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What are your best / favorite AF tips & hacks?", "selftext": "Bonjour.  This is my first post here.\n\nSo, I've only had my AF for a year or two, and am still finding uses.  Now, I might be forgetting something, but here's my tips, below:\n\nYou?\n***\n- Veggies: I use a basting brush (actually a small paintbrush, hah) to coat veggies, etc with a thin coating of healthy oil (like olive for low heat, peanut for high heat) between rounds of 'frying.' I keep the brush in a mason jar with a little oil at the bottom so that I don't have to necessarily keep cleaning and drying it afterwards.\n\n- I find that the store-bought grill-liners work okay, but can still let stuff through, dirtying the grill element over time, which can later be a chore to clean. So, for most food I use a disposable aluminum baking pan sitting on top of the grill to bake stuff. Various sizes work, and you can easily bend them to fit. When they get dirty it's super-easy to toss 'em in the sink to soak and clean a bit later. Or if necessary, just toss 'em, period. (not sure if they can be recycled at that point)\n\n**Note**: Using a baking pan \\*does* mean that you won't get the nice convection effect of the hot air cycling underneath the grill to help cook foods evenly. In which case you'll usually need to turn your food and cook it in shorter steps. Point is-- sometimes you'll want to do it one way, and sometimes the other.\n\n- The AF is AMAZING at crisping up stale snacks!  You'll just need to find the right mix of heat and time variables. 240\u00b0F at 3min is generally a safe place to start, altho should be eased back for snacks with coatings, like cheese, which can easily burn. Other snacks like crackers can actually tolerate the default heat of 370\u00b0F, so it's good to make a little 'snack-heat-chart' for your particular AF and regional elevation.\n\n**Note**: The baking pan is generally a must for this step, because the snacks tend to blow all around. Also, if you hear the snacks bumping in to the fan, then it's probably a good idea to put some kind of metal mesh on top of the pan in order to preserve the life of your AF.\n\n- Altho I'm generally vegetarian, sometimes I have a well-seasoned salmon or tuna steak, in which I put a little oil, butter or ghee (clarified butter) in the bottom of a pan, and I find that the fish bakes up quickly and beautifully (300\u00b0F), turning once for two steps total. Indeed, I understand that other meats also work well in the AF, altho seem to take more time to cook up. I'd think that poultry would be next-quickest after fish, with beef taking the longest due to its general density.\n\n\\* For those in a 'centigrade region,' I believe that the default AF heat should be ~188\u00b0C.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/1jvfs4z/what_are_your_best_favorite_af_tips_hacks/", "created_utc": 1744230169.0, "score": 3, "author": "JohnnyEnzyme", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1jvfs4z/what_are_your_best_favorite_af_tips_hacks/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How can I get a crispier pork belly?", "selftext": "So, I tried a pork belly last week in the air fryer,  I poked some small holes in the skin, scored the meat side, seasoned the meat side, foiled around the meat seat, paper towel dryed the skin, brushed vinegar on the skin, air fryer for 30min at 200F.  Took out, some light salt and oil brushed, back in air fryer 30min at 400F.  WOW, this was extremely crispy, as much crisp as you could imagine.  Now, the downside is I didn\u2019t like how thin this pork belly was, I didn\u2019t like the cut. \n\n\nI went to a different place today to get a pork belly, it was thicker and looked a lot closer to what I wanted.  I did the same recipe, but I couldn\u2019t get enough moisture out of this skin, when I took it out at the 30min mark, I noticed the skin was much less dry, so I paper toweled it again as much as I could, but I could tell it was going to turn out poorly.  Put it back in for 30min at 400F (knowing I\u2019d have to cook longer but just wanted to see where I was at).   Took it out, skin was terrible 0 crisp, put it back in for 10 min, Same thing, terrible crisp.   Thought the meat looked done, so I took it out as I don\u2019t think it was ever going to crisp.   Meat was fantastic, much closer to what I was looking for compared to last week, but what can I change to get a much better crisp on this pork belly?  Salt crust instead of vinegar for first 30min? Salt crust overnight in the fridge?  Do I just need to cook it much longer? Higher temp? I\u2019m not sure what I should try but I need to do something drastically different, absolutely 0 crisp. \n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!

We're a family of two adults and a constantly hungry two-year-old, and we're looking to buy our first air fryer. We're hoping it'll help us make faster meals that are also a bit more delicious than what we've been doing so far.\n\nI'm currently considering a few options like the Cosori Dual Blaze, Turbo Blaze, or even the Cosori Twinfry, but l'm a bit concerned about the size. The space we have available for the fryer is 48 cm (L) x 65 cm (D) x 60 cm (H), and I'm not sure if the former model will fit comfortably.\nFor example, I could rotate the Twinfry to fit the depth of the counter, but that would compromise both usability and aesthetics, so I'm leaning towards forgetting that option.\n\nIdeally, I'd love a fryer that can cook a main course and veggies simultaneously, but I'm unsure if that's possible with a non-dual fryer.\nAny recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/1j7zfui/air_fryer_recommendation_for_a_family_of_25/", "created_utc": 1741615682.0, "score": 3, "author": "Legiuitorul", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1j7zfui/air_fryer_recommendation_for_a_family_of_25/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Question about issues with food sticking", "selftext": "Hi, new Air Fryer owner here (Cosori 6 quart). I love this appliance but I have an issue with food sticking.  I have silicone basket liners which are fine, but they don't elevate food out of drippings -- they only have very shallow ridges on the bottom that don't do the trick.  So I bought some circular metal mesh racks made of stainless steel and use those inside the silicone liners, which gave excellent results in terms of crispiness, but nearly everything I put on the mesh rack sticks terribly. (Cinnamon rolls, breaded fish filets, french fries/tater tots...). I've tried wiping the mesh with vegetable oil on a paper towel, and that didn't stop the sticking. So I'm wondering what I should be trying next?\n\nOil sprayers are apparently what some people use but given my results with just wiping on oil, I don't see how spraying the mesh would be any better.  I tried to find some mesh baskets with non-stick coating and couldn't find any. There were some very \"open\" racks for kebabs and such that had nonstick coating but fries and tater tots would fall right through because the spacings are too large (and the racks tend to not have sides so again, fries would fall off.)  \n\nI've read that maybe perforated parchment paper set on top of the metal mesh rack might finally do the trick (nice crispy food, no drippings, no sticking) but since they're disposable I'd have to keep buying them, which is something I'd prefer not to do. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions for accessories, greasers, or whatever, that I can use to get the results I want?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/1j286gw/question_about_issues_with_food_sticking/", "created_utc": 1740968455.0, "score": 1, "author": "Maytree", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1j286gw/question_about_issues_with_food_sticking/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I am truly amazed at how much better it is and wanna spread the gospel to avoid the Instant Pot one.\n\nTo prove I am not a bot or have an agenda benefitting either company, I will say the Instant Pot itself is hands down the best electric pressure cooker system in existence, and I'd fully recommend you buy that over any other one.\n\nAlso on the flipside, I'd say Ninja devices aren't always amazing because I had their blender / food processor combo and that thing died from normal use after 1.5 years.\n\nIf you have trouble deciding on your Air Fryer go for any of the Max Crisp Ninja ones.

For the first month or so I googled instructions for everything I cooked, which led me to pot pies. Most everything I found in my search said pot pies didn't cook well in an air fryer. So I started experimenting. I'll share what I found works best, incorporating the microwave, to get flaky top and bottom crust, fully cooked pot pies in less than 10 minutes. \n\nThis works for cheap $1 pies, as well as larger Marie Calendars pies, just adjust cooking times. \n\nI start by placing pies in the air fryer until the top crust starts to brown. I think this step crisps the crust before it has the chance to get soggy like it would in the microwave. \nI then place pot pie in the microwave. I adjust the time to about a minute less than the package calls for, this cooks the inside from frozen. Then I place pie back in the air fryer until the top crust shows a golden brown. This process cooks the bottom crust to a flaky golden brown as well. They remind me of the oven baked crispy crust pies in aluminum tins from my childhood.

{"title": "Need help finding an air fryer without any non-stick coating in Austria / Europe", "selftext": "I've been meaning to get a tabletop convection oven for a while, but till recently, haven't been able to find any that don't have non-stick coatings on the inside of the basket. I did some searching around on reddit and it seems that glass / stainless steel baskets are not as popular primarily because they add to cost, which is quite the shame. Here's what I'm looking for:\n\n *  **Something small-ish**: the primary reason for getting one is so I don't need to fire up my regular oven when my SO and I want to bake like... 10 nuggets and nothing else. The oven usually takes 10+ minutes to preheat, and another 15+ minutes to bake. All of that time and energy wasted for some finger food is lame. What's the smallest size that I could reasonably get away with without terribly sacrificing performance?\n *  **Non-coated basket**: I do not like hand washing and I will 100% be tossing the basket in my dishwasher - which means no matter what kind of coating it is, it will come off sooner rather than later. The basket needs to be as hardy as the rest of my stainless steel cookware.\n *  **Durable**: I would love it if the thing didn't die on me in 2 years. Most of the stuff in my kitchen has lasted me at least 5 years, some of it's going on 10. I don't particularly trust these appliances manufactured with a *made-in-china-as-cheap-as-possible* philosophy.\n\nI don't mind splurging if the device meets my criteria. If it's expensive, I'll just wait and save up. That said, 've had very little luck finding something that fits all three of my criteria. So far, here's what I've found:\n\n *  [KHF-550](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/KHF-550-Display-Airfryer-Silicone-Standard/dp/B0CGC362TX): Is small, has a glass basket with a stainless steel rack. Never heard of the brand, though, and some of the 1 star reviews are a bit sus.\n *  [GourmetMaxx](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/GOURMETmaxx-AirFryer-Grease-free-Function-Transparent/dp/B0CT3VT93K): Smaller than the KHF-550, but several threads here suggest that that's not necessarily a good thing. Also has a glass bowl and stainless steel rack. Never heard of this brand either, and there are only three reviews.\n *  [Lifetter(???)](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Airfryer-Functions-Automatic-Shut-Off-Function/dp/B0DCVVD7XC): Bigger, but also less wattage. No reviews. I'm sure it will last 30+ years^(/s)\n *  [Lauben 5500BG](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Lauben-5500BG-Capacity-Programmes-Adjustment/dp/B0D5ML6TW8): Glass bowl but coated insert (might be able to replace it with a steel one?). The thing swivels and can be used as a grill...? Very few reviews, and the only one-star review is about damage during shipping. Still, a sus brand and questionable seller.\n *  [Kesser XXL](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Airfryer-Rotating-Microwave-Programmes-accessories/dp/B0898NSYXR): Looks more like a toaster oven? Has only stainless steel components, but is quite large. Plenty of reviews, but they're quite mixed and the one-star ones are concerning.\n *  [Create](https://www.amazon.de/Oil-Free-Capacity-Programmes-Container-Temperature/dp/B0DM94G3P2): Glass bowl, stainless steel rack, compact but low power, plenty of reviews... But it can't be shipped to my location for some reason.\n\nDoes anyone here have any experience with any of these devices? Or is my only choice here to get a toaster-oven style appliance? If so, which ones are the most recommended?

It was $48 on clearance at walmart due to the red color not being very popular. The Cosori performs better than the Ninja in a very key aspect, the removable basket design. \n\nSince the sides are also detachable from the overall basket, they can add vents to the side of the basket. This allows the circulation of air to the underside even if the basket is completely full. Ninja's removable plate design would always result in a soggy underside if I overfilled due to the air being unable to circulate. In a scenario where both are half empty, they perform the same - slight edge to the Ninja.The removable basket vents no longer makes me afraid of just dumping a bag of fries\n\nThis is not worth selling your Ninja and buying a new Cosori.

Air fry would be the high fan high convection setting... You can even do smart trick like synchronizing fan speed and heating element cycles. \n\nOther settings remain mysterious to me, what's the difference between air fry and reheat beyond the allowable temperature ranges? Do they work the same, but simply have different temperature range simply to guide the user? Are they actually different with regards to convection amount and temperature stability? \n\nAnyway, I just want to know how my air fryer works to get the best results out of it. \n\nI would be grateful if anyone could explain or point to resources explaining the different settings of an airfryer or my models specifically.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/1hwousx/how_do_air_fry_bake_roast_grill_dehydrate_differ/", "created_utc": 1736355329.0, "score": 4, "author": "redsunstar", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1hwousx/how_do_air_fry_bake_roast_grill_dehydrate_differ/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

If your air fryer doesn\u2019t have a bake function, try lining the bottom of the cooking basket with aluminum foil (as shown in pic).

The first time I used it (and the first time I\u2019ve ever used an air fryer), I cooked a fairly large chicken breast at 180\u00b0C\u2014it took over 40 minutes to cook through. That seemed odd, so I tested it with an oven thermometer and it\u2019s definitely reaching the right temperature quickly.\n\nThe weird thing is, the heat doesn\u2019t seem to penetrate the food properly. I\u2019ve tried again with smaller chicken breast fillets, made sure not to overcrowd the basket, preheated it, and shook things regularly. But when I check with a meat thermometer, the readings are all over the place\u2014some parts are hitting 80\u00b0C, others right next to them are still around 60\u00b0C.\n\nToday I tried a ready meal that\u2019s supposed to cook at 160\u00b0C for 25 mins in a regular oven. I did exactly that in the air fryer, and while the outside was super crispy, the internal temp was only 58\u00b0C.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing wrong, and I\u2019m surprised it seems to be slower than my oven. Has anyone else experienced this with this model or have any tips? \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/1jz9bnr/new_lidl_7l_dual_view_air_fryer_cooking_times_way/", "created_utc": 1744662979.0, "score": 1, "author": "Andanother11", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1jz9bnr/new_lidl_7l_dual_view_air_fryer_cooking_times_way/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "I analyzed Reddit for the 20 most recommended air fryers in the past year", "selftext": "Was messing around with Reddit data on air fryer recs. Thought I\u2019d share the results.\n\nIts part of my side project to tinker with Reddit data and LLMs. Wanted to create something useful for the community while levelling up my coding chops.\n\nThe idea is to highlight which air fryer models that got the most love. Obviously most love =/= best. But I think its a useful data point nonetheless, especially for those overwhelmed by all the info out there.\n\nI actually posted a version of this list ~5 months ago. Unfortunately there were some naive mistakes in how I did the analysis that the sub helped point out. I\u2019ve since fixed a lot of those issues. Improvements include no longer being limited to models on Amazon, better model attribution, less duplications, model series grouping. Lemme know what you think!\n\nMethodology: \n\nI used Google and Reddit search (filtered for the past year for freshness) to source for discussions on air fryers. To be as comprehensive as possible while being resource efficient, I went through every result until the percentage of relevant discussions analyzed dropped below 40%. From that I got a total of 260 relevant threads and used LLMs to extract opinions and perform sentiment analysis.\n\nTo rank the models, I calculated the normalized difference and ratio between the no. of positive and negative user sentiments, and used that to determine the final score for ranking (weighted 70% to diff, 30% to ratio).\n\nHandling and merging different model namings, brands, abbreviations etc is non trivial so a 100% LLM approach wasn\u2019t sufficient. I did some eyeballing and manual clean up but there may still be mistakes. Is there anything there that seems wrong or surprising?\n\nFor those interested in, the source data (comments analyzed, individual sentiment analysis) can be found on RedditRecs dot com (or google RedditRecs)", "url": "https://i.redd.it/8uwyygmfhtue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744643698.0, "score": 327, "author": "heyyyjoo", "num_comments": 100, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1jz1ciq/i_analyzed_reddit_for_the_20_most_recommended_air/", "html_title": ""}

Just had to share these mini chocolate cinnamon rolls I made in my air fryer tonight. Never thought I could get bakery-quality cinnamon rolls from an air fryer, but these turned out incredible!\n\nMini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Style)\nMakes 9-12 rolls\n\nDough:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 2 tbsp sugar\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- \u00be cup warm milk (38-40\u00b0C)\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted\n- 1 egg (room temperature)\n\nFilling:\n- 2 tbsp softened butter\n- 2 tbsp brown sugar\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\n- \u00bc cup mini chocolate chips/chopped chocolate\n\nOptional Glaze:\n- \u00bc cup cream cheese, softened\n- 2 tbsp powdered sugar\n- 1 tbsp butter, soft\n- Splash of milk or vanilla\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.\n\n2. Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough and roll into a rectangle about 10x12 inches. Spread softened butter, sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. Roll tightly from the short side and slice into 9-12 mini rolls.\n\n3. Second rise: Place rolls in a parchment-lined air fryer tray, spaced slightly apart. Cover lightly and let rise for 30-40 minutes until puffed up.\n\n4. Air fry: Preheat air fryer at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for 3 minutes. Air fry rolls at 160\u00b0C for 8-10 minutes until golden on top and soft inside. You may need to do this in 2 batches.\n\n5. Glaze: Mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth. Spread over warm rolls.\n\nWhat I learned:\n- The air fryer creates the perfect environment for these rolls - crisp outside, soft inside\n- No need to heat up the whole oven\n- Cooking time is nearly half compared to conventional oven\n- The mini size makes them cook evenly without burning\n- Parchment paper is essential to prevent sticking\n\nHas anyone else discovered unexpected baking wins in their air fryer?

Last time was with no temp probe and using the Steak preset on the fryer. \n\nTonight, I put the probe in, went into the Typhur app on my phone, went into the recipe section, picked Ribeye Steak (though mine was a NY Strip), selected Rare and then adjusted it up to a 130F internal temp target, and tapped Start Cook. \n\nThis set things up to use the temp probe in Smart mode (versus Manual mode). \n\nThe app told me to press Start on the fryer control panel. I did that. It displayed Preheat and started counting down from some number of minutes (8?). \n\nWhen the preheat was done, the fryer beeped and paused.

That was the only thing I did that was not prompted by the app. \n\nApparently, Smart mode monitors the meat temp and how fast it is going up. It uses that to figure out when to take it out so that it can rest and then be at the target temp. \n\nJust before the meat temp got to 130, the app popped up a notice that the cook was done and to take the meat out. I did that and it detected the drawer open/close. \n\nIn the app it showed Resting and counted down 3 minutes. I was watching the meat temp the whole time. \n\nAt the end of the 3 minutes of resting, it told me it was done cooking. At that time, it showed the meat temp as 132F. \n\nPretty darn good job, in my book! I cut the steak in half then. I think the pic shows what a good job it did. \n\nI have never cooked steak by temp before. I have always grilled and gotten the temp I wanted by feel. I wasn\u2019t really sure exactly what temp to aim for. \n\nThis is like Grilling for Dummies. So easy!

{"title": "What are your best / favorite AF tips & hacks?", "selftext": "Bonjour.  This is my first post here.\n\nSo, I've only had my AF for a year or two, and am still finding uses.  Now, I might be forgetting something, but here's my tips, below:\n\nYou?\n***\n- Veggies: I use a basting brush (actually a small paintbrush, hah) to coat veggies, etc with a thin coating of healthy oil (like olive for low heat, peanut for high heat) between rounds of 'frying.' I keep the brush in a mason jar with a little oil at the bottom so that I don't have to necessarily keep cleaning and drying it afterwards.\n\n- I find that the store-bought grill-liners work okay, but can still let stuff through, dirtying the grill element over time, which can later be a chore to clean. So, for most food I use a disposable aluminum baking pan sitting on top of the grill to bake stuff. Various sizes work, and you can easily bend them to fit. When they get dirty it's super-easy to toss 'em in the sink to soak and clean a bit later. Or if necessary, just toss 'em, period. (not sure if they can be recycled at that point)\n\n**Note**: Using a baking pan \\*does* mean that you won't get the nice convection effect of the hot air cycling underneath the grill to help cook foods evenly. In which case you'll usually need to turn your food and cook it in shorter steps. Point is-- sometimes you'll want to do it one way, and sometimes the other.\n\n- The AF is AMAZING at crisping up stale snacks!  You'll just need to find the right mix of heat and time variables. 240\u00b0F at 3min is generally a safe place to start, altho should be eased back for snacks with coatings, like cheese, which can easily burn. Other snacks like crackers can actually tolerate the default heat of 370\u00b0F, so it's good to make a little 'snack-heat-chart' for your particular AF and regional elevation.\n\n**Note**: The baking pan is generally a must for this step, because the snacks tend to blow all around. Also, if you hear the snacks bumping in to the fan, then it's probably a good idea to put some kind of metal mesh on top of the pan in order to preserve the life of your AF.\n\n- Altho I'm generally vegetarian, sometimes I have a well-seasoned salmon or tuna steak, in which I put a little oil, butter or ghee (clarified butter) in the bottom of a pan, and I find that the fish bakes up quickly and beautifully (300\u00b0F), turning once for two steps total. Indeed, I understand that other meats also work well in the AF, altho seem to take more time to cook up. I'd think that poultry would be next-quickest after fish, with beef taking the longest due to its general density.\n\n\\* For those in a 'centigrade region,' I believe that the default AF heat should be ~188\u00b0C.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/1jvfs4z/what_are_your_best_favorite_af_tips_hacks/", "created_utc": 1744230169.0, "score": 5, "author": "JohnnyEnzyme", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1jvfs4z/what_are_your_best_favorite_af_tips_hacks/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Air fryer recommendations", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m sure this question gets asked a lot but I\u2019d love some advice/tips on purchasing an air fryer now that I\u2019ve finally decided to take the plunge and buy one!\n\nI\u2019m looking at either the Nutribullet NBA071B for 57\u20ac or the Ninja AF180EU for 95\u20ac. There\u2019s not a huge price difference, the Nutribullet is slightly bigger at 7Ls while the Ninja is 6.2Ls and comes with a crisping tray, but other than that I don\u2019t/can\u2019t see much differences between the two. \n\nAnother that I had been looking at was the Kenwood HFM 2000 MB with 8L capacity spread between two drawers. I can see the benefit of having two drawers to use, especially as you can cook different things at once, and I do like the idea of that, but I think realistically the one drawer with a larger capacity would get more use for things like roasts etc. \n\nWould you recommend one over the other, or is one more reliable than the other? I\u2019ve seen a lot of people recommend starting with a cheaper air fryer to see if you like it, but I don\u2019t mind spending the bit extra if the other would be better/last longer.

Took out, some light salt and oil brushed, back in air fryer 30min at 400F.  WOW, this was extremely crispy, as much crisp as you could imagine.  Now, the downside is I didn\u2019t like how thin this pork belly was, I didn\u2019t like the cut. \n\n\nI went to a different place today to get a pork belly, it was thicker and looked a lot closer to what I wanted.  I did the same recipe, but I couldn\u2019t get enough moisture out of this skin, when I took it out at the 30min mark, I noticed the skin was much less dry, so I paper toweled it again as much as I could, but I could tell it was going to turn out poorly.  Put it back in for 30min at 400F (knowing I\u2019d have to cook longer but just wanted to see where I was at).   Took it out, skin was terrible 0 crisp, put it back in for 10 min, Same thing, terrible crisp.   Thought the meat looked done, so I took it out as I don\u2019t think it was ever going to crisp.   Meat was fantastic, much closer to what I was looking for compared to last week, but what can I change to get a much better crisp on this pork belly?  Salt crust instead of vinegar for first 30min? Salt crust overnight in the fridge?  Do I just need to cook it much longer? Higher temp? I\u2019m not sure what I should try but I need to do something drastically different, absolutely 0 crisp. \n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!

{"title": "Question about issues with food sticking", "selftext": "Hi, new Air Fryer owner here (Cosori 6 quart). I love this appliance but I have an issue with food sticking.  I have silicone basket liners which are fine, but they don't elevate food out of drippings -- they only have very shallow ridges on the bottom that don't do the trick.  So I bought some circular metal mesh racks made of stainless steel and use those inside the silicone liners, which gave excellent results in terms of crispiness, but nearly everything I put on the mesh rack sticks terribly. (Cinnamon rolls, breaded fish filets, french fries/tater tots...). I've tried wiping the mesh with vegetable oil on a paper towel, and that didn't stop the sticking. So I'm wondering what I should be trying next?\n\nOil sprayers are apparently what some people use but given my results with just wiping on oil, I don't see how spraying the mesh would be any better.  I tried to find some mesh baskets with non-stick coating and couldn't find any. There were some very \"open\" racks for kebabs and such that had nonstick coating but fries and tater tots would fall right through because the spacings are too large (and the racks tend to not have sides so again, fries would fall off.)  \n\nI've read that maybe perforated parchment paper set on top of the metal mesh rack might finally do the trick (nice crispy food, no drippings, no sticking) but since they're disposable I'd have to keep buying them, which is something I'd prefer not to do. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions for accessories, greasers, or whatever, that I can use to get the results I want?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airfryer/comments/1j286gw/question_about_issues_with_food_sticking/", "created_utc": 1740968455.0, "score": 1, "author": "Maytree", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/airfryer/comments/1j286gw/question_about_issues_with_food_sticking/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Luckily, Amazon let me get my money back.\n\nThat being said, these defects weren't showstoppers, and it didn't fully die ever. Great right? Well, after the second death I got my money back and got a Ninja Foodi FlexDrawer. I have to say, having now used it for 1 month, using the Instant Pot was like living in the dark ages.

For the first month or so I googled instructions for everything I cooked, which led me to pot pies. Most everything I found in my search said pot pies didn't cook well in an air fryer. So I started experimenting. I'll share what I found works best, incorporating the microwave, to get flaky top and bottom crust, fully cooked pot pies in less than 10 minutes. \n\nThis works for cheap $1 pies, as well as larger Marie Calendars pies, just adjust cooking times. \n\nI start by placing pies in the air fryer until the top crust starts to brown. I think this step crisps the crust before it has the chance to get soggy like it would in the microwave. \nI then place pot pie in the microwave. I adjust the time to about a minute less than the package calls for, this cooks the inside from frozen. Then I place pie back in the air fryer until the top crust shows a golden brown. This process cooks the bottom crust to a flaky golden brown as well. They remind me of the oven baked crispy crust pies in aluminum tins from my childhood.

With the benefit of hindsight I realized that when I would use my hands the panko would tend to come off the pickle and stick to my fingers instead.

{"title": "Need help finding an air fryer without any non-stick coating in Austria / Europe", "selftext": "I've been meaning to get a tabletop convection oven for a while, but till recently, haven't been able to find any that don't have non-stick coatings on the inside of the basket. I did some searching around on reddit and it seems that glass / stainless steel baskets are not as popular primarily because they add to cost, which is quite the shame. Here's what I'm looking for:\n\n *  **Something small-ish**: the primary reason for getting one is so I don't need to fire up my regular oven when my SO and I want to bake like... 10 nuggets and nothing else. The oven usually takes 10+ minutes to preheat, and another 15+ minutes to bake. All of that time and energy wasted for some finger food is lame. What's the smallest size that I could reasonably get away with without terribly sacrificing performance?\n *  **Non-coated basket**: I do not like hand washing and I will 100% be tossing the basket in my dishwasher - which means no matter what kind of coating it is, it will come off sooner rather than later. The basket needs to be as hardy as the rest of my stainless steel cookware.\n *  **Durable**: I would love it if the thing didn't die on me in 2 years. Most of the stuff in my kitchen has lasted me at least 5 years, some of it's going on 10. I don't particularly trust these appliances manufactured with a *made-in-china-as-cheap-as-possible* philosophy.\n\nI don't mind splurging if the device meets my criteria. If it's expensive, I'll just wait and save up. That said, 've had very little luck finding something that fits all three of my criteria. So far, here's what I've found:\n\n *  [KHF-550](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/KHF-550-Display-Airfryer-Silicone-Standard/dp/B0CGC362TX): Is small, has a glass basket with a stainless steel rack. Never heard of the brand, though, and some of the 1 star reviews are a bit sus.\n *  [GourmetMaxx](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/GOURMETmaxx-AirFryer-Grease-free-Function-Transparent/dp/B0CT3VT93K): Smaller than the KHF-550, but several threads here suggest that that's not necessarily a good thing. Also has a glass bowl and stainless steel rack. Never heard of this brand either, and there are only three reviews.\n *  [Lifetter(???)](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Airfryer-Functions-Automatic-Shut-Off-Function/dp/B0DCVVD7XC): Bigger, but also less wattage. No reviews. I'm sure it will last 30+ years^(/s)\n *  [Lauben 5500BG](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Lauben-5500BG-Capacity-Programmes-Adjustment/dp/B0D5ML6TW8): Glass bowl but coated insert (might be able to replace it with a steel one?). The thing swivels and can be used as a grill...? Very few reviews, and the only one-star review is about damage during shipping. Still, a sus brand and questionable seller.\n *  [Kesser XXL](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Airfryer-Rotating-Microwave-Programmes-accessories/dp/B0898NSYXR): Looks more like a toaster oven? Has only stainless steel components, but is quite large. Plenty of reviews, but they're quite mixed and the one-star ones are concerning.\n *  [Create](https://www.amazon.de/Oil-Free-Capacity-Programmes-Container-Temperature/dp/B0DM94G3P2): Glass bowl, stainless steel rack, compact but low power, plenty of reviews... But it can't be shipped to my location for some reason.\n\nDoes anyone here have any experience with any of these devices? Or is my only choice here to get a toaster-oven style appliance? If so, which ones are the most recommended? I've read good things about Breville/Sage/Gastroback Smart Ovens, but I haven't researched this category of appliances as thoroughly (I did come across reviews saying that basket style devices work better).

I have a grocery store nearby that sells a wide variety of competently smoked meats ( not dry, good solid smoky flavor, well pre seasoned.) Around here in northwest Florida, it's grocery outlet. They sell 2.5 lb bags of smoked chicken wings for 5 bucks and change.

Then I tossed them in a buffalo sauce made from frank's red hot, Sriracha, gaujillo peppers, honey, brown and white sugar, white vinegar, just a little pickle juice, garlic, butter, Worcester, and milk last so it doesn't  scorch.

It seems evident to me that the difference  between those settings is mainly the speed of the convection fan, how/if it turns on and off, and how aggressively the air inside the enclosure is renewed to get rid of water vapour. \n\nFor example, the manual specifies that grill is mainly direct top down heating, probably with a very low fan speed, bake would correspond to another low fan setting with less convection mimicking what's happening in a traditional convection oven. Air fry would be the high fan high convection setting... You can even do smart trick like synchronizing fan speed and heating element cycles. \n\nOther settings remain mysterious to me, what's the difference between air fry and reheat beyond the allowable temperature ranges?
