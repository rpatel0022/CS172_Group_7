{"title": "Boosh Plant-Based Brands to Begin Home Delivery", "selftext": "Boosh Plant-Based Brands Inc. (CSE:VEGI) is proving that it\u2019s not only an emerging leader in plant-based comfort foods, but also an e-commerce contender with major momentum. Indeed, it\u2019s time to mark your calendar as Boosh will begin to provide direct access to its expanding portfolio of plant-based brands directly through its website, starting on Monday, January 24.\n\nThe home delivery directly from the Boosh website will drastically expand the company\u2019s existing e-commerce presence, and offer the quickest and easiest platform available to order Boosh\u2019s products. The company intends to launch on the website its six frozen entrees, the full line of SaltSprings vegetable pates, and the Pulse Specialty Kitchen line of plant-based cheeses. Shortly thereafter, the company will offer its exceptional line of refrigerated entrees.\n\nClearly, Boosh\u2019s market presence is growing exponentially, both online and in grocery stores across North America. Not long ago, it was reported that Boosh was onboarding 25 new accounts per month, and that Boosh\u2019s December monthly sales were up 442% compared to the similar period in 2020.\n\nMoreover, Boosh\u2019s year-to-date sales were up 269% compared to the similar period in the previous year. Boosh Founder and President Connie Marples also reported while her company had increased its new store count from approximately 15 new stores per month to 25 per month, Boosh is projecting a ramp-up to 50 new stores per month by mid-year.\n\nThe company is also expanding its plant-based foods lineup, with two new frozen Boosh bowls as well as one refrigerated heat-and-eat pouch in 2022\u2019s first quarter. The two new frozen entrees include a convenient Boosh breakfast bowl and Buddha bowl. Meanwhile, the new refrigerated item is sweet and sour chicken, which is suggested to be served over a bed of rice or noodles.\n\nThese new products are the culmination of Boosh\u2019s research, analysis and its empirical data that are generated from a sales prospective with the R&D created by the company\u2019s chefs, all designed to increase the likelihood of Boosh\u2019s success in the marketplace.\n\nAnd in a game-changing development, Boosh just secured a major order from a prominent national Canadian grocer. Reportedly, Boosh Plant-Based Brands has received confirmation from Save On Foods for four of Boosh's frozen bowls: veggie bolognese, which includes Beyond Meat; coconut curry cauli; mac and cheese and peas; and Mexican fiesta bowl. The confirmation calls for April delivery into a minimum of 120 stores in Western Canada.\n\nSave On Foods is the flagship chain of Jim Pattison Group, with 170 stores in British Columbia and Alberta, and is one of the major chains in the retail grocery industry in Western Canada. As Ms. Marples reports, the Save On Foods order now places Boosh in over 600 stores throughout Canada and growing \u2013 and she firmly believes that her company is on track to sell Boosh\u2019s products in over 1,000 grocery stores in Canada by year-end.

{"title": "Boosh Plant-Based Brands to Begin Home Delivery", "selftext": "Boosh Plant-Based Brands Inc. (CSE:VEGI) is proving that it\u2019s not only an emerging leader in plant-based comfort foods, but also an e-commerce contender with major momentum. Indeed, it\u2019s time to mark your calendar as Boosh will begin to provide direct access to its expanding portfolio of plant-based brands directly through its website, starting on Monday, January 24.\n\nThe home delivery directly from the Boosh website will drastically expand the company\u2019s existing e-commerce presence, and offer the quickest and easiest platform available to order Boosh\u2019s products. The company intends to launch on the website its six frozen entrees, the full line of SaltSprings vegetable pates, and the Pulse Specialty Kitchen line of plant-based cheeses. Shortly thereafter, the company will offer its exceptional line of refrigerated entrees.\n\nClearly, Boosh\u2019s market presence is growing exponentially, both online and in grocery stores across North America. Not long ago, it was reported that Boosh was onboarding 25 new accounts per month, and that Boosh\u2019s December monthly sales were up 442% compared to the similar period in 2020.\n\nMoreover, Boosh\u2019s year-to-date sales were up 269% compared to the similar period in the previous year. Boosh Founder and President Connie Marples also reported while her company had increased its new store count from approximately 15 new stores per month to 25 per month, Boosh is projecting a ramp-up to 50 new stores per month by mid-year.\n\nThe company is also expanding its plant-based foods lineup, with two new frozen Boosh bowls as well as one refrigerated heat-and-eat pouch in 2022\u2019s first quarter. The two new frozen entrees include a convenient Boosh breakfast bowl and Buddha bowl. Meanwhile, the new refrigerated item is sweet and sour chicken, which is suggested to be served over a bed of rice or noodles.\n\nThese new products are the culmination of Boosh\u2019s research, analysis and its empirical data that are generated from a sales prospective with the R&D created by the company\u2019s chefs, all designed to increase the likelihood of Boosh\u2019s success in the marketplace.\n\nAnd in a game-changing development, Boosh just secured a major order from a prominent national Canadian grocer. Reportedly, Boosh Plant-Based Brands has received confirmation from Save On Foods for four of Boosh's frozen bowls: veggie bolognese, which includes Beyond Meat; coconut curry cauli; mac and cheese and peas; and Mexican fiesta bowl. The confirmation calls for April delivery into a minimum of 120 stores in Western Canada.\n\nSave On Foods is the flagship chain of Jim Pattison Group, with 170 stores in British Columbia and Alberta, and is one of the major chains in the retail grocery industry in Western Canada. As Ms. Marples reports, the Save On Foods order now places Boosh in over 600 stores throughout Canada and growing \u2013 and she firmly believes that her company is on track to sell Boosh\u2019s products in over 1,000 grocery stores in Canada by year-end.
