I usually buy lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red peppers, and maybe a few other things but this issue is is that they usually go bad before I find a way to use them. Lettuce is a nice leafy green but it can go bad quick when I don't have everything to make a salad and I don't make enough sandwiches. Tomatoes are good, but once again I don't have many ways to use them outside of sandwiches. And in both of the above cases lettuce salads and tomatoes in sandwiches, if I make them in advance (say on a weekend) they will likely be mushy before I get to them in the week ahead. Cucumbers are also nice and green but again, no way to use them. Red peppers can be used in chili, a sandwich or something else but usually I try to save them to make a larger meal with, run out of time to do it and then throw away the moldy red pepper two weeks later. *sigh*  ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetveggie/comments/1zwjca/advice_for_veggies_to_have_on_hand/", "created_utc": 1394301125.0, "score": 11, "author": "rseccafi", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/budgetveggie/comments/1zwjca/advice_for_veggies_to_have_on_hand/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "calastinics bodybuilder meat eater making the transitioning to vegetarian", "selftext": "Like the title says, I do calisthenics bodybuilding and am trying to make the transition to vegetarian from meat eating for 27 years.\n\nI am having a hard time trying to figure out how I will be able to pull it off financially. I work 40 sometimes 70 hours a week and will picking up college again in August to finish off my degree, so I am on a college budget.\n\nI try to eat atleast 5/6 times a day and when I go grocery shopping I keep my budget under $50 a week, that's pretty do able with buying meats in bulk and cooking throughout the day. Since I work from the office I have a microwave and a stove top oven that Ill use normally to cook small meals through out the day seeing as how I have a busy schedule and normally don't have time to bulk cook.\n\nOn that note I do not have much of a desire of bulk cooking, me knowing me when I cook in bulk I hate it and end up falling off my diet since ill get in the hurry in the morning and forget to bring my tupperware to work, so Ill normally just try to bring the foods id normally make to work with me and just cook them real fast at work.\n\nIve been looking around at different foods that I can buy to keep it under $50 a week and besides the carb stables like pasta, rice and potatoes (btw I love sweet potatoes more than any carb hah) when we start talking about vegetables and fruits I start seeing the overall price jack up over $50 especially when I take into account the amount of food I would need to eat in just one day alone.\n\nIs such a diet with financial constraints do able? Is there any incite of good foods to buy to help make the transition to vegetarian that wont kill my bank account and still able to eat enough to maintain my daily food intake for the amount of exercise that I do?\n\nThanks in advance for everyone's input.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetveggie/comments/4elgm5/calastinics_bodybuilder_meat_eater_making_the/", "created_utc": 1460552761.0, "score": 6, "author": "M83Collective", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/budgetveggie/comments/4elgm5/calastinics_bodybuilder_meat_eater_making_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Tomatoes are good, but once again I don't have many ways to use them outside of sandwiches. And in both of the above cases lettuce salads and tomatoes in sandwiches, if I make them in advance (say on a weekend) they will likely be mushy before I get to them in the week ahead. Cucumbers are also nice and green but again, no way to use them.

Tomatoes are good, but once again I don't have many ways to use them outside of sandwiches. And in both of the above cases lettuce salads and tomatoes in sandwiches, if I make them in advance (say on a weekend) they will likely be mushy before I get to them in the week ahead. Cucumbers are also nice and green but again, no way to use them.
