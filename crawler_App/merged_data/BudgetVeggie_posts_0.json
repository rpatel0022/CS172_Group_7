It is a great decadent and cheap meal on the days you have nothing in the house and no money to spend!\n\nThe link leads to the peasant bread which is pretty easy to make (I make this recipe halved all the time and it works fine). \n\nThe recipe for the lentil potato soup is this:\n\n1 cup RED lentils\n\n2 cups water \n\n1 cup onion (I use one medium onion)\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n\n1 tsp cumin \n\n2-3 cups cubed potatoes (about 3 smallish potatoes)\n\n1/2- 1 tsp of salt \n\n4 cups vegetable stock\n\n1/3 cup of lemon juice\n\nblack pepper to serve\n\nTo make the soup:\n\n1. Rinse the lentils, then cook them with the water in a pot (bring to a boil, reduce heat and cover while you saute everything else)\n\n2. Dice the onions, then saute them over medium heat in your soup pot for 5-7 minutes with the olive oil and cumin. \n\n3. While your onions are cooking, peel and dice your potatoes. Add them to the soup pot with the salt and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Stir frequently (the onions may scorch to the pot, and this isn't bad, it adds flavour to the soup)\n\n4. Add the cooked lentils, and the vegetable stock and simmer for another 20+ minutes (until your bread is done)\n\n5. Before serving stir in the lemon juice. Some cilantro might be nice if you have it on hand, but it is not necessary.\n\nThis recipe works really well with the recipe for the peasant bread. Start prep on the peasant bread a couple of hours before you serve (prep only takes a few minutes of measuring and mixing). You can start baking the bread as soon as you make the soup. The bread recipe has you baking it at 15 minutes for one temperature, and I normally just use my timer for that to gauge my time for sauteing the soup veggies. When the bread is done cooling, the soup is ready to serve and they go well together with butter/margarine/olive oil dip for the bread.\n\nFYI for those without large pots. The soup calls for 6 cups water, but a lot boils off so you don't need a large stock pot (I have one that hold 5 cups and it works fine)."]}

{"title": "Advice for Veggies to have on hand", "selftext": "Hello, I'm new here and I want to have an idea of what veggies I should have in my refrigerator to make most of the food I see here. I usually buy lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red peppers, and maybe a few other things but this issue is is that they usually go bad before I find a way to use them. Lettuce is a nice leafy green but it can go bad quick when I don't have everything to make a salad and I don't make enough sandwiches. Tomatoes are good, but once again I don't have many ways to use them outside of sandwiches. And in both of the above cases lettuce salads and tomatoes in sandwiches, if I make them in advance (say on a weekend) they will likely be mushy before I get to them in the week ahead. Cucumbers are also nice and green but again, no way to use them. Red peppers can be used in chili, a sandwich or something else but usually I try to save them to make a larger meal with, run out of time to do it and then throw away the moldy red pepper two weeks later. *sigh*  ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetveggie/comments/1zwjca/advice_for_veggies_to_have_on_hand/", "created_utc": 1394301125.0, "score": 12, "author": "rseccafi", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/budgetveggie/comments/1zwjca/advice_for_veggies_to_have_on_hand/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Instead of thinking about random veggies to have on hand why don't you make a meal plan?

I eased myself in with TINY minced veggies added to things like lasagna that  have a strong flavor- sweet veggies to start. Red pepper and carrots are easy to like. Spinach is neutral if finely minced. Finely grating them works, too...zucchini and summer squash grate well. I started with only a tiny bit at a time, then upped it gradually.

Put the onions in a frying pan with 2 tbsp. oil and cook until mostly done. Then add the zucchini, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Then add 2 tbsp. soy sauce and 2 tbsp. teriyaki sauce. Cook for about 7 minutes or until zucchini is tender, stirring frequently. Put the veggies to the side.\n\nTake 2 cups of cooked rice (either cook right before or the night before -- the original recipe says cold but I think warm honestly works better) and add it to a pan with 2 tbsp. butter. Stir until the rice is coated in the butter. Then add 2 tbsp. soy sauce. Mix well until it's all incorporated and relatively uniform. Cook maybe 1 minute after adding the soy sauce.\n\nPut the rice in bowls and top with the veggies. If you want, cook some chicken in small pieces and add it to the veggies at the very end of cooking your zucchini (or even after). You could easily add mushrooms or carrots or other veggies to this as well. If you have sesame seeds, sprinkle some on top.", "Does he like the taste of balsamic?

{"title": "Planning Food Shopping For Recipes", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI found it problematic to do online food shopping for recipes for shops and this weekend I decided to take my spin on the problem. I thought I'd show what I've got before committing further.\n\nThe idea is that you could pick out recipes, then tune the ingredients and then proceed to their preferred shopping cart pre-filled.\n\n[Here's a mockup](http://print-pnb.rhcloud.com/) of how I'd imagine streamlining shopping with recipes in mind.\n\nWhat would be the ways to make this more convenient? Are you interested in this type of application (maybe making an iPhone app based on that)?\n\nP.S. Sorry, I didn't add a lot of recipes, ingredients, nutrition facts - I want to know what you think first.
