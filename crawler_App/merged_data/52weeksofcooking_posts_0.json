Man, I was wrong - I really enjoyed this week. Cruciferous had me stumped for a bit until I recalled a post from u/Misuro where they did a Thai Glass Noodle Salad with a similar red cabbage cabbage meets acid color-changing technique and I started researching similar recipes. Actually, Misuro\u2019s dish was one of the original reasons I decided to do 52WOC. After a bit of time I stumbled upon two that I thought \u201cHey, I\u2019d really enjoy eating THAT!\u201d and combined them together to make - well, something I really enjoyed cooking and eating! And may also be the brightest, hardest to capture a picture of the true vibrancy, dish I\u2019ve ever made. Enjoy! :) \n\nRainbow Glass Noodle Salad with Red Cabbage Slaw: https://www.kitchenstories.com/en/recipes/rainbow-glass-noodle-salad-with-tofu-and-red-cabbage-slaw\n\n(I omitted the tofu for this dish so I could add in the General Tso\u2019s. Nothing against tofu, which I actually enjoy.

She wanted to eat rocks. I can do something with that!\n\nI ended up researching different ways to make edible rocks for hours on end, and eventually ended up finding [this recipe](https://reportergourmet.com/en/news/5896-the-edible-stones-that-stunned-the-world-mugaritz-s-recipe). Edible rocks!\n\nFunny story; when trying to source the kaolin clay I kept finding stores that only sold it in massive quantities, and I only needed a few grams.. Eventually I came across a pet food supplement store that sold smaller quantities, so I had to get it from there. Feels weird to cook with something labeled as pet food, but it's pharmaceutical grade and safe to consume by humans. \n\nI tried making the aioli in the recipe as well, but emulsification is my arch nemesis. Ended up just eating these with BBQ sauce. The shell doesn't do a whole lot flavour wise, but it does add an interesting texture and mouth feel.

{"title": "Week 16: Battered - Citrus Birthday Cake", "selftext": "This is my birthday cake for this year, I\u2019ll start by saying that I feel like this is a bit of a cop out by me because I was always going to bake myself a cake, but the theme was announced just before I decided on what I was going to bake...and I definitely did make a cake batter...\nand I have done an awful lot of deep frying lately... Usually I get inspiration from the theme but this time the theme has taken inspiration from the day of my birth!\n\nBecause my birthday is right at the beginning of Spring, I am always drawn to flavours and decoration that represent the change of season. I have always loved citrus in desserts, and it felt right for the warmer weather. I thought it would be fun to celebrate all kinds of citrus all in one cake and took ideas from [this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/6-inch-citrus-cake/) which uses mixed zest and juice into the batter, I doubled the cake recipe and baked it in two 9-inch tins. I managed to find lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit and blood oranges at the supermarket, and I thought it would be fun to make each one into a different curd. [This](https://buttermilkbysam.com/the-best-lemon-curd/) is my favourite lemon curd recipe because it has a lot of lemon juice and zest so it\u2019s extra tangy, and also uses whole eggs so there is no faff with separating yolks, you just sieve any bits out at the end to give a silky texture. I made a small batch of this recipe 5 times, just changing the citrus each time to get 5 different curds. I realised my lemon, lime and orange curd all looked pretty much identical so I added a few drops of food colouring so I could identify each curd more easily. I was going for pastel colours but it's ended up more neon but hey at least they look different!\n\nI cut my cakes into thirds to get 6 layers in total, then layered up with [stabilised whipped cream](https://livslittlemuffins.com/stabilized-whipped-cream/) and curd. I kept the decoration pretty simple because there\u2019s a lot going on inside, so did a naked style cake with some extra cream on top, then finished with slices of all the different citrus fruits. I loved the way this recipe came together, I used all the leftover zest and juice from making the curds in the cake batter so was left with no wasted fruit! It was also my first time making most of these curds and I really liked them all - grapefruit is a new favourite!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0keor", "created_utc": 1744810040.0, "score": 444, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 51, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k0keor/week_16_battered_citrus_birthday_cake/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Week 10: Rice - Tumpeng", "selftext": "This week I made a celebratory Indonesian dish called Tumpeng which is a cone of rice surrounded by side dishes. The dish is full of philosophical and religious symbolism: making the rice cone is supposed to represent the idea that you get stronger as you mature, as the rice only becomes stable in the mould using pressure and leaving it for some time. It is also thought to be pointing skyward towards God and also represents the mountains of the country, with the side dishes representing flora and fauna.\n\nThe version I made is called Tumpeng Nasi Kuning so the [rice](https://www.cookmeindonesian.com/nasi-kuning-yellow-rice-vegan/) is coloured yellow to symbolise prosperity, and flavoured with turmeric, lemongrass, pandan leaf, kaffir lime leaf and coconut milk. There were two dishes using an interesting marination technique that I hadn't tried before: [ayam bakar](https://www.cookmeindonesian.com/ayam-bakar-solo-solonese-grilled-chicken/) which is chicken that is first braised in loads of ingredients (including some that were new to me like candlenuts and salam leaf), then left to marinate and then grilled. A similar technique is also used on the [telur pindang](https://whattocooktoday.com/telur-pindang.html) - marinated marbled eggs. I also made [perkedel](https://whattocooktoday.com/perkedel-kentang-potato-fritters.html) (mashed potato fritters), [tempe orek](https://muchbutter.com/authentic-indonesian-tempeh-orek/)(stir fried tempeh), [urap sayur](https://cinnamonsnail.com/urap-sayur-salad/)(green beans, beansprouts and spinach topped with a toasted coconut dressing) and [sambal terasi](https://whattocooktoday.com/sambal-terasi.html)(shrimp paste chilli sauce).\n\nThis was lots of fun to make and really interesting to research.

{"title": "Week 4: Cruciferous - Banchan", "selftext": "I love cruciferous vegetables, they are so versatile and delicious, so when this theme was announced I had a bit of a hard time trying to find a dish that \u2018did justice\u2019 to these wonderful vegetables. I use a lot of qualifying vegetables in everyday cooking (Chinese leaf was my most frequent purchased item from my local Sainsbury\u2019s last year) but I really wanted to cook something that celebrated a variety of different cruciferous vegetables in different preparations, rather than simply use one or two as an ingredient. So I asked in the Discord and a few people suggested banchan \u2013 Korean side dishes served alongside steamed rice.\n\nSo, this is my celebration of all things cruciferous in banchan form, starring broccoli, cabbage, pak choi, mustard leaves, daikon and of course, Chinese leaf (Napa cabbage). Going clockwise from top left, we have:\n\n- [gat-kimchi \uac13\uae40\uce58](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/gat-kimchi) (mustard greens kimchi)\n- [ssam-mu \uc308\ubb34](https://mykoreankitchen.com/pickled-radish-paper/) (pickled radish)\n- [musaengchae \ubb34\uc0dd\ucc44](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/musaengchae) (radish salad)\n- [baechu-doenjangguk \ubc30\ucd94\ub41c\uc7a5\uad6d](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/baechu-doenjang-guk) (soybean paste soup with Chinese leaf)\n- [cheonggyeongchae doenjang-muchim \uccad\uacbd\ucc44 \ub41c\uc7a5\ubb34\uce68](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/bok-choy-muchim) (pak choi with soybean paste)\n- [broccoli dubu-muchim \ube0c\ub85c\ucf5c\ub9ac \ub450\ubd80\ubb34\uce68](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/broccoli-dubu-muchim) (broccoli with tofu)\n- steamed rice\n- [yangbaechu-pickle \uc591\ubc30\ucd94\ud53c\ud074](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/yangbaechu-pickle) (cabbage pickle)\n- [baechujeon \ubc30\ucd94\uc804](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/baechujeon) (Chinese leaf pancake)\n\nThis was all so tasty and nutritious, and would be vegan apart from some dried anchovies in the baechu-doenjangguka and fish sauce in the gat-kimchi. We had a feast for one night and then I took very exciting leftovers into work for the rest of the week. My absolute favourite was the baechujeon \u2013 I could not believe how something so simple could be so delicious.\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/tvzl2gqt2jee1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1737544182.0, "score": 334, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 41, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1i78rae/week_4_cruciferous_banchan/", "html_title": ""}

I'm still a fan of the games and get excited for every new game. \n\nAs soon as this theme was announced, I knew I wanted to make something related to Pok\u00e9mon. I follow u/miscellaneousmao on Instagram and Reddit, she makes absolutely incredible Pok\u00e9mon desserts and cake pops, but I didn't think I'd have the time or skill level to replicate most of what she makes. I was stalling for a bit when thinking exactly what I'd do, so I made my caramelising dish first and found myself with a whole load of extra cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re, and then I saw this [Gengar cake cup](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBohQ8NpObx/?igsh=MXh2a294eDB6dnZ5dA==) and thought I could have a go! \n\nI used ube extract to colour and flavour my cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re, and made a [microwave mug cake](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/microwave-mug-cake) and then realised that I didn't have any white chocolate or candy melts to make Gengar's features. I did have icing sugar though, and I decided to give it a go with just basic icing sugar + water + food colouring. I piped the details, left it to dry for a few hours and then realised my mistake as soon as I tried to pipe the cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re in. Obviously the reason that you use candy melts is because they are not water soluble... I decided to carry on and made up the cake cup, layering cake and cream and sculpting cake for the ears, and you can see my cursed creation in the second and third pictures... Time was not kind to poor cursed Gengar. \n\nI still had cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re and mug cake leftover, so I bought white chocolate and oil based food colouring and had another go. I could see my cream had lost some of its structure so I went with ice cream cones for the ears this time, and it worked out in the end. It tasted OK but a bit too sweet and not super well balanced, but I was finally happy with the look. Quite apt that this dessert was so cursed!

It was such a memorable dish, really rich but absolutely delicious. As soon as this theme was announced, my mind went to fresh pasta because I've never made it before and I got a pasta machine as a Christmas present. I looked up the Bancone dish and to my surprise I found [the whole recipe](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/silk-handkerchiefs-recipe), shared by Ben Waugh, the executive chef at Bancone. I hadn't planned to attempt the whole dish though, because that was three whole elements that I'd never made before, so triple the intimidation! But I thought about it and realised it was obviously perfect for this theme, so I just went for it.\n\nI first started pasta dough, because this recipe has you chill it for 2 hours. That was easy enough, so I turned to the confit egg yolk. They were also not too difficult, they just slowly cook in a bath of oil on a low heat in the oven. The beurre blanc was also not too scary but did require white balsamic (delicious and well worth it IMO) and a whole block of butter. The hardest part of the dish was using my pasta machine - it was a bit of a learning curve but I managed OK in the end!\n\nThe actual hardest part was plating. First on the plate is beurre blanc and chopped walnuts, then folded silk handkerchiefs, more beurre blanc, then a few more walnuts, the confit egg yolk and a dusting of parmesan. Luckily I made spare confit yolks because I broke half of them in the journey between oil and plate!\n\nThis dish was just as good as I remember, and it's a great example of how far I've come in my cooking journey. I really enjoyed all aspects of this challenge and have since made fresh pasta again because it was kind of revolutionary for me!

I knew I had to do it. \n\nI constructed Frylock from a tuna can box because I didn\u2019t have a fry container on hand, then I got into the art supplies to pull together the other elements. Shake is just construction paper wrapped around a white coffee mug. His pink straw is pink paper wrapped around a metal straw. Absolutely janky.

He was also filled with blood in another one, so I honestly felt it was open to interpretation. Frylock is hand cut twice-fried fries. Meatwad is a 1/2 lb baked Italian meatball. I did make a total of four meatballs - the other three got covered in a spicy red sauce. \n\nWas it weird eating literally a meatball, fries, and a shake for dinner? Yes.

{"title": "Week 5: Aotearoa - Afghans and Anzac Biscuits", "selftext": "I loved doing 52 Weeks of Baking last year but found it a bit too much to juggle with 52 Weeks of Cooking as well as my own cooking challenge club in school. I now feel a little bit less guilty going down the sweet route for 52 Weeks of Cooking themes when recipes scream out \"cook me!\" and that's what happened this week.\n\nI'd seen Anzac biscuits when researching baking themes last year and they sounded great, so were on my to-bake list. This felt like the perfect time. I followed [this recipe](https://cloudykitchen.com/blog/anzac-biscuits/) which is pretty traditional but browns the butter first which adds a lovely depth of flavour. These biscuits are named after the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and were sent in care packages which needed to travel well, so don't use eggs and instead used melted golden syrup and butter to bind oats, sugar, flour and desiccated coconut. \n\nI also made [Afghans](https://cloudykitchen.com/blog/2016-6-8-afghans/), which are a chocolate and cornflake biscuit, topped with chocolate icing and a walnut. The origins of the name are unclear, and perhaps refer to the shape of a traditional Afghan hat, or the craggy landscape of Afghanistan. The alternative could also be rooted in racism, and so one manufacturer has changed the name of the product to \"Milk Chocolate Roughs\". Whatever the name, these were yummy! \n\nBoth were excellent but the Anzac biscuits were spectacular. Everyone loved them and we were all disappointed when they ran out.

{"title": "Week 9: Caramelising - Croquembouche", "selftext": "I was completely inspired by the wonderful croquembouche that u/thenickdyer made for the \"A Technique You're Intimidated By\" week. This gave me the perfect excuse to attempt something that I'd previously rejected for one of the themes last year for being \"too difficult\", which shows me how much my attitude towards difficult baking has changed!\n\nCroquembouche is a tower of filled choux buns, and its name means \"crunch in mouth\". It is a popular centrepiece at French weddings, and they can be so beautiful and dramatic when done properly! I am happy with mine for a first attempt, but I definitely have a few areas to improve upon. \n\nI filled my choux buns with lemon cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re (cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re lightened with whipped cream, that I flavoured with lemon curd) and then made caramel to dip the buns in, then to stick the buns together and then to make into sugar strands to wrap around the croquembouche. I decorated with orange blossom flowers and gold leaf for extra fancy. \n\nIt was all going okay until I accidentally dropped a caramel covered choux bun onto my hand. It hurt (a lot) but I didn't realise quite how bad it was until the next day when it blistered badly and I had to go to hospital to get my burns dressed...\n\nThis is a bit smaller than I intended because my hand was hurting and my caramel was a bit too thick, which also made it a bit too \"crunch in mouth\" but it was a very tasty dessert!

{"title": "2023 Weekly Challenge List", "selftext": "So, historically in this subreddit we only counted streaks provided the participant submitted each dish *during that week*, with leeway given on request but pretty liberally. Back at the start of COVID we put in a temporary measure to help preserve streaks - so long as you posted a dish within the three week time limit it counted. In 2023 we will be phasing this out.\n\nStarting with Week 1 of 2023, participants have two weeks after the end of that week to post their dish to count for consecutive streaks. (ie, Week 1 must be posted by the end of Week 3)\n\nStarting with Week 14, dishes must be posted by the end of the following week (Week 14 must be posted by the end of Week 15)\n\nStarting with Week 27, dishes must be posted by the end of that week. Same as it ever was. \n \nSo anyway, on with the fun stuff! \n \n#/r/52weeksofcooking is a way for each participant to challenge themselves to cook something different each week. The technicalities of each week's theme are largely unimportant, and are always open to interpretation. Basically, if you can make an argument for your dish being relevant to the theme, then it's fine.\n\n- [Week 1: January 1 - January 7: Rainy Day](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/101hm80/week_1_introduction_thread_rainy_day/?)\n- [Week 2: January 8 -

While there\u2019s no official data linking Garfield\u2019s debut directly to a spike in lasagna sales, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that this lazy, lasagna-obsessed tabby cat became a food icon. If Garfield loved it, then surely everyone else would too, right? It\u2019s likely that many people saw Garfield devouring plate after plate and thought, \"Maybe I should try this lasagna thing.\"\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about lasagna\u2019s unofficial link to Mondays. Have you ever noticed that people tend to serve lasagna on Mondays? Garfield would approve\u2014after all, it\u2019s a comforting dish to ease you into the week. Who wants to deal with sad salads or boring sandwiches when you could dive into a hearty, cheesy serving of lasagna to kickstart your week? It\u2019s like Garfield knew that Mondays needed some extra love in the form of carbs and cheese.\n\nIn the end, Garfield didn\u2019t just entertain us\u2014he made lasagna cool. The comic helped keep the dish front and center in pop culture, and it\u2019s no surprise that more people probably turned to lasagna after seeing that orange tabby enjoying it. So, whether it\u2019s a Monday or any day of the week, if Garfield was around, I\u2019d bet he\u2019d still be reminding us to enjoy a big plate of lasagna.

Basically, if you can make an argument for your dish being relevant to the theme, then it's fine.**\n\n* [Week 1: January 1st - January 7th: Hindsight 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/eit5fg/week_1_introduction_thread_hindsight_2020/)\n* [Week 2: January 8th - January 14th: Miso](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/em3ute/week_2_introduction_post_miso/)\n* [Week 3: January 15th - January 21st: Russian](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/ep75gp/week_3_introduction_thread_russian/)\n* [Week 4: January 22nd - January 28th: 24 Hours](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/eshfio/week_4_introduction_thread_24_hours/)\n* [Week 5: January 29th - February 4th: Rice](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/ewb1bo/week_5_introduction_thread_rice/)\n* [Week 6: February 5th - February 11th: Jamaican](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/ezv6lm/week_6_introduction_thread_jamaican)\n* [Week 7: February 12th - February 18th: Braising](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/f3eiar/week_7_introduction_thread_braising/)\n* [Week 8: February 19th - February 25th: Used to Dislike](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/f69y64/week_8_introduction_thread_used_to_dislike/)\n* [Week 9: February 26th - March 3rd: Brazilian](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/f9zghp/week_9_introduction_thread_brazilian/)\n* [Week 10: March 4th - March 10th: Fermented](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/feq531/week_10_introduction_thread_fermented/)\n* [Week 11: March 11th - March 17th: Kawaii](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/fgxvo0/week_11_introduction_thread_kawaii/)\n* [Week 12: March 18th - March 24th: Peppers](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/fknpev/week_12_introduction_thread_peppers/)\n* [Week 13: March 25th - March 31st: Deep Frying](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/foj9ll/week_13_introduction_thread_deep_frying/)\n* [Week 14: April 1st - April 7th: Alphabet](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/ftmrro/week_14_introduction_thread_alphabet/)\n* [Week 15: April 8th - April 14th: Beans](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/fxvmdh/week_15_introduction_thread_beans/)\n* [Week 16: April 15th - April 21st: South African](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/g1pye0/week_16_introduction_thread_south_african/)\n* [Week 17: April 22nd - April 28th: From Scratch](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/g63bi1/week_17_introduction_thread_from_scratch/)\n* [Week 18: April 29th - May 5th: Ginger](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/gbarg6/week_18_introduction_thread_ginger/)\n* [Week 19: May 6th - May 12th: Sri Lankan](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/geua1w/week_19_introduction_thread_sri_lankan/)\n* [Week 20: May 13th - May 19th: Puree](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/gj0r6o/week_20_introduction_thread_pur%C3%A9e/)\n* [Week 21: May 20th - May 26th: Flour](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/gouqc4/week_21_introduction_thread_flour)\n* [Week 22: May 27th - June 2nd: Nepalese](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/gsn7sp/week_22_introduction_thread_nepalese/)\n* [Week 23: June 3rd - June 9th: Crunchy](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/gx5drz/week_23_introduction_thread_crunchy/)\n* [Week 24: June 10th - June 16th: Black and White](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/h08tkx/week_24_introduction_thread_black_and_white/)\n* Week 25: June 17th - June 23rd: Australasian\n* Week 26: June 24th - June 30th: Proofing\n* Week 27: July 1st - July 7th: Retro Recipes\n\n[Continued...](https://old.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/hbpngh/2020_weekly_challenge_list/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/e9oxx0/2020_weekly_challenge_list/", "created_utc": 1576164240.0, "score": 238, "author": "Marx0r", "num_comments": 463, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/e9oxx0/2020_weekly_challenge_list/", "html_title": ""}

Next time I'd probably bake the dough on its own for a bit before filling it, just because the top of the dough could have been cooked more. The bottom is crisp and firm, and it can be cut easily, so it's really not raw, but I think that would improve it. \n\nI needed a whole zucchini, half an eggplant, 4 small tomatoes and one green onion. I used something like 2 tablespoons of tomato paste on the bottom, some soy sauce, Mediterranean spices and herbs, black pepper. Over the veggies I sprinkled some salt and evoo. After it was down I added some feta and green onion.

{"title": "Week 18 - Taiwanese:  Imperial Fried Chicken, Golden Sesame Caesar, Milk Bun w/ Shrimp Cake & Rousung (Recipes from Win Son Restaurant)", "selftext": "My dishes for this week come from Win Son Presents A Taiwanese American Cookbook, a collection of recipes from Josh Ku\u2019s and Trigg Brown\u2019s Win Son Restaurant and Bakery in New York City.\n\nI love a Caesar salad, good or bad. If there is a Caesar, I will always order it. When I saw a recipe for Win Son\u2019s Golden Sesame Caesar Salad, I knew I\u2019d be planning my meal around that. The Kewpie mayo-based dressing has a nice hit of golden sesame paste and the salad is topped with some MSG-spiked panko bread crumbs, crispy fried shallots, and sesame seeds. It was delightful\u2014 recognizably Caesar with a twist. \n\nI haven\u2019t always loved chicken wings. But after years of eating an obligatory wing when my husband would order them, I\u2019m a convert. Fittingly, Win Son\u2019s recipe for Imperial Chicken wasn\u2019t my first choice, but something kept luring me back. The chicken wings marinate in a buttermilk, scallion, and 5-spice (and many other ingredients) mixture before being dredged in flour, sweet potato starch, and corn starch. After a quick fry, they\u2019re doused in a sticky-sweet-earthy imperial sauce and scallions. \n\nAnd then a sandwich because why not? I made milk buns and folded in some scallions, then packed them with homemade shrimp cakes, a fluffy nest of pork floss, and Win Son\u2019s zippy Ginger Deluxe Sauce. (And more scallions.)\n\nDinner was great. Cooking was chaos. The cookbook has the grease splatters to commemorate it. \n\nImperial Fried Chicken:\n\nhttps://coolfooddude.com/2023/04/08/fried-chicken-with-imperial-sauce/\n\nThis link has the milk bun and the ginger sauce recipes:\nhttps://bonabbetit.com/milk-buns-breakfast-sandwich/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdyptr", "created_utc": 1746294423.0, "score": 12, "author": "MildPrompter", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1kdyptr/week_18_taiwanese_imperial_fried_chicken_golden/", "html_title": ""}

I decided to cook four dishes that intrigued me or appealed to me the most, and seemed doable at home. Unfortunately, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make possibly the best named food I\u2019ve ever come across: Dachang Bao Xiaochang (\u5927\u8178\u5305\u5c0f\u8178) which translates as Small Sausage in Large Sausage as it was just too much work, but I decided to go with:\n\n- [ba wan \u8089\u5713](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0043/4490/5828/files/Crystal_Meatball.pdf?v=1695218423): crystal skin dumplings\n- [yan su ji \u9e79\u9165\u96de](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/taiwanese-salt-and-pepper-chicken-yan-su-ji/): Taiwanese popcorn chicken\n- [zhu xie gao \u8c6c\u8840\u7cd5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjN7hYi6xKA&pp=ygUVcGlnIGJsb29kIGNha2UgcmVjaXBl0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv): pig blood cake\n- [tie dan \u9435\u86cb](https://www.thehongkongcookery.com/2022/01/chinese-iron-eggs.html): iron eggs\n- [Haishan sauce \u6d77\u5c71\u91ac](https://yunhai.shop/blogs/recipes/oyster-omelets-%E8%9A%B5%E4%BB%94%E7%85%8E?srsltid=AfmBOopcGqSNsyyzIADv_rFtyyr8GFFLzu5USTNfxn0nqHKW4EbgtQQe)\n- [garlic thick soy sauce \u849c\u84c9\u91ac\u6cb9\u818f](https://cookinginchinglish.com/taiwanese-thick-soy-sauce/)\n\nThe ba wan were the most complicated as they involved making a dough out rice flour, sweet potato starch, tapioca starch and water as well as a pork filling. The dough is really sticky so the recipe recommends using small bowls to first spread a thin layer of dough into, then scoop a ball of filling, then seal with more dough. This did work well but I didn't quite grease the bowls properly so not all of my dumplings came out well. These are often served with coriander and the Haishan and garlic thick soy sauce. These were absolutely delicious and even the ones that didn't look so pretty still tasted great. \n\nI chose the pig blood cake because that was pretty far out of my comfort zone and I do really love black pudding. It's only made with pig blood, glutinous rice and salt, which is then steamed. I really doubted it would work out but it set up perfectly! Traditionally these are dipped into peanut powder and coriander. I really enjoyed these, reminiscent of black pudding but with a much bouncier texture.\n\nThe popcorn chicken were very much in my comfort zone, and I particularly liked this recipe. The marinade gave the chicken so much flavour, and the sweet potato starch gave a really crunchy coating. This has deep fried basil leaves which went unexpectedly really well with the chicken, although I definitely added way too many into my deep frying oil at once, it nearly bubbled over and terrified myself! \n\nThe iron eggs are similar to other soy-marinated eggs, except you simmer and cool the eggs multiple times which makes the eggs shrink and changes the texture. Supposedly this dish was invented when a vendor hadn't sold the eggs from the previous day, so she had to continually reheat them. These were the only miss of this meal, they were too salty for me and I much prefer a softer yolk.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/c0u8kxbgd0ye1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1746034650.0, "score": 77, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1kbmfvw/week_18_taiwanese_night_market_ba_wan_\u8089\u5713_yan_su/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Week 17: On Sale - Parmesan Crusted Turkey Breast and Creamy Vodka Pasta (Meta: From My Garden)", "selftext": "Any resemblance to last week's post is purely coincidental. Ahem.\n\nEvery November for Thanksgiving my favorite grocery store (HEB) has a sale where if you buy a ham, you get an 11 pound turkey for free. Anything above 11 you pay like $1.20 a pound for. I buy an insane amount of ham for my breakfast kolaches, so I ended up with a lot of turkeys last fall! I thawed them and broke them down and refroze the pieces. This was the last of the breast meat. I treated it exactly like I would for chicken parmesan - butterflied, salted, then a coating of flour and garlic powder, then eggs, then a coating of panko, parmesan, garlic powder and parsley flakes.\n\nThe vodka pasta was new to me and is something I've wanted to try for a long time. I don't drink but I will cook with alcohol, and I had to make a stop at a liquor store to buy a small bottle of vodka. That was an amusing interaction. The reason I decided on this recipe for this week's theme (and there were so many options because I buy a lot of meat on sale) was that Brian Lagerstrom just posted a video for this sauce that uses Calabrian chilis. I bought those for a theme last year and haven't touched them since, so it was great to get some more use out of them! The pasta was awesome, if spicy (#SpiceWimp) and I will absolutely make it again!\n\nFor my meta, I harvested fresh parsley from my garden.

{"title": "Week 17: On Sale - Duck \u00e0 l'Orange", "selftext": "My local supermarket had baskets full of flowers on sale the week after Mother\u2019s Day, with loads of daffodils. I picked up three bunches, which were reduced from over \u00a312 in total to about \u00a32.50. The theme had just been announced so I hoped I could use the daffodils in some way in my dish. Unfortunately, when I came to researching it turns out that daffodils contain lycorine so are highly toxic and are absolutely not safe for consumption. After a couple of days my daffodils had all opened and looked beautiful, but I was about to go on holiday so thought about using them in a decorative way for my dish for this theme, to give them one last hurrah before they had to be binned.\n\nI found a whole duck on offer and so instantly thought of Duck \u00e0 l'Orange because I had quite a few spare oranges leftover from my citrus cake. I almost made [this Jacques P\u00e9pin recipe](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/duck-lorange) for week 1 this year, but chose something else as I couldn\u2019t find duck very cheaply, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try this recipe out. The duck is roasted and then the recipe calls for making a duck gravy from the neck and gizzards along with some vegetables, aromatics, stock and wine. This is then added to an orange syrup with vinegar, redcurrant jelly and butter, which makes for a really shiny, deeply flavoured sauce. I decided that only using pantry ingredients (except for the duck) felt in the spirit of this theme, so I used only the vegetables I had on hand (so missed the celery and leek) as well as omitting the Grand Marnier, and served with roast potatoes and broccoli.\n\nI made a kind of floral wreath to decorate my duck and sauce, taking care not to let the daffodils touch any of the food. I really liked this dish, the sauce is sweet and savoury and pairs so well with the duck. Duck is probably my favourite meat so I\u2019m delighted to find another way to make it! \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/f1dxqwu2rkwe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745409700.0, "score": 160, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k5xdo9/week_17_on_sale_duck_\u00e0_lorange/", "html_title": ""}

This helps to add extra veggies and fiber to your diet and kind of gets it out of the way so you can focus on enjoying your actual lunch or dinner or whatever. She generally starts these videos by saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re watching this, it\u2019s dinosaur time.\u201d She often includes on-screen text with dinosaur facts to read while she eats. Toward the end of her videos, she shares what her actual meal will be, while reminding us that \u201cdinosaur time is not a meal replacement.\u201d Her content is wholesome, it\u2019s creative, it\u2019s healthy. Obviously, it was perfect for this week\u2019s challenge.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn\u2019t think I could justify this week\u2019s challenge with just a handful of plain greens \ud83d\ude02 So, I looked to one of her non-dinosaur time videos where she made Agua de Pepino (kind of like a cucumber slushie with lemon juice and sugar).

Something was there, just around the corner. I couldn\u2019t see it, but I could feel it\u2014something big, something dangerous. I strained my eyes, trying to make out the shape lurking in the shadows. Glowing eyes reflected the dim light from outside. Is it a dinosaur? The thought hit me like a cold wave. Could something that ancient be here, now?\n\nThe creature moved again, and I froze. It was long, sleek, and its tail swished, almost too smoothly. The claws scraped the floor, and my breath caught in my throat. Every instinct screamed at me to turn and run, but I had to know what it was. I took a careful step forward, my hands tightening on the broom.\n\nThen, it stepped into the dim light, and my blood ran cold. It wasn\u2019t a dinosaur at all. It was a massive alligator. Its scales glistened in the low light, and its cold eyes locked onto mine. The claws, the tail\u2014all made sense now. My grip on the broom loosened, but I didn\u2019t dare move. There was nothing prehistoric about it\u2014but it was just as terrifying.\n\nNow if you'd like to make your own alligator tendies, keep reading!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/8mon5vnpu9we1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745277719.0, "score": 13, "author": "4_the_love_of_cheese", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k4rs9c/week_14_dinosaurs_alligator_tenders/", "html_title": ""}

I saw lots of inspiration throughout the week. My wife ended up suggesting mofongo as one of her favorites and it was a dish I hadn't had yet which pushed for my attempt. Mofongo is essentially mashed plantains. I haven't actually fried plantains but it was quick and easy to do. I heated up the electric skillet outdoors to avoid all of the oil splatter that typically comes with frying. The challenging part for this dish was using a mortar and pestle to mash garlic, salt, pork rinds, and the fried plantains by hand. I don't have a masher so it took a bit of timer using this technique. My first serving came out a bit salty with the salted pork rinds. I pulled back a bit on the salt on the second serving but went too heavy on the garlic. \n\nOriginally, I was going to serve my mofongo with a chicken broth. However, the wife also wanted Jamaican jerk chicken this week for meal prep. The chicken was ready to go when I had completed the Puerto Rican dish so we had them together. Excellent combination! Overall, I enjoyed mofongo, it was incredibly easy to make! It left me curious - should I fry a mofongo patty next time?

It\u2019s also the most time intensive with a couple of nested recipes for carrot syrup and raspberry jam, although they were both fairly simple to make. The frosting was mousse like\u2014 a freshly whipped cream folded into a classic cream cheese frosting. \n\nSecond place was a tie between Claire Saffitz and Nancy Silverton. Both had a nutty rich brown butter cream cheese frosting. Claire\u2019s had pecans and no dried fruit and was more a classic cake and Nancy\u2019s had roasted carrots and walnuts (it was also a more time intensive cake) and was a spicier richer cake. \n\nThe Zoe Bakes cake had coconut. I love coconut cake but did not care for it personally in carrot cake the texture was chewy and dry, it was unanimously our least favorite. The orange zest in like was lovely though. The frosting was flavored with lemon extract and lemon juice.\n\nThe lobster was flavored simply by its tomalley and a pinch of curry powder and lemon zest.  \n\nThe bunuelo was a mixture of feta cheese, sugar, salt, baking powder, wheat flour and corn flour, then deep fried.

{"title": "Week 16: Battered - Citrus Birthday Cake", "selftext": "This is my birthday cake for this year, I\u2019ll start by saying that I feel like this is a bit of a cop out by me because I was always going to bake myself a cake, but the theme was announced just before I decided on what I was going to bake...and I definitely did make a cake batter...\nand I have done an awful lot of deep frying lately... Usually I get inspiration from the theme but this time the theme has taken inspiration from the day of my birth!\n\nBecause my birthday is right at the beginning of Spring, I am always drawn to flavours and decoration that represent the change of season. I have always loved citrus in desserts, and it felt right for the warmer weather. I thought it would be fun to celebrate all kinds of citrus all in one cake and took ideas from [this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/6-inch-citrus-cake/) which uses mixed zest and juice into the batter, I doubled the cake recipe and baked it in two 9-inch tins. I managed to find lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit and blood oranges at the supermarket, and I thought it would be fun to make each one into a different curd. [This](https://buttermilkbysam.com/the-best-lemon-curd/) is my favourite lemon curd recipe because it has a lot of lemon juice and zest so it\u2019s extra tangy, and also uses whole eggs so there is no faff with separating yolks, you just sieve any bits out at the end to give a silky texture. I made a small batch of this recipe 5 times, just changing the citrus each time to get 5 different curds. I realised my lemon, lime and orange curd all looked pretty much identical so I added a few drops of food colouring so I could identify each curd more easily. I was going for pastel colours but it's ended up more neon but hey at least they look different!\n\nI cut my cakes into thirds to get 6 layers in total, then layered up with [stabilised whipped cream](https://livslittlemuffins.com/stabilized-whipped-cream/) and curd. I kept the decoration pretty simple because there\u2019s a lot going on inside, so did a naked style cake with some extra cream on top, then finished with slices of all the different citrus fruits. I loved the way this recipe came together, I used all the leftover zest and juice from making the curds in the cake batter so was left with no wasted fruit! It was also my first time making most of these curds and I really liked them all - grapefruit is a new favourite!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0keor", "created_utc": 1744810040.0, "score": 447, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 51, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k0keor/week_16_battered_citrus_birthday_cake/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Most of his videos don't have super strict recipes, per se \u2013\u00a0he'll just show the process of how he makes a dish, usually improvising based on what he has available in his pantry. He's also really honest (as near as I can tell) about how the dishes turn out \u2013\u00a0sometimes he'll say they're really good; other times he'll acknowledge that he should have done something differently along the way.\n\nFor his \\[orecchiette video\\](https://www.tiktok.com/@deanbosko/video/7483368909593136415?lang=en), he did actually share the measurements for the pasta dough \u2013\u00a0at least in terms of the water:semolina ratio, which is 1:2. He also mentioned using salt in the dough but didn't specify an amount, so for that I just used what I thought would be a sensible amount.\n\nI paired my orecchiette with an improvised sun-dried tomato and pumpkin seed pesto. This isn't the sauce he used (his involved anchovies and some other things), but it was definitely inspired by his approach to prioritizing an understanding of ingredients and their purpose (instead of always just straight-up following a recipe) to create balanced, tasty dishes. And in his same spirit of post-meal disclosure, my pasta was tasty but a little too firm \u2013\u00a0hopefully I can figure out how to make it ever so slightly more tender in the future.

The smell of charred chiles and cooking tortillas and the sound of a wooden pestle pounding against a kruk would escort you on your evening walks home.

Alongside the pernil, I made Maisonet\u2019s Nina DeeDee\u2019s Beans (white beans strewed with garlic and onion, then finished with Monterey Jack cheese), green rice (with cilantro and jalape\u00f1o), and host of condiments (spicy green sauce, mayoketchup, and some quick pickled shallots.)

It's marinaded overnight with a mixture of blended garlic, fresh oregano, salt, pepper and adobo seasoning, and then it cooks slowly at about 140\u00b0C for 5 hours before turning up high to make the cuerito - the crispy skin. I used [this recipe](https://youtu.be/1V6HIGf64bA?feature=shared) and followed a tip in the comments to wrap in parchment paper before wrapping in foil so that the foil wouldn't stick to the skin but would trap all the moisture inside during the slow cooking portion of the cooking time. \n\nTo accompany the pernil I made [arroz con gandules](https://www.delishdlites.com/occasion/holiday-recipes/arroz-con-gandules-puerto-rican-rice-with-pigeon-peas-recipe/) (rice with pigeon peas), [tostones](https://salimaskitchen.com/tostones/) (twice fried plantain) and avocado. \n\nThe meat was easily the star of the show, meltingly tender with excellent crunchy crackling. The arroz con gandules was delicious as well, packed full of flavour and texture. The pigeon peas were hard to find but I did manage to source a tin of cooked ones, they were good but I don't think I would've noticed a huge deal if I had substituted them for lentils. I really liked the dish as a whole but I did find it a bit rich. When I had leftovers I made a salad with a tangy citrus dressing which went really nicely. I'm definitely making the pork again soon.

If there is a Caesar, I will always order it. When I saw a recipe for Win Son\u2019s Golden Sesame Caesar Salad, I knew I\u2019d be planning my meal around that. The Kewpie mayo-based dressing has a nice hit of golden sesame paste and the salad is topped with some MSG-spiked panko bread crumbs, crispy fried shallots, and sesame seeds. It was delightful\u2014 recognizably Caesar with a twist. \n\nI haven\u2019t always loved chicken wings. But after years of eating an obligatory wing when my husband would order them, I\u2019m a convert. Fittingly, Win Son\u2019s recipe for Imperial Chicken wasn\u2019t my first choice, but something kept luring me back. The chicken wings marinate in a buttermilk, scallion, and 5-spice (and many other ingredients) mixture before being dredged in flour, sweet potato starch, and corn starch. After a quick fry, they\u2019re doused in a sticky-sweet-earthy imperial sauce and scallions. \n\nAnd then a sandwich because why not? I made milk buns and folded in some scallions, then packed them with homemade shrimp cakes, a fluffy nest of pork floss, and Win Son\u2019s zippy Ginger Deluxe Sauce. (And more scallions.)\n\nDinner was great. Cooking was chaos.

I decided to cook four dishes that intrigued me or appealed to me the most, and seemed doable at home. Unfortunately, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make possibly the best named food I\u2019ve ever come across: Dachang Bao Xiaochang (\u5927\u8178\u5305\u5c0f\u8178) which translates as Small Sausage in Large Sausage as it was just too much work, but I decided to go with:\n\n- [ba wan \u8089\u5713](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0043/4490/5828/files/Crystal_Meatball.pdf?v=1695218423): crystal skin dumplings\n- [yan su ji \u9e79\u9165\u96de](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/taiwanese-salt-and-pepper-chicken-yan-su-ji/): Taiwanese popcorn chicken\n- [zhu xie gao \u8c6c\u8840\u7cd5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjN7hYi6xKA&pp=ygUVcGlnIGJsb29kIGNha2UgcmVjaXBl0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv): pig blood cake\n- [tie dan \u9435\u86cb](https://www.thehongkongcookery.com/2022/01/chinese-iron-eggs.html): iron eggs\n- [Haishan sauce \u6d77\u5c71\u91ac](https://yunhai.shop/blogs/recipes/oyster-omelets-%E8%9A%B5%E4%BB%94%E7%85%8E?srsltid=AfmBOopcGqSNsyyzIADv_rFtyyr8GFFLzu5USTNfxn0nqHKW4EbgtQQe)\n- [garlic thick soy sauce \u849c\u84c9\u91ac\u6cb9\u818f](https://cookinginchinglish.com/taiwanese-thick-soy-sauce/)\n\nThe ba wan were the most complicated as they involved making a dough out rice flour, sweet potato starch, tapioca starch and water as well as a pork filling. The dough is really sticky so the recipe recommends using small bowls to first spread a thin layer of dough into, then scoop a ball of filling, then seal with more dough. This did work well but I didn't quite grease the bowls properly so not all of my dumplings came out well. These are often served with coriander and the Haishan and garlic thick soy sauce. These were absolutely delicious and even the ones that didn't look so pretty still tasted great. \n\nI chose the pig blood cake because that was pretty far out of my comfort zone and I do really love black pudding. It's only made with pig blood, glutinous rice and salt, which is then steamed. I really doubted it would work out but it set up perfectly! Traditionally these are dipped into peanut powder and coriander. I really enjoyed these, reminiscent of black pudding but with a much bouncier texture.\n\nThe popcorn chicken were very much in my comfort zone, and I particularly liked this recipe. The marinade gave the chicken so much flavour, and the sweet potato starch gave a really crunchy coating. This has deep fried basil leaves which went unexpectedly really well with the chicken, although I definitely added way too many into my deep frying oil at once, it nearly bubbled over and terrified myself! \n\nThe iron eggs are similar to other soy-marinated eggs, except you simmer and cool the eggs multiple times which makes the eggs shrink and changes the texture. Supposedly this dish was invented when a vendor hadn't sold the eggs from the previous day, so she had to continually reheat them. These were the only miss of this meal, they were too salty for me and I much prefer a softer yolk.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/c0u8kxbgd0ye1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1746034650.0, "score": 75, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1kbmfvw/week_18_taiwanese_night_market_ba_wan_\u8089\u5713_yan_su/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Week 17: On Sale - Parmesan Crusted Turkey Breast and Creamy Vodka Pasta (Meta: From My Garden)", "selftext": "Any resemblance to last week's post is purely coincidental. Ahem.\n\nEvery November for Thanksgiving my favorite grocery store (HEB) has a sale where if you buy a ham, you get an 11 pound turkey for free. Anything above 11 you pay like $1.20 a pound for. I buy an insane amount of ham for my breakfast kolaches, so I ended up with a lot of turkeys last fall! I thawed them and broke them down and refroze the pieces. This was the last of the breast meat. I treated it exactly like I would for chicken parmesan - butterflied, salted, then a coating of flour and garlic powder, then eggs, then a coating of panko, parmesan, garlic powder and parsley flakes.\n\nThe vodka pasta was new to me and is something I've wanted to try for a long time. I don't drink but I will cook with alcohol, and I had to make a stop at a liquor store to buy a small bottle of vodka. That was an amusing interaction. The reason I decided on this recipe for this week's theme (and there were so many options because I buy a lot of meat on sale) was that Brian Lagerstrom just posted a video for this sauce that uses Calabrian chilis. I bought those for a theme last year and haven't touched them since, so it was great to get some more use out of them! The pasta was awesome, if spicy (#SpiceWimp) and I will absolutely make it again!\n\nFor my meta, I harvested fresh parsley from my garden. It's starting to bolt and I won't have it for much longer, but I had enough for a decent topping!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k6ez9i", "created_utc": 1745454670.0, "score": 19, "author": "ObsessiveAboutCats", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k6ez9i/week_17_on_sale_parmesan_crusted_turkey_breast/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Week 17: On Sale - Duck \u00e0 l'Orange", "selftext": "My local supermarket had baskets full of flowers on sale the week after Mother\u2019s Day, with loads of daffodils. I picked up three bunches, which were reduced from over \u00a312 in total to about \u00a32.50. The theme had just been announced so I hoped I could use the daffodils in some way in my dish. Unfortunately, when I came to researching it turns out that daffodils contain lycorine so are highly toxic and are absolutely not safe for consumption. After a couple of days my daffodils had all opened and looked beautiful, but I was about to go on holiday so thought about using them in a decorative way for my dish for this theme, to give them one last hurrah before they had to be binned.\n\nI found a whole duck on offer and so instantly thought of Duck \u00e0 l'Orange because I had quite a few spare oranges leftover from my citrus cake. I almost made [this Jacques P\u00e9pin recipe](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/duck-lorange) for week 1 this year, but chose something else as I couldn\u2019t find duck very cheaply, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try this recipe out. The duck is roasted and then the recipe calls for making a duck gravy from the neck and gizzards along with some vegetables, aromatics, stock and wine. This is then added to an orange syrup with vinegar, redcurrant jelly and butter, which makes for a really shiny, deeply flavoured sauce. I decided that only using pantry ingredients (except for the duck) felt in the spirit of this theme, so I used only the vegetables I had on hand (so missed the celery and leek) as well as omitting the Grand Marnier, and served with roast potatoes and broccoli.\n\nI made a kind of floral wreath to decorate my duck and sauce, taking care not to let the daffodils touch any of the food. I really liked this dish, the sauce is sweet and savoury and pairs so well with the duck. Duck is probably my favourite meat so I\u2019m delighted to find another way to make it! \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/f1dxqwu2rkwe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745409700.0, "score": 158, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k5xdo9/week_17_on_sale_duck_\u00e0_lorange/", "html_title": ""}

This helps to add extra veggies and fiber to your diet and kind of gets it out of the way so you can focus on enjoying your actual lunch or dinner or whatever. She generally starts these videos by saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re watching this, it\u2019s dinosaur time.\u201d She often includes on-screen text with dinosaur facts to read while she eats. Toward the end of her videos, she shares what her actual meal will be, while reminding us that \u201cdinosaur time is not a meal replacement.\u201d Her content is wholesome, it\u2019s creative, it\u2019s healthy. Obviously, it was perfect for this week\u2019s challenge.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn\u2019t think I could justify this week\u2019s challenge with just a handful of plain greens \ud83d\ude02 So, I looked to one of her non-dinosaur time videos where she made Agua de Pepino (kind of like a cucumber slushie with lemon juice and sugar). I also made a quasi-banh mi with tofu based on one of her post-dinosaur time meals (hers had pork belly).

The challenging part for this dish was using a mortar and pestle to mash garlic, salt, pork rinds, and the fried plantains by hand. I don't have a masher so it took a bit of timer using this technique. My first serving came out a bit salty with the salted pork rinds. I pulled back a bit on the salt on the second serving but went too heavy on the garlic. \n\nOriginally, I was going to serve my mofongo with a chicken broth. However, the wife also wanted Jamaican jerk chicken this week for meal prep. The chicken was ready to go when I had completed the Puerto Rican dish so we had them together. Excellent combination! Overall, I enjoyed mofongo, it was incredibly easy to make! It left me curious - should I fry a mofongo patty next time? Or maybe substitute the pork rinds with bacon...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4g0ko", "created_utc": 1745248487.0, "score": 18, "author": "japanesebeats", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k4g0ko/week_15_puerto_rican_mofongo_with_jamaican_jerk/", "html_title": ""}

It\u2019s also the most time intensive with a couple of nested recipes for carrot syrup and raspberry jam, although they were both fairly simple to make. The frosting was mousse like\u2014 a freshly whipped cream folded into a classic cream cheese frosting. \n\nSecond place was a tie between Claire Saffitz and Nancy Silverton. Both had a nutty rich brown butter cream cheese frosting. Claire\u2019s had pecans and no dried fruit and was more a classic cake and Nancy\u2019s had roasted carrots and walnuts (it was also a more time intensive cake) and was a spicier richer cake. \n\nThe Zoe Bakes cake had coconut. I love coconut cake but did not care for it personally in carrot cake the texture was chewy and dry, it was unanimously our least favorite. The orange zest in like was lovely though. The frosting was flavored with lemon extract and lemon juice.\n\nThe lobster was flavored simply by its tomalley and a pinch of curry powder and lemon zest.  \n\nThe bunuelo was a mixture of feta cheese, sugar, salt, baking powder, wheat flour and corn flour, then deep fried.

{"title": "Week 16: Battered - Citrus Birthday Cake", "selftext": "This is my birthday cake for this year, I\u2019ll start by saying that I feel like this is a bit of a cop out by me because I was always going to bake myself a cake, but the theme was announced just before I decided on what I was going to bake...and I definitely did make a cake batter...\nand I have done an awful lot of deep frying lately... Usually I get inspiration from the theme but this time the theme has taken inspiration from the day of my birth!\n\nBecause my birthday is right at the beginning of Spring, I am always drawn to flavours and decoration that represent the change of season. I have always loved citrus in desserts, and it felt right for the warmer weather. I thought it would be fun to celebrate all kinds of citrus all in one cake and took ideas from [this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/6-inch-citrus-cake/) which uses mixed zest and juice into the batter, I doubled the cake recipe and baked it in two 9-inch tins. I managed to find lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit and blood oranges at the supermarket, and I thought it would be fun to make each one into a different curd. [This](https://buttermilkbysam.com/the-best-lemon-curd/) is my favourite lemon curd recipe because it has a lot of lemon juice and zest so it\u2019s extra tangy, and also uses whole eggs so there is no faff with separating yolks, you just sieve any bits out at the end to give a silky texture. I made a small batch of this recipe 5 times, just changing the citrus each time to get 5 different curds. I realised my lemon, lime and orange curd all looked pretty much identical so I added a few drops of food colouring so I could identify each curd more easily.

The smell of charred chiles and cooking tortillas and the sound of a wooden pestle pounding against a kruk would escort you on your evening walks home.

It's marinaded overnight with a mixture of blended garlic, fresh oregano, salt, pepper and adobo seasoning, and then it cooks slowly at about 140\u00b0C for 5 hours before turning up high to make the cuerito - the crispy skin. I used [this recipe](https://youtu.be/1V6HIGf64bA?feature=shared) and followed a tip in the comments to wrap in parchment paper before wrapping in foil so that the foil wouldn't stick to the skin but would trap all the moisture inside during the slow cooking portion of the cooking time. \n\nTo accompany the pernil I made [arroz con gandules](https://www.delishdlites.com/occasion/holiday-recipes/arroz-con-gandules-puerto-rican-rice-with-pigeon-peas-recipe/) (rice with pigeon peas), [tostones](https://salimaskitchen.com/tostones/) (twice fried plantain) and avocado. \n\nThe meat was easily the star of the show, meltingly tender with excellent crunchy crackling. The arroz con gandules was delicious as well, packed full of flavour and texture. The pigeon peas were hard to find but I did manage to source a tin of cooked ones, they were good but I don't think I would've noticed a huge deal if I had substituted them for lentils. I really liked the dish as a whole but I did find it a bit rich. When I had leftovers I made a salad with a tangy citrus dressing which went really nicely. I'm definitely making the pork again soon.

{"title": "Week 11:  Nostalgic - Strawberry Proats and Aojiru  (Meta: Resourceful)", "selftext": "I had a hard time figuring out what to do for this week. The thing that came to mind is something my mom used to make, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it without going out of my way to get a bunch of ingredients and substituting a lot, which would defeat the purpose/goal of my meta. So I kept thinking, and thought back to when I first moved back to FL from Japan and established an extremely set routine as I struggled to adjust. One aspect of that routine was making and having a big bowl of oatmeal and a green smoothie every day. Nowadays, I also tend to eat things on a loop for a very long time, so here we have meal-prepped oats filled out with soy protein and strawberries, chilled and reheated to increase the resistant starch. And then, rather than a smoothie, some aojiru (Japanese green juice) made with green tea, kale and barley sprouts. As I\u2019m in a really transitional phase of life right now, I find myself thinking back to that point more and more often lately, so it was the perfect meal for reminiscing.\n\nAbout my meta: Basically, this year I want to try to use things I already have on hand and minimize buying new things just for challenges as much as possible. I have so many ingredients and miscellaneous foodstuff that I think it\u2019ll be a great way to get creative and make sure things don\u2019t go to waste.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/pecfkv794ste1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744191309.0, "score": 8, "author": "inkay", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1jv1pxv/week_11_nostalgic_strawberry_proats_and_aojiru/", "html_title": ""}

There was advice to not add the ginger until the cream/milk was up to 170\u00b0 F and it definitely didn\u2019t curdle which was great. \n\nSwipe to see how we actually ate the ice cream versus the somewhat plated/nicer looking version.

The ugali itself has a mild corn flavor since that's what its primarily made of. \n\nI really hope you'll consider trying the dish out! It was much easier to make than I expected, and the only ingredient you \\*might\\* have to search a little extra for would be the corn flour, but even that can be sourced easily online. \n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/wff2g6nvoqte1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744174700.0, "score": 11, "author": "Stand_Up_Eight", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1juxwo4/week_12_tanzanian_ugali_na_maharage_ya_nazi_meta/", "html_title": ""}
