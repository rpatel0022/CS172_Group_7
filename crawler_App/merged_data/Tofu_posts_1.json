(also, if i do go longer than the 30 min, do i need to refrigerate while pressing?)\n\nAny responses and/ or other tips are greatly appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/123nlgb/tofu_by_some_basic_tofu_questions/", "created_utc": 1679925289.0, "score": 187, "author": "Ghotiwon", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/123nlgb/tofu_by_some_basic_tofu_questions/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I have recently been wondering if heating the milk with the okara in it will extract more proteins from the pulp?

Cause you want a clean milk to get a soft and smooth tofu.\n\n2 - it doesnt really matter wich temperature you cook it on, but be sure to stir it constantly so that it doesnt burn at the bottom. What you want is to reach boiling point and turn the fire off ass soon as the milk starts to rise to the top. And at that point add the coagulant    slowly and stiring until you get to see some clearer, less milky water.  Then it is ready to take the chunks out onto the press. \n\n3 - Pressing it overnight might be overkill and it would need refrigeration. You can press the tofu for 15 min if you press it with enough weight. I press it for around an hour with the amount of weight I press it with. I was mostly seeking a very firm tofu. Wich was what people wanted to buy.\n\nIf you wanna use the okara in some way I recommend making \"Unohana\" wich is a japanese dish you can search its recipe for.\nOr you can do what I did and make \"Tempeh\" with your okara, as it was the original ingredient to make tempeh.", "1. Not really! All the best producers strain after cooking as there's higher yield and more flavor. I agree that convenience is the main thing.\n2. For unpressed silken tofu or soymik, I'd recommend cooking the soymilk at 100C for 14 minutes. That inactivates the majority of the trypsin inhibitors (TI), an antidigestive nutrient. For tofu that will be pressed, 100C for 7-10 minutes is fine. Pressing removes some of the whey, which is where the TI hang out. Coagulants all have different target temps: GDL 90C for 30-60min; gypsum 70-75C for 30 min; nigari 70-85C added in three batches over 30 min; acid (pickled vegetable juice, lemon juice, etc.) 90C added in three batches over 30 min. As they're added slowly, its important to maintain nigari and acid batches at a warm temperature throughout the coagulation process. An easy way is to coagulate in a rice cooker set to warm. Within those ranges, lower temperatures tend to lead to longer and more tender coagulation, whereas higher is faster and rougher.\n3. In China, some very dry pressed tofus are pressed for a long time. Normally they're left outside, maybe not the best for food safety, but definitely tasty. I have a hunch that pressing tofu when it's fresh and warm helps the curds set more delicately than pressing when cold, though I haven't tested it.\n\n(Most of these tips come from personal experience working in a Chinese tofu factory or William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi's book Tofu & Soymilk Production.)\n\nHope this helps!", "Do you separate the soy beans?

Begin by preparing the tofu. Wrap the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and set a heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes to expel excess moisture. After pressing, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.\n2. Cook the jasmine rice as per the package instructions until each grain is separate and tender. Fluff with a fork once done and cover to retain warmth.\n3. In a non-stick skillet, warm the sesame oil over medium flame. Once hot, add the tofu cubes. Saut\u00e9, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden and crispy, approximately 8-10 minutes.\n4. As the tofu cooks, prepare the sticky sauce. In a small mixing bowl, combine the minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, gochujang, and rice vinegar. Stir until well mixed.\n5. Once the tofu is cooked, reduce the skillet's heat to low. Carefully pour the sauce mixture over the crispy tofu. Let it simmer gently, frequently stirring, until the sauce thickens and adheres to the tofu, creating a glossy coating (about 5 minutes).\n6. To serve, spoon the fluffy jasmine rice into bowls.

Allow the sauce to reduce by about 25%, making sure to stir constantly, about 2 \u2013 3 minutes.\n9.\tAdd in your pork and cook it until it has completely cooked through, about 3 \u2013 4 minutes. Add in the sugar and the ground, toasted Szechuan peppercorn powder. Mix thoroughly to combine.\n10.\tPour out any excess moisture that has leached from the tofu cubes, then add them carefully into your pan. Working very gently, combine the tofu and the meat together, making sure not to mash up the tofu in the process. As the tofu cooks, it will leach moisture into the meat mixture, creating a sauce. Allow the mixture to come to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring everything together slowly and carefully, about 5 minutes, or until the tofu is heated all the way through. Taste the mapo tofu and adjust the seasoning to taste.\n11.\tCarefully spoon your mapo tofu to a serving dish, then garnish with sliced green onions and serve.\n\n##NOTES:\n- Items denoted with an * can be omitted if you would like to make a non-spicy version of this dish.\n- From step 9, if you taste the sauce mixture, you may feel that it is too salty. This is on purpose and when you add in the tofu from step 10, the moisture that leaches from the tofu will balance out the saltiness.", "What is DaoJan?\n"]}

{"title": "Non-vegetarian tofu lover here (yes, we exist!) Looking for interesting recipes to try!", "selftext": "A little backstory: I was vegetarian for a couple of years when I was in high school. But I was doing it for the wrong reasons: to be cool. It's actually a little more complicated than that, but that's the basics. Even though I currently eat meat, I cultivated a lasting love of vegan/vegetarian food. Anytime we go to a restaurant that has an interesting sounding vegetarian dish, I will usually opt for that over meat. And 90% of the time I eat meat sparingly anyway because of a medical condition.\n\nSo. In the last few years I've learned to make good crispy tofu. I marinate it in Asian flavors and fry it with a light dusting of corn starch, and it turns out pretty darn good. I've made it into bahn mi with homemade pickles, and I freaking love it. I've used it on rice bowls. I've tossed it in stir-fry. Crispy tofu is great.\n\nI know I can use tofu in soup as well, but I'm wondering what else I can do with it? When I was a teenager I pretty much just made it into \"scrambled eggs\" because I wasn't very good at cooking. But basically, what I've listed above is pretty much all I know how to do.\n\nI'm not really interested in making my own meat alternatives, so tofurkey and things like that aren't that interesting to me. But surely that's not all there is to tofu, right? Crispy fried, miso soup, and fake meat?

I still put the coagulant, but coagulated in tiny bits instead of the big chunks it usually does. The tofu came out too soft and crumbly.

Maybe that helps.\n\n  \nTofu is made by causing proteins to bind to each other. Maybe increasing this binding, as opposed to removing more water, will create firmer tofu for you. \n\nThis can be done by either increasing the nigari (a magnesium salt, MgCl2) or maybe reducing pH using e.g. lemon juice. Reducing pH causes the proteins to turn inside out and cling to each other whereas magnesium and calcium salts reduce the repelling forces proteins feel toward each other, causing them to collide more easily and bind to each other that way. Two different mechanisms but a similar end result. \n\n(It is not this black and white, in reality changing the charge by introducing salts will also mess with the protein structure,  but that's the gist of it.)\n\nYou can also try increasing the length of the heating step, as heating destabilizes the proteins and cause them to flip, even in the abscence of acids."]}

Some of them are better suited for different dishes, while some of it comes down to taste.\n\nThe most important thing to be aware of when dealing with tofu is that it has a very mild if non-existent flavor.  BUT, if you press the liquid out of it, freeze it, or, according to that article, quickly brine it, you can impart it with whatever flavor you want.\n\nThat's why it's great in Asian food.  A lot of it is based around really tasty, well-balanced sauces.\n\nOther than that, t's extremely versatile. Think of Bubba from Forrest Gump listing all of the shrimp dishes.  That's tofu.

That sounds like when I used adulterated / watered down soy milk to make tofu hua (soft tofu desert) and it failed to coagulate fully.", "One possibility is the stirring method. Stirring too little can leave pockets of unseparated soy milk, but stirring too much can break up the curds. The recipe I use has super specific stirring instructions for when you add in the nigari. It also recommends bringing the soy milk to a boil and then taking it off the heat and letting it sit for a few minutes before adding coagulant.  [Here\u2019s](https://www.kqed.org/bayareabites/117887/diy-tofu-making-homemade-tofu-is-easier-than-you-think) a link, but I\u2019ll put in the stirring instructions here:    \n    \n> - While stirring with a wooden spoon, pour about one third of the nigari-water mixture into the soy milk. Continue to stir in a z-shaped pattern six to eight more times. Stop the spoon in the center of the pot and hold it there until the milk stops moving. Remove the spoon.\nSprinkle another third of the nigari-water mixture over the soy milk. Cover the pot and let the mixture rest for 3 minutes.    \n> - Uncover the pot. The soy milk mixture should be curdling at this point. Sprinkle the remaining nigari-water mixture over the top and use the wooden spoon to gently stir it into the milk. Try to get it into any spots of the milk that don\u2019t look curdled, but try not to disturb the curds too much with your stirring. Cover the pot and let the mixture rest for another 3 minutes.    \n> - Uncover the pot and take a look. If you see curds fully separated from clear yellow whey, you\u2019re ready to move on. If you see still see milky areas in the pot, gently give those areas a stir, cover the pot and let it sit for another 3 minutes. At this point, the soy milk should be fully curdled; if not, you will likely need to add more nigari.   \n    \nSo, ideally, you really only stir it once, just after you add in the first bit of nigari. After that you just kind of let it do it\u2019s thing unless you see little pockets of milk, but even then, if you\u2019re still adding in nigari, you can just pour the nigari exactly where it appears not to have separated as a little stir-free spot correction. You just really want to limit the stirring once the separation has started if you want larger curds.\n    \nAlso, I don\u2019t know for sure if this would affect curd size, but I know using soft water versus hard water can affect your final product, with soft water being preferable. I usually use either distilled water or filtered water for the soaking/soy milk."]}

Tofu was thought to be invented as a poor man\u2019s cheese since soybeans are much more affordable than caring for animals. \n\nThere are so many ways you can make tofu. There\u2019s special chemicals like calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, or niargi to raise the ph that makes the milk curdle. However, you can raise the ph by using vinegar, lemon juice, or anything acidic. \nI regularly make labneh from soy milk where I ferment the milk with water kefir. The kefir raises the ph and makes the milk curdle. I strain it and am left with a creamy tangy cheese. \nYou can do this with rejuvelac, sauerkraut juice, or any fermented brine too.\n\nAnd then you can get into playing with different plant milk mixtures with these techniques\u2026.\nOh the boundaries of tofu and cheese", "Tofu is actually sloth milk, so its a cheese but not vegan. it's a secret vegans don't want getting out cause it harms their \"no animal based products\" line, but as sloths move slow and are most times covered I'm mould it kinda is a plant based product so kinda is vegan cheese and vegan meat\ud83d\ude0b.", " General overview, making \u8c46\u8150 (tofu) or  \u092a\u0928\u0940\u0930 (Indian cheese)    \n1) Heat the milk.   \n2) Add Lemon Juice.   \n3) strain the curds.   \n4) Squease the curds.   \n\nIf you started with soy milk, you have tofu\nIf you started with cow/buffalo milk, you have dairy cheese (specifically paneer)\n(you'll want to salt the curds but it isn't technically required)\n\nSimilar for ricotta, or any acid set dairy cheese.
