I appreciate the enthusiasm for them all.  But, compared to the channels I've seen, I think this guy trumps them for commitment.\n\nIt's recipes for UK Chinese takeaway meals.

He looks to be in his 50s or 60s and *he's a takeaway delivery driver from Scotland who learned to cook by watching chefs cooking the food he was delivering.*\n\nThat's a classic movie trope; the student learning by watching the master.  Not being taught what to do, but *absorbing* the skill.\n\nHe had a friend make him a full-on wok burner with propane tank that he uses outside.  In his clips he seems to be wearing dark glasses, an overcoat and polished brown shoes.\n\nAll this is enough to like the channel, but the thing that sealed it is he has videos of *other people cooking.*  No commentary, just filming people cooking.  That shows a deep respect and interest, I think.\n\nI remember being shown the kitchen of a Chinese restauraunt here in London when was I was a kid.  We'd been going for years and I felt really *special* to be allowed to watch them.  It's stuck with me decades later.  I suspect he was struck by seeing the chefs in the same way I was, but he did something about it.\n\nHe even has a video of his local supermarket.   Not a tour, not an ingredient comparison video, just the shelves.  I think he just wants to show people something he cares about.\n\nThis guy really, really loves Chinese food.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ukchinesetakeawayrecipesbyalex](https://www.youtube.com/@ukchinesetakeawayrecipesbyalex)\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1941c6y/i_found_a_youtube_channel_of_a_guy_who_loves/", "created_utc": 1704978574.0, "score": 248, "author": "GentlemanJoe", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1941c6y/i_found_a_youtube_channel_of_a_guy_who_loves/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I recently bought 3 lbs of pork shoulder and made Char Siu for the first time. It turned out fantastic!", "selftext": "I\u2019ve always been a big fan of Char Siu and many Asian dishes in general, and with the holidays coming I decided to make it for the first time as my grocery store had pork shoulder on sale. I got 3lbs for $6 and then had to find a recipe that I trusted. I settled on two different recipes, from YouTubers whose other recipes I\u2019ve tried in the past and they\u2019ve been fantastic, Cooking With Lau and Souped Up Recipes, and since I couldn\u2019t decide which to make, I ended up making both, each with 1 \u00bdlbs of the pork shoulder. \n\nOne note, Souped Up Recipes recently updated her recipe as her initial recipe was one of her first videos and she recently changed it. I was also curious as the two recipes were really different and I wanted to know going forward which one gave me the results I was desiring. \n\nBoth were pretty easy to make, but just required wait time between the initial preparation and the cooking process. Cooking With Lau\u2019s was the easier of the two as the prep was basically mixing a marinade in a bowl, then pouring it into a ziploc bag and adding the meat, whereas Souped Up Recipes required mixing the marinade in a sauce pan and cooking it down before adding it to a ziploc bag with the meat. After that, the recipes were similar so I made them both at the same time. \n\nThe only noticeable difference for me from their recipes was that mine needed about 10-15 more minutes in the oven to reach my internal temperature goal of 170\u00b0F. Yes, pork is technically done before that temperature, but after doing some reading online, I desired that temperature so that the fat could render a bit more. \n\nEnd result was fantastic! Both were great, which made me happily frustrated as I was hoping one would be a clear cut winner, but it left me with 3lbs of pure Char Siu deliciousness for a fraction of the price that my local Chinese Food restaurants charge. \n\nIn the photos, Cooking With Lau on the left, Souped Up Recipes on the right\n\nRecipes:\nCooking With Lau:\nhttps://youtu.be/zkCoAKTbHpQ?si=etAvg5YGpzEYne7J\nSouped Up Recipes:\nhttps://youtu.be/umFzNSE194c?si=zvPc1yZk_felsa4K", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmrn6n", "created_utc": 1735229854.0, "score": 186, "author": "Drawing_The_Line", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1hmrn6n/i_recently_bought_3_lbs_of_pork_shoulder_and_made/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Is Chinese Brown Sauce a 'thing' in China too? (the difficulty in translating sauces, plus two recipes)", "selftext": "[This post also exists in video form, if that\u2019s more your speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9dP-MmC25I).\n\nWithin the American Chinese takeout universe, there seems to be this thing called\u2026 \u201cbrown sauce\u201d. \n\nFor the unfamiliar, a quick google should fill you in. It\u2019s \u2013 apparently \u2013 that stuff that\u2019s smothered over your Egg Foo Young, the sauce that\u2019s fried in with your beef and broccoli. There\u2019s an absolute smorgasbord of English language recipes online for it, tons of blogs touting it as a \u2018universal stir fry sauce\u2019, the predictable cacophony of Redditors arguing over the most authentic preparations. The renowned Martin Yan refers to it as \u201cthe Chinese mother sauce\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s if you poke around in English, that is. \n\nThe same search in Chinese? This so-called \u201cbrown sauce\u201d is\u2026 nowhere to be found. No matter what permutation you try (\u68d5/\u8910 for brown, \u9171/\u6c41 for sauce, etc), pretty much the thing you\u2019ll be able to find will be centered around either British HP sauce or French Espagnole sauce. Digging through all our various Cantonese cookbooks \u2013 new ones, old ones, whatever \u2013 also yields a similar about of \u2018nada\u2019. \n\nFor something that\u2019s supposedly *so* universal, that\u2019s pretty weird, right? \n\nIn the past, my base assumption was that Brown Sauce was a sort of collective misnomer: white America goes to a Chinese restaurant, sees some brown saucy stuff in their stir fry, slapdashedly refers to it as \u2018brown sauce\u2019. A Chinese diner might not refer to things in the same way\u2026 but that\u2019s ok, right? Different cooking systems, different cultural touchstones.\n\nBut we can\u2019t so easily write off Brown Sauce off as this sort of collective hallucination of white America \u2013 it\u2019s not just newspapers and redditors that talk about the stuff, but American cooks and chefs as well. From [Martin Yan\u2019s Brown Sauce](https://www.food.com/recipe/all-purpose-stir-fry-sauce-brown-garlic-sauce-87748), to [The Art of Cooking\u2019s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsHAix_kBrg), to [Bill from the renowned Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-chicken-broccoli-brown-sauce/) \u2013 I mean, these are some absolutely first rate Chinese American sources. If they *all* seem to agree on the \u2018thing-ness\u2019 of this universal brown sauce, they\u2019re not wrong.\n\nAnd I mean, a lot of that classic takeout fare *does* tend to revolve around a certain set of Cantonese flavors. And if you took a peek back into one of those kitchens, at times you can see the chef reaching for something pre-made and\u2026 brown. It\u2019s a thing.\n\nSo then, the questions naturally follow: what is this brown sauce? How is it made? Does it exist in China too?\n\nTo answer these and find the in-China equivalent, we\u2019ll need to drill down and really think about what we mean when we\u2019re talking about \u2018sauce\u2019. And to do *that*, it\u2019s probably a little easier to start with what the internet seems to refer to as \u201cChinese white sauce\u201d \u2013 an easier translation puzzle.\n\n## The Conundrum of Translating \u201cSauce\u201d \n\nBelow is a picture of a Moo Goo Gai Pan, a dish that\u2019s famously supposed to contain a \u201cChinese white sauce\u201d.\nhttps://imagedelivery.net/9lr8zq_Jvl7h6OFWqEi9IA/df31121f-8717-4eb8-7e8f-688aea386800/public\n\nYou see chicken. You see mushrooms. You also see that everything\u2019s good and coated and saucy. And that sauce is kind of\u2026 white. So, \u201cwhite sauce\u201d, right? \n\n*Maybe* you could translate it that way, maybe not. \n\nForgive an ever so brief language lesson. At the risk of drastically simplifying things, in Chinese, you\u2019ve got:\n\n1.\t*Jiang* (\u9171). English, \u201csauce\u201d. Generally speaking, jiangs tend to be components, intermediate products. Ground bean sauce? Ground bean *jiang*. Ketchup? Tomato *jiang*.\n2.\t*Zhi* (\u6c41). English, \u201csauce\u201d. A similarly incredibly broad word, but the physical thing that\u2019s on your plate after stir frying would be called a zhi. For example, sweet and sour sauce is called tangcu*zhi*. If you take that aforementioned ketchup and fry it up with a bunch of other ingredients, it becomes qie*zhi*, and you can smother it over a pork chop at Chachaanteng.\n\nSo in a western context, most sauces are usually translated as \u2018zhi\u2019. \n\n*Bechemel: Baizhi\u767d\u6c41, \u2018White sauce\u2019. \n* Hollandaise: Helanzhi \u8377\u5170\u6c41, \u2018Holland sauce\u2019. \n* Gravy: Rouzhi \u8089\u6c41, \u2018Meat sauce\u2019\n\nThe trouble with our Moo Goo Gai Pan is that while that saucy white stuff is a zhi, that zhi doesn\u2019t *really* have a name. In an American context, it might be a little like talking about what goes in on the topping of a casserole \u2013 you can of course refer to the stuff as a \u201ctopping\u201d, but there\u2019s no one single casserole-topping recipe, and no American Escoffier has come about to create a structured system of casserole-toppings. It\u2019s just\u2026 a topping. More of a concept, more of a **technique** than a singular \u2018thing\u2019.\n\nLuckily however, the question of \u201cwhat goes in the white sauce in my Moo Goo Gai Pan\u201d *does* have a clear, relatively structured answer, and that\u2019s\u2026\n\n## The Qian Technique\n\nLast Chinese terminology I\u2019ll introduce, I swear \u2013 and I promise it\u2019s pretty straightforward. \n\n*Qian* (\u82a1) refers to a technique to thicken a liquid with a slurry \u2013 verb form, *gouqian* (\u52fe\u82a1). It\u2019s just as uncomplicated and straightforward as it sounds, pretty much exactly the same as what you\u2019d see, like, a western pan sauce. You make a stir fry with a bit of liquid inside, drizzle in your starch/water mixture, and stir til thick. Fin.\n\nFor our Moo Goo Gai Pan, there\u2019s a specific type of *qian* that it employs called a \u201cCrystal Qian\u201d (\u7409\u7483\u82a1). All *that* means is that the liquid that you thickened was a seasoned stock and\u2026 not too much else. Here\u2019s what that looks like in practice, via the excellent *Art of Cooking*:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6vCZSGtuCYM?si=JdgEJNCbaTCe7GUN&t=380\n\nSo \u201cChinese White Sauce\u201d could perhaps be thought of as a \u201cCrystal Qian\u201d\u2026 but it\u2019s important to note that unlike the word \u2018sauce\u2019, this is a **technique**. No diners in China are going around being like \u201cmmm I can\u2019t get me enough of this Crystal Qian\u201d \u2013 if anything, they might say \u201cthe chef is able to control the qian very well\u201d or more likely\u2026 not even really think about it much at all.\n\n## How to Make a \u201cWhite Sauce\u201d (i.e. employ a crystal qian)\n\nSo we\u2019ll cover how to make this \u2018white sauce\u2019, but definitely note that for the most part it exists **inseparable from the stir fry itself** (though sometimes it can coat steamed dishes). It\u2019s not something you can buy, it\u2019s not something that a restaurant would batch prep or store.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll start things off with a \u2018seasoned stock\u2019, but in practice things can sometimes get a little more\u2026 seasoning than stock: chicken bouillon powder and MSG do a good bit of the heavy lifting. So if you felt like getting super fancy, a [Cantonese superior stock](https://youtu.be/Y248pBTcflw?si=HumlDLuDHtMXyeLT&t=101) could obviously work, but that\u2019s far far from mandatory. You could use a simple whatever Chinese pork stock, some western-style chicken stock so long as it\u2019s unroasted and not too heavily seasoned with herbs and such (some stock bought stocks in the west can get really\u2026 thyme-y), or even just use water. \n\nSecond, for the starch most of you will likely be carrying cornstarch in your cupboard. If at all possible, swap that for either potato or tapioca starch \u2013 these starches thicken better, are quicker to act, and hold longer after cooking. Cornstarch can work in a pinch, but is generally thought of as the least-good option for this sort of thing (great for deep frying coatings however).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. *Seasoned stock: pork -or- chicken stock, \u00bd cup; water, \u00bd cup; chicken bouillon powder (\u9e21\u7c89), 1 tsp; sugar, \u00bd tsp; salt, \u00bc tsp; MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), \u00bc tsp.* Or, again, use all stock or all water.\n2. *Oil, lard preferably, 2 tbsp.*\n2. *Aromatics: ~1 large clove garlic, minced; ~1cm ginger, minced.*\n3. *Liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), 1 tbsp.*\n4. *Slurry: starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 1 tbsp; mixed with 2 tbsp water*\n\nMix all the ingredients for the \u2018seasoned stock\u2019 in a bowl. \n\nTo a wok, first longyau \u2013 get it piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil \u2013 and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Flame still off, add in the minced aromatics and tip the flame to medium-low. Fry until fragrant, ~30 seconds.\n\nUp the flame to high. Swirl in the wine and give everything a quick mix. Add in the seasoned stock. Bring it up to a rapid boil, then down to a simmer. In a thin stream, drizzle the slurry in while stirring constantly. You should be looking for something slightly before spoon-coating-consistency.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019d could add whatever pre-cooked ingredients you\u2019d be making for your specific stir fry. There\u2019s also flexibility \u2013 you can also swap up the order of operations a bit (more on that in the notes at the end of the post).\n\nSo to bring that all together, let\u2019s take a gander at one of my all time favorite Cantonese Banquet dishes, Broccoli and Shrimp.\n\n## Broccoli and Shrimp\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1.\t*Shrimp, shell-on, 800g*\n2.\t*Sodium Carbonate (\u78b1\u9762) -or- Kansui Lye Water (\u67a7\u6c34), \u00bd tsp*.\n3.\t*Marinade for the shrimp: salt, \u00bc tsp; white pepper powder, \u00bc tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), \u00bc tsp; starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 1 tsp*\n4.\t*Broccoli, 400g.*\n5.\t*For garnish (optional): red mild chili, 1 -or- red bell pepper, \u00bd; carrot, ~1 inch.*   \n6.\t*Aromatics: garlic, 1 large clove, minced; ginger, ~1cm, minced*\n7.\t*Liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing Wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), 1 tbsp*\n8.\t*Seasoned stock: pork -or- chicken stock, \u00bd cup; water, \u00bd cup; chicken bouillon powder (\u9e21\u7c89), 1 tsp; sugar, \u00bd tsp; salt, \u00bc tsp; MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), \u00bc tsp*. As discussed above.\n9.\t*Slurry: starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 2.5 tsp; mixed with 2.5 tbsp water*\n10.\t*Toasted sesame oil (\u9ebb\u6cb9), 1 tsp.*\n\n**Process:**\n\nCut the broccoli into florets, and the florets in half. Mince the garlic and the ginger. Slice the (optional) mild chili/bell pepper into roughly 1 inch diamonds, and the (optional) carrot into ~3mm sheets. \n\nTo prepare the shrimp, the general approach here was ala our [Shrimp: the Maximally Delicious Way](https://youtu.be/uq6ghFESDjA?si=rj5Dv1mME1Yy-JtT) video, if you\u2019d like a visual on that.\n\nRemove the shell and heads from the shrimp. Place in a bowl and mix in the \u00bd tsp sodium carbonate (or kan sui). Fill up with water right above the shrimp, let sit for 3-5 minutes. Then place the bowl in a sink under a thin stream of running water, and let it all rinse for 3-10 minutes. This process is to remove the slime of the shrimp and help it retain its pop when cooking.\n\nAfter that time, transfer the shrimp to a kitchen towel and thoroughly pat dry. Then, butterfly the shrimp by slicing in from the back and opening the shrimp like a book \u2013 I personally like to remove the vein once the shrimp are butterflied. Give the shrimp a quick pat dry again with a paper towel, then transfer to a bowl. Add the \u201cmarinade for the shrimp\u201d. Mix well.\n\nTo a wok (preferably), add in a few inches of oil \u2013 enough that you can submerge the shrimp (I use 1-1.5 cups, but you could theoretically work this with \u00bd cup). Over a high flame, heat the oil up until its rapidly bubbling around a pair of chopsticks, or about 165C. Dump the shrimp in and fry until they look visibly cooked, ~45 seconds. Add the pepper and the carrot and give everything a very brief mix. Remove it all, let the oil drain out, and set aside.\n\nFor the broccoli, fill a pot or wok up with water and bring to a boil. Add in ~1 tsp salt (to season) and ~1/2 tbsp oil (for sheen). Add the broccoli and cook until it\u2019s deepened in color, ~1 minute. Remove, and drain. Arrange the broccoli on a serving plate in a circle with the florets placed outwards.\n\nTo do the crystal qian, in a wok (preferably) first longyau \u2013 get it piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil \u2013 here, ~2 tbsp (I used lard) \u2013 and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Flame still off, add in the minced aromatics and tip the flame to medium-low. Fry until fragrant, ~30 seconds.\n\nUp the flame to high. Swirl in the wine and give everything a quick mix. Add in the \u201cLiquid for the Crystal Qian\u201d. Bring it up to a rapid boil, then down to a simmer. In a thin stream, drizzle the slurry in while stirring constantly. The goal is a shade before spoon-coating consistency \u2013 add more starch if you\u2019re not at that point.\n\nAdd the shrimp, carrot and peppers. Mix everything well with the sauce. Drizzle in the toasted sesame oil, mix, and toss on the broccoli.\n\n## Brown Sauce\n\nOkay. So then \u201cChinese white sauce\u201d is literally just stock that\u2019s seasoned and thickened with a slurry. So then\u2026 what about brown sauce?\n\nThere is, of course, plenty of \u2018brown-ish\u2019 stir-fries that\u2019re thickened in the same way \u2013 probably too many to count \u2013 cross crossing a whole smorgasbord of various flavor profiles. But that\u2019s not what Martin Yan or Woks of Life are referring to in their recipes: they\u2019re talking about this thing that restaurants mix in advance and use as \u2018mother sauce\u2019 for various dishes.\n\nWhich, of course, certainly exists in China too \u2013 it\u2019s called *tiaowei jiangyou* (\u8c03\u5473\u9171\u6cb9), i.e. \u201cseasoned soy sauce\u201d. \n\nYou see, if you cook Chinese food quite a bit, you\u2019ll often find yourself reaching for a bunch of ingredients over and over: soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, MSG, maybe oyster sauce, maybe stock\u2026 whatever. Chinese restaurants, meanwhile, are highly efficient operations built from the ground up to save **time** (the real primary purpose of those high output restaurant burners, as an aside). For dishes that have overlap or are common across your menu, one time-saving trick is to pre-mix those oft-repeated components. A very clear example of the practice is seasoned soy sauce for seafood (i.e. the stuff drizzled over a Cantonese steamed fish), which\u2019s almost always pre-mixed and [is actually that you can just buy](https://usa.lkk.com/en/products/seasoned-soy-sauce-for-seafood). \n\nSo a seasoned soy sauce *is* this so-called \u201cmother sauce\u201d that your takeout restaurant is reaching for. But different restaurants are different, and have different needs. A Sichuan noodle vendor\u2019s seasoned soy sauce could be steeped with spices. A Chuka restaurant in Japan might include gyofun and ketchup. \n\n## One possible Cantonese Seasoned Soy Sauce\n\nOf course, plenty of restaurants don\u2019t employ a seasoned soy sauce in their kitchen. And when it comes to home cooks in China, it\u2019d be extremely rare to see. \n\nWe don\u2019t use one, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that\u2019s *all* that relevant for most home cooks. But still, as the enduring popularity of pre-mixed \u201cstir fry sauces\u201d in the anglosphere proves, there\u2019s certainly a sub category of people that the mise makes sense for. So if you want? Go for it.\n\nQuick note that I designed this seasoned soy sauce in order to be used directly in the following recipe. If you were a restaurant, you\u2019d likely want to reduce this down to concentrate the flavors \u2013 if you\u2019d like to used this roughly akin to how you\u2019d season with soy sauce, let it boil and reduce by half.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. *Dried Shiitake (\u51ac\u83c7), 1*\n2. *Water, 1 cup.*\n3. *Ginger, 1 inch.* Smashed.\n4. *Scallion, 1 sprig* Tied in a knot.\n5. *Soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), 4 tsp*\n6. *Oyster sauce (\u869d\u6cb9), 1 tbsp*\n7. *Liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), 1 tbsp\n8. *Dry Seasoning: Sugar, 1 tsp; Chicken Bouillon Powder (\u9e21\u7c89), \u00bc tsp; Salt, 1/8 tsp; MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), 1/8 tsp.*\n\n**Process:**\n\nSoak the shiitake in cool water overnight (or alternatively, in hot boiled water for ~30 minutes). Squeeze the liquid from the shiitake, then strain the soaking liquid into a pot. Snip the shiitake with scissors into the pot, and then also toss in the ginger and scallion.\n\nBring everything up to a boil, then down to a simmer. Cover, and let everything infuse over a low flame for ~15 minutes.\n\nAfter that time, shut off the heat and remove the mushroom and the aromatics \u2013 placing them in a bowl to let them cool down. Add in all your other seasoning and mix. Once the mushroom and aromatics are cool enough to handle, squeeze every last drop into the pot of now-seasoned soy sauce and discard. Bring everything up to a boil once last time, and reserve.\n\nThis should yield you roughly \u00be cup of seasoned soy sauce. If using for the following recipe, supplement with water if it reduced beyond that point.\n\n## How to Make \u201cBrown Sauce\u201d \u2013 i.e. a seasoned soy sauce thickened with a Qian\n\nI do think that there might still be a miscommunication here. When I\u2019ve seen Martin Yan or Art of Cooking discuss \u2018brown sauce\u2019, what they\u2019re referring to is a seasoned soy sauce like the one above.\n\nWhen I see people on Reddit inquiring about brown sauce, they seem to be talking about the *final sauce* that\u2019s, say, smothered over their Egg Foo Young. \n\nThese are, again, two different things. \n\nLike, you can obviously use a seasoned soy sauce in plenty of dishes, beyond just stuff that has a \u2018gravy-like\u2019 consistency (e.g. the seasoned soy sauce for seafood like the one discussed above). And you also certainly don\u2019t need a pre-prepared seasoned soy sauce to make something like that \u2018gravy\u2019 for Egg Foo Young (plenty of restaurants will also opt for a step-by-step approach). \n\nSo it\u2019s a little hard to give a recipe for \u2018brown sauce\u2019 like we did for \u2018white sauce\u2019, because there\u2019s nothing universal here. That said, I can already here some echos \u201cshut up already Chris, enough with your prefacing, just give me something that I could use to hit the brown-sauce-sized hole in my gullet\u201d. And to that end, what you could do is: \n\n1. Fry up some aromatics (any combination of garlic/ginger/scallion whites that makes sense) \n2. Swirl in some Shaoxing wine \n3. Add in that seasoned soy sauce from above \n4. Thicken with a slurry, just like the crystal qian above.\n\nIf in the context of a stir fry, again, your order-of-operations is sort of up to you \u2013 you could add in your other ingredients pre-thickening, or post. As an example, you could take a look at Beef and Broccoli, which\u2019s probably the obvious choice:\n\n* [Our recipe on the topic](https://youtu.be/i-fU6MCPZ2M?si=MXUhkyQIYXLbFKgh&t=463)\n* [Art of Cooking\u2019s recipe](https://youtu.be/kjTcuBJz-zs?si=jYQiQ2xgYpSlfe-L&t=407)\n\nLet\u2019s change it up though and show you another possible application:\n\n## Beef and Straw mushrooms, served over rice noodles\n\nBeef and Straw mushrooms (\u8349\u83c7\u725b\u8089) is a classic Cantonese stir fry that can take on a few different forms. I wanted to show something saucier here, so I significantly increased the water quantity from what we\u2019d usually do (in order to get something a bit closer to what folks might imagine from a \u201cbrown sauce heavy\u201d dish). When things are *that* saucy though, they\u2019re just crying to be smothered over rice noodles, so that\u2019s the route I went with here.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. *Beef, 250g.* Loin, flank, or top round.\n2. *Marinade for the beef: salt, \u00bc tsp; sugar, \u00bd tsp; soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), \u00bc tsp; dark soy sauce (\u8001\u62bd), \u00bc tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), \u00bd tsp; oyster sauce (\u869d\u6cb9), 1 tsp; white -or- black pepper, 1/8 tsp; sodium carbonate -or- Kan sui, \u00bc tsp (preferably) -or- baking soda, \u00bd tsp; starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 1 tsp; water, 3 tbsp; egg white, \u00bd; oil, 1 tbsp.* The other half of the egg white will go with the eggs when frying the rice noodles.\n3. *Straw mushrooms (\u8349\u83c7) -or- Shiitake mushrooms (\u9999\u83c7) -or- whatever mushrooms, 250g.*\n4. *For the blanching liquid: salt; 1 tsp; oil, ~1 tbsp*\n5. *Fresh Pad See Ew noodles, 500g.* I used fresh Pad See Ew noodles because we live in Thailand \u2013 this was what I tested. Fresh Hor Fun would have been better, and preferred. If using Dried Hor Fun, use ~300g.\n6. *Egg, 2.* One full egg plus what was leftover from the marinade.\n7. *Beansprouts, ~50g.*\n8. *Seasoning for the rice noodles: soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), 1 tsp; salt, 1/8 tsp; sugar, 1/8 tsp; water, 2 tbsp.* Water-heavy because Pad See Ew noodles are difficult to coat evenly.\n9. *Ginger, ~1 inch.* Smashed.\n10. *Scallions, 2.* White and green portions separated, both cut into ~1.5 inch sections\n11. *Seasoned soy sauce from above.* See the note below if you don\u2019t want to make a separate seasoned soy sauce.\n12. *Slurry: 2.5 tsp starch mixed with 2 tbsp water.*\n13. *Toasted sesame oil (\u9ebb\u6cb9), ~1 tsp.* To finish.\n14. *White -or- black pepper powder, \u00bc tsp.* To finish. \n\nNote: if you don\u2019t feel like going through the whole song and dance of making a seasoned soy sauce, simply soak a shiitake as above. Once you get to the final stir fry, add the shiitake soaking liquid instead of the seasoned soy sauce. Add in all the ingredients from the seasoned soy sauce recipe minus the aromatics, and then continue on with this recipe.\n\n**Process:**\n\nSmash the ginger. Separate the scallions into the whites and greens, cutting each into ~1.5 inch sections. If your straw mushrooms are small, halve them; if they\u2019re large or you\u2019re using shiitakes, slice into ~1cm sheets.\n\nThinly slice the beef into 2-3mm sheets. Add all the ingredients for the marinade except the oil and mix very well, making sure the water is absorbed into the beef. Add the oil and mix to coat. Set aside for 10-15 minutes to allow the alkaline to tenderize the beef.\n  \nAdd the salt and oil to a pot of water. Boil the mushrooms until cooked, ~2 minutes. Reserve.\n\nTo a wok (preferably), add in a few inches of oil \u2013 enough that you can submerge the beef (I use 1-1.5 cups, but you could theoretically work this with \u00bd cup). Over a high flame, heat the oil up until its rapidly bubbling around a pair of chopsticks, or about 165C. Dump the beef in and fry until it looks visibly cooked, ~45 seconds. Remove, let the oil drain out, and set aside.\n\nNext, frying up some rice noodles. Do this however you\u2019re comfortable. But for me, first I loosened up the rice noodles and set them on a plate. Then, to a wok with the flame on maximum, after a quick longyau with ~2 tbsp oil, I tossed in the beaten eggs. Once they\u2019re good and scrambled, I went in with the Pad See Ew noodles. Pad See Ew noodles love to clump, so if you\u2019re going that route too be sure to continuously spread the noodles outward from the center of the wok. Once the noodles have just *barely* started to brown (1-2 minutes), flip and continue with the other side. Then swirl the liquid seasoning in, continuously mixing and spreading the noodles to avoid clumping. Add in the beansprouts, stir fry for ~30 seconds. Move over to a plate.\n\nScrape out the wok, and *longyau* again \u2013 again, ~2 tbsp oil. Over a high flame, fry the ginger and scallion until fragrant, ~15 seconds, then swirl in the wine. After a quick mix, go in with the seasoned soy sauce. Bring it up to a boil and then down to a simmer, then drizzle in the slurry while stirring constantly. Add in the beef and mushrooms, mix well. Finish with the toasted sesame oil and white (or black) pepper, and smother it all over the stir fried rice noodles.\n\n## Note on Order of Operations\n\nYou\u2019ve got three choices on when to add your pre-cooked ingredients *back* to the final stir fry:\n\n1.\t**After you fry the aromatics and swirl in the wine, before adding the liquid**. The advantage of adding the ingredients at this stage is that you can give the ingredients a brief stir fry \u2013 they\u2019ll take on the subsequent flavors a touch better. \n2.\t**After you add the liquid, before you thicken**. Less common, but will give the ingredients a change to mingle with the liquid before thickening. \n3.\t**After you thicken**. Allows you to most clearly see the stage of the sauce and how thick it is before mixing.\n\nIn almost all of our recipes, we opt for the first choice. In these recipes I went with the last one in order to most clearly show the qian technique.\n\nBut you can also add different ingredients at different times. Maybe you want to add the beef after the aromatics (to give it a bit of a stir fry, or perhaps a chance to mix with some sizzling soy sauce seared against the side of the wok), and the mushrooms at the very end (as mushrooms really love to leech water and mess up the final sauce consistency).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/170i505/is_chinese_brown_sauce_a_thing_in_china_too_the/", "created_utc": 1696512783.0, "score": 120, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/170i505/is_chinese_brown_sauce_a_thing_in_china_too_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The only thing I need is for the book to be available for purchase or download in the US somehow (otherwise I can't actually access the book).  Thank you!\n\nNote, I bought a book called \"Anhui Mountain\" by a \"Stella A. Brooks\" that claims to have recipes from Henan, but I was clearly scammed because it's just AI crap, without any real recipes.  Unfortunately, that was the only book I was able to find.

{"title": "Simple Dumpling Filling Recipes! Might make a part 2 featuring more fancy/difficult ones", "selftext": "I have a lot of recipes for dumpling fillings because I've been helping both my maternal and paternal grandmas make dumplings, all kinds of dumplings, since I was 12 years old. I don't remember if it was in this sub or another one, but someone asked for dumpling filling recipes and well.... I'm a couple of days late but, here you go. Simple dumpling filling recipes!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09w8orcc6fpe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fe8abaf72f21f6a3144cdfb9c311e673159147a\n\n**1. Pork and chinese celery dumplings** \\- [Recipe here (without egg)](https://thewoksoflife.com/pork-and-celery-dumplings/#recipe). My family also adds 1 raw egg into the pork, celery and carrot mixture. It's also common to add chopped up shiitake mushrooms to these. There's a version of this recipe where the ingredients are minced pork (or chicken), chives, mushrooms and wood ear fungus (and 1 raw egg).\n\n**2. Pork and napa cabbage dumplings** \\- [Recipe here (without egg)](https://redhousespice.com/pork-cabbage-dumpling/#recipe). My family also adds 1 raw egg. The dried shrimp in the recipe is optional but it adds an extra shrimp-y, salty kick to the flavor. It's also common to add chopped up shiitake mushrooms to these. There's a version of this recipe where it's minced pork + shrimp, napa cabbage, mushroom and a lot of scallions. Meaning, minced shrimp (so finely minced until it's like a paste) is added to the minced pork and mix together with chopped up napa cabbage, mushrooms and a lot of scallions (and 1 raw egg).\n\n**3. Cantonese pork with mushroom, black wood ear fungus, and water chestnut dumplings** \\- Recipe [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ7bnhC_ryo). You can also replace the pork with minced chicken. There's a version of this dumpling where it's minced pork + shrimp, black wood ear fungus, shredded carrots and minced onions (but this version isn't Cantonese).\n\n**4. Pork and fennel Dumplings** \\- [Recipe here](https://delishhomecook.com/2021/09/21/pork-fennel-dumplings/).\n\n**5. Beef and chinese celery dumplings** \\- [Recipe here](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/chinese-beef-dumplings-with-celery/#recipe). Sometimes, we also add shredded carrot to the recipe for color. Another version of this dumpling, but with lots of scallions [here](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-beef-dumplings/#recipe). The Chinese celery or scallions can also be replaced with chives and there are versions where filling contains both scallions and chives. Also, the recipe for the hot and sour soup for the beef dumplings [here](https://redhousespice.com/beef-dumplings-soup/#recipe).\n\n**6. Lamb and coriander dumplings** \\- [Recipe here](https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/moms-best-lamb-dumplings#wprm-recipe-container-15416). But instead of zucchini, my family puts in both coriander and scallions. Plus also 5 spice powder. We serve these lamb dumplings with the same hot and sour soup for beef dumplings above.\n\n**7. Shrimp, carrot, corn and broccoli dumplings**. This one was a viral recipe on China's internet space a couple of years back because kids love this one. Making these shrimp dumplings made me the favourite aunt among my nieces and nephews. How to make the filling:\n\nMarinate the raw shrimp with ginger juice for a couple of hours.\n\nFinely mince the raw shrimp until it looks like a paste. Make sure that the minced shrimp covers at least 1/3 of the ingredients (or slightly more), while the remaining 2/3 is made out of shredded carrot, corn, broccoli.\n\nBlanch the carrot, corn and broccoli before cutting them up. The carrots must be finely shredded. The corn must be in kernel form. The broccoli must be very finely chopped up. Also finely mince some onions, ginger and garlic until they look like a paste.\n\nMix everything with salt, white pepper, a teensy bit of sugar, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil like in the recipe for Pork and Chinese Celery Dumplings (but without Shaoxing wine).\n\n**8. Dried shrimps, eggs and chives dumplings.**\n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of this one but anyways... How to make the filling:\n\nScramble some eggs with salt, white pepper and finely minced garlic and set it aside. Once done, chop up the scrambled eggs into tiny pieces.\n\nSoak some dried shrimp in a water solution made out of water and some ginger juice for a few minutes (approximately 5-6 minutes) until the dried shrimp don't look so dry anymore. Take out the dried shrimp, and squeeze them to get rid of excess water. Then chop all of them up.\n\nMix the chopped up eggs and dried shrimp with chopped up chives, salt, white pepper, light soy sauce and sesame oil.\n\n**9. Minced chicken with shiitake mushroom and shredded carrot dumplings.** For instructions, refer to pork and chinese celery dumpling recipe at no. 1. There's a version of this dumpling where it's minced chicken + shrimp with shiitake mushrooms and shredded carrots. Sometimes, scallions are added too.\n\n**10. Minced pork, lotus root and corn dumplings.**\n\nHow to make the filling:\n\nMarinate the minced pork with salt, pepper, light soy sauce and hoisin sauce overnight.\n\nThrow some freshly cleaned chopped up lotus root into the blender and blend it until it looks finely minced.\n\nMix the marinated minced pork, blended lotus root, corn kernels evenly with 1 raw egg, finely minced garlic and ginger, white pepper, a teensy bit more light soy sauce (optional), a bit of Shaoxing wine and sesame oil.\n\nThere is a version of this dumpling where it is minced pork + chicken with lotus root and corn.\n\n**11. Minced pork and shrimp with corn, shredded carrot and scallions dumpling.**\n\nHow to make the filling:\n\nThe corn must be in kernel form.\n\nMarinate the raw pork and shrimp with ginger juice for a couple of hours before throwing both into a blender or chopping them up finely to make a pork and shrimp paste.\n\nAlso finely mince some onions, ginger and garlic until they look like a paste.\n\nMix everything with salt, white pepper, a teensy bit of sugar, light soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil and Shaoxing wine.\n\nThere is a version of this dumpling where finely sliced red chilli is also added. To make the filling a little spicy.\n\n**12. Minced beef and shrimp with shiitake mushrooms and shredded carrot.** This recipe follows number 11. With the exception that on top of hoisin sauce, oyster sauce and a tiny bit of dark soy sauce are also added. The dark soy sauce is for color. There is a version of this dumpling where on top of everything else, coriander or chinese celery is also added.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1je2y1v/simple_dumpling_filling_recipes_might_make_a_part/", "created_utc": 1742298055.0, "score": 17, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1je2y1v/simple_dumpling_filling_recipes_might_make_a_part/", "html_title": ""}

Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, and place a light weight on top for about 10 minutes to help press out excess moisture. Once pressed, slice it into cubes of roughly 2\u20133 cm. In a bowl, combine the chilli powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the tofu, stirring gently so each piece is coated. Allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\n\n   Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the ends, and cut it into wedges\u2014aim for around 6\u20138 wedges per onion, depending on its size. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers, then chop them into bite-sized chunks of about 2\u20133 cm. Set the vegetables aside while the tofu marinates.\n\n2. Warm 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. If using cumin seeds, add them first and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Tip in the tofu cubes (along with any remaining marinade) and fry for 5\u20136 minutes, turning occasionally, until they become lightly golden. Transfer the tofu to a plate.\n\n3. Add the onion wedges, green pepper, and red pepper to the same pan. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes, allowing the edges to caramelise lightly for extra depth of flavour. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Sprinkle in the ground coriander and garam masala, tossing the vegetables until they\u2019re well coated. Add the chopped tomatoes or passata, followed by the tomato pur\u00e9e and sugar. Season with \u00bd teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste). Let the sauce simmer for about 5\u20137 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\n\n5. Return the golden tofu cubes to the pan, folding them into the sauce so each piece is evenly coated. Add the chopped fresh coriander and stir. Cook for another 1\u20132 minutes to ensure the tofu absorbs all the flavours.\n\n6. Taste the sauce and adjust it according to your preference\u2014add more salt, chilli, or a pinch of sugar if needed. Garnish with extra fresh coriander.

{"title": "A quick thought and curiosity on Chinese food and its many forms of flavour, as well as looking for culinary advice on sweet and umami recipes", "selftext": "To start out, I\u2019ve never been a big cook of Chinese food outside of literally 1 Chinese American staple (scallion noodles), but I have always been fascinated with Chinese food and learning how to cook it, from a casual love of American-Chinese when I was a kid to my growing curiosity in dishes outside the west.\nThe pitfall I come to is the latter category, where because of China\u2019s great culinary diversity, I just do not know where to start. Moreso, I realized the reason my search was failing for recipes I might like was because I didn\u2019t know how to articulate what sort of cooking I was looking for in the first place. There are many flavours in Chinese cuisine, and when someone looks for \u201cauthentic Chinese\u201d recipes and ideas, they\u2019re looking at a crazy amount of everything and anything, from the spiciness and stir fried of Sichuan cuisine to the seafood of Cantonese, and it seemed like none of it was quite what I was looking for in terms of flavour. However, I realize what I\u2019ve been looking for is healthy sweet and umami dishes with minimal ingredients, lots of veggies, less oil/stir fries, and hopefully noodle soup and dumpling dishes as well. Btw when I say sweet I mean with sweeter ingredients like certain sweet meats, sweeter tasting vegetables and fruits, lighter spices, not necessarily added cane/rock sugar. A far cry from my childhood orders of fried noodles and Mongolian beef but this is genuinely what I\u2019m really curious about. \n\nI\u2019m asking this question here not just for recipes (which are appreciated nonetheless) but for guidance. How do I narrow my search for Chinese dishes I might like? Are there regional cuisines that fit this profile? What should I cook to satisfy this craving? I hope this question isn\u2019t too vague, I am just very lost in this amazing world of Chinese cuisine.

Choosing and prepping the duck.", "selftext": "Okay, this one is a lot more complicated than I expected and I've tried my best to translate my grandma's recipe.\n\nHere's my grandma's Cantonese roast duck recipe as requested by a Redditor a few days ago. My grandma used to work as a chef in Cantonese restaurants in Guangzhou in her younger days and this is her sharing the recipe and all her duck roasting tips/hacks she learned throughout the years.\n\n**Choosing the right raw duck:**\n\nTechnically, any duck, frozen or freshly butchered will do but the perfect kind of duck are ones with the following criteria:\n\n* Regular white feathered meat ducks known as Pekin Duck or White Pekin Duck in English. De-feathered, cleaned and with all its innards removed.\n* Preferably between 2.5kg to 3.1kg, but we can also work with smaller or bigger ducks. Smaller ducks are easier to roast than bigger ones.\n* Plump (not too scrawny and not too fat)\n* Young female duck (softer meat/more tender) so that its skin is thinner, more delicate and firmer which is perfect for crispy duck skin\n* Preferably still has its neck and head but we can also work with ones that already had its head chopped off (headless raw ducks are more common in western countries)\n\n**Why a young, plump, female duck? Because...**\n\n1. Older ducks have tougher skin, with more visible fat layers right below the skin. Older ducks also have more sallow looking, flabby or looser skin. All of that affects the quality, taste and appearance of the skin when you roast it.\n2. Male ducks are bigger and leaner than female ducks, and bigger sizes are tricker to roast (Temperatures needed to be adjusted more than once while roasting). The meat of male ducks, being leaner than females also makes it less ideal to achieve that soft, tender and juicy Cantonese roast taste.\n3. Why the duck must be plump? Too scrawny and you don't get a lot of juicy meat. Plus you also get wrinkly duck skin (no fats to \"fill up\" the duck and smoothen skin creases). Scrawnier ducks with less fat also don't produce a lot of meat juices when roasted. But too fat and all the extra fat will make it all too greasy in a bad way.\n\n**\u203c\ufe0f From Google Images: You want a duck that looks like Pic 1** (Woks of Life) **and 2** (Viet Kitchen) **in this post and not like Pic 3** (Preciouscore.com)\n\nThe duck from Pic 3 is an older duck (loose, flabby, sallow and tough looking skin) and it is too fat. That yellow/sallow discoloration on most of the body except the limbs is actually the visible fat layers right under the skin and that's too much fat.\n\nIn Pic 1 and 2, you can see that the duck, while plump, is leaner than the duck in Pic 3. Also the skin of the duck in Pic 1 and 2 are thinner looking, more delicate, less visible fat layers and the outline of the duck's muscles are visible.\n\n**Prepping the raw duck:**\n\n* Open up the duck cavity and if there are globs of fat and leftover guts within, remove them.\n* Clean the duck again because there'll still be some bloody residue inside the duck and maybe even on some parts of its skin (despite having bought a duck that has already been cleaned). Rinse the insides of the duck cavity thoroughly. If you accidentally left any blood or bloody residue or leftover duck guts in the cavity, it'll ruin the taste of the roast.\n* Cut off the duck's legs at its \"knees\"\n* Cut off the duck's wings at the \"elbows\" / Cut off the wing tips.\n* Place the duck on a wire rack above a tray or use meat hooks to hang up the duck by its neck or its wings to air-dry for 1-2 hours. Or place a table fan near the duck to speed up the process. If you use a fan, then it only takes 1 hour\n\n[PART 2 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 3 OF THE RECIPE (END)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3s2tf0j88hne1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31687445aabebaeaf1f0f6a7460443db9f9b0b0d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x949r9p98hne1.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfa3d5eb4780db8841340b3abdd979db6645324f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1abqdmta8hne1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=287b40be51bb32a2235747c833a574f885f7b6fd", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741443417.0, "score": 19, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "PART 3: Grandma's Guangdong province style Cantonese roast duck recipe. Basing the duck, air-drying and roasting.", "selftext": "**Bas**t**ing the duck in maltose liquid / Giving the duck a maltose and red vinegar bath:**\n\n**Duck bath/basting water (enough to fill one BIG stainless steel stock pot)- Ingredients**\n\n* 3 to 4 tablespoons of honey\n* 8 to 10 tablespoons of [Chinese maltose](https://thewoksoflife.com/maltose/)\n* 500ml \u767d\u918b (white vinegar)\n* 500ml of [\u5927\u7ea2\u6d59\u918b (big red vinegar)](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-ingredients-glossary/chinese-sauces-vinegars-oils/#red-zhejiang-vinegar) or \u7ea2\u6d59\u918b (red vinegar) if you can't find the other one. If you can get ones from Zhejiang, China. That's even better.\n* 100ml of [Shaoxing Huadiao wine](https://www.malafood.com/en/the-ultimate-guide-to-chinese-cooking-wines)\n\n*If you don't have enough of the ingredients above (like if they are too expensive to buy in large amounts), see the list of instructions below for another way to baste/bathe the duck with less ingredients.*\n\n**How to baste/bathe the duck in maltose and red vinegar water? Instructions:**\n\n11. Fill a big stainless steel stock pot with water, enough to cover the entire duck. Put in all the ingredients from the list above. Stir the mixture and ensure that everything melts. Bring the water to a boil then turn off the heat.\n\n12. There are 2 methods to baste/bath the duck: 1.) [Lift the duck by the meat hook over the stock pot and then, one ladle at a time, pour the boiled watery mixture evenly over every inch of the duck a couple of times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AHD_ykPnDY). Or, 2.) Holding the top of the hook, dunk the entire duck up and down into the watery mixture a couple of times (like dunking a tea bag into hot water). **Do this for at least 10 minutes.**\n\n13. As you pour the watery mixture over the duck or as you dunk the duck into the water, you'll notice that the duck skin starts to shrink and tighten with every ladle/dunk. Keep ladling the hot watery mixture or keep dunking the duck until 1.) You are sure that every part of the duck has been covered by the mixture, and 2.) The duck's skin look tight all over. Every single nook and cranny.\n\n14. Discard the water.\n\nNow, if you don't have a big stock pot enough to dunk the entire duck in or you don't have enough of the ingredients to make a giant mixture of duck basting liquid, then:\n\n15. Just baste/bathe the duck in plain boiled hot water with a splash of white vinegar, and some green onions and ginger slices thrown in. Ladle the water over the duck or dunk the duck into the water repeatedly until the skin all over the duck looked tightened. **Do this for at least 10 minutes.**\n\n16. Then prepare a bowl of water mixed with the smaller amounts of the ingredients listed above for the duck bath and just pour the watery mixture over every inch of the duck. Make sure the liquid covers every single nook and cranny of the duck. Again, **do this for at least 10 minutes** to make sure that you thoroughly cover the duck skin with the maltose and red vinegar water. Once done, discard the water.\n\nFYI - This process of basting the duck or giving the duck a \"bath\" with maltose and red vinegar water helps in giving the duck a nice Chinese roast color during the roast later on.  Any missed areas (areas not covered by the maltose and red vinegar water) will not have a nice roast color so make sure you don't miss any spots.\n\nThe hot boiled water also helps remove any gamey duck smell and tighten up the duck skin so that when it's roasted, you'd have smooth crispy duck skin.\n\n**Air-dry the duck:**\n\n17. Hang up the duck to air-dry naturally for 12 to 24 hours or speed up the process by placing a table fan facing the duck and let the wind from the fan dry the duck for 8 to 10 hours (8 hours is fine).\n\n18. After the duck has been completely air-dried, then it's ready to be roasted. Touch the skin of the duck to make sure it is 100% dried. Make sure there are no damp spots like, in between skin creases or under the duck's \"armpits\" etc.\n\n19. If by the time your duck has dried and it's already late in the day, then refrigerate the duck and continue with the roast in the morning. Don't put it in the freezer, just put it in the regular side of the fridge so that it'll keep the duck chilled but not frozen.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n20. About 2-3 hours before roasting, take the duck out of the fridge and let it sit for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature. A cold duck won\u2019t roast evenly.\n\n21. Pre-heat the oven to 190\u00b0C. (My grandma said you can adjust the roasting temperature if you want to. The ideal temperature should be between 175\u00b0C to 195\u00b0C).\n\n22. Place the duck on a wire rack in the center of the oven. Place a large roasting pan at the bottom of the oven to collect any duck juices that may leak out while the duck roasts. Add half cup of hot water to the bottom of the pan to prevent any drippings from smoking as the duck roasts.\n\n23. Roast the duck for 45 to 50 minutes. Halfway through (about 20+ minutes), flip the duck so that both sides get roasted evenly.\n\n24. Once done, remove the duck from the oven, tent it with a piece of aluminum foil (large enough to cover the whole thing) and let it rest for approximately 20 to 25 minutes before serving.\n\n**Serve the duck:**\n\n25: When it is time to serve the duck, remove the skewer sealing the cavity and carefully pour all the fat and juices into a bowl. Remember to pour the juices through a fine-mesh strainer to catch any unwanted clumps.\n\n26. With a cleaver, cut the duck in half lengthwise from the top of the breast down through to one side of the backbone. Remove any aromatics in the cavity and discard.\n\n27. Cut off the stumpy wings. Also cut off the neck and the head. Discard these parts.\n\n28. Now, make a lengthwise cut along the backbone of one half of the duck (the half with the backbone attached) to remove the backbone.\n\n29. Cut everything up into bite-sized pieces. Cut the legs like you would drumsticks.\n\n30. Serve with duck meat with a dipping sauce. The duck juices can serve as a dipping sauce too.\n\nDipping sauce recipes [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j4hkab/comment/mgadjil/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j4hkab/comment/mgadkr3/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n[PART 1 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 2 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvfjbz0k8hne1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bf3780ecc51dea106a240c9d6cdbe9e3c2d198d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741444265.0, "score": 16, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "PART 2: Grandma's Guangdong province style Cantonese roast duck recipe. Seasoning, sealing the duck cavity and inflating the duck", "selftext": "**Ingredients for marinating the duck:**\n\n**Feel free to adjust the measurements according to your preference.**\n\n**Duck cavity - Ingredients for the dry rub:**\n\n* 2 teaspoons of [dried tangerine peel](https://thewoksoflife.com/make-dried-tangerine-peel/) powder: Take a couple of dried tangerine peel pieces and lightly roasted them by tossing the pieces into a pan or a wok without oil and roast them for a minute or two. Then, throw the lightly roasted dried tangerine peel into a blender and blend it into powder.\n* 4 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder\n* 2 teaspoons of MSG (optional)\n* 30 grams of [\u5341\u4e09\u9999 (Chinese 13 spices)](https://adragonchef.com/the-five-spice/) \\--> with this ingredient, you don't need to add various aromatics individually like star anise, clove, Sichuan peppercorns etc.\n* 20 grams white sugar\n* 20 grams salt\n\nInstructions: Mix all of the above thoroughly in a small bowl and set aside.\n\n**Duck cavity - Ingredients for the wet rub:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon of Baijiu (but you can also use Shaoxing wine, especially [Shaoxing Huadiao](https://www.malafood.com/en/the-ultimate-guide-to-chinese-cooking-wines))\n* 15 grams of unsalted peanut butter (optional)\n* 15 grams of [\u829d\u9ebb\u9171 (sesame paste)](https://theplantbasedwok.com/chinese-sesame-paste/), also known as tahini but buy the Chinese version\n* 15 grams of [\u7d05\u8150\u4e73 (red fermented bean curd sauce)](https://zenzendream.com/product/haitian-classic-red-fermented-bean-curd-288g-%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%A9%E8%85%90%E4%B9%B3%E7%BB%8F%E5%85%B8%E7%BA%A2%E6%96%B9/)\n* 25 grams of [\u8c46\u8c49\u9171 (Black bean sauce)](https://redhousespice.com/black-bean-sauce/). If I'm not mistaken [LKK has the regular black bean sauce](https://usa.lkk.com/en/products/black-bean-sauce) and another black bean and and garlic version. You can use either one. The original recipe calls for the regular one.\n* 25 grams of [\u8bf8\u4faf\u9171 (zhu hou sauce)](https://thewoksoflife.com/chee-hou-sauce/)\n* 25 grams of hoisin sauce\n* 25 grams of oyster sauce\n* 25 grams of light soy sauce\n* 35 to 40 grams of [fried minced garlic](https://www.seriouseats.com/crispy-fried-garlic-garlic-oil)\n\nInstructions: Mix all of the above thoroughly in a small bowl and set aside.\n\n**Duck cavity - Extra ingredients:**\n\n* A couple of green onions stalks\n* A couple of slices of ginger\n\n**Seasoning and sealing the duck cavity:**\n\n1. Rub the inside of the duck cavity thoroughly with the dry rub mixture from above. Make sure you cover every single nook and cranny inside the duck with the dry rub. Be generous with it. You don't have to use all the dry rub mixture on the duck because there'll definitely be excess. Just keep the extra unused powder to marinate something else.\n\n2. Do the same thing with the wet rub, as in, thoroughly coat the inside of the duck cavity with the sauce. Make sure you cover every single nook and cranny inside the duck with it. Be generous. Again, you don't have to use all the wet rub mixture on the duck because there'll definitely be excess. Just keep the extra unused sauce to marinate something else.\n\n3. Stuff the green onion stalks and ginger slices into the duck cavity as well.\n\n4. Stitch up the duck with a metal skewer like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_e4-3zQErM) to prevent the seasonings in the duck cavity from leaking out (and to prevent the duck juices from leaking out during the roast). Make sure you stitch up the flaps of the skin tightly. Lift the duck up to check to see if anything leaks out and redo if necessary (if you didn't do it tight enough).\n\n5. If you bought a duck without its neck and head (common thing if you're from a western country), then also stitch up the flap where the head should be with a metal skewer like in the [video link above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_e4-3zQErM).\n\n**Inflate the duck:**\n\n**FYI - You can also inflate the duck AFTER you have basted the duck/given the duck a maltose and red vinegar bath. See part 3 for instructions on how to baste the duck.** \n\nIt is **A LOT EASIER** to inflate the duck before basting the duck/before the maltose and red vinegar bath so my grandma recommends that you do it before the basting step. Since, most of you aren't trained Cantonese chefs with years of experience.\n\nSome Cantonese chefs inflate the duck after basting because they're skilled enough to tell which parts of the duck skin needed more \"help\" to look perfectly smooth even after the basting process (because sometimes, even after the duck skin tightens up from the basting, it still doesn't look smooth enough because of creases). So they know how to target those places on the skin that needed more \"help\" when it comes to inflating the duck. \n\n6. There should be a hole at the bottom of the duck head on the neck (where the duck was slaughtered). Insert a clean plastic tube attached to a small electric air pump (or you can use a [plastic handheld balloon pump](https://partymakersgreenville.com/shop/balloons/balloon-accessories/plastic-balloon-pump/)) into the hole on the neck. Hold the folds of the neck skin close around the tube to create a seal so that air won't leak out as you pump. [Like at 4:45 in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2qwqX3VQL4). If your duck does not have the neck still attached, then the opening at the neck is very large, seal a portion of the opening using skewers or butcher\u2019s twine before inserting the tube.\n\n7. Pump air in until you see the skin separating from the meat, all the way down to the leggy stumps. As the air is pumped under the skin, the duck will swell almost like a balloon.\n\n8. Flip the duck over and repeat this process because you need to inflate both sides of the duck.\n\n9. When the duck has been completely inflated on both sides, With the pump still attached, take a [6- to 8-inch/15-20cm length of butcher's twine](https://www.amazon.com/Vivifying-Cotton-Bakers-Cooking-Sausage/dp/B071V6VGG9/) and tie a knot around the neck of the duck, below where the pump is to seal in the air inside the duck. Then remove the pump.\n\n10. If you have a meat hook, then hook the duck up by its neck. <--- Preferred way. Or, if your duck does not have its neck and head attached, then hook the duck up by its \"armpits\".\n\nFYI - Inflating the duck will smoothen creases and wrinkles in the skin, it also separates the skin from the meat so it'll be easier to make the skin crispy during the roast.\n\nThis process is why my grandma advise against using older ducks for this recipe. Because older ducks have more skin creases and wrinkles so you'll have to do this process multiple times. Once after seasoning and sealing the duck cavity. Once after basing the duck in maltose liquid. Sometimes, one more time before the roast (if the duck is very old and big) and that is so inconvenient.\n\n[PART 1 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 3 OF THE RECIPE (END)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741443696.0, "score": 9, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Recipe Included In The Comments", "selftext": "[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-dumplings-in-chilli-oil)\n\nIngredients: \n\nFor the Filling\n* 200 g firm tofu\n* 100 g mushrooms, finely chopped (shiitake or cremini work well)\n* 2 spring onions, finely sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* \u00bd teaspoon salt\n* \u00bc teaspoon black pepper\n\nFor the Dumplings\n* 24 vegan dumpling wrappers \n\nFor the Chilli Oil Sauce\n* 3 tablespoons chilli oil (shop-bought or homemade)\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)\n* 1 tablespoon black vinegar (or rice vinegar)\n* 1 teaspoon sugar (or maple syrup)\n* 1 clove garlic, finely grated (optional)\n\nFor the Garnish\n* Chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) or microgreens\n* Toasted sesame seeds\n\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Place a heavy object (like a tofu press cast-iron pan or a few books) on top for about 10\u201315 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Once pressed, crumble it into small pieces\u2014aim for a texture similar to minced meat or small curds.\n2. Finely chop the mushrooms into small, even pieces so they cook quickly and distribute well in the filling. Thinly slice the spring onions, using both the white and green parts. Mince the garlic (or use a garlic press), and grate the ginger finely.\n3. In a\u00a0large mixing bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, chopped mushrooms, spring onions, minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper. Stir until everything is evenly incorporated. This forms your dumpling filling.\n4. Place a dumpling wrapper on a flat surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of filling into the centre. Dip your finger in water and run it along the edges of the wrapper. Fold and seal, pressing firmly to ensure no air pockets remain. You can pleat the edges or simply press them together\u2014choose whichever method you prefer, as long as the filling is fully enclosed.\n5. In a small bowl, whisk together the chilli oil, soy sauce, black vinegar, sugar, and grated garlic (if using). Set aside.\n6. Fill a steamer with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Line the steamer basket with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Place the dumplings inside, leaving a little space between them so they cook evenly. Steam for 6\u20138 minutes, or until the wrappers become translucent and the filling is cooked through. If you prefer a different cooking method, see the alternatives below for oven or grill, boiling, or air frying.\n7. While the dumplings are still hot, place them in a shallow bowl. Drizzle generously with the prepared chilli oil sauce, ensuring it seeps into every fold. Garnish with fresh coriander or microgreens and toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately and enjoy!\n\n\nAlternative cooking methods:\n\n* High-Heat Oven or Grill: Preheat your oven or grill to a very high setting (ideally around 370\u00b0C/700\u00b0F, if possible). Lightly brush or spray a tray with oil to prevent sticking. Arrange the dumplings on the tray and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the wrappers become lightly golden and crisp around the edges. The intense heat helps create a slightly charred flavour.\n\n* Boiling: Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil. Carefully drop in the dumplings and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain immediately, then serve with the chilli oil sauce.\n\n* Air Fryer:\u00a0Lightly coat the dumplings with oil. Air fry at 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F) for 8\u201310 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Toss or drizzle with the sauce right before serving.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ccfgl1fna9me1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1740912494.0, "score": 54, "author": "Whiterabbit2000", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j1o8x8/you_have_to_try_these_delicious_flavour_packed/", "html_title": ""}

Recipes online always come out dry.", "selftext": "When I was eating in Hong Kong, the typical meal was served as a kind of soup you could say, with noodles, and then chicken breast or beef (often tender) in a sauce. The vegetables were a little fried sometimes, but often soft/boiled. The flavour profile came out in slices of thin ginger and aromatics like garlic, chilli. Maybe bean sprouts and others like peppers to spurce it up. It's too hot to drink at the start, but by the end delicious to drink or consume with a large plastic spoon. Let me share my love for this cusine: It was healthy, but not too strong that it sat in your stomache, and you could control the aromatics/chilli to avoid it affecting you (or your partner!). I enjoyed it and felt healthy. It really didn't feel like there was much soy sauce, frying, salt or oyster style going on.\n\nI found one place in the UK where they made something like this but they shut down. All the takeaways around me make very salty, dry, fried style food. Designed for chop sticks, not spoons.\n\nHere is the \"cooking problem\": I know about Sichuan style noodle soups. When I try to produce this in the UK, at least with ingredients I have found, the water never dissolves correctly. It's separate or the oil or flavour seperates, and comes to the top, etc. I am struggling to bring the taste into the water/infuse it well. I have tried boiling meats then using the water, or sauteeing vegetables, then putting water into that followed by salty meats fried seperately.\n\nAnd online, I cannot find much english speaking content showing how to cook this. People sauteeing vegetables and lightly frying chicken before putting soy sauce on at the end, forgive me if I am wrong, this feels like a westernised version. Can I find the more Hong-Kong style anywhere online? How do I cook it? Is it like forming a stock with the vegetables and meat, and serving that up?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1iyk1j7/how_to_make_actual_liquidysoupy_cantonese_style/", "created_utc": 1740563638.0, "score": 2, "author": "cycleair", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1iyk1j7/how_to_make_actual_liquidysoupy_cantonese_style/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

While these adjustments improved the dish, I still haven\u2019t quite achieved the rich, complex taste found in restaurant versions.\n\nI don\u2019t think maltose is the missing ingredient since it\u2019s mainly used during blanching. There\u2019s something else that brings out that signature depth of flavor, and I\u2019m still figuring out what it is.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1iseatr/trying_to_perfect_chinese_restaurantstyle_chicken/", "created_utc": 1739890025.0, "score": 9, "author": "WarKingJames", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1iseatr/trying_to_perfect_chinese_restaurantstyle_chicken/", "html_title": ""}

The only thing I need is for the book to be available for purchase or download in the US somehow (otherwise I can't actually access the book).  Thank you!\n\nNote, I bought a book called \"Anhui Mountain\" by a \"Stella A. Brooks\" that claims to have recipes from Henan, but I was clearly scammed because it's just AI crap, without any real recipes.  Unfortunately, that was the only book I was able to find.

{"title": "In Search of Soup", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI'm looking for a recipe for a Chinese beef noodle soup from a book I read many years ago in middle school.\u00a0 The book is The Great Wall of Lucy Wu, by Wendy Shang (I even tried reaching out to the author, but received no reply).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve pieced together some details about the soup from the descriptions given in the book, listed below.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it's not much to go off of, so I\u2019m looking for a recipe that\u2019s true to life, that might actually be the soup from someone\u2019s childhood- maybe even the soup from your own childhood, the same way that I love to make the soup that I grew up with.  I'm looking more for personal favorites/family recipes than an exact match (since this seems elusive).\n\nHere\u2019s what we have to work with:\n\n* **The noodles are made with flour and eggs**\n   * *I know what he\u2019s thinking\u2014it\u2019s flour, eggs, and water.\u00a0 The noodles are good, but how good can they be?

{"title": "Simple Dumpling Filling Recipes! Might make a part 2 featuring more fancy/difficult ones", "selftext": "I have a lot of recipes for dumpling fillings because I've been helping both my maternal and paternal grandmas make dumplings, all kinds of dumplings, since I was 12 years old. I don't remember if it was in this sub or another one, but someone asked for dumpling filling recipes and well.... I'm a couple of days late but, here you go. Simple dumpling filling recipes!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09w8orcc6fpe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fe8abaf72f21f6a3144cdfb9c311e673159147a\n\n**1. Pork and chinese celery dumplings** \\- [Recipe here (without egg)](https://thewoksoflife.com/pork-and-celery-dumplings/#recipe). My family also adds 1 raw egg into the pork, celery and carrot mixture. It's also common to add chopped up shiitake mushrooms to these. There's a version of this recipe where the ingredients are minced pork (or chicken), chives, mushrooms and wood ear fungus (and 1 raw egg).\n\n**2. Pork and napa cabbage dumplings** \\- [Recipe here (without egg)](https://redhousespice.com/pork-cabbage-dumpling/#recipe). My family also adds 1 raw egg. The dried shrimp in the recipe is optional but it adds an extra shrimp-y, salty kick to the flavor. It's also common to add chopped up shiitake mushrooms to these. There's a version of this recipe where it's minced pork + shrimp, napa cabbage, mushroom and a lot of scallions. Meaning, minced shrimp (so finely minced until it's like a paste) is added to the minced pork and mix together with chopped up napa cabbage, mushrooms and a lot of scallions (and 1 raw egg).\n\n**3. Cantonese pork with mushroom, black wood ear fungus, and water chestnut dumplings** \\- Recipe [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ7bnhC_ryo). You can also replace the pork with minced chicken. There's a version of this dumpling where it's minced pork + shrimp, black wood ear fungus, shredded carrots and minced onions (but this version isn't Cantonese).\n\n**4. Pork and fennel Dumplings** \\- [Recipe here](https://delishhomecook.com/2021/09/21/pork-fennel-dumplings/).\n\n**5. Beef and chinese celery dumplings** \\- [Recipe here](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/chinese-beef-dumplings-with-celery/#recipe). Sometimes, we also add shredded carrot to the recipe for color. Another version of this dumpling, but with lots of scallions [here](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-beef-dumplings/#recipe). The Chinese celery or scallions can also be replaced with chives and there are versions where filling contains both scallions and chives. Also, the recipe for the hot and sour soup for the beef dumplings [here](https://redhousespice.com/beef-dumplings-soup/#recipe).\n\n**6. Lamb and coriander dumplings** \\- [Recipe here](https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/moms-best-lamb-dumplings#wprm-recipe-container-15416). But instead of zucchini, my family puts in both coriander and scallions. Plus also 5 spice powder. We serve these lamb dumplings with the same hot and sour soup for beef dumplings above.\n\n**7. Shrimp, carrot, corn and broccoli dumplings**. This one was a viral recipe on China's internet space a couple of years back because kids love this one. Making these shrimp dumplings made me the favourite aunt among my nieces and nephews. How to make the filling:\n\nMarinate the raw shrimp with ginger juice for a couple of hours.\n\nFinely mince the raw shrimp until it looks like a paste. Make sure that the minced shrimp covers at least 1/3 of the ingredients (or slightly more), while the remaining 2/3 is made out of shredded carrot, corn, broccoli.\n\nBlanch the carrot, corn and broccoli before cutting them up. The carrots must be finely shredded. The corn must be in kernel form. The broccoli must be very finely chopped up. Also finely mince some onions, ginger and garlic until they look like a paste.\n\nMix everything with salt, white pepper, a teensy bit of sugar, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil like in the recipe for Pork and Chinese Celery Dumplings (but without Shaoxing wine).\n\n**8. Dried shrimps, eggs and chives dumplings.**\n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of this one but anyways... How to make the filling:\n\nScramble some eggs with salt, white pepper and finely minced garlic and set it aside. Once done, chop up the scrambled eggs into tiny pieces.\n\nSoak some dried shrimp in a water solution made out of water and some ginger juice for a few minutes (approximately 5-6 minutes) until the dried shrimp don't look so dry anymore. Take out the dried shrimp, and squeeze them to get rid of excess water. Then chop all of them up.\n\nMix the chopped up eggs and dried shrimp with chopped up chives, salt, white pepper, light soy sauce and sesame oil.\n\n**9. Minced chicken with shiitake mushroom and shredded carrot dumplings.** For instructions, refer to pork and chinese celery dumpling recipe at no. 1. There's a version of this dumpling where it's minced chicken + shrimp with shiitake mushrooms and shredded carrots. Sometimes, scallions are added too.\n\n**10. Minced pork, lotus root and corn dumplings.**\n\nHow to make the filling:\n\nMarinate the minced pork with salt, pepper, light soy sauce and hoisin sauce overnight.\n\nThrow some freshly cleaned chopped up lotus root into the blender and blend it until it looks finely minced.\n\nMix the marinated minced pork, blended lotus root, corn kernels evenly with 1 raw egg, finely minced garlic and ginger, white pepper, a teensy bit more light soy sauce (optional), a bit of Shaoxing wine and sesame oil.\n\nThere is a version of this dumpling where it is minced pork + chicken with lotus root and corn.\n\n**11. Minced pork and shrimp with corn, shredded carrot and scallions dumpling.**\n\nHow to make the filling:\n\nThe corn must be in kernel form.\n\nMarinate the raw pork and shrimp with ginger juice for a couple of hours before throwing both into a blender or chopping them up finely to make a pork and shrimp paste.\n\nAlso finely mince some onions, ginger and garlic until they look like a paste.\n\nMix everything with salt, white pepper, a teensy bit of sugar, light soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil and Shaoxing wine.\n\nThere is a version of this dumpling where finely sliced red chilli is also added. To make the filling a little spicy.\n\n**12. Minced beef and shrimp with shiitake mushrooms and shredded carrot.** This recipe follows number 11. With the exception that on top of hoisin sauce, oyster sauce and a tiny bit of dark soy sauce are also added. The dark soy sauce is for color. There is a version of this dumpling where on top of everything else, coriander or chinese celery is also added.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1je2y1v/simple_dumpling_filling_recipes_might_make_a_part/", "created_utc": 1742298055.0, "score": 19, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1je2y1v/simple_dumpling_filling_recipes_might_make_a_part/", "html_title": ""}

Moreso, I realized the reason my search was failing for recipes I might like was because I didn\u2019t know how to articulate what sort of cooking I was looking for in the first place. There are many flavours in Chinese cuisine, and when someone looks for \u201cauthentic Chinese\u201d recipes and ideas, they\u2019re looking at a crazy amount of everything and anything, from the spiciness and stir fried of Sichuan cuisine to the seafood of Cantonese, and it seemed like none of it was quite what I was looking for in terms of flavour. However, I realize what I\u2019ve been looking for is healthy sweet and umami dishes with minimal ingredients, lots of veggies, less oil/stir fries, and hopefully noodle soup and dumpling dishes as well. Btw when I say sweet I mean with sweeter ingredients like certain sweet meats, sweeter tasting vegetables and fruits, lighter spices, not necessarily added cane/rock sugar. A far cry from my childhood orders of fried noodles and Mongolian beef but this is genuinely what I\u2019m really curious about. \n\nI\u2019m asking this question here not just for recipes (which are appreciated nonetheless) but for guidance. How do I narrow my search for Chinese dishes I might like? Are there regional cuisines that fit this profile? What should I cook to satisfy this craving? I hope this question isn\u2019t too vague, I am just very lost in this amazing world of Chinese cuisine.

Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, and place a light weight on top for about 10 minutes to help press out excess moisture. Once pressed, slice it into cubes of roughly 2\u20133 cm. In a bowl, combine the chilli powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the tofu, stirring gently so each piece is coated. Allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\n\n   Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the ends, and cut it into wedges\u2014aim for around 6\u20138 wedges per onion, depending on its size. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers, then chop them into bite-sized chunks of about 2\u20133 cm. Set the vegetables aside while the tofu marinates.\n\n2. Warm 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. If using cumin seeds, add them first and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Tip in the tofu cubes (along with any remaining marinade) and fry for 5\u20136 minutes, turning occasionally, until they become lightly golden. Transfer the tofu to a plate.\n\n3. Add the onion wedges, green pepper, and red pepper to the same pan. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes, allowing the edges to caramelise lightly for extra depth of flavour. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Sprinkle in the ground coriander and garam masala, tossing the vegetables until they\u2019re well coated. Add the chopped tomatoes or passata, followed by the tomato pur\u00e9e and sugar. Season with \u00bd teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste). Let the sauce simmer for about 5\u20137 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\n\n5. Return the golden tofu cubes to the pan, folding them into the sauce so each piece is evenly coated. Add the chopped fresh coriander and stir. Cook for another 1\u20132 minutes to ensure the tofu absorbs all the flavours.\n\n6.

{"title": "PART 3: Grandma's Guangdong province style Cantonese roast duck recipe. Basing the duck, air-drying and roasting.", "selftext": "**Bas**t**ing the duck in maltose liquid / Giving the duck a maltose and red vinegar bath:**\n\n**Duck bath/basting water (enough to fill one BIG stainless steel stock pot)- Ingredients**\n\n* 3 to 4 tablespoons of honey\n* 8 to 10 tablespoons of [Chinese maltose](https://thewoksoflife.com/maltose/)\n* 500ml \u767d\u918b (white vinegar)\n* 500ml of [\u5927\u7ea2\u6d59\u918b (big red vinegar)](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-ingredients-glossary/chinese-sauces-vinegars-oils/#red-zhejiang-vinegar) or \u7ea2\u6d59\u918b (red vinegar) if you can't find the other one. If you can get ones from Zhejiang, China. That's even better.\n* 100ml of [Shaoxing Huadiao wine](https://www.malafood.com/en/the-ultimate-guide-to-chinese-cooking-wines)\n\n*If you don't have enough of the ingredients above (like if they are too expensive to buy in large amounts), see the list of instructions below for another way to baste/bathe the duck with less ingredients.*\n\n**How to baste/bathe the duck in maltose and red vinegar water? Instructions:**\n\n11. Fill a big stainless steel stock pot with water, enough to cover the entire duck. Put in all the ingredients from the list above. Stir the mixture and ensure that everything melts. Bring the water to a boil then turn off the heat.\n\n12. There are 2 methods to baste/bath the duck: 1.) [Lift the duck by the meat hook over the stock pot and then, one ladle at a time, pour the boiled watery mixture evenly over every inch of the duck a couple of times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AHD_ykPnDY). Or, 2.) Holding the top of the hook, dunk the entire duck up and down into the watery mixture a couple of times (like dunking a tea bag into hot water). **Do this for at least 10 minutes.**\n\n13. As you pour the watery mixture over the duck or as you dunk the duck into the water, you'll notice that the duck skin starts to shrink and tighten with every ladle/dunk. Keep ladling the hot watery mixture or keep dunking the duck until 1.) You are sure that every part of the duck has been covered by the mixture, and 2.) The duck's skin look tight all over. Every single nook and cranny.\n\n14. Discard the water.\n\nNow, if you don't have a big stock pot enough to dunk the entire duck in or you don't have enough of the ingredients to make a giant mixture of duck basting liquid, then:\n\n15. Just baste/bathe the duck in plain boiled hot water with a splash of white vinegar, and some green onions and ginger slices thrown in. Ladle the water over the duck or dunk the duck into the water repeatedly until the skin all over the duck looked tightened. **Do this for at least 10 minutes.**\n\n16. Then prepare a bowl of water mixed with the smaller amounts of the ingredients listed above for the duck bath and just pour the watery mixture over every inch of the duck. Make sure the liquid covers every single nook and cranny of the duck. Again, **do this for at least 10 minutes** to make sure that you thoroughly cover the duck skin with the maltose and red vinegar water. Once done, discard the water.\n\nFYI - This process of basting the duck or giving the duck a \"bath\" with maltose and red vinegar water helps in giving the duck a nice Chinese roast color during the roast later on.  Any missed areas (areas not covered by the maltose and red vinegar water) will not have a nice roast color so make sure you don't miss any spots.\n\nThe hot boiled water also helps remove any gamey duck smell and tighten up the duck skin so that when it's roasted, you'd have smooth crispy duck skin.\n\n**Air-dry the duck:**\n\n17. Hang up the duck to air-dry naturally for 12 to 24 hours or speed up the process by placing a table fan facing the duck and let the wind from the fan dry the duck for 8 to 10 hours (8 hours is fine).\n\n18. After the duck has been completely air-dried, then it's ready to be roasted. Touch the skin of the duck to make sure it is 100% dried. Make sure there are no damp spots like, in between skin creases or under the duck's \"armpits\" etc.\n\n19. If by the time your duck has dried and it's already late in the day, then refrigerate the duck and continue with the roast in the morning. Don't put it in the freezer, just put it in the regular side of the fridge so that it'll keep the duck chilled but not frozen.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n20. About 2-3 hours before roasting, take the duck out of the fridge and let it sit for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature. A cold duck won\u2019t roast evenly.\n\n21. Pre-heat the oven to 190\u00b0C. (My grandma said you can adjust the roasting temperature if you want to. The ideal temperature should be between 175\u00b0C to 195\u00b0C).\n\n22. Place the duck on a wire rack in the center of the oven. Place a large roasting pan at the bottom of the oven to collect any duck juices that may leak out while the duck roasts. Add half cup of hot water to the bottom of the pan to prevent any drippings from smoking as the duck roasts.\n\n23. Roast the duck for 45 to 50 minutes. Halfway through (about 20+ minutes), flip the duck so that both sides get roasted evenly.\n\n24. Once done, remove the duck from the oven, tent it with a piece of aluminum foil (large enough to cover the whole thing) and let it rest for approximately 20 to 25 minutes before serving.\n\n**Serve the duck:**\n\n25: When it is time to serve the duck, remove the skewer sealing the cavity and carefully pour all the fat and juices into a bowl. Remember to pour the juices through a fine-mesh strainer to catch any unwanted clumps.\n\n26. With a cleaver, cut the duck in half lengthwise from the top of the breast down through to one side of the backbone. Remove any aromatics in the cavity and discard.\n\n27. Cut off the stumpy wings. Also cut off the neck and the head. Discard these parts.\n\n28. Now, make a lengthwise cut along the backbone of one half of the duck (the half with the backbone attached) to remove the backbone.\n\n29. Cut everything up into bite-sized pieces. Cut the legs like you would drumsticks.\n\n30. Serve with duck meat with a dipping sauce. The duck juices can serve as a dipping sauce too.\n\nDipping sauce recipes [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j4hkab/comment/mgadjil/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j4hkab/comment/mgadkr3/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n[PART 1 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 2 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvfjbz0k8hne1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bf3780ecc51dea106a240c9d6cdbe9e3c2d198d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741444265.0, "score": 15, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "PART 2: Grandma's Guangdong province style Cantonese roast duck recipe. Seasoning, sealing the duck cavity and inflating the duck", "selftext": "**Ingredients for marinating the duck:**\n\n**Feel free to adjust the measurements according to your preference.**\n\n**Duck cavity - Ingredients for the dry rub:**\n\n* 2 teaspoons of [dried tangerine peel](https://thewoksoflife.com/make-dried-tangerine-peel/) powder: Take a couple of dried tangerine peel pieces and lightly roasted them by tossing the pieces into a pan or a wok without oil and roast them for a minute or two. Then, throw the lightly roasted dried tangerine peel into a blender and blend it into powder.\n* 4 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder\n* 2 teaspoons of MSG (optional)\n* 30 grams of [\u5341\u4e09\u9999 (Chinese 13 spices)](https://adragonchef.com/the-five-spice/) \\--> with this ingredient, you don't need to add various aromatics individually like star anise, clove, Sichuan peppercorns etc.\n* 20 grams white sugar\n* 20 grams salt\n\nInstructions: Mix all of the above thoroughly in a small bowl and set aside.\n\n**Duck cavity - Ingredients for the wet rub:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon of Baijiu (but you can also use Shaoxing wine, especially [Shaoxing Huadiao](https://www.malafood.com/en/the-ultimate-guide-to-chinese-cooking-wines))\n* 15 grams of unsalted peanut butter (optional)\n* 15 grams of [\u829d\u9ebb\u9171 (sesame paste)](https://theplantbasedwok.com/chinese-sesame-paste/), also known as tahini but buy the Chinese version\n* 15 grams of [\u7d05\u8150\u4e73 (red fermented bean curd sauce)](https://zenzendream.com/product/haitian-classic-red-fermented-bean-curd-288g-%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%A9%E8%85%90%E4%B9%B3%E7%BB%8F%E5%85%B8%E7%BA%A2%E6%96%B9/)\n* 25 grams of [\u8c46\u8c49\u9171 (Black bean sauce)](https://redhousespice.com/black-bean-sauce/). If I'm not mistaken [LKK has the regular black bean sauce](https://usa.lkk.com/en/products/black-bean-sauce) and another black bean and and garlic version. You can use either one. The original recipe calls for the regular one.\n* 25 grams of [\u8bf8\u4faf\u9171 (zhu hou sauce)](https://thewoksoflife.com/chee-hou-sauce/)\n* 25 grams of hoisin sauce\n* 25 grams of oyster sauce\n* 25 grams of light soy sauce\n* 35 to 40 grams of [fried minced garlic](https://www.seriouseats.com/crispy-fried-garlic-garlic-oil)\n\nInstructions: Mix all of the above thoroughly in a small bowl and set aside.\n\n**Duck cavity - Extra ingredients:**\n\n* A couple of green onions stalks\n* A couple of slices of ginger\n\n**Seasoning and sealing the duck cavity:**\n\n1. Rub the inside of the duck cavity thoroughly with the dry rub mixture from above. Make sure you cover every single nook and cranny inside the duck with the dry rub. Be generous with it. You don't have to use all the dry rub mixture on the duck because there'll definitely be excess. Just keep the extra unused powder to marinate something else.\n\n2. Do the same thing with the wet rub, as in, thoroughly coat the inside of the duck cavity with the sauce. Make sure you cover every single nook and cranny inside the duck with it. Be generous. Again, you don't have to use all the wet rub mixture on the duck because there'll definitely be excess. Just keep the extra unused sauce to marinate something else.\n\n3. Stuff the green onion stalks and ginger slices into the duck cavity as well.\n\n4. Stitch up the duck with a metal skewer like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_e4-3zQErM) to prevent the seasonings in the duck cavity from leaking out (and to prevent the duck juices from leaking out during the roast). Make sure you stitch up the flaps of the skin tightly. Lift the duck up to check to see if anything leaks out and redo if necessary (if you didn't do it tight enough).\n\n5. If you bought a duck without its neck and head (common thing if you're from a western country), then also stitch up the flap where the head should be with a metal skewer like in the [video link above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_e4-3zQErM).\n\n**Inflate the duck:**\n\n**FYI - You can also inflate the duck AFTER you have basted the duck/given the duck a maltose and red vinegar bath. See part 3 for instructions on how to baste the duck.** \n\nIt is **A LOT EASIER** to inflate the duck before basting the duck/before the maltose and red vinegar bath so my grandma recommends that you do it before the basting step. Since, most of you aren't trained Cantonese chefs with years of experience.\n\nSome Cantonese chefs inflate the duck after basting because they're skilled enough to tell which parts of the duck skin needed more \"help\" to look perfectly smooth even after the basting process (because sometimes, even after the duck skin tightens up from the basting, it still doesn't look smooth enough because of creases). So they know how to target those places on the skin that needed more \"help\" when it comes to inflating the duck. \n\n6. There should be a hole at the bottom of the duck head on the neck (where the duck was slaughtered). Insert a clean plastic tube attached to a small electric air pump (or you can use a [plastic handheld balloon pump](https://partymakersgreenville.com/shop/balloons/balloon-accessories/plastic-balloon-pump/)) into the hole on the neck. Hold the folds of the neck skin close around the tube to create a seal so that air won't leak out as you pump. [Like at 4:45 in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2qwqX3VQL4). If your duck does not have the neck still attached, then the opening at the neck is very large, seal a portion of the opening using skewers or butcher\u2019s twine before inserting the tube.\n\n7. Pump air in until you see the skin separating from the meat, all the way down to the leggy stumps. As the air is pumped under the skin, the duck will swell almost like a balloon.\n\n8. Flip the duck over and repeat this process because you need to inflate both sides of the duck.\n\n9. When the duck has been completely inflated on both sides, With the pump still attached, take a [6- to 8-inch/15-20cm length of butcher's twine](https://www.amazon.com/Vivifying-Cotton-Bakers-Cooking-Sausage/dp/B071V6VGG9/) and tie a knot around the neck of the duck, below where the pump is to seal in the air inside the duck. Then remove the pump.\n\n10. If you have a meat hook, then hook the duck up by its neck. <--- Preferred way. Or, if your duck does not have its neck and head attached, then hook the duck up by its \"armpits\".\n\nFYI - Inflating the duck will smoothen creases and wrinkles in the skin, it also separates the skin from the meat so it'll be easier to make the skin crispy during the roast.\n\nThis process is why my grandma advise against using older ducks for this recipe. Because older ducks have more skin creases and wrinkles so you'll have to do this process multiple times. Once after seasoning and sealing the duck cavity. Once after basing the duck in maltose liquid. Sometimes, one more time before the roast (if the duck is very old and big) and that is so inconvenient.\n\n[PART 1 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 3 OF THE RECIPE (END)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741443696.0, "score": 9, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "PART 1: Grandma's Guangdong province style Cantonese roast duck recipe. Choosing and prepping the duck.", "selftext": "Okay, this one is a lot more complicated than I expected and I've tried my best to translate my grandma's recipe.\n\nHere's my grandma's Cantonese roast duck recipe as requested by a Redditor a few days ago. My grandma used to work as a chef in Cantonese restaurants in Guangzhou in her younger days and this is her sharing the recipe and all her duck roasting tips/hacks she learned throughout the years.\n\n**Choosing the right raw duck:**\n\nTechnically, any duck, frozen or freshly butchered will do but the perfect kind of duck are ones with the following criteria:\n\n* Regular white feathered meat ducks known as Pekin Duck or White Pekin Duck in English. De-feathered, cleaned and with all its innards removed.\n* Preferably between 2.5kg to 3.1kg, but we can also work with smaller or bigger ducks. Smaller ducks are easier to roast than bigger ones.\n* Plump (not too scrawny and not too fat)\n* Young female duck (softer meat/more tender) so that its skin is thinner, more delicate and firmer which is perfect for crispy duck skin\n* Preferably still has its neck and head but we can also work with ones that already had its head chopped off (headless raw ducks are more common in western countries)\n\n**Why a young, plump, female duck? Because...**\n\n1. Older ducks have tougher skin, with more visible fat layers right below the skin. Older ducks also have more sallow looking, flabby or looser skin. All of that affects the quality, taste and appearance of the skin when you roast it.\n2. Male ducks are bigger and leaner than female ducks, and bigger sizes are tricker to roast (Temperatures needed to be adjusted more than once while roasting). The meat of male ducks, being leaner than females also makes it less ideal to achieve that soft, tender and juicy Cantonese roast taste.\n3. Why the duck must be plump? Too scrawny and you don't get a lot of juicy meat. Plus you also get wrinkly duck skin (no fats to \"fill up\" the duck and smoothen skin creases). Scrawnier ducks with less fat also don't produce a lot of meat juices when roasted. But too fat and all the extra fat will make it all too greasy in a bad way.\n\n**\u203c\ufe0f From Google Images: You want a duck that looks like Pic 1** (Woks of Life) **and 2** (Viet Kitchen) **in this post and not like Pic 3** (Preciouscore.com)\n\nThe duck from Pic 3 is an older duck (loose, flabby, sallow and tough looking skin) and it is too fat. That yellow/sallow discoloration on most of the body except the limbs is actually the visible fat layers right under the skin and that's too much fat.\n\nIn Pic 1 and 2, you can see that the duck, while plump, is leaner than the duck in Pic 3. Also the skin of the duck in Pic 1 and 2 are thinner looking, more delicate, less visible fat layers and the outline of the duck's muscles are visible.\n\n**Prepping the raw duck:**\n\n* Open up the duck cavity and if there are globs of fat and leftover guts within, remove them.\n* Clean the duck again because there'll still be some bloody residue inside the duck and maybe even on some parts of its skin (despite having bought a duck that has already been cleaned). Rinse the insides of the duck cavity thoroughly. If you accidentally left any blood or bloody residue or leftover duck guts in the cavity, it'll ruin the taste of the roast.\n* Cut off the duck's legs at its \"knees\"\n* Cut off the duck's wings at the \"elbows\" / Cut off the wing tips.\n* Place the duck on a wire rack above a tray or use meat hooks to hang up the duck by its neck or its wings to air-dry for 1-2 hours. Or place a table fan near the duck to speed up the process. If you use a fan, then it only takes 1 hour\n\n[PART 2 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 3 OF THE RECIPE (END)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3s2tf0j88hne1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31687445aabebaeaf1f0f6a7460443db9f9b0b0d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x949r9p98hne1.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfa3d5eb4780db8841340b3abdd979db6645324f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1abqdmta8hne1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=287b40be51bb32a2235747c833a574f885f7b6fd", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741443417.0, "score": 19, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": ""}

Recipe Included In The Comments", "selftext": "[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-dumplings-in-chilli-oil)\n\nIngredients: \n\nFor the Filling\n* 200 g firm tofu\n* 100 g mushrooms, finely chopped (shiitake or cremini work well)\n* 2 spring onions, finely sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* \u00bd teaspoon salt\n* \u00bc teaspoon black pepper\n\nFor the Dumplings\n* 24 vegan dumpling wrappers \n\nFor the Chilli Oil Sauce\n* 3 tablespoons chilli oil (shop-bought or homemade)\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)\n* 1 tablespoon black vinegar (or rice vinegar)\n* 1 teaspoon sugar (or maple syrup)\n* 1 clove garlic, finely grated (optional)\n\nFor the Garnish\n* Chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) or microgreens\n* Toasted sesame seeds\n\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Place a heavy object (like a tofu press cast-iron pan or a few books) on top for about 10\u201315 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Once pressed, crumble it into small pieces\u2014aim for a texture similar to minced meat or small curds.\n2. Finely chop the mushrooms into small, even pieces so they cook quickly and distribute well in the filling. Thinly slice the spring onions, using both the white and green parts. Mince the garlic (or use a garlic press), and grate the ginger finely.\n3. In a\u00a0large mixing bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, chopped mushrooms, spring onions, minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper. Stir until everything is evenly incorporated. This forms your dumpling filling.\n4. Place a dumpling wrapper on a flat surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of filling into the centre. Dip your finger in water and run it along the edges of the wrapper. Fold and seal, pressing firmly to ensure no air pockets remain. You can pleat the edges or simply press them together\u2014choose whichever method you prefer, as long as the filling is fully enclosed.\n5. In a small bowl, whisk together the chilli oil, soy sauce, black vinegar, sugar, and grated garlic (if using). Set aside.\n6. Fill a steamer with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Line the steamer basket with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Place the dumplings inside, leaving a little space between them so they cook evenly. Steam for 6\u20138 minutes, or until the wrappers become translucent and the filling is cooked through. If you prefer a different cooking method, see the alternatives below for oven or grill, boiling, or air frying.\n7. While the dumplings are still hot, place them in a shallow bowl. Drizzle generously with the prepared chilli oil sauce, ensuring it seeps into every fold. Garnish with fresh coriander or microgreens and toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately and enjoy!\n\n\nAlternative cooking methods:\n\n* High-Heat Oven or Grill: Preheat your oven or grill to a very high setting (ideally around 370\u00b0C/700\u00b0F, if possible). Lightly brush or spray a tray with oil to prevent sticking. Arrange the dumplings on the tray and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the wrappers become lightly golden and crisp around the edges. The intense heat helps create a slightly charred flavour.\n\n* Boiling: Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil. Carefully drop in the dumplings and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain immediately, then serve with the chilli oil sauce.\n\n* Air Fryer:\u00a0Lightly coat the dumplings with oil. Air fry at 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F) for 8\u201310 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Toss or drizzle with the sauce right before serving.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ccfgl1fna9me1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1740912494.0, "score": 57, "author": "Whiterabbit2000", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j1o8x8/you_have_to_try_these_delicious_flavour_packed/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to make actual \"liquidy/soupy\" Cantonese style dishes? You eat them with a spoon, they consist of a vegetable base, typically ginger/spring onions/scallions/Pak choi etc? Recipes online always come out dry.", "selftext": "When I was eating in Hong Kong, the typical meal was served as a kind of soup you could say, with noodles, and then chicken breast or beef (often tender) in a sauce. The vegetables were a little fried sometimes, but often soft/boiled. The flavour profile came out in slices of thin ginger and aromatics like garlic, chilli. Maybe bean sprouts and others like peppers to spurce it up. It's too hot to drink at the start, but by the end delicious to drink or consume with a large plastic spoon. Let me share my love for this cusine: It was healthy, but not too strong that it sat in your stomache, and you could control the aromatics/chilli to avoid it affecting you (or your partner!). I enjoyed it and felt healthy. It really didn't feel like there was much soy sauce, frying, salt or oyster style going on.\n\nI found one place in the UK where they made something like this but they shut down. All the takeaways around me make very salty, dry, fried style food. Designed for chop sticks, not spoons.\n\nHere is the \"cooking problem\": I know about Sichuan style noodle soups. When I try to produce this in the UK, at least with ingredients I have found, the water never dissolves correctly. It's separate or the oil or flavour seperates, and comes to the top, etc. I am struggling to bring the taste into the water/infuse it well. I have tried boiling meats then using the water, or sauteeing vegetables, then putting water into that followed by salty meats fried seperately.\n\nAnd online, I cannot find much english speaking content showing how to cook this.

Both my father (RIP) and mother never bother to descale the fish, never cleaning the fish, and not removing the guts!  If you wonder if they even score the fish?  Nope.  They just plop it on a dish, sprinkle green scallions on it then put it in a steamer all in less than a minute. Then dump soy sauce on it after steaming is done.  My uncle even does this same way, so it extends to other parts of my family.  What we get is a mouthful of scales, guts, and bones, all trying to get to consume the fishmeat which is an adventure.  That is NOT a good eating experience and its messy at the table.  Too many times I get the inside of my mouth pierced with fish bones.  My family can't be alone on this method of steaming fish with literally no handling, or are they?\n\nWhenever this gets served at any Chinese restaurant, I always pass on this dish.\n\nJust curious on what everyone's view here on steamed fish...\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1i7u7le/do_you_love_or_dread_eating_chinese_steamed_fish/", "created_utc": 1737602696.0, "score": 34, "author": "Odd_Yogurtcloset_649", "num_comments": 85, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1i7u7le/do_you_love_or_dread_eating_chinese_steamed_fish/", "html_title": ""}

Every place I've tried the chicken is not prepared well. Either overcooked or fatty (or both) and I got tired of trying new spots and decided to try making it myself... I wish I had tried cooking it from scratch sooner! Now to preface this next part, I have a culinary background, I went to school for it for years, but I ultimately decided it wasn't the career I wanted because I love the creative aspect of it too much and can't be bothered with cooking the same things repeatedly and using recipes. So here I am, making sesame chicken for the first time, and it was probably my favorite version of the dish of I've ever had! I've always been intimidated by dishes I'd never made in school and that I didn't grow up learning components of (I'm white and I grew up mostly eating very American foods, so a lot of things really) and over the past few years I've been branching out and overcoming that feeling. This experience has gotten me inspired to keep cooking new dishes this year.\n\nTLDR: The recipe I \"used\" is https://recipessmile.com/honey-sesame-chicken-sweet-savory-simple/ but I don't measure, I eyeball everything, add more or less based on the flavors I tend to prefer, and also taste along the way and adjust. \n\nThis is me telling you to try cooking your favorite takeout meal, I think it will probably taste better than most restaurants (unless you will catch the kitchen on fire then please don't try)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i38xnz", "created_utc": 1737090056.0, "score": 1, "author": "CatsAndConfections", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1i38xnz/i_got_tired_of_looking_for_a_good_chinese_takeout/", "html_title": ""}
