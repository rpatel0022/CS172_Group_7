Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar dissolves, let it cool, then pour it into a container w/ thin sliced red onions. I also added garlic and a chili pepper. Usually I add peppercorns too but I didn't have enough without emptying my grinder so I skipped them. Let them chill in the fridge with the potatoes and chicken \ud83d\ude06\n\nMake the kbbq sauce and a few strips of crispy bacon and set it all aside. \n\nUse the bacon fat to make a roux, add milk, bring to a simmer, and start adding cheese. I used a mix of oaxaca and cheddar. Once the cheese is melted and the sauce starts to get smooth, season it with SPPOG, cumin, chili powder, and gochujang to taste. If it starts to get too thick, add milk as needed, too thin and let it reduce or add more cheese.\n\nSet up your fry station w/ flour, egg, and bread crumbs all seasoned with SPPOG + dried oregano & thyme.\n\nDrain the water from the fries, pat dry, then press into the flour to get a good coat and rack them so they dry a bit before frying. The chicken and onion were both done with the regular flour, egg, bread, fry.\n\nOnce everything is nice and crispy, it's time to assemble this mess on a lightly toasted onion bun. Bacon, chicken dipped in sauce, and a stack of onions. Fill the onion ramekin w/ gochujang queso, sprinkle some bacon and scallions on top, then enjoy with fries! Don't forget to eat the onion ramekin at the end \ud83e\udd23\n\nSince my dogs can't have any of this \ud83d\ude05 they got some plain fries and a chicken sandwich on my girlfriends homemade bread \ud83d\ude06\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6x4yf", "created_utc": 1741486033.0, "score": 18, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1j6x4yf/kbbq_chicken_sandwich_w_gochujang_queso_fries/", "html_title": ""}

Deglaze w/ white wine and add minced chicken, I seasoned it with SPPOG + chili powder & cumin. Brown, add chipotles in adobo sauce and chicken stock then mix and let it simmer until the stock is gone. Taste test and if you want more of a kick, add some more chipotle adobo sauce.\n\nFor the non-meat eaters \ud83e\udd23 skip the bacon and use olive oil for the garlic & onion. Once soft, add the fake beef (I seasoned it the same as the chicken + oregano) cook until browned, then mix in cooked rice and diced tomatoes. Add vegetable broth as needed to keep it from drying out.\n\nWhile the fillings are cooling, cut a hole in the peppers and remove the insides. Stuff as much as you can in each one, I used the round handle end of a wooden spoon to get stuff into the tips. Cover with cheese, I used cheddar on the chicken and mozzarella on the meatless, then bake at 400\u00b0 until the cheese starts to brown. Add bacon bits on the chicken ones and put back in the oven, turned off, to crisp up the bacon a tad.\n\nSprinkle w/ parsley & scallions then enjoy!\n\nI didn't forget about my dogs, but they can't have this so I made them plain chicken breast browned in olive oil, used a ramekin to mold some plain rice, then garnished it with a celery leaf and carrots \ud83d\ude06", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8cija", "created_utc": 1737662558.0, "score": 33, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1i8cija/chipotle_chicken_impossible_beef_poppers/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Steak Tortilla Bowl ft. Beercheese Onion", "selftext": "I like beer, I like cheese, I like onion. So please welcome back the Beercheese Onion!\n\nToday on \"Will it Blackstone?\" Steak Tortilla Bowl ft. Beercheese Onion\n\nI've posted better details for this before so I'll stick to the quick version here.\n\nStart with a round of knifey spoony to hollow out an onion, while playing this game drink at least half a beer, I recommend 1.5 \ud83d\ude02 Get the onion and half beer on to preheat while cooking some bacon and pizza rolls.\n\nI also opted to try out some hand cut fries here so I rubbed them with salt & racked them to start sweating the moisture out.\n\nWhen the bacon is done, use that greasy area to fry some sliced garlic.\n\nMake a roux with bacon fat and flour, if you don't have enough bacon fat you can use butter or tallow. Scoop it up and drop it like it's hot into the deathly hollows of the onion. Stir in some warm beer until the roux starts to combine. Add cheese and cover, I used an Australian sharp cheddar since that's where knifey spoony originated \ud83e\udd23 cover and stir occasionally to keep the cheese melting.\n\nI did this prior with a pita so figured why not try a tortilla bowl? Use some toothpicks to hold the sides together and set it down until it starts to brown. By the time the bottom is brown, it should be stiff enough to remove the toothpicks and still hold shape but you can leave them in until the end. Rack the bowl to keep it warm.\n\nI used olive oil for the fries, heat it up until it starts to lightly smoke, kinda like a heavy coat of seasoning \ud83d\ude02 if necessary keep pulling it away from the drain. If the fries don't sizzle when they hit the oil then it's not hot enough. Brown and toss in some lemon pepper seasoning then rack to keep warm.\n\nSteak was simply rubbed with S&P then brought to room temp before cooking. Slice and fill the bowl, don't forget to save some plain pieces for your dogs!\n\nDump the Beercheese Onion over the steak, top with bacon, fried garlic, and scallions, serve w/ fries and dig in! The beercheese is great for dipping fries in, if you have any left.\n\nDon't discard the onion, chop it up and use it with some leftover steak to make a sandwich or wrap or quesadilla or something else oniony and cheesy \ud83d\ude05\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fz8pwg", "created_utc": 1728416720.0, "score": 6, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1fz8pwg/steak_tortilla_bowl_ft_beercheese_onion/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pizza Pizza", "selftext": "I may not be an aficionadough but this is the yeast I could do...sorry, that was extra cheesy \ud83e\udd23\n\nToday on \"Will it Blackstone?\" It's not delivery or Digiorno \ud83d\ude02\n\nLet's get sauced \ud83e\udd23 (or you can use your favorite)\n\nChop bacon into bits and brown in a bottom of a pot then remove and drain most of the grease, but leave a little in the bottom to cook some onions. Once soft, add garlic and toss around to cook until fragrent. Add San Marzano tomatoes, I usually use 3 cans, but like my height, sometimes I come up short and will sub a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Stir and simmer until the tomatoes start to get soft. Instead of smoking these herbs \ud83d\ude02 put them in the sauce..basil, oregano, parsley, thyme, and bay leaves. Continue to simmer and mash the tomatoes as they cook, just like Kevin's Famous Chili, everybody is going to get to know eachother in the pot. Sauce thickness is a preference and I like mine thick and a little chunky, if you want it thinner you can hit it with a blender. Mix the bacon in and if you want a little kick, add red pepper flakes. I also add some parm to thicken it and because I like the taste it adds if for just dipping stuff in it \ud83d\ude06\n\nI honestly hate making dough, so this is store bought \ud83d\ude05 leave it out to get to room temp, it's easier to handle, doesn't pull back as much after stretching, and will cook through faster, make your crust shapes and set them aside until ready to use.\n\nDepending on what toppings you want, some of this can be skipped. I started with bacon and getting the paw crusts down for my dogs \ud83d\ude06 sorry, I skipped the pizza rolls on this one because, well, because I'm making pizza \ud83d\ude02\n\nRack the bacon off to the side then cook some chicken in the fat, I seasoned it with salt and pepper then threw some onion and garlic on top, plain for my buddies. Brown the chicken then set it aside with the onions/garlic until everything is cooked through. Throw down some corn meal before the dough so it doesn't stick and cover it.\n\nThe side with the dough was turned off and I used the other 2 burners on low, this works pretty good to cook the dough through without burning the bottom, you may have to adjust this for the amount of space you have.\n\nWhen the dough doesn't feel doughy in the middle heat the sauce (mine was refrigerated, but if you just made it then you can skip this) and some slices of mozzarella until they get melty.\n\n2 spatulas work great to scoop up the sauce and cheese, this also makes it easier to stretch the cheese around for better coverage, if you want to add some color, blow it with a torch \ud83e\udd23\n\nAdd your toppings, sprinkle with scallions, parsley, and parm, then check the bottom. If it's not browned, turn that side on high or move it over to the hot side and turn it up until it's done.\n\nSlice, Slice, Baby \ud83d\ude02..or whatever Vanilla Ice said and enjoy! \n\nFor my dogs yo...pumpkin for sauce, plain chicken, carrots for puperoni, and a small piece of parsley to garnish because they fancy like Applebees on date night \ud83e\udd23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvidgz", "created_utc": 1727989793.0, "score": 5, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1fvidgz/pizza_pizza/", "html_title": ""}

Combine chili's, garlic, a pinch of salt, lemon juice, and olive oil, and blend until smoothish. Don't add too much olive oil all at once or it might end up runny.\n\nUsually, I hand chop my chimichurri, but since the blender was out and already spicy I threw it in there. This is one of the few things I measure \ud83e\udd23 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 bunch of parsley, 1 red chili, 1tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 head of garlic, 1/2 shallot, 1 tbsp oregano, salt & pepper to taste.\n\nUse the chimichurri to marinate the steak while making some garlic paste. You could also blend this but it might not come out so thick so I recommend using a mortar & pestle. Start by crushing the garlic then add a small pinch of salt and a squirt of lemon juice. When I say small pinch I mean it \ud83d\ude02 this is really easy to over salt. Once it's starting to mix together add a little olive oil and keep crushing. Too much olive oil and it'll turn to aioli so add a little at a time until you get the desired consistency.\n\nSome people like to parboil potatoes for smashed potatoes, but I was curious how well it'd work if I just racked them to warm up while getting stuff together, heating up some oil, and cooking some bacon..it works pretty alright \ud83d\ude06 once smashable, use the bacon grease covered area to smash and brown.\n\nCut some pearl onions in 4ths but dont go all the way through, spread it out and freeze to firm. Then, batter and fry. My batter was buttermilk, flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Once golden brown set aside on the rack to keep warm.\n\nSkewer the chicken and steak with peppers and onions. You could skip the skewer because of the pita bowl but I didn't know how well that would work so the skewers were my backup plan \ud83d\ude05 but, they do help with flipping to brown and having even ratios of everything instead of everything getting mixed up.\n\nFor the pita bowl, use some toothpicks to pinch and hold the edges together then put it down until the bottom browns and move it to the rack so it doesn't burn. Remove the toothpicks once it's crispy enough to hold its shape...and don't forget some plain steak for the dogs \ud83d\ude01\n\nWhen everything is done cooking, fill the pita bowl with one of the skewers, put a couple mini blooming onions on top of a smashed potato and top with a dab of garlic paste, add some shatta to the sides, top with bacon and scallions, then dig in!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1frqw0z", "created_utc": 1727565627.0, "score": 13, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1frqw0z/steak_chicken_pita_bowl/", "html_title": ""}

I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but this is a pretty tasty and quick snack, if you don't count the time it takes to caramelize onions \ud83e\udd23\n\nOf course, I couldn't forget about my besties \ud83d\udc15 they got plain steak on a plain pita like a mini pizza slice.

Depending on where you shop these are costco flap meat or sirloin strips/tips. Great buy for the price.\n\nI just did a simple salt and pepper rub, also salt and pepper your gravy to taste, the pizza rolls are great for dipping to taste test \ud83d\ude02\n\nOnce the steak is cooked and rested, the gravy and onions should be done.

Keep the heat low and after smashing add some garlic, shallots, basil, oregano, and thyme. Let it cook down until the tomatoes become soft and smash around some more until desired consistency. Remove the stems from the herbs and set the sauce aside. Salt and pepper to taste.\n\nPound a chicken breast flat, coat with flour and egg both seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika, then bread crumbs after the egg. I mixed my bread crumbs with some grated parm and dried italian seasoning.\n\nOn a clean part of the gril heat up some oil over medium-high heat.

Mix until smooth.\n\nKBBQ Sauce - 6 tbsp gochujang, 1 tsp gochugaru, 4 tbsp tamari, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 4 tbsp sugar, 2 tsp sesame oil, 2 tbsp mirin, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2 shots honey whiskey, buncha minced garlic. Simmer the whiskey to cook off the alcohol, reduce heat and combin everything, whisk over low heat until smooth. If you want it thicker let it reduce or add water to thin.\n\nTeriyaki Marinade/Sauce - White wine, mirin, rice vinegar, tamari, mince garlic & onion, ginger, sesame seeds, scallions. I just put all this stuff in a bowl, mix it together, taste it and adjust accordingly lol\n\nI threw the corn on medium-high while I prepped then just left it off to the side at whatever temp I was cooking at.\n\nStart with the teriyaki sauce, set some aside to brush with while cooking, and get the beef in there to marinate. I used a sirloin that was in my freezer, partially frozen is easier to slice thin. Let it marinate while you prep everything else.\n\nMake the other sauces and set them aside.\n\nThe chicken fried rice was some leftover char siu chicken I had in the freezer mixed with rice and tossed together on medium heat with some melted bacon fat.\n\nI wanted a snack so I did the teriyaki beef next but this is the quickest thing to cook so you can do it whenever. Med-high heat toss them on, brush with extra sauce, flip when browned, brush with sauce again, finished when browned on both sides.\n\nOnto the noodz...these weren't precooked, they were dried egg noodles. I let them sit in water for about 20 minutes while I was doing other stuff, this was enough to soften them. Turn the heat to low on one side and in a corner make a wall with some onions around the noodles and squirt chicken stock onto the noods every few min and stir them around.\n\nWhile those are on the side, cook the pork belly. I didn't do much prep wise, just sliced, rubbed with salt, and chilled in the fridge until needed. Start with cold or low heat if it's already been warmed up, this will help render the fat and prevent burning. Once they start turning light brown and getting slightly crispy flip them and repeat. After both sides are done, move them to the side and brush with kbbq sauce. Depending on how hot your top is or how long you leave them on, the sugar in the sauce can burn on the bottom.\n\nBack to the noodz...they should be pretty much done by now, move the noodles into the pork belly fat and add some lo mein sauce with your choice of veggies, this has broccoli, shrooms, carrots, shallots, garlic, onion, sprouts, and snap peas.\n\nFor proper fauxthenticity plate using an old Chinese takeout container \ud83e\udd23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ebcpw5", "created_utc": 1721855374.0, "score": 13, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1ebcpw5/blackstone_lo_mein_pork_belly_chicken_fried_rice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "KBBQ Chicken Sandwich w/ Gochujang Queso & Fries", "selftext": "While this may not be Seoul food, it's Korean-ish BBQ \ud83e\udd23\n\nKBBQ Sauce:\n6 tbsp gochujang\n1 tsp gochugaru (can use chili powder)\n4 tbsp tamari (can use soy sauce)\n1 tbsp apple cider vinegar \n4 tbsp sugar\n2 tsp sesame oil\n2 tbsp mirin (can use sake or white wine w/ sugar)\n1 tbsp brown sugar\n2 shots honey whiskey\nBuncha minced garlic\n\nSimmer whiskey, reduce heat, combine everything and mix until smooth, reduce to thicken or add water to thin.\n\nChicken Marinade: white wine, lemon juice, minced garlic, onion flakes, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, red chili pepper, chill in fridge until ready to fry.\n\nThe fries I like to soak in cold water overnight but a couple hours also works, I also like to use the cold water on the onion, it helps firm it up making it easier to bread & fry.\n\nAnyway, get your potatoes cut and start chillin, make the marinate and throw the chicken in to chill with the potatoes so they don't get lonely \ud83e\udd23\n\nFor the pickled red onions I eyeballed a 1:1 ratio of water:vinegar and added about 1/2 cup of sugar then ground some salt into it. Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar dissolves, let it cool, then pour it into a container w/ thin sliced red onions. I also added garlic and a chili pepper. Usually I add peppercorns too but I didn't have enough without emptying my grinder so I skipped them. Let them chill in the fridge with the potatoes and chicken \ud83d\ude06\n\nMake the kbbq sauce and a few strips of crispy bacon and set it all aside. \n\nUse the bacon fat to make a roux, add milk, bring to a simmer, and start adding cheese. I used a mix of oaxaca and cheddar. Once the cheese is melted and the sauce starts to get smooth, season it with SPPOG, cumin, chili powder, and gochujang to taste. If it starts to get too thick, add milk as needed, too thin and let it reduce or add more cheese.\n\nSet up your fry station w/ flour, egg, and bread crumbs all seasoned with SPPOG + dried oregano & thyme.\n\nDrain the water from the fries, pat dry, then press into the flour to get a good coat and rack them so they dry a bit before frying. The chicken and onion were both done with the regular flour, egg, bread, fry.\n\nOnce everything is nice and crispy, it's time to assemble this mess on a lightly toasted onion bun. Bacon, chicken dipped in sauce, and a stack of onions. Fill the onion ramekin w/ gochujang queso, sprinkle some bacon and scallions on top, then enjoy with fries! Don't forget to eat the onion ramekin at the end \ud83e\udd23\n\nSince my dogs can't have any of this \ud83d\ude05 they got some plain fries and a chicken sandwich on my girlfriends homemade bread \ud83d\ude06\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6x4yf", "created_utc": 1741486033.0, "score": 18, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1j6x4yf/kbbq_chicken_sandwich_w_gochujang_queso_fries/", "html_title": ""}

You could also use one medium sized ring to stuff between and maintain the ring shape but I don't mind extra filling.\n\nChop some bacon and mix it with the chicken and start stuffing, leave a little space for cheese. Press the cheese in to compact the inside, flip and repeat, let it chill in the freezer to firm up while you heat some oil.\n\nCoat with flour, then egg, then add some leftover egg to the leftover flour and mix it until it starts to get chunky, flour again, then fry until crispy.\n\nDrizzle with ranch and sprinkle of scallions then enjoy!\n\nAs for my dogs, they got some plain chicken since they already ate dinner and this was a night snack \ud83e\udd23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gv8c2q", "created_utc": 1732051307.0, "score": 25, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1gv8c2q/buffalo_chicken_onion_ring/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

So please welcome back the Beercheese Onion!\n\nToday on \"Will it Blackstone?\" Steak Tortilla Bowl ft. Beercheese Onion\n\nI've posted better details for this before so I'll stick to the quick version here.\n\nStart with a round of knifey spoony to hollow out an onion, while playing this game drink at least half a beer, I recommend 1.5 \ud83d\ude02 Get the onion and half beer on to preheat while cooking some bacon and pizza rolls.\n\nI also opted to try out some hand cut fries here so I rubbed them with salt & racked them to start sweating the moisture out.\n\nWhen the bacon is done, use that greasy area to fry some sliced garlic.\n\nMake a roux with bacon fat and flour, if you don't have enough bacon fat you can use butter or tallow. Scoop it up and drop it like it's hot into the deathly hollows of the onion. Stir in some warm beer until the roux starts to combine. Add cheese and cover, I used an Australian sharp cheddar since that's where knifey spoony originated \ud83e\udd23 cover and stir occasionally to keep the cheese melting.\n\nI did this prior with a pita so figured why not try a tortilla bowl? Use some toothpicks to hold the sides together and set it down until it starts to brown. By the time the bottom is brown, it should be stiff enough to remove the toothpicks and still hold shape but you can leave them in until the end. Rack the bowl to keep it warm.\n\nI used olive oil for the fries, heat it up until it starts to lightly smoke, kinda like a heavy coat of seasoning \ud83d\ude02 if necessary keep pulling it away from the drain. If the fries don't sizzle when they hit the oil then it's not hot enough. Brown and toss in some lemon pepper seasoning then rack to keep warm.\n\nSteak was simply rubbed with S&P then brought to room temp before cooking. Slice and fill the bowl, don't forget to save some plain pieces for your dogs!\n\nDump the Beercheese Onion over the steak, top with bacon, fried garlic, and scallions, serve w/ fries and dig in! The beercheese is great for dipping fries in, if you have any left.\n\nDon't discard the onion, chop it up and use it with some leftover steak to make a sandwich or wrap or quesadilla or something else oniony and cheesy \ud83d\ude05\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fz8pwg", "created_utc": 1728416720.0, "score": 7, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1fz8pwg/steak_tortilla_bowl_ft_beercheese_onion/", "html_title": ""}

Once soft, add garlic and toss around to cook until fragrent. Add San Marzano tomatoes, I usually use 3 cans, but like my height, sometimes I come up short and will sub a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Stir and simmer until the tomatoes start to get soft. Instead of smoking these herbs \ud83d\ude02 put them in the sauce..basil, oregano, parsley, thyme, and bay leaves. Continue to simmer and mash the tomatoes as they cook, just like Kevin's Famous Chili, everybody is going to get to know eachother in the pot. Sauce thickness is a preference and I like mine thick and a little chunky, if you want it thinner you can hit it with a blender. Mix the bacon in and if you want a little kick, add red pepper flakes. I also add some parm to thicken it and because I like the taste it adds if for just dipping stuff in it \ud83d\ude06\n\nI honestly hate making dough, so this is store bought \ud83d\ude05 leave it out to get to room temp, it's easier to handle, doesn't pull back as much after stretching, and will cook through faster, make your crust shapes and set them aside until ready to use.\n\nDepending on what toppings you want, some of this can be skipped.

Combine chili's, garlic, a pinch of salt, lemon juice, and olive oil, and blend until smoothish. Don't add too much olive oil all at once or it might end up runny.\n\nUsually, I hand chop my chimichurri, but since the blender was out and already spicy I threw it in there. This is one of the few things I measure \ud83e\udd23 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 bunch of parsley, 1 red chili, 1tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 head of garlic, 1/2 shallot, 1 tbsp oregano, salt & pepper to taste.\n\nUse the chimichurri to marinate the steak while making some garlic paste. You could also blend this but it might not come out so thick so I recommend using a mortar & pestle. Start by crushing the garlic then add a small pinch of salt and a squirt of lemon juice. When I say small pinch I mean it \ud83d\ude02 this is really easy to over salt. Once it's starting to mix together add a little olive oil and keep crushing. Too much olive oil and it'll turn to aioli so add a little at a time until you get the desired consistency.\n\nSome people like to parboil potatoes for smashed potatoes, but I was curious how well it'd work if I just racked them to warm up while getting stuff together, heating up some oil, and cooking some bacon..it works pretty alright \ud83d\ude06 once smashable, use the bacon grease covered area to smash and brown.\n\nCut some pearl onions in 4ths but dont go all the way through, spread it out and freeze to firm. Then, batter and fry. My batter was buttermilk, flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Once golden brown set aside on the rack to keep warm.\n\nSkewer the chicken and steak with peppers and onions. You could skip the skewer because of the pita bowl but I didn't know how well that would work so the skewers were my backup plan \ud83d\ude05 but, they do help with flipping to brown and having even ratios of everything instead of everything getting mixed up.\n\nFor the pita bowl, use some toothpicks to pinch and hold the edges together then put it down until the bottom browns and move it to the rack so it doesn't burn. Remove the toothpicks once it's crispy enough to hold its shape...and don't forget some plain steak for the dogs \ud83d\ude01\n\nWhen everything is done cooking, fill the pita bowl with one of the skewers, put a couple mini blooming onions on top of a smashed potato and top with a dab of garlic paste, add some shatta to the sides, top with bacon and scallions, then dig in!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1frqw0z", "created_utc": 1727565627.0, "score": 13, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1frqw0z/steak_chicken_pita_bowl/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Steak & Cheese Pitza", "selftext": "A few days ago I posted about my beer fridge being the perfect temp to dry brine steaks so I put 7 strips in to test over a week, this was the last one...\n\nToday on \"Will it Blackstone?\" Steak Pitza (Pizza + Pita because I like to smoosh words \ud83e\udd23) w/ a side of Goat Cheese Naan\n\nOverall, day 3 was when I noticed a real difference in flavor and there wasn't much change after that so no reason to go a week, shoot for 3 days or go all out and age it for 45+ days.\n\nI started by melting some tallow I saved but any fat/butter will work fine. Cook some onions and fry some garlic to set aside.\n\nCook the steak to your liking, I like it rare as you can see, but if you want well done Hank Hill will politely ask you to leave \ud83e\udd23 \n\nWhile that's cooking, throw a couple slices of mozzarella down to melt and on the other side start warming the pita. \n\nSlice the steak and slide the pita over, put on the onion and garlic, melted cheese, and steak. I drizzled this with a red wine balsamic glaze which was red wine and balsamic vinegar reduced with brown sugar until I liked how sweet it was \ud83d\ude04 top with a sprinkle of scallions and parsley and let the pita crisp up so you can cut it like a pizza, or if you don't want to wait you can just fold it \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe naan bread was something my girl asked for because she had it at a bar with her mom. This was what the balsamic glaze was originally made for (I made it before the steak hence the snacking pizza rolls in the background \ud83d\ude02) caramelize some onions with butter and brown sugar, cover the top of the naan, crumble some goat cheese, this was a garlic and herb version, drizzle with glaze, and sprinkle with some parsley. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but this is a pretty tasty and quick snack, if you don't count the time it takes to caramelize onions \ud83e\udd23\n\nOf course, I couldn't forget about my besties \ud83d\udc15 they got plain steak on a plain pita like a mini pizza slice.

Simmer the whiskey to cook off the alcohol, reduce heat and combin everything, whisk over low heat until smooth. If you want it thicker let it reduce or add water to thin.\n\nTeriyaki Marinade/Sauce - White wine, mirin, rice vinegar, tamari, mince garlic & onion, ginger, sesame seeds, scallions. I just put all this stuff in a bowl, mix it together, taste it and adjust accordingly lol\n\nI threw the corn on medium-high while I prepped then just left it off to the side at whatever temp I was cooking at.\n\nStart with the teriyaki sauce, set some aside to brush with while cooking, and get the beef in there to marinate. I used a sirloin that was in my freezer, partially frozen is easier to slice thin. Let it marinate while you prep everything else.\n\nMake the other sauces and set them aside.\n\nThe chicken fried rice was some leftover char siu chicken I had in the freezer mixed with rice and tossed together on medium heat with some melted bacon fat.\n\nI wanted a snack so I did the teriyaki beef next but this is the quickest thing to cook so you can do it whenever. Med-high heat toss them on, brush with extra sauce, flip when browned, brush with sauce again, finished when browned on both sides.\n\nOnto the noodz...these weren't precooked, they were dried egg noodles. I let them sit in water for about 20 minutes while I was doing other stuff, this was enough to soften them.

I didn't do much prep wise, just sliced, rubbed with salt, and chilled in the fridge until needed. Start with cold or low heat if it's already been warmed up, this will help render the fat and prevent burning. Once they start turning light brown and getting slightly crispy flip them and repeat. After both sides are done, move them to the side and brush with kbbq sauce. Depending on how hot your top is or how long you leave them on, the sugar in the sauce can burn on the bottom.\n\nBack to the noodz...they should be pretty much done by now, move the noodles into the pork belly fat and add some lo mein sauce with your choice of veggies, this has broccoli, shrooms, carrots, shallots, garlic, onion, sprouts, and snap peas.\n\nFor proper fauxthenticity plate using an old Chinese takeout container \ud83e\udd23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ebcpw5", "created_utc": 1721855374.0, "score": 13, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1ebcpw5/blackstone_lo_mein_pork_belly_chicken_fried_rice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Blackstone Chicken Francese w/ Cheese Tortellini", "selftext": "Today on \"Will it Blackstone?\" - Chicken Francese\n\nThe flavor is there, just a little mild since it doesn't simmer down in the sauce like it's supposed to, it would actually be great for a salad or pita. Sure, I could have used a pan but where's the fun in that?\n\nStart with beating your meat, in this case it's a chicken breast.\n\nSeason some flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika then coat the chicken with it.\n\nSlice a lemon, roll and slice some prosciutto, mince a shallot, garlic, and parsley, also slice some garlic and scallions...the slices are optional I like to brown them and add them on top, the crispy chips add a nice little crunch.\n\nButter up one side and on low temp add some room temp cheese tortellini then supersoak it with some chicken stock (water would work too), add stock as needed to keep it from drying out and toss them around occasionally so they cook evenly. \n\nWhile that's cooking, on the other side brown the prosciutto on medium-high temp. Once browned set it aside with the tortellini, and it's also a good time to give it a squirt.\n\nButter up the prosciutto area, dip the chicken in a light coat of egg, then brown on medium-high heat. Flip to brown the otherside and move it to the cooler side, it's fine if it's not cooked through yet.\n\nDeglaze the chicken area with white wine, add garlic, shallots, and a decent amount of butter, mix it around as the butter melts, add lemon slices and squirt chicken stock (another good time to squirt the torts)...keep scraping everything up towards the front until the lemons start to brown and give it another squirt of stock and dab of butter.\n\nCut up the chicken and mix everything together, give it a nice squirt of broth, cover with some lemons, and turn off the heat while you cook some asparagus in butter with the sliced garlic and shallots.\n\nFill a bowl, sprinkle some of the fried garlic and shallots, add as many asparagus as you'd like, sprinkle with parsley, and enjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e7c8gk", "created_utc": 1721417431.0, "score": 5, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/TodayIAte/comments/1e7c8gk/blackstone_chicken_francese_w_cheese_tortellini/", "html_title": ""}
