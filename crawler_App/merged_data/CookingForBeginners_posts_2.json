{"title": "A Super Morbid Reason To Cook", "selftext": "When I was a little kid, my grandma would come for dinner on Sunday and bring apple pie. She would proceed to critique all the reasons her pastry \"didn't turn out\" as the whole family gorged on her objectively delicious apple pie.  Sunday after Sunday, it was not enough flour, or too much shortening or too hot in the oven.  When I think of my grandmother who passed away decades ago I think of that apple pie and her pursuit of this venerable pie in the sky.\n\nCooking meals for people creates memories.  People are far more likely to remember the night you made that lasagna in a snow storm and everyone danced on the table to a well placed Al Green song and third bottle of wine.  You'll eat out thousands of times, trust me, it's the dinners in that stick. \n\nI once heard of a grandparent who knew they were dying and filled three deep freezes full of meals that their family ate for years.  Everyone eating a warming bowl of ham and split pea soup long after your gone is a pretty damn awesome legacy if you ask me.\n\nSo why should you learn to cook? Many reasons but near the top is so you can cook for other people.  So that if you are lucky to get old and crotchety you can complain about your pastry as your family appreciates every last bite.\n\nLove you Granny T,\n\n\\-R\n\nPS: What a great food memory you have?

I just enjoy helping others. \n\nLet me explain my intentions a bit more\n\nI was bored one ~~day~~ week, and I decided to write up a list of all essential items that any kitchen should have. This was meant to help beginners who don't have much or any kitchen hardware, or for those who are looking to upgrade their existing hardware. I decided to also include an \"expanded\" and \"expert\" level of hardware that you will eventually need as well (see the separate tabs on the bottom of the spreadsheet). \n\nI hand-compiled 95 items, and used product recommendations from America's Test Kitchen and Serious Eats to come up with three different options for each item, at three different price points. So there are currently 279 individual items with prices and links to purchase. \n\nI feel pretty good with the range of items, I'd say it's about 95% inclusive. If you spot anything I have missed, feel free to let me know and I will add it.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to highlight this great suggestion from /u/BrooklynNewsie\n\n>If someone here is planning to move out of their own, it\u2019s worth printing out a list like this and posting it on the wall of your new kitchen, add a check mark every time you want to use something from the list you don\u2019t have yet. Highlight it if there is no available substitute to get the job done without that tool. (Obviously make sure you have the absolute basics [pan, spatula, knife, cutting board, grater, fire extinguisher]) When you hit 3 check marks, add it to your shopping list.\n\nEdit 2: Wow! So much great feedback, thank you all so much!\n\nI have made a few updates to the spreadsheet; I added a mandatory column, per many of your requests, which is just what is sounds like, things that are absolutely mandatory and you can't live without. \n\nI added some little pictures as well, because why not. \n\nNext I will be adding some descriptions as to why each item is considered essential, or basically why I think it deserves a spot in your kitchen. I will try to keep my bias out of this. \n\nI will also be creating a list of baking essentials as well. Look for that in a new post within the next week or so. \n\nLastly, if any of you still reading this have any software programming experience, I am looking for some assistance setting up a Python script or Visual Basic code, or whatever, that will auto-update the prices from Amazon. I know Java and some C++, but that's it.

{"title": "Hello everyone !! I work in restaurants and want to share some tips to help any cooks that need them .", "selftext": "1.]  Use a wet cloth under your cutting board to keep the board from slipping on your table or counter . \n\n2.] Use sharp knives and a proper grip !. This can't be stated enough . Sharp knives save fingers and a dull knife can and will glance off the edge of most produce and won't do very much to cut meats . Meaning you will use WAY more force than you need to cut something and potentially cut yourself, also cuts from dull knives hurt worse .\n\nTo grip  the knife properly it does take practice.  The most common way to hold the knife is to pinch the blade where it meets the handle . This like choking up on a baseball bat , it will give you better control over the blade . It may feel a little funny at first though and depending on the knife / your hand size and physical abilities could take some adjustment, either way though it's a good place to start . \n\nNow i know we have all seen the way chefs grip things when they are cutting . Its lovingly known as    \" The Clawww\"  and it too saves precious fingertips from amputation. Not only does the claw give adequate control it also keeps your fingers tips in while cutting . \n\n*** Too make the claw lay your hand out flat.\n\n*** Now bend  your fingers at the middle knuckle and bring your fingertips towards your palm .\n\n*** This completes the claw look . \n\n*** Now when you go to hold produce or meat you want to try and hide your fingernails on whatever  you are cutting.  This will almost create a little wall with your middle and index knuckles. \n\n***. Now comes time to conquer some fear , place the side of the knife against the wall you have made now  you can cut down where you need to make the size you want or you can slice or chop the same way by using your knuckle wall as a guide while keeping your fingertips safe .It takes time to get used to it and you may end up knicking yourself but its way better than the possible alternatives \n\n*** KEEP practicing!! .Knife skills and proper grip are skills that take time ,but they will help save injury no matter where you are cooking \n\n3.] Get yourself a kitchen thermometer and a chart on safe cooking temperatures . Bacteria and food born illness thrive  in whats called the temperature  danger zone . Luckily refrigeration and cooking kill most of it the unsafe pathogens so as long as we are mindful of how we treat our food we can stay healthy. The FDA has great charts and info on this i suggest reading over some or all of it . \n\nThe second reason too use the thermometer is to control when your food is done or is ready for another step depending on the recipe ; instead of just guessing. \n\n4.] Do not use shakers to salt things . Keep a little bowl of salt by your stove . Remember all salt is not created equal so you may need to play with different types . I almost always use kosher salt except for baking but thats just me . Any how salt shakers don't let you control the salt so it is easier to over indulge instead of just a pinch at at a time \n\n5.] Same goes for pepper . Unless you have a  pepper mill or grinder you already trust then this is also a safe bet . Some folks just make a blend and leave it at that and use it for just about everything . If i do that then i like to do about 75% kosher salt to about 25% black pepper . \n\n6.] Keep dry cotton hand towels handy . One draped over a shoulder or in an apron string . You never know when a mess or spill wil happen or when you may need to pull out a pan from the oven or move the hot one you forgot you sat there oven .They also are great for keeping your knife clean or giving your hand a quick dry for dealing with life stuff.\n\n7.] Do not be afraid to try your mistakes.  Messing up is part of cooking . Sometimes weird things work ..sometimes they make you question everything  you hold sacred. Either way trying them helps develop your pallete over time and will help you to understand what works together and what does not \n\n8.] If you have read this far then then the last thing i will share is HAVE FUN ! Cooking is more than just a way to fuel yourself . It can be a release and a chance to create and share so have fun with it and relax with it when you can . \n\nI hope these tips help and feel free to ask any questions!\n\nEDIT: Holy cow ! Ididnt expect all this love .

But paprika? Nothing. I added SO MUCH paprika to my eggs. Everyone says it\u2019s amazing. Nothing, except they got a bit crunchier. Basil or oregano? Nope. Thyme? It\u2019s visually pleasing, I guess. Cilantro makes my mouth itchy and smells awful, but I can actually taste that one (it\u2019s bad to me). \n\nThings like butter, citrus, vinegar, that\u2019s all fine. Red pepper flakes or cayenne have the same taste of \u201cburn\u201d (which I like, but apparently spicy things have a \u201cflavor\u201d? Spicy things have always just been Hot Flavor to me). Soy sauce has a taste but I think it\u2019s just vinegar to be honest. \n\nAt first I thought I just wasn\u2019t adding *enough*, but when I tell you I\u2019ve been drowning things in spices\u2026. And it\u2019s not even just sprinkling it on at the end\u2014 I pan fry things in spices, I follow recipes and put them on meat before cooking, mix them with my bread crumbs, add them to sauces, all sorts of things. But all I get is the salt, pepper, and general Acidy or Spicy. \n\nAnd I CAN taste things. I can taste fish and love seafood, I can enjoy different fruits and vegetables (love brussel sprouts), it\u2019s not like I am completely unable to taste things. And I can SMELL the spices and tell the difference with my nose, just not my tongue usually. I don\u2019t drink soda or anything with my meals so that isn\u2019t overpowering my mouth either. \n\nKind of wanting to go back to butter noodles with salt and vinegar.

{"title": "Egg Drop Soup is comforting and insanely simple to make.", "selftext": "Seriously. It's basically just make liquid hot, add egg, stir. The way you doctor it up is completely up to you, but here's a very foundational recipe. This makes a single serving but can be scaled 1:1.\n\n*Egg Drop Soup*\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n1 cup chicken broth (or broth of your choice)\n\n1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste\n\nA few drops of sesame oil\n\n1 teaspoon cornstarch\n\n2 teaspoons cold water\n\nPinch of salt if desired\n\nWhite pepper to taste (I don't always have this on hand and black pepper also works fine)\n\n**Method**\n\nMix together liquid ingredients in a small pot\n\nMake a slurry using the cornstarch and just a bit of cold water. To do this, whisk the cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl briskly until it combines into a thick, almost batter-like, liquid. Doing this will prevent the cornstarch from clumping up in the soup.\n\nAdd slurry to the hot broth while stirring to thicken. Now is a good time to carefully take a taste and see how much salt and pepper it needs. I like my soups salty, but having already added broth and soy sauce, this one is often salty enough already.\n\nTHE FUN PART! Beat an egg and drop that bad boy in the pot once the water comes to a low boil. Immediately turn off the heat while stirring (in one direction) as the egg will continue to cook in the residual heat. You can let it boil while stirring for a moment if you like a firmer egg, but I enjoy them whispy.\n\nEnjoy while hot! \n\n**Notes**\n\nStir either clockwise or counterclockwise, but not both. Stirring in one direction gives the eggs that whispy but fluffy texture.\n\nThe color will probably look a bit bland compared to what you are used to from takeout places. I assume they either add some coloring or maybe use a white soy sauce? I dunno, but this one is just as good.\n\nI go easy on sesame oil because I find it can easily get overpowering, but feel free to add more if you love the stuff.\n\nKeep it casual when making this. The base of it is broth, soy sauce, and egg, beyond that is your playground. This recipe is meant to be a jumping off point.

{"title": "Having trouble with seasoning your food properly? Try the apple experiment!", "selftext": "I've mentioned this a couple times before in this sub, but I figured I should make a post about it too.\n\nIf you are having trouble with your food coming up bland, or just not quite right, seasoning-wise, it is probably due to not just how much salt you're adding, but when you're adding it.\n\nTake an apple and slice it up. I like slices that are about 1/4\" thick for this\n\nUsing a very small pinch of salt, lightly sprinkle each slice of apple with the same amount of salt. But do it at different time intervals.\n\nSalt slice one and let it sit 5 minutes. \n\nSalt slice two and let it sit 4 minutes.\n\nSalt slice three and let it sit 3 minutes.\n\nSalt slice four and let it sit 1 minute.\n\nSalt slice 5 immediately before eating it.\n\nYou should notice that the longer the salt has been on the apple, the more \"appley\" the apple will taste. The 5 minute slice likely won't be \"salty\", but will taste intensely of apple. With each slice you will notice the apple tasting less \"appley\" and slightly more like an apple with salt on it. The slice you salt immediately before eating will taste a bit bland and salty.\n\nSalt helps draw flavor out of the food, and the more time you give it penetrate and work it's magic, the deeper into the food it can get. This is one of the reasons why things like brining, marinating and dry brining are done. If you combine this method with other flavorings (herbs, spices, citrus zest, vinegar, etc) the salt helps those flavors penetrate and become part of the food too.\n\nWhen you are seasoning you food keep this in mind. Adding salt to something, especially something \"wet\", like meat, potatoes, tomatoes and allowing that salt to sit on there until absorbed, will allow the salt to penetrate into that food and make the food more flavorful. For drier raw food, like green beans, broccoli, even carrots, you can achieve the same effect by blanching in salted water.\n\nIf you are only adding seasonings (salt) at the end of your cooking process, or not letting the salt absorb, your food may taste a bit bland and salty at the same time. Giving salt the time it needs to work on your food is key to getting the most flavor out of your food.\n\nWith this method you may find that even though you are salting each individual ingredient, you may end up using less salt overall, and may not need to add salt once the food is on the plate.\n\nIt's worth experimenting around with to find how much salt, and how long that salt sits on your food before cooking it, works for your taste buds", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1he5w7b/having_trouble_with_seasoning_your_food_properly/", "created_utc": 1734191977.0, "score": 859, "author": "mmmmpork", "num_comments": 78, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1he5w7b/having_trouble_with_seasoning_your_food_properly/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "For the love of Julia Child, do something with your tortillas.", "selftext": "Let's start with a story.  About a decade ago, a friend invited me over for fajita night.  He had the skirt steak marinating for 12 hours and was in the process of firing up the charcoal grill.  \"Awesome, I'll make the pico de gallo and guacamole and be right over,\" which got him excited because he had had my guacamole before.  I got there just as he was pulling the meat and it smelled wonderful.  And then, he pulled the flour tortillas out of the fridge and started assembling the tacos.  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Aren't you going to warm those tortillas up?\" I asked, and he said I could throw mine in the microwave if I wanted.  I grabbed the tortillas and tossed a few on the grill, flipping a couple of times until toasted, and told him to try one.   I swear I changed his culinary world.\n\nMy dad always said that the tortillas that we buy were only mostly cooked.  I am not sure I totally agree with that, but I do firmly believe that both corn and flour tortillas are vastly improved with a little heat treatment.  \n\nPart of that improvement comes from the fact that traditional flour tortillas are made with lard which is solid at room temperature.  Warming them up, \"melts\" the fat which makes them more pliable with a softer, moister mouth-feel.  Warming them in the microwave can accomplish this, but we can do even better.  Just as toasting can add depth to the flavor and texture of a slice of bread, so can it do the same for a tortilla.  In Mexican households, we have what is called a comal which is basically a heavy cast iron flat plate, and personally, mine never comes off the stove.  But you don't need one to do the job.  Any heavy pan big enough to hold the tortilla laying flat will do.  Pre-heat it over medium heat, toss a tortilla on it, and flip every 20-30 seconds.  As the tortilla heats, air pockets inside will expand and the parts that stay in contact with the pan will brown and get crispy.  If you have never had a flour tortilla done this way, please try it.  A good tortilla can outshine the filling when done right.  \n\nAs for corn tortillas, they are not made with any fat at all.  That is why I will always fry them in a bit of lard before eating.  If you don't keep lard in your kitchen, vegetable oil will do,  It doesn't take much fat, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, also at medium heat.  You can lightly fry them until the edges start to brown a little for a flexible tortilla or until they blister for a shell that will be crunchy once it cools.  This is a must for tostada shells.  You can even take some aluminum foil and fold it into a taco shape that will stand up on its own upside down.  When you pull the tortilla, drape it over your taco form and it will harden into that shape as it cools.  No more buying Old El Paso pre-formed taco shells.  This method also works on an upside-down bowl for mini taco salad bowls.  You could also take a few and cut into quarters, lightly fry, and then scramble with eggs for a dish my family calls Migas.  But the best thing I do with a corn tortilla is fry one side and flip, put a heaping handful of shredded Monterey Jack chees on it, and fold in half.  Fry both sides until crunchy, salt, and enjoy a quesadilla that blows the ones at your local TexMex joint out of the water.  \n\nTortillas, both flour and corn, are absolutely essential to Mexican and TexMex cuisine.  They really deserve to be treated as more than a wrapper for something delicious.  When done right, they are the something delicious.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/rryoad/for_the_love_of_julia_child_do_something_with/", "created_utc": 1640860053.0, "score": 851, "author": "withouta3", "num_comments": 101, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/rryoad/for_the_love_of_julia_child_do_something_with/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

But I've had to check my own mentality at times in my cooking journey, so I thought a reminder may be encouraging to those just getting into cooking.\n\nFood can be ugly and still be incredible. You can deviate from tradition when making something and still have a fantastic end result. You can go off the rails on recipes or make your own mad scientist type creations. Who gives a shit if it's not \"authentic\" or \"proper\" if it's good. And even if it's not good, you can learn from it and try again very soon because we have to eat or ya know, we'll die.\n\nFinally, don't do it for the 'gram unless you just enjoy food photography like me, and even if you do don't prioritize looks over taste. Yes we \"taste with our eyes\", that's a real thing, so make it pretty if you can/want. But I can assure you that some of the best dishes I've ever had look absolutely terrible when photographed. My family forcibly demands my chicken and drop-dumplings once a week and it looks like prison food.\n\nSo enjoy the nice pictures and fun videos of people cooking difficult, pretty, complex dishes. I do. But don't let the arms race of cooking media ever discourage you from getting into the kitchen, having fun, and sustaining yourself. I'm about to take another shot at recreating an exact replica of Taco Bell's chicken flatbread because damn it I miss that menu item and I don't care who judges me.\n\nAnd since I need a flair, here's a recipe for Raising Cane's sauce in hopes that I can cut down on the ridiculous traffic from people lining up into the street to get mediocre fried chicken on my town's main thoroughfare. Yeah I know I'm being a hypocrite, but come on, Zaxby's is right down the street and it's way better.\n\nCombine 2 parts mayo to 1 part Ketchup and add a bit of mustard. I prefer horseradish or dijon mustard but yellow works fine and gets a better color. I don't know if they actually use mustard, but I find that adding a small squeeze of it adds a lot to the sauce. Mix in a splash of worchestershire sauce along with pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Taste it and adjust to your taste. Adding a bit of salt is probably going to be necessary, but I like to do that last since the worchestershire sauce can bring a lot of sodium to the party. Personally, I like mine quite peppery.  Dip some buttered garlic toast in it and you have the best part of Cane's without having to go sit in the middle of the road holding everyone up to pay too much money for it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kgwh30/your_food_doesnt_have_to_be_traditional_optimized/", "created_utc": 1608480195.0, "score": 816, "author": "southerngentleman90", "num_comments": 77, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kgwh30/your_food_doesnt_have_to_be_traditional_optimized/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

A touch tangy. Full of umami. And oh so delicious. It will give you the ability to add big flavor to a dish with little effort.\u2800\n\nBut that\u2019s not a guarantee. If you\u2019re adding tomato paste straight to the liquid, you're missing out on flavor! \n\nSo here\u2019s the trick. Always brown your tomato paste. Whether you cook it on its own or add it to a pan full of onions, celery, and carrots, give the paste and the fat-filled pan plenty of 1-on-1 time. You want to caramelize the tomato paste until it turns a deep red color. \u2800\n\nIf you\u2019re cooking aromatic vegetables for the base of a sauce or soup, wait until they are almost done. And then add your tomato paste. Crank the heat up slightly and stir frequently so it doesn\u2019t burn. You want to suck all the brightness out of it!\u2800\n\nOnce it\u2019s turned maroon, make sure to deglaze the pan with wine, stock, or even water. You\u2019ll pick up all the flavor stuck on the bottom of the pan from the browned paste. #SaveTheFond\n\nDon\u2019t use tomato paste?

{"title": "How to Make Chicken Breasts Not Suck: A Complete Guide for Beginners", "selftext": "Dry. Chalky. Rubbery. Spongey. Crunchy. Bland. Tasteless. These are all common adjectives used to describe chicken breasts. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Chicken breasts can be juicy, delicate, and full of flavor, and I\u2019m going to help you achieve that. \n\nThere are just four things you need to know, so this serves as the **TL;DR** for this very long post:\n\n1. Buy air-chilled\n\n2. Make cutlets\n\n3. Salt properly\n\n  a. Light flour coating\n\n4. Cook to the correct temperature\n\nAnd if you are so inclined, I will cover each of these in great detail below. \n\n## 1. Air-chilled\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the saying \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d, right? Keep that in mind as I explain this. \n\nIn the US, more than 95% of chickens are processed using a liquid-cooled solution^[1](https://www.bellandevans.com/healthy-living/chlorinated-chicken-concerns-europe-overreacting/). This means they are submerged in ice-cold chlorinated water, and after this, some are then injected with a salt water brine solution, sometimes referred to as broth. As a result of this process, the chicken retains some of that water. It is easy to identify this if you read the fine print on the packaging. See examples below:\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 1%](https://i.imgur.com/gBSVam6.jpg)\n\n[Tyson brand, up to 3%](https://i.imgur.com/Vj333Dw.jpg)\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 10%](https://i.imgur.com/eRMgQr7.jpg)\n\n[Walmart brand, up to ***15%!!***](https://i.imgur.com/IBhQILK.png)\n\n\nFrozen chicken breasts are most often the ones that are also injected (sometimes called enhanced) with a salt water brine, and usually contain up to 15% retained water^[1](https://i.imgur.com/itbyASa.png) ^[2](https://i.imgur.com/eZS9RaD.jpg)\n\nSo why does this matter? Put simply, it is diluting the chicken flavor and changing the texture. Also, the weight of the chicken you are buying is calculated after it is injected or cooled in a bath. That means you are paying chicken prices for this added salt water.\n\nAir-chilled chicken is just as it sounds. Instead of submerging the chicken in ice-cold chlorinated water, these chickens are essentially chilled in a massive refrigerator. This is actually more expensive for the manufacturers, so that translates to higher prices for consumers. At my local grocery store, air chilled chicken breasts are over 3x the cost of standard chicken breasts ($1.99/lb vs $6.69/lb). Whether or not that is worth it is up to you, but I can tell you that I will never go back to the cheap breasts again. Again, just check the labels. Anything that is air-chilled will be labeled as such. See [here](https://i.imgur.com/AgzIUgl.jpg), [here](https://i.imgur.com/0OT2Z5Z.png), and [here](https://i.imgur.com/p4PoL8u.jpg). \n\nWhat about organic chicken? Well, not all organic chicken is air-chilled, and not all air-chilled chicken is organic. I personally do not think *organic* air-chilled chicken is worth the extra cost (around $10/lb near me), it does not taste any better than non-organic *air-chilled* chicken, in my experience. Keep in mind that any company that is producing air-chilled chicken is likely more concerned about producing a quality product than a company that is using liquid cooling. \n\n## 2. Cutlets \nPart of the challenge when cooking chicken breast is having a tapered piece of meat that will always cook unevenly. This will result in the thin side being completely overdone when the thickest side is perfect. Or if the thin side is perfect, the thickest side is still raw. So the only way to combat this is to make the entire piece the same thickness. [Enter the cutlet](https://i.imgur.com/egyDjGE.jpg). \n\nYou will absolutely need a very sharp knife for this, but since that is arguably the #1 most important tool in the kitchen, it\u2019s safe for me to assume that you already have one of those, right? I like to use a boning knife for this, but a chef\u2019s knife will work. \n\nIf your chicken breasts have the tenderloin still attached, you will want to cut that off and cook it separately because it will create an air pocket, and sometimes things will not cook properly if it is still attached. [See here](https://youtu.be/2BeQftjYNO4?t=21). Just think of it as a bonus for the cook.\n\nNow this next step is sort of optional, but if you are working with very large breasts (around 7-9 ounces each), then I consider it mandatory. Use your very sharp knife that you most definitely already have, and slice that chicken breast in half *horizontally*. [See here](https://youtu.be/MrVIHL7JkTM?t=126). Alternatively, you can cut them in half *vertically* first, and then slice the thicker end in half horizontally. This will create smaller portions, if you would like, and it will be a bit easier to cut them horizontally. [See here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=23).\n\nNow that you have your portions ready, you need to ensure they are all an even thickness by *gently* pounding them to about \u00bc\u201d-\u00bd\u201d thickness. Emphasis on gently because it is very possible to explode your chicken breasts. Lay some plastic wrap over the chicken cutlets and use a meat pounder or mallet on the thickest parts of the cutlets. The key is to create an even thickness, it doesn\u2019t really matter how thick they actually are. You will see this process in the video I linked to above. If you do not have a meat pounder or mallet, you can use a small pot. \n\n## 3. Salt \nThis should be a very deliberate thing. Salt and savory cooking are a package deal. There should never be a time where you forget salt, because it should just be second nature to add salt to things that you want to taste good. Bland and lacking salt are synonymous. \nWhen it comes to cooking chicken (and meat in general), it should be even more deliberate. Salt not only enhances the flavor of our food, but in the case of chicken breast, it actually helps to retain much of the liquid that is lost during the cooking process, and creates more tender cooked chicken. [Here](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/the-food-lab-the-truth-about-brining-turkey-thanksgiving.html) is a very thorough write-up if you want to read more about it. \n\nOn top of retaining more liquid, it obviously adds flavor, but it\u2019s very easy to add too much, or too little. We\u2019ve all heard that we should \u201csalt to taste\u201d, but there are some things where this doesn\u2019t work very well, like salting your raw chicken breast before cooking it. Fortunately, the good folks at [Cook\u2019s Illustrated have this figured out for us](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5681-salting-meat) (the formatting of that page seems to be broken currently). I can personally attest that the amount of salt listed in the aforementioned article is perfect, for my and my family\u2019s tastes, you may want a bit more or a bit less. \u00be teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pound of boneless poultry is what they suggest. The brand of salt is also very important. If you aren\u2019t already aware, 1 teaspoon table salt = 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton kosher salt = 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt^[1](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5799-salt-types-and-measurements)\n\nSo let\u2019s look at a realistic example: Say you bought a package of fresh air-chilled chicken breast and the total weight listed on the package is 1.67 pounds. How much salt do you add? ***Edit: this part is not true!*** ~~Well, for starters, that weight is for the entire package of chicken, not just the meat you are going to be eating. Surprise! That\u2019s right, grocery stores weigh the entire package when printing their labels, so you are paying for the packaging as well.~~ So if you start with a package that is 1.67 pounds, you can safely round down to 1.5 pounds, so that means 1.5 teaspoons of Diamond Crystal brand kosher salt, or \u00be teaspoon of any fine table salt. \n\n*When* you add the salt is also very important. Unlike spices and herbs, salt actually penetrates fully throughout the meat, and it does so at a rate that increases as the temperature increases. \n\nAssuming you have cutlets and pounded them thin, next you will want to sprinkle on the appropriate amount of salt, let it sit on a plate or baking sheet at room temp while you continue prepping the rest of your meal. Since this should be your first step, your chicken will only be sitting out for about 30 minutes at room temp, so it is perfectly safe. \n\nBecause salt is hygroscopic, it will begin to draw the moisture out of the chicken, which will in turn dissolve the salt, and then most of that salt water will be reabsorbed back into the chicken. You can actually watch this process happen if you take a close look at your salted chicken every 5 minutes or so. \n\nAt this point, feel free to take whatever creative measures you wish with any other spices or herbs. But the point should remain that salt is the #1 concern at this stage. In fact, a properly salted chicken breast will taste good without the addition of any other spices or herbs. I would even suggest that you try this first so that you can establish a baseline for what good chicken should taste like.\n\nNext, before cooking, there is one final semi-optional step. I say semi-optional because I think the only exception for skipping this is if you have Celiac disease or are counting calories. \n\n### 3a. Flour\n\nCoating your cutlets in a very light layer of flour will protect the outer surface of the chicken from the high heat and it prevents the edges of the chicken from becoming too dry. It really does wonders for the final product. You can see this process in one of the previous videos I linked to, [here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=111). You only need a couple tablespoons of flour per breast, this is not fried chicken. Even if you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, I\u2019m sure you could simply use alternative flours for this. \n\n## 4. Cook\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we talk about temperature first. I think the #1 concern for most people about cooking chicken is that you ensure it is cooked thoroughly, as to kill off any salmonella that may be present. The FDA/USDA tells us that we should cook our chicken to 165F because that is the temperature that salmonella (and most other bad bacteria) are killed instantly at, and this just simplifies everything so that there is only one standard to remember, and it is safe for all types of immune systems. What they are not telling you is that bacteria (including salmonella) can be killed off by both temperature *and* time. This is how we pasteurize dairy products without cooking them. You hold them at very specific temperatures for very specific amounts of time. \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about temperatures. Remember, 165F is the temp at which bacteria are killed *instantly*. Unfortunately, your chicken is damn near overcooked at this point. You can safely cook your chicken to 150F as long as it maintains a minimum of 150F for just 3 minutes. [This source](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/07/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-chicken-breast.html) has a very clear time and temperature chart for a reference, and all data comes from the same people that told you to cook to 165F. So once your chicken reaches a minimum of 150F in the thickest part (since you\u2019ve presumably made evenly sized cutlets, there should be no drastically different \u201cthickest part\u201d), you want to pull it from the hot pan and let it sit on a plate (ideally a warmed plate) for at least 5 minutes. Remember to check the temperature in several different spots of the chicken so you can be sure. During the resting time, the temperature will actually rise a bit, thanks to carry over cooking, by about 2-5 degrees or so. Thicker cuts rise more, thinner cuts rise less. If it actually reaches 155F, then everything bad will have been killed off in less than 48 seconds. \n\nI will add a disclaimer here to say that if you are cooking for any children, elderly, pregnant women, or otherwise immunocompromised, cooking to 165F is always the safest option. \n\nSo if you haven\u2019t figured this out yet, you will absolutely need a digital instant read thermometer. This isn\u2019t something you can or should guess at. The thermometer is mandatory, it\u2019s as simple as that. I can provide some good recommendations for different budgets if you would like.  \n\nI will always opt for pan frying in this case. I do not think baking thinly sliced chicken breasts with a light coating of flour will work well. In fact, this entire post is basically to discourage people from trying to bake their oversized chicken breasts in the oven. It\u2019s just not a good method, for many reasons. We really need the high heat and direct contact of a skillet to achieve some browning. Browning things creates new flavors, it is important, and it should be something you are deliberately trying to achieve. \n\nI prefer a stainless steel pan for this, but cast iron will work as well. You want to pre-heat your pan over med-high heat with at least 2 tablespoons of oil in it. You will need slightly more oil than you would normally use, as the light coating of flour will soak up a good amount of the oil. Once that oil begins to shimmer and then you see the first wisps of smoke, it is time to add the chicken. \n\nWe are using a hard and fast cooking style. Since these cutlets are so thin, they will cook very quickly, so we want to achieve a deeply browned exterior before overcooking the middle, which is only possible over fairly high heat. \n\nSlowly lay down each cutlet into the hot oil so that you are moving your hand away from you, as to avoid any hot oil splashes. You should hear a hard sizzle almost immediately, this is a good sign. Most 12\u201d skillets should be able to easily fit 3 cutlets at one time, maybe 4 depending on the size of chicken. This is also a good time to use a splatter screen, if you have one. \n\nAfter adding the chicken, you may want to turn the heat up to high, but be ready to turn it back down again if things get too dark, too quickly. Let the chicken cook undisturbed until the edges of the chicken begin to turn white. Then it\u2019s time to start peaking at the bottom. It\u2019s probably a good idea to rotate each cutlet 180 degrees so that they brown more evenly. You probably have some hotspots in your pan. Once each cutlet achieves a deeply browned surface on the one side, then flip it. If you notice the pan is rather dry when you flip it, add more oil to the spot that is dry. Now keep cooking the second side until you reach a minimum 150F internal temp. You should be more concerned about this temperature than you are about browning on the second side. Now pull each cutlet and transfer them to a warmed plate to rest for 5 minutes. \n\n## Bonus - Pan Sauces\nSo now that you have your pan-fried chicken cutlets resting, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to make a pan sauce. In fact, this cooking method is worth doing just for this opportunity alone. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t use a nonstick skillet, you should now see a lot of [built up brown bits](https://i.imgur.com/M45PnAv.jpg), called fond, on the bottom of your pan. If you did use a nonstick skillet, well, then no fond for you! If the fond looks black and burnt, your heat was too high for too long, and you should skip this step. \nPut your pan back on the heat, medium heat is fine. Get your fond hot, and before it starts to darken, you need to add liquid. You can simply add water, but chicken stock is a better option. If you have it, some white wine along with the water or stock is also a great idea. How much? It doesn\u2019t really matter. Maybe enough so that it\u2019s at least \u215b\u201d deep. Now, bring it to a simmer, and use a flat wooden spoon and start scraping all of that fond up until the bottom of the pan is completely clean. Once you\u2019ve achieved that, let it simmer until it\u2019s reduced slightly. The residual flour in the pan should help thicken the sauce ever so slightly. It\u2019s easy to over reduce at this point, since you are using a wide and shallow pan, so take it off the heat as soon as it\u2019s where you want it. \n\nAt this point, you just need to stir in 1-2 tablespoons of butter and then give it a taste. Add salt until it tastes good. That\u2019s about as simple as you can go, or you can do any of the following to make it even better\n\n* Before adding the liquid, add 1 tablespoon of flour to the fond and cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, or until the flour begins to toast. This will add more flavor and more body to the pan sauce.\n\n* Along with the flour, add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, and cook until the tomato paste turns rust colored. This adds even more flavor. \n\n* To your cold water or boxed stock, sprinkle on a packet of unflavored gelatin and allow it to bloom for a couple minutes before adding to the hot pan. This adds more body to your pan sauce. You don\u2019t need to do this if you are using homemade stock. \n\n* Before adding the liquid, add some minced shallots and a bit of oil to the hot pan and cook for a couple minutes.\n\n* After adding the butter, whisk in some fresh lemon juice and capers or dijon mustard. The addition of acid is almost always a good idea. \n\n---\n\nLastly, a message to all of the chicken thigh cult members out there, because I know that you are a passionate bunch.

{"title": "Flatbread doesn't have to be complicated, and you probably have what you need to make it.", "selftext": "In fact, all you really need to make a basic flatbread is flour, water, and salt. Even the salt isn't necessary really. Hell, you don't even need a bowl or a spoon. You can make a pile of flour on your counter (cleaned counter I hope), make a little well in the center, and slowly mix in water with your hands until it forms a dough. Then squish it and toss it on a hot surface and you've got a basic flatbread that could be made on a rock in the woods with no tools other than the means to make fire.\n\nNow that we've gone to the extreme end of simplification and removed the mystery of making probably the world's oldest bread product, I'll go into a leavened version that is only a tiny bit more complex, but will yield fluffy, chewy flatbreads with those characteristic air pockets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: These amounts are mostly a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Think of it as a starting point, in no time you won't even need to get near a measuring cup to make it.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n1 1/2-2 teaspoons baking powder\n\nA pinch of salt\n\n3/4 cup of water\n\n1 tablespoon of oil\n\n**Instructions**\n\nIf you want to get fancy, use a bowl. For the record though, you can absolutely make this using the pile of flour method if you want. That counter's gonna get flour on it anyway so why not.\n\nMix together flour, baking powder, and salt. If you'd like to flavor it up with other seasonings (garlic powder for example) add it now.\n\nAdd the water a small amount at a time and begin mixing together by hand, or with a spoon, or a stick or something.\n\nOnce a rough dough begins to form, add the olive oil and mix by hand until a cohesive ball has formed. Add flour/liquid if needed during this process. We want dough that is pliable, but not too sticky.\n\nDust the counter (for the love of god make sure it's clean first) with flour and plop that dough boy on there. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it slowly springs back when you poke it.\n\nNow we will portion it into balls somewhere between golf ball and baseball sized. A bench scraper is ideal for this, but I use an old, dull knife to separate into chunks.\n\nMake the dough flat. My favorite way to do this is by gently pressing it out with my fingertips until it is about 1/4 inch thick, occasionally picking it up by the edges to stretch it out. I find that by hand-working the dough, we preserve more of the gluten structure formed from the kneading process. You can also roll it out with a rolling pin, can of beans, beer bottle, whatever. It'll still be very good, just make sure it's flat.\n\nHeat a skillet to medium-high, using a bit of cooking spray if you feel it may get sticky (totally optional). Slap a flat-dough on there and watch it bubble up for a minute or two. Once the underside has gotten nice and browned and it's puffed up a bit, gently flip and cook for another minute or two, until the bubbles on the bottom have browned up. After flipping I like to mush it down very gently with the spatula to slightly even out the browning, but honestly I mostly do that cause it's fun.\n\nAs flatbreads finish cooking, place them in a stack on a plate and cover them with a towel. The residual heat will slightly steam them, making them soft and pliable.\n\nEnjoy with wraps, curry, or topped with softened butter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add the cost breakdown (sorry for the crappy formatting, I couldn't sleep so I just threw this together to illustrate how cheap it is:\n\n \n\nFlour: 10lb for 2.24   -   $0.45\n\nOlive Oil: 93 tbsp for 15.88   -   $0.17 for recipe\n\nWater: 24 pack for 9.94   -  $0.45  for recipe (with some left over to drink) \n\nKosher salt: 3 pounds for 16.99 (Diamond Crystal)   -  $0.02 for recipe\n\nBaking powder: 22 oz for 5.28   -   $0.02 for recipe\n\nTotal cost for 4 flatbreads: $1.11\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuys and gals, that's a buck for a pile of flatbread and a lot of experience working with dough. Plus, as you can see, I was even being extravagant on the price by using bottled water and a mid-priced bottle of olive oil. I don't actually even cook with bottled water and you can use oil that is cheaper to still get great results. Realistically if you're using tap water, I see the cost of this being more like 75 cents.\n\nSo there it is if you needed more incentive. About a dollar (probably less) and you can get more familiar with making bread, plus the end result is fresh flatbread for 2-3 people.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jfzw47/flatbread_doesnt_have_to_be_complicated_and_you/", "created_utc": 1603374286.0, "score": 718, "author": "southerngentleman90", "num_comments": 51, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jfzw47/flatbread_doesnt_have_to_be_complicated_and_you/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "One BIG REASON You Should Learn To Cook People Are All Of A Sudden Scared To Talk About", "selftext": "Maybe because it conjures up images of a sleazy French man cooking for a naive American girl or people are obsessed with gender roles in society and that women should no longer be expected to sign up for a lifetime of prepping meals for their husbands (I don't think they should for the record) but it is time to address cooking as a serious dating tool.\n\nI'm not talking about men or women, or trying to get laid.  I'm talking about your actual value as a human being for another human being.\n\nSomewhere between money, lifestyle and status people forget that relationships are built in the trenches.  You often fall in love with someone because they make you chicken soup when you're sick or prepare a decent rigatoni the first time they meet your parents or your friends can't believe they woke up early to make everyone crepes on a hungover Sunday.\n\nThe ability to cook is a serious attribute. Much like the ability to make someone laugh is a serious attribute. Much like showing up on time and being reliable when sh\\*t hits the fan is a serious attribute.\n\nSo why learn to cook? I mean, really put time and effort into learning how to cook?\n\nBecause then you can host and hosting will open more social doors for you than you'll ever imagine.  You can be mediocre by all accounts and you obliterate loneliness by simply saying \"Hey I'm making a big dinner tonight come by and bring your friends\" (people rarely turn down a free meal especially in their 20's).\n\nAll I'm trying to say is learning to cook for yourself is motivation but you'll be surprised how much more motivating it is to learn to cook so you can make other people happy.\n\nIn 2023, between between Door Dash and and the Chipotle-fication of restaurants you don't NEED to know how to cook like you did out of necessity in 1965.  Which is why it has become a scarce resource and scarce resources are always valuable.\n\nPS: Please share your thoughts and stories!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/10v9rk3/one_big_reason_you_should_learn_to_cook_people/", "created_utc": 1675698258.0, "score": 718, "author": "ReggieMilligan", "num_comments": 182, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/10v9rk3/one_big_reason_you_should_learn_to_cook_people/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Tips that have helped my cooking", "selftext": "Hi everyone!  About 6 years ago I was a hopeless cook. I'd eat pasta or noodles every meal and it would always be bland and boring. Since then I've worked hard to try and become a better chef and I wanted to share some general tips that have helped me cook better. \n\nPrep: \nAlways prep before you start. There's no better way to guarantee your meal will be burnt than trying to chop the potatoes while your onion fries. Have everything chopped/grated/out of the pantry before you switch the heat on. Also clear your work space, it helps you track what's going into the pan and when. Switch on the oven and let it preheat if you need it. \n\n\nHerbs: \nFresh is best. If you use dried it usually for baking and even then don't over use as they can be bitter. \n\nRosemary, oregano and thyme are good baking herbs. Use them when you intend to bake something in the oven and they'll add great flavour and aromatics. They tend to pair well with meat or starchy veg.\n\nParsley and Coriander are softer herbs and won't stand up to baking. Instead add them towards the end of cooking to get their full flavour. \n\nBasil is definitely an aromatic. That means it tastes bad on its own but the smell is what adds to your cooking. It should be added right at the end of cooking when the heat is off!\n\n\nSpices:\nFirstly make sure you have all the staples. I'd include cumin, coriander seeds, turmeric, paprika, nutmeg, ginger, sumac and chili flakes as my go to spices. Buy the big bags from Asian groceries to keep the price down and refill glass jars. \n\nMake sure you add spices early either as a marinade with oil on your meat/veg or at the very least before you add any liquid to your dish. \n\nUse recipes as inspiration for what combos of spices and herbs go well together. \n\nCumin is my favourite spice. This is because I find it so versatile and can be found in many of the cuisines I cook. For example you can pair it with paprika if your making fajitas, or with turmeric in a curry. Add it to some mince alone and make a kebab. \n\nChilli flakes are the one spice worth spending a little more on. Cheap flakes or chili powder add a hot but nasty shallow taste to your food. Instead go for aleppo or Urfa chili flakes if you can find them, your food will instantly be richer. \n\nSumac is good with red meat, add it after cooking and it will add a nice lemony taste that'll make your dish more interesting. \n\nOther ingredients:\nSalt - Add early especially to meat. I usually sprinkle before I even start cooking. If your adding liquid make sure you taste and sprinkle again if needed. \n\nGarlic - Garlic is getting is the king of aromatics and flavour. I use it in most meals. Frequently I add it early to the pan and fry on a low heat to keep it from burning (depending on the meal I can do this for up to 5 mins!) . Then whack up the heat just before you cook whatever else you have. \n\nFlour - Defintely can be your friend when cooking meat. A sprinkling (maybe half a handful) of flour added before cooking will help your meat pick up flavour from galric/spices and make it richer. It can also be used when thickening a sauce, but it can't work miracles, just carefully pour away excess liquid. \n\nButter/salt/sugar - If you're not worried about your health just put a lot of these ingredients in. Tbh you can't go wrong on quantities (within reason!) and they will improve just about any dish. I add salt and sugar early and then butter towards the end as it can make a dish richer. \n\nEquipment:\nKnives- Tip I learnt from Anthony Bourdain. A few quality pieces of cookware are much better than cupboards of tat.  Just have one good chopping knife. It should be large and kept very sharp. Make sure you buy a proper knife sharpener to go with it.\n\nPans- I mostly use one large frying pan which has high sides and is oven proof. Most of my dishes are made on the stove top but I've learnt that I can confidently put it in the oven too. I primarily do this when I want to fry meat to get that nice seared taste but then want to bake the dish to get a richer flavour in the liquid. \n\n\nHope these tips help, I'm sure there is more I have forgotten ill add later. \n\nI'll try to answer any follow up questions when I get the chance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/fy11rh/tips_that_have_helped_my_cooking/", "created_utc": 1586467631.0, "score": 657, "author": "penurious", "num_comments": 43, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/fy11rh/tips_that_have_helped_my_cooking/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I'll never buy boxed macaroni and cheese again.", "selftext": "This works with any kind of pasta - fusilli, penne, macaroni, angel hair, spaghetti, whatever. You can buy it in bulk, store brand, for pretty good prices, especially when it's on sale. Stock up if it goes on sale.\n\nThen you want deli American cheese, not the prepackaged stuff. Yes it matters, because yes it's different. (And better!)\n\nSalt the water and boil the pasta according to directions. I like mine on the firmer side so when the box says \"cooks in 10-12 minutes\" I pull it at 9-10 minutes. If it says 5-6 minutes (like angel hair) I pull it at 4 minutes or so, if the noodles are really pliable when I stir them. (Side note, most directions vastly overstate the amount of water you need. In general you want the pasta completely covered with at least an inch of water on top of it. You don't have to wait the 20 minutes it takes to boil four quarts of water for a box of spaghetti noodles. Use a large sauce pan and break them in half and then apply gentle pressure until they soften and are submerged, for example.)\n\nDrain into a colander but don't do a good job of it - you want some of that salted water in reserve, probably 2-3 tablespoons per serving you're cooking. Alternately you can just ladel some into a cup or bowl right before you strain the noodles. \n\nPut the noodles back in the pot with the water you saved (or that you didn't pour out) and and add 2-3 slices of cheese per serving, ripped into quarters or halves, and then stir until it's all melted and you have a cheese sauce. This takes approximately a minute or so, if you do it immediately. The residual heat on the noodles and the water you saved (immediately prior to straining) is enough to get the job done. It's that fast.\n\nThis doesn't sound like it would be good but it is phenomenal. You can also add grated parmesan or some other cheese if you want to fancy it up, but be aware that many 'harder' cheeses will not melt and emulsify well. Also shaker can parmesan (and anything pre-shredded in a bag) is treated with corn starch, which isn't really a problem for me but might be for some of you. (You want an emulsifier like sodium citrate or even good old mustard powder for some cheese, experiment if you want, and if you're really going all out you want to do this separately in a little sauce pan.)\n\nIf you use less water you can add a splash of milk, but it's not required.\n\nAdd salt and pepper, garlic, oregano or basil if you want. I sometimes add in a spoonful of basil pesto for a completely different experience.\n\nYou can get American cheese from the deli for $4-$6 per pound in most markets I'd imagine, or $8-$9 per pound for Boar's Head. I've never really counted slices but this is enough cheese for a good number of batches. It's a little more expensive than the prepackaged stuff but that's because it's actual cheese and not 'cheese product'. It's worth it. You can also use it on sandwiches and melts.\n\nIf no one watches you make this, they'll have no idea what you did and will assume you are a wizard when you say you didn't make it from a box, when in fact you got the idea from the cookingforbeginners subreddit.\n\nAdd peas and tuna for homemade tuna helper. Add steamed broccoli for noodles and broccoli in cheese sauce.

{"title": "You can make Chicken and Dumplings from scratch much more easily than you think and it's very cheap!", "selftext": " \n\n**\"Rustic\" Chicken and Dumplings**\n\nThis comforting and hearty recipe may be the epitome of cooking with what you've got. I've always gone with my eyes and by feel/taste, so take my measurements with a very hefty grain of salt. At the end of the day we are making thick chicken soup and dropping biscuit dough in. Feel free to mix it up however you want using this foundation\n\n**Ingredients for the chicken part**\n\n4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (just trust me, okay)\n\n1 medium onion, yellow or white\n\n3 or 4 cloves of garlic, minced\n\nA few tablespoons of oil or butter\n\n4 cups of chicken stock, or enough to cover at least half of the chicken thighs (I use bullion and water)\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nAromatics of choice if desired/available\n\n**Ingredients for the dumplings**\n\n2 cups AP flour\n\n2 to 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in general you want about 1 teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour)\n\n1 teaspoon white sugar\n\nPinch of salt to taste\n\n1/2 cup chilled butter (make sure it's cold)\n\n1 1/4 cups whole milk (also make sure it's cold)\n\n**Method**\n\nHeat a large pot over medium heat and add oil/butter to coat the bottom. Rub chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and place skin side down into the pot.\n\nWhile the chicken is browning, dice the onion roughly and mince the garlic.\n\nOnce the chicken thighs have gotten some color on the skin, flip them and add the onions. Let cook until the onions begin to soften.\n\nAfter onions have softened, add minced garlic. Be sure to keep the garlic moving and be ready to take off the heat if it begins to burn at all.\n\nAfter a few minutes the garlic should be a golden brown and the onion should be lightly caramelized. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add the chicken stock (aim for the chicken to be at least halfway covered and seasonings of choice. Salt and pepper will be just fine, but if you want to add aromatics or other seasonings go for it. I basically never make it the same way twice. I suggest going a bit easy for now since ideally we want that chicken fully cooked before taste testing. We can always add more later.\n\nCover the pot and let simmer until the chicken begins to fall apart, at least 30 minutes.\n\nTo make the dumplings\n\nBegin this process once the chicken is starting to get fully cooked and tender.\n\nMix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt thoroughly in a medium bowl. I like to add a bit of garlic powder as well but that's optional. Cut cold butter into small chunks and incorporate into the dry mixture. Use a fork, your hands, a stick, whatever. We just want small solid pieces of butter, roughly pea-sized.\n\nMix with utensil of choice until it forms into a very wet, shaggy dough. It will be sticky and almost more of a very thick batter when ready.\n\n**To finish it up**\n\nBy this point, the chicken should be falling off the bone and shredding easily in the pot. Pull those bones out with tongs or really anything that's not your hand. Give the chicken a rustling to get it nice and broken up, and it's time to drop those dumplings!\n\nUsing a spoon or your hands, pull out small chunks of the dough/batter and drop them into the soup. It will be a bit sticky and messy, and it won't be a pageant winner visually. Once again I am asking you to trust me. Stay conservative on scooping the dumplings as they will at least double in size, typically more. A tablespoon or so per dumpling serves me well.\n\nCook uncovered for about 10 minutes, then cover and cook for about another 10 minutes, or until the dumplings have firmed up and doubled.\n\n**EAT IT**\n\nWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! No need to let this rest. Go ahead and serve it up and eat it hot. If you are unsure of the doneness of the dumplings, pull one out and have a chef snack. It should be pillowy soft with just a bit of chew. Cooking for longer produces a chewier dumpling if that's what you prefer.\n\n**Notes**\n\nI know bone-in, skin-on thighs may raise some eyebrows. In my experience, it adds a ton of flavor and texture to the dish overall. Plus they are super cheap compared to other cuts. The skin is easy to take out after it's imparted it's delicious fatty flavor, if you prefer. Other cuts of chicken would also be fine if you'd like to go leaner, or if you only have a different cut on hand. If using white meat, be gentler on the heat and time.\n\nThe dumplings almost always end up being the star of the show, which is why I use drop dumplings instead of a more doughy dumpling. They are like pillowy flavor sponges and they thicken the broth on their own. If you prefer a thicker/chewier dumpling, add a bit more flour to the dough and/or cook a bit longer with the dumplings in.\n\nThis is a very simple base recipe, so feel free to go wild with add-ons. Throw in some peas and carrots, or add some sage or oregano.\n\nThis recipe is insanely cheap and keeps and heats up well, so no wonder it's been a go-to for feeding the family for so long. I've gotten it well below $0.75 per serving, and even with chicken breast it doesn't creep too far above a buck a bowl. Plus clean-up is minimal since we basically just use one pot and one bowl.\n\n**BONUS RECIPE**\n\nThe dumpling recipe can be used exactly as is for drop biscuits so this recipe serves double duty. Whip up some dumplings, drop roughly golf ball sized balls onto a greased pan, and bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Top with melted butter, syrup, jam, or whatever you want.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jcvq1m/you_can_make_chicken_and_dumplings_from_scratch/", "created_utc": 1602943683.0, "score": 585, "author": "southerngentleman90", "num_comments": 66, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jcvq1m/you_can_make_chicken_and_dumplings_from_scratch/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019ve even had food poisonings because I didn\u2019t know how to cook properly. I didn\u2019t know that beans need soaking and ate them almost raw. Also most of the meat I\u2019ve cooked was raw inside and that gave me food poisonings as well.\n\nThe foods I cook using YouTube or internet tutorial never work.

{"title": "This is for those who are looking for a way to cook steaks without smoking out their entire kitchen.", "selftext": "America's Test Kitchen just created a new method (new to me at least) for achieving a good sear on a steak without creating a ton of smoke. [Here is a link to the video](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/12368-pan-seared-strip-steaks), but it is behind a paywall, so I will describe the process below. \n\nYou will need a well-marbled steak that is 1 & 1/2\" thick and a nonstick skillet. \n\nYes, a nonstick skillet. I was skeptical at first, but then I tried it and was quite surprised. \n\nSeason your steaks with salt & pepper, let them sit at room temp for at least 45 minutes, or up to 24 hours in the fridge. \n\nPat the steaks dry, add to the COLD nonstick pan. That's right, cold pan, and no oil. Insanity, I know. \n\nNow, turn the burner on full blast, set a timer for 2 minutes. Once the time is up, flip the steaks and reset the timer for 2 minutes. The steaks will be gray at this point. \n\nOnce that timer is up, flip the steaks and lower the heat to medium, and reset the timer to 2 minutes. You should now see the slightest bit of browning. \n\nNow you are going to leave the heat on medium for the rest of the process. Flip every 2 minutes, you should see a dark crust forming more and more with each flip. Start checking the internal temp when the crust starts looking good. By the time it reaches 120-130F, you should have a nice crust. You will start getting some smoke at this point, due to the rendered fat, but it won't be nearly as much as more traditional methods.\n\nLet them rest for 5-10 minutes. \n\nThis actually works. I suppose you could do this in a carbon steel or cast iron as well, but I don't think stainless steel would work well here, it would probably stick initially until that crust is built up. \n\nI am not saying this is superior to a hot sear, butter baste, or reverse sear, or anything like that, I'm just saying it works, and creates barely any smoke.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/lieryw/this_is_for_those_who_are_looking_for_a_way_to/", "created_utc": 1613147907.0, "score": 583, "author": "96dpi", "num_comments": 44, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/lieryw/this_is_for_those_who_are_looking_for_a_way_to/", "html_title": ""}

However, sometimes I don't have lard on hand or easily available and let's be honest, I'm also very lazy. You can absolutely make this with sautee'd onions and garlic. You can for sure fry up the carnitas for a little extra texture. But you don't have to in order to have fall-apart, delicious pork. And if someone bullies you for using a basic recipe, let me know and I'll give them a stern talking-to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlow Cooker Carnitas\n\nIngredients:\n\n\\- 3-5 Pounds pork shoulder, cut into a few chunks\n\n\\- 3 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil\n\n\\- 6-8 ounces Mexican Coke (the kind you drink)\\*\n\n\\- 2 tablespoons citrus juice (orange, lime, or lemon)\n\n\\- 2 teaspoons garlic powder (or 6 cloves of crushed fresh garlic)\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground Cumin\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons Chile Powder\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons Onion Powder\n\n\\- 1 teaspoon dried Oregano\n\n\\- 4 teaspoons salt\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper\n\n\t\\*Be sure it's the kind with Cane Sugar, not Corn Syrup. If needed, sub in broth\n\nInstructions:\n\n\\- Divide pork shoulder into chunks so that it can fit into your slow cooker or pot.\n\n\\- Coat the bottom of the pot with oil and toss in the pork shoulder. Spread remaining oil over the meat to coat evenly. Generously add seasonings, mixing and rubbing as you go, until all of the meat is covered.\n\n\\- Mix in the citrus and Mexican Coke (or broth). The meat should be about halfway covered.\n\n\\- Cook on low for about 6 hours, or high for about 3 hours until the pork easily shreds.\n\n\\- Enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\\- This is the lazy version. If you feel sassy and want to take them up a notch, roast the pork (before slow cooking) at 450f in a high-rimmed baking sheet (it will release a lot of juices) for 15-20 minutes, or until it's developed a browned crust. Then add the pork along with the juices into the slow cooker or pot.\n\n\\- Another option is to quickly pan fry the pork after it finishes cooking. And I mean quickly, otherwise you'll lose all of that tenderness you put in all that work for. Well, not physical work, this is super easy.

{"title": "Order matters! Add your spices to the pan before the liquid when making soups, sauces, or stews.", "selftext": "Certain spices, including herbs, release more flavor in fat than in water. Cooks Illustrated did an [experiment](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6581-blooming-in-oil-for-flavor) where they found up to 10x more flavor compounds when spices and herbs were steep in oil than fat. So cool, right?!\n\nPlus fat is magical. It carries flavor and permeates it throughout the dish. This is especially great for whole spices, like fennel seeds, where you can taste the fennel even if you never have a bite with fennel seeds in it.\n\nSo always give your spices a chance to \"bloom\" directly in fat for 30 seconds. Whether that is with onions, carrots, and celery that you've been sauteing for a soup or ground beef you're browning in a pan for bolognese, add your spices before your liquid.

They are really easy and fun to make.", "selftext": "As well as being delicious, this cr\u00eape batter is superior to other batters because you don't need to let it rest before making cr\u00eapes and you don't need to butter the pan between each cr\u00eape.\n\nIf you're interested, I've made a whole video on the history of Candlemas and how to make cr\u00eapes, which you can checkout here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddqvAM1AAyg&lc=UgyCNeDz5CfXh2VRW7p4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddqvAM1AAyg&lc=UgyCNeDz5CfXh2VRW7p4AaABAg)\n\nOtherwise, here is the recipe.\n\nFor 24 cr\u00eapes, you will need:\n\n\\- 250g of Flour (0.55 lbs)\n\n\\- 60g of Butter (2.1 oz)\n\n\\- 5g of Salt (0.2oz)\n\n\\- 6 Whole Eggs\n\n\\- 600ml of Milk (2.5 cups)\n\n\\- 4tbsp of Water\n\n\\- 4tsp of a Strong Liquor (such as Cognac or a Dark Rum)\n\n(The original recipe asked for twice as much salt but that was too much. If the cr\u00eapes feel bland, add a pinch of salt.)\n\n1. Heat your milk on a medium-low stove up until it's just about to boil. Do not let it boil as milk spills over very easily.\n2. While your milk is heating, put your flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the middle, break your eggs into it, and whisk them together. When the flour and eggs are well combined, add the water, salt, and liquor, and whisk again.\n3. When your milk is warm enough, take it off the stove, add the butter and mix them together. When the butter is melted, slowly pour it into your batter while vigorously whisking the batter as to avoid forming lumps.\n\nVoil\u00e0! Your dough is now ready. As I've said before, you can immediately use it to make cr\u00eapes, which are a great and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.\n\nTo make a nice cr\u00eape, take a shallow and wide pan (22 cm/8.5 inches) and put it on high heat. Put some butter in the pan and once it's melted, grease the whole pan with a piece of paper. You only need to butter the pan for its first cr\u00eape. When the pan is nice and hot, take your batter, whisk it again to mix incorporate any flour that fell to the bottom (I recommend doing that regularly), take a large scoop of batter and pour it onto your warm pan. Spread it evenly, let it stick a second or two, and then pour any excess batter back into the bowl.\n\nLet the cr\u00eape cook for a couple of minutes. Once the cr\u00eape sticks off by itself, you can flip it. I recommend just picking it up with your fingers for that. Let it cook for a minute or two on the other side and enjoy it warm with any spread you like.\n\nAs a topping, I strongly recommend trying out \"Cr\u00e8me de Marron\" or brown sugar with lemon.\n\nBon app\u00e9tit!\n\nI really hope you give these a try.

{"title": "Here's how I make perfect copycat Egg McMuffins at home. It's easy, cheaper, and better.", "selftext": "[Here's the short video version](https://youtu.be/easwekHnUCg)\n\nYou can make a perfect Egg McMuffin at home in less time than it takes to go through the drive through. This tastes just like what you get from the golden arches, except better. If you aren't convinced to try it yet, it's also way cheaper, about $1 per McMuffin. So now that I've got your attention, let's make one.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nEnglish Muffin\n\n1 Egg\n\nA splash of milk or water\n\n1 Slice American Cheese (or any kind if you want to change it up)\n\n1 Slice Canadian Bacon\n\n1 Pinch each Salt and Pepper\n\nA little butter (optional but recommended, we are recreating fast food)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Heat skillet or griddle over medium heat. Melt in butter and add in each English Muffin slice side down. Toast until lightly browned, about 1 minute, and set aside.\n2. Melt in a bit more butter and add Canadian Bacon to the pan. Let sizzle for about 30 seconds per side or until it's crisped up how you prefer. If it starts to cup up, you can press down on it to get even coverage.\n\n\\*Note: If you are using a larger skillet or griddle, steps 1 and 2 can be done at the same time.\n\n3. While cooking the other ingredients, grease a microwave-safe mug with cooking spray or just a bit of vegetable oil and crack in an egg. Add a splash of milk or water (don't skip this part, it helps get a fluffy texture in the finished egg), as well as a pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk together until combined.\n\n4. Set your microwaves power to Medium (using High can result in a rubbery egg), and microwave in 30 second intervals until set, but still light and fluffy. For 1 egg, this takes about 1 minute in my microwave, so just a couple of rounds.\n\n5. Assemble the muffin sandwich with cheese, egg, and Canadian bacon. Add the whole thing back to the still-warm pan, cover, and let steam for about 30 seconds. Enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\nI had to use my small skillet because my larger one is in the shop, but even doing this one piece at a time only took me about 5 minutes. If you have a larger cooking surface, it's easy to do everything at once and have it done in 3.\n\nIf you want to cook multiple eggs at once in the Microwave with this method, use the biggest mug you can and follow the same instructions with up to 3 eggs. Keep a closer eye on them as they rise as they cook, and fall a bit as they cool. Once done, you'll be left with a beautiful E G G C Y L I N D E R. Slice it into circles of your preferred size. Looks weird in cylinder form, but once cut, each one is perfect for the muffin.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kdlsrq/heres_how_i_make_perfect_copycat_egg_mcmuffins_at/", "created_utc": 1608039216.0, "score": 511, "author": "southerngentleman90", "num_comments": 49, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kdlsrq/heres_how_i_make_perfect_copycat_egg_mcmuffins_at/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "10 years after I started cooking, I have some advice for you all", "selftext": "tl;dr Learn to cook ingredients, not recipes.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see people make when they first try cooking is to immediately start looking up recipes that sound delicious, but which are way too involved. This causes a few problems for the new cook:\n\n1. Every element provides one more opportunity to ruin the dish.\n\n2. Following recipes like that will leave them with extra ingredients that they don't know what to do with. They might need 1oz of goat cheese, but were only able to buy an 8oz pack. Since they're new, they don't have a bunch of ideas about how to use the extra goat cheese, so it ends up expired in the fridge. This is wasteful, and makes cooking as expensive as eating out. \n\n3. They never learn to handle the actual ingredients outside the context of the one recipe, and they might get the idea that a specific method will *only* work in the context of that recipe.\n\nSo learn to cook the ingredients first! There are dozens of different temperatures and methods you can cook a boneless, skinless chicken breast prepared with salt, pepper and olive oil. Try a few! Start it in a pan and finish it in the oven, go entirely in the oven, or entirely in a pan. See what works. Once you know how to cook a chicken breast reliably, it's really easy to then make it fancy, experiment, and start adding elements with basically zero risk of failure. \n\nThe other thing I'm not sure everyone realizes is that *it's okay to just keep it simple*. Even people like me who can cook complicated recipes keep it simple most of the time. Steam some greenbeans, bake a chicken breast, roast some brussel sprouts. Those ingredients are all delicious prepared simply, you really don't need to involve a lot of extra stuff. Sure, I could've made roasted green beans with shaved almonds and lemon zest, pan-seared, bone-in chicken breast with creamy mustard sauce, and bacon fig brussel sprouts with a balsamic reduction, but I'd have spent forty more dollars, spent 2 more hours cooking, and I'd have a fridge full of partially used ingredients that I'd have to figure out what to do with. \n\nThat's not something you can do every day, and I think all the effort can really turn people off to cooking entirely, especially when you spend the money and time, but end up with a bad tasting plate of food because you don't understand the ingredients. \n\nSo new cooks, master those ingredients! Your path to cooking greatness will be a lot smoother, and a lot cheaper (and probably a lot healthier too!).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/8tjx46/10_years_after_i_started_cooking_i_have_some/", "created_utc": 1529866177.0, "score": 505, "author": "nimoto", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/8tjx46/10_years_after_i_started_cooking_i_have_some/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Hello everyone, this Sunday is \"La Chandeleur\" (Candlemas), where it's traditional to eat cr\u00eapes for an entire day in France. I wanted to share my family's recipe so you guys can celebrate too. It's very easy and fun to make.", "selftext": "As well as being delicious, this cr\u00eape batter is superior to other batters because you don't need to let it rest before making cr\u00eapes and you don't need to butter the pan between each cr\u00eape.\n\nIf you're interested, I've made a whole video on the history of Candlemas and how to make cr\u00eapes, which you can checkout here: [https://youtu.be/ddqvAM1AAyg](https://youtu.be/ddqvAM1AAyg)\n\nOtherwise, here is the recipe.\n\nFor 24 cr\u00eapes, you will need:\n\n\\- 250g of All Purpose White Flour (2 cups)\n\n\\- 60g of Butter (1/2 stick of butter)\n\n\\- 5g of Salt (1 and 1/4 teaspoon of salt)\n\n\\- 6 Whole Eggs\n\n\\- 600ml of Milk (2.5 cups)\n\n\\- 4tbsp of Water\n\n\\- 4tsp of a Strong Liquor (such as Cognac or a Dark Rum)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(The original recipe asked for twice as much salt but that was too much. If the cr\u00eapes feel bland, add a pinch of salt.)\n\n1. Heat your milk on a medium-low stove up until it's just about to boil. Do not let it boil as milk spills over very easily.\n2. While your milk is heating, put your flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the middle, break your eggs into it, and whisk them together. When the flour and eggs are well combined, add the water, salt, and liquor, and whisk again.\n3. When your milk is warm enough, take it off the stove, add the butter and mix them together. When the butter is melted, slowly pour it into your batter while vigorously whisking the batter as to avoid forming lumps.\n\nVoil\u00e0! Your dough is now ready. As I've said before, you can immediately use it to make cr\u00eapes, which are a great and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.\n\nTo make a nice cr\u00eape, take a shallow and wide pan (22 cm/8.5 inches) and put it on high heat. Put some butter in the pan and once it's melted, grease the whole pan with a piece of paper. You only need to butter the pan for its first cr\u00eape.   When the pan is nice and hot, take your batter, whisk it again to mix incorporate any flour that fell to the bottom (I recommend doing that regularly), take a large scoop of batter and pour it onto your warm pan. Spread it evenly, let it stick a second or two, and then pour any excess batter back into the bowl.\n\nLet the cr\u00eape cook for a couple of minutes. Once the cr\u00eape sticks off by itself, you can flip it. I recommend just picking it up with your fingers for that. Let it cook for a minute or two on the other side and enjoy it warm with any spread you like.\n\nAs a topping, I strongly recommend trying out \"Cr\u00e8me de Marron\" or brown sugar with lemon.\n\nBon app\u00e9tit!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope you give these a try. They are tasty, easy and fun to make and you can put any toppings you like on them so it's really a great way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/euuwdz/hello_everyone_this_sunday_is_la_chandeleur/", "created_utc": 1580161041.0, "score": 490, "author": "None", "num_comments": 46, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/euuwdz/hello_everyone_this_sunday_is_la_chandeleur/", "html_title": ""}

I'm so happy that I got it from the first time!", "selftext": "So I'm George, and as some people may know or not, I try a lot of different recipes for the first time, as I recently started to get into cooking!\n\nAnyway, enough about me. Some pictures with the pancakes https://imgur.com/gallery/LRRfo9C and I used this recipe : \n \nIngredients : \n - 5 Cups of Flour\n - 2 Tsp salt (or a little more if you want them salty)\n - 2 Cups of Almost boiling water\n\nFor the oil that you need to brush them before rolling\n\n - 6-7 Tblsp of vegatable oil + 1 tblsp of sesame oil\n - Salt and spices that you enjoy. Garlic, Onion powder. \n - 4 Tblsp of flour\n\nFor the filling : \n\n - Fine chopped Scallions and Cheese\n\nProcedure : \n\n - You start by adding the flour in a bowl along with the salt and then the hot/almost boiling water. Mix it at low speed with the mixer, or use a wooden spoon.\n - Mix until everything combies and is not sticky. When you put your finger on the dough it should come out clean.\n - Let it rest for 10-15 minutes to cooldown a little covered with a plastic sheet and prepare the oil.\n - Put everything in a sauce pan and mix it at a low heat constantly to not get lumps of flour. When it starts to boil, you're done. \n - Now, cut the dough in how many peices you would like. I cut mine in 8 smaller ones because is easier to fry them.\n - Roll them thin enough with a rolling pin, but not really thin. You should not be able to see trough it. You should have in mind 2 things. \n - Long ---- and wide |   You should make it longer than wider. But keep in mind that the wider it is, the more layers you will have and those are a pleasure when you eat it.\n - After you roll the dough, brush it with the oil, this will help keeping those layers to not stick. Add the fillings Cheese, Scallions but be sure to not overfill.\n - After that, roll it as tight as you can from the wide part with your hand. Now you should have a roll. Take 1 end and roll it to the other. Press everything with the palm of your hand, add a little flour, and use the rolling pin to thin and form the pancake. Don't press TOO hard on it, and it doesn't matter if it brakes a little here and there. \n - Fry in hot oil (don't deep fry), 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.\n - You can enjoy it with some cream cheese! \n\nI really hope this will help someone to make it at home. They're SUPER GOOD and a pleasure to eat. Just watch some videos on how to exactly roll the dough because I can't explain it more than this, and you're done. All you need is 1 bowl to mix things together. You can customize them with different spices, or even try different kinds of cheese in the filling. You can also just make them with ONLY scallions if that's something you enjoy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jaag81/i_made_chinese_scallion_pancakes_im_so_happy_that/", "created_utc": 1602583506.0, "score": 488, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jaag81/i_made_chinese_scallion_pancakes_im_so_happy_that/", "html_title": ""}

Having all your cooking equipment hung up in easy reach is so much nicer than jammed in a drawer or a countertop utensil-pot. Especially if you hang them in the same spots every time -- you almost don't have to look before grabbing what you need!

A question on another sub reminded me that I meant to bring it up here.\n\nBeans! A centuries-old staple of civilization for a reason: they're cheap, filling and nutritious. And just between you, me, and the fencepost, and everyone on the Internet...if you season a meatbeanloaf the same as a meatmeatloaf it tastes almost the same. You can use other beans if it's all you have but black beans are more seamless in terms of flavor.\n\nA simple and thriftish meatbeanloaf recipe for beginners:\n\n* Preheat oven to 375F. Turn on some music.\n\n* In a mixing bowl, dump a drained and rinsed can of black beans and smaush them with a potato masher or a fork into a coarse paste.\n\n* Add the ground meat, one raw egg, and up to 1/2 cup of Italian breadcrumbs. Italian ones are better because they keep you from having to math out individual herbs and spices. Also dash in some pepper and a little Worcestershirecestshireerceshire.\n\n* Mix good.\n\n* Pat the mix into a small and deep baking dish. You *can* spurt the dish with cooking spray first if you want a crispier edge, but - as with most cases of edge you get from the internet - it's entirely unnecessary.\n\n* Bake in the oven for 35 minutes.\n\n* Pull the meatbeanloaf out and brush it with a glaze. For the sake of simplicity on a sub for beginners, just liberally pour some good BBQ sauce on it and stick it back in the hot box.\n\n* Bake for 10-15 more minutes. If you want a little more caramelization on your glaze you can broil on LO for a couple of extra minutes but this isn't required for deliciousness - I just think it's neat.\n\n* Serve and enjoy, basking in the satisfaction that you have now cut your monthly meatloaf bill almost in half.\n\nShit.

{"title": "I love to pan fry some ramen noodles with butter, garlic, and Italian seasoning but what are some easy additions to change it up?", "selftext": "Or even some new flavor profiles would be nice too.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t believe somebody gave me gold for ramen! Very sweet, thank you! \n\nI\u2019m really glad this has gotten so much attention and that everyone can get some great new ideas for a really simple meal!! \n\n\nI\u2019ve put it in a few comments below how I usually prepare my noodles but since I\u2019m here already, I\u2019ll put it here too for ease of access. \n\n\n1. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. You only need a few cups of water (basically how much water you would use to make a decent bowl of soup and maybe a splash more). It doesn\u2019t need to be a roiling boil either, just a handful of bubbles that aren\u2019t tiny sticking to the bottom of the pot and a handful of them rising to the top\n\n2. Add your packet of ramen and boil for 2-3 minutes. Just until the noodles start to pull apart from each other. If you\u2019re using a standard top ramen pack, you notice when the two \u201chalves\u201d aren\u2019t sandwiched together anymore. \n\n3. Drain the water. Don\u2019t be me and burn your fingers. Do this carefully like a responsible adult. \n\nI start to heat my pan with butter and oil right when the noodles go in, but having more than one pot going can be overwhelming for brand new cooks, and it honestly doesn\u2019t do anything except get your noodles on the plate half a second faster. So don\u2019t sweat it. \n\n4. Heat a pan with butter and oil. Or just oil. But I\u2019ve found that butter alone it\u2019s hard to get a good fry on the noodles so if you like butter add at least a splash of oil. I use about 2 tablespoons of butter (or \u201cpads\u201d of butter).  Eyeball it. Don\u2019t fret on measurements. Life is too short that shit. \n\n5. Add noodles when butter is melted. I cheat and use a jar of chopped garlic, but if you use fresh garlic be sure to prep it before hand. Add garlic and Italian seasoning to the noodles. Just sprinkle the seasoning. Again, nothing too crazy. Use a little more than you would pepper. \n\n6. Stir it around a bit. But I like to leave mine untouched for a minute or two to get a good crisp on the noodle. Sometimes I\u2019ll leave it a little longer then \u201cflip\u201d my noodles and get some good crunch on the other sides too. \n\nThen eat it. \n\nAlternatively, if you like the package of seasoning, add about half of the package instead of the garlic and Italian seasoning. I use half of it because it is a crazy little salt bomb. If you want more, then go for it. You\u2019ll notice the seasoning start to \u201ccook into\u201d the noodles. It makes it super good.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/ej4y8v/i_love_to_pan_fry_some_ramen_noodles_with_butter/", "created_utc": 1578001919.0, "score": 472, "author": "MorganAndMerlin", "num_comments": 85, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/ej4y8v/i_love_to_pan_fry_some_ramen_noodles_with_butter/", "html_title": ""}

Forgiving, simple, cheap, versatile, and delicious.", "selftext": " \n\nThey aren't going to win any beauty contests, but they are delicious, easy, and cheap.\n\nI always eyeball the ingredients to scale for how many I need to cook, but here's a basic list so you can see the ratios:\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n2 cups AP flour\n\n2 to 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in general you want about 1 teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour)\n\n1 teaspoon white sugar\n\nPinch of salt to taste\n\n1/2 cup chilled butter (make sure it's cold)\n\n1 1/4 cups whole milk (also make sure it's cold)\n\n**Method**\n\nMix the flour, baking powder, and sugar together. I like to put a bit of salt as well, although it's not necessary.\n\nTake the cold butter and cut it into small pieces and add to the flour. At this point I use my hands to coat the butter chunks in flour and break it up by hand. I do this mostly because I'm lazy with dishes so I just do this whole recipe mixing with my hands. I've seen folks lightly freeze the butter and then use a cheese grater to add it in, which seems clever. I just keep it simple, the goal is simply to end up with small (maybe pea-sized) bits of still solid butter.\n\nAdd the cold milk a little bit at a time, mixing until a wet shaggy dough forms. Once again, I use my hands, but a spoon is probably the preferred method. What we want is a texture similar to an extra-thick flapjack batter, but a big thicker. It will be a bit sticky so don't worry about that. This is a fast and loose recipe, so don't worry about perfection.\n\nOnce a loose dough/batter is formed, it's time to drop those biscuits. Lightly oil a baking sheet and grab chunks of the dough and drop 'em on there. I go with slightly larger than golf ball sized, but this recipe ain't about being precise. Don't worry too much about shape, these are supposed to be tasty, not necessarily pretty.\n\nBake until golden brown at about 425 degrees. Usually this will take about 12-15 minutes, but just keep an eye on them and pull them when they look nice.\n\nTry to contain your excitement and give them a minute before devouring.

{"title": "Cooking black beans the right way makes a huge difference!", "selftext": "Since most of our meals start with beans as a base (for ease and cheap factor) we thought it was time to share [the ultimate way to cook them](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-cook-black-beans/). I also added everything you need to know about them. \n\nI feel like nailing a cheap ingredient can seriously make cooking much more budget friendly. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, tips, and suggestions for cooking black or other kinds of beans. \n\nHopefully this helps you whether you're a new cook or one that's more experienced. \n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n[***US Customary***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-cook-black-beans/#) \\- [*Metric*](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-cook-black-beans/#)\n\n* \u25a22 cups dry black beans ($0.76)\n* \u25a2Water\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS \n\n* First, rinse the beans in a colander to remove dirt. Then, sift through them to make sure there are no rocks or anything that can damage your teeth after cooking.\n\n#### Stovetop\n\n* If you're using a regular pot, ensure you soak the beans beforehand. Add all beans to a large container full of water about 2-3 inches over the beans. Let the beans soak for 8-12 hours, or overnight.\n* **Quick soak**: if you're pressed for time, fill a pot with water and your beans. Bring the water to a boil for about 2-3 minutes, then take it off the heat. Let the beans sit in the water for 2 hours. **Note**: if you use this method, your beans may not stay whole during the cooking process.\n* Once soaked, drain and rinse your beans. Add them to the pot and cover with 3-4 inches of fresh water. Cover with a lid on and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, stir and reduce to a low simmer.\n* Cook until your beans are tender, about 1 \u00bd-2 hours depending on how old they are. Stir the beans occasionally throughout cooking to prevent sticking. **Note**: if your beans are looking dry at any point, add in more water (hot, not cold water). Once cooked, season to taste with salt and any other flavorings you want.\n\n#### Stovetop pressure cooker\n\n* If you are pressure cooking the beans, soaking is not a requirement. We only recommend soaking them in this method if you're having digestive issues.\n* Again, add your rinsed beans to the pressure cooker and cover with 2-3 inches of water. Make sure you don't fill the pressure cooker more than halfway or just over (this is for safety reasons).\n* Put the lid on, double-checking it's in the locked position and the safety valve is down. Turn your stove to high until you hear a \"hissing\" noise coming from the pressure release valve and the safety valve is up (this means it's pressurized).\n* Then, turn the heat down to low and start your timer for 40 minutes. Once the time is up, turn your stove off and allow the pressure cooker to naturally release, about 10-15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and any other flavorings you want.\n\n#### Electric pressure cooker\n\n* Similarly to the stovetop pressure cooker, soaking is not a requirement. We only recommend it if you're having digestive issues.\n* Add your rinsed beans to the pot and cover with 2-3 inches of water. As with the stovetop pressure cooker, make sure you don't go past the \"max fill line.\"\n* Put the lid on, making sure the pressure valve is closed. Set your pressure cooker for 30 minutes on high power. Once the timer goes off, allow your pressure cooker to naturally release, which takes anywhere from 10-30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and any other flavorings you want.\n\n### NOTES\n\n* 1 serving = \u00bd cup cooked beans.\n* The most ideal (and safest) way to release your pressure cooker with beans inside is the natural release method.\n* All pressure cookers are made slightly different, so it's best to read your manual for the most accurate instructions, cook times, and safety mechanisms.\n* Optional ingredients are not reflected in the price or calories of our recipes.\n* Nutritional information is a rough estimate.\n* Recipe cost calculations are based on ingredients local to us and may vary from recipe-to-recipe.\n* All prices are in USD.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kw2u00/cooking_black_beans_the_right_way_makes_a_huge/", "created_utc": 1610491756.0, "score": 416, "author": "BrokeBankVegan", "num_comments": 47, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kw2u00/cooking_black_beans_the_right_way_makes_a_huge/", "html_title": ""}

Once I started taking my BREAST'S off the heat at 165, it was life changing.*\n\nBut you don't do this with say, thighs for example... *especially* bone in - skin on thighs.\n\nI think this is a common mistake for new cooks who think \"Gatta take the chicken off at 165!\" and they they are like \"Why are my thighs rubbery and gross?\"\n\nBecause dark meat has fat and juice and skin that can take more heat. You want that meat to almost fall off the bone.\n\nTake some bone-in chicken thighs. Pre-heat your oven to 400. Turn convection off if you have it. Cover them in some seasoning salt or lemon pepper.

I\u2019m looking forward to moving out again, but really not excited about dealing with cooking for myself again.\n\nMy anxiety seems to stem from two places: the idea of cooking new things, and a very extreme fear of messing up and being judged by the people around me (even someone commenting positively on what I\u2019m making is enough to set me off sometimes). I definitely eat healthily, and I did always make food for myself rather than relying on takeaway, but I seem to cycle through the same incredibly basic combinations of food constantly. \n\nMy family only really eats the same basic meals that I can already make, and I\u2019m a picky eater anyway because of what I suspect are sensory problems, so I haven\u2019t got a clue about a lot of meals.

{"title": "Emulsification for dummies, plus how to make a smooth cheese saucee", "selftext": "Emulsification. I can barely even say it. You've probably heard it said a lot on cooking shows. So to get it out of the way, Wikipedia defines an emulsion thusly: \" An **emulsion** is a [mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture) of two or more [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid) that are normally [immiscible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immiscible) (unmixable or unblendable) owing to liquid-liquid [phase separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_separation). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) called [colloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid). \"\n\nThat's a fancy-pants way to say it but you guys know I like to be super-scientific. To put it simply, to emulsify something is to mix together two things that don't like each other, like oil and water. Add the word to your daily vocabulary so you can feel superior when you force it into conversation and people only vaguely know what it means, likely from context clues.\n\n**How does this apply to cooking?**\n\nEmulsification comes into play a lot with food. Probably the most visual example is a vinaigrette, which at it's core is an oil and vinegar (or often other acidic liquid) mixture. You can easily make your own vinaigrette by mixing oil and vinegar (or citrus juice, etc) together and giving it a good shake. When you shake it enough, the oil and vinegar will emulsify from the physical action. For a bit you will have a tasty homogenous vinaigrette, but over time the oil and vinegar will begin to separate again. For a freshly made vinaigrette that's not a big deal since you can just shake it again, but what if you want to keep a mixture emulsified for longer? That's why we need:\n\n**MORE INTIMIDATING SCIENCE WORDS!**\n\nTo make the water and oil stay friends for longer, we need to introduce a chemical of some sort into the equation. Think adding booze to a party so the people are more open to mingling. There are many chemicals used to aid in the emulsification process, and chances are you consume them every day. A few common ones are *lecithin*, *sodium phosphate*, and *diglycerides*. I'm sorry if that gave you a spook, but I did warn you about more science.\n\nLet's go ahead and take the venom out of those words. Lecithin is found in egg yolks. Sodium Phosphate is prevalent in processed cheese like Velveeta or American cheese slices. Diglycerides (and other 'glycerides) are found in things like coffee creamer or some baked goods. To really mix it up, detergents like dish soap are surfactants, a type of emulsifier. They bind the oil and water together so you can clean it up with a cloth, or more water. We use emulsifiers and stabilizing chemicals all of the time without even realizing it!\n\n**You haven't even talked about the cheese sauce!**\n\nOh yeah! If you've made cheese sauce at home before, you've probably noticed that melted cheese wants to return to it's solid form as it cools off. The heat and stirring helped it to emulsify, but it's not stable. Some cheeses don't even want to emulsify in the first place and are nearly impossible to make a melty sauce with. Or are they?\n\nJ. Kenji Lopez-Alt has [A great write-up](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html) on how to make a nacho cheese sauce using cornstarch and evaporated milk that inspired me to learn more about the process. I'm about to get all mad scientist for a second but hear me out.\n\nI don't typically have evaporated milk on hand but I wanted creamy cheese sauce. I researched and found that the reason this works is that evaporated milk typically contains both an emulsifying agent and a stabilizing agent. It contains sodium phosphate, for example. You know what else contains a lot of emulsifiers and stabilizers? **American Cheese**. Also known as processed cheese product, these melty slices of \"cheese\" are actually only about half cheese. The other half is added things to make it melt easy and stay melted, like sodium phosphate! As a result, it has an extremely mild flavor and is full of emulsifiers.\n\nSo what about the cornstarch? It's the thickening agent that keeps the sauce from getting too liquidy. If you have a bag of pre-shredded cheese, look at the ingredients and find that you already have cornstarch. It's typically added to the cheese to keep it from clumping up while it sits in the bag. Of course if you're melting a block cheese you'll want to add a bit of cornstarch to thicken up the mixture, but I'm all about efficiency.\n\n# Let's make melted cheese!\n\nThis can be used to make a silky cheese sauce (that stays melty for a while) with a few ingredients you probably already have. And since I've also melted our brains with science, I'll keep it dead simple. Note that the American cheese will not add much flavor, if any. For example, if you make a gouda sauce, it will taste primarily of gouda while being melty like American cheese.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nSOME SHREDDED CHEESE\n\nA SLICE OF AMERICAN CHEESE\n\nSOME MILK\n\nMAYBE SOME BUTTER\n\nFLAVOR STUFF IF YOU WANT\n\n**Instructions**\n\nIf using butter (I do), slowly melt it over medium low heat. It's important to keep the heat fairly low.\n\nStir in a bit of milk, enough to submerge the amount of cheese you chose. Heat for a minute or two.\n\nAdd in shredded cheese. Only you know how much cheese sauce you'll want, but a standard size bag is a safe bet. You can save it and reheat it later, so don't be shy.\n\nStir for a couple of minutes as the cheese melts to the desired consistency.\n\nAdd in a slice of American Cheese. Melt for a minute or two while stirring it into the mixture.\n\nOnce everything is nice and combined and the consistency is where you want it, serve hot with literally anything. I could eat cheese sauce with a spoon.\n\n**Notes**\n\nI know this was a long read that lead up to a vague recipe, but I find that understanding the basic science behind ingredients, interactions, and methods makes cooking more fun. It allows us to go off of the beaten path, so to speak.\n\nThis works with most cheeses as far as I know. Kenji's method works a bit better, but I don't keep evaporated milk around and a lot of household's always have american cheese, so I feel my off-brand method is worth sharing.\n\nOur emulsion, while nice and longer lasting than a standard melted cheese, still won't last forever. Once this sauce spends some time at room temp or in the fridge, it will slowly start to thicken. The good news is that it heats up very well! Sprinkle a little water on it and microwave it in 15-30 second intervals, stirring in between, until it's silky smooth again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jh9kts/emulsification_for_dummies_plus_how_to_make_a/", "created_utc": 1603548710.0, "score": 395, "author": "southerngentleman90", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jh9kts/emulsification_for_dummies_plus_how_to_make_a/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "I just made some bomb ass spaghetti from cheap dollar store sauce so I gotta share", "selftext": "We've been having some money troubles cause of everything so our dinners have been...not the greatest. I will normally pick up cheap pasta sauce because while I know you can normally make a ton of it from scratch with ease, sometimes jarred pasta sauce is just the best because you can open it up and it's done. The problem is that jarred pasta sauce always leaves more to be desired so I always try to find a middle ground on sprucing it up but keeping it easy.\n\nWhile boiling the water I combined the following in a very small pot on medium heat (5), I'll explain how to cut each since it's a little odd:\n\n\u2022 1 tbsp olive oil\n\n\u2022 Half a jalape\u00f1o (I hate spicy foods and this wasn't much at all, it's just for a depth of flavor rather than straight heat)\n\n\u2022 Half a shallot\n\n\u2022 Half a 4oz can of mushroom stems (no sodium added)\n\n\u2022 Fourth of a green bell pepper\n\n\u2022 3 garlic cloves\n\n\u2022 Salt to taste, I used about a teaspoon\n\n\u2022 Half the jar of the canned pasta sauce (8oz is what I used for half a box of pasta)\n\nCut the jalape\u00f1o directly down the stem, take out the seeds, then dice into very small pieces. Half the shallot directly down the stem, then dice into small pieces. Mushroom stems you can leave together or chop as small as you want.  Take the flat side of the green bell pepper and slice off one of its walls, de-seed if any and then chop into small pieces. Combine all of these with the oil for five-ish minutes. Then dice the garlic (or use a garlic press which I highly recommend to everyone), add that in with salt and cook on low (3) while the pasta cooks.\n\nWhen you have 5 minutes left on your pasta, add the jarred pasta sauce with the rest of the ingredients and stir, still on low, to meld the flavors. Once the pasta is done you can combine.\n\nEach of the ingredients can be put in a bag to use later in other ways. The pasta sauce was a dollar, so 50\u00a2 since I only used half, and each other ingredient was about 25\u00a2 or less once you divide it by how much used. I made enough pasta for three people on only $3 and it was mind-blowingly good.

{"title": "Tutorial on How to Cut some Basic Vegetables", "selftext": "Hi r/cookingforbeginners. I made a tutorial on how to cut some basic vegetables. Nothing fancy, just some fundamental knife skills. Figured you all might want to see it too. \n\n[Check it out here if interested.](https://youtu.be/NOO77T5omu0)\n\n**Tomatoes**\n\n* Lay the tomato stem side down\n* Make Slices down and as close to the bottom as possible without cutting through it\n* Rotate the tomato 90 degrees and repeat step 2\n* Lay the tomato on it's side such that the stem is facing the wall\n* Cut downward to dice the tomato up\n* Once you get to the end, it should only be a slice of tomato left. Cut it into chucks as desired\n\n**Cucumbers**\n\n* Slice\n   * Lay the cucumber down and slice downward, make sure\n* Diagonal Slice\n   * Angle either the knife or the cucumber at 45 degrees and slice downward. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Half Moon\n   * Split the cucumber along its length, then slice normally. This is good for when you want to slices to be smaller to match other ingredients in the dish   \n* Diagonal Half Moon\n   * Same as the regular half moon, just angle the knife or the cucumber\n* Quarters\n   * Split the cumber in half lengthwise like for the half moon, then lengthwise again to quarter it\n   * Slice as normal\n* Deseed\n   * Slice lengthwise just like you do for the quarters\n   * Lay the cucumber spears with the seeds facing up\n   * Lay the knife parallel to the ground and slice across the cucumber, cutting out the seed pods\n* Julienne/matchsticks\n   * Deseeded\n      * Lay the deseeded cucumber spears with the deseeded side down, this is because it's a flatter and more stable surface - making it safer\n      * Slice into matchsticks\n   * Regular\n      * Cut the cucumber into long cylinders\n      * Lay the cylinder on the cut side up so it's a tube sticking straight up, then slice downward into planks\n      * Stack the planks on top of each other and slice into matchsticks\n\n**Celery**\n\n* Cube/Chunk\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Cut into chunks of desired size\n      * If you want, you can cut the celery in half lengthwise, then make the cuts for a smaller dice\n      * These cuts are good for mirepoix, sofrito, Louisiana Holy Trinity, and other veggie bases\n* Slice\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n* Diagonal Slice\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Angle the knife or the celery at 45 degrees and cut. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Julienne\n   * Divide the celery into halves, thirds, or quarters depending on desired matchstick length\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on.\n   * Turn the celery so that it's length runs parallel to the wall/perpendicular to you\n   * Slice celery into desired julienne/matchstick length\n\n**Peppers**\n\n* Julienne/Matchstick\n   * Top and tail the pepper - ie cut off the top and bottom\n   * Lay the pepper upright and make a downward cut to open up the pepper\n   * Lay it on its side and unroll the pepper\n   * Cut out the seed pod and remove any wayward seeds\n   * Slice the rolled out pepper into julienne/matchsticks sizes as desired\n*  Dice\n   * Line up the julienne/matchsticks and cut into desired dice size\n\n**Cabbage**\n\n* Slices/strips\n   * Cut the cabbage into quarters as it's large size is unwieldy\n   * Make a V-Cut to remove the core. It's thicker than the leaves and thus cooks differently\n   * Lay the Cabbage so that the exposed core is facing the opposite wall\n   * Slice the cabbage into strips. BE CAREFUL as you get closer to the base as it's less stable there. So slower is better there\n\n**Carrots**\n\n* Roll Cut\n   * This is a special cut because it makes a unique shape AND you can tailor the size of the cut pieces to match each other and thus get even cooking\n   * Cut a chunk out at a 45 degree angle. \n   * Rotate the carrot 180 degrees and make another 45 degree angle cut\n   * Repeat these cuts, but change the length of the cut so that each piece has roughly the same thickness\n* Slice\n   * Cut a THIN sliver down the length of the carrot and lay the carrot on this new cut side down. This alleviates the round shape of the carrot and makes a stable and safer base to cut on\n   * Slice as desired\n* Diagonal Slice\n   * Repeat the thin sliver cut above\n   * Cut at desired angle\n* Dice\n   * Cut the carrot into sections (halves, thirds, etc) then cut those sections into planks of equal size\n   * Stack up the planks and cut into spears of the same thickness\n   * Line up the spear are cut into dice of desired size\n* Long Julienne\n   * Cut the carrot into planks as detailed above\n   * Stack planks and cut into juliennes of desired length and width\n* Short Julienne\n   * Make the Diagonal slices detailed above, but on a HEAVY bias\n   * Stack up the slices and cut into matchsticks\n\nLet me know if there are other vegetables you want to know how to cut!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/ocfpu2/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables/", "created_utc": 1625249330.0, "score": 379, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/ocfpu2/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables/", "html_title": ""}

Family members have given us the green light to leave the raw, seasoned chicken on the kitchen counter until it\u2019s time to cook it tomorrow. It\u2019s a lot of chicken.\n\nThese family members have been cooking for large gatherings since before I was born. Everyone seems very okay with the idea. And after a Google search, I\u2019ve even seen a few posts about others who have done the same thing with no problem. Also, I have definitely eaten some questionable food in my life. I\u2019ve never had any bad reactions. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful to them. I don\u2019t want to disrespect them by insisting on refrigerating the chicken if it will probably be fine.\n\nEdit: Okay. So it\u2019s not an option to leave the chicken out. Any ideas on how to insert the chicken into the fridge without being disowned? This is my SO\u2019s family. I\u2019m just the girlfriend \ud83d\ude2d.\n\nEdit: I have placed the chicken inside of the fridge. It absolutely sucked. I had to move a bunch of things around, so they immediately caught on to what I was doing. First they whispered about me putting the chicken into the fridge after we had all clearly discussed it. Then they said \u201cHey OP, are you putting the chicken in the fridge\u2026.??\u201d I kinda fumbled around an answer. \u201cYeah, we have enough space in the fridge, so I figured I could just put it in there.\u201d In that moment, I was literally installing an extra shelf in the fridge to accommodate all the chicken. They laughed at me lol. It was pretty funny, but there\u2019s still a taste of disrespect in the air. Awful experience. I feel terrible. I\u2019m sure my partner is going to ask me about it later tonight.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s the morning after. The chicken is in the oven. Last night my SO asked me why I started taking shots with her mom out of nowhere.

Her immediate response was \u201cOh my God I\u2019m so glad you did that!!!\u201d She then admitted that is was her that started the whispering about me putting the chicken in the fridge.

{"title": "General Post - How to shop for groceries", "selftext": "It feels like it's every day that I see a post on here asking for advice on how to shop for groceries and I kind of feel like there should be a general post for it that gets shared where everyone can pitch in their advice so hopefully users can find it with a search or be easily linked it if it comes up.  So here is my two cents on the matter.\n\n* Shopping isn't one size fits all, find what works for you with trial and error\n* Food waste will happen, don't feel like you're failing when it does. Try to incorporate excess into other meals when possible or just buy as much as you need\n* How often can you shop and how accessible are the shopping locations? This should affect if you are buying fresh or shelf stable and the quantity you buy\n* If you are just starting out, try to buy just what you need for the recipe you are attempting\n* If you have a number of recipes that you like to make regularly, keep the shelf stable staples of those recipes stocked and try to buy them when they go on sale to stock up\n* Don't be turned off from dishes that require a large number of hard to find or new to you ingredients, there are often simpler versions of those recipes you can find with a quick bit of google searching\n* Build your spice/seasoning/sauce/oil/vinegar/salt selection as you try recipes. Don't go out and buy a big spice rack, chances are the spices are old and more than half of them you will likely not use. If you find that you keep using a particular spice then start buying it in bulk. Use a mix often? Try making it yourself, it can often be cheaper and better quality.\n* To save money, keep track of all of your typical pantry staples and whenever you go shopping for other items keep an eye out for those items when they are on sale. Keeping your pantry and spice cabinet stocked with basics really opens up the number of dishes that you can make quickly and easily.\n* Bulk deals can be tempting, but they really only make sense if you are actually going to be able to eat it all before it spoils. Remember that many items can be frozen for long term storage.\n\n\nHere is my process for grocery shopping. I use an app called \"Flipp\" that allows me to make a grocery list and each item on that list gets cross checked against all my local grocery stores weekly flyers. As I'm going about my day, if I use something up, I'll add it to my list. For example, I just used up the last of my lemon juice, so I immediately added it into the list and next time I'm shopping I'll look for it. I shop flexibly, not really on a set schedule. Any time I need to go to the store for something specific I need for a planned meal, I use that as an opportunity to pick up anything that I'm low on.\n\nSo I will:\n\n* 1. Identify a recipe I want to make\n* 2. Identify the ingredients I need to pick up for the recipe\n* 3. Add them to my grocery list and check for sales\n* 4. Go to grocery store and pick up the items I need, plus anything else on sale that I could use\n* 5. Properly store and divide things up as soon as I get home\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of saving money while shopping I can offer some more advice. First of all, compare quality/quantity/weight and not just price. Products often come in different sizes and qualities and even though something is cheaper at one store, it might not necessarily be the same product or same amount.\n\nPre-packaged fresh foods like vegetable platters and salads often cost way more than what it would be to prepare it for yourself. If your goal is to just feed yourself and you don't have time then I think they are an option, if you want to prepare your own food then buy the component ingredients and assemble them yourself. The quality will often be better and it will be a better value.\n\nKeep tabs on your most expensive food items and take advantage of sales and your freezer whenever you can. My most expensive items are meat (often chicken or beef in varying forms), butter, and cheese. All three of these things freeze really well. And sales on them can often be found where you can bulk up. This has the possibility of cutting down your food bills dramatically and also ensuring you have major components available after a thaw for upcoming dishes.\n\nDifferent stores are often better at certain things, or give better deals on certain things. In my town there are four different grocery stores that I have quick access to and a farmers market. Depending on what I'm buying, I might selectively shop in one place over the other based on quality and price and how local the food production was.  You'll get a feel for what stores are better at what when you are more experienced.\n\nDifferent items might also come in different forms and the price could be considerably different. I like to cook with beans, you can buy them canned or dried and while dried is less convenient for preparation (often requiring a soak overnight and longer cooking times) they are considerably cheaper and store for longer with less weight and space.\n\nAlways be wary of bulk deals, unless it's something that you use regularly and won't expire quickly then is it really a good value if half of it goes into the garbage? \n\n\n\nThis is all I've got, anyone else want to chime in?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/i6v78y/general_post_how_to_shop_for_groceries/", "created_utc": 1597021647.0, "score": 373, "author": "None", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/i6v78y/general_post_how_to_shop_for_groceries/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I made pork chops with a mustard honey sauce", "selftext": "This is my best plate I made yet for sure. I really enjoyed it, and that sauce was amazing. \nI always was afraid of making sauces, but it wasn't that hard. I don't know if is a \"professional\" way to make a sauce, but that's my take on it. It tasted REALLY, REALLY good. \n\nPictures : https://imgur.com/gallery/bEtViHz\n\nSo...recipe right?\n\nIngredients :\n\n - Pork chops      \n - 1 red bell pepper (to taste)\n - half red onion (to taste)\n - 2tbs Dijon Mustard\n - 1-2tbs honey\n - 1/2tsp corn starch (if you use more liquid depending on the noodle soup, you can adjust)\n - 1/2 lemon or 1 lime\n - 1 instant noodle soup with pork spices\n - 3-4 garlic cloves\n - some butter\n\n(to taste means that you can put less or more, is not a deal breaker) \n\nProcedure :\n\nOk so, in my experience, pork chops without bone are not the most tender meat you can get. But\nto make it tender, I personally marinade it for 1-2 hours in orange or pineapple juice, then wash it a little\nand then put a dry rub on it, let it sit for 1 hour at room temp and then cook it. Never cook it cold.\nWith this one I skipped the marinade, but it was ok. \n\nYou should make your noodle soup. I think that's pretty simple to make and don't need any instructions. Just make sure after you're done with it, separate the noodles from the soup.\n\nSo, for cooking pork chops. I had a dry rub that had (2tsp white pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, 1tsp of paprika, black pepper and very little nutmeg)\nYou want some hot oil in a pan (I used vegetable oil), and cook the pork chops for around 3 to 4 minutes on each side depending on their thickness THICC.\nI personally love when they get a crust. Don't move them when you put them in the pan. Another thing for making them tender is that when you flip them, cook for 1 minute at the same heat, and then put a lid on and go for low-medium flame.\nIt will lose some crunch from the curst, but you will get them tender. Another way to cook them is to give them a fast crust on each side, and then put them in the oven. I don't think that's needed tough. Anyway when you flip them, put some butter in\nand the cloves of garlic. Remove the garlic when they're done.\n\nAfter you're done cooking them, put the pan on low flame or off the flame for a few seconds. Throw in your diced bell pepper, let it cook for a few seconds, then throw in your small diced onion. Cook at low flame for around 1 minute or so.\nThen the weird part, but trust me, it is REALLY good. Put the noodle soup in, along with the mustard, honey, lemon/lime juice and some of that dry rub spices. Let it simmer/boil a little. You want to reduce it a little but not all the way.\nI'd say after it gets to simmer, let it at medium heat for around 1 minute.\nAt this point mix half of teaspoon of corn starch with a splash of water in another bowl, and then put it in the sauce to make it thicker. I do this because I want more sauce. Reducing too much of it, isn't gonna help me here if I need more.\nMix it and let it simmer for half of minute, and then put the pork chops back for another minute. Sprinkle some cilantro and you're done. Let the pork chop rest for 5 minutes before cutting it.\n\nPut the noodles in a plate, cut the pork chops, put it on top of the noodles, put more sauce and enjoy!\n\nIt is simple to make. The problem is that it takes some waiting time.

For instance, I lived in an apartment for over a year and during the second half of the second year, a girl I started dating asked if she could cook dinner and I said of course and she asked about turning on the oven and I said I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve never turned it on. That was after I went out and bought some necessary kitchen items before she came over so it didn\u2019t look like I\u2019d never cooked.\n\nFor whatever reason, I decided I wanted to learn to cook. I\u2019d like to be a little more healthy and obviously, there are many benefits to cooking versus take out. Well, I tried to replicate some YouTube videos and those just didn\u2019t seem to be very good at actually teaching you how to cook versus just getting you to replicate what they\u2019re doing on screen. I think on this sub, I found the website Rouxbe. Seems decent, some problems but overall better than anything I\u2019ve discovered so far. \n\nThey seem to stress learning to use a pan to cook, makes sense, so I go ahead and order an All Clad D3 stainless pan because of course that\u2019s the key to being a good cook. I also order an induction cooktop because while my apartments nice, it\u2019s just got this terrible little electric range that didn\u2019t matter to me because I don\u2019t cook! I read about how to properly use the unit versus having a gas or electric stove and decide to try and do one of Rouxbe\u2019s first exercises: heating up a stainless pan!\n\nI am like, even I can\u2019t screw this up. Boy, was that a stupid assumption. I read a couple induction conversion charts and set the temperature to 300 which is 30\u00b0 below what they list for the default frying temp. Well, Rouxbe teaches you to get the pan hot enough that it forms a mercury type ball of water when the pan is optimal frying temp. Long story short, I put water in the pan every 15 seconds to determine if it\u2019s hot enough and all I ever end up with is a burned looking pan with heat flashing marks.\n\nSo, I read on the Internet you can get rid of them with vinegar and that seems to work good enough that I wasn\u2019t in tears that I ruined my brand new pan. I decided OK, induction wasn\u2019t for me, I\u2019ll use my crappy electric range that\u2019s tilted even though I tried to fix it from being off balance. I put the pan on medium heat and put in a quarter teaspoon of water every 30 seconds or so. When it gets hot enough, the water starts sizzling the second it hits the pan but never the mercury ball thing. Well, at the six minute mark, the pan seems to do the mercury ball thing. I am elated despite the fact that my pan looks burned with water spots even though I was wiping them up with a towel the whole time between tests. \n\nSo, I move to the next step which is putting a little bit of oil in as though you would do were you cooking. I know all about smoking points and what to use but they used extra-virgin olive oil and I figure it\u2019s fine since I didn\u2019t have anything else. I put in a tablespoon or so and immediately it starts smoking like I was using a big green egg. I just stare at it and want to die because clearly, this test is also a failure.\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/fNw0chq/3-F399-BB3-A142-439-A-9-AD7-A1-F120-F0997-B.jpg\n\nThat\u2019s my pen before I hit it with any vinegar but I just can\u2019t stress enough how disheartened I am that doing something as basic as trying to heat up a pan seems to be an incredibly hard task. It\u2019s why I never became a cook, I would try and boil spaghetti to put some Prego sauce on it and I would somehow manage to over boil and under cook the noodles and screw up the meat, etc. Additionally, one of the courses on this web program was learning to cut vegetables and how to use a knife. It wasn\u2019t as bad a ailure but I was absolutely awful at being able to hold my knuckles correctly and move them back as I\u2019m cutting which after practice left me with an incredibly sore back because I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d and I think the countertop is too low.\n\nWhen I\u2019m in the shower I watch all these great cooks like the guy that says \u201cuntil next time guys and gals and non-binary pals.\u201d and while I know it\u2019s like watching LeBron James and asking why can\u2019t I play basketball as well as him but dudes just eyeballing times and temps and forgetting stuff on burners but it not mattering. ...it\u2019s just frustrating. \n\nSo anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent and I hope tomorrow is a brighter day. I\u2019ll keep at it but I am not too optimistic that I\u2019ll eventually get to the point where I can wow my future family with my skills and instead I\u2019ll just be that dad that can make one thing on the grill and my kids love it anyway. \n\nCheers.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t thank you guys enough. Did not expect this kind of response. You guys are awesome and I appreciate you hanging around, willing to give your advice and encouragement. It means a lot to people. I will try to individually respond to you all and again, thank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mmgax7/failing_to_even_learn_how_to_properly_heat_up_a/", "created_utc": 1617843080.0, "score": 359, "author": "lincolninlawrence", "num_comments": 65, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mmgax7/failing_to_even_learn_how_to_properly_heat_up_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Flamed Out Chef's Unsolicited Valentine's Day Cooking Advice", "selftext": "Cooking for her? Cooking for him? I'm a flamed out chef with a couple simple tips..before everyone gets bent out of shape for this being particular, I just want to help people from many years of cooking for friends, family and my Valentine...\n\n1. Invest In Wine Glasses\n\nThat $14 Malbec might as well be from Francis Mallmann\u2019s personal cellar when served in a sleek, crystal glass. Your friends can drink out of mason jars when they come over, but for special occasions, it\u2019s nice to have two nice glasses.\n\n2. Cold Open\n\nIf you can assemble Ikea Furniture, you can assemble a salad. It\u2019s not so much cooking as it is placing ingredients on a plate. Take the pressure off yourself and start cold.\n\nSay what you will about Jamie Oliver, but this is about as good of a round up of creative, easy and fun salads as we have ever seen. Make one of those or go with our simple bruschetta.\n\n3. Candles + Music = Good Vibes\n\nCandlelight and a chill music will make food taste better. You know what songs they likes, but we like going foreign or live. Don\u2019t overlook throwing on a full live album, jazz or whatever Van Morrison does is nice. Or try someone like Federico Aubele, a talented singer-songwriter from Argentina. Sometimes not understanding the words is relaxing and creates flow. Or ignore the above and just play tunes from their Spotify, even better\u2026\n\n4. Make The Main Course Together\n\nThe less they are standing there watching you cook, probably the better. So build your own personal flatbreads or pizza. Just buy a bunch of cured meats, some good mozzarella and fresh greens. It\u2019s more fun and interactive. If you feel like that\u2019s too lazy, just make the homemade pesto or sauce beforehand.\n\n5. Let\u2019s Not Do Dinner\n\nThey might still want a nice dinner out, but a brunch or breakfast is a nice gesture from scratch.\n\n6. Cook Something With A Story\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what to serve for the main event, serve something personal. Your Mom\u2019s Goulash, the Larb recipe you learned backpacking in Northern Thailand, the bolognese you stole from Uncle Tony, nobody will refute your logic and it makes dinner more interesting.\n\n7. The Most Crowd-Pleasing Dessert I Know\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because it stirs up notions of adolescent nights around the campfire or because it\u2019s cozy as hell or because it\u2019s a big mug of liquid chocolate but fresh hot chocolate made with real chocolate is a winner. Make sure you go to a specialty shop in your area and get artisan (yes fancy fancy) marshmallows. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s delicious and nobody has ever said \u201cAhhhh really hot chocolate? I hate hot chocolate.\u201d\n\n8. Don't Be Afraid To Fail\n\n\\*\\*THE MOST IMPORTANT TIP\\*\\* - Cooking for someone is endearing and always should be appreciated.  Even if you screw up, the effort gets noticed.  You can always order takeout.\n\nPS: Please include your tips below, I love to learn!\n\nThank You!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/110fmj9/flamed_out_chefs_unsolicited_valentines_day/", "created_utc": 1676208174.0, "score": 360, "author": "ReggieMilligan", "num_comments": 41, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/110fmj9/flamed_out_chefs_unsolicited_valentines_day/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Roman (and other cheese/oil based) pastas 101", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I originally wanted to make this guide for a friend of mine, but I figured some people on here also might be interested. \n\n**1: Why roman pastas? Aren't they a little too difficult for beginners?** \n\nFigured I'd address this right off the bat, because I see this pretty often where these types of pastas are talked about online like they're high forms of art that require years to master. \n\nI really think that this is a big misconception, the reason these pastas seem difficult is because people don't really understand why/how these sauces become creamy. Once you have a handle on that, these sauces are super easy.\n\nIn addition, they're\n\n* Delicious\n* Pretty cheap  \n* Quick to make\n* Have a short ingredient list, and most ingredients last a long time\n* Seem a lot more impressive than they really are\n\n**2: What's a roman pasta?** \n\nHere are the big 4\n\n* Cacio e pepe\n* Pasta alla Gricia\n* Amatriciana\n* Carbonara  \n\nAnother two common ones that I like to lump under the same umbrella (even though they are not roman pastas) are\n\n* Cheese based pesto sauces\n* Cheese heavy variants of aglio e olio\n\nThe thing that all these pastas have in common is that their base is some kind of oil (butter, olive oil, or pork fat), combined with some kind of hard cheese (usually Pecorino Romano or Parmesan), then combined together with pasta water. Just to reiterate, the core of these sauces is **oil + cheese + pasta water** and this guide should hopefully work for any similar sauce.  \n\nMy personal favorites out of these 6 (and the two I find easiest) are Pesto and alla Gricia. - the ingredients lists I use are [here](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/classic-pesto-109802) and [here](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pasta-alla-gricia.html). Carbonara is by far the most difficult out of these because of how easy it is to overcook egg - It's the only one I wouldn't recommend to beginners.\n\n**3: Cream, cream, cream, pasta water, pasta water, pasta water.** \n\nThis is the #1 source of confusion and mistakes, so I think it deserves its own section. If you understand this you'll make great pasta.  \n\nI want to preface this by saying *I'm not some kind of traditionalist for the sake of being a traditionalist.* If it tastes better using non-traditional stuff, I'm all for that - I add fish sauce to half my recipes, so when I say not to use cream it's not out of some reverence for the old way of cooking. I personally hate the common explanation you hear online of \"If you use cream, it's not traditional, and you can't call it cacio e pepe.\" This kind of snobbery turned my off of these pastas for the longest time. If I thought adding heavy cream made these pasta sauces taste better, I would absolutely do that. \n\nThe reason I don't is that **cream makes these sauces oily, not creamy**.\n\nThis goes into some really basic science which is more of a 201, but you can skip down to the TL;DR\n\nThe first question to answer is \"wtf makes a sauce creamy in the first place\". I'm sure you have had loads of creamy sauces before like Hollandaise sauce or salad dressings, but you might be surprised to learn that most of those sauces don't actually have cream in them. Sauces *feel* creamy when they're a mix of water and oil. That's really it. Water + oil mixed together feels creamy. \n\nBUT WAIT - Water and oil don't mix! \n\nThat brings us to our 3rd ingredient, an *emulsifier*. This is a pretty sciencey word but it really just means something that can stick to both oil and water, and will keep the two together creating a creamy sauce.  There are a lot of emulsifiers used in cooking, egg yolks are a great example and they're the main emulsifier in things like mayo or most salad dressings. Another great emulsifier is starch, usually from flour. This is what's used in the roux-based sauces you see in french/new-orleans cooking.\n\nStarch is also present in *you guessed it* pasta water! This is your emulsifier when working with pasta sauces. **Pasta water is what makes the sauce creamy**. \n\nCream does contain emulsifiers, but they are already being used keeping the fat and water that's already in the cream stuck together - if you add extra oil on top of that there won't be enough to keep it together, and you can end up with a sauce that has a layer of oil on the top. \n\nSo, TL;DR\n\nOil + Water + Emulsifier = Creamy sauce\n\nPasta water = Water + Starch \n\nPasta water + Oil = Creamy sauce\n\nOil + Cream = Oily cream sauce\n\n\n**4: My general strategy**\n\n* Get out two pots/Dutch ovens. One for the pasta, the other for the sauce. Doing the sauce in a pot with a tall rim makes it much easier to stir it vigorously without worrying about spilling.\n\n* Make a tasty oil. This usually means cooking pork in it, roasting garlic, blooming pepper, etc. Whatever your recipe calls for. If your oil tastes good so will your sauce.\n\n* Once your pasta is al dente, save about 2 cups of pasta water and add the pasta to your sauce pot. I usually start off adding 1/4 cup of the saved pasta water to the sauce pot right away. Turn the heat to low. \n\n* Start adding in the cheese, a handful at a time, while stirring vigorously.\n\n\nNow, one of three things will happen \n\n* Sauce looks perfect  \n\nEasy, good job champ. This means you just magically added the perfect amount of pasta water on your first try. If you're a beginner this usually will not be you. \n\n* The sauce is \"soupy\" \n\nCook the pasta/sauce mix for a bit longer. Cooking your pasta al dente gives you a bit of breathing room, you can usually give your pasta a few more minutes before it gets overdone. You've got 3 things working in your favor here 1) Water boiling off, 2) Pasta absorbing water, 3) Pasta releasing more starch, thickening it even more. If your sauce is a bit soupy *don't worry* usually in a minute or two it'll be perfect.\n\n* The sauce is oily and/or the cheese starts to clump together.\n\nADD PASTA WATER! Keep stirring vigorously. This is the most common problem and it is solved by pasta water and stirring. Also, if you run into this, don't panic! You can still usually save your pasta, just add pasta water generously and stir. If you consistently run into this, start adding more pasta water before you start adding your cheese.  \n\nThis is really the whole formula. 99% of people who mess up either don't finish their pasta in the pan with the sauce, or give up if the sauce isn't immediately perfect. Just finish the sauce in the pan and remember OILY = More pasta water, SOUPY = Cook another minute. \n\nThen, serve it ASAP. Note that the pasta will continue absorbing water after serving, so if you're making it ahead of time it's possible that your sauce that was perfect on the stove will be oily by the time people are eating it. Add extra pasta water accordingly. \n\n**5: Misc tips**\n\nThe cheese:\nMost of these sauces can be either made with pecorino, parmesan, or a mix. If you don't have a source for great parmesan cheese I personally recommend using pecorino. America has a lot of 'trap' parmesan cheese, which is either really overpriced or really bad, pecorino on the other hand tends to be more consistent in terms of price/quality. I personally get [this from trader joe's](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nu3Nu8er5Ew/WtXOtWHB3aI/AAAAAAAAf6c/mODCXN-DqCQX1iXq7JTgkZZwNZPzv0uBACLcBGAs/s1600/DSC05666.JPG). Pecorino tastes a bit sharper and saltier than parmesean, I only recommend parmesean you really want a more mellow sauce. \n\nSubstitutions: Many of these recipes call for italian cured porks like gianciale or pancetta. A lot of grocery stores have these, but a lot of them also don't. You can also use Pork Belly or thick cut bacon for these recipes. If you use pork belly you're going to want to add extra salt, if you use bacon you usually want to use a brand that doesn't add too much smoke flavor since that can sometimes overpower a dish (although, sometimes it also comes out great). Really though the core of all these sauces is just pasta water + oil + cheese, so in general you shouldn't worry too much about straying from the exact recipe. \n\nReheating for the next day: One thing I don't see mentioned often is that these pastas are almost always terrible by the next day. The once creamy sauce has been replaced with a puddle of oil. The problem is that the pasta has absorbed  some of the water in the sauce, leaving the oil behind. The solution is to add a few tablespoons of water before reheating, which should hopefully let you recover your creamy sauce.\n\nEdit: I totally forgot to mention, If you\u2019re new just use dried pasta. Fresh pasta is easy to tear to shreds while stirring. If You\u2019ve made the recipe 10x in a row without running into any clumps you can try it out with fresh. I personally prefer it with dry even then but ymmv.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jubqu7/roman_and_other_cheeseoil_based_pastas_101/", "created_utc": 1605396980.0, "score": 343, "author": "aahdin", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/jubqu7/roman_and_other_cheeseoil_based_pastas_101/", "html_title": ""}

(I'm using eyeball measurements because we never measured anything Besides pizza sauce ingredients) you'll need a whisk but If you don't have one a fork is fine you just have to work harder. This is a fast process so be ready. It makes about 2 servings, or 1 if your looking to have a really big bowl.\n\nPut a pan on your stove and set it to low heat. Then over the sink or trash can crack an egg. And save only the yolk. Carefully pass the yolk back and forth in the half shells and cup them together to remove all the egg white. Once that's done put the egg yolk to the side within reach. \n\nNext turn your heat up between medium/high. Put a slab of butter in and swirl it around until it's melted or close to it (about a tbsp).\n\nPour in half a carton or so of heavy cream (I think it's a 1 pint carton I buy at home?) Then add some salt, and a good amount of black pepper. And whisk frequently. \n\nWhen bubbles begin to appear put in your egg yolk and whisk thoroughly. It will most likely be getting ready to boil. When this happens pour in some grated parm, then whisk. \n\nTurn your heat down to low and keep adding parm and whisking until it taste how you like it. (you should be tasting throughout this whole process) \n\nFor some great added flavor add a sprinkle of garlic powder at the end and whisk it in good. \n\nTake it off heat and either add your fettuccini to the pan or pour the sauce over your fettuccini in a bowl. Allow it to cool some so it thickens. In the restaurant we always added the fettuccini to the pan.\n\nIt's delicious. You may have to play around with it to get it to your taste. We used to add fresh chopped parsley on top but it was more of a garnish than flavoring.

What can I use it for?", "selftext": "TL;DR honestly nothing below this is necessary to answer the question. I\u2019m just chatting. The only helpful thing I have to say that isn\u2019t in the title is that I\u2019m looking for ideas where I can brown the cheese or otherwise reduce the creaminess of it.\n\nI am not huge on melty/creamy cheese, but my college roommate occasionally made an EXCELLENT spinach artichoke dip that I absolutely loved. I probably ate her recipe\u2014or a similarly high quality one\u2014about once or twice a year.\n\nSeveral months ago, I mentioned offhandedly to my old roommate in front of my partner that I was craving her dip. He secretly obtained her recipe and has been waiting to surprise me with it.\n\nProblems:\n\n1. He does not cook and it did not occur to him that maybe he should reduce the recipe.\n2. The recipe serves 20 people.\n3. I saw him making it but didn\u2019t stop him because I assumed it was for him. Because I had *also* incorrectly assumed that he liked it, because he suggests it at restaurants sometimes, but he only did that for my sake.\n\nResult: we have about a gallon of spinach artichoke dip that made me gag upon smelling it. Neither of us are jazzed about eating it.\n\nI\u2026 am at a loss of what to do other than toss it after a few days of nibbling on it. We can\u2019t throw a party and feed it to guests because we don\u2019t know anyone in the area. So what do y\u2019all think? Freeze it? Make tarts? Put it on bread and roast it??\n\nEdit: your suggestions are being put to use as applicable :) thank you. I also got a lot of worried responses about my relationship.

Soak 1 cup rice for 10 to 20 mins. If you are a large family, you can make more rice(upto 3 cups) following the same method. Add rice to a large bowl. I have used 3 cups long grain basmati rice. You can also use any long grain or medium grain like Jasmine rice, Sona masoori.\n\n2. Meanwhile pour about 10 cups of water for 3 cups of rice to a large pot and bring it to a rolling boil on a medium high flame. When the water begins to boil add the rice.\n\n3. Add 1 tablespoon salt to the boiling water. Add rice.\n\n4. Keep checking so you don\u2019t overcook. This only takes a few minutes. Cook the rice and not mushy. Grains must be separated yet fully cooked.\n\n5. Quickly drain the rice to a colander. Cool it until all of the steam vanishes. Fluff it up with a fork. If the rice is perfect you can cover and set aside. This prevents the rice from drying & becoming hard.\n\n6. When completely cooled add \u00bd tablespoon of Vinegar to rice. Mix well. Leave in the fridge for 10 mins. This is optional. Doing so will give rice a good texture that best suits for Chinese fried rice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 2: Fried Rice\n\n1. Heat oil in a wok or pan on the highest flame. Add green onion bulbs, garlic, green chillies, & chopped onions.\n\n2. Saute for 2-3 mins.\n\n3. Add the vegetables and saute 5 mins.\n\n4. Add the cooked rice. Mix well.\n\n5. To it add, Schezwan mix powder. Mix thoroughly.\n\n6. You can add more pepper powder & salt if needed.\n\n7. Finally, garnish with green onion stalks.\n\nSchezwan Fried Rice is ready.

{"title": "What are easy beginner dishes?", "selftext": "Hey guys. I\u2019m just gonna give an overview of myself so you get an idea of the type of dishes I intend to learn. \n\nI\u2019m 19 and still live at home. However, I plan to move out by the end of the year. I used to cook and bake a little bit when I was 12/13 but not really since then. Im going to start going to the gym this week and I have a \u00a335 budget for food/cooking each week. I work 5 days a week at a cinema which is surprisingly tiring. Due to this, I need food that\u2019ll keep me energised and full but won\u2019t lead to me being bloated and tired. \n\nI come from an African household so rice is a daily meal for me and in all honesty, I\u2019m sick of it. Due to this, I\u2019d like to learn dishes that utilise things like pasta, quinoa and other healthy alternatives but also taste good. I will be eating home cooked dishes but they generally contain a lot of oil which is what I aim to avoid, especially since I plan to eat a lot healthier. I love meat in my food and I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s from chicken, lamb, fish or whatever. Any dish with meat is a dish that I\u2019ll eat. \n\nSince I have a fairly tight budget of \u00a37 per meal, I\u2019d like food that\u2019s cheap and affordable while still staying healthy and tasting good. I\u2019d like some variation with the meals but I\u2019d not mind eating pasta 3 times a week and rice 2 times a week. \n\nI\u2019d also like to know what to cook sea bass with.

Then cut it in half pole to pole, going through the gnarly root but leaving it attached.\n* Lay it down on the cut side and make cuts horizontal/parallel to the onion without going all the way through to that root\n* Turn   the onion so that the root faces away from you and make   vertical/perpendicular cuts across the onion, again making sure not to   cut all the way to the root\n* Finally   turn the onion 90 degrees so that the root faces away from  your knife   hand and make vertical/perpendicular cuts again to get evenly  diced   pieces\n\n**Tomato Soup Recipe for Diced Onions**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1x Onion, Diced\n* 1x 28oz Can of Tomato Product\n* 1/2 Stick of Butter\n* Salt to Taste\n\nJust   throw it all into a pot and bring it to a boil, then lower the heat   to  a simmer (should bubble like a flat soda). Let it simmer like this   for  45 mins, check for saltiness, and that's it!\n\n**Slicing an Onion:**\n\n* Cut to top and root off the onion, then cut it in half pole to pole\n* Lay the cut side down and face the onion so that now removed root end faces away from you\n* Make   vertical/perpendicular cuts across the onion, the knife should  slice   all the way from one pole to the opposite pole with each motion\n* Try to space the cuts as close to each other as you can, being careful  once you get towards the end to not cut your fingers\n\n**Onion Fritters for Sliced Onions**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1x Onion, Sliced\n* 1x Cup Flour\n* 1x Egg\n* \u00bdx Cup Water\n* \u00bcx tsp Salt\n\nMix   all the above in a bowl till you get a chunky batter. Pour a good  layer  of oil in a pan till and heat till it shimmers. The drop a   spoonful of  onion batter into the oil. Cook it on one side for 2 mins,   flip it,  then cook again for another 2 mins. Salt it after removing  from  the  oil.

{"title": "Don't be too quick to discount instant ramen.", "selftext": "People may dismiss instant ramen as being cheap and disgusting, but with a little creativity, they can be a part of something delicious, especially for those on a tight budget.  To be clear, I am talking about those rectangular packages of deep-fried noodles with the extra salty seasoning pack sold four for a dollar or even cheaper.  They are a staple of dorm room and prison cuisine but are possibly one of the most versatile of highly processed foods.  Now, I will never say that they are the healthiest of ingredients, but I will say they can be delicious and fast and fulfilling.\n\nThe following are a couple of the dishes I have made over the years, one when I was a broke college kid and had nothing but a microwave to cook in, and one that I still make to this day.\n\nBacon Fried Rice style Ramen (feeds 2) (microwave only meal)\n\n* Thin fatty meats like bacon cook fine in the microwave.  Dice 4 rashers of bacon and put in a 1-quart microwave-safe bowl.  Cook 30 seconds at a time stirring each time until desired crispiness.  I can't tell you how long because each microwave is different.\n* Spoon the bacon out of the bowl onto paper towels to drain.  Leave as much grease as possible in the bowl.  Stir in a couple tablespoons of small diced onion and nuke for 1 minute.  Stir in a quarter to half cup of frozen vegetables and nuke for 2-3 minutes.  Spoon out onto the paper towels.\n* Crack an egg in the bowl and scramble thoroughly.  Nuke 30 seconds at a time stirring each time until cooked.  This takes a minute and a half most of the time.\n* While it is still in the packages, crush 2 packages of ramen into rice size bits.  I have found the best flavors for this dish are chicken, pork, chile, or chile-lime. Put the ramen in the bowl with one of the seasoning packets.  (Save the other to use on another dish as flavored salt.  I like it on popcorn.)\n* Add 3 cups of water and nuke for 4 minutes then let sit for 4 minutes.  Drain thoroughly and stir all the ingredients in.  Add in soy sauce to taste.  I found one and a half to two packets leftover from Chinese takeout are sufficient.  Also, those little canisters of chile oil go nice too.\n* Share with someone you want to impress with your microwave cooking skills.\n\nChicken Ramen hobo dinners (each pouch serves one) (adapted from a Good Eats recipe but I am allergic to fish, so . . .  I adapted)\n\n* Preheat oven to 400 F\n* Tear off a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil about a foot square.\n* Open a package of ramen, throw away the seasoning packet, and place in the center of the foil.\n* Cover the noodles with a layer of asparagus cut to the size of the noodles.  (I have tried Julienned onions and bell peppers, zucchini with the seeds scooped out and cut into 1-inch chunks, and carrots cut to bite-size pieces.  All are good, but the asparagus is my favorite.)\n* Sprinkle with salt\n* Liberally season a bone-in chicken thigh with salt, garlic powder, pepper, and hot paprika and place it on top of the asparagus.  By now you should have a tower of potential dinner.\n* Fold and crimp the aluminum foil up so that it makes a bowl that holds the tower in place.\n* Pour in a quarter cup of white wine or water and then squeeze in a wedge of lime.\n* Place on a sheet pan and bake 45 minutes to an hour or until the internal temp of the chicken reads 180 F.  If the skin starts to get too dark, crimp the packet mostly closed for the remainder of the cook time.\n\nThe juices from the chicken flavor both the vegetables and the noodles and the clean-up is a breeze.  Also, I can customize the packets for each of my kids.\n\nI hope these recipes inspire you to give instant ramen a chance in your kitchen.  If you have any ideas on how to elevate this humble ingredient, let me know.\n\nEdit:  typos", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/qqp7r0/dont_be_too_quick_to_discount_instant_ramen/", "created_utc": 1636530576.0, "score": 297, "author": "withouta3", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/qqp7r0/dont_be_too_quick_to_discount_instant_ramen/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "An Asian's guide to boiling vegetables (1/2)", "selftext": "Heya, first time posting here. Boiling really is one of the ultimate \"newbie friendly\" cooking method but usually turns out into a mushy, bland disappointing mess. I'm here to give you some tips on how to cook this to my idea of \"good\". This first part will be for a simple, one ingredient dish.\n\n\\- Choose the right thing to boil. Not everything is going to taste good boiled, so when in doubt, ask the friendly neighborhood Asian (or me) for advice on what to boil. The safest options are daikon radishes, carrots, watercress and cabbages.\n\n\\- Clean the vegetables. We want to drink the cooking water for the nutrients, so clean your ingredients thoroughly. I'd recommend rinsing and shaking the leaves in a sink full of water to get out all the dirt. Carrot and other tubers' peel make the water taste bad, so peeling would yield better results.\n\n\\- Season the boiling water. Not as much as pasta water, a small pinch per 2 liters should do. I like it so that the dish won't taste bland, but not enough to actually taste the salt in the veggies. A little bit of MSG if you're okay with that is nice. Put as much as the salt.\n\n\\- If cooking a leafy green, let the water come to a rolling boil before adding the vegetable, and keep it on high heat for the whole time. The shorter cook time keeps the green luscious color from turning into a pallid yellow.\n\n\\- Keep the cooking liquid. If you have peeled the veggies and cleaned thoroughly, what you would end up with is a sweet, mild tasting stock the is full of nutrition. Squeeze a little lime in there for added flavor if you have some. Most acid would do the trick, just don't add anything that you wouldn't drink diluted with water.\n\n\\- Dipping sauces: try different combinations tbh. I'll embrace the stereotype and recommend fish sauce for everything. A little lime, minced garlic and tiny pinch of MSG and you've got a killer sauce for dipping vegetables.\n\nAnd there we go! That's how my mam taught me to do it, and I guess most of Asian history too. If I left something out or got something wrong, let me know! I'm a guy with a laptop, not a chef after all. Have a beautiful day my friend.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/oxvyp4/an_asians_guide_to_boiling_vegetables_12/", "created_utc": 1628093346.0, "score": 292, "author": "riceboyetam", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/oxvyp4/an_asians_guide_to_boiling_vegetables_12/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It\u2019s not the worst thing ever (I was very weary of touching my face and eyes) but still, shit hurts!

{"title": "Japanese Curry Recipe (very easy and nearly impossible to screw up)", "selftext": "My little 14 yearold cousin wanted to cook for his mom and his younger sister. He literally had never cooked anything before. \n\nI sent him this recipe and apparently it was a hit. Please forgive me for the recipe being overly detailed. My cousin had no experience in the kitchen, so I tried to spell everything out for him. \n\nJapanese curry is very easy and bullet proof. You literally can't f**k it up. \n\n1 package of Japanese curry mix\n\n1 white onion\n\n1 large russet potato\n\n1lb package of baby carrots\n\n2 tablespoons of soy sauce (or more to taste)\n\n2 tablespoons of oyster sauce\n\n2 tablespoons sambal (or Sriracha in a pinch)\n\n2 table spoons of butter\n\n2 1/4 cups of beef broth\n\n1 table spoon of minced garlic (from a jar)\n\n1- 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef\n\n1 cup of white rice\n\nDirections:\n\nCut the potato in half length wise. Cut those halves into quarters (length wise). Cut these smaller pieces into 3 or 4 pieces. \n\nDice the onion. I know that dicing can seem intimidating. Go slow and take your time. It ain't a race. \n\nMake the rice: Put one cup of rice in a small pot. Add two cups of water. Bring to a boil and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 20 minutes and then turn the heat off. \n\nIn a Dutch oven (or similarly sized pot) melt the butter on low heat. Add the onion and turn up the heat. Salt and pepper to taste. Stir and cook until translucent. \n\nAdd two tablespoons of garlic to the onions. Keep stirring for 1 min. \n\nAdd the ground beef to the pot. Break up the beef as it cooks with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add a table spoon of soy sauce and cook until the meat is browned. \n\nAdd the potato and the carrots. \n\nAdd 2 1/4 cups of beef stock. \n\nBring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer and put the lid on. \n\nSimmer for 15 minutes. \n\nAt the 15 minute mark, stab a potato with a fork and if slides right in with no resistance turn the heat off. If it is still not cooked through give it another five minutes of simmering time and then turn the heat off. \n\nBreakup the curry into 4 pieces and add it to the pot. Stir until the curry block melts and is incorporated thoroughly. \n\nAdd two table spoons of oyster sauce, the remaining tablespoon of soy sauce and the two tablespoons of Sambal. Stir to incorporate. \n\nTurn the heat back on and simmer for 5 more minutes.

I'm not (if we assume that eating boiled non-salty/too-salty pasta with tomatoes every day is not healthy and our goal) because I just simply hate cooking. I'm not totally green in all this, for example I know how to cook pasta al dente or that a carrot cooks longer than tomato, or that you don't just put cold sour cream into hot soup, but I'm definitely a beginning beginner.\n\nBig part of my cooking problem is how inexact  recipes are. I like baking, because there you have strict measurements - grams of flour, glasses of milk, 1/4 teaspoon of this and that - and baking temperature/time. In cooking, you don't; you get all the pinches of salt, little bits of sauce, frying until golden brown... how the hell am I supposed to know, if my pinch of salt is the same as recipe's writers pinch? (usually it's not).\n\nAll of that makes me so miserable in the kitchen. My food is always either too spicy or blunt. My chicken is always dry because I'm afraid I'll undercook it. If a cake goes wrong, I usually get a bit sad for a day but I'm ready to try again next day. If cooking goes wrong, I resent it for the next 3 months or more. I know you learn by mistakes, but for me mistake means no more trying for a looong time.\n\nThe irony is I love watching cooking shows, so I thought that maybe buying a cook book from someone I enjoy watching will help, so I got Jamie Oliver's \"Veg\" but it didn't really help that much - there's no meat in it so I didn't have to be afraid that I'll get food poisoning, but still the food was at best \"meh\".\n\nDo you have any tips how to overcome that resentment and what to do to minimalise errors during the learning process?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/fpdldv/how_to_learn_to_cook_if_you_absolutely_hate/", "created_utc": 1585237055.0, "score": 289, "author": "Ihana_pesukarhu", "num_comments": 75, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/fpdldv/how_to_learn_to_cook_if_you_absolutely_hate/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Asked my mother for advice on Meal Planning. Thought I'd share her response. (Long Read)", "selftext": "HeWhoAsksQuestions,\n\nI don\u2019t want to go on and on here, but I\u2019ve given your request about suggestions for meal planning a lot of thought.  Most everything I\u2019m about to write can be found plenty of other places, but these are some of the things that have served me well in the past as well as newer things I have come to realize could have served me better, but I didn\u2019t start doing them until fairly recently.  \n\nThe past few years I have become pretty sick and tired of meal planning.  It has been close to four decades, so I\u2019m entitled.  Still, I don\u2019t want to eat out every night either for a variety of reasons.  Hence, some of these ideas are fairly fresh for me.  Here they are in some sense of order. \n\n1.  As you prepare your meals, when you find one that works well, keep track of them in appropriate list titles.  After six months, you might have the following lists:  Good Pantry Meal; Quick Meal; Very Inexpensive; Works Well for Company; Takes Well to a Family in Need, etc.  You won\u2019t keep every meal you make on a list, but if you prepare a meal and find that it just worked out great, write it down in the appropriate category.  Example:  a good company meal is one that can be largely prepared ahead, isn\u2019t hugely expensive, doesn\u2019t need that much time to tend to once people have arrived; and cleans up relatively easily while people may still be there.  After a couple of years, you will have some great Go To lists to make planning easier.\n \n2.  In light of the above, we all tend to eat the same meals over a two or three week\u2019s time.  This isn\u2019t a bad thing.  If a family LOVES spaghetti, why not eat it once a week?  Mainly, use this suggestion to come up with two to three week\u2019s worth of meals that are usuals because it is easy.  If you have 14 to 21 meals in your pocket that can be made quickly and without much thought, that is a great asset.  Bringing me to:\n \n3.  Really, you probably don\u2019t eat seven dinners in one week.  You probably eat out once or twice, and you probably have a decent enough sized meal that you have leftovers for another meal that week.  I only actually plan for three or four meals a week.  That always leaves me plenty of room for substitutions, and I always have a quick pantry meal I can count on if I\u2019m unprepared.  More about that later.\n \n4.  As I mentioned above, I have gotten really sick of cooking dinners.  Dad really has no experience cooking, and without recrimination, he and I would both rather eat what I have prepared because it tastes better.  One of the things we have done the last few years is to start including him in the process more.  He is a willing sous chef, and he has started preparing more things.  How much basic information he doesn\u2019t have is always surprising to us both, and I have had to teach a lot of pretty basic stuff.  It is all fine though.  I\u2019m sick of the job, and he wants to help.  We both eat, and really it isn\u2019t very fair that the entire job of feeding us is always my job.  He has been a willing participant, and I have very much come to appreciate his help.  I sense Mrs. HeWhoAsksQuestions is in the same low skillset that Dad was.  My recommendation is that you both work on including her in the process more.  It is good for everyone in the family to help with food preparation, and you especially will appreciate it in 37 years.  Again, there is no recrimination here, but it is a good voice of experience giving the suggestion.\n\n5.  The best way to utilize a super market circular is to buy the loss leaders on the front of the circular and then fill in the gaps with what else you need from Walmart or Aldi.  We also shop about once a month at Costco.  If something you use a lot is on sale, then buy a lot of it.  Example:  ground beef for $2.59/lb.  Why buy two lbs. when you can buy ten and multiply your savings as well as your time?  Bringing me to:\n\n6.  Bulk prepare your meat.  It is the biggest time saver in a meal.  Bring home that ten lbs. of ground beef and brown it, drain it, and portion it into freezer ZipLoc bags.  Squish out the air, flatten them, label them (don\u2019t forget to label the date and the ounces), and store them in your freezer.  If you forget to defrost them, put them into a bucket filled with cold water (designated for this purpose and this alone), and they should defrost within 30 minutes or so.  (This bucket tip is a good one, FYI.  You can get food grade buckets.  I actually have to pick a new one up if you want me to get you one.)\n\n7.  In your lists that I suggested in No. 1, keep up a bunch of good pantry/freezer foods.  You will get to know them.  Frozen broccoli ziti sauce takes about 15 minutes to water bucket defrost and ten minutes to heat.  If you add chopped Italian sausage (also frozen and defrosted in the bucket), you can serve it over pasta and be ready to eat within 25 minutes of walking in the door.  There are lots of other good pantry/freezer recipes you can start to keep track of.  One of mine is the Tikki Masala sauce that you suggested from Aldi.  I heat that with a frozen ZipLoc bag of pre-browned chicken breasts and thighs.  I like the mix of the two together, and preparing them ahead and freezing allows me that choice.  Heavy cream is an example of a semi-pantry/freezer ingredient.  It keeps for a month in the refrigerator, and using just half a cup in smoked salmon risotto adds richness.  The rest of the ingredients for that recipe are also long keepers as well.  It\u2019s a good example of a good pantry/freezer recipe that doesn\u2019t taste like it.\n \n8.  I keep an old school 4x6 card recipe box.  It was literally this past January that I redid the organization.  Instead of \u2018Main Dishes\u2019 or \u2018Vegetables\u2019 I have now divided my recipes into specific types of foods.  Now I have only to look through the \u2018Chicken\u2019 section if chicken breasts are on sale and don\u2019t have to wade through beef, pork, fish recipes, etc.  It has been very sensible, and I wish I organized it that way years ago.  If you\u2019re interested, these are my categories:  Chicken Main Dish, Pork Main Dish, Beef Main Dish, Sausage Main Dish, Fish and Seafood Main Dish, Carbohydrate Main Dish (i.e. Scalloped Potatoes), Crock Pot Main Dish, Leftovers as Main Dish (i.e. Grandma Ginny\u2019s Casserole), Soups, Breakfast and Brunch, Carb Sides (i.e. coconut rice), Vegetable Salads, Vegetables-Misc., Fruit Salads, Hors d\u2019oeuvres, Breads and Muffins, Cookies, Cakes, Desserts, Beverages, Marinades/Sauces/Spreads, Holiday Foods, Miscellaneous.  \n\n9.  Choose how you want to spend.  Skimping, or frugality, is not righteous; it is just a decision about spending.  Meanwhile, spending extra money on a certain category isn\u2019t splurging; it is just a decision about spending.  Example:  I always buy generic pasta because I don\u2019t notice a difference.  However, I always buy Uncle Ben\u2019s brand rice because it is reliably always good and nicely formed.  We never purchase juice for ourselves because we don\u2019t want those calories for that amount of money.  However, every week we have as much as $15 worth of berries at any given day because they are so outstandingly healthy for us.  It is a choice for health.\n\nThere you have it.

{"title": "I really like to have my mise-en-place together, but I refuse to wash a bunch of tiny bowls.", "selftext": "TLDR:  I use 2 large cutting boards to stage my cooking instead of a bunch of small bowls. \n\nSo my solution is just to leave things in separate piles on the cutting board.  I have 2 large cutting boards (18 x 30 inches, 46 x 76 cm), they are big enough to straddle the sink giving me some extra workspace in my small kitchen, and one is dedicated to raw meat.  I cut these myself from a much larger commercial polyethylene board I bought on the cheap from the local restaurant supply store.  \n\nSo, I wash my veggies and then plop my board down on top of the sink.  I cut up the things I want to keep dry first because those wet veggies will get water all over my board.  This includes cheeses and breads.  I move them to the right-hand side of the board and cover them with a tea towel.  Then I get after the veggies for the side dishes. \n\nThat done, I move the entire board to the table until I am ready for it.  I plop down the meat board and chop my onions, garlic, herbs, and anything else that will cook with the meat and pile them up on the right-hand side of the board.  Then I cut up my meat whether that be cubing some steak or pork, or breaking down a chicken.  I have plenty of space, but if I need more I can transfer some of the items to platters or plates, but 90% of the time I only have three prep items to clean afterward, a knife and 2 boards. \n\nI hope this gives some of you some ideas.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mclnru/i_really_like_to_have_my_miseenplace_together_but/", "created_utc": 1616633420.0, "score": 278, "author": "withouta3", "num_comments": 50, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mclnru/i_really_like_to_have_my_miseenplace_together_but/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Julie and Julia - Art of French Cooking - POTATO SOUP", "selftext": "I think most of us have seen this movie. some girl named Julie tries to make every recipe in Julia Childs Art of French Cooking book.\n\nIve decided im going to try it. I think trying to cook something unknown, outside my comfort zone, every day, will be good practice. Ive read it starts with simple techniques and progressively gets \"harder\".\n\nFirst recipe was Potato Soup. I didn't know if i even liked potato soup, but made it anyway. It came out pretty good! Its cheap, and easy. Just potato and yellow onions. i didn't add the butter or cream.\n\npoured some in a bowl.. tasted.. it was \"flat and bland\".\n\ni got to practice salting. add a little salt to the bowl, taste. add a little salt..taste.. until i got to YUM\n\nsalt does magic!\n\nthen i added a little butter, tasted...added more butter, tasted.\n\ni wanted to see how each ingredient contributes to the flavor.\n\nthe next soup recipes, use this Potato Soup recipe as a base, so im sure i will be making it a few more times. that's more practice.\n\nThe kids even ate it, but i had to bribe them by using Funyons as croutons. see link for those outside the US.\n\n[https://www.fritolay.com/brands/funyuns](https://www.fritolay.com/brands/funyuns)\n\n**Notes:**\n\no  I first tried using a potato masher.. blah..then i used an immersion blender. So much easier and faster!\n\no  i will make 1/2 the amount.. since i will be cooking almost daily, i don't want to fill the the fridge with left overs.\n\no  I think i would like the soup to be more \"creamier\" or dense, compared to the watery consistency i previously achieved. So i will reduce the amount of water used. ***edit:*** u/gtbernstein and u/Section_Hiker ***suggested i just add cream to make it thicker! cream made this soup a million times better!***\n\no  the recipes use leek and watercress. i have no idea what they are or what they taste like. But i guess ill find out.\n\no  two dots on my induction stove, will provide me a simmer. surface of liquid is still, with a little bubble, as defined in the book.\n\no i only use the potato + onion as my base. and do flavor/salting tests in my bowl. This gives me the freedom to try out all sorts of spices in my pantry without worry of messing everything up. I like fresh ground pepper and the wife likes tarragon in it.\n\n**Things i tried from the comments**:\n\no  I added a splash of **40% heavy cream** to my bowl. wow!!! makes it ***amazing***!

But I need to use more oil than I would with my nonstick, to keep things from burning, or to flip them or to get them off the pan at the end.  \n\nI make a great hash brown dish with peppers and onions.  Using a non stick pan I can get them nice and brown, and flip them easily, and slide them off at the end no problem, all by starting with a tablespoon or two of oil.  \n\nBut using the enamel iron skillet, everything sticks before it\u2019s brown, and there\u2019s always lots of food left behind stuck to the pan - if I use the same amount of oil as the non stick strategy.  So I use more oil and everything works out - good brown, easier flip, easier finish - but now I\u2019m eating twice as much oil, right?  And that\u2019s less healthy, right?\n\nAll ideas, thoughts, corrections and advice are welcome.  \n\nLove this sub.  Thanks.\n\nEditing a week later to stumbler scrollers, using advice from this post I had a much better experience with my enamel cast iron pan by heating the pan on high heat **for four minutes**  before adding ghee/oil, heating that for 30 seconds before adding the food.  Small amount of ghee was used and food flipped and came off pan with no problem.  There was a little browsing residue left over but much less than before.  \n\nPreviously I was only heating for two minutes - which works great on nonstick but this cast iron enamel coated pan is much heavier and thicker.

But the other side to a big heavy cast iron, enamel coasted skillet heated through and through is garlic and other aromatics burn.  Obviously this crusting is what I want on my chicken, but not on the garlic.  Not a major loss, and still probably worth the dope crusting of the chicken, but I used to saut\u00e9 aromatics like garlic, ginger, even onions and mushrooms in the same pan for flavor.

{"title": "My mom taught me to make soup, I took the part I liked the least, replaced it... Even my mom AND grandma liked it.", "selftext": "Soup and Bread. 2 things that were always big things in my family. Growing up, any time of year, I could go into the kitchen and find fresh bread on the counter, and a jar of soup in the fridge. \n\nI love chicken noodle soup. Was always my fave. My mom always made it with onion and carrot. I love onions. I HATE CARROTS. For decades, I ate around the carrots. Will continue to do so. I do it without shame as carrots ARE BORING AND TASTE LIKE SWEET DIRT. \n\nI've been spending a lot of time with my parents lately, absorbing the cooking lessons I should have learned from my mom as a kid. \n\nLast week, I did my first solo batch of chicken noodle soup, but, Instead of gross boring carrots... I bought a couple of red peppers, put them on the barbecue, grilled them until their skins turned black, put them in a pot with a lid to cool, took the seeds out, peeled off most, but not all of the skins, diced them up, and put that in, at the end instead. \n\n\nCould I have just diced red pepper and cooked them they way carrots get cooked in a soup? Sure. Probably would have been fine.\n\n\nBut I learned, making salsa last month, that roasting and sweating the peppers releases the sugars, and the blackened skins add a nice smokiness. \n\n\nTaking what I learned making salsa, and applying it to the soup... maybe it was just her being proud of me... but even she said \"that is better than carrots\".\n\nMy parents went to visit my grandparents this weekend, they took 2 jars. I don't know if it's just them being nice, but my Octogenarian grandparents called and asked me to bring them a batch \"with a little less salt because of grampa's heart\" in jars for Christmas. \n\n\nAll that bullshit blog posty crap for a pretty basic recipe. Keep in mind that I'm Canadian so the units are going to be a FUCKING MESS to decode if I add them, but the beauty is: It's soup... Measurements are \"Yeah, that looks good, it's smelling good, it'll be good\". \n\nThe details:\n\n1 whole chicken, the smallest one is fine if money is tight. Get the bigger one if you want a sandwich meat side quest. If it came trussed (tied up with string), take that off. Check for an organ pack/loose neck, remove, discard. That's not anything you need at this stage. \n\nYou could also use a value pack of thigh, drumsticks, or breasts if you prefer light/dark meat or it's whatever is on sale... I'm going to keep saying this, it's soup, it doesn't matter, it'll be fine.   \n\nTake your biggest pot, 1 teaspoon of salt for every litre of water it takes to cover the chicken in whatever pot you have that it fits in. Again, this is all rough, it's soup, IT DOESN'T MATTER, if you err on the side of caution, soup forgives almost anything.  You can add salt, or soya sauce when you eat it if you're shy on salt. You can back it off with water later if you over do it. Wing it, you're going to be fine. \n\n\nThen add dry flaked onions, if you like onions, add lots, it you don't, add only a little. Add some though, just for flavour. Do what YOU THINK will taste good, and it will. We use dry onion because it's convenient and tastes great in soup. But, If you only have a fresh onion... You can use that. \n\n2-3 chicken bouillon cubes, I use Knorr, use what you have/prefer. Do you like a strong broth? Add 4 cubes. \n\nPut the bird in, bring everything to a boil, then dial it back to a simmer. \n\n\nLeave it simmering for about 2 hours. Check it every 30 mins. If part of the bird looks like it's being neglected, flip the whole bird with 2 spatulas. The bird will rise in the water as it cooks. \n\nThis is when you blacken and sweat the peppers. 2 is enough for even a big batch. Just put them over fire until the skin turns black. Barbecue is ideal/safest. But it can be done over a stove burner, under the broiler in the oven, or with a propane torch. Any way you can, char the skin, then put them in a covered dish, keep the steam in. If all that is too much, or you don't have access to any of those things... you can buy roasted red peppers in a can, they are right there in the canned vegetable aisle, if you haven't picked up on the theme here, those are just fine too. \n\n\nThe chicken is ready when you can stick forks in the breast and they easily separate, but still hold together. The drum stick bones should pull out easily. When you get there, lift the whole chicken into your largest strainer, set into your largest bowl. Let it cool. Protect from mischievous/hungry pets. \n\n\nThe broth should be on minimum heat now, free of bones. Just let it be for now. It can sit there at hot hold for hours. If it boils down because your house is dry and you ran the exhaust fan, add water, or don't, nobody has every died from salty broth. Even if you messed up so bad you're close to toxic levels of sodium, add water when you reheat it. The salt will help it keep longer. \n\n\nWhen the chicken is cool enough to handle by hand, add dry pasta to the broth, Bow ties? Elbow macaroni? Busted up spaghetti because it's what you have? Anything is fine. How much should you add? IT. DOES. NOT. MATTER. It'll be fine. Do you like lots of noodles? Add lots of noodles. Beware of mixing pasta shapes. The may not all cook to the same texture. If that's ok with you, mix away. Some will be soft, some will be al dente, it will all be safe to eat. \n\n\nThen it's time to get your hands dirty. Get 3 bowls. Strip that chicken of all it's meat. Separate the meat into one bowl for you. Put the skin, cartilage, veins, tendons etc. into another for your pets. Put the bones in the third for disposal. \n\n\nIf you want meaty soup, chop up all that chicken, dice the peppers, if you don't like smoky flavours, strip the burnt pepper skins, if you do, leave them, if you're unsure, remove half. Then just dump it back in the broth. Hoe much burnt skin? How small do you cut the chicken... DO YOU!!! I cannot reiterate how little these details matter. Do you like big chunks of meat? Leave it chunky. You like little chunks? Cut it smaller. Do you like it shredded stringy? Shred it. It's YOUR soup. Put the meat back however YOU want it. IT DOES NOT MATTER. IT'LL BE FINE. \n\nPortion it out into clean jars while hot, it's good for 2+ weeks in the fridge without further preservation. My last batch I got 6x250ml snack jars, and 3x500ml meal size jars. As well as 3 small jars of pulled chicken sandwich meat, but that is a side quest.

{"title": "Recipe for Authentic Chinese Dumplings (Jiaozi)", "selftext": "Hi r/cookingforbeginners.  Made some dumplings using a recipe my      Grandma and Dad gave me for authentic dumplings made exactly like    they   do in China. It takes awhile, but it makes A TON of dumplings    that   easily serves 6 - 8 people. Or you can freeze them and reheat    when   needed.\n\nI would recommends getting help from family and/or friends as it's much easier with multiple people. \n\n[Step by Step Instructions Here](https://youtu.be/knVNnD4SqOs)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Dough:  \n\n   * 6 Cups of Flour\n   * 1 \u2154 Cup Lukewarm Water\n* Filling:  \n\n   * 2 lbs Ground Pork\n   * 4 - 5 Napa Cabbage Leaves\n   * 1 Tbsp Minced Ginger\n   * 4 Spring Onions, Minced\n   * 1 Tbsp Salt\n   * \u2153 Cup Water\n   * \u00bc Cup Soy Sauce\n   * 1 tsp Sesame Oil\n\n**Directions:**\n\nDough\n\n1. Add the Flour and lukewarm water in a bowl.\n2. Knead it into a shaggy dough\n3. Turn      it out onto a lightly floured counter and knead for 5 - 10 mins or      until not sticking to you or the table. The motion is to PUSH the   dough,    then pull back. Not just press into the dough. We're trying to develop a gluten network through kneading and the push and pull method does the best job at this.\n4. Set it aside, covered, while preparing the filling\n\nFilling\n\n1. Chop up the Napa cabbage leaves into a fine mince, then set in a bowl and salt it. Let it sit while the prep the rest\n2. Mince up the ginger and green onions then set aside\n3. Add      ground pork to a bowl and add the salt, water, and soy sauce in   small    additions while stirring in one direction (I chose clockwise) -   this    will develop a better protein matrix that stays juicier as it   cooks. It should look stringy with visible meat strands\n4. Add the ginger, scallions, and sesame oil and stir again\n5. Wring the cabbage out dry - it should release a shocking amount of water. Then add the cabbage to the pork and stir\n\nAssembly\n\n1. Rip a chunk of dough off and lightly knead it into a flat disk\n2. Then poke a hole in the center and working your hands around the doughnut shape, stretch out the circumference of the dough\n3. Rip the dough at a point, then roll it into a log about the diameter of an adult thumb\n4. Cut or rip pieces off the dough log the size of half and adult thumb\n5. Roll those pieces into balls, then smash flat to make small disks\n6. Using      a rolling pin, roll from the edge of the disk to the center then      slightly rotate and repeat, making sure to leave the center thicker  than     the edges. This will allow more filling to be put in the  dumpling.     Repeat this till the disk is \\~3in/7.5cm\n7. Put a Tbsp of the filling in the center of the dough\n8. Press it down to remove air pockets\n9. Take the opposite ends of the dough and fold them together, Pinch em to form a seem.\n10. Using your thumb and base of your index finger, crimp/seal the edges to form the dumpling.\n11. Repeat steps 1 - 6, THEN steps 7 - 10 in batches. Doing all the dough at once will dry it out before you can fill all the disks\n\nCooking\n\n1. Bring a pot of water to a boil\n2. Stir it to form a current/whirlpool\n3. Drop the dumplings into the whirlpool\n4. Cover and lower the heat to medium\n5. Once the water starts boiling again, add some cool water and gently stir to form another whirlpool\n6. Cover the repeat step 5 two more times, or until the meat registers 165F\n7. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked dumplings from the pot and plate em up\n\nThat's     it! Again, it does take some time and is best done with others. But      this recipe makes a truly staggering amount of dumplings that last   for    multiple meals.\n\nI hope you make it and let me know how it goes!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mijyy8/recipe_for_authentic_chinese_dumplings_jiaozi/", "created_utc": 1617368731.0, "score": 261, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mijyy8/recipe_for_authentic_chinese_dumplings_jiaozi/", "html_title": ""}

Is there anyway to make this more palatable?\n\nAll I did was follow the packet and pour some hot water followed by normal temp water to fill it up to nearly a full cup.\n\nEdit 1: \n\nI've read some of the comments here and some do seem like possible solutions to my problem so I'll give them a shot and probably update on how it'll go. \n\nTo the comments saying that I could donate it to a food shelter, I can somewhat agree to the idea but at the same time I don't want the folks there to drink bad instant chocolate mixes, as well as the fact that the closest donation area is pretty far from my spot (I don't own a car so I can only commute but is commuting in an 2 hour venture just to drop off a small packet of hot chocolates worth it? Maybe on a good day, I suppose). \n\nTo another batch of the comments stating I could just throw it away, I assure you I wish I could but considering I live in an apartment complex as my aunt who LOVES to gossip (the fact there's only 6 tenants here including her shows a small group) to my mom on the weekends were to suddenly see me dropping said packs to the bin at the back...

To be honest, I don't know but it's a thing I've been pretty ingrained in me.\n\nIt's been a thing in my house, since we were pretty poor, to not waste even the single grain of rice that drop off the plate. Before discarding something, we'd usually find ways to preserve it or make it last a little bit longer so we could have some snacks or meals later on (the only time we do throw it out if it's rotten or clearly has gotten bad after the due date). Considering my meager salary and small blessings from my parents, I feel kinda bad about just throwing it away just because I don't like it. \n\nSorry about the long rant though, will consider everything you guys say and would like to say my thanks again! \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1ae9cs4/what_to_do_with_bad_hot_chocolate_mix/", "created_utc": 1706570223.0, "score": 264, "author": "Both_Pear4427", "num_comments": 183, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1ae9cs4/what_to_do_with_bad_hot_chocolate_mix/", "html_title": ""}

Side note: English isn't my first language so there will be a bunch of grammar/spelling mistakes in my writing, sorry.  \n\n\nHow I made it:  \nI bought a whole chicken, butchered it and put everything but the breasts into a big stock pot with a little oil. Once it was nice and browned I took out the chicken and added in some roughly chopped celery, leek, carrots, a whole bulb of garlic cut in half and fresh herbs; parsley, bay leaf, rosemary and thyme. I also added in some roughly ground black peppercorns. I let this simmer for 3 hours, and I skimmed the scum inbetween. I took the chicken thighs out after an hour, plucked the meat from the bones and added the bones back into the pot.  \n\n\nI then strained everything through a sieve. In a smaller soup pot with a little bit of oil I put in some cubed carrots, onion, celery and minced garlic. After this softened up I added in a couple of ladles of my broth and a bit of salt and some of the shredded chicken. When I tasted it I was SO dissapointed. I felt like it was just boring, bland, tasteless. It didn't taste of chicken at all and I couldn't really taste any of the herbs. I feel like I am doing something super simple wrong, like I'm missing one ingredient or doing one step wrong.

Just built a free mobile webapp at http://trycookin.com that provides grocery lists and unf**kupable recipe videos that use up all the food in $4 meals.\n\nI grew up an overweight kid in an overweight family that never cooked. I lost 75 pounds my junior year of high school by making chicken, rice, and frozen vegetables for myself for almost every meal. \n\nIt got the job done, but after a couple years the same meal with different starch and sauce gets super old. \n\nI wanted to make better food for cheap, but felt like recipes were too much of a pain in the ass to use regularly. I'd spend all this time browsing and making a list. Then when I actually bought everything, I always wasted a bunch of the leftovers and felt like I was wasting money.\n\nI've spent the last year trying to figure out how to make cooking good food easy and cheap enough for people to start doing it regularly.\n\nI spent months following 20-somethings around Boston grocery stores (with their permission), and watching them try to cook a bunch of different meals. My two main findings were that most people don't know exactly how their groceries turn into meals when they buy them and that on most weeknights, anything more than one-dish is daunting.\n\nAfter a couple failed prototypes, I realized that what I wanted was to walk into the store and with 1 button get a grocery list that will turn entirely into one-dish meals. That way, when I'm hungry, I have a menu of unintimidating recipes that walk me through using all my food.\n\nI had a chef friend help me make the content and set up a bit of a test kitchen out of my apartment for the step photos/videos. The first grocery lists we made are 10-12 items and turn into 3 two-portion meals that cost $4/portion. \n\nIt's just free a mobile webapp at the moment without much traction, but I'm hoping more new cooks will find it helpful.

{"title": "Resources to help me fall in love with cooking", "selftext": "EDIT: I am absolutely overwhelmed (in a good way!) by the amount of advice and resources you guys offered me! I'm literally tearing up over it now. Thank you so much to everyone that took the time to comment and I promise I will put all of it to good use. I've already started watching some of the videos recommended (Salt, Fat Acid, Heat, and listening to Samin's podcast Home Cooking, and Basics with Babish) and I'm really excited to start putting some of things I've been learning into practice in my new apartment! \n\n\n\nHi everyone! I am moving to a new apartment next week, one that will not be near a lot of restaurants and have limited delivery options. This was kind of on purpose because at 29, I feel like it's time for me to, once and for all, develop a love for cooking. \n\nI'm looking for resources, books (fiction and nonfiction), podcasts, YouTube channels, films, whatever that will help me not only be more excited about cooking, but also develop the skills necessary to love it. \n\nA bit of background: I grew up in a standard, white American household with a stay at home mom. My mom was... an ok cook, but it was obvious she hated every minute of it. This was confirmed as soon as we all moved out and she immediately started living off snacks and simple sandwiches and things. My grandma's passed away now, but I can't remember her ever cooking anything except deviled eggs. \n\nHowever, my step mom and my step sister LOVED cooking. And when I went to stay with my dad, I saw how wonderful life and food could be if you loved to cook, even though my dad's family was significantly less well off, financially. I ended up getting a degree in baking and pastry because of their influence, and I still absolutely adore baking. I love the smell of flower, and the kneading of bread, whipping up a batch of cookies, or pulling a pie out of the oven. \n\nThis does not translate to cooking. I dread the \"what's for dinner\" moment of every night, I have no ability to create something without following a recipe to the letter (thanks baking school), I find the whole thing draining and unrewarding as my food inevitably is soggy or dry or bland or overpowering or undercooked or burnt or just not good. \n\nI know this isn't how it could be, or even how it's supposed to be. And I don't want to end up like my mother and grandmother, watching the news and eating a bag of flaming hot Cheetos for dinner because the thought of preparing something for dinner is so off-putting. So please, send me things to help me now. I picked up an ebook copy of The Flavor Bible and I'm loving the beginning section before it gets to the pairings, where it talks about what makes people enjoy the food you prepare and why. A deeper look into that, across any cuisine, would be perfect! \n\nOne last thing, not terribly important but a little: I am American, grew up eating standard American, but I live in Taiwan, and all the fresh produce that I will have access to will be Asian, and things like ground beef are incredibly expensive here. So resources especially geared towards Asian cuisine is especially welcome!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mvd13p/resources_to_help_me_fall_in_love_with_cooking/", "created_utc": 1619002168.0, "score": 241, "author": "Lizardosity", "num_comments": 81, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/mvd13p/resources_to_help_me_fall_in_love_with_cooking/", "html_title": ""}

I am thinking about getting a griddle, which would allow me (theoretically) to cook 4 pancakes at the same time, saving me at least 15 min.\n\nShare your tips & recommendations\n\n-----\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f UPDATE \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f: I purchased an electric griddle and I can now cook 4 of them at a time!

{"title": "Cooking for those with no time, money, or energy", "selftext": "This one is for those who would like to eat healthier, but can't cook their way out of a paper bag.\n\nThe problem:   \nYou're 2X years old, you just got your first apart ment and you have no idea how to cook. After working long hours, you just want to roll over and sleep, but you have to eat something. You could try to make something simple, but between your lack of kitchen skills and your lack of energy it's extremely likely that you will set something on fire or forget an important step. You don't want to waste food either, both because you don't have the energy to make something else tonight and you don't have the money to buy something else tomorrow. You just want to put something quick in the microwave for a garunteed meal. \n\nSolution:   \nIt's 2019, and we now have a myriad of ways to have tech cover for a lack of time. Fake it till you make it, right?   \n\nToaster oven W timer.  \nTurns out you never needed the \" real\" oven in the first place. The key difference is that it shuts off on it's own, so you use it (almost) exactly the same way as a microwave. Here's a quick one:  \n\nBaked veggies.     \n\nYou need   \n- bag of California mix of veggies  \n\n1) put foil on pan.  \n2) put veggies on pan. You can thaw if you want, I guess, but its not necessary.   \n3) set to bake in 300- 350 for 15 mins.  \n4) pull them out and taste. If it's not to your liking, try another 5 minutes.   \n\nThe beauty of this is that once you become comfortable doing this, you can try spicing or whatever. Cuts on your energy bill too.    \n\nYou can put whatever you would have put in the oven in the toaster oven this way, with smaller portions. I've been putting fish in here, and if you use the foil to separate the food you can just do a fish/ veg/fries split and look like you know what you're doing.    \n\nThere are other things one can use \"technical assistance\" to make, like scrambled eggs in an egg cooker or quinoa in a rice cooker( some of these are entirely automatic and not only shut off when done but also keep it warm for you).   \n\nThere are some tradeoffs, though.  \n1)You give up some degree of control.  \n- this means that you lose the ability to make fine tuned decisions regarding how seared you want your green peppers, for example.   \n2) taste is not going to be as good as a well cooked meal, just an average one.  \n- yeah, no way around this. You can mitigate this with seasoning and sauces, but at the end of the day the whole reason you took your skill out of the equation is because it was having a negative impact on edibility.    \n3) Some foods cannot be made this way.  \n- basically anything involving boiled water, or large meats, some kinds of egg can't be done in an egg cooker, etc. The rice cooker mitigates this a bit, though.    \n4) Most foods take longer to make   \n- You're using less powerful equipment to do this( literally drawing less wattage for each of these, I'm pretty sure). It's not that bad because now you get to kind of just fire and forget, but it does take longer to cook.   \n\nFor those who just can't afford the time, money, energy or opportunity cost of learning how to make a meal \" the hard way\" there is, in fact, an easier way to do this.    \n\nMy equipment:. \nHamilton Beach toaster oven ( 70$ on sale, combo with).  \nHamilton Beach rice cooker/steamer ( 50$ on sale)\nDash egg cooker(20 bucks).   \nSome aluminum foil.   \nA measuring cup.  \nA meat thermometer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/bkxlr0/cooking_for_those_with_no_time_money_or_energy/", "created_utc": 1557062237.0, "score": 243, "author": "realmslayer", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/bkxlr0/cooking_for_those_with_no_time_money_or_energy/", "html_title": ""}

I have some quite bad chronic health issues that result in me only being able to eat a handful of different things, and quail eggs are one of the few foods that actually make me feel better and not worse, so I'm extremely reluctant to stop eating them.\n\nMy only problem is that recently my chronic anxiety has been extremely bad and every single day over the past few weeks, I've been having literal anxiety attacks over the thought of them giving me food poisoning.\nQuail eggs are specialty eggs, so when you buy them at the store they'll still be dirty and have little bits of crud on them; so I've been dipping them in warm water right before boiling them to clean them off and at the same time I do a float test to make sure they're still fresh (fresh eggs sink, old eggs float). But I'm noticing more and more hairline cracks on my eggs; really tiny ones that are extremely hard to see.\nI've had to start meticulously checking every single egg for hairline cracks after cleaning them, and I feel like I'm going a bit insane.

{"title": "Authentic Chinese Scallion Pancake Recipe (Only 5 Ingredients)", "selftext": "Hi r/cookingforbeginners.  Here\u2019s a recipe for authentic Chinese scallion pancakes. My Grandma has been making these for my entire life and recently showed me how she does it. Wanted to share the recipe with you all as it\u2019s super simple and can be filled like any flatbread with a myriad of things like eggs, beef, pickles, etc. Below is a video of me making it, if that\u2019s easier to follow along with:\n\n[Take a look here if interested](https://youtu.be/NUyurWRemRw)\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 \u00be Cup Flour\n* \u00be Cup Water\n* 1 tsp Salt\n* 3 Green Onions/Scallions\n* Oil\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Add Flour, Salt, and Water in a bowl and mix until a shaggy dough forms\n2. Turn that dough out onto a work surface and knead for 5 - 10 mins, or until it looks smooth\n   1. The motions should be to push the dough outward, then pull it back; rotate the ball of dough periodically and repeat the push/pull.\n3. Cover the dough and let it relax for 5 - 10 mins\n4. Slice Up the scallions into thin rings and set aside\n5. Flour the work surface and roll out the dough into a rectangle-ish shape about \u215b inch thick\n6. Drizzle oil on the dough and smear it all over the the surface so there are no dry spots\n7. Sprinkle the sliced scallions all over the oiled dough\n8. Roll up the dough into a long snake\n9. Seal the edges by pinching them and tucking under the roll\n10. Cut the snake in half and seal the cut edge like you did in step 9\n11. Take one of the halves and gently pull it while banging it on the table. Don\u2019t have to be too rough, just stretch out the roll a bit\n12. Coil up the roll then tuck the edge under the coil\n13. Flatten the disk by rolling it out again, feel free to flip and rotate the disk as you roll it out. Some scallions will poke through, and this is ok\n14. Preheat a pan on medium heat with just a bit of oil. Take some paper towels and spread the oil around the pan like you are trying to clean it\n15. Once the oil starts smoking a bit, lower the heat to medium low and add the pancake\n16. Cook for 2 mins then flip it over\n17. Keep cooking for 2 mins then flipping the pancake until you get some dark brown spots, like a leopard\n18. Once you get those spots on both sides, you\u2019re done! Cut it up and enjoy!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or how it turned out for you if you made it.

{"title": "What are your favourite relatively simple dishes to make?", "selftext": "Hi I am  in a position where I really need to learn how to cook for myself now. I've found an issue I run into a lot is that I just don't know what I should try to cook and then I decide it's too overwhelming to make a choice and just get McDonald's. So I thought i would ask what some of your favourites are in the hope that hearing some nice dishes that don't sound too hard to cook will give me and anyone who has the same issue more of a direction to start in.\n\nEdit: a bit on what foods I like in case that is helpful  I don't really like spicy food so more mild things. I don't think about what food I actually like that much, honestly the only qualifier is that I can't handle loads of spice but a little is ok. My mum taught me how to make a carbonara sauce recently and I really liked that, so that's something quite creamy. My sister does this rice dish with soy sauce and vegetables (I'm not sure if it is technically stir fry but I think it is like that) which I like so that's pretty generic description and I'm not sure if it's helpful but it is there.\n\nAlso to try and clarify a bit more on simple: By simple I mean not too complicated or technical, I could take a bit of a challenge because I need to learn but I am still a beginner with very little experience actually cooking", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/o5ixed/what_are_your_favourite_relatively_simple_dishes/", "created_utc": 1624354070.0, "score": 229, "author": "KrackalackinKraken", "num_comments": 111, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/o5ixed/what_are_your_favourite_relatively_simple_dishes/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "No soak beans: beans from dry to fully cooked in under two hours.", "selftext": "Dry beans soak up water to become edible. When you pre-soak them, they soak up some amount of water, and then you cook them the rest of the way to finish preparing them.\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t have time to soak them? No problem!\n\nYou can cook the beans from scratch by applying enough heat for a long enough period of time.\n\nI usually start with one cup (or half a bag) of dry beans, usually black or pinto. Rinse them off completely for about two minutes to make sure they\u2019re clean (and no debris or rocks are in them).\n\nPut them in a pot, add a tablespoon or less of salt, cover with water (by at least two inches), and turn on the heat. Get it to a rolling boil. Stir it every 20 minutes or so for the first hour.\n\nOnce an hour is up, stir it more frequently, every 5 to 10 minutes. Taste a bean every time you stir. They will go from hard to aldente to cooked in a fairly short period of time. I also tend to add a pinch of salt every time I taste until the flavor is just right as opposed to salting at the end (it tastes better if you salt it slightly as you go). Add water if the water level gets too low.\n\nYour beans will be done and perfect before you hit the two hour mark!\n\nBut why is this method never discussed? Why does everyone say you need to soak them first?\n\nBasically, it\u2019s an optimization curve. If you use this method, they are less likely to cook consistently. So some beans may be perfect while some beans may be al dente.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t soak the beans but cook at a lower heat, it will cook more consistently (good) but it will take longer to cook (bad).\n\nIf you cook at a higher heat, it will cook faster (good) but it can cook more inconsistently (bad). One way to help mitigate this is to leave the beans partially covered while they cook so the temperature can be turned down some (so it won\u2019t have to be a rolling boil but can still take a similar amount of time). Additionally, you will need to monitor and stir them more if you don\u2019t soak them.\n\nIf you pre soak them, then you can cook them over a lower heat. This will take longer (bad) but they\u2019ll cook more consistently (good). Furthermore, they will need less attendance monitoring by you; you can stir them less frequently when the heat is lower and you\u2019ve pre soaked them (also good).\n\nSo there you have it. Beans from shelf to dinner plate in under two hours. Just understand that yes, there are trade offs. But I personally haven\u2019t been bothered by the trade offs and I\u2019ve gotten good at getting them to the proper consistency. So I no longer need to soak them.\n\n**Bonus tip: The quick-soak method.** Put the beans in a pot, cover them by a couple of inches of cold water, bring the pot to boil. Once it\u2019s boiling, stir them, put the lid on the pot and remove it from heat. Let them sit there for a couple hours and this will have a similar effect to soaking from dry (with no heat) for several hours.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kfn6pe/no_soak_beans_beans_from_dry_to_fully_cooked_in/", "created_utc": 1608305376.0, "score": 227, "author": "None", "num_comments": 67, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kfn6pe/no_soak_beans_beans_from_dry_to_fully_cooked_in/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "When All You Have is Maple Syrup", "selftext": "Maple Candy\n\n(The reason why i consider this to be easy, is because you only need one food ingredient. And i myself am an amateur cook. The entire process is mainly boiling and stirring, in a nutshell that is. Having said that, if you feel like this recipe doesnt belong here, let me know.)\n\nFor all you \u2018Friends\u2019 fans. Be sure to read all of this before making.\n\n1. Get a digital thermometer. The temperature needs to be as precise as possible.\n2. Get a cooking pot with high sides (a large spaghetti or stew pot).\n3. Get 100% pure organic maple syrup. 2 cups worth. No sugars or salts or any additives. Maple syrup should be the only ingredient.\n4. Get a whisk (or whatever you\u2019d prefer to stir with. Whisk always felt easier to me.)\n5. Get molds, a cupcake tin, or something to pour the finished product into to let it cool. \n5. Warm water for cleanup. The warmer the better. Its gonna seem like a sticky mess, but maple syrup does not like to be soaked in warm water.\n\n(Here\u2019s how to)\n\nPut two cups of maple syrup in the pot. \n\nBoil over medium or high heat. Stir occasionally. \n\nAs soon as its starts frothing and bubbling, check the temperature every few minutes using the thermometer.\n\nAs soon as it gets to 110 degrees celsius, immediately take it off the heat.\n\nContinue checking the temperature until it lowers to 80 degrees celsius.\n\nAs soon as it gets to 80 degrees celsius, stir the heck out of it. Quickly and assertively. The dark color of the syrup will slowly (very slowly), start to get lighter and lighter.\n\nOnce it reaches a bright gold color, immediately pour it into a mold/cupcake tin/vessel of your choice.\n\nNow, walk away, and let it cool at room temperature. I normally come back to it after about an hour. The more cool it is, the better.\n\nWhen its cool and hardened, pop it out of the molds or cupcake tin and eat it! If you poured it out into something like a casserole dish, then id recommend using a spatula to break it into pieces. It wont look as nice, but it\u2019ll still be edible.\n\nNotes:\n\nDo not leave the kitchen at all while doing this. It\u2019s way too easy for it to boil over, and you need to be on standby for when it reaches the desired temperatures. \n\nDo not cover at all during the entire cooking process.\n\nWhen it starts to boil, it bubbles immensely and can easily boil over. This is why a pot with high sides is necessary. \n\nMaple candy is extremely sweet. Many people will not like that. You are literally eating a chunk of maple syrup. It\u2019s supposed to be a little chewy and crumbly, but not hard like rock candy.\n\nI normally store the candy in a closed container in the fridge.\n\nThe temperature of your kitchen is also a factor. I personally dont have AC in my kitchen. I know from experience that if its up to 75 degrees fahrenheit  in my kitchen, then the candy probably wont cool correctly, if at all.\n\nThis process will test your patience....but most of all, your self esteem. The first time i made this, it came out perfect. Second time i made this, it wouldnt cool at all. Third time, i nearly got it right, with half of it cooling, and the other half a runny mess. Sometimes i get it right, other times i have to start over with new maple syrup.\n\nMaybe the room isnt the right temperature, maybe the boiling process was too hot or too cold, maybe it was under-stirred. There are too many things (some of which not within your control) that could mess it up. Dont be discouraged. Its worth it to try again. At the very least, your kitchen will smell amazing!\n\nIf this is allowed, here\u2019s a link that i frequently use to help keep me on track during the process. Just scroll halfway down the page until you see the video, for a visual. As great as this video is, it doesnt tell you a lot of little details you\u2019d need. \n\nhttps://littlehouseontheprairie.com/diy-maple-sugar-candy/\n\nOnce again, i can take this recipe off this reddit, if you guys feel it isnt simple enough.

I want to open up a restaurant. A spot to call my own and have friends & family invited over to enjoy, and be in the presence of others enjoying something we all have in common... good food & drinks. So becoming a good cook is a great entry way into that because it will give me another avenue to understand food. And also respect myself to know at least some ground level of cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR I want to learn to cook and need recommendations on starting classes online.

{"title": "I want to photosynthesize instead...", "selftext": "To start off, I have a problem with food. As someone who has ADD, I find the task of preparing and cooking food an absolute chore and (maybe) because of that, I'm extremely turned off of eating. Shopping for a handful of items can take upwards to an hour because I'm not sure what I should get. I hate recipes, however I can follow them perfectly but the time it takes me to make it I'm no longer hungry and if I'm making food without a recipe, it's like asking a toddler to make dinner. Thankfully my SO is a great cook however they shouldn't be my mom and cook every night. \n\nThe main question here is is there a type of diet or something along those lines that requires minimal prep and little cooking? My goal is akin to snacking throughout the day as opposed to cooking meals. Like eating carrot sticks and raw tomatoes with cheese. My main issue is nutrition. I am somewhat knowledgeable about vitamins but the more I think about what food combinations I should eat to meet this quota, the more my brain wants to abandon the Idea of food altogether making me hate it. Why can't I photosynthesize.\n\n\nTl:Dr cooking is a chore, I make food taste as good as a toddler would, need little to no cook snack style foods. (Please no meat suggestions. Trout, beef heart, chicken gizzards, duck eggs are my preferred protein.)\n\nEdit: no processed or premade/precooked food please \n\nEdit 2: I greatly appreciate all the feedback and you've given me great ideas. As per those that think this is an absurd request, I suppose. However, I'm grasping at straws to figure out what to do. I want to learn how to manage my issues and be independent.

Or so I thought..\n\nEdit: For those who want it, here's a rough recipe for this cheesy meatballs (I just eyeballed the amounts and keep changing things each time I make it lol).\n\n1 packet of minced turkey.\nAbout 2x big cloves of garlic.\n3x tablespoons big oats (more if the mix seems too wet).\n1 egg to bind (optional).\nSalt and pepper if preferred.\n\nFor this version:\n1x slice Gouda cheese. (Its what I had in fridge. But I guess you can use really small cubes of your cheese of choice).\nEnough Dukkah mix to cover a small plate (I googled for a recipe I liked).\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nBeat the egg in a mixing bowl. Rip the cheese in half, then into small strips. Add the turkey mince, oats, garlic, and seasoning if using. I like to use my hands, but I guess you can mix it with whatever you like. Scoop out a small amount, flatten in palm, add 1 strip of the cheese, folded, and mold the mince to cover it. Roll around in palms until it forms a ball. Keep going until its all used up. Roll the balls in the Dukkah mix.\n\n\nLine a baking tray with foil. Pour with some olive oil, make sure it covers all the bottom. Put the meatballs in tray. Brush some oil over them. Bake around 160\u00b0 for 20 mins. Switch in the grill (or broil?) For another 5 mins to give them abut of colour. Et voila! (This works if they are about the size of truffles. Maybe leave in another 10 mins if they're huge).\n\nI highly recommend making these plain and adding to a tomato sauce spaghetti dish.

{"title": "I made a natural energy drink!", "selftext": "I finetuned and tasted the recipe at midnight while tired, it's now 2AM and I'm still wired, so it definitely works. It's also delicious. \n\n#Recipe bit\n\nIngredients!  \n1. Watermelon for juice  \n2. Ginger for syrup, I used around 300g but have a lot left over.  \n3. Green tea - most are caffeinated, but double check.  \n4. Fresh lime/lemon for juice, I used 6 of each.  \n5. Sugar for syrup  \n6. Water for syrup  \n7. Club soda for fizz\n\nTo make one glass, simply combine:  \n100mL green tea  \n75mL watermelon juice  \n30mL lemon/lime juice  \n40mL ginger syrup  \n20mL simple syrup  \n150mL club soda.\n\nMake sure you add the soda last or it loses its fizz.\n\n#Chatty bit\n\nI bought a whole watermelon, but only juiced half of it, and still have watermelon juice left over, so word to the wise. Plan to eat watermelon.\n\nFirst I made simple syrup and ginger syrup. These are things I like to have around anyway, so I made too much. In case you don't know how to make syrups, here's how.\n\nSimple syrup:\n\nCombine equal parts sugar and filtered water in a saucepan. Add a little more sugar if you feel like it. Or a lot if you feel like it. \nStir to combine then heat. When the water is just shy of boiling, it will go totally clear as the rest of the sugar dissolves into the water, and you can take it off the heat and let it cool. That's simple syrup - essentially liquid sugar.\n\nGinger syrup:\n\nPeel and finely chop your ginger. Combine with equal parts sugar and water. Add a little or a lot more sugar. Stir to combine.  \nBring to a simmer and keep it there for around 15 minutes to infuse the syrup with ginger flavour. Stir to keep ginger and sugar from sticking to the pan. Let it cool, then pour through a sieve to remove the ginger. You now have ginger syrup.\n\nBonus - dry out the ginger you used, it's delicious.\n\n[Picture of me making my syrups](https://i.imgur.com/qK8bOrC.jpg) \n\n[Picture of the finished syrups](https://i.imgur.com/umrDihx.jpg) \n\nAfter that I juiced my watermelon, lemons, and limes and made tea. I oversteeped the tea to make up for the dilution of the soda water later - three teabags per litre is my rule of thumb.\n\nThen combine and enjoy! I after finding the right mix of ingredients I scaled up by ten, excluding the soda, and popped it in my fridge. \n\nIt works on the caffeine from the tea, the sucrose from the syrups, and fructose from the fruits. Those sugars burn at different speeds so you get a more even energy, not a spike and crash. \n\n[Picture of my bottle of energy drink!](https://i.imgur.com/zi2SBgD.jpg) Not mixed with the soda yet, so it keeps its fizz.

{"title": "Eventually, you might want to take pictures of the food you make. Let's talk about how to take a nice food pic.", "selftext": "I am no photographer nor a professional chef, however, I was an assistant manager under a Michelin star chef and ran the restaurant's social media, and so he taught me a bit about how to make the food look good.  Here are some things he taught me.\n\n* First of all, keep in mind that you are taking a picture of the food, not the plate, not the table, not the pile of laundry on the floor on the other side of the table.  You want the food to take up as much of the frame as possible.  Get close or zoom in and turn your phone horizontal.  \n* Have good lighting.  There is a reason Kenji takes his dishes to that same window at the end of each cook.  That is where he has the best lighting.  You want to capture the details and true colors.\n* Wet food looks better.  Sometimes it takes a moment to set up a plate and the surface of the food starts to dry.  Sauces can get a skin and fat in a soup can rise to the surface.  Be sure to either stir up rice or veggies and spoon some fresh sauce over meats to get that sheen.  \n* Meat should be sliced.  Show that perfect medium-rare cook, that smoke ring, those juices oozing out that succulent dish.  Show that tender flaky fish.  \n* Take a picture from an angle.  Top-down loses depth and side-on hides most of the dish.  Also, when you sit down to eat a dish, you see the food at an angle and that is what you want your picture to make the viewer think of, sitting down to eat your dish. \n* Do not take a picture after you have taken a bite.  Nobody wants to eat after you. \n\n What it boils down to is that you want the viewer to want your dish.  show it in its best light.  Here are some examples from ten years ago, before I had a decent camera, but even still you should be able to see the difference.   I couldn't keep the pics from the restaurant, so these are meals I cooked.  \n\n[Focus on food](https://imgur.com/a/Tgl89K3)\n\n[Bad lighting](https://imgur.com/a/sEafLWq)\n\n[Bad lighting 2](https://imgur.com/a/WOleIaC)\n\n[Whole vs sliced meat](https://imgur.com/a/lXBEB4E) \n\n[Top-down vs angle](https://imgur.com/a/Uws6UKY)\n\n[Top-down 2](https://imgur.com/a/5rn6ZCH)\n\n[Some of my favorites](https://imgur.com/a/2OeRUuB)\n\nAnybody else got any tips?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/pmhn39/eventually_you_might_want_to_take_pictures_of_the/", "created_utc": 1631402416.0, "score": 210, "author": "withouta3", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/pmhn39/eventually_you_might_want_to_take_pictures_of_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

How do you safely transport it home from the store in the summer? Say you grab the chicken from the store and say by the time you check out and get home it takes you 20-30 minutes of it sitting in a bag (insulted or not) with warmer temps in the 90s is that a risk?\n2. The way I would have to cook it currently is breaded, say you're dredging the chicken in flour and flour gets in the air that's touched the chicken, wouldn't that contaminate your whole kitchen (this one is an irrational fear, but I wanted to ask).\n3. I have limited counter space for prepping the chicken, and I use a folding table to prep food. Can I put down a large silicone baking mat and cook/cut on it? Or would it be best to use individual cutting boards? Are there any tools you suggest I get to help with cooking chicken? I'll be cooking it in an air fryer.\n4.

{"title": "I'm discouraged", "selftext": "Although I make some really tasty dishes, most of the time when I try to create a new dish - the dish comes out awfully mediocre. A few days ago I tried to create a local traditional dessert my grandmother used to make. She made it amazing, best one ever. The ones I've tried by other people in the last decade don't even come close.\n\nSo I figured, why not recreate it? I can make it as good as hers, right? Wrong. It's called halvas (\u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03b2\u03ac\u03c2) and it's made with sugar, water, canola oil, cinnamon and semolina. You can add almonds, orange zest etc. \n\nYou toast the semolina, the longer you toast it the darker and more fragrant it becomes. In my first try I didn't toast it enough, so it became slightly creamy instead of slightly grainy (as it should), and had a light color instead of a dark one.\n\nIt was fine enough, but not as aromatic, and too sweet. And although fine on its own, nothing like my grandma's. So today I tried again. Now I put less sugar, and I toasted the semolina a really long time. It became dark brown and really really aromatic. So I was happy; I was sure I recreated it correctly this time. It smelled amazing, just like hers. \n\nWhen I took it out of the silicone form... It tasted weird. I think I became inpatient when I was toasting the semolina and I burned it a little. \n\nI'm so discouraged. I'm no beginner, I have been cooking for 15 years, but I still don't have much experience. Especially in baking. I just feel like I'm a mediocre/bad cook and that I don't have it in me: if I need so many tries to get something good enough and that most of the recipes I try turn out mediocre.

{"title": "Dry toasting oats over a burner", "selftext": "Hi all, for some years I've been dry toasting 500g of rolled oats each week on an aluminium nonstick pan over a stove at low heat, I just stir them every 2 or 3 minutes and cook them for about 10 minutes. Recently I decided to move away from nonstick and bought a carbon steel pan that's still unseasoned. Meanwhile I decided to try toasting my oats on a stainless steel pot that I mainly use to boil beans. It's just an old medium-sized pot, nothing fancy, no aluminium layer or stuff. I put it over my smallest burner at lowest heat and even during the first minute if I stopped stirring for about 20 seconds, it would began to burn at the bottom. I mean awfully burn with black crusts over some spots. Probably heat distribution was too irregular and I should have been stirring non-stop, but anyway I decided it's a non-starter for me. Do you think I may have better luck with the carbon steel 3mm-thick pan once seasoned? Or perhaps a layered stainless steel pan? I don't want to turn on the oven for this nor to own so many pans. I was happy with my old procedure and I would like to approximate it while staying away from nonstick, if possible. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: today I attempted this again on a SS pan with a 3-layer bottom and the experience was much better. No burn nor crust but a nice toasting.

{"title": "Best cooking apps I\u2019ve tried, Here\u2019s my list & why they stand out", "selftext": "After trying a ton of cooking recipe apps, I\u2019ve narrowed down the ones that really stood out to me. These apps do a fantastic job at recipe importing, meal planning, and helping organize everything in a way that\u2019s intuitive and user-friendly. Whether you're looking for something free or willing to pay for extra features, here\u2019s my list of the best cooking apps to compare:\n\n1. **Cooklang (Free)** Cooklang is a fantastic option if you like to keep things simple and organized with a text-based system. It's designed to store recipes in a clean, easy-to-read format, which can be helpful for meal planning without needing to mess around with complicated apps. You can easily track ingredients and keep everything in one place without feeling overwhelmed\n2. **Paprika (Paid)** Paprika has been a go-to for many home cooks for years. It\u2019s great for organizing recipes, creating shopping lists, and planning meals. The recipe import feature works well, and while it\u2019s not free, it\u2019s worth the investment for its solid, reliable features and user interface\n3. **Deglaze (Free)**  This app is a great free option for people who need simplicity and ease. It does an excellent job at importing recipes and organizing them without overwhelming you with unnecessary features. The clean interface makes meal planning and shopping a breeze, making it a great option if you don\u2019t want to pay for an app\n4. **Spillt (Free)** Spillt is fantastic if you're looking for a free app with a focus on using what you already have. It helps you cook from your pantry, suggesting recipes based on what\u2019s in your fridge. It\u2019s a perfect option for reducing food waste, and the recipe suggestions are actually really solid\n5. **ReciMe (Paid)** ReciMe is great if you want something that combines organization with meal tracking. It lets you save recipes, plan meals, and even automatically generate shopping lists. The paid version offers additional features like nutrition tracking, which makes it ideal for anyone who wants to stick to a specific diet or meal plan\n6. **Yummly (Free, with premium option)** Yummly is another widely-used app that\u2019s great for finding new recipes based on your taste preferences, dietary needs, and even ingredients you already have. It\u2019s free to use, but you can upgrade to the premium version for extra features like advanced filtering and grocery delivery integrations.\n7. **BigOven (Free, with premium option)** BigOven is a solid app that allows you to save recipes, create meal plans, and generate grocery lists. It\u2019s a popular choice due to its huge database of recipes and ease of use. The free version gives you plenty of options, but if you want to unlock more advanced features, the premium version is worth checking out.\n\nThese apps each bring something unique to the table, whether it\u2019s ease of use, recipe organization, or meal planning tools. I recommend trying a few out to see which one fits best with your cooking style and needs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jqhjvn/best_cooking_apps_ive_tried_heres_my_list_why/", "created_utc": 1743684535.0, "score": 56, "author": "Kakunabe", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jqhjvn/best_cooking_apps_ive_tried_heres_my_list_why/", "html_title": ""}

Which is weird because I\u2019ve already gotten a nice crust-doneness balance consistently using non-stick (Cold Sear) and stainless steel (waiting until the pan is hot enough, using the Leidenfrost Effect Test)\n\nSo far I\u2019ve been doing the following (sometimes individually, sometimes as a combination)\n\n- Patting with paper towels (sometimes forcefully enough like squeezing the meat)\n\n- Dry brining for at least 8 hours. Left uncovered in the refrigerator \n\n- Salting right before cooking\n\n- Pre heating the pan (10 mins low, 10 mins medium, 10 mins high) and testing using a splash of water (sizzles really fast, haven\u2019t had Leidenfrost effect unlike with stainless steel. Maybe this is a cast iron thing?)\n\n- Slabs are usually 1.5 inches thick\n\n- And of course the usual high smoke point oil (grape seed or avocado), waiting until the oil starts to ripple\n\nBut despite all those above, the steaks still seem to usually end up light brown on the outside but medium rare or medium or medium well inside. Or if I just keep it on until I get the crusting I want, the inside is usually well done. Each time the steak comes out light or medium brown I start to hate cast iron pans a little bit more because I keep on reading about how people tend to swear by cast iron when searing steaks. At least it\u2019s good for cooking bacon and eggs, but somehow, I really have problems searing a steak on cast iron\n\nSo I figure this must really be a moisture issue, and which is why I\u2019m looking for other hacks when it comes to drying the surface of the steak before searing\n\n(I just bought an IR thermometer and I\u2019m going to use it the next time I sear a steak, hopefully it helps. Otherwise I feel like giving up on cast iron cooking for steaks, still probably going to use it for bacon and eggs, and maybe some baking if I get to it)\n\n(edit: added steak thickness)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jowoqo/steak_surface_moisture_when_searing_on_a_cast/", "created_utc": 1743517034.0, "score": 5, "author": "Numerous-Ring-6313", "num_comments": 49, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jowoqo/steak_surface_moisture_when_searing_on_a_cast/", "html_title": ""}

I know I need to learn at some point, though.\n\nI guess I am looking for both dead-simple, beginner- (and depression-) friendly, quick recipes (especially if I can make it in bulk and take it to work), and just ways of developing the mental barrier in my head about cooking.

When it was all finished cooking the instructions said to use an immersion blender and blend up as much of the celery root to make it thick and creamy as I wanted.\n\nMy Mom had an immersion blender already, it's probably 20 years old, and hardly used. When I went to use it this was my first time holding an immersion blender. The button was fairly hard to press and hold, and then the blender seemed to almost pull my hand around and move around the pot.

I want to buy a new one, but not if it will just be the same.\n\nWhen I was using my Mom's, even when I had it more under control, I just wanted the experiences to be over, and I even stopped a little early.

{"title": "General tips (aka stuff I had to find out the hard way)", "selftext": "-Read through a recipe before starting it. You probably know this, but just in case. You don't want to be like me, halfway through a stir fry before I realised I don't have any eggs and whatnot. Make sure you have the necessary equipment and ingredients, and make sure you have ENOUGH of the ingredients. Whip out the weighing scale if you have to.\n\n-You probably will take way longer to make the thing than the recipe estimates, ESPECIALLY if it's your first time making that recipe. Don't be surprised. \n\n-Prep all the ingredients first. The recipe may say to cut the vegetables while the pan is heating or whatever, but especially if you're a beginner you'll be way less stressed when you do things one step at a time.\n\n-Cooking can really drain the life out of you, even if it's not a particularly strenuous recipe. Try not to start cooking when you're already hungry. Have a glass of water in reach. I like to have a chair nearby, so I can occasionally sit down if I have to. If you notice you're getting really hungry, set everything down and get yourself a snack first. Have someone else do it for you if possible, lol.\n\n-I find it easier when I have a radio or a podcast or a video on. Just any form of entertainment, basically. Otherwise you might get pissed off very quickly. \n\n-If you mess up, step away for a few minutes. Drink some water, cool off, then go back and see if you can fix it. Most of the time, you can. \n\n-When you're done cooking and the sink is now full of dirty dishes and you're tired and hungry and totally over it. The dishes can wait, they're not running away. Eat and rest first, you'll feel much better. \n\n-Before you eat, step away for a few minutes. Go to another room or to the window, just get some different air. With your nose full of the food smell and all, you'll be sick of the food before you've even started eating. Get some fresh air in your system and you'll be able to enjoy your food properly.\n\nThat's all I can think of right now :) Hope it's helpful!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jh6cxs/general_tips_aka_stuff_i_had_to_find_out_the_hard/", "created_utc": 1742642896.0, "score": 88, "author": "WallEWonks", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jh6cxs/general_tips_aka_stuff_i_had_to_find_out_the_hard/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Best mushrooms for soup broth?", "selftext": "So I like to make my own soup from scratch, and I like the flavor of mushrooms but the actual texture makes them almost inedible to me. Anyways I'm planning on making another soup and make my own broth by boiling chicken bones spices and some veggies. Is there a mushroom that might be best for this purpose? I've used shiitake mushrooms in the past and it was good, I guess I'm just wondering if anyone thinks there's a better option out there for me to try or if I should just get whatever is fresh and cheap?\n\nFor anyone wondering about my soup details, I start by saving up old chicken bones from previous meals. Typically a yummy and saucy \"Hot Portuguese\" rotisserie chicken from Superstore (but using a whole raw chicken instead works as well). I'll save the meat from one chicken to add into the soup at the end and have 1 or 2 carcasses saved in the freezer. Boil the all bones in a huge pot of water with some onions or leeks, mushrooms, I tried using an orange a couple times, basically whatever veggie waste I might have, plus lots of garlic and add my favorite spices like salt pepper garlic paprika cinnamon and basil. Let that simmer until it's reduced a good amount, then add some more water and let it continue to simmer longer again. This part can easily take 4+ hours.\n\nOnce that is done I strain it so I have just the broth itself left over and get it back up to a slight boil as I add lots of cauliflower, sliced carrots, diced regular(I preferyellow)&sweet potatoes, diced onions, and tofu that I either dice into cubes or shred by hand, and lots of honey with a bit of hot sauce and worstershire sauce. Sometimes some butternut squash. Once the veggies are cooked I throw in the hand shredded chicken and a can of corn. I also try to salvage the garlic from the broth making or might just dice up some extra garlic.\n\nYou can then eat it as is, or put some in a seperate pot and add some coconut milk to it. If you don't add too much veggies you can add your favorite noodles separately to prevent them getting mushy on reheats, I'm a fan of rice noodles.

{"title": "You can eat Japanese curry rice everyday if you make it using curry powder. Costs just 50 cents for 5 servings.

And I guarantee you it tastes just as good as the Golden Curry brand.\n\nYou can buy curry powder from Ebay. I buy Regal curry, 5 pound jar.

It costs around $30 to $40.\n* half tsp ginger powder\n* half tsp cumin powder\n* half tsp turmeric powder\n* 4 cup water\n* 1 tsp sugar\n* 1 and half tsp Knorr chicken bouillon powder (You can buy this from Ebay too. Costs $9 for 2 lbs)\n* 4 slices serrano or jalapeno pepper optional if you like spicy\n* 1/4 medium onion\n* 1 garlic\n* 2 medium potatos diced\n* 1 of the 8 inch carrot diced\n* 1/4 cup flour\n* 1 chicken leg diced\n* 1 cup of string beans or sliced celery or bell pepper\n\nInstructions: Cook chicken, potato, and carrot in 2 cups of water in a pot for 15 minutes. Then blend onion, jalapeno pepper, flour, and garlic in a blender with 2 cups of water. Pour the 2 cups of water from blender into the pot. Add the curry powder, spices, sugar, chicken bouillon powder and string beans into pot and boil another 8 minutes. Stir while boiling at the end.

{"title": "Leaving Raw Chicken and cooked onions Mixed Together in the Fridge in an Emergency", "selftext": "Hi all, hope everyone is well. So last night, I was making chicken Biryani, which I am quite experienced making, and after frying the onions, garlic and ginger, I added the raw chicken in, along with a load of other spices, all in the pot, only for my electric stove to just completely stop working. There is absolutely no power coming to it at all. I checked all the other electricals in my house, and they were and still are working completely fine, so the problem is particularly with the stove itself. I tried everything: from resetting the cooker switch at the kitchen wall to  resetting the fuse board, nothing, so, not knowing what else to do, I just put the mixture in the fridge for the night. Now I just have to wait for a technician to look at this next week as it's under warranty. However, I now fear that I will have to dispose of my partially-cooked food, as the raw chicken has now contaminated the cooked onions. I have put the mixture in the fridge for now, in case there is any way around this... I mean, I have previously seasoned raw chicken with raw onions before, then cooked it: a common practice of intensionally cross-contaminating, then cooking both meat and veg which cancels the contamination out due to the high cooking  temperatures. But given that in this case, the onions had already been cooked, and both raw chicken and cooked onions have been exposed to each other over a prolonged amount of time and at low temperatures (in the fridge), I'm not sure the same principle still applies...

We live together, so I use all the same utensils, soap, cooking appliances, etc. and never have this problem. He uses significantly less seasoning (I use a crap ton) than me, but none of the things we make taste like soap without seasoning. Chicken is the biggest problem. \n\nI thought maybe it\u2019s cause I\u2019ve gotten too used to the way I do chicken, which is a bunch of cumin and colorau (idk the English translation, but it\u2019s like paprika with annatto or sometimes called sweet pepper or something) with dashes of salt, garlic and/or onion powder, paprika, cayenne, soaked in olive oil. His chicken is always pretty white, while mine is bright orange, so that seemed possible at first. The problem with that theory is that I can eat chicken literally anywhere else and it never tastes like soap regardless of seasoning, including my mom\u2019s who also uses mostly the same stuff.\n\nHe uses the same seasonings (except colorau cause he forgets), but just significantly less.

Then, add 2 tbsp of butter, 1 tbsp of soy sauce, and 1 tbsp of mirin.\n\n\u2705 start rice cooker.\n\n**I used 1 lb of boneless skinless chicken breast cutlets, basically just breasts cut into tender sized strips**\n\n\u2705 salt & pepper the chicken & rub in garlic paste and siracha sauce (substitute with/add teriyaki, hoisin, gochujang or whatever sauce and spices you think tastes good on chicken) and distribute chicken evenly in the steamer basket.\n\n\u2705 in the middle of cooking the rice, put the steamer basket/chicken into the rice cooker for 10 minutes. Opening and closing the lid while in operation is fine, just don't leave it open unnecessarily long.\n\n**In my case the chicken temped 168, so I will probably do 8 minutes next time.**\n\n\u2705 cut the chicken into bite size pieces and set it aside.\n\n\u2705 when rice is done, add 2 more tbsp butter & 1/2 Cup of frozen corn (could also add peas and carrots) on top of the rice, and the diced chicken on top on the corn and close the lid.\n\n\u2705 after 5 min, stir everything up and serve with soy sauce. (serves 4, about 575 calories per serving if prepared as directed)\n\nI eat one portion on the spot and the other three will each fill a 16oz leftover container. When reheating, I add 2oz of chicken stock and microwave on high for 1 min, then stir and add soy sauce, and microwave for another 1 min.

{"title": "Stainless steel troubleshooting", "selftext": "Tonight I made boneless skinless chicken breast. I had been reading about how my stainless steel should be my favorite pan (Wolfgang puck bistro 11\" chicken fryer 18-20 stainless steel). \n\nAn hour before I cooked it, I dry brined the chicken and left it on a rack on a pan in the fridge. Twenty minutes before cooking I took the chicken out of the fridge and put it on the counter so it wouldn't be cold when I added it to the pan. Just before cooking, I seasoned the chicken with Montreal chicken seasoning and smoked paprika pretty liberally. I heated the pan to 5/10 heat (medium high) on an electric stove with ghee as the oil. I waited three minutes for the pan to heat up I added the chicken in a single layer with plenty of space between them. The chicken sizzled when I added it. I cooked it for 6 minutes on one side and then flipped it and cooked for another 6 minutes. \n\nThe chicken didn't stick to the pan so that felt like a win but it also did not get any sear or crispy texture. The seasoning all fell off and stuck to the pan. When I pulled the chicken it was super greasy and I had to pat it off with a paper towel because it was gross. The chicken still had plenty of flavor when I ate it and was not super watery so that was nice. After patting off the ghee it was not oily anymore and was not a bad dinner. \n\nIt just feels like that wasn't what I was going for. \n\nIn the past I would cook in a nonstick pan with canola oil spray. I would have done it for 5 minutes on each side then covered it and turned off the heat and left it on the burner. This chicken would be less flavorful but very juicy. It would not have been oily and the seasoning would mostly fall off into water in the pan. \n\nWhat can I do better for stovetop boneless skinless chicken breast?

One thing to note is we did the whole eggs whites and all.\n\nThe pasta came out good. We both enjoyed it. Even thought it was good. We could only eat about half and got super full. Didn't think anything about it. \n\nCouple weeks went by and we wanted to do it again but I couldn't find the recipie again. So we went for another one and slightly changed the ingredients.  As its just the both of us we basically halved the recipie and we cooked it differently. Guanciale was cooked the same but removed from the pan. We got another pan that was room temp. Added the guanciale. I added 2 tsp of the fat from the pan to the cheese and egg mixture. Then added the pasta to the other pot. With the water and the egg cheese and fat. \n\nOne of the things we both noticed besides it being wayyyyy better was we were able to kill the whole thing! Do yall think thats because there was less than half of rendered fat in it? That was our assumption! \n\nHere's the list of ingredients and amounts.\nIf anyone could give advice on how it sounds?

Diet primarily consists of fast food, takeaways, cereal and ready meals that you put in the microwave. I have never tried cooking anything myself for various reasons.

Also have a wooden spoon, spatula, kitchen scales, measuring jug and grater. I bought most of these things within the last few days.

The chicken breast packaging itself says it needs to be cooked in a combination of the oven and pan. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/5ayyTod) is a photo of the back of the pack. Can I not just cook it in the pan exclusively along with the sauce? How do I know when the chicken is fully cooked (or at least cooked well enough to be safe to eat)?

Beyond receiving a hefty discount on food I buy there, there\u2019s often mistakenly made meals just lying around, free for the taking. I also struggled with an eating disorder for a while, and aiming for extreme limitation only reinforced my aversion to cooking. \n\nI feel SO lost when it comes to cooking, especially for one person. Trying to cook on a budget adds another mental barrier for me, not to mention the fact that I\u2019m still trying to shake some of the ED mindsets like \u201cgood/bad food,\u201d etc. \n\nI can follow basic recipes and can do very simple things: cook eggs (scrambled, over easy/hard, hard-boiled), boil pasta or vegetables, and bake chicken breast. But, the most basic stir-fry requires a call to my mom asking for walk-through instructions, even when using frozen veggies.\n\nI am desperate to become more adept, though, as I believe becoming a better cook could be really empowering for me!!\n\nI think I\u2019d like a cookbook of some sort.. finding recipes online feels like blindly navigating a maze to me, plus I often can\u2019t help falling back into my ED headspace when I turn to the internet (falling into \u201clow-carb\u201d or \u201clow-calorie\u201d rabbit holes). I get easily overwhelmed by the vastness of it all. \n\nSo, if anyone has recommendations for cookbooks for very new beginners, please help!\n\nI\u2019d also take any advice on how to grocery shop and cook for one on a budget - I always get nervous when I buy ingredients for a new recipe as I worry half of them will end up going to waste unless I make huge portions. \n\nThis got long, so if you made it this far: thank you!

{"title": "Cooking Basics", "selftext": "I am often able to whip up a meal from what I have in my house with no planning. Here's what I keep in my pantry for that purpose. I sometimes go to the store and just grab some meats and veggies and figure out the actual meals for the week when I get home.\n\nPantry Basics For Spontaneous Cooking:\nCanned coconut milk, Flour, Sugar (Regular & brown), Baking soda, Baking powder, 2-3 Pasta varieties, Rice, Tomato paste, Shelf-stable heavy cream if you can find it.\n\nFor baking:\n-Pecans, walnuts, chocolate chips, pumpkin pie spice, honey, vanilla extract\n\nFridge:\nParmesan cheese pairs with EVERYTHING (don't get pre-shredded and it will last longer), Eggs, Minced garlic, Better Than Bouillon base for chicken, beef, vegetable stocks, Heavy cream.\n\nExtras:\nThings I like to keep to add to sauces: olives, capers, red pesto sauce, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke antipasto. All have pretty long shelf lives.\n\nExtras I Keep Around (because they can always go into some kinda pasta dish, pasta salad, or dip):\nChickpeas, Orzo, Quinoa, Couscous.\n\nCooking Tips: When you're chopping vegetables, don't throw away the bits you don't eat (stems, bruised parts). Freeze them. Now you have the base of a vegetable stock. When you have enough quantity/variety of vegetable bits, pop them all in a pot of water, cover, and simmer for a few hours. Don't use onion or bell pepper for this, it will make the stock bitter.\n\nWhen your fruit is on the verge of going old, chop it up and freeze it for smoothies later.\n\nAlmost all dishes should be started by mincing garlic and onion, and cooking them in butter &/or oil until onions turn clear and garlic is fragrant. This will enhance just about everything you cook.\n\nAny soup is improved by throwing in the rind of a piece of parmesan, a bay leaf, &/or a little bit of celery. It brings out the flavors of other ingredients. Celery - you can chop it so small it cooks down.\n\nWhen making soup, make double portions. Freeze half in ice cube tray, then put cubes in freezer bag. You'll be grateful when you get sick and don't feel like cooking. Thaw it in a pot on medium-low heat or in the microwave.\n\nMaking bacon or sausage? Keep the grease in the fridge or freezer. Add it to sauces and soups for extra flavor.\n\nSour cream, plain Greek yogurt, or unsweetened coconut cream work in sauces if you're out of heavy cream. The flavor will be different but still good. Note that coconut, even unsweetened, has some sweetness to it.\n\nWhen baking, add a pinch of salt to sweet things like cake. It brings out the flavors.\n\n\nFLAVOR GROUPS: \n\nSalt, pepper, garlic, and onion have no enemies. I'm partial to a little Tony Chachere's on everything as well.\n\nSweet: Pumpkin pie spice is a good catchall.  Vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, star anise, brown sugar, honey.\n\nIt helps me to think of spices in sort of regional groups. This is obviously not an all-encompassing list of the flavors used by any particular culture, just a simple cheat sheet I've made.\n\nLemon, basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, marjoram (France... and lots of other places)\n\nGreen bell pepper, celery, onion, cayenne, paprika, parsley, garlic (Cajun)\n\nDill, cucumber, lime, lemon, basil, fennel, thyme, rosemary (Greek, Mediterranean)\n\nPaprika, garlic, chile pepper, brown sugar (southern BBQ)\n\nLime, cilantro, cumin, coriander (Mexican)\n\nTurmeric, cumin, curry, ginger, chili, cayenne, coriander (Indian)\n\nLemon, thyme, marjoram, coriander, ginger, saffron, turmeric (middle eastern)\n\nSoy, ginger, white pepper, mushroom, MSG, sesame, wasabi, garlic (Asian)\n\nWasabi, mirin, mushroom umami, schichimi togarashi, miso, ginger, soy, rice vinegar,  dashi (Japanese)\n\nShallot, garlic, chilies, galangal, kaffir lime, coconut milk, lemongrass (Thai)\n\n[Anyone feel free to pipe in with more info on this!]\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1j10zoo/cooking_basics/", "created_utc": 1740840305.0, "score": 34, "author": "Alternative-Soup2714", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1j10zoo/cooking_basics/", "html_title": ""}

I'm not really going to risk that.\n\nMoreso I'm just curious if anyone has experienced this before, and if anyone can explain why it would be this particular smell?\n\nI went into my kitchen and noticed the strong smell. It took us a minute to find the source. I had actually skipped over checking the bag of garlic bulbs because it didn't occur to me they could do that. I was telling my boyfriend something smelled, and he took out the garlic bag, said it smelled strange, and checked with me if that was what I was smelling. I said it was, and said the smell is like beef jerky and it's so weird. He kind of exclaimed \"that's what it smells like, I was trying to place it but that's exactly it.\" So it's not just me being crazy lol\n\nBut I did a Google search and nothing seems to reference this. I see stuff about smelling stronger than usual, smelling musty, smelling like rot... It's not any of those. It's not even an unpleasant smell. Just, not a smell you expect from garlic.\n\nFor context: I have a rolling cart with slide-out mesh basket drawers, white sits under a counter-height prep table against the back wall of my apartment kitchen. The garlic has been in the top basket of that. So, that area doesn't get much direct light, but it's not dark like an enclosed pantry. This is my first time using garlic from bulbs instead of only \"jarlic\" and garlic powder. I got the Costco bag sometime between 4-12 weeks ago? No idea, I figured it should last a while. The last couple times I have used any (it's been at least a week) some of the cloves had small sprouts starting inside, but nothing has sprouted through. \n\nSo guess maybe I'd also like some pointers on if there's better ways to store it. What factors are important as it relates to light, ventilation, or storing near other produce? How long can I reasonably expect garlic bulbs to last? But mostly I'm just really wanting an explanation for this puzzling smell!

It's the slowest, most inconsistent cooktop I've had the displeasure of using. \n\nOh you're making a stew and need to add broth? Well shoot, it's gonna take half an hour to bring that to a boil before you can simmer it. You want to stir fry? Best I can do is burning the fuck out of your eggs when you preheat the pan and then losing all of the heat when you add the rice so it ends up soggy and gross. Oh and if it _does_ actually get hot, now it's burning the crap out of your food unless you get it off the burner quick. The temperature settings might as well be a suggestion\n\nSo much of using this thing is just compensating for how much it sucks - any time I want to use water I have to boil it in my kettle first or else it's basically unusable and my kettle holds a max of 4 cups. Same deal with preheating but even then I can preheat it as much as I want and but it never seems to keep up on temperature once I actually start cooking with it. And it's getting to the point it's limiting what I want to cook outside of soups and stews because the thing is so finicky. I've given up on stir frying.\n\nAnd I know, I've already ohmed the elements out - they're within spec and flat. And it's getting 240v.

It's called halvas (\u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03b2\u03ac\u03c2) and it's made with sugar, water, canola oil, cinnamon and semolina.

It\u2019s currently cooking now. \nThis was the Cajun chicken pasta from budget bytes. \n\nAlso to add, the only reason I wanted to double it was because I had extra chicken and pasta, and was unsure how to preserve the extra chicken if I didn\u2019t double it, and assumed if I doubled it it would be an okay leftover dish.

{"title": "Dry toasting oats over a burner", "selftext": "Hi all, for some years I've been dry toasting 500g of rolled oats each week on an aluminium nonstick pan over a stove at low heat, I just stir them every 2 or 3 minutes and cook them for about 10 minutes. Recently I decided to move away from nonstick and bought a carbon steel pan that's still unseasoned. Meanwhile I decided to try toasting my oats on a stainless steel pot that I mainly use to boil beans. It's just an old medium-sized pot, nothing fancy, no aluminium layer or stuff. I put it over my smallest burner at lowest heat and even during the first minute if I stopped stirring for about 20 seconds, it would began to burn at the bottom. I mean awfully burn with black crusts over some spots. Probably heat distribution was too irregular and I should have been stirring non-stop, but anyway I decided it's a non-starter for me. Do you think I may have better luck with the carbon steel 3mm-thick pan once seasoned? Or perhaps a layered stainless steel pan? I don't want to turn on the oven for this nor to own so many pans. I was happy with my old procedure and I would like to approximate it while staying away from nonstick, if possible. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: today I attempted this again on a SS pan with a 3-layer bottom and the experience was much better. No burn nor crust but a nice toasting. Oats toast really faster than with my nonstick pan, so I have to be alert and stir more frequently, but altogether a more lenient pan.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jzasky/dry_toasting_oats_over_a_burner/", "created_utc": 1744666706.0, "score": 1, "author": "nnenneplex", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1jzasky/dry_toasting_oats_over_a_burner/", "html_title": ""}
