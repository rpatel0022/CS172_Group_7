{"title": "What the in-laws really ate during vacation \ud83d\ude44", "selftext": "My post from yesterday was really misunderstood (apparently due to my poor wording\u2014sorry, I\u2019m not a native English speaker). Most people thought that my photos of bread, biscuits, and crepes from our vacation were the only things we ate for 7 people over 13 days\u2026 So no, those were just pictures of baked goods I wanted to share, not our full menu, obviously \ud83d\ude05.\n\nSome even begged me to add protein or vegetables\u2026 wtf. We\u2019re French, and we eat bread, fruits, and vegetables at every meal\u2014it\u2019s completely normal for us. So reading those comments was really strange. I guess it\u2019s just a bit of a cultural difference.\n\nI didn\u2019t take many pictures of our main meals during the vacation, but I found some of the recipes we made on my website (with some adjustments\u2014like the zucchini in the thali from the first photo, which we swapped for a leek fondue because of the season).\n\nHere is the recipe for the thali (and the other ones are all on my website https://elinestable.com ) \n\nFor 4 servings : \n\n- basmati rice 3/4 (cups)\n- homemade vegan naans 4 - optional\n\nFor the dahl : \n- shallots 2\n- coral lentils 2/3 (cups)\n- tomato coulis 1/2 (cups)\n- turmeric powder 1 (tsp)\n- ginger powder 2 (tsp)\n- coconut milk 1 (cups)\n- garlic 2 (clove)\n- water 3 (cups)\n- neutral oil 2 (tbsp)\n\nFor the potato curry :\n- potatoes 1.3 (lb)\n- blanched or frozen peas 1 1/2 (cups)\n- nutritional yeast 1/2 (cups)\n- water 4 (cups)\n- curry 2 (tsp)\n- salt, pepper\n- neutral oil 2 (tbsp)\n\nFor the zucchini : \n- zucchini 2\n- sesame 2 (tbsp)\n- olive oil 2 (tbsp)\n- Garlic powder 1 (tsp)\n\nCook the rice in a pot of water.\nWe're going to manage the cookings at the same time, so before starting: cut the zucchini in half, then into slices. Peel the potato. Cut it into cubes. Peel and mince the shallot and the garlic clove.\nPrepare the potato curry: In a pan, heat up the oil and brown the potato for a few minutes. Deglaze with water, and add the green peas, nutritional yeast, curry, salt, and pepper. Let it cook until the water is completely reduced and the potatoes are well cooked.\nPrepare the dahl: In a small saucepan, heat the oil. Sweat the shallot in it. Add the garlic and then the raw lentils. Add the spices and allow them to roast for a few seconds before deglazing with water. Add salt and tomato puree, then simmer for about 12 minutes until the water evaporates and the texture of the dahl thickens. Then pour in the coconut milk!\nPrepare the zucchini: In a small frying pan, heat the oil. Cook the zucchini over medium heat for about 12 minutes. Then add sesame, salt, pepper, and garlic powder!\nHeat the naans in the oven.\nOn plates, serve the rice, dahl, potato curry, cooked zucchini, a naan, and some sunflower sprouts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4909l", "created_utc": 1741196869.0, "score": 6078, "author": "ElineBonnin", "num_comments": 494, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1j4909l/what_the_inlaws_really_ate_during_vacation/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Red Pepper Vegan Ravioli", "selftext": "[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-ravioli)\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the Ravioli Dough:\n\n- 300g all-purpose flour\n- 100g semolina flour\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 200ml warm water\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n\nFor the Ravioli Filling:\n\n- 200g firm tofu, crumbled\n- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast\n- 1 clove garlic, minced\n- 1 tbsp lemon juice\n- Salt and black pepper, to taste\n\nFor the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:\n\n- 3 large red bell peppers\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 200ml vegan cream cheese\n- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast\n- 1 tsp smoked paprika\n- 1 tsp dried oregano\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- 1 tsp lemon juice\n\nFor Garnish:\n\n- Fresh basil leaves, chopped\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.\n\n2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\n3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the saut\u00e9ed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.\n\n4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.\n\n5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.\n\n6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.\n\n7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.\n\n8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.\n\n9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/36crobcyio2e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1732379930.0, "score": 1358, "author": "Whiterabbit2000", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1gy3qeq/red_pepper_vegan_ravioli/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Vegan sushi is really easy! I make it once a week", "selftext": "If you have a rice cooker, rinse your sushi rice until it runs clear and then put in a splash of rice wine vinegar, a tablespoon of sugar, and a little salt. Otherwise, stovetop is fine. You're going to want a short grained rice.\n\nThe filling I did today was five spears asparagus, a small sweet potato, and avocado. I cooked up the sweet potato matchsticks and asparagus in a skillet while my eel sauce was reducing.\n\nEel sauce: equal parts soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Just simmer until thick. 1/4 cup of each will perfectly fit in a soy sauce dish and is probably enough for 2 or even 3 people.\n\nPut down some aluminum foil in a baking tray and spread the prepared rice on it to quickly cool.\n\nYou can watch a quick YouTube video on how to roll them, but I'll explain anyway. You can get a cheap bamboo rolling mat if you make it a lot, but for years I just used a bit of plastic wrap. Put rice on most of the nori (shiny side down) leaving 1/2 inch plain on the end. Lay filling in a line down the middle. Roll the nori over the filling, then complete the roll and shape evenly with slight pressure. Use a large serrated knife to cut it in a gentle sawing motion. If you want to use a non serrated knife it needs to be really sharp. The thing to do is to lightly cut into the wrap a little before you add more pressure. It'll make sense when you do it.\n\nBonus: crunchy stuff is just panko toasted in vegan butter. You can do spicy mayo with just sriracha and vegan mayo, but go heavy on the sriracha. You can get wasabi and pickled ginger online if your store doesn't sell it.\n\nFor those who want to know, the sushi pictured was 800 calories and 17 grams of protein.\n\nAll this to say, once the rice is ready it'll take 5 to 10 minutes to prepare. I made 2 cups of rice for 3 rolls, but didn't use it all. Also, not pictured are all the end pieces I ate while I was making it.\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/bq2da3vrbo5e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1733685056.0, "score": 1268, "author": "Chamomile_Tisane", "num_comments": 50, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1h9q8bo/vegan_sushi_is_really_easy_i_make_it_once_a_week/", "html_title": ""}

We try to stay in short-term rentals when we can so that we have a kitchen, but there might also be times when I have to stay in a motel with no kitchen. And in any case, I'll be working long hours in the field with not a lot of time to spend cooking dinner. \n\nWhat are some quick, easy dinners that I can plan to make while traveling that are still healthy, filling, and have a good amount of protein and vegetables? Ideally they would take no longer than 10-15 mins to make a single (large) serving, use minimal dishes, and not require me to transport a bunch of tupperware containers to store leftovers in.\n\nWhen I've traveled in the past, my go-to has been pasta with jarred red sauce and vegan sausage, and as much as I love pasta, I don't want to eat the same thing every day.

{"title": "Suggestions needed - picky eater (ARFID) SEVERELY struggling with my protein intake", "selftext": "First off I cannot have most protein powders! They are VERY rough of my stomach so I will throw up after less than a quarter of a serving of one. I found one vegan protein shake in local stores I can drink (being the chocolate OWYN) that doesn't make me sick but I don't want to drink more than one a day, especially because they're not the cheapest thing either.\n\nI have always struggled very hard with protein before being vegan because I never liked meat or eggs at all so I have been protein deficient for a very long time. I went vegan for good a few months ago and since then have been working on finding recipes to rotate between. Right now I make a mean lentil soup, tomato and white bean soup, granola bars, and occasionally waffles to meal prep for advance. Otherwise I almost selectively eat one specific brand of vegan chicken nuggets, bean burritos, edamame, and PB+J as my protein sources.\n\nI am a very picky eater (diagnosed ARFID I've been hospitalized for before, autism related sensory-texture issues), but my current plan of action has been trying to find easy recipes that I can try and learn to love! I haven't tried MOST vegan foods and recipes! I've never had Seitan, Tempeh or TVP and only had Tofu once. I have tried quite a few \"beyond\" type frozen chicken and burgers and I didn't enjoy any of them honestly so I'm trying to find recipes with more \"\"whole\"\" foods. I love vegetables and LOVE carbs lol but protein I'm super inexperienced with and have no grasp on! I also suck at cooking!!!\n\nSo please give me your easy go-to recipes to be able to get your recommended amount of protein! No hate, but I seem to only find recipes online with very low protein when I look for easy recipes.

While the noodles are cooking and the cashews are blending, prepare the basil, greens and chick\u2019n. First, put the frozen greens bag in the microwave to steam. Then, toss the chick\u2019n into the air fryer, checking frequently to prevent overcooking. While those cook, roll up your basil and slice it in a chiffonade style.\n\n4. Once the noodles are al dente, reserve some pasta water in a mug. Drain the noodles and return to pot.\n\n5.

{"title": "The best Passover brisket", "selftext": "A real brisket is all about the sauce you cook it in. I have been experimenting with different meat subs, and because I wanted to taste like my grandmother's brisket, I started by making my grandmother's sauce.\n\n**BRISKET SAUCE**\n \n- 1.5 lb (680 g) carrots, peeled and cut into 2 inch lengths\n\n- 2 medium brown onions cut into eighths\n\n- 1 box (both packets) Lipton onion soup mix \u2013 they make versions that are kosher for Passover, but the regular works the rest of the year\n\n- 1.5 cups (about 350 ml) Heinz ketchup \u2013 you can use other ketchups, but don't use Del Monte catsup, as it's too sweet and not tangy enough\n\n- 2 cups (about 450 ml) Manischewitz Concorde grape wine - you may not use all of this\n\n- 1 tbsp (15 ml, about 2 g) powdered ginger  \n\n.\n\n1. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C, gas mark 3).\n\n2. Crush the contents of the onion soup packets.\n\n3. Mix the ketchup, wine, onion soup mix, and ginger.\n\n4. Prepare a baking pan with oil or cooking spray. \n\n5. Spread the carrots and onions in the pan and top with the sauce.\n\n6. Cover pan with foil and cook for two hours. Carrots should be easily pierced with a fork.\n\n7. Strain out the chunks of carrots and onions with a small amount of the sauce and pur\u00e9e in a food processor. You may have to work in batches. Mix the pur\u00e9ed vegetables back into the sauce.\n\n8. Refrigerate the sauce overnight.\n\n. \n\n**MAKING THE BRISKET**\n\nHonestly, at this point, you can do whatever you want in terms of a meat sub. I have tried two and in my family the results are mixed, with two people preferring the mushroom brisket and two people preferring the jackfruit brisket. No one disliked either version, just preferred one over the other.\n\n**Mushroom Brisket**\n\nThis recipe looks more like a beef brisket served as the centerpiece of a meal.\n\n- 1.5 lb (680 g) portobello or trumpet mushrooms\n\n- 1 14 oz (about 400 g) block of firm tofu\n\n- 1/2 cup (about 120 ml) olive oil\n\n- 3 tbsp (45 ml) soy sauce \n\n.\n\n1. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C, gas mark 3).\n\n2. Drain the tofu and press out as much liquid as you can.\n\n3. Using the largest holes on a box grater, grate the tofu.\n\n4. If using portobello mushrooms, remove the stems and gills. Using a fork, shred the mushrooms.\n\n5. Mix the mushrooms, tofu, olive oil, and soy sauce in a bowl.\n\n6. Prepare a baking pan. You can spread the tofu/mushroom mixture evenly across the pan as if you were making Good Shepherd's Pie. I like to form it into an elongated lump so that it's sort of resembles a brisket.\n\n7. Cover in foil and bake in the oven until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes.\n\n8. Uncover and pour over your sauce. Bake another 30 minutes, until the sauce is warmed through.\n\n. \n\n**Jackfruit Brisket**\n\nThis recipe looks more like a pan of pulled barbecue. It does look less formal.\n\n- Two 20 oz (280 g drained wt) cans of young jackfruit in water or brine.\n\n. \n\n1. Drain and rinse the jackfruit.\n\n2. Squeeze the individual pieces to get out as much liquid as you can. It's OK if you crush them.\n\n3. Use forks to shred the jackfruit.\n\n4. Put the sauce in a large sauce pan and bring to a boil.\n\n5. Add the jackfruit. Reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for at least 30 minutes.\n\nYou can serve immediately, but I find it best to refrigerate it and re-warm it in a baking pan in a 350\u00b0F (270\u00b0C, gas mark 4) oven for about half an hour.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jybwuq/the_best_passover_brisket/", "created_utc": 1744562519.0, "score": 16, "author": "TychaBrahe", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jybwuq/the_best_passover_brisket/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

From what I understand, the core recipe is vital wheat gluten, some sort of flour, water, and salt. How much of that can be changed? I understand that the vital wheat gluten is non-negotiable, but what about the flour? Could I use hemp powder, or almond meal if I want something different? Could I add coconut milk powder to make a more fatty seitan? Could I add soluable fibre or psyllium husk for more fibre?

Adjust to taste: more lemon zest for brightness, basil for boldness, or coconut milk for a thinner consistency.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nNotes:\n- Cashews give the creamiest result \u2014 almonds can work but have a stronger flavor.\n- Roasted garlic adds a mellow depth, but you can omit for a cleaner taste.\n- This stores well for a few days in the fridge \u2014 just stir before using.\n- Pairs beautifully with GF pasta, roasted veggies, or even as a sandwich spread.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/vetepy4n0bue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744420124.0, "score": 53, "author": "GimmeaHellYea", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jx5nkq/creamy_vegan_basil_pesto_gf_oilfree_option/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Inexpensive(?) Meal Prep Seitan", "selftext": "I think I finally cracked the code in terms of what works for me when balancing frugality/time/variety when it comes to meal prep, so I just wanted to share in case it helps anyone else. I'm a college student who usually is out of the house from 8:30-6:30, so my options are either packing a lunch, starving, or shelling out some money. For the past two weeks I've just been sporadically making this really quickly in the morning and bringing it with me in some tupperware. Set some rice up to cook while you fry the seitan and the whole process takes only 15 mins out of my morning.\n\nMaybe not the healthiest choice of sauces on my part? But that part's up to you, I guess.\n\n**Recipes**\n\n[Nora Cooks' Seitan](https://www.noracooks.com/easy-seitan-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-23584): I meal prepped a massive batch (recipe x 6) and stored it in the freezer in two gallon ziploc bags. You could probably experiment a lot with the seasonings; I also made a smaller batch with paprika in it. It'll puff up a lot while it's steaming, so make sure not to make the chunks too large. The texture can be iffy, so I knead for five minutes, let it sit for a half hour, then give it another quick kneading. It defrosts fine. The night before I take out whatever I want for the next day and move it to the fridge. From there it's as simple as frying it briefly then dumping the sauce on. I have two sauces that I like:\u00a0[Orange Chicken Sauce](https://tasty.co/recipe/original-orange-chicken-by-panda-express)\u00a0and\u00a0[Sriracha Sauce](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/honey-sriracha-chicken/#wprm-recipe-container-21997).\n\nI make the sauces ahead of time, store them in smaller ziplocks, and just dump them in the pan in the morning. For both of these I just mix the cornstarch right in with the sauce instead of waiting. It's easier, and I'm lazy. Pro tip, though: if you have the time to \"bread\" them, they taste really good. I just dunk them in a bowl of water then in a bowl of flour/cornstarch mix.\n\nI'll often cook with rice and add some frozen veggies/broccoli.\n\nI'm sure more creative people would have more varied ideas. There's this, which is pretty good with tofu but as-of-yet untested with seitan:\u00a0[https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/buffalo-tofu/#recipe](https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/buffalo-tofu/#recipe)\n\nI also used a different seitan recipe to make this in the past, and it turned out delicious:\u00a0[https://www.stephsunshine.com/vegan-life/crispy-fried-tofu/](https://www.stephsunshine.com/vegan-life/crispy-fried-tofu/)\n\nI've seen some people online mention seitan having a weird taste. I'm basically a garbage disposal with no palete, so I've never noticed it regardless of which recipe/method I used. However, I've heard that adding a touch of baking powder will reduce that taste.\n\n**Price Breakdown**\n\nHere's some screenshots that I pulled from my spreadsheet. I'm in a MCOL city in the Midwest. These are the numbers from my local Kroger's and Target (the Target boycott is still ongoing for the next couple weeks, though).\n\n[Seitan Base Price \\(per serving: 300kal, 36p, 17c, 9f\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7br4uhldgtse1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cc3ac4b18e57275ae45bcb424aa097f5c858f84)\n\n[Sriracha Sauce Price](https://preview.redd.it/lrfv7ehggtse1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecdc859ab5bee101992c4cacae4ffe0cedac5669)\n\n[Orange Sauce Price](https://preview.redd.it/emqs1nwigtse1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b1d17b6a5145304dca833824975ab08b5d40e51)\n\n[Buffalo Sauce](https://preview.redd.it/iu10582lgtse1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=a759a5d2c4334cd7df37ddb98935b3357b7ccfa4)\n\nI got my VWG and Nooch from\u00a0[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Anthonys-Premium-Nutritional-Flakes-Gluten/dp/B08L448J12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8). Anthony's has a bundle for a pretty decent price now that it's on sale (4lbs VWG+1lbs Nooch). In total each serving comes to just under $2 for me, including the rice and veggies. It's extremely filling as well.\n\nI'm sure people who like wraps can also make it that way. A commenter under the Nora Cooks recipe said that they were putting it in chili. The macros for the base seitan are pretty good, and when I ate a couple 'raw' to see how they tasted, it wasn't bad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jrbbyp/inexpensive_meal_prep_seitan/", "created_utc": 1743771740.0, "score": 12, "author": "CallieCarr465", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jrbbyp/inexpensive_meal_prep_seitan/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

(we cook this separately and add in later so they don\u2019t completely soften in the sauce.)\n\n3-4 shallots, diced  \n2 packs cremini mushrooms, sliced  \n4 cloves of garlic, minced  \nRosemary and thyme, minced, about a tablespoon of each  \nBay leaf or two   \nSoy sauce  \n\u00bc tsp paprika  \nCognac (\\~\u2153 cup)  \nWhite wine (\\~\u2153 cup)  \n3-4 tbsp flour  \nVegan butter  \nDijon mustard   \n3 cups broth (No-Beef Better than Bouillon)  \nPasta of choice - I like mafaldine for this but really anything would work  \nChive, parsley, and/or sliced gherkins for garnish\n\n\n\n1. Start a big pot of salted water boiling for your pasta. (We want the sauce finished and simmering before the pasta finishes.)\n2. Start mushrooms on a med-high saut\u00e9 with a small bit of olive oil in a large deep pan or braiser. Salt lightly and let them sweat out, and once their water has mostly evaporated and you start to see some browning on them, add a bit of vegan butter, the diced shallots, and porcini. Continue saut\u00e9ing until the shallots are translucent, fragrant, and the mushrooms have browned more and a fond is forming.\u00a0\n3. Add in the garlic, rosemary, thyme, and paprika. Saut\u00e9 another minute until fragrant. Add a splash of soy sauce and let cook for a minute while stirring until it smells a bit toasty.\u00a0\n4. Add a couple more tablespoons of vegan butter, and then add 3-4 tablespoons of flour. Keep mixing and let cook for another \\~2 min.\n5. You should have a good looking fond on the bottom of your pan at this point. Turn off the flame(!) and add in a healthy splash of cognac and white wine. Turn the heat back up to high and let reduce and cook off until evaporated.\u00a0\n6. Add in the porcini mushroom broth and 2 cups of the no-beef broth (to start). Add the beyond crumbles and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. It should start to slightly thicken.\u00a0\n7. Add the cashew cream until desired creaminess level is achieved. You can add a bit more no-beef broth and cashew cream in small portions to balance out to your preferences. Add about a teaspoon and a half of dijon mustard. Taste for salt, pepper, and tanginess (dijon). Adjust as needed. Let simmer for 10-15 minutes, it should continue to thicken slightly.\n8. When pasta is al dente, strain and reserve a little pasta water. To a separate pan add a couple cups of your stroganoff sauce and bring back up to med-high heat. Add in pasta and cook for a few more minutes, tossing to mix. Add more cashew cream to thicken or pasta water to thin, to your preference. Taste one more time for salt and pepper.\u00a0\n9.

I'd probably occasionally use it for fruit sorbets myself as a bonus but the main consideration is something able to make a somewhat traditional chocolate ice cream.\n\nMore affordable options are ideal.I'm a university student lol.

{"title": "Hemp & Cashew milk (+ how to buy sustainable cashews)", "selftext": "I\u2019m loving making my own plant-based milks more and more\u2014it\u2019s just so easy! This one, made with cashews and hemp, is packed with goodness. Rich in healthy fats, protein, omega-3 and 6, vitamin E, and magnesium. It\u2019s ready in minutes and keeps for 3-4 days in the fridge in a bottle. I use it in drinks, for cooking, or simply with a bowl of cereal! \n\n- cashew nuts 180 (g)*\n- Hemp seeds 50 (g)\n- water 875 (mL)\n\nSoak the cashews in a large bowl of water. If using cashew pieces like the ones I get from Umano, soak for 45 minutes. For whole cashews, allow about 2 hours.\nDrain the cashews. In a blender, blend them with the hemp seeds and half of the water. Blend on high speed for about 2 minutes.\nAdd the rest of the water and blend for another minute. Strain the milk through a fine mesh strainer or a cloth. Store in a bottle for up to 4 days.\n\n* I\u2019ve been raising awareness for several years now about the origins of the cashews I use in my recipes. Because being vegan also means being empathetic\u2014and not rushing to buy products that cause human disasters!\n\nTo recap, when cashews are shelled by hand, a corrosive substance from the nut can come into contact with the workers\u2019 hands (mostly women). This issue has been widely discussed. Some importers (like Umano in Quebec, where I buy mine) source their cashews from ethical cooperatives (notably in Burkina Faso). Their technique involves combining steam preheating with coating their hands in vegetable oil. These standards are required by the Fairtrade label, so nowadays, harmful shelling conditions have become much rarer.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a significant amount of waste in the process, as not all cashews come out perfectly intact. That\u2019s why I buy cashew pieces\u2014they\u2019re cheaper and help reduce waste. They\u2019re also super convenient to cook with and take less time to soak.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been made aware of fair trade when it comes to buying coffee and chocolate. But the same applies to cashews\u2014we can choose fair trade products that ensure better pay for producers.\n\nCashews go through an intensive process\u2014growing, harvesting, drying, shelling\u2014it takes hundreds of hours of labor, and that labor deserves fair pay. The worst part? Over the last three years, the price paid per kilo outside of fair trade has dropped by 40%! Meanwhile, fair trade pricing is always calculated to ensure a viable income for producers. Right now, fair trade cashews are paid twice as much as conventional ones. It\u2019s not just \u201ca little better paid\u201d\u2014it\u2019s twice as much! That makes a real difference, with positive impacts for the entire community.\n\nAnother thing most people don\u2019t know about the cashew industry is that almost all cashews are grown in West Africa, but many are then shipped to Asia for shelling\u2014before being sent back to us for sale. Ridiculous, right? Why make things so complicated when they could be simple?\n\nSo, for me, buying fair trade-certified cashews from a direct importer is the only way to guarantee fair pay for producers, the most direct transportation, and steam shelling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j84qeq", "created_utc": 1741629100.0, "score": 95, "author": "ElineBonnin", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1j84qeq/hemp_cashew_milk_how_to_buy_sustainable_cashews/", "html_title": ""}

Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, and place a light weight on top for about 10 minutes to help press out excess moisture. Once pressed, slice it into cubes of roughly 2\u20133 cm. In a bowl, combine the chilli powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the tofu, stirring gently so each piece is coated. Allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\n\n   Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the ends, and cut it into wedges\u2014aim for around 6\u20138 wedges per onion, depending on its size. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers, then chop them into bite-sized chunks of about 2\u20133 cm. Set the vegetables aside while the tofu marinates.\n\n2. Warm 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. If using cumin seeds, add them first and let them sizzle for a few seconds.

Add the onion wedges, green pepper, and red pepper to the same pan. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes, allowing the edges to caramelise lightly for extra depth of flavour. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Sprinkle in the ground coriander and garam masala, tossing the vegetables until they\u2019re well coated. Add the chopped tomatoes or passata, followed by the tomato pur\u00e9e and sugar. Season with \u00bd teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste). Let the sauce simmer for about 5\u20137 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\n\n5. Return the golden tofu cubes to the pan, folding them into the sauce so each piece is evenly coated. Add the chopped fresh coriander and stir. Cook for another 1\u20132 minutes to ensure the tofu absorbs all the flavours.\n\n6.

Most people thought that my photos of bread, biscuits, and crepes from our vacation were the only things we ate for 7 people over 13 days\u2026 So no, those were just pictures of baked goods I wanted to share, not our full menu, obviously \ud83d\ude05.\n\nSome even begged me to add protein or vegetables\u2026 wtf. We\u2019re French, and we eat bread, fruits, and vegetables at every meal\u2014it\u2019s completely normal for us. So reading those comments was really strange. I guess it\u2019s just a bit of a cultural difference.\n\nI didn\u2019t take many pictures of our main meals during the vacation, but I found some of the recipes we made on my website (with some adjustments\u2014like the zucchini in the thali from the first photo, which we swapped for a leek fondue because of the season).\n\nHere is the recipe for the thali (and the other ones are all on my website https://elinestable.com ) \n\nFor 4 servings : \n\n- basmati rice 3/4 (cups)\n- homemade vegan naans 4 - optional\n\nFor the dahl : \n- shallots 2\n- coral lentils 2/3 (cups)\n- tomato coulis 1/2 (cups)\n- turmeric powder 1 (tsp)\n- ginger powder 2 (tsp)\n- coconut milk 1 (cups)\n- garlic 2 (clove)\n- water 3 (cups)\n- neutral oil 2 (tbsp)\n\nFor the potato curry :\n- potatoes 1.3 (lb)\n- blanched or frozen peas 1 1/2 (cups)\n- nutritional yeast 1/2 (cups)\n- water 4 (cups)\n- curry 2 (tsp)\n- salt, pepper\n- neutral oil 2 (tbsp)\n\nFor the zucchini : \n- zucchini 2\n- sesame 2 (tbsp)\n- olive oil 2 (tbsp)\n- Garlic powder 1 (tsp)\n\nCook the rice in a pot of water.\nWe're going to manage the cookings at the same time, so before starting: cut the zucchini in half, then into slices. Peel the potato. Cut it into cubes. Peel and mince the shallot and the garlic clove.\nPrepare the potato curry: In a pan, heat up the oil and brown the potato for a few minutes. Deglaze with water, and add the green peas, nutritional yeast, curry, salt, and pepper. Let it cook until the water is completely reduced and the potatoes are well cooked.\nPrepare the dahl: In a small saucepan, heat the oil. Sweat the shallot in it. Add the garlic and then the raw lentils. Add the spices and allow them to roast for a few seconds before deglazing with water. Add salt and tomato puree, then simmer for about 12 minutes until the water evaporates and the texture of the dahl thickens. Then pour in the coconut milk!\nPrepare the zucchini: In a small frying pan, heat the oil. Cook the zucchini over medium heat for about 12 minutes. Then add sesame, salt, pepper, and garlic powder!\nHeat the naans in the oven.\nOn plates, serve the rice, dahl, potato curry, cooked zucchini, a naan, and some sunflower sprouts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4909l", "created_utc": 1741196869.0, "score": 6077, "author": "ElineBonnin", "num_comments": 494, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1j4909l/what_the_inlaws_really_ate_during_vacation/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Orange Tofu and Broccoli", "selftext": "Adapted from Adam Ragusea's orange chicken video with some tweaks, notably using tofu cubes instead of chicken hahaha.\n\nFor the tofu I like a really firm dense texture so I froze it, thawed it, and then microwaved it to get as much water out as possible. Then I coated it with A LOT of corn starch, enough that all the surface liquid was absorbed. This is the most important detail from the original recipe IMO and it was the mistake I had made with corn starch coatings before. Fried the cubes and and removed them to a plate with a paper towel. \n\nFor the sauce I saut\u00e9ed 3 cloves garlic, an equal sized knob of ginger, and scallion whites until softened. Then the liquids: 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons chili oil, 2 tablespoons sugar (half of what's in the original recipe) and the juice of two big oranges. Got that all simmering and added a corn starch slurry to thicken. Off heat, toss the tofu and steamed broccoli in the sauce along with the zest of one orange. Plate and garnish with scallion greens and sesame seeds. \n\nI was really happy with the results! The tofu stayed crispy even in the sauce which was a pleasant surprise and overall it wasn't too much work. You could probably get more out of it by marinating the tofu in some flavorful sauce or using crushed Szechuan peppers instead of chili oil but for a weeknight meal it was very doable.

We try to stay in short-term rentals when we can so that we have a kitchen, but there might also be times when I have to stay in a motel with no kitchen. And in any case, I'll be working long hours in the field with not a lot of time to spend cooking dinner. \n\nWhat are some quick, easy dinners that I can plan to make while traveling that are still healthy, filling, and have a good amount of protein and vegetables? Ideally they would take no longer than 10-15 mins to make a single (large) serving, use minimal dishes, and not require me to transport a bunch of tupperware containers to store leftovers in.\n\nWhen I've traveled in the past, my go-to has been pasta with jarred red sauce and vegan sausage, and as much as I love pasta, I don't want to eat the same thing every day. I'm not a big fan of beyond/impossible burgers, but otherwise I'm open to any suggestions!\n\nI'll be grocery shopping before I leave on these trips when I can, so I'll have access to pretty much whatever vegan items I want, I just need to be able to transport them all. And the amount of money that I can spend and get reimbursed for food is way higher than I could ever spend just on groceries, so feel free to go wild with your suggestions!\n\nThanks and I look forward to hearing any suggestions you might have!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1k80210/lowprep_dinner_ideas/", "created_utc": 1745626784.0, "score": 18, "author": "OptimistBotanist", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1k80210/lowprep_dinner_ideas/", "html_title": ""}

Let it rest for 20 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 180\u00b0C (355\u00b0F).\nPrepare the filling: Whisk the chickpea flour with turmeric, salt, and pepper. Gradually add the soy milk while whisking to form a smooth paste. Then pour in the soy cream and whisk again. If using frozen spinach: simply thaw the spinach and add it to the mixture, along with half of the vegan feta. If using fresh spinach: remove the thickest stems. In a saucepan, cook the spinach for a few minutes until wilted, then roughly chop and add to the mixture along with half of the vegan feta.\nRoll out the pie dough on a floured surface using a rolling pin to form a circle (about 30 cm / 12 inches in diameter).

I went vegan for good a few months ago and since then have been working on finding recipes to rotate between. Right now I make a mean lentil soup, tomato and white bean soup, granola bars, and occasionally waffles to meal prep for advance. Otherwise I almost selectively eat one specific brand of vegan chicken nuggets, bean burritos, edamame, and PB+J as my protein sources.\n\nI am a very picky eater (diagnosed ARFID I've been hospitalized for before, autism related sensory-texture issues), but my current plan of action has been trying to find easy recipes that I can try and learn to love!

{"title": "The best Passover brisket", "selftext": "A real brisket is all about the sauce you cook it in. I have been experimenting with different meat subs, and because I wanted to taste like my grandmother's brisket, I started by making my grandmother's sauce.\n\n**BRISKET SAUCE**\n \n- 1.5 lb (680 g) carrots, peeled and cut into 2 inch lengths\n\n- 2 medium brown onions cut into eighths\n\n- 1 box (both packets) Lipton onion soup mix \u2013 they make versions that are kosher for Passover, but the regular works the rest of the year\n\n- 1.5 cups (about 350 ml) Heinz ketchup \u2013 you can use other ketchups, but don't use Del Monte catsup, as it's too sweet and not tangy enough\n\n- 2 cups (about 450 ml) Manischewitz Concorde grape wine - you may not use all of this\n\n- 1 tbsp (15 ml, about 2 g) powdered ginger  \n\n.\n\n1. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C, gas mark 3).\n\n2. Crush the contents of the onion soup packets.\n\n3. Mix the ketchup, wine, onion soup mix, and ginger.\n\n4. Prepare a baking pan with oil or cooking spray. \n\n5. Spread the carrots and onions in the pan and top with the sauce.\n\n6. Cover pan with foil and cook for two hours. Carrots should be easily pierced with a fork.\n\n7. Strain out the chunks of carrots and onions with a small amount of the sauce and pur\u00e9e in a food processor. You may have to work in batches. Mix the pur\u00e9ed vegetables back into the sauce.\n\n8. Refrigerate the sauce overnight.\n\n. \n\n**MAKING THE BRISKET**\n\nHonestly, at this point, you can do whatever you want in terms of a meat sub. I have tried two and in my family the results are mixed, with two people preferring the mushroom brisket and two people preferring the jackfruit brisket. No one disliked either version, just preferred one over the other.\n\n**Mushroom Brisket**\n\nThis recipe looks more like a beef brisket served as the centerpiece of a meal.\n\n- 1.5 lb (680 g) portobello or trumpet mushrooms\n\n- 1 14 oz (about 400 g) block of firm tofu\n\n- 1/2 cup (about 120 ml) olive oil\n\n- 3 tbsp (45 ml) soy sauce \n\n.\n\n1. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C, gas mark 3).\n\n2. Drain the tofu and press out as much liquid as you can.\n\n3. Using the largest holes on a box grater, grate the tofu.\n\n4. If using portobello mushrooms, remove the stems and gills. Using a fork, shred the mushrooms.\n\n5. Mix the mushrooms, tofu, olive oil, and soy sauce in a bowl.\n\n6. Prepare a baking pan. You can spread the tofu/mushroom mixture evenly across the pan as if you were making Good Shepherd's Pie. I like to form it into an elongated lump so that it's sort of resembles a brisket.\n\n7. Cover in foil and bake in the oven until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes.\n\n8. Uncover and pour over your sauce. Bake another 30 minutes, until the sauce is warmed through.\n\n. \n\n**Jackfruit Brisket**\n\nThis recipe looks more like a pan of pulled barbecue. It does look less formal.\n\n- Two 20 oz (280 g drained wt) cans of young jackfruit in water or brine.\n\n. \n\n1. Drain and rinse the jackfruit.\n\n2. Squeeze the individual pieces to get out as much liquid as you can. It's OK if you crush them.\n\n3. Use forks to shred the jackfruit.\n\n4. Put the sauce in a large sauce pan and bring to a boil.\n\n5. Add the jackfruit. Reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for at least 30 minutes.\n\nYou can serve immediately, but I find it best to refrigerate it and re-warm it in a baking pan in a 350\u00b0F (270\u00b0C, gas mark 4) oven for about half an hour.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jybwuq/the_best_passover_brisket/", "created_utc": 1744562519.0, "score": 18, "author": "TychaBrahe", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jybwuq/the_best_passover_brisket/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What can be done to the actual recipe for seitan that can affect textures, tastes, and mouthfeel?", "selftext": "Hey all. I'm slowly transitioning to a vegan diet, having cut out red meat, and fish, and decreased chicken consumption. I'm looking at making the jump to be completely meat-free and have decided on seitan to try as a main protein. I have tried tofu, and enjoyed it, but I have trouble cooking it. I can't seem to get it marinated right, all the way through. I went to a vegan Vietnamese cafe with a friend of mine and had a banh mi with char siu seitan and it was magnificent. It really is something I can envision completely replacing meat products for me.\n\nNow I'm looking at jumping on board with it and am wondering how versatile the actual core recipe is. From what I understand, the core recipe is vital wheat gluten, some sort of flour, water, and salt. How much of that can be changed? I understand that the vital wheat gluten is non-negotiable, but what about the flour? Could I use hemp powder, or almond meal if I want something different? Could I add coconut milk powder to make a more fatty seitan? Could I add soluable fibre or psyllium husk for more fibre? Instead of water, could I use shaoxing, cooking sherry, or red/white wine?\n\nIt seems incredibly versatile when putting stuff on it, but does that versatility extend to what you make it with?

{"title": "Need Emergency Baking Advice", "selftext": "Hai peoples!  I\u2019ve got an extreme situation on my hands and I need all the advice I can get!  Super bonus points if you bake gluten free too because my mom and I both have celiac.  \n\nMy mom\u2019s birthday is in a week and I\u2019m planning on making her a cake for it naturally.  The rub is that we\u2019ve been vegan for only a few years and baking is something we still haven\u2019t mastered.  After a discussion about what she wants for her dinner/what kind of cake, she promptly told me that if I needed to use eggs and make the cake non-vegan, she\u2019d be okay with that.  (Please don\u2019t be upset with her, the poor woman just wants to enjoy her birthday and we became vegan because of a medical diagnosis that put us on this path, one the whole family is happier for, usually.)\n\nSo, now that I sat my bruised ego aside, I\u2019m determined to give her a cake she can enjoy, that is gluten free AND fully vegan, and that isn\u2019t gummy hopefully.  But I\u2019m still figuring out baking vegan and I\u2019m not always successful at getting my goods to not be stodgy and gummy.  \n\nCan anyone help me with some advice to prevent this from happening or share a fool proof cake recipe with me?  I\u2019d really appreciate all the tips I can get!  I will note that she prefers not using flax eggs as her body doesn\u2019t always respond well to those for some reason.

{"title": "Inexpensive(?) Meal Prep Seitan", "selftext": "I think I finally cracked the code in terms of what works for me when balancing frugality/time/variety when it comes to meal prep, so I just wanted to share in case it helps anyone else. I'm a college student who usually is out of the house from 8:30-6:30, so my options are either packing a lunch, starving, or shelling out some money. For the past two weeks I've just been sporadically making this really quickly in the morning and bringing it with me in some tupperware. Set some rice up to cook while you fry the seitan and the whole process takes only 15 mins out of my morning.\n\nMaybe not the healthiest choice of sauces on my part? But that part's up to you, I guess.\n\n**Recipes**\n\n[Nora Cooks' Seitan](https://www.noracooks.com/easy-seitan-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-23584): I meal prepped a massive batch (recipe x 6) and stored it in the freezer in two gallon ziploc bags. You could probably experiment a lot with the seasonings; I also made a smaller batch with paprika in it. It'll puff up a lot while it's steaming, so make sure not to make the chunks too large. The texture can be iffy, so I knead for five minutes, let it sit for a half hour, then give it another quick kneading. It defrosts fine. The night before I take out whatever I want for the next day and move it to the fridge. From there it's as simple as frying it briefly then dumping the sauce on. I have two sauces that I like:\u00a0[Orange Chicken Sauce](https://tasty.co/recipe/original-orange-chicken-by-panda-express)\u00a0and\u00a0[Sriracha Sauce](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/honey-sriracha-chicken/#wprm-recipe-container-21997).\n\nI make the sauces ahead of time, store them in smaller ziplocks, and just dump them in the pan in the morning. For both of these I just mix the cornstarch right in with the sauce instead of waiting. It's easier, and I'm lazy. Pro tip, though: if you have the time to \"bread\" them, they taste really good. I just dunk them in a bowl of water then in a bowl of flour/cornstarch mix.\n\nI'll often cook with rice and add some frozen veggies/broccoli.\n\nI'm sure more creative people would have more varied ideas. There's this, which is pretty good with tofu but as-of-yet untested with seitan:\u00a0[https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/buffalo-tofu/#recipe](https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/buffalo-tofu/#recipe)\n\nI also used a different seitan recipe to make this in the past, and it turned out delicious:\u00a0[https://www.stephsunshine.com/vegan-life/crispy-fried-tofu/](https://www.stephsunshine.com/vegan-life/crispy-fried-tofu/)\n\nI've seen some people online mention seitan having a weird taste. I'm basically a garbage disposal with no palete, so I've never noticed it regardless of which recipe/method I used. However, I've heard that adding a touch of baking powder will reduce that taste.\n\n**Price Breakdown**\n\nHere's some screenshots that I pulled from my spreadsheet. I'm in a MCOL city in the Midwest. These are the numbers from my local Kroger's and Target (the Target boycott is still ongoing for the next couple weeks, though).\n\n[Seitan Base Price \\(per serving: 300kal, 36p, 17c, 9f\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7br4uhldgtse1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cc3ac4b18e57275ae45bcb424aa097f5c858f84)\n\n[Sriracha Sauce Price](https://preview.redd.it/lrfv7ehggtse1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecdc859ab5bee101992c4cacae4ffe0cedac5669)\n\n[Orange Sauce Price](https://preview.redd.it/emqs1nwigtse1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b1d17b6a5145304dca833824975ab08b5d40e51)\n\n[Buffalo Sauce](https://preview.redd.it/iu10582lgtse1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=a759a5d2c4334cd7df37ddb98935b3357b7ccfa4)\n\nI got my VWG and Nooch from\u00a0[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Anthonys-Premium-Nutritional-Flakes-Gluten/dp/B08L448J12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8).

I've had anorexia in the past and can't go down that path again but I can't eat a good diet either right now. \n\nSo please if you know your stuff please put down what easy-ish meals I can make for myself and to add I really don't like tofu unfortunately or just never had good tofu? \n\nFor context too I was completely vegan for about a 1 year and 8 months before and it's been years since I've struggled this much. I think I'm going to say bye to animal products for good. I'm also pretty decent at anything in the kitchen cooking, baking, etc. So I'm not afraid of anything complex :) \n\nEdit: I almost forgot I don't like mushrooms either they scare me but taste good in pasta sauces lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jp9bf0/hi_im_new_and_need_advice/", "created_utc": 1743547813.0, "score": 8, "author": "Haiboyo77", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/veganrecipes/comments/1jp9bf0/hi_im_new_and_need_advice/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Creamy Mushroom and Beyond Beef Stroganoff", "selftext": "This was so rich and comforting. Definitely worth the effort!  \n  \nHonest feedback appreciated if you end up trying it :)  \n  \nStart about a cup of dried porcini mushroom soaking in hot water (enough water to cover). Once mushrooms are soft, give them a rough chop and reserve the mushroom liquid.)  \nCashew cream\\*\\*  \n1 bag beyond beef frozen crumbles, fried until browned and a bit crispy. (we cook this separately and add in later so they don\u2019t completely soften in the sauce.)\n\n3-4 shallots, diced  \n2 packs cremini mushrooms, sliced  \n4 cloves of garlic, minced  \nRosemary and thyme, minced, about a tablespoon of each  \nBay leaf or two   \nSoy sauce  \n\u00bc tsp paprika  \nCognac (\\~\u2153 cup)  \nWhite wine (\\~\u2153 cup)  \n3-4 tbsp flour  \nVegan butter  \nDijon mustard   \n3 cups broth (No-Beef Better than Bouillon)  \nPasta of choice - I like mafaldine for this but really anything would work  \nChive, parsley, and/or sliced gherkins for garnish\n\n\n\n1. Start a big pot of salted water boiling for your pasta. (We want the sauce finished and simmering before the pasta finishes.)\n2. Start mushrooms on a med-high saut\u00e9 with a small bit of olive oil in a large deep pan or braiser. Salt lightly and let them sweat out, and once their water has mostly evaporated and you start to see some browning on them, add a bit of vegan butter, the diced shallots, and porcini. Continue saut\u00e9ing until the shallots are translucent, fragrant, and the mushrooms have browned more and a fond is forming.\u00a0\n3. Add in the garlic, rosemary, thyme, and paprika. Saut\u00e9 another minute until fragrant. Add a splash of soy sauce and let cook for a minute while stirring until it smells a bit toasty.\u00a0\n4. Add a couple more tablespoons of vegan butter, and then add 3-4 tablespoons of flour. Keep mixing and let cook for another \\~2 min.\n5. You should have a good looking fond on the bottom of your pan at this point. Turn off the flame(!) and add in a healthy splash of cognac and white wine. Turn the heat back up to high and let reduce and cook off until evaporated.\u00a0\n6. Add in the porcini mushroom broth and 2 cups of the no-beef broth (to start). Add the beyond crumbles and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. It should start to slightly thicken.\u00a0\n7. Add the cashew cream until desired creaminess level is achieved. You can add a bit more no-beef broth and cashew cream in small portions to balance out to your preferences. Add about a teaspoon and a half of dijon mustard. Taste for salt, pepper, and tanginess (dijon). Adjust as needed. Let simmer for 10-15 minutes, it should continue to thicken slightly.\n8. When pasta is al dente, strain and reserve a little pasta water. To a separate pan add a couple cups of your stroganoff sauce and bring back up to med-high heat. Add in pasta and cook for a few more minutes, tossing to mix. Add more cashew cream to thicken or pasta water to thin, to your preference. Taste one more time for salt and pepper.\u00a0\n9. Plate and top with fresh parsley and chives. Sliced gherkins are a traditional garnish but optional.\u00a0\n10. Enjoy!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\\*\\* Cashew cream: \\~4 fat garlic cloves, smashed, 1 large yellow onion, rough chopped, raw cashew pieces (\u00bd to \u00be cup): simmer on low heat in a generous amount of EVOO and butter.

{"title": "Hemp & Cashew milk (+ how to buy sustainable cashews)", "selftext": "I\u2019m loving making my own plant-based milks more and more\u2014it\u2019s just so easy! This one, made with cashews and hemp, is packed with goodness. Rich in healthy fats, protein, omega-3 and 6, vitamin E, and magnesium. It\u2019s ready in minutes and keeps for 3-4 days in the fridge in a bottle. I use it in drinks, for cooking, or simply with a bowl of cereal! \n\n- cashew nuts 180 (g)*\n- Hemp seeds 50 (g)\n- water 875 (mL)\n\nSoak the cashews in a large bowl of water. If using cashew pieces like the ones I get from Umano, soak for 45 minutes. For whole cashews, allow about 2 hours.\nDrain the cashews. In a blender, blend them with the hemp seeds and half of the water. Blend on high speed for about 2 minutes.\nAdd the rest of the water and blend for another minute. Strain the milk through a fine mesh strainer or a cloth. Store in a bottle for up to 4 days.\n\n* I\u2019ve been raising awareness for several years now about the origins of the cashews I use in my recipes. Because being vegan also means being empathetic\u2014and not rushing to buy products that cause human disasters!\n\nTo recap, when cashews are shelled by hand, a corrosive substance from the nut can come into contact with the workers\u2019 hands (mostly women). This issue has been widely discussed. Some importers (like Umano in Quebec, where I buy mine) source their cashews from ethical cooperatives (notably in Burkina Faso). Their technique involves combining steam preheating with coating their hands in vegetable oil. These standards are required by the Fairtrade label, so nowadays, harmful shelling conditions have become much rarer.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a significant amount of waste in the process, as not all cashews come out perfectly intact. That\u2019s why I buy cashew pieces\u2014they\u2019re cheaper and help reduce waste. They\u2019re also super convenient to cook with and take less time to soak.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been made aware of fair trade when it comes to buying coffee and chocolate. But the same applies to cashews\u2014we can choose fair trade products that ensure better pay for producers.\n\nCashews go through an intensive process\u2014growing, harvesting, drying, shelling\u2014it takes hundreds of hours of labor, and that labor deserves fair pay. The worst part? Over the last three years, the price paid per kilo outside of fair trade has dropped by 40%! Meanwhile, fair trade pricing is always calculated to ensure a viable income for producers. Right now, fair trade cashews are paid twice as much as conventional ones. It\u2019s not just \u201ca little better paid\u201d\u2014it\u2019s twice as much! That makes a real difference, with positive impacts for the entire community.\n\nAnother thing most people don\u2019t know about the cashew industry is that almost all cashews are grown in West Africa, but many are then shipped to Asia for shelling\u2014before being sent back to us for sale.

Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, and place a light weight on top for about 10 minutes to help press out excess moisture. Once pressed, slice it into cubes of roughly 2\u20133 cm. In a bowl, combine the chilli powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the tofu, stirring gently so each piece is coated. Allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\n\n   Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the ends, and cut it into wedges\u2014aim for around 6\u20138 wedges per onion, depending on its size. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers, then chop them into bite-sized chunks of about 2\u20133 cm. Set the vegetables aside while the tofu marinates.\n\n2. Warm 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. If using cumin seeds, add them first and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Tip in the tofu cubes (along with any remaining marinade) and fry for 5\u20136 minutes, turning occasionally, until they become lightly golden. Transfer the tofu to a plate.\n\n3. Add the onion wedges, green pepper, and red pepper to the same pan. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes, allowing the edges to caramelise lightly for extra depth of flavour. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Sprinkle in the ground coriander and garam masala, tossing the vegetables until they\u2019re well coated. Add the chopped tomatoes or passata, followed by the tomato pur\u00e9e and sugar. Season with \u00bd teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste). Let the sauce simmer for about 5\u20137 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\n\n5. Return the golden tofu cubes to the pan, folding them into the sauce so each piece is evenly coated. Add the chopped fresh coriander and stir. Cook for another 1\u20132 minutes to ensure the tofu absorbs all the flavours.\n\n6.

Sometimes it shows me just one or two \u201cvegan\u201d restaurants, but if I actually go through the menus, I find tons of places with at least one or two vegan options that just don\u2019t show up in the search. It\u2019s annoying.\n\nSo, I\u2019m building a little app to fix this. You enter a city, and it pulls data from delivery apps to find all the places that have at least one vegan option, not just the ones that get tagged as fully vegan.
