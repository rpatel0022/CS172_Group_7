One guy just kept going and going, I swear he ate like 15 burgers! People were calling over their friends and family, it was wild. We were parked right next to one of the main stages, and at one point, there were more people crowded around our burgers than at the concert itself!\n\nSo, a huge thank you to all of you who cheered me on after my last post. It means a lot. If you're down to support this crazy burger dream, you can follow us on Instagram at @boogieburger.de. Maybe you could help me to drag some attention. But don't feel forced to.

{"title": "Big Mac trio review", "selftext": "Our local McD's is having a Big Mac trio thing where, in addition to the classic we know and sometimes love, we also get the jr. Mac and the Grand Big Mac. I'll briefly review all three.\n\n* Jr. Mac is basically the vanilla burger, save for the mid bun and extra patty. I was quite gobsmacked by how well it tasted. Imagine the regular cheeseburger, but made juicier by the salad and biggie sauce. Of the three, I liked it the best, but I don't think it's a good deal for the 3EUR they're asking.\n* Regular Maccie is what it is. I still think the weakest part about it is the mid bun, which makes the burger stand taller, probably to scare off predators. If you'd swap it out for an extra cheese slice, the burger would be propelled into godhood (in McD pantheon) and would happily sit along the double beesechurger. It's okay on a good day, and I only get it to stuff myself.\n* Enter the Grand Big Mac. It's the same recipe, only supercharged with Big Tasty patties and buns. There's also more sauce, extra cheese, and more salad. After finishing it, I'd say that it's better than the regular Mac, but nothing to really write home about. Basically it's the long-playing Big Mac, same sensation, only longer. The mid bun is a custom order because it was super fresh compared to the rest. Overall, I didn't hate it, but I'd rather get the Big Tasty for the same price as it has tomato, better cheese, and the faux-smoke sauce they probably source from industrial smoke stacks. The downfall of the el Grande is that it's still to effin dry.\n\nIn conclusion, these didn't really rock my world. The Jr. was a nice thought experiment, but too expensive for what it is. My favorite rare mutant Big Macs still are the triple and quad with extra patties up and downstairs. They're quite the mouthful, but they balance out the dryness of the stock biggie.

Either way, a carhop will deliver your order on a red and silver tray.\n\nWe opted for the latter (finding excuses to get out of the car is a good thing to do on road trips). You\u2019ll find your standard drive-in fare here \u2014 burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, ice cream, and shakes \u2014 along with Midwest favorites like pork tenderloin sandwiches, and Blue Moon ice cream.\n\nWe ordered the olive burger, served with shredded lettuce, mayo, and sliced green olives along with mugs of housemade root beer. At many places in the Midwest, olive burgers feature green olives mixed into the mayo so it forms more of a condiment, but here, the mayo was spread on the bun and a thick pile of olives was set on top of the burger.

{"title": "Homemade burger buns, the buns i used for chicken burgers yesterday", "selftext": "\nHello dear Viewers , today I\u2019m sharing the recipe for some delicious homemade burger buns , the same ones i used for chicken burgers in my last post. You can also make them without the eggs. \nThis recipe is apt for making 6 Buns. \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n1. 225g/  of all-purpose flour, which is roughly 1 1/2 cups.\n\n2. 1 egg. Just one egg will do the trick.\n\n3. 10 ml / 2 tsp oil, You can use any type of oil you prefer. I used EV olive oil. Use 35 ml oil if you want them eggless.\n\n4. 30g / 2 tbsp sugar, We'll need a bit of sweetness to balance out the flavors.\n\n5. 15g/1 tsp of blocked yeast, Make sure to crumble it into small pieces before using. If you\u2019re using active dry yeast then use 11.25g. \n\n6. 170ml/3/4 cups of water.\nWe'll need this to activate the yeast and bring the dough together.\n\n7. Sesame seeds for topping (optional)\n \n\nProcedure:\n\nTake the blocked yeast and crumble it into small pieces. Then, mix it with 170ml of warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbly.\n\nWhile the yeast is activating, let's mix the dry ingredients together. In a large bowl, combine the AP flour , sugar, and a pinch of salt. Mix well until everything is fully incorporated.\n\nNext, add the egg and oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until the dough starts to come together.\n\nNow it's time to add the yeast mixture. Gradually pour it into the dough and mix until everything is fully incorporated.\n\nKnead the dough for 10-15 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead it by hand.\n\nPlace the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n\nOnce the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide it into 6 equal portions, each weighing around 80g.\n\nShape each portion into a round. Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of space between each bun.\n\nBrush the tops of the buns with a little water or egg wash, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n\nCover the dough with a clean towel and let it proof in a warm, draft-free place for 30-45 minutes, or until it has doubled in size again. \nIf you\u2019re looking for some perfectly round buns then use a stainless-steel baking rings.\n\nPreheat your oven to 180\u00b0C. Place the baking sheet with the dough into the preheated oven and bake for 12 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.\n\nRemove the buns from the oven, brush them with some oil while they're cooling, and then let them rest for at least 15-20 minutes.

I think the amount of lettuce in his hamburger grew with each passing second. \n\nSince San Francisco is famous for its sourdough breads and baking products we made a batch of sourdough hamburger buns.\n\nTaking Chad Robertson\u2019s formula from the \u201cTARTINE\u201d book as our base. \n\nMade with wheat/corn/whole wheat flour and buttermilk. Sprinkled with poppy seeds.\n\nInside we have:\n\n- a single beef quarterpounder\n- roasted pancetta\n- fresh tomato slice\n- two cheddar slices\n- arugula (something different)\n- mayonnaise\n- ketchup\n- yellow onions\n- salt and black pepper\n\nTangy and soft burger buns, delicious fillings.

Using contemporary 3D modeling, food density simulations, and average burger metrics as defined by the International Fast Food Commission (IFFC), we present a conservative estimate that challenges current paradigms in spatial-food occupation theory.\n\nThe total internal volume of the Statue of Liberty (excluding base and pedestal) is approximately 3,785 cubic meters.

{"title": "Big Mac trio review", "selftext": "Our local McD's is having a Big Mac trio thing where, in addition to the classic we know and sometimes love, we also get the jr. Mac and the Grand Big Mac. I'll briefly review all three.\n\n* Jr. Mac is basically the vanilla burger, save for the mid bun and extra patty. I was quite gobsmacked by how well it tasted. Imagine the regular cheeseburger, but made juicier by the salad and biggie sauce. Of the three, I liked it the best, but I don't think it's a good deal for the 3EUR they're asking.\n* Regular Maccie is what it is. I still think the weakest part about it is the mid bun, which makes the burger stand taller, probably to scare off predators. If you'd swap it out for an extra cheese slice, the burger would be propelled into godhood (in McD pantheon) and would happily sit along the double beesechurger. It's okay on a good day, and I only get it to stuff myself.\n* Enter the Grand Big Mac. It's the same recipe, only supercharged with Big Tasty patties and buns. There's also more sauce, extra cheese, and more salad. After finishing it, I'd say that it's better than the regular Mac, but nothing to really write home about. Basically it's the long-playing Big Mac, same sensation, only longer. The mid bun is a custom order because it was super fresh compared to the rest. Overall, I didn't hate it, but I'd rather get the Big Tasty for the same price as it has tomato, better cheese, and the faux-smoke sauce they probably source from industrial smoke stacks. The downfall of the el Grande is that it's still to effin dry.\n\nIn conclusion, these didn't really rock my world. The Jr. was a nice thought experiment, but too expensive for what it is. My favorite rare mutant Big Macs still are the triple and quad with extra patties up and downstairs. They're quite the mouthful, but they balance out the dryness of the stock biggie. My absolute favourite rare mickie burger is the quad-patty cheeseburger.

HOWEVER, In-N-Out is not only the better burger-by a long shot- the value to quality ratio is insane!

Either way, a carhop will deliver your order on a red and silver tray.\n\nWe opted for the latter (finding excuses to get out of the car is a good thing to do on road trips). You\u2019ll find your standard drive-in fare here \u2014 burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, ice cream, and shakes \u2014 along with Midwest favorites like pork tenderloin sandwiches, and Blue Moon ice cream.\n\nWe ordered the olive burger, served with shredded lettuce, mayo, and sliced green olives along with mugs of housemade root beer. At many places in the Midwest, olive burgers feature green olives mixed into the mayo so it forms more of a condiment, but here, the mayo was spread on the bun and a thick pile of olives was set on top of the burger. If you\u2019ve never had one, the olives add a salty, briny flavor that\u2019s tasty.\n\nAnybody else have a place for a good olive burger?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/h1knb52o18ue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744384148.0, "score": 359, "author": "AmericanWeekender", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/burgers/comments/1jws68o/olive_burger_at_simonton_lake_drivein_elkhart/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Homemade burger buns, the buns i used for chicken burgers yesterday", "selftext": "\nHello dear Viewers , today I\u2019m sharing the recipe for some delicious homemade burger buns , the same ones i used for chicken burgers in my last post. You can also make them without the eggs. \nThis recipe is apt for making 6 Buns. \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n1. 225g/  of all-purpose flour, which is roughly 1 1/2 cups.\n\n2. 1 egg. Just one egg will do the trick.\n\n3. 10 ml / 2 tsp oil, You can use any type of oil you prefer. I used EV olive oil. Use 35 ml oil if you want them eggless.\n\n4. 30g / 2 tbsp sugar, We'll need a bit of sweetness to balance out the flavors.\n\n5. 15g/1 tsp of blocked yeast, Make sure to crumble it into small pieces before using. If you\u2019re using active dry yeast then use 11.25g. \n\n6. 170ml/3/4 cups of water.\nWe'll need this to activate the yeast and bring the dough together.\n\n7. Sesame seeds for topping (optional)\n \n\nProcedure:\n\nTake the blocked yeast and crumble it into small pieces. Then, mix it with 170ml of warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbly.\n\nWhile the yeast is activating, let's mix the dry ingredients together. In a large bowl, combine the AP flour , sugar, and a pinch of salt. Mix well until everything is fully incorporated.\n\nNext, add the egg and oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until the dough starts to come together.\n\nNow it's time to add the yeast mixture. Gradually pour it into the dough and mix until everything is fully incorporated.\n\nKnead the dough for 10-15 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead it by hand.\n\nPlace the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n\nOnce the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide it into 6 equal portions, each weighing around 80g.\n\nShape each portion into a round. Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of space between each bun.\n\nBrush the tops of the buns with a little water or egg wash, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n\nCover the dough with a clean towel and let it proof in a warm, draft-free place for 30-45 minutes, or until it has doubled in size again. \nIf you\u2019re looking for some perfectly round buns then use a stainless-steel baking rings.\n\nPreheat your oven to 180\u00b0C. Place the baking sheet with the dough into the preheated oven and bake for 12 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.\n\nRemove the buns from the oven, brush them with some oil while they're cooling, and then let them rest for at least 15-20 minutes.

I think the amount of lettuce in his hamburger grew with each passing second. \n\nSince San Francisco is famous for its sourdough breads and baking products we made a batch of sourdough hamburger buns.\n\nTaking Chad Robertson\u2019s formula from the \u201cTARTINE\u201d book as our base. \n\nMade with wheat/corn/whole wheat flour and buttermilk. Sprinkled with poppy seeds.\n\nInside we have:\n\n- a single beef quarterpounder\n- roasted pancetta\n- fresh tomato slice\n- two cheddar slices\n- arugula (something different)\n- mayonnaise\n- ketchup\n- yellow onions\n- salt and black pepper\n\nTangy and soft burger buns, delicious fillings.
