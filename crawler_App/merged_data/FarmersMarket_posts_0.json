As it's not worth it to just make a few, I made about 50 the other day for just my wife and I. Knowing that there is no way we would eat them all that night, I planned on bringing a few to my sister and brother-in-law, too. \n\nThat still left about 25 or so extra. I decided to try vacuum sealing and freezing them. This made me think that maybe I could sell them that way at the farmers market in the summer. I don't think I've ever seen frozen foods at our market before.\n\nDo you have frozen foods at your markets and think this could be feasible? Is this something I might have better luck with in Facebook Marketplace or something similar?\n\nThanks in advance for your feedback.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FarmersMarket/comments/qvnn81/frozen_jalapeno_poppers/", "created_utc": 1637112682.0, "score": 6, "author": "Resident-Fortune-405", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/FarmersMarket/comments/qvnn81/frozen_jalapeno_poppers/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I wanted to see if anyone has a few minutes to answer some quick questions to get some insights. Please be as honest as possible, the more critical, the more the system can improve. I am posting here since some of the questions are more focused on concepts with involvement with Farmers Markets.\n\n* How do you feel about taking your weekly food waste scraps to a farmers market from drop-off? Do you feel that is appropriate?\n* How do you feel about the involvement of the farmer's market in the collection of food waste?\n* Do you think it would better to use a strong reusable container for the scraps or a single-use material like molded pulp that can just be tossed into a compost bin easily?\n* How do you feel about a reward system where once you bring a certain amount of scraps you get some free fruits and veggies in return? (Thinking about incentivizing the process to get more people involved)\n* Let's assume the farmers market is the site to drop off scraps, where would that drop-off site be most appropriate?\n* (Most importantly) Do you think the farmers would want that food waste to turn into compost?\n\nAny insight or recommended changes are appreciated!\n\nThank you everyone!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FarmersMarket/comments/mfw3cu/design_student_looking_for_feedback/", "created_utc": 1617042598.0, "score": 6, "author": "Chichiblanka", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/FarmersMarket/comments/mfw3cu/design_student_looking_for_feedback/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Duck Meat Price Input", "selftext": "Hello, my husband and I are working to create a small bird farm aimed at raising and selling Muscovy and Pekins for their meat. I recognize this may be the wrong subreddit to ask but I'm trying to see if anyone has any input on what is deemed reasonable pricing for these meats. For muscovy, I'm seeing it range as 4 lbs=$70 (note this is considered a more \"exotic\" duck I think?) and Pekin goes for $9-12/lb.\n\n  \nIf anyone has any input I'd love to hear it.
