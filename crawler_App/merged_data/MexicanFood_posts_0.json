{"title": "My attempt at a Mexican dinner with friends.", "selftext": "One of my hobbies is hosting dinner gatherings with friends, where we take turns cooking for each other. I love learning about different cuisines and doing my best to honor them when it\u2019s my turn to cook.  \n\nThis time, I wanted to prepare a meal inspired by Mexican cuisine. I know how deep and diverse the food traditions are, so I approached it with as much respect as I could.  \n\nFor the main dishes, I made birria tacos and tamales al pastor. It was actually the first time any of us had tamales, and we really enjoyed them! A surprise hit was the esquites, which disappeared quickly.  \n\nFor dessert, I made tres leches cake with macerated strawberries. It was a huge success\u2014even though we were full, everyone wanted seconds!  \n\nTo drink I offered a bevy of bevvies! I got a variety of Jarritos for those not imbibing (and a splash of tequila for those who were). I also made three cocktails, including a non-alcoholic version of the tequila sunrise.  \n\nI always send a menu in advance so my guests know what to expect. I also always send people home with leftovers. Almost everything was made from scratch, though I did use store-bought tortillas this time. Living in the Netherlands, some ingredients are harder to find, but I try my best.  \n\nI\u2019m really grateful to have the time, means, and energy to attempt these meals, to learn about different cultures and to share them with wonderful friends.

I live in the south and am part Cherokee. We have a bay tree here that grows in the wild, called Sweet Laurel. The leaves, while fresh, are medicinal. When crushed, they have a minty, sweet close to licorice scent. If you have a bladder or kidney infection, you can make a cleansing tea with them and can cure the infection without antibiotics, provided the infection has not made it into the bloodstream, which normally requires hospitalization. Dry them, and use in place of bay leaves. Same subtle flavor, plus you get a medicinal herb. When making cleansing tea, use as many as you like. I use new as well as older leaves, as the medicine is more concentrated but flavor is less intense in newer leaves. As a hot tea, use honey for the sweetener. Boil a handful and cover to let steep, it will look like southern iced tea. Strain, add cane sugar to sweeten and water in a gallon pitcher and drink as you would iced tea. It is very good. In cooking, all of th comments on this thread are correct but there is one more that I haven't seen mentioned. I don't keep up with the names of this and that but bay leaves in general, help turn the bad fats into good fats for the body as well.

It\u2019ll be sticky and stuck to your hand that\u2019s means you\u2019re doing it right. Now add half the milk in and combine well before adding the rest (you might need to use more milk or less depending on your flour). Mix it for about 5-10 minutes\u2014 you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s done if the dough is only slightly sticky but soft. It should be stretchy. \n\n-now place it in a greased bowl. Place plastic wrap over the dough and a kitchen towel over the bowl. Place in a warm place for 1-2 hours and let it rise until it looks double its original size. (It\u2019s cold where I live in New Jersey rn so I had to preheat the oven to 100 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes and then turn the oven off and leave it open for 3-4 minutes to let it cool down a little. I also place the bowl with the dough into another bowl with warm water (kinda like a Maria bath)  to keep the dough slightly humid. Then place it in the oven until it rises- make sure the oven is off before placing it in though) \n\n-after the dough rises take it out the bowl and divide it into 10 (you can make 10-16 concha\u2019s just divide the dough into the amount you want.) equal portions and place them on a greased baking tray with a good amount of space between them. Spread a small amount of butter over each dough ball so that the sugar dough sticks on top. You also want to divide the sugar dough into pieces so you can place them on top of the concha dough. \n\n-now for the sugar dough divide it into 10 (make the same amount as you did with the concha dough) equal parts and roll into a ball use a tortilla press to make flat circles. Now place the flat sugar dough and press it firmly on top of the concha dough. Use a sharp knife to slice only the sugar dough to make the markings on top. \n\n-now let them rest for one to two hours in a warm spot with a kitchen towel placed gently on top. Once they\u2019ve doubled in size you\u2019re ready to bake. \n\n-preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and place them in for 20- 25 minutes until the edges of the dough look slightly golden. (I put a small pan of water at the bottom of my oven to keep it a little humid in the oven.) \n\n-and now after you take them out the oven let them cool down a bit and enjoy!!!! \n\n-sorry if this recipe doesn\u2019t make sense or it\u2019s hard to follow I\u2019m writing this down from memory lol.", "I've learned more about Mexican cuisine in a month of this sub than the entire other 48 years of my life.

But you did well for the tortilla. If you ever want to just eat tortillas but not make them go to a tortillaria. They typically are in mexican grocery stores and are sold by the pound. They are not completely handmade but are freshly made tortillas made through the usage of an assembly line.

During the summer it\u2019s a frequent dinner (along with roasted mushrooms or chicken) because it\u2019s served cold lol\n\nAwesome with a fresh tortilla, too! \n\nI wish to try it at Caesar\u2019s one day!", "My absolute favorite salad ever.  I love a nice Caesar vinaigrette as well.  I used to get That one by Newman's Own but can't find it.  Ken's makes a good one too.  Just made a huge Caesar salad this past weekend.  Didn't know we were on point!", "As a Latina who's been to Tijuana many times, I wish I knew this! Cesar salads are in my top 3 salads! \ud83d\ude0b", "Another fun fact. It was named after Caesar Millan.", "It is Mexican food regardless of where he was born. Just like Al Pastor came from Lebanese immigrants - because so many Lebanese I migrated to Latin America. In my country of Venezuela, we have so many dishes that were created by Lebanese immigrants and are considered Venezuelan.\n\nHeck, look at curry. It\u2019s British, created by Indian immigrants.\n\nBetween the natives, the Spanish colonials, and the immigrants - so many of our Latin foods came from other cultures or a mix of other cultures. \n\nCaesar Salad is Mexican. End of story. Just like New York Pizza is American, because it\u2019s not like the pizza you eat in Italy.", "Do try it this way: brush a bit of Cesar dressing onto a romaine head cut in half, on the split side.  \nThen throw that on a really hot grill for like 60 seconds and let it flare up a bit.  \nThen serve with more dressing to taste, sprinkle parmesean, and croutons. Little lemon maybe.   Amazing. You\u2019ll never not grill that bad boy. The parmesan melts a little on the grilled part and the inside of the romaine is still cool and fresh. Served the whole half on a plate with a steak knife and fork.", "The best homemade Caesar dressing: https://www.marthastewart.com/898010/caesar-salad-dressing\n\nVery easy to make, too (Martha has the best recipes but some might be put off due to misinformation).", "Yum", "Thanks.

Caesar salad has a few spots all claiming to be the first and I\u2019ve found that once a spot enters the fight, whether or not they\u2019re the first or not, they up their game dramatically. It\u2019s also the most fun when it comes to food history.", "Had it twice this past week! Kraft Classic Ceaser and sliced turkey.", "It doesn't count as Mexican food because  it was not created by Mexicans or using the Mexican culinary tradition, it's just an italian dish created by an Italian  dude who happened to be in Mexico.", "Yes, an Italian chef, from Italy, with all Italian ingredients from his home country, all of which are traditionally paired together, invented this salad in Mexico for Americans only a hundred years ago. Or, hear me out, it was a common food pairing for hundreds of years and the early 1900's was just the first time the western world found out about it from an enterprising chef and the marketing stuck."]}

We like to keep our microbiome diverse as hell.", "Yeah tbh when I learned about typical food safety techniques I was really surprised I never had gotten sick. My mom would cook in the afternoon. They\u2019d eat first and leave the food on the stove for me and I\u2019d eat late like 11pm. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to leave it out until the morning. \n\nMy buddy is super strict when it comes to time of food out. He will throw away food that\u2019s been out for an hour. \n\nI understand the strict rules for restaurants. I think at home you\u2019re probably safer though.", "It\u2019s super common in Mexican households to leave food out for a couple hours after cooking, and it\u2019s not about being careless \u2014 it\u2019s actually intentional. Putting hot food straight into the fridge can mess it up, cause condensation, and make it spoil faster. Letting it cool outside helps preserve the flavor and texture, especially with things like rice, beans, or stews that are made to hold up well. Most people also just trust their senses \u2014 if it smells and looks fine, it probably is. The thing is, if someone\u2019s not used to that kind of food handling, their stomach might react differently, but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean the food was bad. It\u2019s just a different approach that works for a lot of us.", "Yes, it is common unfortunately, but certainly not unique to Mexican culture. Lots of home cooking isn\u2019t very food safe which is why I strongly avoid potlucks. One reason I volunteer to help cook at friends/families homes is so I know how safe my food is!", "My mom is Hispanic and I\u2019m on her all the time about this shit. I\u2019ve had to tell her twice you can\u2019t cut open a pineapple and just leave it overnight with plastic on it unrefrigerated.", "My mother does this. It drives me nuts. When I go home to visit, I make her put it in the fridge or I put it in the fridge for her. She says she does it because she was told never to put hot food in the refrigerator.", "Depends, In the north of Mexico is a bad idea doing that because it gets really warm at night so food might go to waste.\n\nProbably those who say yes don't live in places with harsh weather.", "Man so many one day are gonna learn basic food safety. No we don't leave food out overnight. My partner used to and wondered why he always had a low key stomach bug. I taught him better and now not sick as much (I can't keep him from eating \"safe\" food that upset his stomach tho lol)", "Yes, it\u2019s normal. A lot had to change after I had a kidney transplant. Now that I have a weakened immune system, my family always puts food away.", "If you take a food safety course, you will never eat at their house again. I assure you. Also look up cooked rice syndrome( i think thats the name)", "Yep, normal. I made hot chocolate last night (with milk) and it got left out all night. Woke up this morning and heated it back up and finished it off :)", "I cool food down and refrigerate it, and don't like leaving stuff out. My parents will get stuff from the fridge and just leave it sitting out open for hours... ham, jelly, salad greens, roast pork, beans. No idea why.", "As a Middle Eastern, we leave food out till it completely cools.", "I married an Italian and they do the same. Example-Christmas day, family eats dinner and the food is covered but left sitting out. Come evening, another meal, same food that sat out all day.", "we do that sometimes because you can\u2019t put hot food away maybe?", "This isn't a Mexican thing just a people thing. I had friends (white) who leave fried chicken out all night. Other Asian friends leave rice out all night (which is much more dangerous than any other food)", "Yes. Or the beans will stay out on the stove overnight and my mom will just reheat them the next morning lol.", "Posole can go bad quick. If you see  bubbles in the soup before heating it, toss it. It's spoiled and it will get you sick", "It's even common in white households.  Any big special meal that occurred was left on the table covered by a second tablecloth so you could snack after the meal whenever you wanted.  I've had a very sensitive stomach (later diagnosed with IBS) and I don't know of anyone getting sick afterwards. I never did. Later all the women would put it up when people started to leave.  It still happens to this day.  So yes, in (I would dare to say) many households meals are left out all day.", "I\u2019m white. We do that at Thanksgiving, when we have cookouts, or get togethers with a lot of food and a lot of people. The only we put up is like ice cream, stuff that\u2019s going to melt.", "some might i guess. some people just leave it out until it cools.", "In college, I had two roommates. I made champurrado one day and left a note saying to feel free to grab some (I made a big batch.... out of habit \ud83d\ude05). I did notice they both grabbed some at their own time. But then I realized that I forgot to tell them it's been out for more than +3 hours.... \ud83d\ude2d\n\nIt's normal for my stomach but I forgot to consider that not everyone has a mexican stomach \ud83d\ude05 They didn't tell me they had stomachaches but I was still worried", "I think it's common with many different nationalities.\nI'm German-english, and my mom would set hot food on the stove all day or after dinner to cool before she put it in the fridge. Sometimes for hours, her casseroles, etc..", "If the food is already cooked, then I would say the shelf life for outside of the refrigerator is longer than if it were raw. Sounds like your in-laws are still alive so it\u2019s never hurt them.", "Roomie left the rice out on the counter, ate some stir fry for dinner later. Not sick", "Neither my in-laws nor I are remotely Hispanic.  My grandparents and my in-laws would leave out food aaaalllll day long.  I never got sick.\n\nI put things away, use bleach in my dish water and wipe everything down so much it is a wonder there is counter left. I got food poisoning so bad I ended up in the hospital overnight.  Bad clams.", "Same with my Puerto Rican boyfriend and his parents I have learned.  Makes me crazy", "Nope.  That's gross", "When I visited my wife's family in Vietnam they did the same, but they didn't have refrigeration.", "Also realize that meat was not defrosted in the refrigerator. It was also left out all night. You\u2019ll be fine.", "Just bring your own bologna sandwich and you won\u2019t need to worry about any bugs, or left out foods.", "That\u2019s how it is. We just celebrated Easter at my friends house all of them were born in Mexico. My family is also from Mexico. It\u2019s not uncommon to have food sit there all night to then later store it in the fridge. \n\n\nThe only food I have never seen left out all day and evening is the pozole and menudo. The lowest flame is set on it and then stored away properly for left overs the next morning.", "I mean, the only issue is the meat... Cheese and peppers and rice and beans and all that can sit out, not recommended but it happens.", "It depends on the type of food. Next question.", "THIS is another way Mexicans are the BEST!!", "I think people get stomach bugs because they are not used to the food or spices. Not because of a bacterial infection or something sciency.", "It depends on the season in my house. Winter and fall things get left on the stove. Summer we let it cool and put it in the fridge.", "My family in Guatemala City do this\u2026not dairy products \u2026but it\u2019s eaten a few hours later. I guess because it\u2019s not very humid and they\u2019re up in the mountains where it MAY  get to 82 F for 2 hours if it\u2019s warm day. I think it\u2019s not that unusual in Latin America \ud83d\ude0a", "Yea it normal, I\u2019m used to leaving it out for the day then packaging and refrigerating it up at the end of the day, depends on what it is tho", "Lol yes yes it is. Expired is also meh. Doesnt expire. Like okay.", "Rules do not apply in Mexican households. Throw it on the comal and eat it, wey. Those guts will get stronger. \n\nPro Tip: Go to the carne asada, but show up late..Not just normal \u201cMexican late\u201d\u2026 But like that one last family group always does\u2026(we all know them).. That kind of late\u2026  When the food is cold and the flies are even tired of it. \n\nThen you feast. Trust me."]}

I give the dry beans a quick rinse, put in the pot with some jalape\u00f1o slices, a bit of white onion, a bit of oil, and then set it for one hour.  After releasing the steam, I give it a stir, then add a bit of salt, stir, then let it sit for another 30 minutes to absorb the salt.  It comes out perfect every time.

I made cecina, carnitas, longaniza, nopales, and the onions.\n\nI filled a Weber chimney starter with Kingsford charcoal briquettes, and once they were all gray I put them in a pair of Weber charcoal baskets and centered them in the kettle. I put the grill grate on upside down and put the comal on top of that.\n\nFirst I put a generous amount of fresh pork lard in the comal, then put pork shoulder steaks, longaniza, and the onions in the lard and just let it go for about 30 minutes. The pork rendered out even more fat and the longaniza drippings also flavored the lard. Then I put the nopales on the hump in the center, flipping occasionally until they were fully cooked, and stacked them on top of the pork when they were done. For the cecina, I dipped them in the lard then cooked them on the center hump as well. By this point the heat had come down a bit, so the cecina cooked quickly but didn't overcook.\n\nI then took each item out, put it on a cutting board, chopped it up with a cleaver, then put it back into the lard. I took the tortillas in pairs, dipped an edge in the lard, and heated them up in the center, stacking them on top of the pork as they got done.\n\nOnce everything was ready, I made tacos with white onion, cilantro, avocado, lime, and salsa I made from roasted tomatillos, garlic, and Chile Manzano.\n\nThis was easily the best tacos I've ever made, and some of the best I've ever eaten. I also really liked having a variety of fillings, normally at home I only make one thing at a time. The cecina wasn't ideal for this application but still tasted great, and the pork steaks ended up strongly resembling carnitas, although they weren't quite as tender as the real deal. The longaniza was great, I actually got it to my preferred *bien Frito* texture and it brought a lot of flavor to the lard.

For example, there is something called \"**gringas**\" (yes, as some old Mexicans call the Americans), actually I don't know why they are called that way but they are delicious: the simplest ones are two flour tortillas (like the Mission ones, but usually homemade, on YouTube there are many simple recipes), inside it usually has beef with some spicy seasoning and a lot of cheese.  \nBut, it's no longer considered a taco, as such; so yes you should call the police lol", "Not many people realize tacos were originally called bagels", "cant be real lol wtf", "So much wrong stuff to unpack.", "Jewish tortillas what will mission come up with next?", "Kosher tortillas", "No, just no.", "Fake", "Rachel Ray must be stopped\u2026", "Mission possible", "This is unscriptural", "Cries in Mexican", "I would slap cream cheese and caramelized onions in this in a heartbeat", "Orgullosamente judio mexicano", "r/mexicanfoodgore", "That\u2019s photoshopped right?", "please send them to me", "Son mamadas", "\ud83d\ude31"]}

The cost of ingredients per taco is likely less than $1. \n\nThis also depends on the size of the taco. If they are full size or street size. \n\nOften everything is made in bulk and then assembled.

And we're still bigoted against them -- the jokes about \"Roach Coaches\" and Taco Bell all mention Gi distress, IE Enterovirus, as if Mexican food is inherently dirty.

Enjoy!", "Holy shit dude. I can see that", "Would you like a roommate in your house?", "For those asking for the recipe, here you go (the meat used in this particular post was about 5 lbs short ribs and 2 pounds ox tail):\n\nBirria Tacos\n \nIngredients\n\u2022 Meat - whatever you prefer - beef short ribs is awesome for this. Could also do a combo of 1 lbs boneless chuck roast, 3 beef short ribs, and 1 lbs oxtail\n\u2022 2 lbs tomato\n\u2022 2 white onion (one for cooking, one for serving with the consome)\n\u2022 Garlic - enough for 20 individual cloves \n\u2022 2-3 bunches of cilantro (I always go heavy on cilantro)\n\u2022 1 TBSP ginger paste\n\u2022 5 Dry Chili Ancho\n\u2022 5 Dry Chili Guajillo\n\u2022 5 Dry Chili Arbol\n\u2022 1 TBSP black peppercorns\n\u2022 1 TBSP toasted corriander\n\u2022 1/2 cinnamon stick\n\u2022 6 bay leaves\n\u2022 1 TBSP oregano\n\u2022 1 TBSP cummin\n\u2022 1 TBSP Spice Berry\n\u2022 3 TBSP kosher salt (I prefer coarse salt)\n\u2022 \u00bc Cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n\u2022 Cheese. Oaxaca cheese is the best one to use with these tacos - it\u2019s very similar to mozzarella \n\u2022 Tortillas - smaller ones, but not street taco small\n \nPre-prep:\nDo all this first to save time:\nGarlic: peal enough garlic for 20 cloves\nOnion: cut up a white onion \n2 lbs tomatoes: quarter them\nCut open chillis and destem and deseed them (5 dry chili ancho, 5 dry chili guajillo, 5 dry chili arbol)\n \nGarlic - mash them up in a pestle mortar then add 1 TBSP ginger paste and combine with garlic and mix\n \nSpice bag:\nGet a cheese cloth\nAdd the following spices to it:\n1 TBSP black peppercorns\n1 TBSP toasted corriander\n1/2 cinnamon stick\n6 bay leaves\n1 TBSP oregano\n1 TBSP cummin\n1 TBSP Spice Berry\nTie this up using twine so you have a little spice bag ready for the cook\n \n\nMarinade prep:\n\u2022 Heat skillet on stove top with some oil and add onions, saute onions till they have some color. Add tomatoes to skillet and cook for about 3 mins.\n\u2022 In a separate skillet, add some oil, and then toast the chilis - toasted, not burnt\n\u2022 Once they are toasted, add them to the onions and tomatoes, then add your garlic ginger paste to that. Add \u00bc cup apple cider vinegar and a good amount of kosher salt. Mix it all together in the skillet. Heat on medium high for about 5 mins\n\u2022 When the 5 mins is up, add everything to your blender, and blend it all together (it will be hot and steaming) (This is the base marinade used to cook the meat in to create your broth - which is also known as consome.)\n \n\nMeat:\n\u2022 Which ever cuts of meat you decide to go with, you\u2019ll want to pan sear the pieces for about three minutes per side and set them aside as you do this. \n\u2022 Once all your meat has been pan seared, get a large stock pot and put all the cuts in to it.\n\u2022 Add your marinade to the top, and then add enough water to the pot to completely cover all your meat.\n\u2022 Set it to high and once it reaches a boil, throw in your spice bag, reduce the heat and cover and let simmer for three hours. Occasionally checking your water level. If it gets too low add a little extra water.\n\u2022 After 3 hours, separate the meat from the broth, and set the meat aside. Remove the spice bag as well and discard it. \n\u2022 Use two strainers stacked on top of each other and pour your broth through them. Use a spoon to get all of it strained and throw away the leftover stuff in your strainer. \n\u2022 Remove all the bones from the meat and any additional fat that did not render down.\n\u2022 Chop up all your meat as much as possible, you want every bite to have small shredded pieces in it when you make the tacos.\n\u2022 Place your chopped meat in a bowl, cover it, and place in the refrigerator and leave over night.\n\u2022 Next, place your strained broth in a bowl and let it rest in the fridge overnight, no need to cover the broth.\n\n\nNext day:\n\u2022 Remove broth from fridge, it should be pretty solid. Hopefully there is a thin layer where all the fat rose to the top and congealed. Take a spoon and remove that top layer and put it into a sauce pan. You\u2019ll want to use this fat to fry your tacos in. \n\u2022 Remove your meat from the bowl. You\u2019ll want to heat it up before adding to the tacos. Best method is to add the meat to a cast iron skillet. Heat it up, and also mix in some broth with the meat as it is heating up. \n\u2022 Heat up your rendered fat pan.\n\u2022 Heat up your broth in a separate pan. \n \nCook:\n\u2022 Dip each tortilla in your broth and then put them on your skillet/flat top griddle. \n\u2022 Add a layer of cheese to each tortilla\n\u2022 Add your meat. Let it cook for a minute. \n\u2022 Fold the taco over like a quesadilla. Now cover your taco with your rendered fat and let it fry for a bit. You want it to be a crunchy \u201cshell\u201d with soft, moist meat when you eat them. I typically flip them a couple times to go both sides nice and crispy. \n \nServe:\n\u2022 Traditionally, you cut up onions and cilantro, add the broth to a bowl and add your cilantro and onions to it.

Unfortunately, he came about 22 years ago, and maybe it was the post-9/11 collective racism against anything remotely Middle Eastern, or just a general misjudging of Clearwater's taste for middle eastern food, but it squashed his business so he made a pivot into doing traditional Polish food.   \n\n\nI haven't been there in about 6 years because it's pretty far from where I've moved, but the food was legit... Bigos, Golonko, Mushroom+Kraut Pierogis, Kishka, and Okocim on tap.

Prepare the Tortilla Chips:  \n- Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat.  \n- Fry the tortilla triangles in batches until golden and crispy.  \n- Remove and drain on paper towels.  \n\n### 2. Make the Red Sauce:  \n- In a dry pan, toast the guajillo and ancho chilies for about 1 minute per side.  \n- Blend the tomatoes, toasted chilies, onion, garlic, chicken broth, salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano until smooth.  \n- Simmer the sauce in a saucepan for 10 minutes until slightly thickened.  \n\n### 3. Cook the Eggs:  \n- In a separate pan, fry the eggs to your desired doneness (sunny-side up is traditional).  \n\n### 4. Assemble the Chilaquiles:  \n- Toss the fried tortilla chips in the red sauce until well coated.  \n- Divide the chilaquiles onto plates and top each portion with a fried egg.  \n\n### 5. Garnish and Serve:  \n- Sprinkle queso fresco over the chilaquiles.  \n- Drizzle with crema and garnish with avocado slices, cilantro, and red onion.  \n- Serve with lime wedges on the side.  \n\n## Notes  \nFor extra spice, add a jalape\u00f1o or serrano pepper to the sauce.

Mix the Dough:  \n- In a large bowl, combine masa harina and salt.  \n- Gradually add warm water, mixing until a soft dough forms.  \n- Knead the dough for about 2 minutes until smooth and pliable.  \n\n### 2. Divide and Shape:  \n- Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and roll into balls.  \n- Cover with a damp cloth to prevent drying.  \n- Use a tortilla press or roll out each ball between two sheets of parchment paper to form a thin, round tortilla.  \n\n### 3. Cook the Tortillas:  \n- Heat a dry skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.  \n- Cook each tortilla for about 45 seconds on one side until bubbles form, then flip and cook for another 30-45 seconds.  \n- Flip one more time and cook for 15 seconds until fully set.  \n- Keep warm in a towel while cooking the rest.  \n\n### 4.

I mean, I think it\u2019s the best personally. Just curious how you came to it without ever visiting.\n\nThey look great.", "Wow these are some damn decent looking tortillas. Now you just need a proper meal to go with it.", "What is AP flour?", "I'm from Sonora and these look pretty legit. What are you gonna use them for? Usually when we make them ourselves is for carne asada tacos or just for scooping eggs and beans for breakfast.", "sorry i meant  MEXICAN  comal, not camal !", "TLDR; \nYou got the basic Sonoran tortilla right and don't need to change anything. If you want to play with your recipe start with the fat, and use finely milled flours moderately high gluten/protein. You can also make additions to the fat, liquids, or a touch of sweetness. \n\n---\n\nFirst, I think you are nailing it. The recipe and the tortillas look spot on and you probably don't need to change anything. If you find they are doughy or the texture isn't what you are looking for, play with the cook time/temp before messing with the recipe. I like slower and lower than some people personally, but it depends on your tastes and what you are doing with them. \n\nIf you want to up your game start by sourcing the best lard you can. While most tortillas out here are just made from standard commerical rendered lard a lot of people really like to use their own fats from other cooking. I know people that mix in some bacon grease (filtered). I know others that smoke pork shoulders with oak and mesquite and collecte the drippings for tortillas. It's pretentious to stress over, but it's a fun way to up the tortillas game. Feel free to play with local flavors here. You don't need to import mesquite charcoal or anything stupid. Bottom line good fat + subtle flavors from the source meat is a good thing. I've never had tallow in a tortilla, but that could also be fun.\n\nNext you can add  ingredients. Just a touch of sugar makes a less savory tortilla. Substituting a little of the lard for butter or a little of the water for milk will get you slightly different results that are all still very authentic Sonoran, but your recipe is perfect for the baseline Sonoran flour tortilla. \n\nIf you really want to go down the rabbit hole you can start getting into your flour. The basic wheat flour most commonly used for norteno flour tortillas is going to be a finely milled all purpose flour made from durum wheats. Quality brands that are commonly used in Arizona are Blue Bird and El Rosal. Tortillas are usually made from modestly priced flour, it's not something people typically get caught up in. That said I have noticed a difference in the tortillas made from regional brands of flour vs national brands. \n\nIn the Southwestern US and Northern Mexico you are going to see mostly durum wheats finley milled. Typically moderately high in protein and gluten and low moisture content. Italian 00 semolina flour is actually very similar. Maybe mix it 50/50 with the four you are already using. \n\nFun fact a very large percentage of the wheat crop from the region gets sent to Italy for their high end pasta flours. Desert durum wheat is fantastic for good pasta flours. Italian mills usually blend North American grains with Italian grains for their flour as just using the NA grain sometimes makes the posta too chewy. Because so much of our \"premium\" crop gets sent over seas these days the local flours are made with the more modest harvests that might not be as high on gluten or protein, but not long ago it all went into local flours. \n\nThere are also very boogie artisanal flours and grains coming in to market. White Sonoran from Brand's like Hayden Flour Mills or Los Poland's are good examples. It seems like there are new high end products artisanal products coming from the region all the time. Could be fun to play with, but not if it costs an arm and a leg to have shipped. \n\nDon't stress over any of this, the differences will be small. Tortillas are supposed to be a simple affordable staple food not a crazy kitchen production. \n\n\nOnce you have a great tortilla, my favorite way to eat it is just warmed with butter. Close second is a chorizo/eggs/cheese/potatos or just grilled carne asada. \n\nEnjoy! Look forward to seeing what you make next!", "Naci sure\u00f1o y yo no sabia que hab\u00eda Sonoran style tortillas, parecen unas tortillas de harina normales. Eso si se ven muy bien echesitas.", "Tex mex"]}

I learnt it from an amazing cook that worked in my grandfather hacienda.\n\nFirst you start by making chicken broth. You start by boiling a whole chicken breast with bone (this is very important because contains a lot of flavor), one white onion cut in halves or quarters, five or six medium sized garlic gloves, one carrot (optional) and half a bunch of cilantro (toss it when boiling and remove it after 20 minutes) and a generous amount of salt.\n\nFor the tomato \u201csauce\u201d. For every cup of rice I thrown in the blender 4 Roma tomatoes, half white onion, 3 large or 4 medium sized garlic cloves, a quart of a bunch of cilantro, 2 to 3 tbsps of salt or adjust to taste and a cube of chicken bouillon.\n\nYou start by frying your raw rice. She always made it in a clay pot, but nonstick is fine and after it gets some brown color, then you pour your tomato sauce strained and start frying the rice with that sauce with medium heat until it seems almost reduced from any liquid and stirring constantly. \n\nBy that time you add your chicken stock. Don\u2019t forget to throw a little bit of the broth into your blender to clean every last drop of the tomato sauce. You can add your desired amount of ratio for how you prefer your rice (dry, hydrated or sticky). For drier rice I add 1:1 ratio plus half a cup of liquid invariably of the 1:1 rice to water ratio. E.g. for 3 cups of rice I add 3 and a half cups of liquid.\n\nThen I close the lid and put the fire on the minimum. I check my rice from time to time after 20 minutes and about 35 minutes it always gets almost done. Then I just turn off the stove, stir it around one last time and then let it rest for about 15 minutes with the lid on and it\u2019s done.\n\nHope this helps. Enjoy eating a tasty arroz rojo!", "First, You need to share your recipe and cooking method. Then we can find the issue.", "I honestly think I have the best rice recipe ever, it\u2019s taken me years to perfect it. \nFirst, get yourself a good pan to work with. I only use one specific pan for my rice. \nHeat up a tablespoon or so of avocado oil, once it\u2019s warm, add a cup of jasmine rice. Only use jasmine rice! \nToast the rice until it\u2019s a light brown color, but do not burn. While it toasts, prepare your sauce. In a blender, add in 2 Roma tomatoes, 2 cups of warm water, a small piece of onion, a garlic clove, tomato knorr (maybe like a tablespoon) and just a dash of cumin. Blend til smooth. \nOnce rice is nice and toasted, add in the sauce. Bring to a boil, and taste to check if more knorr or salt is needed.\nThen turn it super, super low. My stove is electric, i turn it about as low as it can go. Cover it with a tight lid and put a timer on for 20 minutes. Do not open it.

I went to her in my 20s because I wanted to learn to cook the dishes she made that I loved so much, and I had her show me step by step.\n\nThings I see missed on here:\n\n\\-Fry the rice until it starts to turn white, not clear - on medium heat. Stir CONSTANTLY so some doesn't burn while other stays raw. Drop in some thinly sliced onions when it is halfway done. My grandma also added thinly sliced green peppers. They need to fry but not burn, so dont add them when you add the rice. Once the rice is  mostly evenly white its ready for the next step.\n\n\\- When the rice is done frying and  while the pan is still hot and has oil -scoot the rice to the edges and in the middle of the pan add tomato sauce,  or tomato paste and water. My grandma always used one of those small cans of tomato sauce. Add the whole thing.  Add some garlic at this point. Either fresh or powder. Mix in the seasoning and LET IT FRY while stirring. This is the key part. This is the buttery taste you are missing.  Just for a minute or two - mix it around. Add more garlic and onion powder if you are making a lot of rice. It's gonna smoke and smell delicious and you will recognize that THIS is the smell you smell coming out of the windows of your Mexican neighbors house at dinner time.\n\n\\- After a minute or so of the tomato sauce frying in the oil while you stir it, add a cup of water to stop it from burning. Now that you have a second  - get more water and add enough so the rice is covered, turn it down to low and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Half way through, stir it and  taste test it and add more seasoning as needed.

Prepare the Nixtamalized Masa (if using whole corn)  \n- Bring water and calcium hydroxide to a **boil** in a large pot.  \n- Add dried corn and simmer for **30 minutes**.  \n- Let it **soak overnight**, then rinse well, rubbing the skins off.  \n- Grind using a stone grinder or high-powered food processor until smooth.  \n- Beat with lard, salt, baking powder, and **pork broth** until fluffy.  \n\n### 2. Prepare the Masa (if using Masa Harina)  \n- In a large bowl, mix **masa harina, salt, and baking powder**.  \n- Beat **lard** until **light and airy**, then mix with the masa harina.  \n- Gradually add **pork broth**, kneading until you achieve a soft, pliable dough.  \n\n### 3. Cook the Pork  \n- In a large pot, combine **pork, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and water**.  \n- Simmer for **3 hours** until pork is tender.  \n- Shred the pork and reserve the broth.  \n\n### 4. Make the Red Chile-Mole Sauce  \n- Toast **all chiles** in a dry skillet until aromatic, then soak in warm water for **20 minutes**.  \n- Blend chiles with **roasted tomatoes, onion, garlic, sesame seeds, chocolate, peanut butter, cinnamon, cumin, and vinegar**.  \n- Simmer with **pork broth** for **30 minutes** until thick.  \n- Mix the sauce into the shredded pork.  \n\n### 5. Assemble the Tamales  \n- Spread a **thin layer of masa** onto each **soaked corn husk**.  \n- Add **a spoonful of pork filling** in the center.  \n- Fold **sides inward** and tuck the bottom, tying them with corn husk strips or twine.  \n\n### 6. Adapt a 29 cm Pot for Steaming  \n- Place a **heatproof plate or steaming rack** at the bottom of the pot.  \n- Add **3\u20135 cm of water**, ensuring it does not touch the tamales.  \n- Line the bottom with **extra corn husks** to prevent direct heat exposure.  \n- Arrange tamales **standing upright**, leaning against the pot walls for support.  \n- Cover with more **corn husks and a damp cloth** to trap steam.  \n- Place the lid on tightly.  \n\n### 7. Steam the Tamales  \n- Bring water to a **gentle simmer**, not a rolling boil.  \n- Steam for **2.5 hours**, checking occasionally to add more water as needed.  \n- Tamales are done when the masa easily pulls away from the husk.  \n\n### 8. Serve & Enjoy  \n- Let tamales **rest for 10 minutes** before serving.  \n- Serve with **extra sauce, crema, or pickled onions** for added flavor.  \n\n\u2014\n\n## Nutritional Info (Per Tamale)  \n**Calories:** 350  \n**Fat:** 18g  \n**Saturated Fat:** 7g  \n**Carbohydrates:** 32g  \n**Fiber:** 4g  \n**Sugars:** 3g  \n**Protein:** 16g  \n**Sodium:** 450mg", "Looks delicious!", "Bless you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Ill take a dozen", "Good job!

I can handle that. \u201cSure\u201d. Officer goes up and orders ten more tacos. Two for each of us. The chicken tacos, best I\u2019ve ever had. Turns out this taco truck wins awards at the Oregon State Fair for its chicken tacos. Chicken seasoned perfectly, avocado salsa is to die for. Same officer says \u201cdos mas\u201d. We all agree.

It\u2019s a preference thing but for our purposes we will fry them till they are crispy. Once they are to the texture you like throw in the salsa we just made. Make sure you coat all the tortillas (don\u2019t be stingy with the sauce). \n\nToppings: finish the chilaquiles with queso fresco or cotija, thinly sliced fresh white onion and drizzle crema mexicana.\n\nSides: carne ranchera, frijoles Fritos, or fried egg.\n\nHope this helps.", "\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24", "They look delish!

Some of the peoples who live in Mexico and the American Southwest have been living here, growing crops, and making food for thousands of years before the current political boundaries were drawn.\n\nNext, Mexico is a really big place with lots of distinct \u2014 but interwoven \u2014 cuisines and culinary traditions. It also doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. People migrate there, travel to other places, leave for a while and come back, etc. \n\nAdditionally, food can certainly be an important part of national identity, but they really aren\u2019t the same thing. If your grandparents left Jalisco in the 1930s and came to live in a mining town in New Mexico, they\u2019d have cooked with whatever ingredients they could get. Your family might still identify as strongly Mexican, your food at family gatherings might look pretty different from your cousins\u2019 food in Guadalajara\u2026and you know, neither your food nor your identity is *fake* just because they\u2019ve picked up some cultural trappings from the US. That\u2019ll also proliferate \u2014 your family has your white neighbors over for Christmas Eve, they learn to make enchiladas or tamales or whatever from you, their food is super similar to your food. Maybe it\u2019s not representative of what people eat in Jalisco anymore, but it\u2019s not like fundamentally compromised or inauthentic, exactly, just because of culinary telephone. \n\nAnd, I mean, people have different tastes and their reasons for cooking how they cook might not always be to serve as a curator of place- or period- accurate \u201cMexican\u201d food. Maybe you like sour cream, maybe your kids do, maybe they were out of crema at the store, maybe you use crema for tacos but sour cream for papanchas because you liked the baked potatoes at Wendy\u2019s when your family visited the Grand Canyon. Maybe you own a restaurant somewhere in the US and \u201cauthenticity\u201d sells, but so does sour cream, and you\u2019ve gotta pay the rent, so you put up that mural with Pancho Villa and the hyena (even though you\u2019re pretty indifferent to Pancho and hyenas) and you put a dollop of sour cream on your flauta (or rolled tacos or taquitos or whatever your family calls them) combo. Flautas aren\u2019t even spicy. That makes you a savvy business owner and doesn\u2019t affect your Mexican-ness. \n\nSo, sure, white Americans looove sour cream.

It takes practice. IMO they look a little wet. You want your dough to be like play dough texture not too sticky but a little tacky...I know that sounds contradictory but you'll get it. Don't give up!", "I think the rustic look makes it look amazing, and I bet it tastes fantastic!", "The reason that you failed so miserably was because you didn't follow the recipe correctly. There's also a lot of technique that can't be translated through words and it simply takes experience. My first loaf of bread well over 30 years ago was a brick. These days I can bake pretty much anything without issue. I own my own pizza oven and make my own pizzas. I own a comal and make my own tortillas. I don't think you own a comal which is the cookware design for tortillas. There are certain ways to cook certain things because of the way that it transfers heat.\n\nI think your dough might have been too wet. The quality of the ingredients matter. First off King Arthur flour is great for tortillas. King Arthur bread flour is great for leavened bread but for quick breads such as tortillas, King Arthur all purpose flour is great. The salt should just be regular table salt. Going for kosher, flaky sea salt, sea salt or all these other more chunky salts are not good for tortillas. Just regular salt without the iodine. Speaking of additions or modifications, unbleached flour only please. That means that you choose the red bag. So we got the flower, salt and then we move on to the leavening agent which should be clabber girl double acting. Nothing else even comes close. Baking powder is baking soda with an acid but the ratio of those ingredients very widely by brand. Hands down, no question clabber girl double acting is the only baking powder you should ever use for tortillas. The lard that you can use is Manteca that comes in 1 lb blocks. Some people use hydrogenated shortening. I don't see that as a good idea. Leave Crisco on the shelf. There is Crisco butter flavor but it changes the texture and even though it's absolutely delicious it's just a personal preference on my part. If you want to get specific, use backlard. There is fat that comes from the back of the pig and then there's fat that comes from the stomach area or around the kidneys. The back lard is Superior in my opinion. \n\n\nMoving on to temperature. Everything needs to be room temperature. The lard needs to be nice and soft but not melted. The temperature of your comal is critical so you need to use a thermal gun so you can find out where stove top temperature control should be set to. Right around 400\u00b0 f should be the temperature. Depending on the char level you like you might have to go up to 425 but I think 400 is a nice sweet spot. If you look at classic tortillas you can see those little circles and blobs of brown to slightly black. That is the essence of the tortilla right there. Your tortilla obviously lacks colors so you know yourself that your stove top was too cool. It also looks like you didn't use the right leavening agent. They were also rolled out way too thin in some places so it tore but that's to be expected when you're just starting out. A tortilla press can help dial in that perfect thickness and diameter."]}

You can imagine the taste like a fermented pickled tomato. \n\nLacto-fermented tomatoes:\nRinse and quarter 1kg of organic tomatoes. Place tomatoes in a fermentation jar, and add 2% of the weight of the tomatoes in salt (20 grams). Mix the salt in and mash the tomatoes a bit so they release some water. Add a weight (a ziploc with water works) so the tomatoes sit under the brine. Cover and let sit at room temp for 4-6 days depending on the temperature of your house. Begin tasting around day 4, you'll know they are ready when they are tangy and savory. They should be bubbly. When they have fermented to your liking, place them in the fridge to slow down the fermentation. \n\nBlend the tomatoes with the brine, and\u00a0 strain through a cheese cloth. The juice is what we are after but don't toss the pulp! Spread it thin on a baking tray and dehydrate it on your lowest setting in your oven. Grind it into a powder and you have the most savory umami powder that can season anything. You can store the strained juice in the freezer too for later use. \n\nClamato:\nI don't measure so add everything little by little until you get it to your liking. \n\nTo a blender add the lacto-fermented tomatoe juice, about a third of celery water (blended celery stalks that were strained), 1/2 onion, 4-5 garlic cloves, Worchestire sauce, Oyster sauce, hot sauce, and a little ketchup. Blend until smooth, use it for any recipe that requires clamato. \n\nYou don't have to use lacto-fermented tomatoes, you can substitute with fresh tomatoes.

Lol!!! \n\nSo, basically, these look delicious, but sorry, definitely not by any stretch an enchilada just because the tortilla might have touched enchilada sauce at some point. Lol!

I would be suspicious of any other recipes in that book.  \n\nMost of the time, your usual types of white rice are going to be a 2 to 1 liquid to rice ratio.  Some types of wild or brown rice might take a little more, and some dishes take a lot more deliberately, like in a risotto or a congee.  D9nt feel bad.  When I am making something, I will usually look at a few recipes for the same thing.  You will see a little variation, but the fundamental concept of the method will probably be in the same ballpark.", "Ok it\u2019s 3 cups of stock or broth that needs to be boiled/cooked down to 2 cups. The recipe calls for 10 min boil of 3 cups.you did not cook it down long enough. Once you have a 2 cup liquid to 1 cup rice bring it to a strong boil. Wait a minute, cover it, reduce the heat to the lowest setting (assuming it still simmers for the full time and your stove works properly) and don\u2019t touch it for 20 minutes.

Use a good rice like basmati, two to one ratio is fine, and don't stir (beyond initially swirling in the water) until it's dry before you add vegetables. If you're making risotto, you really have to toast the rice first at medium heat until the grains turn white, and then you add liquid slowly, a spoonful at a time, stirring until each spoonful of liquid is absorbed before adding more. If you don't toast first you get sticky mush, not creamy goodness.", "This water to rice ratio is (3-1) is how I make rice for my diabetic dog. Its intent is to be mushy.", "I never go by measurements (maybe I should). I add the rice to a pot with hot oil  fry it, add spices and fry those a bit, add boiling water/stock until about an inch or so above the rice. Once it starts to simmer I drop to 1/3 to 1/4 of max heat and leave until I see the water has dropped. I check rice for doneness. If it needs more time and I don't see much water I'll add a splash on top and let it go for a few more minutes.

I just wanted to mention that water ratios shouldn't be taken religiously and the right amount of water depends mostly on 1) the size and shape of the cooking vessel you use 2) the altitude you are cooking at and 3) the type of rice you are cooking and 4) the amount of rice you are cooking (ratio is a little misleading, it doesn't scale linearly).\n\nGenerally speaking it works best for me to pour enough water so that there is ~1cm of liquid over the rice when it's sitting in a flat layer, and to seal the pot TIGHTLY by putting foil under the lid. If you live in a high altitude place you might need more water. I live in Denver at just over 1 mile elevation and I usually need more water than most recipes specify.\n\nIf the cookbook author lived in a very high altitude place (e.g. Mexico City at 7,300+ft elevation) and was cooking a fairly small amount of rice (160g) in a large vessel, the 750mL might not have been wrong. Where the author went wrong is not clarifying that for most people in most places, that ratio is going to be too much water.

In Mexico it\u2019s a pretty common thing to do, It\u2019s actually key to make it soft and fluffy. \n\nI\u2019d say the main issues are:\n\n- The type of rice you used\n- The recipe calls for a LOT of stirring without warning how cautious and gentle you gotta be while doing it (and doing it with a fork the last time)\n- The cooking temperature was too high without leaving the rice rest without heat long enough for it to absorb the extra water\n- More than 2.5 cups of liquid were used", "\u201cBut then it calls for 1/2 onion which is basically adding water\u201d.

It says 2 minutes, but toasting the rice safeguards it from getting mushy. Also, if you used short-grain instead of long-grain then you were doomed from the start.

Don\u2019t worry about trying to force an accent as long as your pronunciations are correct.

Some advice I would give you is definitely cook your tortillas on a cast iron with some oil. It should light coat them.

I would cook them for a minute on each side on medium heat or until they turn a nice golden color, just don\u2019t leave them on where they stay fried flat.\n\nOther than that I would maybe add some sort of chili powder to you meat marinate, doesn\u2019t need to be spicy. And top the taco off with some lime. Happy cooking!", "Need to cook those tortillas.  If you use flour, just an open flame will do, long enough for each side to have some browning.

The finished talmal looked good", "I really regret not taking up my family friend's abuelita's offer to teach us to make tamales when I was younger. At the time, I was an enchilada fiend and had no interest in tamales but recently, I've grown to love them and wanted to give them a try myself. I had a lot of fun with this recipe and see how it would be great as a family activity - my family always gets together to make rum balls for Christmas, but I bet they'd be up for a change of pace this Christmas.\n\nThis recipe was taken from/u/awhq\u2019s comment on [this post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/9vbxpq/comment/e9b19kb/) which I found by googling tamales+reddit. I looked at tons of recipes and took tips from a few different ones, but this was my main base. I have edited /u/awhq\u2019s recipe below for formatting purposes and added my own tweaks in italics.\n\n**MEAT:**\n\n* 1 lb pork shoulder or butt\n* 1/2 onion\n* Crushed/minced garlic\n* 1 tsp ancho chili powder\n* 1 tsp chipotle chili powder\n* 1 tsp cumin\n* 1 small chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, minced\n\n*\\[For the spices, didn\u2019t have anything other than regular chili powder so I used that plus cumin, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt, black pepper, and chopped jalape\u00f1o + Anaheim chile, stemmed and seeded\\]*\n\nTrim excess fat off pork butt. Put ingredients in slow cooker, cover with water *\\[I covered with a root beer, Worcestershire sauce, and some liquid smoke.\\]* Cook on low for 6+ hours. Shred the meat, removing any bones or gristle. Set aside remaining cooking liquid for your chile sauce and dough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CHILE SAUCE:**\n\n* 2 dried California or Guajillo or Anaheim chiles, stemmed and seeded.\n* 1 cup broth from cooking pork, including onion, garlic, etc\n* 1/2 tsp ancho chile powder\n* 1/2 tsp chipotle chile powder\n* 1/2 tsp chili powder\n* 1/2 tsp cumin\n* 3/4 tsp salt\n* 1/2 tbsp cider vinegar\n\n*\\[Again, I only used regular chili powder and substituted the other chile powders with the above mentioned spices. And used jalape\u00f1os and Anaheim chiles from my garden.\\]*\n\nPut chiles and spices in broth and bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 minutes. Cool. Blend until smooth. Add chile sauce to the pulled pork and mix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CORN HUSKS:**\n\nHeat a big pot of water until just boiling. Remove from heat and fully submerge corn husks, using something heatproof and heavy to weigh them down. *\\[I used the lid of a stoneware baking dish.\\]* Let soak until husks are very soft (about a hour or more.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DOUGH:**\n\n* 2 cups Maseca masa harina\n* 2 cups broth from cooking meat supplemented with chicken broth or stock\n* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder\n* 1 1/2 tsp salt\n* 3/4 cup lard (you can use the skimmed fat from the meat in addition to store bought lard to make the 3/4 cup)\n* 1 tsp chipotle chili powder\n* 1 tsp ancho chili powder\n\n*\\[Again, only used regular chili powder, cumin, etc\\]*\n\nOn medium speed, beat the lard with salt, spices, and the baking powder until fluffy. Continue beating as you alternate adding the masa and broth in small increments. The dough should be the consistency of peanut butter. \n\nFor the lightest texture, refrigerate the dough for an hour and then reheat, adding a little more broth to obtain the right texture. *\\[I didn\u2019t do this part.\\]*\n\n**TAMALES:**\n\nDrain the corn husks and remove as much water as possible. Spread masa over husk. Cover to 1/2\" of top and sides and 2-3\" to bottom (narrow end). Put meat filling in center and fold one side over filling and the other side over the first side. Sides should overlap by about 1/4\". Fold bottom up and set aside.\n\n*\\[I left the corn husks in the warm water while building the tamales and only removed 3-4 husks at a time. Rather than spreading the masa, I set aside a bowl of water and made balls of masa by dampening my hands to prevent the masa sticking to my fingers. I followed this easy method with a tortilla press and some cling film.* [*Link here*](https://youtu.be/eb2BCE-INss) *In the post you can see I tried using a cut up Ziploc bag at first, but the masa kept sticking to it even after spraying it with some Pam. I switched to cling film and then the masa rolled off easily.\\]*\n\n**STEAMING:**\n\nPlace tamales in steamer, bottom end down. Pack tamales so they all stand up, but with some room in between for expansion. Steam for 3 hours or until husk comes away from dough cleanly. Dough may seem soft until the tamale cools a bit.\n\n*\\[I steamed for 1 hr 15 min as recommended by another recipe. When I pulled one out to test it, it rolled easily out of the husk so I felt that was enough time.\\]*\n\nPut a penny in the steaming water so you can hear if it gets low and you can add more water. I keep an extra pot of simmering water on the stove so I\u2019m adding hot water and not cold.\n\n*\\[I kept my kettle simmering in case I\u2019d need to use it to top up, but my water never got low enough to need topping up. Guess because I steamed for half the time the recipe suggested.\\]*", "They look awesome! It\u2019s always daunting making them for the first time. I bet they tasted great. I\u2019ve been making them on and off about 5 years now and still have not seem to get the masa recipe to taste like my grandmas who passed when I was 14.

Then again this is how they are when you buy them from people trying to make money lol. \n\nIf this method encourages you to make tamales more often then so be it!", "How on earth are you single? This reminds me of this food truck near the culver's in Decatur IL. I don't know if it is still there but if the Pope eats Hispanic food the owners of that food truck were a blessing on humanity and their food was a miracle. Saint Hood inevitably was in their future. Culvers is good as well. It was better than what Jesus ate at the last supper and then I would get me some frozen custard and gain ten lbs but totally worth it."]}

When they get soft, you start mashing them against the side of the pot, or get a potato masher and start mashing.  You want to mash at least 2/3 of the beans.

If it does come out sour, I put sugar little by little and add more jalape\u00f1os or serranos", "I'm (Mexicana) The sour comes from the tomatillo. That's one thing I try to not add to my dishes.

Blend it all together, taste  \n5. Adjust: Add salt or acid (apple cider vinegar, lime, etc) to taste\n\nNotes: This sauce is good, but some people cook it for certain purposes. If you're going to do that, you would heat a little oil, drop this sauce in the pan, and cook for a few minutes.

Once it was all done, I added some mesquite lump charcoal to the coals, and waited for the vegetables to cool and the fire to heat back up. I then made the salsa in my new molcajete (love it!).\n\nWhen the fire was screaming hot again, I put the steak on the grill with the cambray onions and Serranos and cooked them until they were done. The steak was tremendously good, flavor was excellent and since I sliced it thinly across the grain it was tender enough to eat in tacos with the molcajete salsa. The soy sauce came through just a little too much, so I think next time I'm gonna split it with Worcestershire or just use half as much. \n\nMy heat tolerance has been going up a lot lately, so I thought I was ready for chiles toreados. I was mistaken. The first one was good, but the second one absolutely destroyed me. I ended up chugging some milk, a whole beer, and I'm now sipping some Blanco Tequila to fully recover.

Then, add in 330g (approx. 1 \u00bd cups) of warm water to start with and mix together using your hands.  \n\\- Begin kneading the dough to form a ball that's sticky enough to stay together, but not coming off on your hands. Keep rolling and pressing with your palm for a few minutes (like you would when kneading bread dough).  \n\\- If the dough appears too crumbly, add a tbsp of water at a time until you are able to form a texture similar to play-dough. If it becomes too sticky, add in a little more masa harina.  \n\n\n**Rolling**  \n\\- Next, start breaking off pieces of the dough to form small balls (about 40g each). Roll each piece of dough in between your palms until smooth. You should get about 14-16 tortillas out of this recipe.  \nTortilla press  \n\\- If you have a tortilla press, cut a zip lock bag into 2 pieces that will fit into the press (one for each side of the tortilla).  \n\\- Open the press and place a ball of dough in the center on a piece of plastic. Place the other plastic piece on top and close the press down gently to form tortillas about 5 inches in diameter.  \n\n\n**Other techniques**  \n\\- If you don't have a tortilla press, place your ball of dough between the same 2 pieces of plastic on your counter. Press the tortilla down with the bottom of a baking dish or flat plate, then begin flattening it out with a rolling pin until quite thin (again, about 5 inches in diameter).  \n\\- If you don't have a rolling pin, continue pressing down with a hard, flat surface until your tortilla is the same size as the above methods.  \n\n\n**To cook**  \n\\- Preheat a seasoned cast-iron skillet for 9-10 minutes starting on low and working your way up to just over medium or medium-high. If you are using a regular frying pan, preheat it with no oil as you normally would.  \n\\- Then, carefully add a tortilla in and cook on the first side for 40-50 seconds. Flip and cook for another 30-60 seconds, or until brown spots are forming (for us, 40 seconds on the first side and 50 on the second seem to be just right in our cast-iron, but it will depend on the pan you use).  \n\\- Remove your tortilla from the heat and wrap it in a tea towel to keep warm while you cook the rest.  \n\\- When they are all fried, serve your corn tortillas warm with your favorite meals. Enjoy!", "I do 10-15 sec on first side; flip; 30-45 sec on 2nd side; flip then another 10-15 sec. After this last flip, tortilla should puff up; if not, tap lightly with spatula.

I hadn\u2019t noticed, but I\u2019m 38 weeks pregnant and only now am I noticing because I\u2019m going to their home as I could pop any day. I was making myself some light food so I could take something for my cold. His mom was asking if I was cooking for her son. I said it was for myself and my toddler. I don\u2019t wake up early to make food for my husband, again, because I\u2019m pregnant and my back hurts! Everything hurts. I\u2019m tired.

I also homeschool. I cook and clean, but lately, I\u2019m just so fatigued. \n\nI found it shocking that my in laws found it crazy that I wouldn\u2019t be cooking up a meal at 6am for him and not just for myself and the baby inside me. \n\nI see my dad in law abuse my mom in law, insulting her food and her efforts to please him.

{"title": "Question about carnitas and cooking method, what to call other of cooking pork that produces similar flavor and texture?", "selftext": "So a few weeks ago on here, I learned how carnitas is fried in a ton of lard before slow cooking. Decided to get some carnitas from the local Mexican grocery store to compare to my husband's way of cooking \"carnitas\". \n\nMy husband slow roasts a pork shoulder with all the spices and juice, without trimming fat, in a Dutch oven over four hours, then after shredding, he crisps it up in the broiler or on the stove top.\n\nBoth delicious, but both.... Taste pretty similar. I'm not seeing how either method makes the taste so different. \n\nSo not a traditional cooking method, but what are we calling my husband's way of cooking \"carnitas?\" Or even other cooking methods that stray from the tradition?  Is carnitas really just the cooking method even when it tastes very similar to other cooking methods? Roasted pork/puerco asado? \n\nThis is just meant to me a thought provoking post.

If you called any type of shredded meat carnitas, why stop at that? Instead of pulled pork, call it carnitas. Instead of burgers or sausages, call it carnitas.

In a pot melt at least a cup(these arent healthy but delicious) of whatever animal fat you want, Ive used so many different kinds but my favorites are bacon fat and duck fat, chicken fat would be great too and ive even used butter but like I said bacon and duck are my favorite. So over medium heat youve got your melted fat, add your diced onion and whole smashed garlic cloves and we just want to slowly sweat them, were not looking to get any color on them or fry them because thats gonna caramelize the sugars and make your beans in my opinion too sweet. Once your onions are properly sweated add the entire can of beans with the liquid and bring up to temp, no need to add any additional liquid this should be more than enough. while your beens are coming up to temp add a tablespoon of oregano, mexican if you got it, 2 large dried bay leaves and for this size can id add 4 toasted chile de arbols, more if you want it a little spicier. to toast the chiles you can just hold them in the flame of your burner for a couple seconds to quickly singe them, remove them stems and add to the pot along with a nice 3 finger pinch of salt and let go slowly on medium low heat just simmering uncovered for at least an hour stirring top to bottom every so often. Youll know theyre done when the onions start kind of melting away and some of the liquid has evaporated and the beans are started to peak out the top, this is where the proper amount of liquid has evaporated to give the consistency I like, if you like em thicker you can cook them longer and evaporate more of the liquid but once were done kill the heat, remove and discard the bay leaves and chiles and you can either use a hand masher and if you want them really nice and smooth ( and faster and easier) you can use an immersion blender and its also better for emulsifying the fat into the beans and getting a nice creamy smooth texture but if you like them a little chunkier id use a hand masher. if you find them too runny for your taste just let  the refried beans cook slowly on low heat stirring regularly making sure to scrape the bottom. What i like to do is make a huge batch, cool them completely over night vaccum seal them in dinner size batches and freeze them so you have them even quicker and easier when you want them. sorry i know this was a litle long winded but youll see its actually pretty easy when doing it. also using fresh beans wouldnt make it too much harder just would take longer but the canned beans are going to taste delicious when done this way and you wont even know the difference", "Adding bone broth for texture and flavor.", "Why not buy dried beans and make them yourself?"]}

You\u2019re essentially grinding stone against stone. You will always have some stone particles. This is a characteristic of molcajetes. If you have this for generations, the molcajete will be a few ounces lighter, just simply from the grinding that you have put it through over the years.\n\nSo a few specs here and there are nothing to be concerned about. The main thing you\u2019re doing with this initial curing, is grinding off all of the loose pieces to minimize how much is going to actually end up in your salsas. Once you actually start using it on food, grinding chili peppers and tomatoes, garlic, etc., the Stone on stone grinding will be quite minimized, and you will not have any noticeable particles in your salsa.", "It's made from a softer basalt than it should have been. \nBy the way, curing a molcajete is BS.  Polish it with a bit of water in it, and you're fine. Do you really think the ancients used rice, which is from Asia??? Nope.  Just polish it for maybe 20 minutes and you're good.", "Give it a go with a pressure washer, both mortar and pestle. It should shake loose the remaining material that may still be kinda loose from making it, but you will never not make it shed some. If you really want to seal the surface, you need to enamel it, as in giving it a brushing with an acetylene or plasma torch, or passing it through a ceramic kiln. I'd recommend the last one, but finding a weld shop might be both easier, cheaper and much faster (five minutes versus days). \n\nIf you decide to take it to a weld shop, you should consider preheating it. A large skillet, a pint or two of cane alcohol and five minutes should do the trick. \n\nCheers", "When you use rice, does or did it ever turn grey?", "Man, I'm not gonna lie, the angle of the picture had me thinking your Molcajete was built in to the counter, like you were some kind of space-aged Mohican", "One of the key features of a basalt molcajete is that it is \"self-renewing\", meaning that the abrasive surface never wears fully smooth, and continuing usage will continually open new pores and bubbles to expose a newly roughed up surface. That means you will ALWAYS have tiny bits of grit and dust breaking off.\n\nThe so-called \"curing\" or \"seasoning\" process has absolutely nothing to do with filling in pores or altering the surface make-up of the rock. These are common misconceptions. It's about grinding away the worst of the easy-to-break grit so your salsa isn't like eating beach sand. You can do this stone-on-stone, or you can use something like rice, or corn, or even an avocado to grind so you can see your progress. Ultimately, you're just using the two parts to wear off the worst of the medium to large chunks exposed by the manufacturing process.\n\nIt should get better over time as you grind away at the surface. The more and harder you grind your rice though, the more grit you'll inevitably bash off. At a certain point, it'll be workable for food use. If it's never getting there, there could be an issue with the quality of the materials."]}

If I asked them to make it the way they made it at home it would be the same stuff because they were all either young adults or non Mexicans working in there.

I've had the Coloradito at Gueleguetza (the restaurant this cookbook is based on) and it's one of my favorites. I was surprised when I tasted the mole that the tomato flavor/acidity was so strong, and it seemed less sweet + balanced than it does in the restaurant. \n\nThere's a few parts of the recipe that are not so clear. 1) I didn't really know exactly what I was looking for when it says \"cook over medium heat until the tomatoes change color.\" 2) toasting seeds and whole spices at the same time as toasting cinnamon and breadcrumbs - this made it hard to to see how the sesame seeds were toasting and i worried about over-toasting the latter ingredients. 3) There's no mention of when to add in the ground up sesame, spices and breadcrumbs so i added it in with the stock once i realized it was left out. \n\nI think I veered from the recipe a few times: the mole tasted kind of watery to me so i let it reduce more. And I used fennel fronds in place of hoja santa b/c I couldn't find hoja santa after visiting 4 mexican grocery stores (in LA! couldn't believe it). It's also possible I used more tomato b/c I used the volume measurement instead of the weight, but it wasn't *that* much more, I thought. And I used sourdough breadcrumbs that I had which does increase the tang a bit, but it was only 25g?  \n\nWill it taste more balanced once I eat it with something?? tortillas, queso fresco, crema. I'm scratching my head a bit, not really sure if I did something wrong or if it's how it's supposed to taste. (tomato forward?) Considering whether I should add in more of the nuts, seeds, plain bread, raisins, or just leave it alone.

{"title": "Need help making esquites", "selftext": "Okay so I recently discovered I love esquites\u2026 like I\u2019ve been walking to my local food truck everyday after work to buy my $6 cup. This has been ongoing for 2 weeks and I assume this will be a hyperfixation of mine for at least another month. So, I\u2019ve decided I need to stock up on ingredients because I can afford a $6 snack every few days, but not daily. \n\nThat being said, can someone confirm whether or not I need Mexican cream? And if so, do I need table cream or sour cream? Some recipes are contradictory. \n\nAs of now, I\u2019ve decided I need cojita, mayo (hellmans??), chili powder, limes, tajin, corn (will frozen bags work??), and garlic. I don\u2019t like jalepenos & I haven\u2019t been loving cilantro lately so I\u2019m skipping those two items. Am I missing anything? Any tips? I know this is an easy dish to make but I want to do it perfectly so I don\u2019t lose my taste for it lol\n\nEdit/update: https://www.reddit.com/r/mexicanfood/s/a4bapPPndH", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mexicanfood/comments/1k4lk16/need_help_making_esquites/", "created_utc": 1745262024.0, "score": 23, "author": "lgo21", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/mexicanfood/comments/1k4lk16/need_help_making_esquites/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Traditional esquite is made with white corn, mayo, cotija cheese, and vegetable oil spread (Parkay squeeze botttle). For spice use either Valentina or chili powder. You can experiment with different ingredients and substitutes, but using *white mexican corn is essential. Yellow sweet corn is simply not a good substitute in my Mexican opinion lol", "Just make sure to cook your corn first. I like to cook mine in butter. Everything is personal preference.  I use cotija cheese, butter, and mayo. I normally put chile on everything, but for some reason, I like my elote without it. Everything you have listed looks fine \ud83d\udc4d", "They use mayo instead of crema.", "There's no cilantro in esquites. That's a gringo thing. Esquites are made with epazote. \n\nAlso, esquites are made with butter, onion and serrano chili (optional). \n\nFor toppings mayo, cotija, chili powder, lime juice and some people add cream. Mexican cream is similar to creme fraiche. No need to add Tajin if you're already adding chilli powder.", "It's completely up to you, I do mine with only mayo, my wife's red chile sauce. You are describing one with the works! In which case the sky and your taste buds are the limit. One thing that I did notice is my wife will cook the corn, or re heat it as it comes cooked in the can, with epazote which is a mexican herb similar looking to basil. changes the flavor to better!.\n\nAs to cream, depends on what you like, I'm from baja and we tend to use a local sour cream a bit more than regular crema. Most of mexico will use regular mexican crema.\n\nThey are tasty either way.", "I have done it and compared to local esquites in Mexico:\n\n- Mexican Crema: You do need it for authentic esquites, it\u2019s what gives that creamy, tangy balance. Use Mexican table cream (like Cacique or Media Crema), not sour cream, which is too thick and tart. Table cream is smoother, slightly sweet, and blends better. If you can\u2019t find it, thin out sour cream with a bit of milk, but it\u2019s not ideal.\n- Cotija Cheese: Must. Crumble it finely for that salty pop. No cotija? Maybe parmesan can pinch-hit but isn\u2019t as good.\n- Mayo: Hellmann\u2019s (my favorite it's Best Food or Wensley) works great, gives richness without overpowering. About 1-2 tbsp per serving.\n- Chili Powder: Get a Mexican blend like Taj\u00edn\u2019s chili powder or guajillo for depth. Adjust for heat preference.\n- Limes: 1/2 lime per serving is plenty.\n- Taj\u00edn: Good choice for extra tang and spice. Sprinkle lightly to finish.\n- Corn: Frozen bags work fine, cheaper and easier than fresh. Aim for white corn. Thaw and drain well to avoid watery esquites.\n- Garlic: 1-2 minced cloves saut\u00e9ed with corn adds depth Optional.\n- Skipping Jalape\u00f1os/Cilantro is fine if they\u2019re not your vibe. You won\u2019t miss them with the other flavors in Mexican esquites. CDMX use epazote.\n\nMissing\n- Butter: Many recipes use a bit (1-2 tbsp) to saut\u00e9 the corn for that rich, street-food taste. Optional but recommended.\n- Salt: A pinch enhances everything.\n- Onion it's optional, include a small amount of finely diced white onion saut\u00e9ed with the corn for sweetness. I haven't seen this in some puestos.", "Secret of esquites is to boil your own white corn with epazote leaves, wich you can get in amazon. \n\nYou can later add any other ingredient like cheese, mayo, limon, butter, tajin, chamoy, valentina and even takis, peanuts, roasted garlic and many more.  \n\nYellow corn sucks for esquites, as it is too sweet and creamy.", "Tasting esquites is a blessing and a curse....you feel sad for those who have never had it and blessed that you have....however the curse is living with the cravings when you don't have it", "I would think the mayo they use is McCormick. It\u2019s so good.", "I too am\nObsessed!! There\u2019s a food truck in NC where I used to live that has THE BEST!!!", "The best recipe: corn, chicken legs (you don't have to eat them, they just add a ton of flavor), epazote, chile serrano (dont even slice it, they add flavor whole too), onion and garlic. Then add mayo, cotija, chili powder and lime juice."]}

A few answers that all tie into it. First,  Birria often use 1 of 3 meats ; Beef, Goat or Lamb. All 3 of those proteins are not cheap to get commercially and reliably. Beef is what we use because it's actually the easiest and cheapest for us. Second,  It takes a long time to make. You don't just throw raw beef on the plancha and get birria. It takes hours and often the meat has to be butchered beforehand.  Line cooks, especially those who know how to properly butcher are expensive these days. For too long every restaurant you ever ate at, underpaid their cooks.  Finally that's starting to change. Third, the consume. While it's doesn't cost much but that's one more thing you serve instead of just a taco. And if it's a quesabirria, that's even more labor than a normal taco. All the reasons above are WHY they are costing more.

Normally pico de gallo would not have those.", "Put it together would be a start, unless you're fancy and making a deconstructed one?", "Ok I make a good pico I\u2019ll tell you what I do.\n\nFirst decide how many tomatoes you will use, I use about one per person but you can always have some extra. \u00a0Then cut the tops off the tomato and jam you fingers in and scoop all the water and seeds out. \u00a0Enjoy getting tomato juice everywhere. \u00a0Then you chop these tomatoes pretty finely although again there\u2019s flexibility here.\n\nNow normally I am a big fan of measuring ingredients but cilantro is very difficult to weigh unless you have a very small scale, I would skip it entirely, your scale is probably not built to measure things that are very light, that\u2019s ok. \u00a0I do not weigh my ingredients for pico and I think at first you shouldn\u2019t either at first, just experiment, it\u2019s a very forgiving recipe. \u00a0If you do want to weigh then you need a small scale in addition to your large scale for things like garlic, cilantro, etc, you can find small gram scales on Amazon that are accurate to like .1 gram\n\nAnyway dice (not chop) some red onion (I like red, you could use white). \u00a0I say some because this is the hard part, these ingredients you will just look at how much tomato you have and you\u2019re going to put in some onion until it looks like good salsa to you.\n\nHere is another pro tip at this point, don\u2019t overdo ingredients, be conservative with what you put in, because you\u2019ve got other ingredients to put in! \u00a0And the tomatoes will shrink down smaller. \u00a0So in reality put in what you think is maybe a bit too little.\n\nNow do the same thing with cilantro, green onions, garlic, and Serrano. \u00a0I know you said you\u2019re not big on the spicy but it should be a very small amount of Serrano, like 1/8th of a Serrano. \u00a0You don\u2019t need to notice an actual spicy taste but it helps \u2018open up\u2019 the flavor a lot and adds a lot. \u00a0Again you should be adding a very small amount and it should be diced extremely fine so that you will not be actually getting a hot feeling in the end result. \u00a0Of course you can always add more next time if you wanted it hotter.\n\nNow you should have all your ingredients in and it should be looking like a nice balance of ingredients. \u00a0For example mostly tomato but you\u2019re seeing a decent amount of onion and cilantro. \u00a0If you\u2019re happy with that then you can move on to the final stage. \u00a0Remember here that the tomato will shrink, so be generous on the tomato side.\n\nSqueeze a lime or two into the bowl on top of the ingredients. \u00a0Also pour in some olive oil, probably a tablespoon or a half of one would do well. \u00a0Add salt to the bowl, what you want to do is look at the ingredients and add how much salt you think you need based on that. \u00a0It can be added later but it\u2019s very hard to remove so start small like 1tsp for a couple servings and work up.\n\nGive the whole thing a mix and then give it a taste. \u00a0PRO TIP TIME. \u00a0It\u2019s going to taste like shit, super harsh, but what you\u2019re tasting for is salt level and lime level. \u00a0It shouldn\u2019t be overly salty or limey but you want to make sure it\u2019s a good amount. \u00a0Add more until you feel like it\u2019s good ignoring the fact that the flavors don\u2019t seem right. \u00a0\n\nYou cover it with something and put it in the refrigerator for an hour. \u00a0When you take it out again you will notice there is lots of water, the salt has extracted this from the ingredients, especially the tomato. \u00a0Empty this water out without spilling the rest of the stuff and give it a try. \u00a0You should notice a significant improvement in flavor, add a little more lime or salt if you\u2019d like at this point but it\u2019s ideal to not have to make any modifications. \u00a0I prefer serving at room temperature so I would let it come up to temp before serving.\n\nSo try that and don\u2019t worry so much about exact recipes, I often find they are off anyway like someone just guesstimated the numbers and threw it up there.\n\nSummary of ingredients:\n\nRed Onion\n\nSerrano\n\nCilantro\n\nLime\n\nOlive Oil\n\nTomatoes (plum)\n\nSalt\n\nGreen Onion\n\nGarlic", "So I\u2019m Mexican - and live in the uk, and I made pico today. \n\nthere is no real wrong ratio with pico de gallo, it\u2019s all good and you tinker to your taste.\n\nI used today; 4 good quality salad tomatoes (Tesco finest), half an brown onion, about the amount of coriander you have in the picture (including stalks, don\u2019t worry about trimming them, just chop it up fine), 1.5 limes squeezed, and sea salt to taste. \n\nStart there then tinker with what you like - I like mine limey."]}

Go get 1lb white American cheese from the deli, or buy some \"deli American\". If you can find Land o Lakes \"Extra Melt\", get that. You'll also need a little bit of milk and some fresh jalapenos. Put about 1/2-3/4 cup of milk in a pot or pan on low heat with some finely chopped jalapenos. Don't start with a lot of milk. Once it's warm-hot, but not simmering, start adding the cheese while stirring pretty frequently. The cheese will melt into the milk. Add milk as you go if it starts getting too thick. Just make sure not to thin it out too much before all the cheese is added. Once the cheese is all melted and homogeneous, it's done. Just adjust the amount of milk for the consistency you want. I like my cheese dip somewhat thin, so I add more milk than some people might, but it's still less than you'd think. \n\nI've made queso at least a hundred times.

Skim milk works great, or just add a bit of water if using another type. Start with less milk than you think you need, and add more once it's melted to get it where you like.\n\nThen the magic happens when you add some liquid from a jar of pickled jalapenos.

{"title": "How has Mexican food changed in the modern era?", "selftext": "I'm aware of the big changes from pre Hispanic Mexican cuisine to the colonial years. But I'm curious about the trends and changes of the last several decades.\n\nFor instance, here in the US my parents have told me about food trends in the 1990s like blackened catfish and chardonnay + salmon. And in the 1950s/1960s there were dishes like Steak Diane that were popular then, but have become obscure.\n\nSo I'm wondering about comparable things in Mexican cuisine. Would a standard restaurant in Mexico have been serving considerably different things 20, 30, 40, etc. years ago?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mexicanfood/comments/1jkmwp5/how_has_mexican_food_changed_in_the_modern_era/", "created_utc": 1743023679.0, "score": 56, "author": "ArtDecoNewYork", "num_comments": 149, "permalink": "/r/mexicanfood/comments/1jkmwp5/how_has_mexican_food_changed_in_the_modern_era/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I don't remember birria tacos/quesadillas being such a big deal 20 or 30 years ago.", "I'm in San Diego and go to Baja quite a bit, as well as visiting other parts of Mexico a couple times a year.   There is a foodie culture in Baja, it is sort of the Napa of Mexico.   Trends are similar to what we see generally see in the US: farm-to-table fresh/local products, Asian fusion, more fresh seafood.  Revival of more traditional/historic techniques and ingredients.  More health consciousness.\n\nOn the US side, I see more restaurants offering traditional/regional dishes like Cochinita Pibil and Aguachile, we are breaking out of the El Torito style combination platter rut.   Birria has exploded in the last couple years.   Food trucks have more specialized menus.\n\nPersonallly, I think Mexican cuisine is underrated internationally.   It is very diverse from all the historic geographical and cultural diversity within Mexico that most Americans are not aware of.  Another strength of Mexican cuisine is its ability to integrate foods from other cultures, a good example is how the Lebanese shawarma on a spit morphed into al pastor, and the asian seafood blends well.   So I think it will continue to evolve and spread around the world as chefs continue to riff on the basic framework.", "In Mexico?\n\nThe rise of tostilocos due to food costs.

Nowadays [Marquesitas](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/59/41/da/5941da083b6fa6bc6b711506ca10cb89.jpg) are present in all major Mexican cities and each street cook gives them [his own twist. ](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/62/f2/a1/62f2a1aec8c6044da4995e9d6b59b91f.jpg)", "I think a lot of the restaurants all make all the same dishes which have melded into what is known as Mexican American.

Oaxacan, Yucatecan of course, but maybe more northern things like burros/burritos now a little more common in central Mexico (speculation: perhaps Mexicans had gone to u.s. and got a taste for them?)", "When I first got to America from Central Europe. I found myself in West Texas out of El Paso, border with Juarez, Chihuahua Mexico. The food was amazing on both sides of the border. Fast forward 5 years and my job relocated me to Central Texas in San Antonio. The Mexican cuisine was very different from that in the border. I was told it was a Tex/Mex blend of both cultures.

A majority of food that is made is kept traditional.  Yes. There are others that make more types of food non-traditional.  It's a different take on them. But still considered Mexican food.  I still make Spanish rice the way my mom made when she was alive.  And keep the same tradition with my great grandmother's tortillas.", "I grew up near Sacramento, born in 82.

Gtfoh", "The major cities definitely have, especially when it comes to plating. My family is from Zacatecas, and my mother and her family have been going to the same restaurant in Tepetongo for the last 47 years and the menu is still the same. So I think the trends tend to stay away from the small ranches and towns.", "Regional Mexican cuisine is less regional. There's always been a little cross-pollination - folks from Michoacan serving carnitas in Baja California, birria estilo jalisco in the Yucatan, mole poblano everywhere - but it seems to have accelerated. Now you can find mariscos pace\u00f1a in the lake Chapala area.\n\nThere are still some dishes that are found mostly where they came from. I haven't seen a lot of tortas ahogadas on the coast or panuchos in the north or burritos in the central highlands, but maybe that will come with time. \n\nMy guess is that there are two reasons for this: mobility within Mexico, and a bit of a Mexican melting pot effect in the US. It's much cheaper and quicker than it used to be for somebody from CDMX to go to Baja California and encounter fish tacos. And a family that moves to Sacramento from Nayarit might make friends (and share food) with folks from Guadalajara.\n\nI'm all for it so long as the regional food traditions are preserved. More deliciousness everywhere!", "Jajaja, the vast majority replying are Mexicans Americans that have few knowledge of actual Mexican food and dishes outside from the region their families are from, must of what you are talking is from food being Americanized.  There are so many regions in Mexico with it own dishes that is hard to have a good idea to see what is changing.", "Idk, to be honest.\n\nMaybe more fusion food? We have our bastardized versions of sushi and pizza.\n\nI don't think traditional food has changed a lot.\n\nsource:\n\nim mexican who lives in mexico", "In Mexico City we would see a lot of different food trends - I think that vegan and vegetarian has become much easier to find in more traditional foods (like vegetarian pozole), as well as artisan, organic and locally sourced stuff (think artisan cajeta made with local goats milk, or small batch roasted crickets with artisanal spice mixes).", "Just in the last 5 years...putting the white cheese sauce on a chimichanga.", "Less lard.", "In the Midwest, in the 70s and 80s, fast food burritos and tacos used to come with copious amounts of shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes, green onions, and black olives.\n\n\nThey still do, too, if you know where to look.

This hand pie was introduced by English miners working in Pachuca, Hidalgo in the mid 1800's and has since become a staple in the region. Popular fillings include: mole verde, tinga de pollo, arroz con leche or my favorite - hawaianno. Now, call me crazy, but I think that if you served any of these flavor combos to a British person and tried to pass it off as a Cornish pasty, they might be a little concerned about your grip on reality.

{"title": "How to get even tortillas with press", "selftext": "I started off pressing corn tortillas against the counter with a pan and usually got them pretty flat after a press or two... although it was kind of awkward and I figured a proper press would increase my efficiency quite a bit.  So I got a pretty good quality cast iron one and have noticed that it presses quite unevenly, with the side towards the hinge being thinner... so  I went to Google and indeed I see this is common and you just flip it around and press the other way, makes sense.  The thing is it still comes out kind of uneven after pressing a variety of ways, in fact if you press it between say 90 degree turns, it seems that the center gets thicker and the edges are thin.  I think I was realistically getting flatter results by pressing it down with a flat bottom pan.  This is kind of a bummer because the cooking doesn't work so great with uneven thickness.\n\nSo the question: Is this press just not good?  Does everyone just accept uneven tortillas?  How can i get proper flat even tortillas quick and easy?!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mexicanfood/comments/1jeekia/how_to_get_even_tortillas_with_press/", "created_utc": 1742328616.0, "score": 6, "author": "Admirable_Purple1882", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/mexicanfood/comments/1jeekia/how_to_get_even_tortillas_with_press/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["If it's VERY noticeable, then you probably have a bad press.\n\nBut a few things you can do:  put the masa ball as far from the hinge as you can.  flip it, press again.  then, while the tortilla is still in the plastic, run your fingers back and forth over the center of the tortilla to briefly apply pressure in the middle and sorta pooch out the high spot towards the edges.  This should take like only two seconds or so to do.\n\na larger press will also help, because you can locate the masa farther from the hinge.", "I had the exact same problem like you when I tried to make tortillas like 4x. I were like f*** it and used the leftover masa harina to make atole\u00a0", "I had the same problem. My steps to fix were:\n\nSmoosh tortilla with hand before pressing down to like 1\u201d thickness.

Good luck!", "With tortillas, you don't get even. You get mad.", "You can get quick and easy or perfection not all of the things.", "It sounds like you might be pressing it too hard, which is a common mistake. You want to use gentle pressure (think of it like using a knife: let the press do the work). If you push down too hard, it pushes the dough toward the center and the opposite edge rather than evenly flattening it, and then when you rotate it and press hard again, you're just thinning the other edge but still pushing dough toward the center. (As others have mentioned, it also helps if you flatten the ball of dough a bit with your hand before pressing.)\n\nWith gentle pressure, you'll still need to rotate it once and press again to get it perfectly even, though. But that just takes a second, and you definitely shouldn't need to do it more than once. If you still have issues after flattening it a bit and using gentle pressure, it must be the press.", "Practice and lots of it.

{"title": "My trip to Playa Del Carmen", "selftext": "1. Enchiladas en Mole Poblano\n\nI've had Mole Poblano pllenty of times in the states, but this one was the most balanced and tasty one I've had! It had a nice flavor of spices, chocolate, and maybe raisins. So food!\n\n2 + 3. Omelette + quesadilla de pollo entomatado\n\nI got a vegetable omelette to make up for my vegetable deficit and ordered a quesadilla to go with it. The quesadilla had a nice tortilla and it was  among the best quesadillas I've had so far. Just the right amount of cheese and a tasty, probably handmade tortilla.\n\n4. Taco de Al Pastor and Taco de Arrachera\n\nGreat tortilla and nice tender meats! Both had a tenderness that exceeds that of most of the tacos I have in the US\n\n5. Sopa de pollo + salbute con pollo\n\nVery good caldo and nice presentation + balance of ingredients. It came with some chopped hot peppers that I mistakenly thought were a curtido, I tossed them all in and damn was that hot! \n\n6. Torta de res\n\nTortas are very common here in New York, but I mainly only see the round ones with more ingredients (I assume to be typical of tortas from Puebla and CDMX) . This one was very good and a nice change of pace, a little smaller and less messy. \n\n7. Pollo pibil\n\nDelicious sauce and super tender chicken. This might be blasphemous but I actually prefer it over standard Cochinita with pork. \n\n8. Relleno Negro\n\nDelicious, savory sauce. Came with a stack of like 12 tortillas for one serving, thought that was a little overwhelming considering it's already a starchy dish!\n\n9. Arroz con huevo + panucho de cochinita pibil\n\nSimple but very tasty, the rice was savory like it had chicken grease in it. The cochinita was very nice too.\n\nI also had plenty of tacos as well that I didn't get pictures of. Such as some really good birria tacos I had, they had a sort of extra beefy, confit like flavor that birria tacos in the US tend to not have (they tend to rely more on chile for flavor).\n\nI'm happy that I got to try way more Mexican food than I get to in the US, but there was so much more that I wish I could have tried! Mariscos are a must next time, among a bunch of other things I had in mind.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4poup", "created_utc": 1741244122.0, "score": 116, "author": "ArtDecoNewYork", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/mexicanfood/comments/1j4poup/my_trip_to_playa_del_carmen/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Enmoladas is the way. \u2026", "Yum to all of the dishes! !   ...My fave is the Mole Enchiladas!

With that alone you could probably make most things without getting too into specialty ingredients and most stuff you could probably find at a regular supermarket, but if you wanted to you could try a Mexican grocer as well.\n\nEasy stuff to try would be: Carnitas or Al Pastor Tacos, Picadillo, Carne Guisada, Chili Colorado, Enchiladas Rojas, Tortas, Migas, Juevos Rancheros, Frijoles Charros, Refried Beans, Caldo, Spanish Rice, Elote, Guacamole, Salsa Roja, Salsa Verde, and Pico de Gaio.

My recommendation for something easy tho that's applicable to lots of different dishes (including non Mexican food) is try making homemade salsa. It's not overly complicated and get getting the different ratios of ingredients and cook time right can lead to something that only has like 5 ingredients coming out a hundred different ways. \n\nBasically if you wanna make a green salsa grab, tomatillos, jalape\u00f1os or serranos (or both), cilantro, onion, garlic and salt. You can roast them or you can boil them. You can omit the onion or cilantro if you want. You can roast some of the ingredients but not others. Really a lot of variation for only a few ingredients. \n\nFor red get some Roma tomatoes, dried Chile de \u00e1rbol, garlic and salt. And if you want cilantro. Or if you want use green chilies with the tomatoes. Or get different dried chiles. There are so many! \n\nAnd with those basic blueprints for green and red, consider mixing and matching ingredients! My personal favorite salsa is using roasted tomatillos with dried Chile de \u00e1rbol. Some charred onion, a healthy amount of garlic, salt, cilantro or no cilantro either way it's great, and a little adding of chicken bouillon is a secret ingredient that can really make it even better. There's loads of great salsa recipes you can find on YouTube but it's definitely something I recommend as being fun and rewarding to cook.

You can steam them or heat them in the microwave to serve on the side or roll up into enchiladas or whatever. Deep frying is totally optional and I only deep fry to make chips. The secret to good chips is very hot oil, and take them out as soon as the violent bubbling starts to taper off. Literally only a minute or two. If you keep going until all moisture has completely fried off, the chips will absorb oil and be greasy. I fry chips at around 365\u00b0F. Cut up the tortillas while the oil is heating up. You need it to be at least 2\" deep in the pot. Stir them around a bit when you drop a batch into the oil so they don't stick together. I shake mine in a paper bag with a little Slap Ya Mama seasoning blend. The paper sack absorbs a lot of the oil from the chips. Use nice fresh oil, not what you have fried chicken or fish in."]}

While we love the stuff we make at home or get from the market, we can\u2019t figure out how to make it taste like the restaurant, it\u2019s a completely different taste to us. And we know it\u2019s probably not authentic at all, but we are just shocked how every Mexican restaurant can make this carne asada but we can\u2019t find a recipe for it. I thought maybe it was that we eat it with their salsa or rice and beans, but we make all that at home too and the meat is clearly different. If anyone can help us find how to make more of \u201crestaurant style\u201d carne asada we would love that.

Prepare the Tripe:\nRinse the beef tripe thoroughly under cold running water.  \nIn a large pot, add the tripe, pig\u2019s feet (if using), and 4 liters of water.  \nBring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  \nAdd bay leaves and simmer uncovered for 2.5 to 3 hours, skimming off any foam.  \n\n### 2. Prepare the Chili Sauce:\nIn a dry pan over medium heat, toast the guajillo and ancho chiles for 30 seconds per side until fragrant.  \nPlace the toasted chiles in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let them soak for 15 minutes.  \nIn a blender, add the soaked chiles, garlic, onion, oregano, cumin, salt, and black pepper.  \nBlend with 1 cup of the soaking liquid until smooth. Strain the sauce to remove any solids.  \n\n### 3. Cook the Menudo:\nHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pot over medium heat.  \nAdd the chili sauce and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  \nPour the sauce into the pot with the simmering tripe.

These are awesome in stews/pinto beans were you don't want it to disappear.\n\nI prefer the more meat brands, like Kiolbasa, and use it for everything because I prefer the extra bite.\n\nWhatever you do, don't get 'Soy Chorizo' it's not cute marketing saying 'I'm Chorizo' its Vegan, so it has not fat and will f-up your pan.\n\nhttps://www.heb.com/product-detail/211193\n\nhttps://www.heb.com/product-detail/1054999"]}

You can also make a good tamale casserole with this.", "You can't make proper tortillas from cornmeal or corn flour. You need actual masa, which is ground nixtamalized corn. Nixtamalization is soaking whole corn kernels in a caustic solution such as lye, which removes the outer skin of the kernel and performs some chemical hocus pocus that makes the proteins in the corn more bio-available. whole, it is called hominy in English, or Pozole in Spanish. Ground, it is masa. In fact, a diet of nothing but nixtamalized corn, and beans, has a very complete amino acid profile and will sustain human life a lot better than most vegetable diets. Add a little actual meat and some cruciform and leafy green vegetables and you have a fairly healthy diet. But plain corn or cornmeal is not nearly as nutritious as nixtamalized corn. Plus, the texture is all wrong for making tortillas. It simply will not work very well, though you can certainly pat out corn dough and fry it. It just won't be a tortilla.\n\nThat price is pretty high but as it is imported where you are, that is to be expected. It will make very good cornbread, though. Mix it with regular all purpose wheat flour, anywhere from 50% to 65% cornmeal. Add baking powder, roughly a half tablespoon per pound of grain. Also a teaspoon of baking soda. A pinch of salt. Pre-heat your oven and also heat up a cast iron skillet on the stove top until oil smokes when you drip some into it. beat an egg or two, and add enough buttermilk or slightly soured milk to make a batter, then pour the liquid ingredients into the dry and mix quickly, swirl some fresh oil around in the skillet, then pour in the batter all at once. It should sizzle a little. This makes a skin on the bottom and prevents sticking. Bake in 435\u00b0F degree oven until it starts browning on top a little, test for doneness with toothpick. flipping skillet upside down should free it. Turn it back right side up and cut into wedges, serve hot with butter. Great with beans or stewed meat. To make a substitute for buttermilk, take whole milk and add a little vinegar. It reacts with the baking soda and the heat makes the baking powder and the CO2 created by the baking soda and acetic acid, to make it rise and not just be a doughy lump.

There\u2019s a book called Californio rancho cuisine and olives are prominent.  Anywhere in the southwest you can find olives if you look hard enough.   Every California mission had olive groves.   The reason it\u2019s more common in the US vs Mexico is because America doesn\u2019t mess with religions, whereas Mexico took active steps against Catholic Church long long ago under Juarez.
