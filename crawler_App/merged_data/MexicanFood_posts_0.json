I had been looking for skirt/flank. I don\u2019t understand why all countries can\u2019t just use the same name for everything. \n\nA salsa made from canned tomatillo (canned find fresh in Australia), jalape\u00f1o, garlic, onion, coriander, salt and pepper. \n\nI was able to get some packet corn tortillas from a local manufacturer. They were not as good as some I\u2019ve had in local restaurants.

I think I\u2019m Australia we tend not to utilise cheap, tough cuts of meat enough, so this gas inspired me to be more adventurous in that regard. \n\nI think the real hero here was actually the salsa.

Burritos are literally a state dish in Sonora and Chihuahua and also a staple dish all over Northern Mexico.\n\nMuch of Tex-Mex gastronomy was imported from Northern Mexico, but that doesn't make Northern Mexican gastronomy any less \"authentic\"\n\nThe worst offenders on this issue are mainly Mexican-Americans who believe that Burritos, Nachos and other Mexican dishes don't exist in Mexico because their family who comes from Central or Southern Mexico told them so. \n\nEven more extremist purists on Mexican food have gone as far as saying things such as:\n\n\"Flour tortillas are not a thing in Mexico\" \n\n\"Only white people believe (insert actual Mexican dish here) is Mexican\" Even though Mexicans can be white too.\n\n\"(Insert Mexican dish here) is not Mexican food because I didn't find it in Cancun/Mexico City/Vallarta\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mexicanfood/comments/trulmm/please_stop_having_purist_views_on_mexican_food/", "created_utc": 1648602204.0, "score": 227, "author": "LatteParaDos", "num_comments": 89, "permalink": "/r/mexicanfood/comments/trulmm/please_stop_having_purist_views_on_mexican_food/", "html_title": ""}

I'm used to dark colored meat,  buttery tender,  and kinda greasy. I tried making it with Chuck steak once and the meat came out really dry. Not bad,  but not the mouth feel of what I grew up eating. I figure I'll just have to hit up the taco spots until I have the time to try again.\n\nI moved to an east coast state about 10 yrs ago,  and have had decent Barbacoa since.  However,  lately all the same places have been serving \"dry\" barbacoa. I can make that. Are they just taking a shortcut making it,  or are they just not serving me the right stuff? \n\nAlso, what is a better meat to use than chuck steak? I live right next to a carneceria, so I can find it. I'm just not sure the proper word, or cut,  to ask for.

{"title": "I have a good husband, and my mil is nice, but what do they expect", "selftext": "Hello. My husband is Mexican American. He\u2019s 1st generation. His mom and dad are Mexican. They\u2019ve been in America legally for 40 years and have adapted well to American lifestyle for the most part. The only thing is when it comes to cooking. \n\nMy mom in law cooks and serves food to the men, her husband and her son, my husband. I don\u2019t mind because my husband can be treated that way when he goes to his mom. It\u2019s their culture. But i think I\u2019m expected to be the same. I hadn\u2019t noticed, but I\u2019m 38 weeks pregnant and only now am I noticing because I\u2019m going to their home as I could pop any day. I was making myself some light food so I could take something for my cold. His mom was asking if I was cooking for her son. I said it was for myself and my toddler. I don\u2019t wake up early to make food for my husband, again, because I\u2019m pregnant and my back hurts! Everything hurts. I\u2019m tired. And my dad in law was asking his son, my husband, if he was hungry. He\u2019d have his wife start cooking it up. \n\nThe way I see it, my husband, if he wanted to, he could make himself something if he wanted, but he fasts in the morning till after noon. \n\nAnd I\u2019m a SAHM. I also homeschool. I cook and clean, but lately, I\u2019m just so fatigued. \n\nI found it shocking that my in laws found it crazy that I wouldn\u2019t be cooking up a meal at 6am for him and not just for myself and the baby inside me. \n\nI see my dad in law abuse my mom in law, insulting her food and her efforts to please him. I\u2019ve always noticed that. \n\nThey are good people, with a misogynistic culture. I\u2019m glad my husband is not like that, but he\u2019ll let it slide with his mom taking care of him. But he helps me cook. \n\nAnyway, idk my in laws are in their early 60s. They are set in their ways, but is there any way I can just get them off my back a bit? My mom in law expects me to always serve myself last and eat last like her. But my husband can serve himself. I think she gets upset with herself for letting so much slide and being unappreciated. It gets me sad. For example, she has said she\u2019s never gotten flowers throughout her marriage. And even when she\u2019s been really sick, she has to make a hot plate. Things like that. Idk how to talk about it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll listen and I think I\u2019ll only offend her.

Taste pretty similar. I'm not seeing how either method makes the taste so different. \n\nSo not a traditional cooking method, but what are we calling my husband's way of cooking \"carnitas?\" Or even other cooking methods that stray from the tradition?  Is carnitas really just the cooking method even when it tastes very similar to other cooking methods? Roasted pork/puerco asado? \n\nThis is just meant to me a thought provoking post.

I was surprised when I tasted the mole that the tomato flavor/acidity was so strong, and it seemed less sweet + balanced than it does in the restaurant. \n\nThere's a few parts of the recipe that are not so clear. 1) I didn't really know exactly what I was looking for when it says \"cook over medium heat until the tomatoes change color.\" 2) toasting seeds and whole spices at the same time as toasting cinnamon and breadcrumbs - this made it hard to to see how the sesame seeds were toasting and i worried about over-toasting the latter ingredients. 3) There's no mention of when to add in the ground up sesame, spices and breadcrumbs so i added it in with the stock once i realized it was left out. \n\nI think I veered from the recipe a few times: the mole tasted kind of watery to me so i let it reduce more. And I used fennel fronds in place of hoja santa b/c I couldn't find hoja santa after visiting 4 mexican grocery stores (in LA! couldn't believe it).

Or am I just over thinking it?\n\nPlease if there are any taqueros with insight let me know. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mexicanfood/comments/1jvx2fv/nopales_in_braising_liquid_for_suadero/", "created_utc": 1744289301.0, "score": 7, "author": "Lord_Kromdar", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/mexicanfood/comments/1jvx2fv/nopales_in_braising_liquid_for_suadero/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to get even tortillas with press", "selftext": "I started off pressing corn tortillas against the counter with a pan and usually got them pretty flat after a press or two... although it was kind of awkward and I figured a proper press would increase my efficiency quite a bit.  So I got a pretty good quality cast iron one and have noticed that it presses quite unevenly, with the side towards the hinge being thinner... so  I went to Google and indeed I see this is common and you just flip it around and press the other way, makes sense.  The thing is it still comes out kind of uneven after pressing a variety of ways, in fact if you press it between say 90 degree turns, it seems that the center gets thicker and the edges are thin.

It had a nice flavor of spices, chocolate, and maybe raisins. So food!\n\n2 + 3. Omelette + quesadilla de pollo entomatado\n\nI got a vegetable omelette to make up for my vegetable deficit and ordered a quesadilla to go with it. The quesadilla had a nice tortilla and it was  among the best quesadillas I've had so far. Just the right amount of cheese and a tasty, probably handmade tortilla.\n\n4. Taco de Al Pastor and Taco de Arrachera\n\nGreat tortilla and nice tender meats! Both had a tenderness that exceeds that of most of the tacos I have in the US\n\n5. Sopa de pollo + salbute con pollo\n\nVery good caldo and nice presentation + balance of ingredients. It came with some chopped hot peppers that I mistakenly thought were a curtido, I tossed them all in and damn was that hot! \n\n6. Torta de res\n\nTortas are very common here in New York, but I mainly only see the round ones with more ingredients (I assume to be typical of tortas from Puebla and CDMX) . This one was very good and a nice change of pace, a little smaller and less messy. \n\n7. Pollo pibil\n\nDelicious sauce and super tender chicken. This might be blasphemous but I actually prefer it over standard Cochinita with pork. \n\n8. Relleno Negro\n\nDelicious, savory sauce. Came with a stack of like 12 tortillas for one serving, thought that was a little overwhelming considering it's already a starchy dish!\n\n9. Arroz con huevo + panucho de cochinita pibil\n\nSimple but very tasty, the rice was savory like it had chicken grease in it. The cochinita was very nice too.\n\nI also had plenty of tacos as well that I didn't get pictures of. Such as some really good birria tacos I had, they had a sort of extra beefy, confit like flavor that birria tacos in the US tend to not have (they tend to rely more on chile for flavor).\n\nI'm happy that I got to try way more Mexican food than I get to in the US, but there was so much more that I wish I could have tried! Mariscos are a must next time, among a bunch of other things I had in mind.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4poup", "created_utc": 1741244122.0, "score": 118, "author": "ArtDecoNewYork", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/mexicanfood/comments/1j4poup/my_trip_to_playa_del_carmen/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to bring out more of the beef flavor, or if I just need to add more spice? To best summarize the recipe given:\n\n* Warm beef shanks on medium heat until brown and tender (this took ~30 minutes while I prepped veggies)\n* Add onion (1, chopped), carrots (2,  chopped), corn (2 ears, quartered), potatoes (3 white, quartered), chayote (1, quartered), half a head of cabbage (halved again) and let sit on medium\n* Add garlic powder and cumin (she gave specifics, but I season liberally), cook until veggies are cooked through\n\nAs I kept taste testing and realizing how plain it was coming out, I'd lower the heat and end up adding more garlic powder, cumin, salt, paprika, fresh cilantro, a Goya seasoning packet, and a tomato bouillon cube.\n\nMy resulting dish was fine. It was passable. Definitely filling! But it just didn't seem to pop with much flavor despite my efforts to save it. Is plain the intention?\n\nI've got some ideas for how to improve it and add more flavor but I'm not sure if these will be effective, which is why I'm turning to Reddit. Should I sear the beef shanks before warming? Should I boil them even lower and slower? Use less water (this is a ~5 quart pot and my water damn near filled it, I could barely fit the veggies)? Add some fresh Roma tomato? Use 4+ beef shanks instead of just 2? Add the seasonings sooner in the cooking process?\n\nThe beef didn't fall off the bone as expected, which to my mind says it needs to cook lower and slower. But I'm obviously no pro cook.

{"title": "I have a good husband, and my mil is nice, but what do they expect", "selftext": "Hello. My husband is Mexican American. He\u2019s 1st generation. His mom and dad are Mexican. They\u2019ve been in America legally for 40 years and have adapted well to American lifestyle for the most part. The only thing is when it comes to cooking. \n\nMy mom in law cooks and serves food to the men, her husband and her son, my husband. I don\u2019t mind because my husband can be treated that way when he goes to his mom. It\u2019s their culture. But i think I\u2019m expected to be the same. I hadn\u2019t noticed, but I\u2019m 38 weeks pregnant and only now am I noticing because I\u2019m going to their home as I could pop any day. I was making myself some light food so I could take something for my cold. His mom was asking if I was cooking for her son. I said it was for myself and my toddler. I don\u2019t wake up early to make food for my husband, again, because I\u2019m pregnant and my back hurts! Everything hurts. I\u2019m tired. And my dad in law was asking his son, my husband, if he was hungry. He\u2019d have his wife start cooking it up. \n\nThe way I see it, my husband, if he wanted to, he could make himself something if he wanted, but he fasts in the morning till after noon. \n\nAnd I\u2019m a SAHM. I also homeschool. I cook and clean, but lately, I\u2019m just so fatigued. \n\nI found it shocking that my in laws found it crazy that I wouldn\u2019t be cooking up a meal at 6am for him and not just for myself and the baby inside me. \n\nI see my dad in law abuse my mom in law, insulting her food and her efforts to please him. I\u2019ve always noticed that. \n\nThey are good people, with a misogynistic culture. I\u2019m glad my husband is not like that, but he\u2019ll let it slide with his mom taking care of him. But he helps me cook. \n\nAnyway, idk my in laws are in their early 60s. They are set in their ways, but is there any way I can just get them off my back a bit? My mom in law expects me to always serve myself last and eat last like her. But my husband can serve himself. I think she gets upset with herself for letting so much slide and being unappreciated. It gets me sad. For example, she has said she\u2019s never gotten flowers throughout her marriage. And even when she\u2019s been really sick, she has to make a hot plate. Things like that. Idk how to talk about it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll listen and I think I\u2019ll only offend her.

{"title": "Question about carnitas and cooking method, what to call other of cooking pork that produces similar flavor and texture?", "selftext": "So a few weeks ago on here, I learned how carnitas is fried in a ton of lard before slow cooking. Decided to get some carnitas from the local Mexican grocery store to compare to my husband's way of cooking \"carnitas\". \n\nMy husband slow roasts a pork shoulder with all the spices and juice, without trimming fat, in a Dutch oven over four hours, then after shredding, he crisps it up in the broiler or on the stove top.\n\nBoth delicious, but both.... Taste pretty similar. I'm not seeing how either method makes the taste so different. \n\nSo not a traditional cooking method, but what are we calling my husband's way of cooking \"carnitas?\" Or even other cooking methods that stray from the tradition?  Is carnitas really just the cooking method even when it tastes very similar to other cooking methods? Roasted pork/puerco asado? \n\nThis is just meant to me a thought provoking post. Carnitas, along with al pastor to an extent, seems to have a variety of variations on cooking methods (slow cooker, grill, stove, oven, etc.), so I was curious was the group thought.\n\nAs always...

{"title": "Mole Coloradito from Oaxaca by Bricia Lopez - thoughts on this recipe?", "selftext": "I made this recipe last night and something about it seemed off. I've had the Coloradito at Gueleguetza (the restaurant this cookbook is based on) and it's one of my favorites. I was surprised when I tasted the mole that the tomato flavor/acidity was so strong, and it seemed less sweet + balanced than it does in the restaurant. \n\nThere's a few parts of the recipe that are not so clear. 1) I didn't really know exactly what I was looking for when it says \"cook over medium heat until the tomatoes change color.\" 2) toasting seeds and whole spices at the same time as toasting cinnamon and breadcrumbs - this made it hard to to see how the sesame seeds were toasting and i worried about over-toasting the latter ingredients. 3) There's no mention of when to add in the ground up sesame, spices and breadcrumbs so i added it in with the stock once i realized it was left out. \n\nI think I veered from the recipe a few times: the mole tasted kind of watery to me so i let it reduce more. And I used fennel fronds in place of hoja santa b/c I couldn't find hoja santa after visiting 4 mexican grocery stores (in LA! couldn't believe it). It's also possible I used more tomato b/c I used the volume measurement instead of the weight, but it wasn't *that* much more, I thought. And I used sourdough breadcrumbs that I had which does increase the tang a bit, but it was only 25g?  \n\nWill it taste more balanced once I eat it with something?? tortillas, queso fresco, crema. I'm scratching my head a bit, not really sure if I did something wrong or if it's how it's supposed to taste. (tomato forward?) Considering whether I should add in more of the nuts, seeds, plain bread, raisins, or just leave it alone.

{"title": "How to get even tortillas with press", "selftext": "I started off pressing corn tortillas against the counter with a pan and usually got them pretty flat after a press or two... although it was kind of awkward and I figured a proper press would increase my efficiency quite a bit.  So I got a pretty good quality cast iron one and have noticed that it presses quite unevenly, with the side towards the hinge being thinner... so  I went to Google and indeed I see this is common and you just flip it around and press the other way, makes sense.  The thing is it still comes out kind of uneven after pressing a variety of ways, in fact if you press it between say 90 degree turns, it seems that the center gets thicker and the edges are thin.  I think I was realistically getting flatter results by pressing it down with a flat bottom pan.  This is kind of a bummer because the cooking doesn't work so great with uneven thickness.\n\nSo the question: Is this press just not good?  Does everyone just accept uneven tortillas?

Omelette + quesadilla de pollo entomatado\n\nI got a vegetable omelette to make up for my vegetable deficit and ordered a quesadilla to go with it. The quesadilla had a nice tortilla and it was  among the best quesadillas I've had so far. Just the right amount of cheese and a tasty, probably handmade tortilla.\n\n4. Taco de Al Pastor and Taco de Arrachera\n\nGreat tortilla and nice tender meats! Both had a tenderness that exceeds that of most of the tacos I have in the US\n\n5. Sopa de pollo + salbute con pollo\n\nVery good caldo and nice presentation + balance of ingredients. It came with some chopped hot peppers that I mistakenly thought were a curtido, I tossed them all in and damn was that hot! \n\n6. Torta de res\n\nTortas are very common here in New York, but I mainly only see the round ones with more ingredients (I assume to be typical of tortas from Puebla and CDMX) . This one was very good and a nice change of pace, a little smaller and less messy. \n\n7. Pollo pibil\n\nDelicious sauce and super tender chicken. This might be blasphemous but I actually prefer it over standard Cochinita with pork. \n\n8. Relleno Negro\n\nDelicious, savory sauce. Came with a stack of like 12 tortillas for one serving, thought that was a little overwhelming considering it's already a starchy dish!\n\n9. Arroz con huevo + panucho de cochinita pibil\n\nSimple but very tasty, the rice was savory like it had chicken grease in it. The cochinita was very nice too.\n\nI also had plenty of tacos as well that I didn't get pictures of. Such as some really good birria tacos I had, they had a sort of extra beefy, confit like flavor that birria tacos in the US tend to not have (they tend to rely more on chile for flavor).\n\nI'm happy that I got to try way more Mexican food than I get to in the US, but there was so much more that I wish I could have tried!

{"title": "Advice for a tastier caldo de res?", "selftext": "Hey all, I asked a trusted family friend (un vieja abuelita) some advice on making a caldo de res, and I followed her instructions nearly to the letter, but my caldo came out pretty plain. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to bring out more of the beef flavor, or if I just need to add more spice? To best summarize the recipe given:\n\n* Warm beef shanks on medium heat until brown and tender (this took ~30 minutes while I prepped veggies)\n* Add onion (1, chopped), carrots (2,  chopped), corn (2 ears, quartered), potatoes (3 white, quartered), chayote (1, quartered), half a head of cabbage (halved again) and let sit on medium\n* Add garlic powder and cumin (she gave specifics, but I season liberally), cook until veggies are cooked through\n\nAs I kept taste testing and realizing how plain it was coming out, I'd lower the heat and end up adding more garlic powder, cumin, salt, paprika, fresh cilantro, a Goya seasoning packet, and a tomato bouillon cube.\n\nMy resulting dish was fine. It was passable. Definitely filling! But it just didn't seem to pop with much flavor despite my efforts to save it. Is plain the intention?\n\nI've got some ideas for how to improve it and add more flavor but I'm not sure if these will be effective, which is why I'm turning to Reddit. Should I sear the beef shanks before warming? Should I boil them even lower and slower? Use less water (this is a ~5 quart pot and my water damn near filled it, I could barely fit the veggies)? Add some fresh Roma tomato? Use 4+ beef shanks instead of just 2? Add the seasonings sooner in the cooking process?\n\nThe beef didn't fall off the bone as expected, which to my mind says it needs to cook lower and slower. But I'm obviously no pro cook.
