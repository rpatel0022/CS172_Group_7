Also picked my flowers the day before (4 varieties of daffodils that grow wild around here) and wore a pair of boots I\u2019ve had for many years. \n\nThe skirt and shawl I left as is to be worn again, the top I repurposed (sewed the doilies onto a bag I made from the excess skirt material and cut up the stretch ribbon to make into DIY hair ties). Overall it was a fun challenge! And the affordability was of course a big plus.\n\nIf anyone is interested in doing something similar, the skirt can be made in any size.

However, I've been disappointed in some of the responses to posts on this sub. Can't we all just be supportive?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZero waste is a journey. It shouldn't be done cold turkey (reduce, ***reuse***, recycle) and I think anyone coming here proud of their accomplishments should be supported, however small they may be. If someone has made the switch to shampoo bars, instead of admonishing them for buying online maybe we should congratulate them for making the switch?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we have suggestions, can't we say it nicely?\n\n\"I love shampoo bars! I buy mine at my local health food store, have you checked yours? They may carry some so you don't have to pay for shipping!\" \"I've tried that brand! I wasn't a fan though because it left a lot of soap scum in my hair. Try this other brand, they also ship in 100% recyclable materials!\"\n\n\"Good for you for finding a sustainable option for buying milk. I make my own oat milk, but if I ever had to buy cow's milk I'm glad I know there's a sustainable option. Let me know if you'd like my recipe!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe, as a community, should be SUPPORTING people for making steps to live a more sustainable life, NOT tearing them down because they aren't making the same choices you would be. There's a way to make suggestions in a supportive way. Some people still want to eat dairy and meat. Some people want to go vegan. Ultimately it's their choice and we should provide support and advice to them (if they ask for it) to live their lives **the way they choose to.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: GOLD???? Thank you, kind redditor! I will be sure to pay it forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Some of these discussions have turned into veganism and the carbon footprint of animal products. While I don't deny that animal products are not the most sustainable food you can eat, I think we should remember the essence of this post- we should be encouraging others to make steps in the right direction!

Become a voter Nov. 6, and show lawmakers that voters care about the environment!", "selftext": "As you may have noticed, [politicians really don't care what **non-voters** want -- they *do*, however, care what **voters** want](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x). That means if you want those in power to act in your interests, you need to [vote](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/). \n\nAlgorithms are really powerful tools to figure with increasing accuracy what people like and want. If [the Environmental Voter Project can write an algorithm with 89% accuracy to figure out if you care about the environment or climate change](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf), then so can politicians. [Nathaniel Stinnett argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U) that the reason climate change didn't end up in the 2016 debates is because of the anemic turnout among environmentalists (because too few voters prioritize the environment or climate change, but that's *not* because too few Americans do). If we want politicians to care about the environment, we need to show up to show them that it's worth their while. [This approach seems to be working](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/29/18022736/2018-midterm-elections-climate-change-voters-guide).\n\nThe number of people who say climate change is extremely important to them, personally, [is at an all-time high](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/public-support-climate-policy-remains-strong).  So let's not squander this opportunity. With [~15 million superenvironmentalists across the U.S. not voting](https://thinkprogress.org/15-million-super-environmentalists-dont-vote-in-the-midterms/), we could truly be a force to be reckoned with and make demands of those in power if only we showed up. \n\nIf, [like many millenials](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/millennial-voters-2018-midterms-climate-change-gerontocracy-survey-polls-turnout.html), you don't feel you know enough to vote well, YSK [you can download a sample ballot](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) ahead of the election and do your research from the comfort of your home. There are some great resources to help you research candidates and issues, including [ISideWith](https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz), [BallotReady](https://www.ballotready.org/), [Vote411](https://www.vote411.org/ballot), [VoteSmart](https://voteeasy.votesmart.org/), [Vote Save America](https://votesaveamerica.com/ballot), [Climate Voter's Guide](https://voteclimatepac.org/voters-guide/), etc. \n\nIn [several states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx), you can both vote *and* register tomorrow, so if you're not registered please check there. If you encounter any administrative roadblocks while trying to vote, [you have a legal right to vote via provisional ballot](https://www.eac.gov/about/help-america-vote-act/). Find the rules for voting via provisional ballot in your state [here](https://ballotpedia.org/State_by_State_Provisional_Ballot_Laws), and common pitfalls to avoid [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/provisional-ballots.aspx#Accept/Reject). \n\nOnce you've voted, [start to hold your friends accountable](https://votewithme.us/). Social pressure [is an effective tool for getting people to turn out](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080313124403.htm), and [even just posting on Facebook can have a really big effect on turnout, not just on *your* friends, but *their* friends, and *their* friends](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834737/) (just make sure to post early enough that your friends and family will still have time to go vote after being influenced by you!). So share that you've voted on social media and let the people who know you know voting is powerful tool for those who prioritize the environment.\n\nWith that, please [download your sample ballot](https://www.ballotready.org/) now and make sure you're ready to vote at [the earliest opportunity](https://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/).

They were bullshitting. I can fill up my reusable bag with the equivalent of like 3 to 5 single use plastic ones. Most reusable bags are built in a cube/rectangular shape, meaning it can freaking hold more. The single use plastic are so flimsy and small it can hold only a couple items before its stretched to its limit.\n\nIt's not 100 uses to offset one single. It's like 25 to 50 uses to offset a single bag cause id be using way more single use plastic if I didnt. \n\nLike they're technically right, it would be 100 uses...if you used a reusable bag like you do a plastic one.

At the end of the day, if someone is making a concious effort to reduce their waste it should be celebrated. We all have room to improve and no one is perfect.\n\nEDIT: Wow this was so much better recieved than I could've ever hoped for! I'm glad so many of us feel the same way. Also thanks for the silver!

{"title": "Buying junk for Christmas is NOT as religious duty", "selftext": "This short essay by C. S. Lewis originally appeared in Twentieth Century 162 (December 1957): 517\u201318, reprinted in God in the Dock: Essays on Theology and Ethics (ed. Walter Hooper; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2014), 338\u201340. h/t Anne Gahan\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nThree things go by the name of Christmas. One is a religious festival. This is important and obligatory for Christians; but as it can be of no interest to anyone else, I shall naturally say no more about it here. The second (it has complex historical connections with the first, but we needn\u2019t go into them) is a popular holiday, an occasion for merry-making and hospitality. If it were my business to have a \u2018view\u2019 on this, I should say that I much approve of merry-making. But what I approve of much more is everybody minding his own business. I see no reason why I should volunteer views as to how other people should spend their own money in their own leisure among their own friends. It is highly probable that they want my advice on such matters as little as I want theirs. But the third thing called Christmas is unfortunately everyone\u2019s business.\n\nI mean of course the commercial racket. The interchange of presents was a very small ingredient in the older English festivity. Mr Pickwick took a cod with him to Dingley Dell; the reformed Scrooge ordered a turkey for his clerk; lovers sent love gifts; toys and fruit were given to children. But the idea that not only all friends but even all acquaintances should give one another presents, or at least send one another cards, is quite modern and has been forced upon us by the shopkeepers. Neither of these circumstances is in itself a reason for condemning it. I condemn it on the following grounds.\n\n1. It gives on the whole much more pain than pleasure. You have only to stay over Christmas with a family who seriously try to \u2018keep\u2019 it (in its third, or commercial, aspect) in order to see that the thing is a nightmare. Long before December 25th everyone is worn out \u2014 physically worn out by weeks of daily struggle in overcrowded shops, mentally worn out by the effort to remember all the right recipients and to think out suitable gifts for them. They are in no trim for merry-making; much less (if they should want to) to take part in a religious act. They look far more as if there had been a long illness in the house.\n\n2. Most of it is involuntary. The modern rule is that anyone can force you to give him a present by sending you a quite unprovoked present of his own. It is almost a blackmail. Who has not heard the wail of despair, and indeed of resentment, when, at the last moment, just as everyone hoped that the nuisance was over for one more year, the unwanted gift from Mrs Busy (whom we hardly remember) flops unwelcomed through the letter-box, and back to the dreadful shops one of us has to go?\n\n3. Things are given as presents which no mortal ever bought for himself\u2014gaudy and useless gadgets, \u2018novelties\u2019 because no one was ever fool enough to make their like before. Have we really no better use for materials and for human skill and time than to spend them on all this rubbish?\n\n4. The nuisance. For after all, during the racket we still have all our ordinary and necessary shopping to do, and the racket trebles the labour of it.\n\nWe are told that the whole dreary business must go on because it is good for trade. It is in fact merely one annual symptom of that lunatic condition of our country, and indeed of the world, in which everyone lives by persuading everyone else to buy things. I don\u2019t know the way out. But can it really be my duty to buy and receive masses of junk every winter just to help the shopkeepers? If the worst comes to the worst I\u2019d sooner give them money for nothing and write it off as a charity. For nothing? Why, better for nothing than for a nuisance.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/63meejavsw5a1.jpg", "created_utc": 1671025541.0, "score": 2474, "author": "None", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/zlrc7x/buying_junk_for_christmas_is_not_as_religious_duty/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Are you stinky too? ", "selftext": "This is a rant and just know that I don\u2019t actually have an antiperspirant recommendation, ha!:\n\nI\u2019ve been on my zero-waste journey for about a year now, and this community has been so helpful. I wanted to share a recommendation in case anyone hasn\u2019t tried this trick (which is apparently very popular and I just live under a rock)!\n\nWhen it comes to health and beauty products, I\u2019ve noticed companies often group sustainable packaging with \u201call-natural\u201d ingredients, but that\u2019s not always what I\u2019m after (e.g., I want zero-waste toothpaste, but I\u2019ll take all the fluoride!). Anyway, I digress.\n\nI\u2019ve been hunting for a zero-waste antiperspirant (because I THOUGHT I needed something with aluminum because of the BO) but most options are either in plastic or just deodorant. However, a dermatologist friend told me odor comes from bacteria, not sweat, and suggested using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution on my underarms before applying my zero-waste deodorant that I claimed doesn\u2019t work. To my surprise, it worked SO well (no stink even after CrossFit)!\n\nNow\u2026 just know that the bottle is plastic BUT recyclable, and The Ordinary claims 85-100% of their packaging is refillable, reusable, recycled, or recoverable. They also offer in-store recycling, and the bottle can be easily repurposed (my kids use it for \u201cscience experiments\u201d). Moreover, if this is how you are using it, the product should last you a very long time. \n\nHope this helps my fellow stinkers!\n\nP.S. I didn\u2019t continue my search for a zero-waste antiperspirant simply because my Derm friend also told me that while aluminum is totally safe, it WILL cause those annoying yellow pit stains.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/chzbd5lgzcee1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1737470371.0, "score": 2391, "author": "ExtentEfficient2669", "num_comments": 235, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1i6k093/are_you_stinky_too/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What Fussy deodorant do you have?", "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI'm new to this subreddit and the refill/natural deo journey, so here I am searching for advise! A little bit of context:\n\nDue to sensory issues, I'm very picky about deodorants. I can only use deo sticks (preferably not cream, as dry as possible) and I find it hard to find them in stores, even worse to find perfume free ones (Denmark, EU). I've been looking at switching over to a refillable deo stick for a long time now due to these two points + the wish for a more sustainable choice. I don't wear deo often but wants to be better at using it (i don't sweat or smell a lot, but new job makes me sweat more). My current deo, the only one I've tolerated and loved, is starting to smell weird and I can't get it anywhere anymore. So it's time to take the leap for a more sustainable choice that hopefully ticks my boxes.\n\nI used to look at Wild, but read much back and forth with it being good for some, but others hating it or saying it doesn't work. Now that they've been bought by Unilever (and them generally advertising a lot of limited cases all the time, promoting impulsive overconsumption) I've discovered Fussy. Their cases are not as pretty and unique as the Wild cases, but they overall get higher praise with (what appears to be) higher success rate for people. \n\nI have ADHD and I love things that spark joy and look pretty. It helps me remember to use it and enjoy using it. I've tried my best to look up realistic pictures of the different case colors, in real lighting - not overexposed and lightened, but can't find much. \n\nSo to the real question: What case do you have? I would love to see real pictures from you guys, of how they look in bad lighting, sunlight, normal light, any light. I don't know if you can comment photos, so even just a description of how the colors actually look would be nice. I would hate to order a case and not be happy with it, and end up forgetting it exists in my drawer. I've been most drawn to the lilac and mint green, but all photos are welcome! <3 Also if you have any feedback on the fussy, their scents, other brands (shipping within EU) or other tips - please do share! Again, I'm new to this subreddit and the natural deo, so any advice is much appreciated <3 Thank you!\n\n  \nAlso, do you have any experience with their normal deo scents vs sensitive?

{"title": "I put together a station where my Recycling Center's Swap Shed can give away laptop chargers (pulled from ewaste or donated)", "selftext": "So a few months ago I was digging through a corporate ewaste bin and found laptop chargers. Tons of them (or at least enough to fill around eight shopping bags). All brand new, many still in their packaging.\n\nIt turns out that a company had a supply of \"loaner\" chargers to hand out to people who forgot theirs, but got sick of them taking up space in the office and dumped them.\n\nI hauled them all home and offered them up on my local Everything is Free Page. I was able to give a bunch away but it was pretty inconvenient for everyone involved. (Normally giving working ewaste away is pretty quick and easy here.) I kept thinking if I had the space I could set up a Little Free Library but for laptop chargers. So I asked if anyone on the group knew a way we could do that and someone who volunteers at the Recycling Center's Swap Shed said they could host it! Even better, they had a new indoor location with a bunch of space.\n\nI actually already knew a guy who worked there so I talked with him and he showed me the big janitor's cart he'd completely filled with chargers as people dropped off computers, so we definitely had a good supply to offer up. They just had to be sorted and wrapped up neatly.\n\nSo I wrote up a little proposal for the idea - we planned around using a used IKEA Kallax as the dimensions fit the space we'd been allotted and the removable drawers were a good size and convenient for taking out and searching. I asked if anyone has one on Everything is Free (partly because my earlier post had been popular) and someone did! They said it was in kinda rough shape but they'd love for it to get a third life at the swap shed.\n\nThe recycling center needed it to be on castors so I checked my supply of lumber and built a cart. Pretty much all my lumber comes from trash day finds, taking stuff apart, or cleanouts on Everything is Free, but someone from the group contributed a 2x4 for this project. Everything else was scraps I had, including a shelf salvaged from an IKEA expidit a friend got rid of, which happened to be the perfect size.\n\nThe castors I think are from an office chair or similar (a couple have locks). They're basically just a swiveling wheel attached to a metal shaft. I drilled holes into the 2-bys, fit each castor with a washer so it would stay at the correct height and JB-welded them in place. \n\nI had some mostly dried-up black acrylic paint I wanted to try reviving. I mixed it with water and it sort of worked, I got a very thin black stain that took several coats. I applied it with old napkins to the outer edges of the cart to make it a little subtler.\n\nI fastened the cart to the shelving unit with wood screws along the edges where the kallax is made of particleboard rather than cardboard. I predrilled the holes and poured wood glue in first to help the screws hold.\n\nThe next step was making it look good. It was actually in much better shape than I'd expected and everything already matched which was a nice surprise. But I wanted the labels to look nicer than just handwriting on tape.\n\nSo we picked the four big brands we had a ton of and cut some stencils of their logos (I used to do them by hand but this time we used a laser cutter I had access to). Then I spraypainted them on. I only had light gray paint but that kind of worked out - painting on the satin-ey fabric was tricky and gray underspray was easier to hide with a sharpie. (Hitting it with some black paint first and letting that dry in the fabric helped harden it up so it took less paint for the light-gray coats to show. Fewer coats means fewer opportunities for leaks or underspray.) I then went over each one with a brush and white acrylic paint. \n\nThe last step was signage - my wife's work has a vinyl cutter and she's great at applying it, so we put together a label and applied it to the side which faces visitors as they enter the swap shed. If we hadn't had access to that I'd have stenciled it on with more spray paint.\n\nOverall I'm quite pleased with how it turned out and with the reception it's had with the community so far! So far we've given away at least 12 chargers (one lady showed me the Amazon listing she had been planning to buy while I helped her find one that matched, and it was $65!) And we've started in on a similar system for various cables!\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxt0tx", "created_utc": 1744496549.0, "score": 1205, "author": "ProtectYourPlant", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1jxt0tx/i_put_together_a_station_where_my_recycling/", "html_title": ""}

La Roche Posay Lipikar Daily Repair Moisturizing Body Lotion Unscented ($1.48/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: very similar to the CeraVe lotion, just slightly thicker such that it appears white while CeraVe\u2019s is slightly transparent (when initially pumped out, both are clear when applied)\n\nScent \u2013 immediately off-putting, enough that I knew I would not be using this on my face long term. I gave it around a week to see if I adjusted to the smell, but no go.\n\nIrritation \u2013 none\n\nOther - I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately the smell was not something I was willing to deal with. Short term, this is otherwise not discernable from CeraVe\u2019s. Long term it may be different as unlike the CeraVe Daily Lotion it contains niacinamide. This is one of the actives that I\u2019m particularly interested in because it 1) has some of the better scientific support for its use 2) the evidence shows impact on a broad range of things (hydration, redness reduction, oil regulation, etc.), and 3) it is reported as less irritating that many other actives. Still, not worth it for that smell in my opinion.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion \u2013 For Normal to Dry Skin ($0.91/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: Initially it appeared similar to La Roche Posay\u2019s lotion in consistency and it glides on easily, however it doesn\u2019t actually \u2018dry\u2019 or soak into the skin. It feels like Vaseline on my face even when using the smallest amount, and my hair kept sticking to my face\n\nScent \u2013 minimal scent, less even than CeraVe\u2019s, and the only descriptor I have for it is \u2018lotion\u2019\n\nIrritation \u2013 slightly irritating to my face (slight stinging that persists long after application and led to a bit more acne than usual). This did not happen when using it on the rest of my body\n\nOther \u2013 I had hopes for this one as my other niacinamide-containing moisturizer after the LRP lotion. This one never actually suggests you use it on your face, so I can\u2019t be mad at them for the face irritation I experienced.\n\n\u00a0\n\n4. Aveeno Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion ($0.63/fluid ounce)\n\nThis one is not an actual contender. I was originally planning to try this one because it is supposed to be lighter weight and thus likely better for the face relative to the normal Aveeno lotion (the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion, listed below). However, I had learned my lesson with LRP and smelled this one in the store before purchasing. I disliked the smell enough that I instead decided to try the regular Aveeno Daily lotion (below). I don\u2019t think the scent was as bad as the LRP\u2019s lotion, but it\u2019s hard to compare the scent to the other since I did not actually bring it home with me.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion For Dry Skin ($0.64/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: This one had a much denser texture \u2013 it stands upright in a little sphere before you spread it out. I found this to be detrimental as it took more effort to spread a small amount across my face. This was only a problem because the slightly higher pressure was irritating to the acne on my face. I also seemed to need less of it than previous lotions, though it\u2019s hard to compare volume used when the consistency is different. Despite the thicker consistency, it does appear matte a few minutes after applying, even when using a decent amount.\n\nScent - It has a slightly stronger scent than CeraVe\u2019s, but not enough that I automatically disqualified it.\u00a0\n\nIrritation \u2013 This maybe caused a slightest amount of irritation. It may have just been due to the harder rubbing that was required to smooth it across my face.\n\nOther \u2013 If I hadn\u2019t happened to have a slightly irritated face from acne, I would have considered this one more. It\u2019s nice to be able to apply a larger amount without the feel or look of it tending towards Vaseline, but I\u2019d rather have something I can quickly slap on without having to smooth it out a lot (which is something all the other options provided).\n\n\u00a0\n\n6. Eucerin Daily Hydration Unscented Body Lotion for Sensitive Dry Skin ($0.70/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: Lightweight with smooth application, but again it\u2019s shiny, though not as bad as Cetaphil\u2019s. If I apply the absolute minimum, it\u2019s not noticeably shiny. However, when my skin was feeling just a bit dry from a cold front, I applied a more normal amount of lotion and it left my face shiny.\n\nScent - The best smelling of the bunch. It\u2019s again a very light smell, but this is the only one where the \u2018neutral\u2019 smell tends towards a nice scent as opposed to an off-putting scent.\n\nIrritation \u2013 No irritation\n\nOther - None\n\n\u00a0\n\nI wish now that I had also kept a list of the lotions I considered and then decided not to try. This mostly happened for lotions with fragrance or whose reviews mentioned they were thick & heavy (not what I wanted for daily use). These are also limited to what was pretty easy to access for me - i.e., available in the US at Target, Walgreens, or CVS.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019ve found a multipurpose lotion that works for your face and body \u2013 let me know! Conversely, if you have one to add to the \u2018not recommended for the face\u2019, please also share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1jrtes1/for_those_who_want_to_have_1_moisturizer_for_face/", "created_utc": 1743820543.0, "score": 47, "author": "Far-Flower-3161", "num_comments": 46, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1jrtes1/for_those_who_want_to_have_1_moisturizer_for_face/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This month I just didn't really run out of things or have a need to make a lot of swaps. I do have a few updates on some topics from previous months though.\n\nSwapped this month:\n\n* I swapped to a different plastic-free deodorant brand called Dessert Essence. (I got Vico back in January, but ran through it fairly quick since I'd have to re-apply.) I haven't seen anything about it online, but they just happen to carry it at a local eco store, so I gave it a try. I like it better, but Vico is probably also fine for many people. Deodorant is so individual.\n* I'm including this one again this month in this section because I actually got a chance to try them: Cloth menstrual pads. Honestly, I don't think I could ever go back to the disposable ones. It's just such an insane difference in dryness and comfort. And this may be TMI, so I'll block it, but >!they just smell so much better. And I'm sure anyone who's worn pads will understand.!< I believe I will prefer them to period underwear because I have quite a heavy flow, and I think it's easier for me to just change a pad than a my whole underwear. I couldn't recommend this switch strongly enough. The sustainable alternative isn't just better for the environment, but WORKS so much better.\n\nFailed this month:\n\n* To keep it transparent, I backslid a lot this month when it comes to food. I got very busy and ate a lot of fast food, and bought several bagged salad mixes. I will try to be better next month. I would love some suggestions on what y'all eat when things are crazy and you're trying to be as zero waste as possible on very little time.\n\nSwaps I plan to make next:\n\n* All same as last month. Haven't run out of laundry detergent or toilet paper yet.\n* Mascara, after the complete fail with the Lush ones. I tried using it in my eyebrows, but even that's difficult because it runs down my face by mid-day. Any ideas what I can do with the pigments?\n\nSo yeah, sorry this month's update is a little slim!

As a culture, we have forgotten so many easy ways to live more sustainably in just one or two generations. \n\nA good example is ironing clothes. I recently saw a meme about ironing clothes and how it is silly and a waste of time. I agree, that washing clothes and ironing them after washing is a waste of time. \n\nPeople have completely forgotten what a clothing iron was invented to do, and how it was supposed to save time, money, energy, and waste. It's no one's fault individually. As a culture, we failed to preserve this knowledge.\n\nPeople in the past used the iron to refresh clothes that were too delicate to be washed. Clothes had embroidery, were hand stitched and made of materials that could not be washed in hot water with harsh soap (silk, linen, wool) without losing their shape. \n\nHow do you clean clothes you cannot wash? First, to get rid of the smell, clothes would be aired. Then, any stains would be treated locally. To remove any lingering smells and germs and to freshen up the look, the clothes would be misted lightly with water and ironed. Giving a dress a quick ironing saved time and it saved waste. Clothes that were ironed, instead of washed every time they had been worn could last years and still look decent.\n\nPeople ironed clothes INSTEAD of washing them. It's silly to do both. \n\nIf you have clothes made of natural fibres, consider giving them a quick ironing instead of a wash every second or third time you wear them. A clothing iron is hotter than the water you would use to wash your clothes and the heat kills germs and smells more effectively. Save water, laundry time, soap, and clothes.

{"title": "My Zero Waste life (sort-of) as a mexican (guide)", "selftext": "Hello!! I'm a 21yo from Mexico, and I began my zero waste journey around 2018-2019. I know most people here, as in this subreddit, are from our neighboring country, the united states. So I see a lot of posts about products that originate from there. And they look so pretty! But being young and living in a third world country means that most of the time, I can't afford those overseas fancy products. \n\nThis is not a critique whatsoever to this subreddit or any of those products, I just want to share my journey as a young person who doesn't have a lot of money and hear what other people who share our ecological philosophy have to say about these things I do, because of lack of money, time, or availability of these products, so here are some alternatives I use everyday for miscelaneous things that are available in my country.\n\nproduct names will be in **bold.**\n\n**BATHROOM**\n\nThere are many things in the bathroom of which I have an alternative to, but some of them still haven't found a solution to, so I stopped buying them altogether or are just waiting for them to be empty before I look for a replacement elsewhere. I don't really use perfume, and when I do, It's usually a hand me down. I don't use makeup, or paint my nails or dye my hair, and i don't use cotton swabs for my ears either.\n\n* bar soap: any kind\n* shampoo bar: for this I use three different kinds, a brand that onlyu sells in a shop around the corner of my house, [ko essential](https://www.koessential.com/) and [arbol verde](https://arbolverde.com.mx/#https://arbolverde.com.mx/#!/tienda) shampoo bars.\n* toothbrushes: [bamboo toothbrushes](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/cepillo-dental-equate-de-bamboo-cerdas-suaves/00750649500263) from said shop or from soriana (when I can go)\n* luffa: sold on another pop shop near my house or in [Soriana](https://www.soriana.com/3m-nexcare-esponja-de-bano-fibras-naturales-1-pieza/2027366.html)/Aurrer\u00e1. You can also crochet your own with some ixtle threads using granny squares\n* toothpaste: currently using up my toothpaste for sensitive teeth in order to buy a [new one](https://muyme.mx/) in a market near my college. It's more expensive, but I think it's worth it. \n* [menstrual cup](http://www.angelcup.mx): sold everywhere now. I'm planning on geting a new one once mine stops working\n* bidet: Bought a hose from aliexpress and Installed it myself on my bathroom, best buy ever. Although, had I known it was just a hose, i'd have gotten it from my local hardware store\n* reusable toilet cloths: bought a 50 pack from amazon (not very ecofriendly) but I couldn't find anything of the sort anywhere else. haven't used toilet paper since. \n* razors: don't use it often, but I have a stainless steel razor, and every once in a while i'll buy my 100pack blades from aliexpress because those aren't sold here and split it with a friend, I also have an electric razor.\n* deodorant: currently using an alum stone with peta approved vegan paraben free [dove deodorant](https://www.dove.com/us/en/p/vitamin-care-lavender-chamomile.html/00079400509093), but planning on buying one with no packaging when it runs out.\n* cream: I don't really use cream so I don't know why i have it, it comes in plastic but it's sort of like a jar.\n\n>wishlisted items: wall mounted solid soap grater/dispenser, and some silicone holders for my things. I don't know if there is a bar moisturizer but i'd want some, and those toothbrush tablets. bamboo floss maybe? but I don't really floss ( I should)\n\n**KITCHEN**\n\nThe kitchen situation is strange because, i have some things i buy in bulk but others have to get from the grocery store which usually come in plastic. I also have some alternatives to certain utensils and things I have to avoid plastic. so I'll be dividing it into categories. Most of the shops I talk about are in the street next to my house, or near me, since I don't own any vehicles.\n\n**Food**\n\n* chicken: I don't usually buy meat, but when I do, I try to get chicken from **BACHOCO** (usually chicken) and just boil it down, I save the bones when buying any type of chicken and store them in the freezer for when I want to make bone broth. I have cats so it's good for them and I take care of street wildlife so they don't puncture their throats with said bones. \n* eggs: I have a designated [basket](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/canasta-para-huevo-top-choice-forma-de-gallina/00489185685339?from=/search) for eggs, totally unnecessary buy but I bring it with me every time I go out for eggs, which I get in **BACHOCO** at 2USD the kg (13-15 large eggs) so they don't come in carboard or plastic!\n* fruits and vegetables: I like getting them from my local verduler\u00eda, but they're more expensive and only accept cash. I take a bag with me to get them.\n* spices and bulk items: local bulk shop things like parmesan are cheaper than even costco, and all spices cost like, cents. \n* meat aternatives: I like to buy chata soy chorizo and textured soy chorizo and prepare (the last one) with some knorr suiza. that's powdered chicken broth (or so it says)\n* powdered milk mixed with water and normal milk: It lasts and tastes good (i only drink with Ice and coffe or chocolate, so the cold is not an issue) can be any brand. except aurrer\u00e1 milk, it's awful.\n* popcorn: I make myself, a dollar half a kg in my local bulk store, and powdered flavor packets from **Willys**\n\n**Utensils**\n\nMost of the utensils I use are either metal or wood, but I still use some plastic\n\n* tuppers: I don't own many, I use [cream or yogurt packaging](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/crema-acida-lala-entera-426-ml/00750102056190?from=/search), because It's lightweight, the same brand owns everything (lala or alpura) so they all fit together two sizes, and reuse jars for things like homemade pesto.\n* metal mixing bowls: I just use them as regular bowls\n* metal/wood utensils. bought probably in **aurrer\u00e1**\n* stainless steel pan: it's so pretty\n* cotton towels: bought in **aurrer\u00e1** or [parisina](https://www.laparisina.mx/default/toalla-facial-bali-hueso/)\n* water jugs: are made of plastic but can be refilled\n* metal drying rack\n\n>wishlisted Items: some metal trays for baking, maybe? and those magnetic spice jars, or magnetic anything, i love magnets for space usageee, I'm also planning on learning how to sew and wax clothes for making food wraps and cloth bags for bulk shopping. a metal mesuring cup and metal cups! I LOVE METAL\n\n**Cleaning**\n\n* sponges: submerge in vinegar and they smell like new! They're still plastic, but I buy ones more [resistant to wear](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/esponja-3m-scotch-brite-superficies-delicadas/00750102312859?from=/search) and they have lasted me a year or so, and use regular cleaning sponges (haven't used my entire pack yet) for drying after cleaning.\n* [curb detergent containers](https://listado.mercadolibre.com.mx/suavitel-10-litros): I don't really buy detergent or softener, so sometimes I see these jugs on the street and pick them up, I currently have two, with vinegar and jabon zote mix respectively.\n* [jabon zote](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/jabon-zote-en-barra-blanco-400-g/00750102600537?from=/search): this thing is a life changer. Its a regular soap, only has three ingredients, cow lard, lye and this flower that smells citrusy. Its a giant block of soap I use for washing the dishes by rubbing it directly on the sponge, and for washing clothes, I'll grate it and boil it with a lot of water and some sodium bicarbonate, and pout into a container. I don't do this often\n* vinegar: use it for mold, as softener, and for rinsing sponges.\n* diatomaceous earth: good against bugs and isn't harmful or has any synthetic chemicals.\n* sodium bicarbonate: mix with lemon and remove any oil stains.\n* rags: they're always useful. \n\nfor laundry, I take a small jar with my handmade detergent and go to a laundry shop, and air dry in my yard. \n\n>wishlist: natural sponges or brush for dishes, more containers so I can pile them up, and store more things inside, ethylic alcohol, and oxigenated water for sanitizing and bleaching (in a less harsh way).\n\n**Reducing/Reusing/Recycling/:** \n\nfor this section I don't have many products but rather a detailed guide based on the place I live. For trash, I usually separate it into 4 categories, or 5. \n\n* edible food scraps: things like food about to be bad, I freeze, and use it for later.\n* compost: anything organic or that can decompose, This includes leaves and all food scraps., i put them in the compost bin and then dump them in my backyard.\n* recyclables: My city accepts the following. I made this little infography to put in my fridge. As you can see, it's a lot, I think they sell it. But there's people that come pick it up at your house and sell it themselves. They also pick pizza boxes. I don't usually separate the plastic bags because I don't kknow the difference and I don't want to cause problems by wishcycling on accident, so it put them in the next category. they have many specific instructions for these, so usually I wash what needs to be washed, let it dry and crush it. And have it in a box somewhere until someone comes pick it up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs96nmf2skre1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b1a919762e41fc70bd3b2602c4717b5e28b842f\n\n* clean non-recyclables: pieces of tooth floss, tape, some packaging, you name it and place them inside of the largets pet container i can find. plastic bags (the ones that food come in, I reuse for cat litter disposal, and grocery bags (when my roomies get them), i use to make plarn and knit useful things with.\n* dirty non-recyclables. in the trash. I have three roommates and we get out like a bag of trash every week or every other week. \n\n>wishlist: proper recycling bins\n\n**transport + some abilities:**\n\nI usually use public transport or carpool, it's cheaper and great way to make friends. I take with me my metal water cup and some utensils, just in case, and an umbrella for not getting sunburnt. most of the time I walk though.\n\n  \nIf you want to be better at repurposing things or being crafty/using the most of what you own, you can learn how to sew, for any pieces of cloth you have, or knit/crochet, you can use [anything](https://youtu.be/ZQMQH7PoHqU) as yarn. If you buy certain products often, like maruchan, dog food or cat litter, you can use the packaging to [make baskets](https://ruutupunontaa.fi/en/) for organizing your home or selling made of those upcycled materials.

Lucked out on this one as the old machine kicked the bucket anyway.\n- Not disabled-dog specific, but I try to buy food and treats locally and in bulk, using reusable containers and bags. \n\n\nIssues to solve:\n\n- We still use a swiffer to quickly clean up a mess before it dries into the floor. I\u2019ve had washable sponges for mops but you can only salvage them for so long. And the constant refilling of a mop bucket throughout the day became impractical. \n- We go through a ton of paper towels. They\u2019re good for poop pickup and absorbing urine puddles. I need to just get in the habit of grabbing a rag or towel for urine. But poop pickup is easier with paper towels. \n- All of the cleaning products we use come in plastic bottles (Nature\u2019s miracle). Even the refill containers. I haven\u2019t come up with a DIY mixture I like. We have tile and wood flooring. \n\nI know folks have strong feelings about the ecological impact of companion animals.

{"title": "Update on New Year\u2019s Resolution - Two Months Progress", "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nI'm back again with my second month of progress towards my New Year's Resolution of swapping all of my cosmetic and hygiene products to plastic free and zero waste alternatives. I have expanded to household cleaning products, dried pantry staples, and produce as well.\n\nHere's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1in9a97/update_on_new_years_resolution_one_month_progress/) to last month's post. In summary, I swapped to:\n\n* Kitsch shampoo and conditioner bars\n* Bar soap\n* Vico deodorant\n* Compostable q tips\n* Dropped make-up remover wipes\n\nSwapped this month:\n\n* Powder dishwasher detergent. Works fine. I forget the name. I just got the only one they had at Target.\n* Pantry staples from bulk bins. I was so excited to learn about the refill store near me!! They only have dried foods, no cleaning supplies, but it's certainly a step in the right direction! Rice, beans, nuts, etc covered from here on.\n* Lush plastic-free mascara. Honestly would not recommend. Maybe it's useful for people with blond eyelashes? They really only change the color. Absolutely zero lengthening/thickening involved. The good news is it washes off with plain water. Bad news is it runs down my face while I'm wearing it.\n* Cloth menstrual pads. I bought two from the local eco-friendly store to try out before making my own and test their absorbancy/pattern to know what to expect. They only carried GladRags, so I got one day pad and one night pad. I haven't gotten to try them just yet.\n* Cloth cleaning rags. I was basically already doing this, but there were many instances I was reaching for the paper towels when I should have reached for the rags. My roommates use paper towels, so they're right there on the counter. Just focusing on not giving in to convenience and using them.\n* Cloth napkins. Just using kitchen towels for this atm. Might snag some actual cloth napkins if I find some at the thrift store.\n\nDropped this month:\n\n* Plastic-packaged produce. Ex) plastic bag of potatoes, plastic bag of greens, etc. Only buying \"naked\" produce now. This seems obvious, I know, and I was already sort of doing this before, but I'm just really committing from now on. The hardest thing to drop was bagged salad mixes. Also my grocery store doesn't carry some things plastic free, like leafy greens, celery, grapes, etc. So I've had to adjust my diet a bit.\n\nFailed swap:\n\n* Lush plastic-free mascara. Will absolutely not repurchase. I'm dreading how long what I have will last.\n\nSwaps I plan to make next:\n\n* Powder detergent in cardboard for washing machine. Will probably be at least a couple months before I run out of the bulk liquid I have.\n* Bidet. I had one in a place I used to live, but it was cold water which was...not pleasant lol. I'd love to get a nice heated one soon. If you have a recommended brand, I'd love to hear it.\n* Eco-friendly toilet paper. I found this useful tool for toilet paper brands https://www.nrdc.org/stories/best-worst-tissue-brands. Trader Joe's tissue itself has a great score, but the packaging is plastic. Considering Aria, but I don't have a local vendor so I'd have to ship from Amazon. Much to consider.\n\nMiscellaneous other progress:\n\n* I realized that coffee grounds/filter are compostable, I realize this is dumb, but it just went right over my head before.

{"title": "Can reusing glass packaging not solve a significant amount of waste issue?", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI live in the UK, and there is a massive problem with recycling here which I have been thinking about. \n\nBasically majority of the recycling waste isn\u2019t actually worth recycling, they either go to incinerator or landfill, here or in another country. It\u2019s simply not working. \n\nMost of the recycling waste in our house comes from food packaging and bottles. So I have this dream, where a government makes it mandatory to have the same size/shape glass containers for certain food products and instead of recycling, these containers get cleaned and reused. \n\nFor example, instead of 330ml cans, all drink companies must get their head together, decide on a certain type of 330ml glass bottle and only use that for that amount of their product. They can differ their products with low-environmental impact stickers that comes off easily, and the lid but the main part stays the same. These then get collected and washed and reused. Same for other size bottles, alcoholic drinks etc. They all have to go into the same bottle. \n\nAnd, all ready meal companies must pick the same square container of certain size for their product. All jars, fruits, cheese, butter, milk\u2026 everything that comes in plastic, can also go in a glass container to be then cleaned and reused. \n\nThis can be extended to cleaning products, chemicals, soap/shampoo bottles\u2026 you get the picture. \n\nInstead of burning or burying all the plastic, and smashing the glass to melt and reshape, it would be just cleaning. \n\nChanges would need to be made to collect these without damaging them much. Obviously it would be expensive and difficult in the beginning, but overtime once the infrastructure is there, a significant amount of plastic waste would be replaced by glass, and cleaned and resold to manufacturers who then just need to put their label on the lid.\n\nWhy is this not a part of the solution?

Lush gives you a discount for returning empty packaging too.\n\n**Surcharges:** Some places charge extra if you use disposable packaging, the uni cafe now charges 30p if you want to use a single-use cup which is around the same as some of the big chains. \n\n**Deposits:** I haven\u2019t come across any in Sheffield yet, but I\u2019ve heard of reuse systems at festivals, where you pay a bit extra for a reusable cup and get your money back when you return it. I think some takeaway food places are trying similar schemes too.\n\nWould love to know if other places in the UK and around the world are doing this - especially any cool or unexpected examples! \n\nAlso, what\u2019s the biggest discount, surcharge, or deposit you\u2019ve come across?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1iugy8r/how_common_are_incentives_for_reuse/", "created_utc": 1740107279.0, "score": 5, "author": "sophieLpott", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1iugy8r/how_common_are_incentives_for_reuse/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Update on New Year\u2019s Resolution - One Month Progress", "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nI thought it might be fun to go over the progress I've made towards my New Year's Resolution of swapping all of my cosmetic and hygiene products to plastic free and zero waste alternatives by the end of the year.\n\nOf course, I am using up all of the things I already have first, so it may be some time before I get around to each swap. Especially since some things were bought in bulk.\n\nSwaps I have already made:\n\n* Kitsch shampoo and conditioner bars. Not entirely zero waste as they do have paperboard packaging, but certainly better than plastic bottles. And truly, my hair has never looked or felt better! I have fine, wavy hair and I've been using the rice protein one.\n* (Vico) bar soap. I wasn't entirely out of body wash when I purchased this, but I went ahead and got it to get free shipping on the deodorant. I've relegated the rest of my body wash to my gym bag. (I shower at the gym twice a week, so it will get used.) It's good. It's soap. Came with no wrapper packaging, which is good, but I had to get it shipped to me, so it had a box. I wouldn't bother purchasing it again. I will instead just get soap from a local seller at the farmer's market.\n* Vico deodorant. This is part of an ongoing saga of finding a deodorant that doesn't make me smell like a barn animal. Twice now I've found one that worked only for it to undergo a formula change or be discontinued. This one works pretty good, but I have to reapply throughout the day. I've also tried Native plastic free deodorant, which made me smell exponentially worse than wearing nothing at all. Fortunately it worked great for my partner. After I finish, I plan to try Ethique. Hopefully it has better lasting power. Sadly I can't use aluminum deodorant due to prolonged exposure contact dermatitis (dermatologist confirmed). \n* \\*Bamboo q tips. I know I know I know. You're \"not supposed to use q tips\". But I TRIED cutting them out for the last two months and actually for the first time in my life had to go to the doctor for an earwax extraction because my right ear was fully blocked. So I switched to fully compost-able bamboo/cotton q tips in compost-able packaging and will endeavor to use them less frequently.\n\nStopped using and did not replace:\n\n* Make-up remover wipes. Honestly, I miss these a lot. Often after washing off my make-up, I'm still left with racoon eyes (even after using an oil cleanser). The easiest fix for this was a tearing off a little strip of a make-up remover wipe. I am hoping someone may have a suggestion for maybe some sort of make-up remover/micellar water tablets that can be dissolved in water that I can use with a cloth, or whatever other solution people use.\n\nFailed swap:\n\n* I bought an off brand water pic. It literally does nothing and now I'm suck with this useless device that I have no idea what to do with and I still have to use dental floss. Looking for more eco-friendly floss suggestions.\n\nSwaps I plan to make next:\n\n* Lush mascara. I'm hoping it works. I'm a bit worried about shipping because they warn against temperature damage in transport, but the closest Lush to me if 4 hours away. If anyone has a recommendation for another company, I'd be interested! \n* Cloth menstrual pads. I'm planning to make these myself from some old clothes that don't fit anymore using a pattern I found free online. I bought a menstrual cup, but it caused me so much pain and leaked so badly, I'm scared to try it again.\n\nSo yeah, that's my long-winded summary of my progress so far this year.

{"title": "Bar Shampoo", "selftext": "So I was looking for advice from people and this seems to be the main reddit that has talk of shampoo bars so I will post this here. So I have been using bar shampoo for... maybe 3 years now. I always get it from a local soap maker.

I currently have long hair again and most of the time I find my bar shampoo is fine, though I do keep a bottle of clarifying shampoo for if I let my hair go for to long without a wash. So that's a bit of the back story now onto why I have went looking for advice. So this past month I have been depressed and let my hair washing go longer then usual. I usually was it every 2 weeks but I let it go a month.... part of it was lack of energy the other was the weather has been so cold and dry, I use a boar bristle brush to distribute sebum and my ends needed it, they keep freezing at work from condensation of my breath. I then put coconut oil on my ends before I washed my hair for a few hours. It is the first time using oil on my hair then removing it with a bar shampoo. My nephew had used all my clarifying shampoo and I haven't replaced it. I figured I would need to work a bit harder to get it out but was up to the task. I went through 3 washes and when I was rinsing out my conditioner I could tell my hair was still greasy.\n\nSo the question is am I asking to much from my bar shampoo or do I need a better one? I don't know anyone else that uses it so I only have my experience with this one bar I have been getting for years. In the past I have wanted a bit more from it but also partially figured it might be the fact it's just a bar shampoo. If you have one that is potentially a better option I would love to know what people use and their opinions on it. \n\nSorry I know this is a lot of hair talk for a subreddit thats not necessarily hair but also it's about my hair and a product that likely more people on a zero waste subreddit would know about.

{"title": "Guilt with decluttering", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI'm not 100% zero waste, however I consider myself a pretty sustainable person. I don't buy things I don't need (most of the time), I repair clothes with holes and I always use up what I have in my house even if it isn't to my liking (like bulk toothpaste my husband bought from Costco).\n\nHowever, I recently moved into a home and for the past year a lot of my stuff was in storage. As I've been unpacking, I found a lot of things from my college/high school days that I purchased but don't have use for. Or, things like yearbooks and such I just don't really want to keep.\n\nSome things I can gift/donate/sell, but some things just need to be thrown away, such as a crappy McDonald's play toy from middle school or a broken glasses case.\n\nI find myself feeling guilty when I throw things away, knowing it is a permanent item that will live in the world for a long long time. However, the stress of having so much stuff in my home negatively impacts my mental health. \n\nSo I ask for advice. How do you stop feeling guilty about decluttering? For the past several years I have been very mindful about items I bring into my home but college and high school me didn't think that way. So here I am with piles of stuff I simply don't want anymore. I do recycle everything I can but some stuff is not able to be recycled either.\n\nThanks for any advice you all can give me. I would really like to make my space intentional without the weight of my stuff on my shoulders.\n\nUpdate: I really appreciate everyone's contribution to this post. I feel a lot better with the decisions I'm having to make for some of these things. I also have ADHD which makes having an organized space even more important. \n\nI'm glad I am much better at mindfulness now and I know moving forward I can help avoid the massive clutter by not buying things I don't need.

{"title": "Advice for Mouth Guards", "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying: I know that when it comes to medical issues that we can't (and shouldn't) compromise. That said, there are some alternatives out there and I want to know y'all's experience with them, to determine the best path forward.\n\nI recently had a sleep study done and discovered that I grind my teeth in my sleep. The solution for grinding is mouth guards, which are predominantly plastic. Aside from the environmental issues with plastic, I'm not in love with the idea of grinding plastic down with my teeth every night and swallowing the subsequent microscopic particles. (Guess this depends on whether or not mouth guards completely stop teeth grinding or just protect your teeth from the grinding, probably depends on the exact guard.)\n\nThere are EVA plastic mouthguards, which don't have BPA, BPS, and phthalates in them, so those would be my choice if I end up deciding that plastic is the best option. \n\nI've found woven hemp mouth guards, which you boil in the morning to disinfect, but I'm unsure about their design and am wondering if anyone has had experience with them. Here's the link to the ones I found: https://answersbynature.com/products/original-mouthguard \n\nI found one that is made of 100% medical grade silicon, but it's more for sports. That said, I've seen some reviews that say it works well for bruxism (teeth grinding) as well. Here's the link for the one I'm looking at: https://www.shockdoctor.com/products/braces-mouthguard?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&variant=14354235228213&utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Skimlinks&clickId=15736469&cjevent=bc4a9185dd8e11ef81b8ac480a82b824\n\nI also found a a really interesting one, again for sports, that's made of biodegradable plastic. The statement they have about their material and what biodegradable means seems earnest, and even goes as far as to explain the lack of standardization in determining biodegradability. (They are a bit off when they say that fungi will break down the plastic in a landfill, as it's actually microbes that will break down the plastic anaerobically, which causes the release of methane, but they tried.) Here's the link for this brand: https://www.sisuguard.com/\n\nThere are also more standard-looking hemp and natural rubber options from Natural Mouth Guard and Natural Mouth Guards, respectively, but both are in the starting stages so they are not available for immediate purchase. I reached out about purchasing one to the former of the two, so I'm hoping to hear back from them.\n\nWith all of this said, I'm interested to know y'all's experience with any of these products. Additionally, if you've gone the plastic route, I would like to know which ones you found the most long-lasting.\n\nIn a perfect world I would test each of these, starting with the most sustainable one, but unfortunately I really don't have the funds to try more than two.\n\nThanks in advance for y'all's help! \n\nP.S.

I have a problem with companies like Tony's Chocolonely who still choose to buy cacao from West Africa - you cannot make a sustainable product out of such a complex system, where millions of families are employed and deforestation in a bigger issue. plus, in order to support the farmers, you have to pay a premium price for your chocolate bar (Tony's is actually very cheap, considering it comes is 180 gr. bars). a striking move would be to break away from the West Africa supplies, making smaller batches and sourcing from different countries.\n\n  \ncraft chocolate makers directly buy their cacao from estates and cooperatives, providing you with precise data about it on the wrappers (most of the times). you'll find pieces of information on the number of farmers involved, the cooperative's/estate's name and location, the cacao variety, the altitude... all of this by paying a big premium price for the beans, that come in small or micro batches. makers often travel to the places where the source cacao from (if they aren't already locals), investing in a number of initiatives with positive outcomes. \n\n  \nregarding the cacao quality, each batch is different, even within the same region. farmers all over the world harvest cacao from finer genetics that naturally posess bright and strong tasting notes (it's up to the makers to choose what to enhance and how). the dark chocolate you find in stores has been roasted to the point it tastes burnt: this is why most people get the idea that dark chocolate is bitter. truth is chocolate can have very different and peculiar tasting notes: it can be very fruity, creamy and dairy-like, herbal and robust, spicy... without any added flavour. I've had 100% with very low bitterness!\n\n  \nthe depth of the flavour profile also allow consumers to eat less chocolate in order to feel satisfied! while bars are smaller (they usually come in 50 gr. bars, maybe 70 gr. at times), you only need to take a little piece and let it melt on your tongue to perceive a stronge taste (+ quality chocolate should have a persistent aftertaste), you probably wouldn't indulge this way. packaging are always made out of paper and most makers are turning to biodegradable and compostable plastic/paper wrappings.\n\n  \nhere you see some bars that confirm everything I've said. the brands are Luisa Abram, Mesti\u00e7o, Krak, Feitoria do Cacao and Original Beans :) let's eat less, buy better and change the chocolate market!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1i84js0/bean_to_bar_chocolate_sustainable_and_impactful/", "created_utc": 1737642449.0, "score": 162, "author": "prugnecotte", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1i84js0/bean_to_bar_chocolate_sustainable_and_impactful/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Ideas for Encouraging Students to Be Sustainable at School", "selftext": "\nI've come up with three ideas to encourage students to reduce, reuse, and recycle, in that order.\n\nReduce: Give a student a reward if they manage to finish all or most of their lunch instead of wasting it. A sticker board will be put up in the cafeteria with the names of each student. Every day, every student who finished all or most of their lunch will be given a sticker. A teacher or lunch monitor will be in charge of keeping track. The rewards can be anything the school sees fit like extra recess time, school-wide recognition, school supplies, or gift cards for higher grades.\n\nReuse: Organize regular art and craft sessions where students can create new items from the collected materials like sculptures, toys, decorations, and functional items like storage containers. Host competitions where students can showcase their creations, with categories like \"Most Creative,\" \"Best Use of Materials,\" and \"Most Functional.\u201d Display the projects in a school exhibition or gallery to celebrate the students' efforts and spread awareness.\n\nRecycle: Each recycling bin is a different color depending on the recycled material. Each time a student finishes their lunch, they take a turn trying to throw their recyclable trash right into the bin. Each successful throw into the correct bin earns one point. You could even add bonus points for students who properly sort multiple items at once. A student volunteer or lunch monitor will keep track of the points. At the end of lunch, the one with the highest score has their name up on the board as the Recycle Master for the rest of the day. Consider offering small eco-friendly prizes, like reusable water bottles or tote bags, for weekly or monthly top scorers.\n\nWhat do you think of these ideas?

However, a dermatologist friend told me odor comes from bacteria, not sweat, and suggested using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution on my underarms before applying my zero-waste deodorant that I claimed doesn\u2019t work. To my surprise, it worked SO well (no stink even after CrossFit)!\n\nNow\u2026 just know that the bottle is plastic BUT recyclable, and The Ordinary claims 85-100% of their packaging is refillable, reusable, recycled, or recoverable.

You can skip to the very end of this post.\n\n# Background (you can skip this)\n\nI try to eat plenty of fruit.  If we **eat healthy** and stay healthy, this can **prevent medical waste** in the future.\n\n*  I sometimes buy **single bananas**.  These are often found off to one side of the banana display in the supermarket.  If nobody buys these, they end up in the store's dumpster.  I put them in regular plastic produce bags brought from home.  My goal is to reuse the bags until they rip.\n*  I sometimes buy **less-attractive oranges**:  e.g. ones which are partly green.  The green bits are just cosmetic damage, and they only affect the peel.  The fruit inside still tastes fine.\n*  Once in a while, I buy a 6-pound bag of Loblaws \"Naturally Imperfect\" apples.  They might be weirdly-shaped, but they still taste good.\n\nI sometimes buy clearance produce, from the supermarket's reduced rack.  I feel better about buying air-freighted fruits such as mangoes if they're already bruised and reduced.\n\nOne bag might contain a few bruised apples and pears.  Or it might hold a couple dozen bruised bananas.  Perhaps there might be a few mangoes on a styrofoam tray, wrapped in [cling film.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_wrap)\n\nMy city says that clean stretchy plastic bags are recyclable here.  I'm not sure whether [MRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_recovery_facility) film plastics tend to get recycled into something useful, or whether they tend to go to landfill.\n\nMy city also says that clean white styrofoam is recyclable here.  The styrofoam recycling rate here might be as high as 31%.

It goes to landfill.  It's safe to assume that the landfill will eventually leak.  The cling film might then generate microplastics which can pollute our waters forever.  Microplastics are probably harmful to human health.\n\n# My question\n\n*  When I buy **non-reduced** fruit, I tend to reuse the same plastic produce bags again and again.\n*  When I buy **reduced** fruit, it's packaged in plastic and/or styrofoam.  I might recycle this, but might never reuse it.

{"title": "What Fussy deodorant do you have?", "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI'm new to this subreddit and the refill/natural deo journey, so here I am searching for advise! A little bit of context:\n\nDue to sensory issues, I'm very picky about deodorants. I can only use deo sticks (preferably not cream, as dry as possible) and I find it hard to find them in stores, even worse to find perfume free ones (Denmark, EU). I've been looking at switching over to a refillable deo stick for a long time now due to these two points + the wish for a more sustainable choice. I don't wear deo often but wants to be better at using it (i don't sweat or smell a lot, but new job makes me sweat more). My current deo, the only one I've tolerated and loved, is starting to smell weird and I can't get it anywhere anymore. So it's time to take the leap for a more sustainable choice that hopefully ticks my boxes.\n\nI used to look at Wild, but read much back and forth with it being good for some, but others hating it or saying it doesn't work. Now that they've been bought by Unilever (and them generally advertising a lot of limited cases all the time, promoting impulsive overconsumption) I've discovered Fussy. Their cases are not as pretty and unique as the Wild cases, but they overall get higher praise with (what appears to be) higher success rate for people. \n\nI have ADHD and I love things that spark joy and look pretty. It helps me remember to use it and enjoy using it. I've tried my best to look up realistic pictures of the different case colors, in real lighting - not overexposed and lightened, but can't find much. \n\nSo to the real question: What case do you have? I would love to see real pictures from you guys, of how they look in bad lighting, sunlight, normal light, any light. I don't know if you can comment photos, so even just a description of how the colors actually look would be nice. I would hate to order a case and not be happy with it, and end up forgetting it exists in my drawer. I've been most drawn to the lilac and mint green, but all photos are welcome! <3 Also if you have any feedback on the fussy, their scents, other brands (shipping within EU) or other tips - please do share! Again, I'm new to this subreddit and the natural deo, so any advice is much appreciated <3 Thank you!\n\n  \nAlso, do you have any experience with their normal deo scents vs sensitive?

I wear these overalls probably longer than I should for uniform-cleanliness standards, but I officially retire them ones I have rips you can see skin through.

I can't wear patched pants at work since my job deems that as being unprofessional. It feels insulting for me to donate them due to the filthy condition of them, though.\n\nI know recently there was a \"crust pants\" trend going around (maybe it still is, idk, maybe it was never trendy and I'm just in punk circles where we were all showing ours off), but there was some criticism around the trend with people buying new pants and intentionally distressing/dirtying them rather than authentically just letting the pants get disgusting and fall apart on their own, which I totally get since that almost feels like some kinda weird \"cultural appropriation\" of poor people (some of those pants were high-end wxpensive pants!) and at bare minimum lacks authenticity - which is what the punk movement is largely about.\n\nBasically, my question is: would it be fucked up for me to patch the holes in my old pants and sell them to people as \"crust pants?\" They're authentically dirty, covered in sealant and whatnot and look very cool in my humble opinion. Plus I'm also broke af and could use the money from selling my pants (at a reasonable price, about half what I bought them for plus a little extra for my labor and materials in patching them), or would it be most ethical to just throw them out and keep the hardware for other projects?

{"title": "I put together a station where my Recycling Center's Swap Shed can give away laptop chargers (pulled from ewaste or donated)", "selftext": "So a few months ago I was digging through a corporate ewaste bin and found laptop chargers. Tons of them (or at least enough to fill around eight shopping bags). All brand new, many still in their packaging.\n\nIt turns out that a company had a supply of \"loaner\" chargers to hand out to people who forgot theirs, but got sick of them taking up space in the office and dumped them.\n\nI hauled them all home and offered them up on my local Everything is Free Page. I was able to give a bunch away but it was pretty inconvenient for everyone involved. (Normally giving working ewaste away is pretty quick and easy here.) I kept thinking if I had the space I could set up a Little Free Library but for laptop chargers. So I asked if anyone on the group knew a way we could do that and someone who volunteers at the Recycling Center's Swap Shed said they could host it! Even better, they had a new indoor location with a bunch of space.\n\nI actually already knew a guy who worked there so I talked with him and he showed me the big janitor's cart he'd completely filled with chargers as people dropped off computers, so we definitely had a good supply to offer up. They just had to be sorted and wrapped up neatly.\n\nSo I wrote up a little proposal for the idea - we planned around using a used IKEA Kallax as the dimensions fit the space we'd been allotted and the removable drawers were a good size and convenient for taking out and searching. I asked if anyone has one on Everything is Free (partly because my earlier post had been popular) and someone did! They said it was in kinda rough shape but they'd love for it to get a third life at the swap shed.\n\nThe recycling center needed it to be on castors so I checked my supply of lumber and built a cart. Pretty much all my lumber comes from trash day finds, taking stuff apart, or cleanouts on Everything is Free, but someone from the group contributed a 2x4 for this project. Everything else was scraps I had, including a shelf salvaged from an IKEA expidit a friend got rid of, which happened to be the perfect size.\n\nThe castors I think are from an office chair or similar (a couple have locks). They're basically just a swiveling wheel attached to a metal shaft. I drilled holes into the 2-bys, fit each castor with a washer so it would stay at the correct height and JB-welded them in place. \n\nI had some mostly dried-up black acrylic paint I wanted to try reviving. I mixed it with water and it sort of worked, I got a very thin black stain that took several coats. I applied it with old napkins to the outer edges of the cart to make it a little subtler.\n\nI fastened the cart to the shelving unit with wood screws along the edges where the kallax is made of particleboard rather than cardboard. I predrilled the holes and poured wood glue in first to help the screws hold.\n\nThe next step was making it look good. It was actually in much better shape than I'd expected and everything already matched which was a nice surprise. But I wanted the labels to look nicer than just handwriting on tape.\n\nSo we picked the four big brands we had a ton of and cut some stencils of their logos (I used to do them by hand but this time we used a laser cutter I had access to). Then I spraypainted them on. I only had light gray paint but that kind of worked out - painting on the satin-ey fabric was tricky and gray underspray was easier to hide with a sharpie. (Hitting it with some black paint first and letting that dry in the fabric helped harden it up so it took less paint for the light-gray coats to show. Fewer coats means fewer opportunities for leaks or underspray.) I then went over each one with a brush and white acrylic paint. \n\nThe last step was signage - my wife's work has a vinyl cutter and she's great at applying it, so we put together a label and applied it to the side which faces visitors as they enter the swap shed. If we hadn't had access to that I'd have stenciled it on with more spray paint.\n\nOverall I'm quite pleased with how it turned out and with the reception it's had with the community so far! So far we've given away at least 12 chargers (one lady showed me the Amazon listing she had been planning to buy while I helped her find one that matched, and it was $65!) And we've started in on a similar system for various cables!\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxt0tx", "created_utc": 1744496549.0, "score": 1198, "author": "ProtectYourPlant", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1jxt0tx/i_put_together_a_station_where_my_recycling/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Here are a few things I've been thinking about:\n\n1. **Reducing single-use plastics**: This includes items like water bottles, straws, and plastic bags. Simple alternatives like reusable bottles, cloth bags, and metal straws can cut down on waste.\n2. **Switching to sustainable packaging**: Companies and individuals should prioritize biodegradable or recyclable packaging. There are a lot of brands now offering products in glass or paper instead of plastic!\n3. **Supporting legislation**: Many countries are banning single-use plastics. It's so important to push for policy changes that reduce plastic production and consumption on a global scale.\n4. **Education and awareness**: By educating ourselves and others about the environmental impacts of plastic and the importance of sustainable practices, we can encourage change within our communities.\n\nWhat are some of the strategies you've been using to reduce your plastic waste?

{"title": "For those who want to have 1 moisturizer for face and body", "selftext": "I was interested in finding a single moisturizer I could use for everything, and ended up trying several. Below are my experiences with them. I chose to post this in ZeroWaste instead of a skincare focused group since my goal was to reducing cost, plastic waste, and the number of products in my bathroom. I selected lotions based on them being relatively inexpensive, marketed to be safe for face, and available in large pump bottles.\n\nYMMV: everyone\u2019s skin is unique and changes over time (due to season, other products being used, age). This describes what these lotions were like when applied to my face: a combination-type face (slightly oily, slightly dry) with mild acne. My favorite ended up being the CeraVe daily lotion, but yours might be different!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Face and Body Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin ($1.02/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel \u2013 fairly thin lotion, spreads easily and dries quickly\n\nScent \u2013 mild (it does not have fragrance but the ingredients themselves do have their own odor), not particularly off-putting\n\nIrritation - none\n\nOther \u2013 This is a very popular body lotion moisturizer that I see get recommended a lot. It was the one I initially bought and will mostly be the point of comparison for the other moisturizers. Active ingredients of note are ceramides and hyaluronic acid, but these don\u2019t have a large impact on my decision making as I am not starting with super dehydrated skin.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. La Roche Posay Lipikar Daily Repair Moisturizing Body Lotion Unscented ($1.48/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: very similar to the CeraVe lotion, just slightly thicker such that it appears white while CeraVe\u2019s is slightly transparent (when initially pumped out, both are clear when applied)\n\nScent \u2013 immediately off-putting, enough that I knew I would not be using this on my face long term. I gave it around a week to see if I adjusted to the smell, but no go.\n\nIrritation \u2013 none\n\nOther - I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately the smell was not something I was willing to deal with. Short term, this is otherwise not discernable from CeraVe\u2019s. Long term it may be different as unlike the CeraVe Daily Lotion it contains niacinamide. This is one of the actives that I\u2019m particularly interested in because it 1) has some of the better scientific support for its use 2) the evidence shows impact on a broad range of things (hydration, redness reduction, oil regulation, etc.), and 3) it is reported as less irritating that many other actives. Still, not worth it for that smell in my opinion.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion \u2013 For Normal to Dry Skin ($0.91/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: Initially it appeared similar to La Roche Posay\u2019s lotion in consistency and it glides on easily, however it doesn\u2019t actually \u2018dry\u2019 or soak into the skin. It feels like Vaseline on my face even when using the smallest amount, and my hair kept sticking to my face\n\nScent \u2013 minimal scent, less even than CeraVe\u2019s, and the only descriptor I have for it is \u2018lotion\u2019\n\nIrritation \u2013 slightly irritating to my face (slight stinging that persists long after application and led to a bit more acne than usual). This did not happen when using it on the rest of my body\n\nOther \u2013 I had hopes for this one as my other niacinamide-containing moisturizer after the LRP lotion. This one never actually suggests you use it on your face, so I can\u2019t be mad at them for the face irritation I experienced.\n\n\u00a0\n\n4. Aveeno Sheer Hydration Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion ($0.63/fluid ounce)\n\nThis one is not an actual contender. I was originally planning to try this one because it is supposed to be lighter weight and thus likely better for the face relative to the normal Aveeno lotion (the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion, listed below). However, I had learned my lesson with LRP and smelled this one in the store before purchasing. I disliked the smell enough that I instead decided to try the regular Aveeno Daily lotion (below). I don\u2019t think the scent was as bad as the LRP\u2019s lotion, but it\u2019s hard to compare the scent to the other since I did not actually bring it home with me.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion For Dry Skin ($0.64/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: This one had a much denser texture \u2013 it stands upright in a little sphere before you spread it out. I found this to be detrimental as it took more effort to spread a small amount across my face. This was only a problem because the slightly higher pressure was irritating to the acne on my face. I also seemed to need less of it than previous lotions, though it\u2019s hard to compare volume used when the consistency is different. Despite the thicker consistency, it does appear matte a few minutes after applying, even when using a decent amount.\n\nScent - It has a slightly stronger scent than CeraVe\u2019s, but not enough that I automatically disqualified it.\u00a0\n\nIrritation \u2013 This maybe caused a slightest amount of irritation. It may have just been due to the harder rubbing that was required to smooth it across my face.\n\nOther \u2013 If I hadn\u2019t happened to have a slightly irritated face from acne, I would have considered this one more. It\u2019s nice to be able to apply a larger amount without the feel or look of it tending towards Vaseline, but I\u2019d rather have something I can quickly slap on without having to smooth it out a lot (which is something all the other options provided).\n\n\u00a0\n\n6. Eucerin Daily Hydration Unscented Body Lotion for Sensitive Dry Skin ($0.70/fluid ounce)\n\nConsistency & feel: Lightweight with smooth application, but again it\u2019s shiny, though not as bad as Cetaphil\u2019s. If I apply the absolute minimum, it\u2019s not noticeably shiny. However, when my skin was feeling just a bit dry from a cold front, I applied a more normal amount of lotion and it left my face shiny.\n\nScent - The best smelling of the bunch. It\u2019s again a very light smell, but this is the only one where the \u2018neutral\u2019 smell tends towards a nice scent as opposed to an off-putting scent.\n\nIrritation \u2013 No irritation\n\nOther - None\n\n\u00a0\n\nI wish now that I had also kept a list of the lotions I considered and then decided not to try. This mostly happened for lotions with fragrance or whose reviews mentioned they were thick & heavy (not what I wanted for daily use). These are also limited to what was pretty easy to access for me - i.e., available in the US at Target, Walgreens, or CVS.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019ve found a multipurpose lotion that works for your face and body \u2013 let me know! Conversely, if you have one to add to the \u2018not recommended for the face\u2019, please also share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1jrtes1/for_those_who_want_to_have_1_moisturizer_for_face/", "created_utc": 1743820543.0, "score": 46, "author": "Far-Flower-3161", "num_comments": 46, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1jrtes1/for_those_who_want_to_have_1_moisturizer_for_face/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Update on New Year\u2019s Resolution - Three Months Progress", "selftext": "Hi y'all,\n\nI'm back with my third month of progress towards my New Year's Resolution of living more Zero Waste.\n\nHere's [January](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1in9a97/update_on_new_years_resolution_one_month_progress/) and [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1j2ryf6/update_on_new_years_resolution_two_months_progress/), which have a lot more interesting stuff. This month I just didn't really run out of things or have a need to make a lot of swaps. I do have a few updates on some topics from previous months though.\n\nSwapped this month:\n\n* I swapped to a different plastic-free deodorant brand called Dessert Essence. (I got Vico back in January, but ran through it fairly quick since I'd have to re-apply.) I haven't seen anything about it online, but they just happen to carry it at a local eco store, so I gave it a try. I like it better, but Vico is probably also fine for many people. Deodorant is so individual.\n* I'm including this one again this month in this section because I actually got a chance to try them: Cloth menstrual pads. Honestly, I don't think I could ever go back to the disposable ones. It's just such an insane difference in dryness and comfort. And this may be TMI, so I'll block it, but >!they just smell so much better. And I'm sure anyone who's worn pads will understand.!< I believe I will prefer them to period underwear because I have quite a heavy flow, and I think it's easier for me to just change a pad than a my whole underwear. I couldn't recommend this switch strongly enough. The sustainable alternative isn't just better for the environment, but WORKS so much better.\n\nFailed this month:\n\n* To keep it transparent, I backslid a lot this month when it comes to food. I got very busy and ate a lot of fast food, and bought several bagged salad mixes. I will try to be better next month. I would love some suggestions on what y'all eat when things are crazy and you're trying to be as zero waste as possible on very little time.\n\nSwaps I plan to make next:\n\n* All same as last month. Haven't run out of laundry detergent or toilet paper yet.\n* Mascara, after the complete fail with the Lush ones. I tried using it in my eyebrows, but even that's difficult because it runs down my face by mid-day. Any ideas what I can do with the pigments?\n\nSo yeah, sorry this month's update is a little slim!

{"title": "Cultural amnesia, household items, and waste", "selftext": "I love this sub because sometimes people post about history, and how people in the past did things in a way that was easier and less wasteful than we do today. As a culture, we have forgotten so many easy ways to live more sustainably in just one or two generations. \n\nA good example is ironing clothes. I recently saw a meme about ironing clothes and how it is silly and a waste of time. I agree, that washing clothes and ironing them after washing is a waste of time. \n\nPeople have completely forgotten what a clothing iron was invented to do, and how it was supposed to save time, money, energy, and waste. It's no one's fault individually. As a culture, we failed to preserve this knowledge.\n\nPeople in the past used the iron to refresh clothes that were too delicate to be washed. Clothes had embroidery, were hand stitched and made of materials that could not be washed in hot water with harsh soap (silk, linen, wool) without losing their shape. \n\nHow do you clean clothes you cannot wash? First, to get rid of the smell, clothes would be aired. Then, any stains would be treated locally. To remove any lingering smells and germs and to freshen up the look, the clothes would be misted lightly with water and ironed. Giving a dress a quick ironing saved time and it saved waste. Clothes that were ironed, instead of washed every time they had been worn could last years and still look decent.\n\nPeople ironed clothes INSTEAD of washing them. It's silly to do both. \n\nIf you have clothes made of natural fibres, consider giving them a quick ironing instead of a wash every second or third time you wear them. A clothing iron is hotter than the water you would use to wash your clothes and the heat kills germs and smells more effectively. Save water, laundry time, soap, and clothes.

Occasionallyz my family or I may strugglto grab jars and such from the top shelf or we may be too tired or sick to grab a jar so we (lackadaisily) attempt to grab it. Sometimes we end up dropping things on accident. Or we're running around the house and we accidentally drop it or bump into it. You'know. After that happened we had to sweep up any glass that was left. The problem was, sometimes little shard would be left over so we would accidentally cut ourselves. We lack tweakers so sometimes we had to pull it out with clean fingers. I hated it. Any glass reminds me of that just waiting to happen. And glass can be thrown if someone is angry enough (throwing dishes, thank God that only happened once in my life and it was years ago when I was a baby). So yes. I know about so many convent containers and replacements and the best part is they do help for when buying in bulk. The thing id need to worry about is where to put all the boxes and stuff and wrappers when I'm done with them (for now I have no choice but to buy boxed things). In place of glass I've decided to use steel but the most convenient containers are plastic. Is there a way I could get away with this?

I'm 23, a lover of lord of the rings, studio ghibi and final fantasy. That may not mean a lot but I grew up with stories about protecting the planet and our ecosystem.\nAs a kid I used to lecture my parents about turning of the lights to save the polar bears. I was 11 at the time haha. \n\nCut to the last 2 years. I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. My whole hospital and recovery experience was littered with single use plastics, silicone gells for healing, latex gloves and disposable sheets when I was radioactive. Disposable knives and forks [I did use wood and paper as soon as I got home].\nEven now my thyroid medication that I will have to be on for the rest of my life is in plastic sheets. \n\nAfter looking up the effects of microplastics and other toxins to the environment I want to do better. It sounds weird but I feel like seeing everything from when I was sick get binned and the amount of trash that formed just by me being sick made me feel guilty. \n\nI've made a few rules for the year to hope to start:\n- no new clothes unless 90+% cotton [mostly for underwear because that can not be second hand sorry- haha.]\n- no new cosmetics unless they run out, only replace with plastic free ingredient alternatives and recyclable packaging programs.\n- no new nail polish. Which is a big one for me admittedly. I love my nail polish, but I want to consume what I have.\n\nNow the big thing that opened my eyes was- holy hell what about the plastic I already own. \nMake up that gets washed down the drain with specs of microglitter made from plastic, same with nail polish and even current nylon clothing that gets washed.\nUsing them feels wrong and yet tossing them in what would end up landfill feels WORSE.\n\nI HAVE ALWAYS taken care of my clothes. I wear things until they practically fall apart [rip to the shirt I have owned since pre school that just got lost and probably disintegrated] \nIf I don't they are gifted or donated. \n\nBut the cosmetics in particular interest me as plastics feel unavoidable.

I don't use makeup, or paint my nails or dye my hair, and i don't use cotton swabs for my ears either.\n\n* bar soap: any kind\n* shampoo bar: for this I use three different kinds, a brand that onlyu sells in a shop around the corner of my house, [ko essential](https://www.koessential.com/) and [arbol verde](https://arbolverde.com.mx/#https://arbolverde.com.mx/#!/tienda) shampoo bars.\n* toothbrushes: [bamboo toothbrushes](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/cepillo-dental-equate-de-bamboo-cerdas-suaves/00750649500263) from said shop or from soriana (when I can go)\n* luffa: sold on another pop shop near my house or in [Soriana](https://www.soriana.com/3m-nexcare-esponja-de-bano-fibras-naturales-1-pieza/2027366.html)/Aurrer\u00e1. You can also crochet your own with some ixtle threads using granny squares\n* toothpaste: currently using up my toothpaste for sensitive teeth in order to buy a [new one](https://muyme.mx/) in a market near my college. It's more expensive, but I think it's worth it. \n* [menstrual cup](http://www.angelcup.mx): sold everywhere now. I'm planning on geting a new one once mine stops working\n* bidet: Bought a hose from aliexpress and Installed it myself on my bathroom, best buy ever. Although, had I known it was just a hose, i'd have gotten it from my local hardware store\n* reusable toilet cloths: bought a 50 pack from amazon (not very ecofriendly) but I couldn't find anything of the sort anywhere else. haven't used toilet paper since. \n* razors: don't use it often, but I have a stainless steel razor, and every once in a while i'll buy my 100pack blades from aliexpress because those aren't sold here and split it with a friend, I also have an electric razor.\n* deodorant: currently using an alum stone with peta approved vegan paraben free [dove deodorant](https://www.dove.com/us/en/p/vitamin-care-lavender-chamomile.html/00079400509093), but planning on buying one with no packaging when it runs out.\n* cream: I don't really use cream so I don't know why i have it, it comes in plastic but it's sort of like a jar.\n\n>wishlisted items: wall mounted solid soap grater/dispenser, and some silicone holders for my things. I don't know if there is a bar moisturizer but i'd want some, and those toothbrush tablets. bamboo floss maybe? but I don't really floss ( I should)\n\n**KITCHEN**\n\nThe kitchen situation is strange because, i have some things i buy in bulk but others have to get from the grocery store which usually come in plastic. I also have some alternatives to certain utensils and things I have to avoid plastic. so I'll be dividing it into categories. Most of the shops I talk about are in the street next to my house, or near me, since I don't own any vehicles.\n\n**Food**\n\n* chicken: I don't usually buy meat, but when I do, I try to get chicken from **BACHOCO** (usually chicken) and just boil it down, I save the bones when buying any type of chicken and store them in the freezer for when I want to make bone broth. I have cats so it's good for them and I take care of street wildlife so they don't puncture their throats with said bones. \n* eggs: I have a designated [basket](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/canasta-para-huevo-top-choice-forma-de-gallina/00489185685339?from=/search) for eggs, totally unnecessary buy but I bring it with me every time I go out for eggs, which I get in **BACHOCO** at 2USD the kg (13-15 large eggs) so they don't come in carboard or plastic!\n* fruits and vegetables: I like getting them from my local verduler\u00eda, but they're more expensive and only accept cash. I take a bag with me to get them.\n* spices and bulk items: local bulk shop things like parmesan are cheaper than even costco, and all spices cost like, cents. \n* meat aternatives: I like to buy chata soy chorizo and textured soy chorizo and prepare (the last one) with some knorr suiza. that's powdered chicken broth (or so it says)\n* powdered milk mixed with water and normal milk: It lasts and tastes good (i only drink with Ice and coffe or chocolate, so the cold is not an issue) can be any brand. except aurrer\u00e1 milk, it's awful.\n* popcorn: I make myself, a dollar half a kg in my local bulk store, and powdered flavor packets from **Willys**\n\n**Utensils**\n\nMost of the utensils I use are either metal or wood, but I still use some plastic\n\n* tuppers: I don't own many, I use [cream or yogurt packaging](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/crema-acida-lala-entera-426-ml/00750102056190?from=/search), because It's lightweight, the same brand owns everything (lala or alpura) so they all fit together two sizes, and reuse jars for things like homemade pesto.\n* metal mixing bowls: I just use them as regular bowls\n* metal/wood utensils. bought probably in **aurrer\u00e1**\n* stainless steel pan: it's so pretty\n* cotton towels: bought in **aurrer\u00e1** or [parisina](https://www.laparisina.mx/default/toalla-facial-bali-hueso/)\n* water jugs: are made of plastic but can be refilled\n* metal drying rack\n\n>wishlisted Items: some metal trays for baking, maybe? and those magnetic spice jars, or magnetic anything, i love magnets for space usageee, I'm also planning on learning how to sew and wax clothes for making food wraps and cloth bags for bulk shopping. a metal mesuring cup and metal cups! I LOVE METAL\n\n**Cleaning**\n\n* sponges: submerge in vinegar and they smell like new! They're still plastic, but I buy ones more [resistant to wear](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/esponja-3m-scotch-brite-superficies-delicadas/00750102312859?from=/search) and they have lasted me a year or so, and use regular cleaning sponges (haven't used my entire pack yet) for drying after cleaning.\n* [curb detergent containers](https://listado.mercadolibre.com.mx/suavitel-10-litros): I don't really buy detergent or softener, so sometimes I see these jugs on the street and pick them up, I currently have two, with vinegar and jabon zote mix respectively.\n* [jabon zote](https://despensa.bodegaaurrera.com.mx/ip/jabon-zote-en-barra-blanco-400-g/00750102600537?from=/search): this thing is a life changer. Its a regular soap, only has three ingredients, cow lard, lye and this flower that smells citrusy. Its a giant block of soap I use for washing the dishes by rubbing it directly on the sponge, and for washing clothes, I'll grate it and boil it with a lot of water and some sodium bicarbonate, and pout into a container. I don't do this often\n* vinegar: use it for mold, as softener, and for rinsing sponges.\n* diatomaceous earth: good against bugs and isn't harmful or has any synthetic chemicals.\n* sodium bicarbonate: mix with lemon and remove any oil stains.\n* rags: they're always useful. \n\nfor laundry, I take a small jar with my handmade detergent and go to a laundry shop, and air dry in my yard. \n\n>wishlist: natural sponges or brush for dishes, more containers so I can pile them up, and store more things inside, ethylic alcohol, and oxigenated water for sanitizing and bleaching (in a less harsh way).\n\n**Reducing/Reusing/Recycling/:** \n\nfor this section I don't have many products but rather a detailed guide based on the place I live. For trash, I usually separate it into 4 categories, or 5. \n\n* edible food scraps: things like food about to be bad, I freeze, and use it for later.\n* compost: anything organic or that can decompose, This includes leaves and all food scraps., i put them in the compost bin and then dump them in my backyard.\n* recyclables: My city accepts the following. I made this little infography to put in my fridge. As you can see, it's a lot, I think they sell it. But there's people that come pick it up at your house and sell it themselves. They also pick pizza boxes. I don't usually separate the plastic bags because I don't kknow the difference and I don't want to cause problems by wishcycling on accident, so it put them in the next category. they have many specific instructions for these, so usually I wash what needs to be washed, let it dry and crush it. And have it in a box somewhere until someone comes pick it up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs96nmf2skre1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b1a919762e41fc70bd3b2602c4717b5e28b842f\n\n* clean non-recyclables: pieces of tooth floss, tape, some packaging, you name it and place them inside of the largets pet container i can find. plastic bags (the ones that food come in, I reuse for cat litter disposal, and grocery bags (when my roomies get them), i use to make plarn and knit useful things with.\n* dirty non-recyclables. in the trash. I have three roommates and we get out like a bag of trash every week or every other week. \n\n>wishlist: proper recycling bins\n\n**transport + some abilities:**\n\nI usually use public transport or carpool, it's cheaper and great way to make friends. I take with me my metal water cup and some utensils, just in case, and an umbrella for not getting sunburnt. most of the time I walk though.\n\n  \nIf you want to be better at repurposing things or being crafty/using the most of what you own, you can learn how to sew, for any pieces of cloth you have, or knit/crochet, you can use [anything](https://youtu.be/ZQMQH7PoHqU) as yarn. If you buy certain products often, like maruchan, dog food or cat litter, you can use the packaging to [make baskets](https://ruutupunontaa.fi/en/) for organizing your home or selling made of those upcycled materials.

She knows what \u201cpotty pad\u201d means and will land-seal over to the nearest one. \n\nAnyways, I would love to hear any tips and advice on helpful routines, methods, or products to integrate into our situation. \n\nThings we have done so far:\n\n- All solid waste disposal uses biodegradable materials: paper bags, poop bags, paper towels. \n- If the weather is not too hot, we put solid waste in with the compost (edit: \u201corganic waste\u201d) bin outside. (Hot weather == smell. We don\u2019t want to bother nearby neighbors)\n- Phase out remaining disposable potty pads with washable pads. The new pads are great but the majority I\u2019ve found for sale are some form of plastic. \n- Accumulate as many small rags and large towels specifically for dog mess cleanup\n- Use a steamer machine to deep clean hard floors.\n- my other dachshunds are otherwise able to go potty in an enclosed area of our yard that we clean up regularly.\n- Switched to a high efficiency washing machine for all of my extra dog laundry. Lucked out on this one as the old machine kicked the bucket anyway.\n- Not disabled-dog specific, but I try to buy food and treats locally and in bulk, using reusable containers and bags. \n\n\nIssues to solve:\n\n- We still use a swiffer to quickly clean up a mess before it dries into the floor. I\u2019ve had washable sponges for mops but you can only salvage them for so long. And the constant refilling of a mop bucket throughout the day became impractical. \n- We go through a ton of paper towels. They\u2019re good for poop pickup and absorbing urine puddles. I need to just get in the habit of grabbing a rag or towel for urine. But poop pickup is easier with paper towels. \n- All of the cleaning products we use come in plastic bottles (Nature\u2019s miracle). Even the refill containers. I haven\u2019t come up with a DIY mixture I like. We have tile and wood flooring. \n\nI know folks have strong feelings about the ecological impact of companion animals. If all the advice you have is just brow beating about the waste my paralyzed wiener dog is producing, please just sit on your hands for this one.\n\nEdit: Should have said \u201corganic waste bin\u201d instead of compost.

{"title": "Update on New Year\u2019s Resolution - Two Months Progress", "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nI'm back again with my second month of progress towards my New Year's Resolution of swapping all of my cosmetic and hygiene products to plastic free and zero waste alternatives. I have expanded to household cleaning products, dried pantry staples, and produce as well.\n\nHere's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1in9a97/update_on_new_years_resolution_one_month_progress/) to last month's post. In summary, I swapped to:\n\n* Kitsch shampoo and conditioner bars\n* Bar soap\n* Vico deodorant\n* Compostable q tips\n* Dropped make-up remover wipes\n\nSwapped this month:\n\n* Powder dishwasher detergent. Works fine. I forget the name. I just got the only one they had at Target.\n* Pantry staples from bulk bins. I was so excited to learn about the refill store near me!! They only have dried foods, no cleaning supplies, but it's certainly a step in the right direction! Rice, beans, nuts, etc covered from here on.\n* Lush plastic-free mascara. Honestly would not recommend. Maybe it's useful for people with blond eyelashes? They really only change the color. Absolutely zero lengthening/thickening involved. The good news is it washes off with plain water. Bad news is it runs down my face while I'm wearing it.\n* Cloth menstrual pads. I bought two from the local eco-friendly store to try out before making my own and test their absorbancy/pattern to know what to expect. They only carried GladRags, so I got one day pad and one night pad. I haven't gotten to try them just yet.\n* Cloth cleaning rags. I was basically already doing this, but there were many instances I was reaching for the paper towels when I should have reached for the rags. My roommates use paper towels, so they're right there on the counter. Just focusing on not giving in to convenience and using them.\n* Cloth napkins. Just using kitchen towels for this atm. Might snag some actual cloth napkins if I find some at the thrift store.\n\nDropped this month:\n\n* Plastic-packaged produce. Ex) plastic bag of potatoes, plastic bag of greens, etc. Only buying \"naked\" produce now. This seems obvious, I know, and I was already sort of doing this before, but I'm just really committing from now on. The hardest thing to drop was bagged salad mixes. Also my grocery store doesn't carry some things plastic free, like leafy greens, celery, grapes, etc. So I've had to adjust my diet a bit.\n\nFailed swap:\n\n* Lush plastic-free mascara. Will absolutely not repurchase. I'm dreading how long what I have will last.\n\nSwaps I plan to make next:\n\n* Powder detergent in cardboard for washing machine. Will probably be at least a couple months before I run out of the bulk liquid I have.\n* Bidet. I had one in a place I used to live, but it was cold water which was...not pleasant lol. I'd love to get a nice heated one soon. If you have a recommended brand, I'd love to hear it.\n* Eco-friendly toilet paper. I found this useful tool for toilet paper brands https://www.nrdc.org/stories/best-worst-tissue-brands. Trader Joe's tissue itself has a great score, but the packaging is plastic. Considering Aria, but I don't have a local vendor so I'd have to ship from Amazon. Much to consider.\n\nMiscellaneous other progress:\n\n* I realized that coffee grounds/filter are compostable, I realize this is dumb, but it just went right over my head before. Let me know if you had anything like this!\n* I wanted to buy some new microfiber hair turbans for the gym showers, but I realized that some old race shirts that don't fit anymore worked just fine, so now I use those.\n\nOf course, I'm finishing what I have at home first, with a couple exceptions. Exceptions are things like some tampons I'm keeping around in case of emergencies.\n\nSo yeah, that's my two-month progress! Thanks everyone for your tips and suggestions last month!

I very rarely wrap gifts, maybe 1 or 2 a year (yes, I know I can use it for gift wrap). No one I know have birds, guinea pigs, etc. I know people who have these pets often use paper for them. So I have no one to pass it along too. There's no children in my life to pass it along with crafting, coloring, etc. \n\nI do like it cook and bake, crochet, etc. So what does everyone use the paper for or do you just throw it away? It just seems like a waste. \n\nAs far as the boxes I cut them apart and make custom cake boards (I cover them with food safe wrapping). I use them for storage containers, etc.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for some great ideas! I do a bit of container gardening on my patio and I'll incorporate some of the paper. Using it during messy tasks around the apartment is a good idea, using it as note paper and wrapping paper is great and I wonder if I could use it under a cooling rack to catch grease when I fry/make bacon/etc.\n\nEdit #2: Thank you so much for all of the wonderful ideas.

{"title": "Can reusing glass packaging not solve a significant amount of waste issue?", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI live in the UK, and there is a massive problem with recycling here which I have been thinking about. \n\nBasically majority of the recycling waste isn\u2019t actually worth recycling, they either go to incinerator or landfill, here or in another country. It\u2019s simply not working. \n\nMost of the recycling waste in our house comes from food packaging and bottles. So I have this dream, where a government makes it mandatory to have the same size/shape glass containers for certain food products and instead of recycling, these containers get cleaned and reused. \n\nFor example, instead of 330ml cans, all drink companies must get their head together, decide on a certain type of 330ml glass bottle and only use that for that amount of their product. They can differ their products with low-environmental impact stickers that comes off easily, and the lid but the main part stays the same. These then get collected and washed and reused. Same for other size bottles, alcoholic drinks etc. They all have to go into the same bottle. \n\nAnd, all ready meal companies must pick the same square container of certain size for their product. All jars, fruits, cheese, butter, milk\u2026 everything that comes in plastic, can also go in a glass container to be then cleaned and reused. \n\nThis can be extended to cleaning products, chemicals, soap/shampoo bottles\u2026 you get the picture. \n\nInstead of burning or burying all the plastic, and smashing the glass to melt and reshape, it would be just cleaning. \n\nChanges would need to be made to collect these without damaging them much. Obviously it would be expensive and difficult in the beginning, but overtime once the infrastructure is there, a significant amount of plastic waste would be replaced by glass, and cleaned and resold to manufacturers who then just need to put their label on the lid.\n\nWhy is this not a part of the solution?

{"title": "Update on New Year\u2019s Resolution - One Month Progress", "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nI thought it might be fun to go over the progress I've made towards my New Year's Resolution of swapping all of my cosmetic and hygiene products to plastic free and zero waste alternatives by the end of the year.\n\nOf course, I am using up all of the things I already have first, so it may be some time before I get around to each swap. Especially since some things were bought in bulk.\n\nSwaps I have already made:\n\n* Kitsch shampoo and conditioner bars. Not entirely zero waste as they do have paperboard packaging, but certainly better than plastic bottles. And truly, my hair has never looked or felt better! I have fine, wavy hair and I've been using the rice protein one.\n* (Vico) bar soap. I wasn't entirely out of body wash when I purchased this, but I went ahead and got it to get free shipping on the deodorant. I've relegated the rest of my body wash to my gym bag. (I shower at the gym twice a week, so it will get used.) It's good. It's soap. Came with no wrapper packaging, which is good, but I had to get it shipped to me, so it had a box. I wouldn't bother purchasing it again. I will instead just get soap from a local seller at the farmer's market.\n* Vico deodorant. This is part of an ongoing saga of finding a deodorant that doesn't make me smell like a barn animal. Twice now I've found one that worked only for it to undergo a formula change or be discontinued. This one works pretty good, but I have to reapply throughout the day. I've also tried Native plastic free deodorant, which made me smell exponentially worse than wearing nothing at all. Fortunately it worked great for my partner. After I finish, I plan to try Ethique. Hopefully it has better lasting power. Sadly I can't use aluminum deodorant due to prolonged exposure contact dermatitis (dermatologist confirmed). \n* \\*Bamboo q tips. I know I know I know. You're \"not supposed to use q tips\". But I TRIED cutting them out for the last two months and actually for the first time in my life had to go to the doctor for an earwax extraction because my right ear was fully blocked. So I switched to fully compost-able bamboo/cotton q tips in compost-able packaging and will endeavor to use them less frequently.\n\nStopped using and did not replace:\n\n* Make-up remover wipes. Honestly, I miss these a lot. Often after washing off my make-up, I'm still left with racoon eyes (even after using an oil cleanser). The easiest fix for this was a tearing off a little strip of a make-up remover wipe. I am hoping someone may have a suggestion for maybe some sort of make-up remover/micellar water tablets that can be dissolved in water that I can use with a cloth, or whatever other solution people use.\n\nFailed swap:\n\n* I bought an off brand water pic. It literally does nothing and now I'm suck with this useless device that I have no idea what to do with and I still have to use dental floss. Looking for more eco-friendly floss suggestions.\n\nSwaps I plan to make next:\n\n* Lush mascara. I'm hoping it works. I'm a bit worried about shipping because they warn against temperature damage in transport, but the closest Lush to me if 4 hours away. If anyone has a recommendation for another company, I'd be interested! \n* Cloth menstrual pads. I'm planning to make these myself from some old clothes that don't fit anymore using a pattern I found free online. I bought a menstrual cup, but it caused me so much pain and leaked so badly, I'm scared to try it again.\n\nSo yeah, that's my long-winded summary of my progress so far this year. I'd love to hear any suggestions y'all may have.

{"title": "Bar Shampoo", "selftext": "So I was looking for advice from people and this seems to be the main reddit that has talk of shampoo bars so I will post this here. So I have been using bar shampoo for... maybe 3 years now. I always get it from a local soap maker. I had cut my hair shortly after starting using bar shampoo so I didn't have long hair for long while using it. I currently have long hair again and most of the time I find my bar shampoo is fine, though I do keep a bottle of clarifying shampoo for if I let my hair go for to long without a wash. So that's a bit of the back story now onto why I have went looking for advice. So this past month I have been depressed and let my hair washing go longer then usual. I usually was it every 2 weeks but I let it go a month.... part of it was lack of energy the other was the weather has been so cold and dry, I use a boar bristle brush to distribute sebum and my ends needed it, they keep freezing at work from condensation of my breath. I then put coconut oil on my ends before I washed my hair for a few hours. It is the first time using oil on my hair then removing it with a bar shampoo. My nephew had used all my clarifying shampoo and I haven't replaced it. I figured I would need to work a bit harder to get it out but was up to the task. I went through 3 washes and when I was rinsing out my conditioner I could tell my hair was still greasy.\n\nSo the question is am I asking to much from my bar shampoo or do I need a better one? I don't know anyone else that uses it so I only have my experience with this one bar I have been getting for years. In the past I have wanted a bit more from it but also partially figured it might be the fact it's just a bar shampoo. If you have one that is potentially a better option I would love to know what people use and their opinions on it. \n\nSorry I know this is a lot of hair talk for a subreddit thats not necessarily hair but also it's about my hair and a product that likely more people on a zero waste subreddit would know about.

{"title": "Advice for Mouth Guards", "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying: I know that when it comes to medical issues that we can't (and shouldn't) compromise. That said, there are some alternatives out there and I want to know y'all's experience with them, to determine the best path forward.\n\nI recently had a sleep study done and discovered that I grind my teeth in my sleep. The solution for grinding is mouth guards, which are predominantly plastic. Aside from the environmental issues with plastic, I'm not in love with the idea of grinding plastic down with my teeth every night and swallowing the subsequent microscopic particles. (Guess this depends on whether or not mouth guards completely stop teeth grinding or just protect your teeth from the grinding, probably depends on the exact guard.)\n\nThere are EVA plastic mouthguards, which don't have BPA, BPS, and phthalates in them, so those would be my choice if I end up deciding that plastic is the best option. \n\nI've found woven hemp mouth guards, which you boil in the morning to disinfect, but I'm unsure about their design and am wondering if anyone has had experience with them. Here's the link to the ones I found: https://answersbynature.com/products/original-mouthguard \n\nI found one that is made of 100% medical grade silicon, but it's more for sports. That said, I've seen some reviews that say it works well for bruxism (teeth grinding) as well. Here's the link for the one I'm looking at: https://www.shockdoctor.com/products/braces-mouthguard?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&variant=14354235228213&utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Skimlinks&clickId=15736469&cjevent=bc4a9185dd8e11ef81b8ac480a82b824\n\nI also found a a really interesting one, again for sports, that's made of biodegradable plastic. The statement they have about their material and what biodegradable means seems earnest, and even goes as far as to explain the lack of standardization in determining biodegradability. (They are a bit off when they say that fungi will break down the plastic in a landfill, as it's actually microbes that will break down the plastic anaerobically, which causes the release of methane, but they tried.) Here's the link for this brand: https://www.sisuguard.com/\n\nThere are also more standard-looking hemp and natural rubber options from Natural Mouth Guard and Natural Mouth Guards, respectively, but both are in the starting stages so they are not available for immediate purchase. I reached out about purchasing one to the former of the two, so I'm hoping to hear back from them.\n\nWith all of this said, I'm interested to know y'all's experience with any of these products. Additionally, if you've gone the plastic route, I would like to know which ones you found the most long-lasting.\n\nIn a perfect world I would test each of these, starting with the most sustainable one, but unfortunately I really don't have the funds to try more than two.\n\nThanks in advance for y'all's help! \n\nP.S.

{"title": "Ideas for Encouraging Students to Be Sustainable at School", "selftext": "\nI've come up with three ideas to encourage students to reduce, reuse, and recycle, in that order.\n\nReduce: Give a student a reward if they manage to finish all or most of their lunch instead of wasting it. A sticker board will be put up in the cafeteria with the names of each student. Every day, every student who finished all or most of their lunch will be given a sticker. A teacher or lunch monitor will be in charge of keeping track. The rewards can be anything the school sees fit like extra recess time, school-wide recognition, school supplies, or gift cards for higher grades.\n\nReuse: Organize regular art and craft sessions where students can create new items from the collected materials like sculptures, toys, decorations, and functional items like storage containers. Host competitions where students can showcase their creations, with categories like \"Most Creative,\" \"Best Use of Materials,\" and \"Most Functional.\u201d Display the projects in a school exhibition or gallery to celebrate the students' efforts and spread awareness.\n\nRecycle: Each recycling bin is a different color depending on the recycled material. Each time a student finishes their lunch, they take a turn trying to throw their recyclable trash right into the bin. Each successful throw into the correct bin earns one point. You could even add bonus points for students who properly sort multiple items at once. A student volunteer or lunch monitor will keep track of the points. At the end of lunch, the one with the highest score has their name up on the board as the Recycle Master for the rest of the day. Consider offering small eco-friendly prizes, like reusable water bottles or tote bags, for weekly or monthly top scorers.\n\nWhat do you think of these ideas?

I have a problem with companies like Tony's Chocolonely who still choose to buy cacao from West Africa - you cannot make a sustainable product out of such a complex system, where millions of families are employed and deforestation in a bigger issue. plus, in order to support the farmers, you have to pay a premium price for your chocolate bar (Tony's is actually very cheap, considering it comes is 180 gr. bars). a striking move would be to break away from the West Africa supplies, making smaller batches and sourcing from different countries.\n\n  \ncraft chocolate makers directly buy their cacao from estates and cooperatives, providing you with precise data about it on the wrappers (most of the times). you'll find pieces of information on the number of farmers involved, the cooperative's/estate's name and location, the cacao variety, the altitude... all of this by paying a big premium price for the beans, that come in small or micro batches. makers often travel to the places where the source cacao from (if they aren't already locals), investing in a number of initiatives with positive outcomes. \n\n  \nregarding the cacao quality, each batch is different, even within the same region. farmers all over the world harvest cacao from finer genetics that naturally posess bright and strong tasting notes (it's up to the makers to choose what to enhance and how). the dark chocolate you find in stores has been roasted to the point it tastes burnt: this is why most people get the idea that dark chocolate is bitter. truth is chocolate can have very different and peculiar tasting notes: it can be very fruity, creamy and dairy-like, herbal and robust, spicy... without any added flavour. I've had 100% with very low bitterness!\n\n  \nthe depth of the flavour profile also allow consumers to eat less chocolate in order to feel satisfied! while bars are smaller (they usually come in 50 gr. bars, maybe 70 gr. at times), you only need to take a little piece and let it melt on your tongue to perceive a stronge taste (+ quality chocolate should have a persistent aftertaste), you probably wouldn't indulge this way. packaging are always made out of paper and most makers are turning to biodegradable and compostable plastic/paper wrappings.\n\n  \nhere you see some bars that confirm everything I've said. the brands are Luisa Abram, Mesti\u00e7o, Krak, Feitoria do Cacao and Original Beans :) let's eat less, buy better and change the chocolate market!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1i84js0/bean_to_bar_chocolate_sustainable_and_impactful/", "created_utc": 1737642449.0, "score": 159, "author": "prugnecotte", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1i84js0/bean_to_bar_chocolate_sustainable_and_impactful/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

If we **eat healthy** and stay healthy, this can **prevent medical waste** in the future.\n\n*  I sometimes buy **single bananas**.  These are often found off to one side of the banana display in the supermarket.  If nobody buys these, they end up in the store's dumpster.

A final \"uh oh\" moment was seeing a study about how much plastic is transferred to food from plastic cutting boards a while back.\n\nI'm in the process of slowing getting rid of my plastic meal prep tubs/tupperware containers in favor of glass and metal, switching to wooden cutting boards, etc. Obviously it's wasteful to dispose of perfectly good working stuff, so I'm just rotating new things in as the plastic things wear out.\n\nMy question is: I know \"plastic recycling\" is largely a myth, so I'm wondering how I can most easily and effectively get rid of the old plastic items mentioned above (Tupperware, cutting boards, etc). Are there facilities that actually DO recycle plastics, or am I just SOL here?\n\nCheers!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1hzw020/trying_to_reduce_plastic_usage_how_to_dispose_of/", "created_utc": 1736713484.0, "score": 4, "author": "Afro-Pope", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1hzw020/trying_to_reduce_plastic_usage_how_to_dispose_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
