{"title": "For the love of god, please stop bashing American Chinese food as \"fake\" or \"inauthentic\" [Rant]", "selftext": "As a second gen Chinese American myself, I am really tired of people being a complete snob over authenticity to the point that they distort the history and culture behind Chinese cuisine.\n\nI've had enough of people trashing American Chinese food as \"not the real thing\" or even worse, \"Chinese food dumbed down for American people\" (like WTF?!)\n\nWhile I don't deny that Chinese food in America is different from Chinese food on the mainland, that  doesn't make it any less worthy. Sure, it has been changed to some extent to suit local palates, but that's pretty much the same thing with Chinese food in the diaspora in general. There is also Indonesian Chinese, Filipino Chinese, Singaporean Chinese, and even Peruvian Chinese  food-yet nobody calls these variants as \"fake\" or \"inauthentic\". \n\nMoreover, people had to make adaptations to the cuisine anyways in the new land due to the lack of available ingredients that they usually had back home.  No Chinese broccoli? Use western broccoli instead. \n\n One has to remember that Chinese cuisine is by no means a monolith- it's pretty diverse with a lot of regional variations-hence Beijing cuisine is different from Shanghai cuisine and Cantonese cuisine. A lot of early Chinese immigrants to the US were from the Guangdong province, hence American Chinese food is heavily based on the cuisine from that area (albeit still a limited representation).  This is the reason why later immigrants from other parts of China might find American Chinese cuisine to be strange and completely foreign. \n\nI always have to chuckle whenever someone tries hard to demonstrate what \"authentic\" and \"inauthentic\" Chinese food is by comparing a Chinese takeout dish with Cantonese origins (ie, chow mein or orange chicken) to a dish from another region in China, which is essentially comparing apples to oranges. A good example would be this [Buzzfeed video](https://youtu.be/8vMOESJwWsg) in which the host claims to try \"authentic\" sweet and sour pork for the first time, when in reality the version that she tried is no less \"authentic\" than the one she is used to. Only difference is that the so-called \"authentic\" version is another regional variation, just like the Cantonese-style sweet and sour pork many are familiar with. \n\nWhile I do appreciate people willing to take a deeper look into Chinese cuisine beyond the menu at the local takeout, there's no need to be an utter snob about it. Food is food, peeps. It's high time that we recognize American Chinese cuisine as something unique of its own.\n\nEDIT: Holy smokes this thread did blow up unexpectedly. I'm seeing a lot of amazing input from various perspectives. Here are a few additional things I want to add\n\n1) While I did mention American Chinese food in the post and title, I was also referring to Chinese food in the western diaspora in general (including Canadian Chinese food, British Chinese food, etc.) \n\n2) Regarding authenticity, yes it is something that does exist, though at the same time it is something that is very subjective. Given the insanely diverse array of Chinese cuisine, it would be disingenuous to pinpoint \"authenticity\" as solely one way of cooking. There's no such thing as \"this is the only way to do it right\". Take Kung Pao chicken for example. While the original version in Sichuan is hot and spicy, there are also other regional versions in China that are less spicy. \n\n3) Some of y'all also talked about how some people bash American/Western Chinese food out of an identity crisis- this especially rings true for a lot of second gen Chinese Americans grappling between two cultures. On one hand, American Chinese food has been looked down on for a very long time due to the perception that it is greasy, sketchy, unhealthy, etc. A lot of second gen Chinese Americans might feel ashamed to be associated with this kind of food, so they overcompensate by going on full board with the authenticity train- trying hard to prove that Chinese food is more than just the takeout menu. A much as I detest the culinary gatekeeping sentiment, I can definitely see where it's coming from. \n\n4) I also find it interesting how a lot of people think of American Chinese food as generally heavy on the grease, starch and sugar. While I do get it's kinda explainable given that general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, and orange chicken are some of the most popular American Chinese dishes, there's also way more to that as well. Heck, even American Chinese cuisine can be vast and diverse! Of course there's also a lot of less greasy, less sugary foods like moo goo gai pan and moo shoo pork. However in my state, Louisiana, there's also yakmein and crawfish fried rice.

The label on the quarter wheel was clearly incorrect, saying that it was .42 pounds, and so was only $10.92. When I went over to the register to see if they would let me actually purchase it, it rung up as it showed on the label, and the cashier let me buy it! When I got home, it weighed 23 pounds! At $25.99/pound, that's $600 of cheese for only $11! I'm planning on giving a lot of it away to friends and family. I've cut it into ~1 lb chunks, vacuum sealed them, and split them between the fridge and freezer. What recipes should I make with my haul???\n\nTLDR: Got an incredible deal on 23 lbs of parmesan cheese for only $11. What should I make?\n\nEdit: photos https://imgur.com/a/23-lb-cheese-AEZcewy\n\nEdit 2: To be clear, during the check out process the cashier was very aware that this was an absurd price for this large wheel of cheese, and had no qualms about ringing it up as it is. Also, if you look at the website for Murray's Cheese, you will notice that they are absolutely not a Mom & Pop shop, but have hundreds of locations across the USA.\n\nEdit 3: To add some context, I actually arrived at the register without the cheese, and when the cashier asked \"anything else?\" I made a joke about \"not unless you'll actually sell me that quarter wheel of cheese for $11!\" She said \"bring it over!\" so I did, and when it rang up as $11 dollars and I was in shock, she made multiple jokes about it being 11 million dollars.

I tried Beyond Meat at a fast food place and it tasted like an overseasoned paste that left regret on my tongue for the rest of the day. \n\nVegetarian foods in America try to replace meat. MorningStar is never going to replace a prime rib with black beans. But it won't stop them from trying.\nThis is in direct contrast with asian foods (the other half of my heritage). Where vegetable dishes seem integrated into cultural norms. Hinduism and Indian food for instance. Or Thai foods, Chinese foods have vegetables take up the entire dish. These foods also are heavily influenced by auxiliary tastes. Instead of the beef talking, its aromatic spices and insanely hot peppers.\n\nI'm making sweeping generalizations. But I wonder if it's possible to create foods that are not simply lesser imitations of what you really want (fake chicken nuggies) but a mainstay dish. And if it is possible to make it simple enough for an American pallette and accessible to cooks who don't have much time. Maybe there are and I don't know about them.\n\nTL;DR Is it possible to create true vegetable focused dishes in the USA that arent trying to replace meat as the star of any given meal.\n\nEdit: Thank you for your thoughtful replies and rewards. I'll try to get to your comments!\n\nEdit 2: I want to say I do not think that vegetarians are trying to substitute meat for everything. My vegan guest certainly didn't do that and didn't throw tofu in everything to attempt to cover for meat. u/Whoisdecoy shared this in the comments and I think this guy does a much better job explaining: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mYcsM05lDk&feature=youtu.be&t=279", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jqwjzp/i_believe_most_of_american_vegetarian_foods_are/", "created_utc": 1604924098.0, "score": 11845, "author": "dreimanatee", "num_comments": 1081, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jqwjzp/i_believe_most_of_american_vegetarian_foods_are/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Unpopular opinion: Jamie Oliver is misunderstood", "selftext": "It\u2019s become very popular to bash Jamie Oliver these days, with the fried rice incidents of his. People are (rightfully) pointing out how that his food is not authentic this or authentic that. And the outrage seems to be exacerbated by the UK\u2019s long and horrible history of colonialism. Like, \u00abyou stole our spices and now you butcher our food\u00bb. But I think people are judging him on the wrong premise. I don\u2019t think making authentic dishes has ever been his point. Most people in the UK are very normal working class people with poor diets. Whose worlds are their local communities, and they do what they can to get by. And these normal, busy people are Oliver\u2019s target group. He\u2019s a champion when it comes to public health, and his goal is to get the public to make their own food and eat healthier. For them, chilli jam and soy sauce is probably exotic enough. So adding soy sauce to a dish makes it \u00abAsian\u00bb. Because that\u2019s how it is to the people he\u2019s speaking to. Had he gone full authentic, it wouldn\u2019t have served the purpose at all, as nobody would have bothered. His shows aren\u2019t meant for British Asians with a strong knowledge of the cuisine of their country of origin. And I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s offensive or wrong.\n\nI\u2019m a massive foodie, and I would never go to Jamie if I wanted to learn how to make for example pad thai.

I see that I've opened a whole new world.  I just stood in the asian grocery store and I saw what brand an asian person chose and I just chose that one. No regrets.\n\nThis was the brand:\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/images/20110304-kimchi-taste-test-bing-gre.jpg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/j0qukb/i_just_tried_kimchi_for_the_first_time_is_it/", "created_utc": 1601212225.0, "score": 9726, "author": "BallsOfANinja", "num_comments": 1025, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/j0qukb/i_just_tried_kimchi_for_the_first_time_is_it/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I hate butterbells and I can never tell my wife. I have to get this off my chest.", "selftext": "My wife LOVES the butterbell. If you don't know, it's a cup that holds butter and it sits upside-down in a larger cup of water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. It \"solves\" a problem that doesn't exist. It's supposed to prevent the butter from going bad in a traditional butter dish by creating a seal with the water. Never once have I seen butter go bad in a dish. That doesn't happen in a normal household that uses butter. The butterbell makes it more likely to go bad because now it's floating in water which harbors bacteria. The bell can't be considered \"sealed\" if you're using it frequently to scoop out butter, probably getting breadcrumbs in there and touching it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. It's second failure is in keeping it soft. The water is supposed to act as an insulator to keep the butter from getting cold. But it's very little water. Not much insulating power. My house has a furnace. It's a steady temperature inside. The butter wouldn't get hard on the counter even without the butterbell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Floaters. Often there are little bits of butter that fall out and float around in the water. You're not putting that slimy wet butter on your toast. That bit is getting thrown out when you clean the butterbell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Cleaning. The butterbell needs to be cleaned before you load it again. Both parts tend to get messy. Put it in the dishwasher and take it out 12-24 hrs later you're ready to load it again except wait-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- (of course the butter dish also needs cleaning but the next part is what makes the cleaning so aggravating)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Loading it with butter. You can't  load it with cold butter from the fridge. Did you remember to take it out and let it warm up first? No? Okay so now that the bell is cleaned you can put a stick of butter on the counter until it's soft. But it's dinner time and you just chopped the onions. you don't have time to mess with that: you need some butter now ready to go, so you take some butter right off the stick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Now that you have some time to load it up you grab a butter knife and scoop it in. This part is fun actually. Smushing it all up in there and swirling the butter knife just right to give it a little spiral shape. But the bell holds somewhere between 1 and 2 sticks so\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Get another half a stick out? Or just use what you have in the butterbell until you repeat the process? Or leave out a full 2nd stick to soften but only load half? Seems like you can never get just the right amount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. You can't fit the spatula into the bell to scoop out butter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. The water will sometimes slosh out of the bell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. With all this hassle, most of the time the butter just sits in the wrapper on the counter raising the question: Why do we even need the bell?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for all the hate. Thank you for listening to me. My wife loves the thing because it's cute and it's ceramic. For her that's all that matters. I can't tell her I hate it because it will break her sweet heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: #11 - Now I'm  reading that you're supposed to change the water every 2-3 days?

It details 8 methods for preserving and protecting foods, and it's a follow-up to my post last week on [acidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/m06qvh/acidity_is_not_a_single_flavor/).\n\n^(Disclaimer: This post was written while consulting reams of regulatory and industrial food safety documents, but I\u2019m not an expert. If you disagree with anything, please comment with a source so I can research further. Thanks!)\n\n# WHY CARE ABOUT FOOD SAFETY?\n\nThe CDC estimates that foodborne illnesses cause 48 million people to become sick, 128 thousand people to become hospitalized, and 3 thousand people to die each year in the US alone.\n\nThese illnesses occur after harmful microorganisms (e.g. molds, bacteria, and parasites) or viruses (e.g. norovirus) contaminate food. Norovirus, salmonella, and clostridium perfringens are the most common known pathogens each year, and foodborne illness from *unknown* pathogens are four times as common. Meanwhile, illnesses such as botulism are infrequent but deadly.\n\nWhen you consider that the average person in the US is primarily eating consumer goods that have passed the standards of the FDA, these numbers are staggering. With our regular consumption of highly engineered products, it can be easy to carry on without realizing how and why specific foods are safe and for how long.\n\nAs a home cook, you probably deviate from FDA guidelines all the time. But you can only be so ambitious before you drive off the rails of presumed safety and enter dangerous territory. That\u2019s where this guide comes in.\n\n# FOOD SAFETY PROCEDURES\n\nContamination from pathogens that cause food spoilage and foodborne illness can occur prior to, during, or after the cooking process. And contrary to popular belief, many of the worst pathogens cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted.\n\nFood safety procedures are our best defense against these pathogens. They aim to either:\n\n* **Kill or remove** ***existing*** **pathogens in food**. These pose the most immediate risks.\n* **Prevent the growth of** ***new*** **pathogens in food**. This is especially important for foods that you aren\u2019t eating right away (e.g. food you are storing or cooking over multiple hours).\n\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with some food safety best practices (e.g. avoiding the temperature danger zone). But you\u2019re probably also aware of seeming contradictions to those best practices (e.g. *why can bread or jam be kept in the temperature danger zone?*).\n\nIn the content that follows, I attempt to equip you with what you need to know to put it all together and make sense of these seeming contradictions. Specifically, we\u2019ll cover the 4 primary methods for preventing foodborne illness:\n\n1. **With cleanliness**: Some harmful microorganisms and viruses can\u2019t spoil food if you wash them away.\n2. **With temperature control:** Harmful microorganisms and viruses can\u2019t survive at very high temperatures, and microorganisms struggle to survive at very low temperatures.\n3. **With acidity:** Harmful microorganisms can\u2019t grow under highly acidic conditions.\n4. **With water activity**: Harmful microorganisms can\u2019t grow with low water activity.\n\nI\u2019ll detail other methods as well in less detail. The guide will start with the most commonly-used methods, though I have a hunch that the later methods (e.g. water activity) will be more useful to my audience. Let\u2019s do it.\n\n# 1. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH CLEANLINESS\n\nThis is the most boring and obvious food safety method, but stick with me. This method deserves top billing because it is the best means for preventing norovirus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness.\n\nNorovirus primarily spreads through surface-level food contamination (e.g. via fruits and vegetables grown in contaminated water or via shellfish harvested from contaminated water) and people (i.e. others already infected with norovirus). Simply maintaining clean hands, a clean prep station, and clean equipment can make a huge difference in preventing spread of the virus.\n\nNote that this advice does not apply to washing chicken. Washing chicken can actually *increase* bacteria risk (by spreading salmonella to parts of your kitchen that are not typically heated to salmonella-killing temps). Which brings us to...\n\n# 2. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH TEMPERATURE\n\nPathogens struggle to survive at very low or very high temperatures.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new pathogens***\n\nAs a rule of thumb, new harmful microorganisms can only grow between 40\u00baf and 140\u00baf. That\u2019s why we call that range the **temperature danger zone**. Food that is not otherwise preserved should stay out of the temperature danger zone (either warmer or colder). If your food *must* be in the temperature danger zone, it should be there for less than 2 hours total (including the time to warm up or cool down your food).\n\nThat means you can pretty much keep food above 140\u00baf indefinitely without new harmful microorganisms growing. It also means you should keep perishable foods below 40\u00baf, though some common microorganisms can still survive this. Pyschrophiles (which is greek for \u2018cold loving\u2019) can survive up to -4\u00baf, and they are often why your food spoils over time even when it is in the fridge.\n\nIn reality, the stated temperature danger zone includes a margin of error. In California, for example, food safety guidelines deem the temperature danger zone from 41\u00baf to 135\u00baf. In Australian regulations, foods can be kept below 140\u00baf for 4 hours (rather than 2) provided they are used or served immediately.\n\nThe differences lie in risk tolerance. The actual temperature where harmful bacteria fail to grow is closer to 126.1\u00baf, but this temperature is dangerously close to the temperatures where bacteria grow most rapidly. Without a highly calibrated and consistent heating device, keeping your food at that low a temperature is dangerous. For this reason, you\u2019ll often see recommendations where food can be kept at 130\u00baf if cooked sous vide (on a calibrated device) but 140\u00ba otherwise.\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nMany of a food\u2019s existing pathogens will not immediately die if exposed to temperatures below 40\u00baf or higher than 140\u00baf. For that, you generally need either a higher temperature or more time at a controlled temperature.\n\n* **Higher temperature**: Each pathogen has a temperature at which it will immediately die. Salmonella will die when exposed to temperatures exceeding 165\u00baf. That\u2019s why we were traditionally told to cook a chicken to 165\u00baf. Norovirus dies at 145\u00baf. The bacteria that causes botulism can survive temperatures up to 250\u00baf (which is why low acid shelf-stable foods are canned under extreme heat).\n* **Not as high temperature + more time**: If you can hold food at a consistent temperature, you can rely on temperature *and* time to kill microorganisms at a lower overall temp. For example, salmonella will also die when brought to 140\u00baf and then kept at that temperature for 30 minutes (or at 130\u00baf for 6 hours). That\u2019s why we can cook chicken sous vide at lower temperatures than 165\u00baf provided we cook it for long enough. [Here](https://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html)\u2019s an extremely detailed guide if you want to learn more about this time/temp relationship for different foods.\n\nDifferent foods require different temperatures to pasteurize because foods have varying risk levels when it comes to their existing pathogens. Chicken, for example, is highly susceptible to salmonella while beef and fish (and even duck) are not. This is in part because beef and fish generally come from whole-muscle cuts and so are less exposed to surface contamination. Ground beef, meanwhile, is not a whole-muscle cut, and so surface-level pathogens are distributed throughout the meat. Chicken is also more susceptible to salmonella because it is generally raised in nastier conditions than beef, fish, and duck.\n\nKeeping food at sub 40\u00baf temperatures (including below freezing) isn\u2019t a great way to kill existing microorganisms and viruses, because some of the worst bacteria (such as the ones that cause botulism) and norovirus can survive at extremely low temperatures.\n\n***To kill parasites in raw fish***\n\nParasites (such as those found in raw fish) can also survive at low temperatures, but they *do* die after enough time below freezing. Specifically, these parasites die after either 7 days at -4\u00baf or 15 hours at -31\u00baf. Your freezer likely doesn\u2019t go that low.\n\nIn many jurisdictions (even some home to 3 Michelin star sushi restaurants), it is illegal to serve raw fish without freezing it first. Industrial flash-freezers are used by the restaurant industry to freeze fish at extremely fast speeds to maintain quality.\n\nDifferent fish have different parasite risks based on their build and dietary habits. That\u2019s why shellfish, certain species of tuna, and certain types of farm-raised fish are often exempt in jurisdictions where freezing raw seafood is otherwise required.\n\n# 3. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH ACIDITY\n\nHarmful microorganisms cannot grow under highly acidic conditions. This is particularly relevant for sauces, drinks, and fermented foods.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new harmful microorganisms***\n\nAny food substance that measures 4.6 or lower on the pH scale is generally considered acidic enough to prevent growth of harmful microorganisms and can be kept at room temperature.\n\nThis is why you can ignore the temperature danger zone for your vinegars (2.5 pH) and lacto-ferments (3.6 pH) with adequate acidity. While acidophile bacteria (like lactobacillus) grow at this temperature, they are generally safe.\n\nIf you\u2019re making a dressing, hot sauce, or lacto-ferment, it\u2019s worthwhile to measure the pH before you deem the food shelf-stable. Thankfully, measuring pH is easy and pH strips are super cheap.\n\nIf you make a sauce that doesn\u2019t measure to 4.6 pH, you can simply add more vinegar or acid powder until the pH measures low enough.\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nAcidity is not an effective means for killing harmful microorganisms or viruses. Instead, acidity merely slows their flow; as soon as microorganisms are returned to neutral water, they regain mobility.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s a common misconception that ceviche is \u201ccooked\u201d by citrus juice. The proteins are denatured as if they were cooked, but existing bacteria won\u2019t die.\n\n# 4. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH WATER ACTIVITY\n\nHarmful microorganisms cannot grow with low water activity. This is particularly relevant for low acid foods, dried food products, nut butter, miso, garum, ganache, and jams.\n\nWhat\u2019s water activity? It\u2019s not moisture content. Instead, water activity is how free the water in a food is to be utilized by other stuff. Since microorganisms need water to function, when the water in food is bound to other ingredients (such as salt or sugar) in a way that microorganisms can\u2019t utilize it, the microorganisms can\u2019t function. Picture water in a bowl as totally free, but water in a sponge as partially bound by the sponge.\n\n***Measuring water activity***\n\nWater activity can be measured with a machine: a water activity meter. Water activity meters produce an output that is a ratio between 1.0 (high water activity) and 0 (no water activity). A water activity of 1.0 means that the vapor pressure of the food is equal to the vapor pressure of pure water. A water activity of 0.8 means that the food has 80% of the vapor pressure of pure water.\n\nMost foods have a water activity above 0.95. Fresh meat and vegetables have a water activity of 0.99.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new harmful microorganisms***\n\nGenerally, items with a water activity level of 0.85 or lower don\u2019t require refrigeration. Mold growth is still possible (though difficult) at water activity levels as low as 0.6, but the FDA only enforces 0.85. This is why you can store soy sauce (0.8) and peanut butter (0.7) at room temperature.\n\nYou can get away with higher water activity levels if keeping your food out of the temperature danger zone. For long term storage in a fridge, it\u2019s still recommended to keep water activity levels below 0.93 (the level where the bacteria that cause botulism fail to grow).\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nLike acids, low water activity does not kill existing microorganisms or viruses.\n\n***To decrease water activity***\n\nThere are many ways to decrease the water activity of your food:\n\n1. **Adding salt:** Salt is the primary reason why soy sauce is self-stable. Enough salt has been added to soy sauce that the liquid cannot be utilized by harmful pathogens.\n2. **Adding sugar**: Sugar is the primary reason why candies or low-acid jams are shelf-stable.\n3. **Adding other humectants**: Specialized products can decrease water activity without adding saltiness or intense sweetness. Shelf-stable ganache, for example, often utilizes one or more of glucose syrup, sorbitol, dextrose, or glycerol to reduce water activity without making it too sweet.\n4. **Freezing**: Water activity decreases as temperature decreases. Freezing foods will prevent future microorganism growth.\n5. **Removing water content**: Completely removing moisture (e.g. via dehydration or freeze-drying) is a straightforward means to reduce water activity.\n\n***To achieve low water activity without a water activity meter***\n\nWater activity meters are very expensive, but there are multiple methods for safely reducing water activity without a water activity meter. I'm not going to share these here because this is already very long, but feel free to visit my blog if you're interested.\n\n# 5. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH OTHER MEANS\n\nI\u2019ve described the most common methods that home chefs might use to rid their food of unwanted microorganisms and viruses. But there are other food preservation methods as well:\n\n* **Alcohol**: High alcohol percentages destroy bacteria. 70% alcohol is enough to destroy many harmful bacteria upon contact. Lower alcohol percentages will prevent future growth, but the specific percentages for this job are very dependent on other factors.\n* **Packaging techniques**: High temperature canning or aseptic packaging techniques are means to create a hermetically sealed environment where no bacteria exist and no bacteria can enter. These techniques involve sterilizing (via heat in excess of 250\u00baf) both the container and the food inside such that the product can be kept at room temperature until opened. This is essentially the same approach as confit food storage, too.\n* **Osmosis**: Osmosis can destroy certain bacteria. For example, via osmosis, salt helps to destroy certain bacteria in the early days of a lacto-ferment before the acidity has decreased enough to kill the other unwanted bacteria.\n* **Oxygen or lack thereof**: Bacteria and molds are either aerobic (need oxygen) or anaerobic (need absense of oxygen). When you submerge foods in liquids in a lacto-ferment, you\u2019re preventing aerobic bacteria and molds from taking hold. This is partly why a homemade miso might grow mold on the top but not further down. Some of the worst bacteria \u2014 such as those that cause botulism \u2014 are anaerobic, so I\u2019ve added a section on anaerobic environments below.\n\n# ON COMBINING METHODS\n\nThe above techniques can work together to achieve added effectiveness, reduced salinity or acidity, or less stringent temperature requirements. This is how something like shelf-stable low sodium soy sauce is possible. For example, foods with pH of 5.0 are shelf stable when water activity is 0.9 or lower.\n\n# ON ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENTS\n\nBotulism is rare, but it can be fatal \u2014 so it\u2019s worth spending a bit of time on avoiding the contributing bacteria: clostridium botulinum.\n\nClostridium botulinum is anaerobic: it needs the absense of oxygen to survive. Cooking environments that lack oxygen include liquids (e.g. brines or oils), sealed cans, and sous vide bags. Any time you store foods like vegetables (e.g. garlic), fish, and meats in these environments, you need to pay particular attention to time and temperature (or acidity) to prevent clostridium botulinum from taking hold.\n\n***To kill clostridium botulinum***\n\nClostridium botulinum dies at much higher temperatures than other harmful bacteria. To reduce clostridium botulinum to safe levels, bring the food to 250\u00baf (or to 167\u00b0f for 520 minutes, 176\u00b0F for 75 minutes, or 185\u00b0F for 25 minutes).\n\n***To prevent the growth of clostridium botulinum***\n\nThe best way to avoid botulism growth is to keep your food out of the temperature danger zone. This means that storing garlic in olive oil is not a good idea.\n\nEven foods stored in the refrigerator are at risk of future clostridium botulinum growth if the bacteria was not completely destroyed before refrigeration. Foods kept in anaerobic environments should not be kept at at 38\u00b0f for more than 30 days or below 36.5\u00baf for more than 90 days.\n\nAlternatively, you can prevent future bacteria growth by ensuring the food has a pH lower than 4.6. Lacto-fermentation for example is an effective means to prevent botulism in anaerobic environments. Acidity is why you can store that garlic in vinegar with no issues.\n\n# ON TAKING RISKS\n\n>*I've long believed that good food, good eating, is all about risk. Whether we're talking about unpasteurized Stilton, raw oysters, or working for organized crime 'associates\u2019, food, for me, has always been an adventure.*  \n>  \n>\u2014 Anthony Bourdain\n\nI still eat raw fish when I can buy it fresh. I still use raw egg whites in my cocktails. And I still like my pork chops cooked a lot closer to medium rare than medium.\n\nUltimately, you can\u2019t eliminate the risk of foodborne illness. But by equipping yourself with an understanding of the possible dangers, you can make more informed trade-offs between danger and deliciousness. And when you\u2019re serving others that might have different risk tolerances, you can adjust your approach as needed. Best of luck, and enjoy the adventure.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/m4xum8/how_to_not_kill_people_with_your_food/", "created_utc": 1615737858.0, "score": 6947, "author": "presdaddy", "num_comments": 469, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/m4xum8/how_to_not_kill_people_with_your_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Egyptian falafel are made with fava beans, which makes tastier, crispier and lighter falafel than chickpeas. They've won many awards and are pretty easy to make at home. Full recipe inside and I'll also teach you about stuffed falafel", "selftext": "It's safe to say falafel has taken the world by storm. Other than Hummus, it's the most widely known Middle Eastern food and for good reason. The bite sized fritters are extremely crisp and if done right, they're packed full of flavour. Apart from being vegan, they're also incredibly cheap to cook and so they make for a great filling meal on a budget. It's my opinion that falafel made with fava beans are better than the more common chickpea falafel ([Photo proof here](https://imgur.com/a/NzlQGMs)), and it may just be the original ingredient historically used in falafel. It's a matter of contention that can cause rifts between Egyptians (Fava falafel) and Levantines (Chickpea falafel), however [competitions](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/04/the-falafel-battle-which-country-cooks-it-best) and [critics](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190715-does-egypt-have-the-best-falafel-in-the-world) have confirmed this [over](https://pulses.org/updates/488-winner-of-london-falafel-festival-competition-recounts-event) and [over](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/en-espanol/sdhoy-egypt-wins-inaugural-london-falafel-festival-2016may04-story.html) again. The resulting falafel have a [crispier exterior, fluffier interior, lighter texture](https://imgur.com/Sp2caGH) and are just way more flavourful. To top it all off, they're [a lot easier to cook](https://imgur.com/fnAhQnb) and if you use this recipe, you can say good bye to falafel that fall apart when frying. \n\n#### As always I have a [full video recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY) where I go into all the details and show off the special techniques that I mention below. If you enjoy the post I'm sure you'll also like the video.\n\nIf you just want the recipe ctrl+f for \"Ingredients\"\n\n## What is Falafel and how is Taameya different\n\nIf you've not had falafel before; they're deep fried fritters that are [usually made from ground chickpeas](https://zaatarandzaytoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-21-at-17.46.46.jpg). This Middle Eastern food is as synonymous with the region, as Pasta is to Italy, and it's become one of the most popular vegan foods in the world. Traditional falafel is made with lots of fresh herbs and onions, which give them a bright green colour as well as a fresh and herby flavour. For the most part falafel is considered a breakfast or lunch food, and most people in Egypt (and the Levant region) will eat [falafel sandwiches](https://imgur.com/qgFhLfT) at least 2-3 times a week. The popularity comes down to a few factors, the flavour, it's price and how filling it is. Firstly it's extremely cheap to make falafel, and while you might get charged $7-10 for a [good falafel sandwich](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sFqzHGi3qqWyysQx6EYDZSy1KY=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13689423/Zooba_4.jpg) (about \u00a38 in the UK), they usually cost about 10c or less in the Middle East and you can probably make 40 pieces for less than $5 ($1 in the Middle East). Secondly, they are packed full of flavour, all the herbs and onions give them a fresh taste, while the addition of coriander, garlic and cumin give them the perfect amount of spice. Finally they're a nutritionally dense food which help keep you full, you've got a decent amount of fibre and protein, but also quite a lot of macro-nutrients and let's not forget the fat from their frying.\n\nEgyptian falafel (or as it's called in most of Egypt, Taameya) is a bit different from the falafel you're probably used to, as nearly all falafel sold in Europe and the US is Levantine falafel. The main difference is that it is made with [split fava (broad) beans](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) rather than chickpeas (garbanzo beans) and this has a significant impact on the texture of the falafel. If you've ever tried to cook chickpea falafel yourself, you'll know that when the chickpeas are ground they develop a [super fine chopped texture](https://www.seriouseats.com/images/2016/03/20160323-falafel-recipe-01-composite.jpg) that almost resembles bulgur. It can sometimes have a hard time binding together which can lead to them falling apart when you fry them. To get around that, many people add binders such as flour or eggs to their falafel, but that has the negative effect of making the centre of the falafel dense and stodgy. Fava beans on the other hand [turn into a paste](https://imgur.com/bvtCkf1) when you process them. Rather than having very finely minced chickpeas as the base of your falafel, the fava beans are already bound together and so they are able to hold their shape naturally. The fava bean batter also ends up wetter than the chickpea batter, this causes more steam to evaporate when frying which gives it an airy texture. The traditional way of making Taameya involves grinding the beans in a mechanical pestle and mortar, [which also has the added effect of whipping air into the batter](https://youtu.be/c_AU4Sc_fMQ?t=185). To emulate this you can use the beater attachment on a stand mixer, which will [incorporate even more air](https://imgur.com/N7mx3En) and you'll end up with falafel that are light enough to float when frying (they'll still be great if you dont do this).\n\nApart from the texture, Egyptian falafel also tastes different from Levantine falafel. In Egyptian falafel, Kurrat (a species of wild leek native to Egypt) is used in place of the onion, and it imparts a leek like flavour with sweet and mellowed onion notes. To replicate that flavour, a combination of Spring Onions and leeks work really well. In terms of herbs, the batter also needs fresh coriander, parsley and garlic, then it's seasoned with Ground Coriander, Cumin, and Chilli powder. As opposed to the [ball shape](https://imgur.com/tGgWzEu) of most falafel, Taameya is usually shaped into a [hockey puck](https://imgur.com/op2g5nS), and the exterior is coated with sesame and coriander seeds. This shape means you get more crispy surface area but it also allows the insides to cook quicker (they also fit better in sandwiches). Of course this can still be made into the classic ball shape, and the great thing about this batter is that you can just [use an ice cream scoop](https://imgur.com/fnAhQnb) without manually shaping to get your falafel in the hot oil.\n\nThere's a few other types of falafel that we make in Egypt, but the one I think you should know about is stuffed Taameya. These are filled with a spicy onion filling that is made by sweating onions with Harissa and Tomato paste. When placed in a sandwich, they have that perfect spicy balance that you'd usually try to get by adding hot sauce. We also make a Taameya omelette that we call Egga, this is just Taameya batter mixed with a few eggs before frying. It has a strong herby flavour in comparison to a regular omelette and it's a good way to use up any leftover batter. The best way to serve Taameya is in a sandwich. These are typically made with a flatbread similar to pitta, and are accompanied by a tahini sauce and a simple salad. We usually eat this with salty turnip, carrot and cauliflower pickles called [Torshy](https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000628636335-wiqf3p-t500x500.jpg) (Torsu in Turkish), or some pickled fried aubergine. \n\n## Cultural Context\n\nThere are a lot of theories about where and how Falafel or Taameya originated, and it's a very charged topic with most countries in the Middle East claiming to have invented it. The truth is no one really knows where falafel originated but it's very likely that it has an [Egyptian Origin](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/falafel). Many Egyptians will say that falafel is a Pharaonic food and that the consumption of fava beans was common place in ancient Egypt, however the practice of deep frying falafel would have been difficult without refined oils. Another favourite theory is that it was first eaten by Coptic Christians as a meat alternative during their fasts, but there isn't any evidence to back this up. The most likely theory is that was invented during the British Occupation of Egypt as the first recipe for falafel appears around this time. One historian claims it may have been inspired by the Indian dish parippu vada, which is like a falafel but made with green peas. This theory holds a lot of weight with me, particularly because the British occupation of Egypt also lead to the creation of [Koshari](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ik05j7/koshari_is_an_egyptian_dish_that_exemplifies_the/), which itself was an Egyptianization of the Indian dish Kichidi. \n\nThe theory goes that as falafel spread outwards from Egypt, the ingredients that were used also changed based on their availability. The chickpea replaced fava beans in the levant and the spices changed with it. If you're wondering why you've never heard of fava bean falafel, it's probably because nearly all Middle Eastern restaurants in the US and Europe feature a Lebanese menu.\n\n## Flavour Profile\nThis recipe will make Taameya with a herby and fresh flavour that is way beyond anything you could buy premade. The Coriander, parsley, spring onions and leeks all merge together to give the falafel a bright and strong herb flavour with notes of sweetness from the leeks. The cumin and Ground coriander give it that background heat flavour (not spicy) and if your Ground Coriander is very fresh, it will also give a tart citrussy background flavour. You'll also notice this in the topping which coats the exterior of the Taameya, and combined the sesame seeds it adds some crunch.\n\nIn terms of texture, the Taameya is very light and fluffy. The interior will be airy and a bright green colour, whereas the exterior will be crisp and dry making for a satisfying bite. Adding them into a sandwich with some Tahini sauce, and a tomato and cucumber salad turns them into a sensational meal. I'd recommend using fresh homemade pitta bread for the sandwich and making a tahini sauce with lemon and garlic.\n\n## Ingredients:\n\n### Taameya Batter\n* 400g Split Skinless Fava beans. You need the [bag on the left](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) not on the right. The left has the skins removed and if you make this with the skins the recipe WILL NOT work\n* 100g Spring Onions  \n* 100g Leeks  \n* 50g Coriander leaves\n* 50g Parsley  \n* 4 Cloves of garlic  \n* 2 Tsp Ground Coriander  \n* 1 Tsp Cumin  \n* 1 Tsp Cayenne  \n* 2.5 Tsp salt  \n* 1l (1 quart) vegetable oil for frying  \n\n### Harissa Filling\n* 1 Medium Brown Onion  \n* 1.5 Tbsp of Harissa  \n* 1.5 Tbsp of Red Pepper or tomato paste  \n* 1 Tbsp of Olive Oil  \n* 1/4 Tsp Cumin  \n* 1/4 Tsp salt  \n* 1/4 Tsp Pepper  \n* 1/4 Tsp Ground Coriander  \n\n### Topping\n* 1/4 Cup Coriander seeds  \n* 1/4 Cup Sesame  \n\n## Directions: \n\nI highly recommend watching the video for more precise directions and because there are some techniques for shaping that can only be explained visually https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY\n\n### To make the falafel batter:\n1. Wash your split fava beans thoroughly with cold water, then place in a bowl and cover with a large amount of water. Allow them to soak for a minimum of 8 hours until doubled in size  \n2. Once doubled in size, drain the fava beans and set them aside  \n3. Wash your leeks, spring onions, coriander and parsley, then roughly chop them up to a managable size for your food processor. Use the white part of the leek and while of the spring onion\n4. Add all of the greens to your food processor and add the beans on top (The weight of the beans will help force the herbs into the blade, and it's a lot quicker than putting the herbs on top of the beans)  \n5. Process everything until a finely minced paste forms (about 2-3 minutes), making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Once it looks homogenous and fairly well minced add the salt and spices  \n6. Continue processing together thoroughly until well combined then set aside  \n\n### To make the stuffing:\n1. Chop your onion into a small dice, then place in a pot over medium heat with 1 tbsp of olive oil  \n2. Saute for about 5 minutes until the onions start to soften then add the Harissa, Red Pepper paste and the seasonings  \n3. Add a small amount of water to form a sauce, then allow it to cook down and thicken (about 15 minutes of cooking time)  \n4. Repeat adding water and allowing the topping to reduce until the onions and sauce are cooked through  \n\n### To make the falafel topping:\n1. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the Coriander seeds till you can smell their aroma. You should split most of the seeds in half but you don't want to grind them into a powder  \n2. Combine the coriander seeds with the sesame and it's ready to use  \n\n### To whip up the batter:\n\nAdd about a quarter of the batter to a stand mixer, and whisk it with your paddle attachement on medium speed for about 5 minutes. When it is light and fluffy it's ready to be used. Use the whipped mixture immediately as it will deflate quickly. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer, or the whisk attachment on your food processor. A blender may also work and manually whisking it might help. If you can't do this step at all, you can add a 1/4 tsp of baking soda to each cup and a half of batter and whisk it in. That will help fluff it up slightly  \n\n### To shape the falafel:\n1. Wet the palm of your hand or a piece of parchment paper, very lightly  \n2. Place about 2-3 Tbsp (or 1 ice cream scoop) of Batter on the paper/your hand then lightly flatten it using your other hand. Apply very little pressure as you don't want this to end up very thin  \n3. Wet your second hand and press it into the topping, then lightly press the topping to the batter so it sticks  \n4. Flip your Ta'ameya onto your second hand or another piece of parchment paper then apply the topping to this side as well  \n5. Fry the ta'ameya within 5 minutes of shaping otherwise it will deflate\nNOTE: If you are doing this on your hand directly, you'll have to put them in the oil straight away. This can be a bit dangerous as you'll need to get your hand very close to the oil, but if you're comfortable, this technique works amazing. See [the video](youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY) for the visual technique.\n\n### To shape the falafel the easy way:\n1. Using an ice cream scoop, fill the scoop with batter, then scrape off any excess  \n2. You can dip the top of the scoop into the seeds or you can add them to the scoop before filling it  \n3. Release the falafel directly into the oil  \n\n### To stuff the falafel:\n1. Repeat steps 1-2 from \"To shape the falafel\", using about 2/3rds of the batter amount  \n2. Place about a teaspoon of filling in the centre of the batter and flatten it out  \n3. Add the remaining 1/3rd of batter on top then join the two sides together  \n4. Add the topping to both sides or leave plain to differentiate it  \n\n### To fry the falafel:\n1. Heat your oil to 160c or 320f, then add your falafel in  (I'd recommend using an oil thermometer here, too hot will undercook the falafel and too low will allow it to absorb more oil)  \n2. Once in, baste the top immediately with hot oil so it solidifies. I'd recommend using a spoon to splash them with oil and this prevents the falafel from deforming or falling apart  \n3. Fry the falafel for 2-3 minutes on the first side  \n4. Flip over once browned underneath then fry for another 2-3 minutes  \n5. When that time is up, fry it for 2 more minutes on each side  \n6. Remove from the oil with a spider and drain, before placing it on a paper towel lined tray to dry for a few minutes  \n7. Serve within 5 minutes and enjoy  \n\n### To make a fantastic falafel sandwich\n1. Make homemade pita, store bought is crap and this falafel deserves better  \n2. Make a simple Egyptian salad, with roughly chopped cucumber, tomato, spring onion, parsley and season with lemon juice, olive oil and white vinegar  \n3. Make a tahini sauce according to this [recipe](https://youtu.be/Y7r9HAcR2RQ)  \n4. Split open your pitta bread, and spread in a layer of the tahini sauce  \n5. Add a couple tablespoons of salad to the bread, and some optional salty pickles  \n6.

Too much liquid. It's especially bad for me because my husband really prefers thick, hearty soups to thin ones. So I added some of my secret ingredient. Instant mashed potatoes (which I keep around for really lazy days when I just cannot be bothered and emergencies when I am making something that requires potatoes and all my potatoes have sprouted or rotted).\n\nIdk man, maybe this isn't as bad of a sin as I thought?

I guess there are flavored ones (like with herbs and butter flavor and you just add water????) But i've never used or eaten those. I just use plain ol' potato flakes (the ones you gotta add the milk, butter, and salt to yourself).\n\nEdit the second: definitely also consider the flavor and texture of the soup before adding potato flakes.

{"title": "Lentil soup is so popular in the Middle East, that it's eaten in every single country and nearly every house. It's cheap, delicious and simple to make, and I think it may become your favorite soup this winter, recipe inside", "selftext": "Lentil soup is a dish you can find in most countries around the world, you can get it from Scotland, to China, to Srilanka, but few places give it such high regard as the Middle East. In the Middle East it's extremely popular, and you can get it at restaurants and even takeaways all over the region. The history of the lentil in the region goes back quite literally to the dawn of civilization and I like to think we have mastered the making of lentil soups. To this day it's eaten regularly in households all over the region and I think you should cook it this winter. If you grew up disliking lentils like myself, you may find yourself converted by this recipe.\n\nAs usual I have a [full video recipe](https://youtu.be/oi-dcSkR-FQ) which you can follow and I've linked to all my past r/cooking posts in the comments.\n\n\n## What is Middle Eastern Lentil soup\n[Middle Eastern lentil soup](https://imgur.com/a/bykh8Qj) is made by boiling split red (or yellow) lentils until softened and tender. They're usually cooked with a combination of different vegetables or meat and are spiced accordingly to the taste of each country. The dish is widely eaten throughout the Middle East and is commonly served during the Month of Ramadan, when many people like to break their fast with a bowl of warm soup, it has the benefit of being simple to cook and very filling which make it a perfect Ramadan meal. Lentil soup is also a favorite amongst Middle Eastern Christian communities many of whom fast and adhere to a vegan diet for many days throughout the year including the Coptic Christians of Egypt who fast a whopping 180-210 days. \n\nThe dish itself heavily varies from country to country and even house to house, and is usually made with whatever vegetables are on hand. I find that the use of onions, carrots and tomatoes give it a delicious and well rounded flavor, though it's possible to also add celery or courgettes (zuchinni). In this recipe the soup is blended once cooked into a smooth and creamy texture, with the lentils helping to emulsify the soup until it resembles the texture of a cream based soup. In some countries the soup is not blended, and it can have eggs, beans or even pieces of meat added to it. The moroccan dish [Harrira](https://mayihavethatrecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vegetarian-harira-soup-2.jpg), takes the soup further, with the addition of chickpeas, meat, celery and spring onions as well as more spices that give it a beautiful brick red color and smokier flavor. Most Lentil soups have fried vermicelli added to them which gives a slight texture contrast just like in chicken noodle soup. In the levant it's also common to add fried bread croutons (like those used in a fattoush salad) to the soup to give it a nice layer of crunch. \n\nI'd recommend first making this recipe with the same ingredients and spices, then put your own twist on it. I think the addition of chipotle peppers and adobo would give it an amazing smokey flavor, or the addition of some fresh herbs and lemon would give it a nice sourness.  \n\n## History\nLentils have been eaten in the Middle East for millenia and are thought to be one of the first foods cultivated by humans, indeed they're considered the oldest domesticated pulse crop. Architectural digs have found evidence of lentil consumption along the Euphrates river going back to 8000BC and they've been mentioned in the holy books of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Ancient Egyptians even left offerings of lentils in tombs to feed the mumified on their journey to the afterlife. The first mention of lentil stew as a dish exists in the book of Genesis 25:34 \"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way.\". Given their historical significance and popularity, it's no surprise that they continued to be popular into the modern day. \n\nIn \"Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens\" a 10th century cookbook from Baghdad, a chapter called \"Making Dishes of Yellow Lentils\" describes a recipe that closely resembles this one, it says:\n\"Wash and pick over hulled lentil and cook it until it falls apart and becomes mushy. Cook with it round onion, olive oil, and salt. Add some vinegar. You have the option of adding to it sugar and saffron. Alternatively, if you do not like to use saffron or onion, put bruised garlic cloves and a dusting of cumin in the pot after adding the vinegar\". \n\nAfter the introduction of the Tomato to the Middle East, it has kind of become a necessary ingredient in lentil soup which really elevates the flavor of the dish. The introduction of blenders and food processors also eased the process of milling the cooked lentils into a smooth soup, which prior to that was mashed by hand.\n\n## Flavor Profile\n\nThe dish is definitely a wintery tasting dish and despite not containing the usual winter spices, the earthiness of the lentils really make it feel so. The main flavor here comes from the lentils, which give the soup an earthy and nutty flavor. The red lentils in particular don't overpower the flavors of the other components and like a mushroom I find they empower the other flavors in the dish. The garlic is also quite noticeable and it gives a nice pleasant garlicky flavour to the soup. Using both crushed and fried garlic gives you a strong depth of flavor. You also get a little bit of heat from both the cumin and chili powder which takes on a background flavor in the soup, and are tolerable even to someone who doesn't like spice.\n\nOne of the main flavors here actually comes from the addition of vinegar which elevates the flavors of the whole dish, it adds just the right amount of tang and sourness to brighten the dish and rebalance the earthiness of the lentils and vegetables. The vegetables are blended into the lentils and although you can't distinctly taste each of them, they contribute sweetness and a fresh flavor to the soup, particularly the carrots add a bright flavor.  \n\n## Ingredients\n\nMakes 4-6 large servings\n\n* 1.25L (1.25 qt) Vegetable stock, you can also use chicken, meat or even water. If you are using stock cubes rather than fresh stock, then please use high quality ones.\n* 250g (1/2 lb) Split Red Lentils\n* 150g (5 1/4 oz) Carrots (about 1 large or 2 medium)\n* 1 Brown Onion\n* 1 Tomato \n* 4-6 Garlic Cloves\n* 1/2 Cup Short Wheat Vermicelli\n* 3 Tbsp White Vinegar\n* 1 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 1 1/2 Tsp Salt \n* 1 1/2 Tsp Ground Cumin\n* 1/2 Tsp Ground Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Tsp Chili powder (cayenne or whatever you have on hand)\n\n## Directions \n\n1. Peel and slice your carrots into large chunks about 1 cm or 1/2 an inch thick\n2. Peel your onion, remove the root and top and slice into quarters\n3. Wash your tomato and slice into quarters, we'll remove the skin later\n3. Peel your garlic cloves, mince 2 of them and set aside, the rest should be lightly crushed\n4. Add your chopped vegetables, the lentils and garlic (the crushed ones not minced) to a large stock pot\n5. Add your stock or water to the pot as well as 1 teaspoon of cumin, turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil\n6. When the pot boils, retrieve the tomato quarters and remove their skin, then add them back to the pot\n7. Turn the heat down to low and allow the soup to simmer for 45 minutes. When done simmering, the carrots should be cooked through and the lentils should be swollen and mushy\n8. Using an immersion (stick) blender, blend the soup and all the vegetables pieces into a uniformly smooth mixture. Once blended it will have a creamy texture that resembles wall paint, remove the soup from the heat and set aside (check the notes for regular blender warning)\n9. In a small pot add 1/2 a tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat and add the 2 minced garlic cloves to it\n10. Fry for about 30 seconds then add the remaining cumin\n11. Fry for another 15 seconds then add the vinegar\n12. Mix and fry for 15 more seconds and add pour the mixture into the lentil soup\n13. Add salt, pepper and Chili powder (optional) then mix the soup well. Taste your soup and check for seasoning, you may need to add another 1/2 tsp of salt if your stock is low in sodium, or add more Chili powder if you'd like it spicier\n14. In a pot add the remaining olive oil and the vermicelli and fry on medium high heat until it turns a golden color. Stir constantly as it can burn easily\n15. Add the fried vermicelli to the soup as well as 1 cup of water to thin the soup out. Bring the pot to a boil once more and allow the vermicelli to cook for 10 minutes\n16. When the time is up, your soup is ready. The vermicelli will have absorbed some water from the soup, so add more water to thin it out until it's thinner than the paint like texture from before. It should be able to coat the back of a spoon without running, similar to the consistency of cooking cream.\n17. Garnish with coriander, thin slices of Chili and nigella seeds\n\n## Notes and tips\n\n* You must use split red lentils for this, brown or green ones have a lot stronger taste and I think the dish won't taste right with them\n* You can serve this over rice and it will be a close approximation to Yellow Lentil Koshari or Kichidi\n* If you have a spice grinder, then toast whole cumin seeds and use them instead for an even more powerful flavor\n* A standard blender can be used in place of an immersion blender, however you need to be sure to either remove the steam vent from the lid, or leave the lid slightly ajar, as it can explode when you blend hot soups\n* The method for making the fried bread croutons is in [my fattoush post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hjx5o7/every_week_i_cook_a_middle_eastern_recipe_this/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/j20f3z/lentil_soup_is_so_popular_in_the_middle_east_that/", "created_utc": 1601390213.0, "score": 6265, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 450, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/j20f3z/lentil_soup_is_so_popular_in_the_middle_east_that/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "This is a help post, from a professional chef to you, with a lot of tips on how to get the most bang for your buck when you cook.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing lots of posts asking how to best shop and cook when the cash isn\u2019t there. As someone who\u2019s spent nearly the entirety of his professional career learning tips and tricks from some of the best chefs out there on how to keep a restaurant afloat when profit margins are so thin you have to choose between keeping half the kitchen\u2019s lights on and buying dishwashing detergent, I think I know a thing or two about cooking as affordably as possible. I\u2019m going to collate this post into a list separated into types of foods (legumes, grains, vegetables, and proteins), with tips on how to buy them and how to prepare them. I use all these tricks myself in my professional life and day-to-day. I hope this can help, and to all my fellow poor cooks out there: hang in there. The world\u2019s a mess; we only have each-other to rely on. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I\u2019ll try to respond as often as I can. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-LEGUMES\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Buy these dried as often as possible. Keep a stock of beans, lentils, and dried chickpeas around if you can. They\u2019re cheap, almost always available, and virtually imperishable. As such, assuming you don\u2019t throw them out and keep them properly stored, buying these is a 100% return on your investment. \n\n-Legumes are one of the most versatile options in your kitchen. As long as you soak them and put them in the fridge before you go to bed they\u2019ll be available the next day to cook quickly. These are the best thing to have if you\u2019re looking to stretch a meal because of their nutrient density and the fact that they\u2019re just damn delicious on their own. \n\n-Look into middle-eastern and African cuisine for creative ways to use these ingredients. Some really common examples are lentil curry, hummus, falafels, and putting chickpeas in a shakshuka. This isn\u2019t a recipe post, so look up how to make them yourself - some grandma has a better (and probably even cheaper) recipe than I do.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-GRAINS AND CEREALS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Like legumes, these are very versatile. However, I find most people know very little about them outside of wheat and maybe oats. I highly recommend learning what the most commonly eaten grans and cereals in your locality are, and then finding the affordable ones. There will be at least one. I guarantee it. \n\n-FLOUR is an essential staple, unless you\u2019re celiac or gluten free - a topic on which I won\u2019t speak because I\u2019m confident anyone who has to deal with those issues knows more than I do. I recommend grabbing all-purpose flour due to its gluten content being a middle ground between low-gluten pastry flour and high-gluten bread flour. You can still use it to make bread, and it has a myriad other uses as a binder or thickener for sauces. \n\n-RICE is amazing, as most know already, but seriously - it\u2019s one of the most important crops in the world. It\u2019s kept civilizations alive on its back for all of recorded history, and it\u2019ll keep you alive, too. There is no better \u201cfill me up\u201d food I can think of.  Wait for those huge sacks of rice to go on sale (it happens pretty frequently), then buy 2. They last forever. Ideally grab long-grain rice if you\u2019re just looking for a side-dish or fried rice base, but in a pinch short grain\u2019ll do; it\u2019s just less forgiving and the starches don\u2019t retrograde as fully so when you cool it it doesn\u2019t keep as nicely. \n\n-KEEP IN MIND that rice is pure carbs. It\u2019s a good base, but you need other stuff to go with it or else you\u2019ll be deficient in nutrients and feel awful all the time. Trust me from experience - college me went through a raw-egg-on-rice phase, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. \n\n-BARLEY, also, is amazing, but for other reasons. It\u2019s high in protein and iron, and can help dramatically improve your nutrient intake for very little cost. In soups, roasted in tea (thanks Korea), and used in tandem with rice, it can go a very, very long way in making your diet a more sustainable one in times of austerity and plenty, alike.\n\n-AVOID \u201cSUPERFOODS\u201d. Not because they\u2019re bad for you - just because of their jacked prices. Not to mention oftentimes the industries surrounding them are ethical nightmares. Don\u2019t get me started on avocado cartels and the impact of quinoa farming on low-income african communities. In reality, most grains and cereals have a lot of nutrients and minerals, and they\u2019re often overlooked. Learn the nutrition facts, and make decisions accordingly. Google and online databases are your friends, here. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-ONIONS: buy them fresh and store them in dry, enclosed spaces, and buy tomatoes canned and without salt added. Use onions in almost everything, they\u2019re delicious, cheap, and nutritious. \n\n-TOMATOES: Good fresh and better canned. Use fresh tomatoes raw for whatever you want and use canned tomatoes for sauces. Buy canned tomatoes with as little added salt and sugar as possible. \n\n- POTATOES: Treat these as a starch option similar to grains or cereals. Buy them unprocessed, in a sack.  Store them in dry, enclosed spaces. \n\n-BASICALLY EVERY FRUIT: go for it, these things are nutrient bombs and they\u2019re delicious. Buy them seasonally for the best value and if you have a day to do so, preserve them if you ever see a huge sale. I\u2019m still enjoying lacto-fermented blueberries from last year\u2019s insane blueberry harvest where I could buy a pint for a dollar.\n\n-FOR SHOPPING: Generally when you buy produce you should go, in order, to the discount rack, then the sales, and then everything else. Someone out there has a recipe for literally everything, and some of them are even good. A pepper with a blemish or tiny spot of mold is still fine, assuming you cut away the blemish or tiny spot of mold. \n\n-I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH; FIND THE UNDER-APPRECIATED AND OVER-SUPPLIED PRODUCE. There\u2019s always a bin of some forgotten veggie no-one eats for some reason. In the west, at least, it seems to often be rutabagas/turnips. I\u2019ve also seen apples in the fall, corn, and cabbages fall into this category. This is because of a good harvest, or because of a lack of consumer interest - any time this happens, capitalize on it. Everything is delicious if you cook it properly. Buy seasonally, and learn how to use the things you buy. You\u2019ll eat like a king and pay like a pauper.\n\n-CANNED STUFF - I generally have a personal aversion to all canned veggies and fruits except tomatoes, but that\u2019s just my privilege speaking. If you want to buy them or if fresh produce is hard to come by, avoid getting anything with added salt or sugar. Cross-reference the nutrient info on the can with info from a fresh counterpart to avoid buying filler garbage, and try to find somewhere to live with better food accessibility. Alternatively, save up and make a killing by opening a fruit and vegetable market to remove the need to read this very ling post any further. (This is a joke and I recognize the struggle of those in impoverished communities with awful food accessibility.)\n\n-FROZEN STUFF - frozen fruit and veg is great,\nmostly. Maybe dodge the chopped carrots and corn a lot of us ate growing up or find in bad takeout Chinese food, but hey - grab that bag of frozen berries or peas and throw \u2018em in anything that warrants it. Technology for frozen produce has improved dramatically in the last few decades, and we should capitalize on that.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014-PROTEINS\u2014\u2014-\n\n-IF YOU EAT MEAT, buy the least processed cuts you can. Whole chickens, meat on the bone, and ground meats are your best friends. Go to butcher shops, if you can. Freezing meat is fine, but try to avoid buying pre-made frozen protein options. Get raw product and do the work yourself to save a LOT of cash and get better food out of it.\n\n-MEAT IS A LUXURY, NOT AN ESSENTIAL. I say this because in modern western culture eating meat everyday is seen as normal. This is an oddity when we examine all of human history, and this notion should be abandoned if we\u2019re trying to live more affordably. Meat is grossly overrepresented in most diets, and you should always ask if you could cut your portion of meat down in exchange for more vegetables and grains.\n\n-LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN YOUR PROTEINS. A chicken isn\u2019t just 8 portions of meat - it\u2019s also bones and carcass for a stock or soup, fat to be rendered out and used as a cooking oil (thanks, jewish folks!), and skin to be cooked down into delicious little chips. This same list can be used for\npork, beef, and any other mammal you eat. \n\n-FISH IS IFFY. Like, as an industry. Not many people know their fish, and fish processing companies know that and capitalize on it. I always tell people who like fish to buy fresh and whole, and to learn how to pick good fish. Buying cheap processed fish products is akin to asking to be ripped off, to harm the environment, and to accumulate toxins in your body, all at the same time. To not get completely F-ed over by what is maybe the worst food industry in the world you need to know your fish, know the company you\u2019re buying from, and know who\u2019s doing the fishing. Good luck, and please try not to contribute to the death of our water ecosystems. (A good trick is that if you can afford fish when you\u2019re poor and you don\u2019t live beside a large body of water, you almost certainly DON\u2019T WANT IT.)\n\n-IF YOU DO BUY FISH OR SEAFOOD, all the rules for proteins apply. Fish bones and crustacean shells for stock, fat deposits on the occasional salmonid for whatever you want, and fish skin, if it\u2019s your cup of tea, for a lovely snack. Hell, fish organs and salt make up the base for a fermented fish sauce, if you really want to go the extra mile. Rome survived off of fish sauce and bread for longer than our society has been around. The one big difference between fish and meat is that frozen fish tends to suck relative to fresh in a much bigger way - both in terms of quality and retained nutrients. Put frozen fish in soups or curries, to avoid nutrient drain from the water that inevitably will leak out of your fish.\n\nFOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS: I\u2019m not vegetarian or vegan, and while I think there\u2019s great habits to be learned from the lifestyle after getting boatloads of comments I just don\u2019t feel I should even touch the subject. Just do you, and do your research. Best of luck.\n\n\u2014\u2014-EVERYTHING ELSE\u2014\u2014-\n\n-STAY AWAY FROM THE INSTANT RAMEN. I know it\u2019s cheap. I KNOW you like how easy it is. I don\u2019t give one flying fuck. It\u2019s awful for you, it isn\u2019t cheaper than a bowl of rice with soy sauce, a fried egg, and some frozen peas, and it\u2019ll kill you slowly. Just don\u2019t, and ignore anyone\u2019s advice about how it got them through college. Hell, if anyone\u2019s advice involves doing what they did in college, take it with a grain of salt. There\u2019s good advice sometimes, and a LOT of bad.\n\n-AVOID THE CENTRE AISLES IN GROCERY STORES. Chips, sugar cereals, premade salad dressings, sweet juice/pop, and processed foods like KD or tv dinners are not the way to go if you\u2019re looking to get the most out of your dollar at the grocery store. They\u2019re bad for you, they\u2019re expensive relative to the cost of production, and they put a burden on your body that you\u2019ll pay for down the line. Exceptions to this are staple sauces like a good soy sauce and fish sauce, grains and legumes, and canned veggies. \n\n-CHEESE IS A LUXURY, SO TREAT IT LIKE ONE. If you\u2019re gonna buy it I recommend buying less of it less often, and buying the good stuff when you do. Kraft block cheese only costs as little as it does because it\u2019s the by-product of the real money-maker: whey protein production. If you\u2019re gonna buy cheese, please support a real cheesemaker. The cheese lover in you will be happier for it. \n\n-ALCOHOL IS ALSO A LUXURY. If you want a drink, I recommend doing it less often and drinking the good stuff. If you like the cheap stuff that\u2019s fine, \u201cgood stuff\u201d is all relative anyway. Just drink less and focus on quality over quantity, whatever your preferences are. \n\n-MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE, AND BUY A THERMOS. I know Starbucks is delicious. Guess what? You can find a recipe for every drink they make online, and then make it better. Some restaurants literally survive because they can sell coffee at a nearly 2000% markup. Truck stop diners and high-end coffee shops do this. I recommend making cold brew the night before, since you literally just have to strain it in the morning rather than brewing a pot.\n\n-FINALLY, LEARN TO COOK. All of this information is fundamentally more useful if you know how to cook. Not knowing how to cook is a luxury afforded to those with the means to afford living in ignorance of this most basic human skill. You are living outside your means if you live in a well-off country, don\u2019t make a least $60k a year, and can\u2019t cook. \n\n\nBest of luck to you all.

I cracked the egg in the bowl, added some salt and pepper, and scrambled it in the bowl. \n\n\u201cOh, you *season* the egg??\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll yeah, of course! It\u2019s gotta have some flavor\u201d I replied.\n\nThen I heated a small pan, put some butter in and he goes \u201coh wow, you put *butter* in the eggs?\u201d\n\nAnd I said \u201cI like to put butter cause it usually makes the eggs taste better and prevents it from sticking\u201d\n\nHe was amazed at how good the eggs actually smelled, looked, and tasted!

Even fresh cooked hot rice works as long as the excess surface moisture escapes as steam.\n\n[https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/the-food-lab-how-to-make-best-fried-rice-chinese-thai-wok-technique-right-type-of-rice.html](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/the-food-lab-how-to-make-best-fried-rice-chinese-thai-wok-technique-right-type-of-rice.html)\n\nNow to get the the rant... Why does no one ever point out that YOU NEED MSG FOR THAT CHINESE TAKEOUT TASTE. Like if anyone asks anything about fried rice in this subreddit, there will be an army of people coming in their with \"use day old rice\" propaganda, like okay we get it! People just act like that technqiue is the second coming of Jesus or something. Yet no one mentions MSG?\n\nI have worked on my fried rice for a while and got it to the point its way better than take out, and the secret?\n\nIt's a combination of many factors (dry rice included). Good heat control (high heat all the way for fried rice), cooking in batches, Good rice ( I use jasmine, I think its the ideal level of stickiness).\n\nBut what people tend to miss out on is that, you need MSG, without MSG your fried rice will always taste like it lacks some compared to the restaurant's no matter what. Chineese takeout places use chicken bouillion powder and that really add's that takeout taste, I have tried it for myself. I can't list the number of times people asked for my secret when cooking and the only answer I had was that I use a heavy hand with the MSG. It's role in chinese food cannot be underestimated.\n\nAlso using butter or bacon fat (use both for godlike taste) in fried rice can elevate it beyond what you are used to having in the restaurant's.\n\nedit1- To all you precious people saying you don't use MSG, but your fried rice is still AMAZING and the BEST IN THE WORLD, I suggest you try using MSG so your fried rice can be EXTRA SUPER DUPER DELUXE AMAZING.

{"title": "What the coronavirus forcing me in lockdown's taught me about cooking; plus, how to make Mantou (\u9992\u5934)", "selftext": "So there\u2019s an offchance you might recognize my username: I\u2019m the dude that\u2019s posted weekly Chinese recipes here for the last\u2026 couple years or so. Together with my fianc\u00e9 (who\u2019s from Guangdong), we live in Shunde, China \u2013 a small city a bit south of Guangzhou on the Macau side of the delta. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been inundated with news about the most recent coronavirus outbreak over on this side of the world \u2013 I certainly don\u2019t want to pile on and make you any more anxious than you need to be. That\u2019s not my goal: social media does a good enough job with that as is. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I feel like this time\u2019s given me some personal insights on food and cooking that I haven\u2019t really had the chance to internalize in the past. Maybe everything I\u2019m about to write is all obvious to you, I don\u2019t know. But I figured I\u2019d share regardless.\n\n**The situation we\u2019ve found ourselves in**\n\nSee, for the past two weeks or so, the city we live has more or less\u2026 shut down. People don\u2019t go outside unless they have to \u2013 we take our dog for walks up on the roof of our apartment complex, make quick runs to 7/11 for supplies every two days or so (because I mean\u2026 alcohol is pretty much mandatory in a time like this), and\u2026 that\u2019s pretty much it. Restaurants are for the most part all closed down. The city is essentially on the economic equivalent of life support \u2013 the only things that\u2019re open are convenience stores, grocery stores, and pharmacies. There\u2019s checkpoints and roadblocks entering and leaving the city. Hell, every time we leave or enter our apartment complex we\u2019re checked for symptoms by the doorman. The only people that dare to go outside without a medical mask are those unlucky sods that didn\u2019t get the chance to buy any before supplies ran out.\n\nNow I don\u2019t mean to paint too apocalyptic of a picture here. We live in Shunde, not Wuhan (which\u2019s tragically borne the brunt of all this). A lot of these measures are precautionary, and\u2026 you sort of get used to it all. It sucks, no doubt. But it says a lot about human psychology just how quickly a new normal can become\u2026 normal. \n\nFeeding yourself is an interesting challenge, however. Completely by happy accident, out of any of our friends or family we\u2019re probably the most prepared for this kind of situation. We do a YouTube cooking thing, after all. We test a lot of recipes. Our cabinets, fridges, freezers are *stocked* with leftovers, sauces, nuts, dried seafood and mushrooms, frozen meats, pickles, tubers, grains\u2026 shit, we could probably live for a month off our food stock alone and not starve. And while we\u2019re far from chefs, I do like to think we know a thing or two about cooking\u2026 so at least a portion of that month might actually be rather tasty.\n\nWhat I just wasn\u2019t mentally prepared for, however, was the shortage of fresh vegetables.  Veggies were pretty much the first thing to go after medical masks. If you\u2019re anything like me, the thought of that makes you feel\u2026 claustrophobic. *No fresh vegetables for potentially weeks on end.* The walls start closing in\u2026\n\nLuckily of course, we don\u2019t live in the epicenter of all this. Where we live at least, you *can* get fresh vegetables. It\u2019s just not super easy. Supermarkets get one shipment in a day and you pretty much have to order online ~30 minutes from that time before they sell out. You pretty much don\u2019t have a choice in what you get \u2013 when you\u2019re in that window you\u2019ll take what you can get. Chilis, carrots, and broccoli are usually available. Anything else is a crapshoot. \n\nBut it\u2019s fine. Buy what you can. Pickiness is luxury.\n\n**What this does to your mindset**\n\nI think everyone that\u2019s a devoted homecook is pretty experienced with cleaning out their fridge before stuff goes bad. We\u2019ve all had those *fuck it, let\u2019s feed myself* stews, sandwiches, and stir-fries. Some of them might\u2019ve actually been pretty good! To me at least, that\u2019s the ultimate test of the skill of a cook. A novice sees a sparsely populated refrigerator and thinks, \u201cdelivery\u201d. An experienced cook can look at that same refrigerator and can see\u2026 possibility.  \n\nThere\u2019s three ways that make our current situation unique to that\u2026 ever so common experience:\n\n1.\t*We have time.* Lots of it. Too much, really. The epidemic has been a mandatory extended vacation for the majority of the country.\n\n2.\t*We don\u2019t have much choice in ingredients.* While similar to the normal exercise, we have this weird overabundance of some ingredients together with a shortage of others. Way too much carrot\u2026\n\n3.\t*The supplies must last.* What\u2019s **really** the crux of the what\u2019s made this situation such a unique feeling to me. Nothing is wasted. Every square millimeter of that broccoli\u2019s used. I\u2019m careful with how much aromatics I use. Because like, while it\u2019s quite likely we\u2019d be able to get garlic in the next time we squeeze in a food order, you never know.\n\nAll of these factors *force* you to be creative \u2013 day in and day out. You approach each meal differently. You don\u2019t enter the kitchen with the mindset of \u201cwhat do I feel like eating?\u201d You enter it asking the question, \u201cwhat\u2019s the best thing I can possibly make with the resources I have?\u201d \n\nCooking with this kind of scarcity mindset\u2019s been\u2026 eye-opening. An entirely different perspective. There\u2019s a lot of rambling online about \u201ccreative constraint\u201d \u2013 how limitations force you to be creative. Much of it has the tone of pseudo-scientific self-help bullshit (and given the replication crisis in psychology, who knows if there\u2019s a solid scientific foundation for the idea), but after these couple weeks\u2026 I think it\u2019s true. I mean\u2026 some of the best art happens with limitations \u2013 poetry in meter, painting on a canvas. \n\nSome other random shit I\u2019ve internalized:\n\n* I have a newfound appreciation for cuisines from colder climates. In this kind of environment, you get a lot more inspiration from, say, Northwestern Chinese food than (central) Thai food.\n\n* Pickled vegetables seem to scratch the same itch fresh vegetables do. \n\n* On that note, modern Korean kimchi might be the greatest invention of the 19th century. The steam engine doesn\u2019t have anything on kimchi.\n\n* Flour is amazing. You can do anything with flour.\n\n* Life would fucking suck without fermented sauces. We would be eating so, so much worse without soy sauce and fish sauce. \n\nI\u2019ll go over some of the stuff we\u2019ve whipped up in the lockdown below, but first\u2026 there\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been mulling over for a while. I have zero clue if any of this\u2019ll make sense, I\u2019m kind of working through this shit myself. Hopefully my ramblings aren\u2019t *too* boring\u2026\n\n**Why I think modern cuisine kinda sucks:**\n\nThere\u2019s something that\u2019s bothered me for a while. Stay with me here.\n\nThink of almost any dish that you can name. Anywhere in the world. Chinese food, French food, whatever. There\u2019s probably 95% chance that that dish \u2013 or at least what you would *recognize* as that dish was first invented during the time period of 1750 \u2013 1950. A few examples:\n\n* Mapo Tofu, 1874.\n\n* Modern (not fermented) sushi, 1750.\n\n* Neopolitan Pizza, 1889.\n\n* Pho, mid 1880s.\n\n* Gumbo, 1802.\n\n* Modern Paella, 1840.\n\n* Beef Bourguignon, mid 1800s.\n\n* Risotto, 1809.\n\n* Eggs Benedict, 1894.\n\n* Char Siu Bao, 1924. \n\nFor any of these, you could obviously quibble about the exact dates. E.g. slaves in Louisiana were eating a gumbo-esque Okra stew that was labelled \u2018gumbo\u2019 since the early to mid 1700s, 1802 was simply the first recorded instance of the dish. You could do this exercise the list over, of course \u2013 hell, fermented *narezushi* can be traced all the way back to 2nd century AD China. \n\nBut as you stand back, a mosaic begins to emerge. First thing you notice? Much of what we consider \u2018cuisine\u2019 is\u2026 surprisingly *modern*.  Like, I know with Chinese food there\u2019s almost an assumption that most of the food has thousands of years of history or something\u2026 nope! While it\u2019s definitely cool that there\u2019s a few dishes that you can trace back to the Song dynasty or even earlier\u2026 like it is the world over, most of the innovation (on the level of individual dishes, at least) seemed to happen post 1750. Second thing you notice? Most of the innovation stops around the time of world war two. Post war? The landscape of newly invented foods seems\u2026 pretty barren.\n\nThe question of why has\u2026 knawed on me ever since I saw those puzzle pieces. Maybe it\u2019s a mirage. Maybe if you were standing in 1870 England and you fired up your Victorian steampunk Babbage-engine equivalent of Wikipedia, you\u2019d find all the dishes you loved seem to have been invented in the years of 1600-1800? Who knows. Food history is murky as all hell. After all, throughout the course of human civilization, people tend to write about Kings and Revolutionaries and Conquerors\u2026 not the cooks that fed them. But I think we at least need to entertain the notion that *maybe* there was *some* sort of special sauce that led to that Cambrian explosion of dishes in those two centuries.\n\nI\u2019m still not sure if I have an answer \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that I don\u2019t. Some possible reasons for the upsurge of recorded dishes mid 18th century:\n\n1.\tThe Columbian exchange/the entire colonial project introduced novel ingredients from around the world and touched almost every society.  Obviously this process started in the 16th century, but it was a couple centuries yet before it people started eating tomatoes in Italy and chilis in Sichuan.\n\n2.\tThe development of the restaurant. Restaurants became common in China in the Song dynasty (I believe, don\u2019t hold me to that) and in the West in the 19th century. This seems to coincide with a greater diversity in recorded dishes in both those places.\n\n3.\tThe printing press could be another possibility. The dates aren\u2019t quite as neat though, as the first printed cookbook was in 1485. But cookbooks began gaining popularity in the mid 17th century, so maybe.\n\nOr perhaps any number of those reasons. Or perhaps a combination. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m far from a historian. As to some possible culprits of the decline of cooking:\n\n1.\tThe electric refrigerator became commonplace in 1940s, potentially killing the creativity-inducing \u2018scarcity mindset\u2019\n\n2.\tWomen in the workplace became much more common post war. Obviously a very good and beneficial development from a societal perspective, but perhaps the loss of half of society devoted to the job of cooking may have harmed cuisine?\n\n3.\tMass production of full meals \u2013 in the form of TV dinners and began in earnest in the post-war period.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not sure the answer. If you pressed me before this whole coronavirus lockdown episode, I\u2019d probably have told you that modernism and mass production is to blame. Now\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nI think time has something to do with it, potentially. I can\u2019t seem to find any good data on the topic for the pre-war period, but in 1965 women in America spent \u2013 on average \u2013 two hours a day cooking. Now women spend an average of 51 minutes (men, 22 minutes\u2026 c\u2019mon guys\u2026). Despite what the \u201cQUICK AND EASY!!!!!!\u201d bloggers of the world tell you, you can prepare much better food in the time of two hours than you can in 22 minutes.\n\nMix that with a dash of scarcity induced creative limitation? The entire **society** over? That seems like a recipe for some good food.\n\n**Why modern \u2018fusion\u2019 is boring:**\n\nWhich brings us to the other great culinary mystery our time: why does fusion suck so hard?\n\nBecause I mean, if you look at cuisines around the world\u2026 the cultures at the intersection of great migrations or trade routes seem to have some pretty damn interesting food. Situated in the middle of the silk road, Uighur cuisine is an awesome mix between Northwestern Han Chinese and other central Asian foods. Sichuanese food, meanwhile, was the product of one of the most massive internal migrations of human history, when the province was repopulated by people from Hunan and Shandong after a devasting war (the Qing government kinda killed\u2026 everyone). The food in the Malacca straights, with the mix of Southeast Asian, Indian and Chinese flavors is aggressively awesome. Istanbul \u2013 at the crossroads of Occident and Orient - is one of the world\u2019s great food cities.\n\nSo why, despite all of our best efforts in the past forty years, have our culinary mashups seemed to go basically nowhere? Like, seriously. With a touch of digging, you can have an entire globe\u2019s worth of ingredients available to you. With the smallest amount of gumption, you can have authentic recipes and techniques the world over *demonstrated*to you in video form. \n\nWhen it was just out-of-touch white American chefs mindlessly smushing together high end French and Japanese food in the 80s, you could kind of get why \u201cfusion\u201d sucked: it was pretty much the dictionary definition of pretention. But now\u2026 now we have *all* these resources\u2026 now we have so much more diversity in chefs\u2026 and the best the great culinary minds of our generation can come up with is\u2026 fucking Kung Pao Pastrami? Seriously? \n\nIt circles back to the importance of limitations, I think. Limitations help break you out of *functional fixedness* - i.e. limiting yourself to using an object only in the way it\u2019s traditionally used. The most famous example of this is the \u201ccandle box problem\u201d in psychology:\n\n>Participants were shown a picture containing several products on a table: a candle, a pack of matches, and a box of tacks, all of which were next to a wall. Participants\u2019 task was to figure out how to attach the candle to the wall by using only the objects on the table, so that the candle burns properly and does not drip wax on the table or the floor.\n\n[This is the answer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Genimage.jpg), if you\u2019re curious. Now again, I don\u2019t like using psychology studies to prove a point because (a) I am not a psychologist and (b) there\u2019s a rich history of other not-psychologist-people twisting studies and taking them out of context in order to peddle BS. But with that preface out of the way, I still think the concept of functional fixedness can at least help us give some sort of framework as to why fusion \u2013 still \u2013 sucks.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at [this Wagyu Beef Bao Bun](https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/65040779_327039218192713_454442603002945579_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=hu5yy2NmBqQAX80q5o8&oh=2a4591cbb6a4d1a3c42790bdeaf76179&oe=5ED29557) from Wolfgang Puck. I\u2019m sure it tastes fine, I\u2019m not going to argue otherwise. But what I *will* argue is that that dish is goddam boring, and probably not worth the premium. \n\nWhy? The \u201cBao Bun\u201d there (god, I hate that translation) is simply conceptualized as sandwich bread. It\u2019s not interesting, it\u2019s just\u2026 a more instagrammable potato roll. So many of these trendy \u2018Bao\u2019 creations throughout the OECD are just hipsters putting Asian shit on steamed buns and the media patting them on the back for their ingenuity. But there\u2019s nothing ingenious there. It\u2019s\u2026 a sandwich. A decade later, food trends\u2019ll move onto something else, and we\u2019ll forget the Bao craze even happened. Because at their core, most of these dishes are\u2026 forgettable.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be too much of a critic. The food industry is hard\u2026 I don\u2019t blame any chef for doing what they have to to make a decent living (it\u2019s really food media that can be cringy). But I think we can do better. One way out of functional fixedness is the \u201cgeneric parts technique\u201d. If you don\u2019t mind a quick copy/paste:\n\n>For each object, you need to decouple its function from its form. McCaffrey shows a highly effective technique for doing so. As you break an object into its parts, ask yourself two questions. \"Can I subdivide the current part further?\" If yes, do so. \"Does my current description imply a use?\" If yes, create a more generic description involving its shape and material. For example, initially I divide a candle into its parts: wick and wax. The word \"wick\" implies a use: burning to emit light. So, describe it more generically as a string. Since \"string\" implies a use, I describe it more generically: interwoven fibrous strands. This brings to mind that I could use the wick to make a wig for my hamster. Since \"interwoven fibrous strands\" does not imply a use, I can stop working on wick and start working on wax. People trained in this technique solved 67% more problems that suffered from functional fixedness than a control group. This technique systematically strips away all the layers of associated uses from an object and its parts.\u201d\n\nThis is why so much innovation in food happened around the Columbian exchange, I feel. People were introduced to novel new ingredients, *not* novel new foods. So you get interesting shit like people in Guizhou fermenting tomatoes into a paste and using it as a base for sour soup catfish hotpot, or people in France pounding potatoes until sticky and mixing it with cheese.\n\nSo I think one good way to make more\u2026 organic fusion is to simply grab an ingredient from another culture and just keep it in your fridge. Bonus points if you have no fucking clue how it\u2019s actually used. In time, you\u2019ll find what to do with it. \n\nLike, with the burgeoning popularity of *Lao Gan Ma* chili crisp, I heard some people online talk about how they liked it together with a bagel and cream cheese. I thought that sounded weird as hell, so obviously I *had* to try it. And you know what? Pretty good. Weirdly works well together - *vastly* more interesting than anything I\u2019ve seen out of these \u2018fusion-y\u2019 restaurants. Because anyone can mix together some fish and shit and call it \u2018poke\u2019. Lao Gan Ma with cream cheese? That\u2019s the kind of vision that only the most desperately inebriated could possibly concoct\u2026   \n\n**A list of stuff that we\u2019ve cooked during this lockdown:**\n\nNow, I think I probably over emphasized my points in these last two rambly\u2026 sections. I\u2019m obviously no visionary chef. I hold precisely zero illusions otherwise. I\u2019m going to list out the stuff we\u2019ve whipped up in the past two weeks, and you\u2019ll probably say to yourself \u201cuh, dude\u2026 really, that\u2019s it? The David Changs of the world make **way** more interesting stuff than that\u201d. And\u2026 I\u2019d 100% agree. Not claiming otherwise.\n\nWhat I *would* say though is that I do think some of these concoctions have been surprisingly good. And this? This is from just *two weeks* of staying inside. Could you imagine an entire *society* of people with a *lifetime* of experience with the same sort of mindset? Think of all the stuff they\u2019d invent! No wonder traditional food is so damn interesting the world over\u2026 \n\nIn any event, in rough order of how much I liked them:\n\n1.\t[Guizhou-style Laoguo sizzling pan stir-fry, with Oaxaca cheese, Lao Gan Ma, and flour tortillas.](https://streamable.com/r2zt1)  So in Guizhou there\u2019s a style of eating called *Shuicheng Laoguo* - looks [like this](http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20190618/07cd96e5eacb4fc586d52e083ad60463.jpeg), basically you toss a stir-fry on a sizzling pan and slowly munch on it (though some varieties\u2019ll also toss raw stuff on the pan to let it cook/toast). This was mixed vegetables with black pepper pork chop, seasoned with mianchi (red miso), Hunan chili sauce, soy sauce, Hoisin, and chili garlic sauce. Usually it\u2019s dipped in seasoned chili flakes, but we\u2019ve just been using Lao Gan Ma black soybean chili. For the Oaxaca cheese, we just melted it on the pan bit by bit\u2026 then tossed in a flour tortilla (I know those were kinda overly thick, was trying out a new recipe) \u2013 the mix of Oaxaca cheese and douchi really, really worked. Heavily recommended, this was awesome \u2013 some restaurant should really serve this somewhere (probably in Guizhou\u2026 would be way easier to convince Guiyuang people to eat Laoguo with Mexican cheese than try to educated American restaurant-goers how to eat Laoguo-style). Really, the more I pay around with the flavors I kinda think Gui-Mex should be the thing lol. This would be even better with masa tortillas imo.\n\n2.\t[Tomato sauce with spicy fermented paste over Northern Chinese \u2018cat ear\u2019 noodles, with stuffed  lotus root on the side](https://i.imgur.com/2ntMOSe.jpg). I know this really doesn\u2019t look like much, but we got a small shipment of tomatoes one day and I thought to myself \u2018eh, alright, I\u2019ll whip up a quick roasted tomato sauce, why not\u2019. No onion\u2026 but hey, whatever. I was running a touch low on tomato paste, so on a whim I reached for Guizhou fermented tomato paste \u2013 it\u2019s the base of the aforementioned sour catfish hotpot, slightly spicy and pretty intensely sour. At first I was kinda pissed at myself for potentially screwing up the tomato sauce \u2013 the sour notes were totally cool, but the heat was\u2026 distracting. Sliced up a bit of carrot, tossing it in with water to let it all cook down. After that and seasoning with a bit of sugar, MSG, fish sauce, and black pepper\u2026 it actually really, really worked. Topped it over some freshly whipped up cat ear noodles, and ate alongside stuffed lotus root.\n\n3.\t[Blended Mexican-style hotsauce with Sichuan chilis and Laozao fermented rice](https://i.imgur.com/A9Fckza.jpg). This one is kind of cheating because it was something that I first developed with a buddy of mine who runs a Mexican restaurant in Shenzhen. The original task was \u201cmake a house hot sauce that\u2019s kind of like Tapatio but using Chinese chilis\u201d. I ended up being really proud of the stuff. I won\u2019t bore you will all of the details, but two cool points I think are (1) the water the chilis are blended with are soaked with Sichuan peppercorn \u2013 if you soak Sichuan peppercorn in this way, you\u2019ll only get the floral quality, not the numbingness and (2) the vinegar is rice vinegar, Laozao fermented rice was also tossed in. The latter bit adds a bit of sweetness and a *lot* of complexity. This stuff was perfect drizzled on Mac N Cheese.\n\n4.\t[Pan-fried Guozengzong with the aforementioned hot sauce.](https://i.imgur.com/gQNHPEV.jpg) Steph\u2019s mother\u2019s side is from Zhaoqing \u2013 city outside of Guangzhou renowned for their Zongzi (sticky rice dumplings). [This is what they look like](https://i.imgur.com/HdU5To6.jpg) \u2013 the best sort are stuffed with fatty pork belly and mungbean. It\u2019s a tradition to make them around Chinese New Year, and after swinging by to Steph\u2019s parent\u2019s place we got\u2026 loaded up with a bunch of them. In Vietnam they\u2019ve also got a *very* similar thing called banh chung, which they\u2019ll sometimes smush down into a pan and fry it. Pan-frying this stuff is *awesome*, and it also went great dipped in that vinegar-y hot sauce above.\n\n5.\t[Pork Belly and Kimchi Sandwich](https://i.imgur.com/Cht9BwW.jpg). Ate way too many of these things. This was thinly sliced pork belly that we had in the freezer from testing Suanni Bairou \u2013 Sichuan Spicy Garlic Pork. Basically, the pork belly is blanched until cooked through, then left to sit in the pot for ~3 hours to get a bit more tender. You slice it super super thin\u2026 like, 1mm wide. Makes for an ideal sandwich meat to be honest.  Roughly equal parts pork belly to kimchi (maybe a touch more pork belly), together with a spread of equal parts Kewpie mayo, Dijon mustard, and Kimchi pickling juice. This was on some homemade crunchy wheat bread but I think that Rye would probably work best. Just a simple, good thing. Tried it with cheese inside too... doesn\u2019t need it.\n\n6.\t[Yunnan colored steamed rice with fried pork mince and pickled chili, together with the aforementioned hot sauce](https://i.imgur.com/6k7ZoGx.jpg). The mince was done by hand, ala Macanese minchi. Really great stuff to top over rice, but unlike minchi Steph also tossed in some Hunan pickled chilis in (which can really bring the heat). Great with the hot sauce. The bit on the bottom left is just some (totally not homemade) Teochew taro roll that we had in our freezer.\n\n7.\t[Stir-fried Mantou Buns](https://i.imgur.com/1uNJiib.jpg). We were doing a Mantou (steamed bun) video for the channel, so we\u2019ve had a lot of leftover Mantou. One thing we\u2019ve heard that in the North of China, some people\u2019ll cube leftover mantou and actually stir-fry them. We have no idea if this is actually how people do it, but on a whim Steph *very* lightly oiled a wok, toasted/fried the Mantou until golden brown, and seasoned with the same Chinese BBQ spice mix that you\u2019d have on cumin roast lamb. Pretty awesome, very reminiscent of the grilled Mantou buns that you get at Chinese BBQ joints.\n\nAnd again\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to say that our cooking is awesome, or interesting, or anything. I know a solid chunk of you probably clicked on a couple of those links and thought to yourself \u201cI dunno, looks kinda shitty\u201d. We\u2019re no chefs. There\u2019s a reason we devote ourselves to researching authentic dishes/techniques to the very best of our ability\u2026 because precisely no one is interested in \u201c/u/mthmchris and /u/leeleesteph\u2019s wacky fusion fun hour\u201d.\n\nWhat I *am* saying though is that this all\u2019s forced us to be the most inventive cooks we\u2019ve ever been in our entire lives\u2026 and this\u2019s just from two nobodies with a camera over the course of two weeks. Imagine millions of people, many lifetimes over, with the same mindset. \n\nIterate that function for a while. **That** is why \u2018authenticity\u2019 in food is a valuable goal, despite it being a\u2026 controversial word in many circles. It\u2019s not that cuisine can never change, or that there\u2019s only *one* recipe for any given dish. It\u2019s about respecting the idea that (1) the generations that came before us were probably much better cooks than we are and (2) you can generally find a lot more interesting food by looking *back*, by peeking in dusty corners, than you can by inventing your own hack or whatever.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that we all can\u2019t be inventive, or have fun being creative. But when I\u2019m saying that I want an \u201cauthentic\u201d version of say, Bouillabaisse sauce\u2026 what I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m looking for a recipe that is connected to and respects those cultural traditions.  \n\n**What else we\u2019ve eaten**\n\nOf course, not everything\u2019s been mashups or whatever. Lots of bread and noodles (heavily recommend Ken Forkish\u2019s *Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast* by the way\u2026 having some nice western-style bread during this time\u2019s been awesome). The aforementioned *Laoguo*, Cantonese claypot rice, and Mac N\u2019 Cheese have been other staples (luckily the 7/11 near us sells small cartons of fresh milk).\n\nBut probably what we\u2019ve eaten the most of has been Mantou \u2013 steamed buns. Mantou with chili crisp (if steamed) or condensed milk (if fried) has been my go-to snack. We\u2019ve had a lot of them from testing them for the channel, but they\u2019re so great to have around that we\u2019re actually whipping up more, even after we\u2019ve made the video (a rarity for us, usually we\u2019re so tired of a dish after testing it\u2019s months before we circle back).\n\nSo to actually give you **some** actual content here, outside of my insane bourbon-and-cabin-fever-induced ramblings\u2026 here\u2019s how to make some Mantou.\n\n## How to Make Mantou Buns\n\nSo there\u2019s three primarily types of Mantou buns:\n\n1.\t*Northern Laomian Mantou.* In the North, mantou are traditionally made with a sourdough starter called *laomian* (\u8001\u9762), which\u2019s then mixed with alkaline ingredients like sodium carbonate to balance the taste. They come in two varieties \u2013 hard and soft. The taste itself is rather plain because they\u2019re meant to be eaten alongside other things as a meal.\n\n2.\t*Southwestern Laozao Mantou.* A really interesting Mantou from Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan\u2026 this kind of Mantou also uses a starter, but interestingly uses fermented rice (\u91aa\u7cdf) to make it. Usually yeast is also added to the dough as well, making for some super-fluffy Mantou.\n\n3.\t*Southern Mantou.* These Mantou are a bit sweeter, and rely on baking powder and yeast. I\u2019d venture that these are probably the most common Mantou that you can find at restaurants, especially abroad.\n\n\nEventually we\u2019ll want to cover all three, but the southern mantou are the most straightforward of the bunch so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll show you today.\n\n[Video is here if you\u2019d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/R3P0OFHqv-c). Seeing as there\u2019s not really too much to this, I\u2019ll try to be a bit more brief from here on out.\n\n**Ingredients, Mantou Buns:**\n\nBaker\u2019s percentages in brackets. I\u2019ll try to remember to do this.\n\n1.\t*All Purpose Flour (\u4e2d\u7b4b\u9762\u7c89), 200g.* For reference the AP we use here in China is 10.8% protein.\n\n2.\t*Water, 90g.* Divided into two bowls, each with 45g. We\u2019ll get to why in a second. [45%]\n\n3.\t*Sugar, 20g.* [10%]\n\n4.\t*Instant Dry Yeast (\u9175\u6bcd), 1 tsp.* Or 2 grams. [1%]\n\n5.\t*Baking Powder (\u6ce1\u6253\u7c89), 1 tsp.* Or 2 grams. [1%]\n\nAnd if you end up deep frying these, you\u2019ll also want the totally-mandatory condensed milk to dip them in.\n\n**Process, Mantou Buns:**\n\n1.\t*Thoroughly mix the sugar with half the water and the yeast in a separate bowl with the other half.* This dough has a *lot* of sugar and yeast in it. Because a high-sugar environment can actually draw moisture out of and damage yeast, we\u2019ll keep these separate for now.\n\n2.\t*Sift together the flour and the baking powder.*\n\n3.\t*Slowly drizzle in the yeast water into the baking powder/flour, aiming for the dry bits. Then do the same with the sugar water.* I always like mixing with a single chopstick for this kind of step.\n\n4.\t*Knead for eight minutes.* Or alternatively in a stand mixer on speed 1 for the same time (dough hook attachment). [This is the final consistency you\u2019re looking for](https://i.imgur.com/KttlAa3.png).\n\n5.\t*Cover, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.*\n\n6.\t*Either by hand or using a pasta maker on the widest setting, roll the dough out thin. Fold it in half, then pass it through again \u2013 six times in all.* This step will get us that classic smooth skin that Southern-style Mantou are known for.\n\n7.\t*With the dough in a sheet now, tightly roll it all up into a log, then roll it a touch longer by hand to get something ~25cm long.* \n\n8.\t*Flour a work surface, place the log on, and gently press down on the bottom.* Very gently, just enough to get a bit of an indent in order to get that classic Mantou shape.\n\n9.\t*With a sharp knife, slight the roll into eight pieces.* Don\u2019t try to use a bench scrape for this step \u2013 being less sharp, it\u2019d slightly press down on the Mantou and muff up the looks. \n\n10.\t*Place the mantou on some squares of parchment paper, then in a steamer. Toss the steamer over a wok filled with 28C water, and proof for 15 minutes.* Just for standardization sake. \n\n11.\t*Over the same water, swap your flame to medium-high and bring it to a boil. Once you can see steam pluming out of the crack of the steamer, set your timer for five minutes.* We\u2019re steaming this gently so that the Mantou doesn\u2019t rise too fast and form air bubbles on the surface of the skin.\n\n12.\t*After that time, shut off the heat and don\u2019t peak for five minutes.* Then after those five minutes, take them out and enjoy!\n\nNote that one common problem is for the skin of the Mantou to come out a bit wrinkly. This means that you either over-proofed the Mantou or steamed at too high of a heat. It\u2019s ok if one or two out of the batch has a couple wrinkles \u2013 you\u2019d rather these be overly fluffy than under-fluffy, after all \u2013 but make adjustments if it\u2019s the whole batch.\n\n**How to Deep Fry Mantou:**\n\nOne of the best things you can do with these southern-style Mantou is deep fry them. A couple cups of oil in a wok, heat it up to 175C. Mantou in, and after about 30 seconds give them a flip. Fry for another minute under golden brown, flipping periodically. Out.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to use up slightly stale mantou, and perfect dipped in way too much condensed milk.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/f0qjm9/what_the_coronavirus_forcing_me_in_lockdowns/", "created_utc": 1581162085.0, "score": 5546, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 227, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/f0qjm9/what_the_coronavirus_forcing_me_in_lockdowns/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I mean maybe this\u2019s the reason why I sometimes tasted saltiness?

Air-chilled\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the saying \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d, right? Keep that in mind as I explain this. \n\nIn the US, more than 95% of chickens are processed using a liquid-cooled solution^[1](https://www.bellandevans.com/healthy-living/chlorinated-chicken-concerns-europe-overreacting/). This means they are submerged in ice-cold chlorinated water, and after this, some are then injected with a salt water brine solution, sometimes referred to as broth. As a result of this process, the chicken retains some of that water. It is easy to identify this if you read the fine print on the packaging. See examples below:\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 1%](https://i.imgur.com/gBSVam6.jpg)\n\n[Tyson brand, up to 3%](https://i.imgur.com/Vj333Dw.jpg)\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 10%](https://i.imgur.com/eRMgQr7.jpg)\n\n[Walmart brand, up to ***15%!!***](https://i.imgur.com/IBhQILK.png)\n\n\nFrozen chicken breasts are most often the ones that are also injected (sometimes called enhanced) with a salt water brine, and usually contain up to 15% retained water^[1](https://i.imgur.com/itbyASa.png) ^[2](https://i.imgur.com/eZS9RaD.jpg)\n\nSo why does this matter? Put simply, it is diluting the chicken flavor and changing the texture. Also, the weight of the chicken you are buying is calculated after it is injected or cooled in a bath. That means you are paying chicken prices for this added salt water.\n\nAir-chilled chicken is just as it sounds. Instead of submerging the chicken in ice-cold chlorinated water, these chickens are essentially chilled in a massive refrigerator. This is actually more expensive for the manufacturers, so that translates to higher prices for consumers. At my local grocery store, air chilled chicken breasts are over 3x the cost of standard chicken breasts ($1.99/lb vs $6.69/lb). Whether or not that is worth it is up to you, but I can tell you that I will never go back to the cheap breasts again. Again, just check the labels. Anything that is air-chilled will be labeled as such. See [here](https://i.imgur.com/AgzIUgl.jpg), [here](https://i.imgur.com/0OT2Z5Z.png), and [here](https://i.imgur.com/p4PoL8u.jpg). \n\nWhat about organic chicken? Well, not all organic chicken is air-chilled, and not all air-chilled chicken is organic. I personally do not think *organic* air-chilled chicken is worth the extra cost (around $10/lb near me), it does not taste any better than non-organic *air-chilled* chicken, in my experience. Keep in mind that any company that is producing air-chilled chicken is likely more concerned about producing a quality product than a company that is using liquid cooling. \n\n## 2. Cutlets \nPart of the challenge when cooking chicken breast is having a tapered piece of meat that will always cook unevenly. This will result in the thin side being completely overdone when the thickest side is perfect. Or if the thin side is perfect, the thickest side is still raw. So the only way to combat this is to make the entire piece the same thickness. [Enter the cutlet](https://i.imgur.com/egyDjGE.jpg). \n\nYou will absolutely need a very sharp knife for this, but since that is arguably the #1 most important tool in the kitchen, it\u2019s safe for me to assume that you already have one of those, right? I like to use a boning knife for this, but a chef\u2019s knife will work. \n\nIf your chicken breasts have the tenderloin still attached, you will want to cut that off and cook it separately because it will create an air pocket, and sometimes things will not cook properly if it is still attached. [See here](https://youtu.be/2BeQftjYNO4?t=21). Just think of it as a bonus for the cook.\n\nNow this next step is sort of optional, but if you are working with very large breasts (around 7-9 ounces each), then I consider it mandatory. Use your very sharp knife that you most definitely already have, and slice that chicken breast in half *horizontally*. [See here](https://youtu.be/MrVIHL7JkTM?t=126). Alternatively, you can cut them in half *vertically* first, and then slice the thicker end in half horizontally. This will create smaller portions, if you would like, and it will be a bit easier to cut them horizontally. [See here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=23).\n\nNow that you have your portions ready, you need to ensure they are all an even thickness by *gently* pounding them to about \u00bc\u201d-\u00bd\u201d thickness. Emphasis on gently because it is very possible to explode your chicken breasts. Lay some plastic wrap over the chicken cutlets and use a meat pounder or mallet on the thickest parts of the cutlets. The key is to create an even thickness, it doesn\u2019t really matter how thick they actually are. You will see this process in the video I linked to above. If you do not have a meat pounder or mallet, you can use a small pot. \n\n## 3. Salt \nThis should be a very deliberate thing. Salt and savory cooking are a package deal. There should never be a time where you forget salt, because it should just be second nature to add salt to things that you want to taste good. Bland and lacking salt are synonymous. \nWhen it comes to cooking chicken (and meat in general), it should be even more deliberate. Salt not only enhances the flavor of our food, but in the case of chicken breast, it actually helps to retain much of the liquid that is lost during the cooking process, and creates more tender cooked chicken. [Here](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/the-food-lab-the-truth-about-brining-turkey-thanksgiving.html) is a very thorough write-up if you want to read more about it. \n\nOn top of retaining more liquid, it obviously adds flavor, but it\u2019s very easy to add too much, or too little. We\u2019ve all heard that we should \u201csalt to taste\u201d, but there are some things where this doesn\u2019t work very well, like salting your raw chicken breast before cooking it. Fortunately, the good folks at [Cook\u2019s Illustrated have this figured out for us](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5681-salting-meat) (the formatting of that page seems to be broken currently). I can personally attest that the amount of salt listed in the aforementioned article is perfect, for my and my family\u2019s tastes, you may want a bit more or a bit less. \u00be teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pound of boneless poultry is what they suggest. The brand of salt is also very important. If you aren\u2019t already aware, 1 teaspoon table salt = 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton kosher salt = 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt^[1](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5799-salt-types-and-measurements)\n\nSo let\u2019s look at a realistic example: Say you bought a package of fresh air-chilled chicken breast and the total weight listed on the package is 1.67 pounds. How much salt do you add? ***Edit: this part is not true!*** ~~Well, for starters, that weight is for the entire package of chicken, not just the meat you are going to be eating. Surprise! That\u2019s right, grocery stores weigh the entire package when printing their labels, so you are paying for the packaging as well.~~ So if you start with a package that is 1.67 pounds, you can safely round down to 1.5 pounds, so that means 1.5 teaspoons of Diamond Crystal brand kosher salt, or \u00be teaspoon of any fine table salt. \n\n*When* you add the salt is also very important. Unlike spices and herbs, salt actually penetrates fully throughout the meat, and it does so at a rate that increases as the temperature increases. \n\nAssuming you have cutlets and pounded them thin, next you will want to sprinkle on the appropriate amount of salt, let it sit on a plate or baking sheet at room temp while you continue prepping the rest of your meal. Since this should be your first step, your chicken will only be sitting out for about 30 minutes at room temp, so it is perfectly safe. \n\nBecause salt is hygroscopic, it will begin to draw the moisture out of the chicken, which will in turn dissolve the salt, and then most of that salt water will be reabsorbed back into the chicken. You can actually watch this process happen if you take a close look at your salted chicken every 5 minutes or so. \n\nAt this point, feel free to take whatever creative measures you wish with any other spices or herbs. But the point should remain that salt is the #1 concern at this stage. In fact, a properly salted chicken breast will taste good without the addition of any other spices or herbs. I would even suggest that you try this first so that you can establish a baseline for what good chicken should taste like.\n\nNext, before cooking, there is one final semi-optional step. I say semi-optional because I think the only exception for skipping this is if you have Celiac disease or are counting calories. \n\n### 3a. Flour\n\nCoating your cutlets in a very light layer of flour will protect the outer surface of the chicken from the high heat and it prevents the edges of the chicken from becoming too dry. It really does wonders for the final product. You can see this process in one of the previous videos I linked to, [here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=111). You only need a couple tablespoons of flour per breast, this is not fried chicken. Even if you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, I\u2019m sure you could simply use alternative flours for this. \n\n## 4. Cook\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we talk about temperature first. I think the #1 concern for most people about cooking chicken is that you ensure it is cooked thoroughly, as to kill off any salmonella that may be present. The FDA/USDA tells us that we should cook our chicken to 165F because that is the temperature that salmonella (and most other bad bacteria) are killed instantly at, and this just simplifies everything so that there is only one standard to remember, and it is safe for all types of immune systems. What they are not telling you is that bacteria (including salmonella) can be killed off by both temperature *and* time. This is how we pasteurize dairy products without cooking them. You hold them at very specific temperatures for very specific amounts of time. \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about temperatures. Remember, 165F is the temp in which bacteria are killed *instantly*. Unfortunately, your chicken is damn near overcooked at this point. You can safely cook your chicken to 150F as long as it maintains a minimum of 150F for just 3 minutes. [This source](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/07/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-chicken-breast.html) has a very clear time and temperature chart for a reference, and all data comes from the same people that told you to cook to 165F. So once your chicken reaches a minimum of 150F in the thickest part (since you\u2019ve presumably made evenly sized cutlets, there should be no drastically different \u201cthickest part\u201d), you want to pull it from the hot pan and let it sit on a plate (ideally a warmed plate) for at least 5 minutes. Remember to check the temperature in several different spots of the chicken so you can be sure. During the resting time, the temperature will actually rise a bit, thanks to carry over cooking, by about 2-5 degrees or so. Thicker cuts rise more, thinner cuts rise less. If it actually reaches 155F, then everything bad will have been killed off in less than 48 seconds. \n\nI will add a disclaimer here to say that if you are cooking for any children, elderly, pregnant women, or otherwise immunocompromised, cooking to 165F is always the safest option. \n\nSo if you haven\u2019t figured this out yet, you will absolutely need a digital instant read thermometer. This isn\u2019t something you can or should guess at. The thermometer is mandatory, it\u2019s as simple as that. I can provide some good recommendations for different budgets if you would like.  \n\nI will always opt for pan frying in this case. I do not think baking thinly sliced chicken breasts with a light coating of flour will work well. In fact, this entire post is basically to discourage people from trying to bake their oversized chicken breasts in the oven. It\u2019s just not a good method, for many reasons. We really need the high heat and direct contact of a skillet to achieve some browning. Browning things creates new flavors, it is important, and it should be something you are deliberately trying to achieve. \n\nI prefer a stainless steel pan for this, but cast iron will work as well. You want to pre-heat your pan over med-high heat with at least 2 tablespoons of oil in it. You will need slightly more oil than you would normally use, as the light coating of flour will soak up a good amount of the oil. Once that oil begins to shimmer and then you see the first wisps of smoke, it is time to add the chicken. \n\nWe are using a hard and fast cooking style. Since these cutlets are so thin, they will cook very quickly, so we want to achieve a deeply browned exterior before overcooking the middle, which is only possible over fairly high heat. \n\nSlowly lay down each cutlet into the hot oil so that you are moving your hand away from you, as to avoid any hot oil splashes. You should hear a hard sizzle almost immediately, this is a good sign. Most 12\u201d skillets should be able to easily fit 3 cutlets at one time, maybe 4 depending on the size of chicken. This is also a good time to use a splatter screen, if you have one. \n\nAfter adding the chicken, you may want to turn the heat up to high, but be ready to turn it back down again if things get too dark, too quickly. Let the chicken cook undisturbed until the edges of the chicken begin to turn white. Then it\u2019s time to start peaking at the bottom. It\u2019s probably a good idea to rotate each cutlet 180 degrees so that they brown more evenly. You probably have some hotspots in your pan. Once each cutlet achieves a deeply browned surface on the one side, then flip it. If you notice the pan is rather dry when you flip it, add more oil to the spot that is dry. Now keep cooking the second side until you reach a minimum 150F internal temp. You should be more concerned about this temperature than you are about browning on the second side. Now pull each cutlet and transfer them to a warmed plate to rest for 5 minutes. \n\n## Bonus - Pan Sauces\nSo now that you have your pan-fried chicken cutlets resting, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to make a pan sauce. In fact, this cooking method is worth doing just for this opportunity alone. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t use a nonstick skillet, you should now see a lot of [built up brown bits](https://i.imgur.com/M45PnAv.jpg), called fond, on the bottom of your pan. If you did use a nonstick skillet, well, then no fond for you! If the fond looks black and burnt, your heat was too high for too long, and you should skip this step. \nPut your pan back on the heat, medium heat is fine. Get your fond hot, and before it starts to darken, you need to add liquid. You can simply add water, but chicken stock is a better option. If you have it, some white wine along with the water or stock is also a great idea. How much? It doesn\u2019t really matter. Maybe enough so that it\u2019s at least \u215b\u201d deep. Now, bring it to a simmer, and use a flat wooden spoon and start scraping all of that fond up until the bottom of the pan is completely clean. Once you\u2019ve achieved that, let it simmer until it\u2019s reduced slightly. The residual flour in the pan should help thicken the sauce ever so slightly. It\u2019s easy to over reduce at this point, since you are using a wide and shallow pan, so take it off the heat as soon as it\u2019s where you want it. \n\nAt this point, you just need to stir in 1-2 tablespoons of butter and then give it a taste. Add salt until it tastes good. That\u2019s about as simple as you can go, or you can do any of the following to make it even better\n\n* Before adding the liquid, add 1 tablespoon of flour to the fond and cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, or until the flour begins to toast. This will add more flavor and more body to the pan sauce.\n\n* Along with the flour, add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, and cook until the tomato paste turns rust colored. This adds even more flavor. \n\n* To your cold water or boxed stock, sprinkle on a packet of unflavored gelatin and allow it to bloom for a couple minutes before adding to the hot pan. This adds more body to your pan sauce. You don\u2019t need to do this if you are using homemade stock. \n\n* Before adding the liquid, add some minced shallots and a bit of oil to the hot pan and cook for a couple minutes.\n\n* After adding the butter, whisk in some fresh lemon juice and capers or dijon mustard. The addition of acid is almost always a good idea. \n\n---\n\nLastly, a message to all of the chicken thigh cult members out there, because I know that you are a passionate bunch.

{"title": "Toum is an insanely fluffy garlic sauce that comes from the Levant, and Shatta is a spicy fiery chilli sauce served all over the Middle East. Together they are the perfect condiments for sandwiches and grilled foods, full recipes inside", "selftext": "If you buy a shawarma or grilled meat sandwich at any Middle Eastern restaurant, you've likely had both these sauces without realising. They're so ubiquitous in Middle eastern cuisines and essential for saucing up anything, I've had them with dozens of different foods and have yet to find one they don't go with. [Here's how my sauces turned out](https://imgur.com/a/3Wb4GIW)  \n\n  \nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link to the full video recipe](https://youtu.be/ifOlf3COK4s)\n\n## What are Toum and Shatta\nToum in arabic means garlic, and it's also the name given to a specific garlic sauce from the Levant region of the Middle East. It's made by finely grinding garlic into a paste, then emulsifying it with oil and lemon to make a fluffy and delicious garlic sauce. It is closely related to the [Spanish Aioli](https://www.sweetandsabroso.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/18-2557-post/Alioli-with-Ingredients01.jpg), though there is a slight difference in colour and texture. The sauce is also called Thomeya in some countries and has become synonymous with Shawarma partly due to the spread of [Syrian shawarma](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ad/98/72/ad9872f27e3c157e178a4f098bf4aec9.jpg) stores throughout the region. Though most countries in the region have their own garlic sauces of some form, few have earned the reputation that Toum has. The primary difference between Toum and most of the other garlic sauces, is that Toum is very simply an emulsion of garlic and oil, other sauces such as the Egyptian Thomeya, or the saudi version usually contain Cream, Milk or eggs. The exclusion of these and the creation of a real stable emulsion, results in a fluffy sauce with the texture of a mayonnaise but 100% vegan, which means it can last a whole month in the fridge without deteriorating.\n\nI've had Toum with all manner of foods, from falafel and shawarma, to pizza and chicken wings, and they've all been great. I find that it's also a great mayo substitute in sandwiches particulary smoked turkey or grilled cheese sandwiches. The only downside to this sauce is that you'll have a serious case of garlic breath for a few hours after eating it, but lifes short and you deserve this sauce.\n\nShatta (pronounced Shut-Ta) is the generic name given to chilli sauce, though it can also be known as Salsa Har (Hot Sauce) and this is usually made using a blend of fresh chillies. Unlike Toum there is no one specific recipe or formula that most people or nations follow and it can vary from restaurant to restaurant let alone city to city. The middle east has a number of famous hot sauces such as North African [Harrissa](https://www.196flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/harissa-1-FP.jpg) and [Yemeni Sahawiq](https://www.afewlovelythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zahawiq-1-e1475235413724.jpg) (I don't know why some people spell it Zhug or Schug) but Shatta is definitely the most widely spread. I spent some time experimenting to put together a sauce that tastes similar to what you get in most shawarma stores, or with grilled meat platters and I think it came out perfectly. This sauce uses a combination of different pepper varieties to build heat at different levels, as well as some spices that round out the flavors.\n\nIf you love sauces, I think you should give both of these a try. They're extremely versatile and can be used to fill sandwiches, spice up some grilled meat or vegetables, or even just eaten with some bread as a dip. \n\n## Historical context\nGarlic has been consumed in the Middle East for thousands of years, even being found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. It was said to be a highly revered ingredient amongst the ancient Egyptians and was thought of as both a food and medicine. In the Ebers Papyrus a pharaonic medical text, garlic is said to give vitality, soothe flatulence and aid digestion, mild laxative, shrinks hemorrhoids, and rids body of \"spirits\". Garlic was also used widely in Mesopotamian cuisine, in what is now the site of the Levantine countries, with many recipes still surviving to this day, such a stew with garlic and leeks. \n\nI couldn't find any specific mention of Toum as a sauce going back in history, but my search was partly complicated by the name Toum also just meaning garlic. While the process of Making toum has changed in the past century with the introduction of the food processor and blenders, it has been made by hand for a lot longer. The traditional way to make Toum is by grinding garlic in a mortar and pestle, then slowly adding in small amounts of oil and working it in. Some restaurants still make it this way, though it is a labor intensive process. It also results in a more solid sauce than the food processor does, and it has a more gloopy texture.\n\nThe chilli didn't make it's way out of South America until the 15th century, but it quickly found a home in the Middle East. Many Middle Eastern dishes already utilized heat producing spices such as Pepper and Cumin in large amounts, so it's natural that chilli peppers quickly became a part of local cuisine. The emergence of an alternative to expensive black pepper and the ease of its cultivation, quickly reshaped many dishes in the area. It's thought that by 1569 Hungary (under the rule of ottomans) began cultivating peppers which later became the base of their national dish.\n\nSince the introduction of the Chilli pepper, there are variations which have become synonymous with Middle Eastern cuisine such as Aleppo Pepper (Pul Biber), which is thought to have been cultivated and bred in Aleppo, Syria. It's not clear when chilli sauce became a feature in Middle Eastern cuisine, but it's likely that it spread through the Ottoman empire, where it was common for popular dishes to quickly make their way across the different territories. Unfortunately it's not easy to identify what varieties are mostly used in the Middle East and getting fresh Aleppo Peppers is very difficult. So this sauce is my closest approximation to how a Shatta would taste.\n\n## Flavor profile\n\n### Garlic Sauce\nThe garlic sauce has an extremely strong garlic flavor that obviously comes from the copious amount of garlic used in the dish. Using fresh garlic will give you a sweeter and more milder garlic flavor, while regular supermarket garlic will give you a more sharp and spicy bite that comes from the Allicin within the garlic. As the garlic ages the amount of allicin grows which is why aged garlic is a lot more pungent. The addition of Lemon Juice adds a necessary brightness and sourness that is desperately needed in the sauce. If you use a neutral vegetable oil (as suggested), you won't get any further flavors in the garlic sauce, however some people do use olive oil and of course that imparts an olive flavor on the sauce.\n\nThe garlic sauce is also notable for its texture, it has a fluffy and creamy texture that is similar to creme fraiche. It's quite a thick yet light consistency owing to the emulsified oil within it.\n\n### Shatta (Chilli Sauce)\nThis chilli sauce recipe has a deep and slow burning heat that is common among Middle Eastern chilli sauces. You do of course get a kick of heat when you first eat it, but it slowly builds thanks to the combination of different Chilli pepper types as well as the addition of some \"hot\" spices. Using fresh chilli peppers also gives you the brightness and freshness that you would expect from eating freshly ground chillies, notably when first made, this sauce will be a little sweet and over the next few days the flavors will develop significantly. The addition of Onion, Garlic and Ginger rounds out the flavor of the sauce so that you aren't just getting a ton of heat. Adding Lemon and Vinegar, turns up the acid in the sauce, which helps make it a bit lighter but also enhances the other flavors.\n\nIn this recipe I used Habaneros, Cayenne Peppers and fresh paprikas. The Habaneros add a large amount of deep burning heat and a fresh fruity flavor. The Cayenne Peppers add some medium heat, that gives a sharp immediate kick and a long sustained burn. Finally the paprikas are there for a deeper more mellow flavor, as well as their delicious fresh fruity flavor. I also roast the peppers to bring out their cooked flavors rather than raw, as I find it helps to make the heat less sudden and better sustained. The addition of Cumin, Coriander and smoked paprika, is there to round out the sauce and add some more traditional middle eastern flavors. \n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Toum (Garlic Sauce)\n* 150g (5.3 Oz) Garlic\n* 135g (about 1/2 cup) Lemon juice\n* 600g (21 oz) Neutral Vegetable Oil - Sunflower preferred\n* 1 Tsp Salt\n\n### Shatta (Chilli Sauce)\n* 100g (3.5 oz) Habaneros\n* 200g (7 oz) Cayenne Peppers\n* 300g (10.5 oz) Fresh Paprikas\n* 3-4 Cloves of garlic\n* 1 Brown Onion\n* 3 Tbsp Olive oil\n* 3 Tbsp Lemon juice\n* 1 Tbsp White vinegar\n* 1 Tbsp Sugar\n* 1-2 Tsp Cayenne Pepper (optional and should only be used if your sauce isn't spicy enough)\n* 2 Tsp Garlic powder\n* 1 Tsp Fresh ginger\n* 1 Tsp Ground cumin\n* 1 Tsp Ground coriander\n* 1 Tsp Salt \n* 1/4 Tsp Smoked Paprika\n\n## Directions\n\n### Garlic sauce directions:\n1. Peel your garlic and slice your cloves in half along their narrow side. In the center is a slightly green or yellow section which looks like a small plant, this is the garlic germ and it tastes bitter, pulling it out will make the garlic sauce taste a lot better. \n2. Remove the [garlic germ](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/03/20180216-bagna-cauda-vicky-wasik-3.jpg) from the center of each clove, it should come out if you bend your clove on either side of the germ, but if you want you can cut it out. You should have 150g after degerming your garlic\n3. Juice about 2 lemons and strain the juice to remove all pulp and seeds, these can cause the emulsification to break and so must be removed.\n4. Place your garlic and salt in your food processor and process until finely minced. This should take about 2 minutes. Every 15-30 seconds scrape down the side of the food processor to get the garlic moving again. The garlic should be very finely minced when you are done with this.\n5. When the garlic is finely minced add a teaspoon of lemon juice and process again for a minute, scraping the bowl every 15 seconds. The garlic should slowly form a thick paste \n6. Add one more teaspoon of lemon and process for another minute or two until a fluffy and fine paste form. There should be no obvious chunks of garlic left and the paste should be well whipped\n7. When the garlic has fluffed up, start your food processor, and slowly drizzle in 1/2 a cup of the oil. You should drizzle it in a flow as thin as a thread, and do not stop the machine until the recipe is completed. It's hard to maintain a constant stream so check my video to see how you can make your own emulsification resevoir out of a plastic cup that will make sure you get a very thin drizzle. As you drizzle the oil in, the garlic will emulsify into a sauce, you should take about 2 minutes with the first half cup.  Do not proceed with the recipe until the first half cup has emulsified and thickened and your food processor contains a mixture that looks like a liquid mayonnaise\n8. Once the first half cup has emulsified you should slowly drizzle in a tablespoon of lemon juice\n9. Alternate drizzling in 1/2 a cup of oil and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice until both have finished. You should drizzle them in as slow as possible. This stage will take about 8-10 minutes. Make sure to wait at least 30 seconds before switching from oil to lemon so that you can ensure it has all been incorporated.\n10. Once completed, place the sauce in a container and place a paper towel directly on the sauce, this will wick away any excess moisture or oil. Let it rest overnight before serving\n\n**I would highly recommend watching the video for this as you need to see the visual queues of when to add your oil and how slow to go with the drizzling, also read the notes below**\n\n### Chilli sauce directions:\n\n**Wear some gloves for this or you will hate your life**\n\n1. Slice the top off of each chilli and remove the pith and seeds\n2. Peel your ginger and slice into thin slivers\n3. Peel your onion and slice into quarters\n4. Place the peppers, onion, ginger and garlic on a baking sheet and drizzle on 1 Tbsp of olive oil as well as 1 Tsp of salt\n5. Bake in a 180c or 350f oven for 20-30 minutes until the chillies are cooked and slightly browned. Remove and let cool before moving forward\n6. Place all the baked ingredients into a food processor and process into a fine paste\n7. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the lemon juice and cayenne pepper, then blend until well mixed and a thick chilli sauce has formed\n8. Taste the sauce and see if it's spicy enough, if not, add the cayenne pepper and blend once more\n9. Add the lemon juice and mix in, your chilli sauce is ready\n10. Place the chilli sauce in a container and refrigerate overnight, the flavors will develop over the next 24-48 hours\n\n## Notes and tips\n\n* The emulsification can break really easily, if your emulsification does not work then check out the serious eats toum video where they explain how you can fix it using an egg white\n* Going slow with your oil and lemon is essential, most food processors will come with an emulsification reservoir that you can add liquid to and it will slowly trickle in. If you don't have one, you can make one by poking a hole in the bottom of a plastic cup\n* Heat is the enemy of an emulsification and so placing your oil in the fridge for a couple of hours before using, will help it setup quicker. You can also place the lemon juice in the fridge as well\n* Make sure your food processor, lid and blades are completely dry before starting. Too much moisture at the start of an emulsification can cause it to break\n* Please wear gloves when handling chillies, I did not and my hands burned for hours afterwards. I tried to clean them with Soap, Vinegar, Alcohol, Lemon Juice, Diluted bleach, Hand sanitizer and nothing really helped that much.

{"title": "Tip: cook rice faster and add more flavor", "selftext": "Sometimes, we want really sticky, globby rice. If that's what you want all the time, disregard the following. \n\nI work at a pizzeria with a Mexican guy from Puebla. He did something to his rice I'd never done before when just making regular rice, and it's something I've been doing ever since. And that is to lightly saute the rice in the pot on high heat with a little bit of oil and spices, for a few minutes, just until some of the kernels start to turn golden/toast colored, and then add warm water. \n\nMy girlfriend loves indian food, and a lot of times I'll add cardamom pods and cumin to the rice, traditionally just steaming the spices in there. Dry sauteing the rice first with the spices bloomed in a little bit of oil has led to very flavorful rice, but it has had a two fold effect, in that it now allows me to cook rice a lot faster. \n\nAfter sauteing for just couple minutes and then adding the warm water, the pot is already so hot that the water comes to a boil within 1 minute. After that, the rice cooks in about 8 minutes.\n\nIt's lovely, adds a great color and flavor to the rice, and allows us to get dinner even faster. Wanted to share the tip, it's completely changed my rice game. I wouldn't recommend it for higher starch sticky rice like sushi rice, but any other time, this is my new move.\n\nEdit: I am aware of what rice-a-roni is, thanks guys.\n\nEdit 2: mentioned it in the comments but I'm cooking this in a stainless steel calphalon pot, which retains heat (not *conducts* heat) better than a normal aluminum pot, and probably contributes to a faster cooking time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hm6c90/tip_cook_rice_faster_and_add_more_flavor/", "created_utc": 1594036832.0, "score": 5319, "author": "FramingHips", "num_comments": 486, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/hm6c90/tip_cook_rice_faster_and_add_more_flavor/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Basic Chinese Knife Skills 101 (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5200\u6280\u5de7) - I sat down and interviewed my dad about how to use, sharpen, and make sure your knives last a lifetime!", "selftext": "Recently I took it upon myself to start documenting my dad's experiences and recipes over his 50 years as a Chinese chef.\n\nHis two knives are among his most prized possessions (they're almost 40 years old, older than I am!)\n\nSo, I figured I'd do an interview with him to learn all of his tips and perspectives on how to use and care for his knives. There's a lot of info in here that applies to all sorts of knives, but the focus is on how he maintains his own knives.\n\nDisclaimer - There are a lot of ways to use and maintain Chinese chef knives. Everything here is just my dad's take on the matter.\n\nEdit: Added a picture of my dad's [40 year old chef knife](https://imgur.com/z7UBMQh)\n\n# A Primer on Chinese Knives\n\nThere are two major types of knives you might find in a Chinese kitchen:\n\n* A Chinese chef knife\n* A Chinese cleaver\n\nOn the blade, there are 3 sections. Each has a different purpose.\n\n* Root - d\u014du g\u0101n \u5200\u6839 (closest to the handle)\n* Belly - d\u014du t\u00f3uh \u5200\u809a (the middle of the blade)\n* Tip - d\u014du j\u012bm \u5200\u5c16 (furthest from the handle)\n\n**The versatility of a Chinese chef knife**\n\nEven though it\u2019s sometimes called a Chinese cleaver, this type of knife is much thinner than other cleavers that are designed to hack through bones or thick meats.\n\nIn Cantonese, it\u2019s called a choi d\u014du (\u83dc\u5200), which literally means \u201cvegetable knife\u201d if you split up the characters. (Also known as a \"cai dao\" in Mandarin.)\n\nA Chinese chef knife is incredibly versatile, like a Swiss army knife without all of its extensions.\n\n* Cutting: You can do everything from julienning vegetables to jointing chickens.\n* Scooping: My dad often uses the blade to scoop and move chopped ingredients around.\n* Crushing: My dad uses the side of the blade as a blunt surface to crush garlic or create purees.\n* Tenderizing: My dad often hits pork with the dull back of the blade to soften meat up.\n\nMy dad's particular chef knife is about 40 years old, which speaks to how well my dad takes care of his stuff as well as the durability of the knife. It's made of stainless steel, with a beautiful wooden handle.\n\nHe uses this knife 95% of the time, replacing an entire set of kitchen knives. There are a lot of great Chinese chef knives out there, but the exact knife my dad uses is Dexter Russell's Traditional 8\"-3.5\" Chef Knife (with a wooden handle.)\n\n**The power of a Chinese cleaver**\n\nThis knife is meant for chopping through thick meats and bones.\n\nIts construction is typically heavier and thicker, and the blade and handle are generally one continuous piece of metal.\n\nWith a meat cleaver, you always chop landing your blows with the root of the knife (closest to the handle).\n\n* Chopping with the root of the knife keeps your knife in one piece.\n* Let's say the blade is 8 inches long. If you were to chop bones with the tip of the knife as opposed to the root of the knife you place \\~8X the amount of reactive force and stress on the handle and on your hands, eventually breaking the handle.\n\nMy dad also will sometimes stick the belly of the knife in place, and then press down with his hands to further drive the blade through a thick piece of root or bone.\n\nMy dad's particular cleaver was made in Jiangmen / Kongmoon, a city in Guangdong Province which is famed for its high quality knives.\n\nThe exact brand is Sanhangwa \u4e09\u6841\u74e6 (which I couldn't find online), and the knife is made of stainless steel.\n\n# How to sharpen a Chinese chef knife\n\n**An overview of the main sharpening tools**\n\nThere are three primary tools my dad uses to sharpen his knives at home and at the restaurant:\n\n* The whetstone\n* The honing rod / steel\n* The dinner plate\n\nNotably, he doesn't use any sort of electronic or machine sharpener, which would quickly ruin the blade.\n\n**Why do we sharpen knives?**\n\nIt\u2019s counterintuitive, but a sharper knife actually causes fewer injuries. Simply due to the law of averages, a sharper knife leads to fewer cuts, which lowers the chance of injury.\n\nAlso, you'll cry less. When cutting an onion, if your knife is dull, you will damage the onion's cell structure and release a chemical called \"lachrymatory factor\", which makes you cry. A sufficiently sharp knife leaves cells intact and eyes dry.\n\n**What makes a knife dull?**\n\nYou can imagine the blade of every knife as having tiny microscopic teeth (like the huge teeth of a serrated knife).\n\nYour knife's effectiveness depends on these teeth to be both:\n\n* Present\n* Aligned\n\n**Honing vs Sharpening Your Knife**\n\nSharpening = New Teeth\n\n* Sharpening means that you're actually removing a relatively significant amount of material from the blade to produce a new sharp edge. This is usually done less frequently.\n\nHoning = Aligning Teeth\n\n* Honing is like giving your knife some braces. It's more of a polish that maintains sharpness. It does remove SOME material, but not nearly as much as running your knife against a whetstone.\n\nIf your knife is dull, you always sharpen first, hone second.\n\n**One-Sided Bevel**\n\nMy dad prefers to sharpen his knife with a one-sided bevel.\n\nThis means that one side of the knife is sharpened at a 15-20 angle, and the other side is sharpened parallel to the stone.\n\nThis is a lot more clear in the video, but if you're holding the knife, the \"palm\" side of the knife is sharpened flat, and the \"fingernail\" side of the knife is sharpened at a slant.\n\nWith a one-sided bevel, slices of meat or vegetable will naturally fall out of the way, which helps my dad be more efficient when cutting lots of stuff (he used to cut 40-50 pounds of meat every day).\n\n**How do you know what angle to sharpen your knife at?**\n\nMy dad sharpens his knife based on intuition, but a great starting point is to go with a 15-20 angle.\n\nTo estimate this, /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt has a wonderful explanation of this in his YouTube video on \"How to Sharpen a Knife with a Whetstone\":\n\n* Take the width of the knife, divide it by 3 or 4, and lift it up by that distance.\n\nWhatever angle you're going with, try to hold your knife at the same angle throughout the entire motion.\n\n**How often do you need to sharpen a knife?**\n\nAt home, my dad sharpens his knives with a whetstone 3 to 4 times a year.\n\nWhen my dad used to work as a chef, he'd use the whetstone every two days, and he'd use his honing rod multiple times a day.\n\n**How do you test the sharpness of your knife?**\n\nMy dad uses his fingernails (like a boss), which was a little jarring to watch at first, but it actually is one of the most convenient and effective ways to test sharpness.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen people testing out their knives by slicing paper. However, this is actually pretty easy to do even with a fairly dull knife, whereas that same dull knife will glide across your fingernail.\n\nI came across a very informative chart (Google: \"Knife Grinders Sharpness Chart.pdf\" that quantifies \"sharpness\" with actual measurements, and the minimum sharpness it takes to perform certain tests.\n\n* Paper: knife starts tearing paper at 1 micron edge (considered dull)\n* Fingernail: knife catches on a nail at 0.7 micron edge (considered a working edge)\n\nThis isn't to say that paper doesn't work as a sharpness test (it's also very fun to do), but if you're a knife, it's a test that's very easy to pass.\n\nAnd practically speaking, as long as you\u2019re careful, it\u2019s a lot easier to use your nail than it is to find a piece of paper, especially if you\u2019re a busy chef in a restaurant like my dad.\u00a0\n\n**Using a whetstone**\n\nThe primary tool my dad uses to sharpen his knife is called a sharpening stone or whetstone, or \"m\u00f2h d\u014du sehk \u78e8\u5200\u77f3\" in Cantonese.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in getting a sharpening stone for yourself, a great starter is the King KDS 1000/6000 whetstone, which you can find on Amazon.\n\nMost brands label their whetstones with one or more \u201cgrit\u201d numbers, which mostly refers to the size of the abrasive particles in the stone. The higher the grit number, the smoother and sharper the finish. The lower the grit number, the quicker the knife\u2019s material gets removed.\n\nIf your knife is dull or even damaged, generally you\u2019d start sharpening your knife with a lower grit rating, and then you\u2019d use a stone with a higher grit rating to get a more razor sharp edge.\n\nHere's an overview of what you'd do:\n\n* *Wet the whetstone* \\- Depending on the stone you get, either splash some water on it or fully submerge it in water. This helps \"lubricate\" the stone.\n* *Flatten your stone* with.. a flattening stone. This ensures that your whetstone's surface is even. (note: my dad didn't do this during our interview)\n* *Sharpen* \\- For my dad's one-bevel method - hold one side of the knife at a 15-20 angle and push it back and forth across the stone. Flip the knife over and lay it flat.\n* *Sharpen again* \\- Depending on how dull or sharp your knife is, you might want to switch to a stone with a higher grit rating (or just flip your stone over if it comes with two grits), and repeat the process.\n\nAdding water generally acts as a sort of lubricant for the friction that\u2019s produced as we sharpen the knife against the stone. The water mixes together with the loose particles from the stone and knife to create a slurry, which helps to further polish the knife\u2019s edge and sharpen the blade.\u00a0\n\nMy dad was also saying that in certain cases, the water helps keep reduce some of the frictional heat, which helps to avoid any potential warping that might occur.\u00a0\n\n**Using a honing rod**\n\nKnown as a m\u00f2hd\u014dugwan \u78e8\u5200\u68cd, my dad used a honing rod multiple times a day when he worked in restaurants.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to do this, but with my dad's one-sided bevel method:\n\n* Hold the rod in your dominant hand, hold the knife in your other hand.\n* Repeatedly run the edge of blade across the rod, holding the slanted-bevel side of the knife with a more pronounced angle than the flat-bevel side of the knife\n\nOne thing to highlight on most honing rods - the handle is slightly flared, so it helps protects your hands from getting cut if you move your knife too far down.\n\n**Using a dinner plate**\n\nIf you don't have a sharpening stone, you can also use the rough bottom of a ceramic plate or cup as a surface to sharpen your knife against.\n\nMy dad HAS a sharpening stone, and still prefers to use a plate sometimes because it's so easy to grab and use.\n\nJust like you would with a whetstone or honing rod, be mindful of the angles you're holding and pushing the knife with.\n\n# How to clean a Chinese chef knife\n\nMy dad uses a sponge with some dish soap and wipes down each side of the blade and handle. The main concern here is just to avoid cutting yourself.\n\nNotably, he is NOT using a dishwasher (for different reasons - I think my parents don't use a dishwasher because they're stereotypically frugal Asian parents.)\n\nI highly recommend against putting your precious knives inside of them for several reasons.\n\nBy doing so, you create an unnecessary risk of injury, and it\u2019s also just terrible for the knife itself.

However, at my local grocery store yesterday, they had a special going on that was $13.99 for a bone-in ribeye. I thought it was too good to pass up, so I got one that was about 1.3 pounds. \n\nGot home and immediately sprinkled with kosher salt and then set on a wire rack in the fridge to dry brine for around 3-4 hours. 45 minutes before cooking, I took the steak out to bring up to room temperature. I ground some pepper and seasoned all over (like I had done previously with the salt). \n\nI set my oven to 270F. On a baking sheet, I crushed about 7-8 cloves of garlic and spread them out about the size of the steak, then covered with thyme sprigs and drizzled olive oil over it.

{"title": "If you've never had Libyan food before, I'd highly encourage you to try Mbakbaka. A one pot lamb and pasta dish that is seasoned with a uniquely warm and earthy spice mix. Recipe and guaranteed enjoyment inside", "selftext": "Most people know very little about Libya, and even less about Libyan culture. It's a country that for millenia has been a cross roads of civilisations and an important trading hub even stretching back to the time of the Romans. With so many cultures overlapping, the cuisine has  come together as part arab, part african, part berber and part european. It's an interesting blend that leads to dishes such as Mbakbaka, a meat stew to which pasta is added. The result is one of the most [amazing and unique pasta dishes](https://imgur.com/a/Wi7Kz3f) I've ever had, and one that is perfectly suited to cold winter evenings. It resembles a traditional Ragu with chunky pieces of meat, however the flavors are far from anything cooked in Italy.\n\nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyMqTA9dfkA) to the full video recipe. I've also left links in the comments to all my previous r/cooking posts.\n\n## What is Mbakbaka\nThis strangely named food is the pride and joy of Libyan people, and is regarded as a quintessential Libyan food. It gets it's name from the noise it makes (bak-bak-bak-bak-bak) as the thickened stew boils when pasta is added. It's put together by stewing meat (usually lamb, but beef or chicken can be used) with a blend of Libyan spices called Bzaar (like Bazaar without pronouncing the first \"a\"), which has a warming and earthy flavor composition. Once the meat is cooked through, pasta is added to the stew, where it absorbs the liquid and gets infused with the flavors of the dish. The end product is a pasta dish that's packed full of flavor, contains perfectly cooked chunks of meat, and a delicious thickened broth. \n\nThe Bzaar spice mix is what makes this dish so unique and delicious, and it's something you can only get premixed in Libya. Just like you have fish mongers, butchers and green grocers, many regions around the world including the Middle East also have [spice shops](https://traveltoeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-Photo-20140731133707.jpg). These spice shops will sell literally hundreds of unique spices and herbal remedies (used for traditional medicine) which they source from every corner of the world. It's also at these spice shops, where they grind and mill whole spices into unique blends that are used in locally cooked dishes. Bzaar itself is a blend of 10+ spices that is uniquely Libyan, but luckily a Libyan friend of mine has a recipe for a homemade Bzaar spice mix, that you can make with store bought spices. Each country can have dozens of unique spice mixes, but because there is no steadfast rules or written recipes on these mixes, every state, city or shop can have differences that make no two blends taste the same. Bzaar is definitely like that, the recipe I have is closer to an Amazigh ([Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers)) recipe, but I learnt that in western Libya they also add ground cinnamon for some extra warmth. To make the Bzaar I first assemble a Middle Eastern 7 spice which combines Pepper, Cumin, Ginger, Cloves, Coriander, Cardamom and Nutmeg. This 7 spice is a versatile spice mix that can be used to season any proteins or vegetables with a Middle Eastern flavor profile. Then I add Turmeric and Caraway to the 7 spice to put together the Bzaar, apart from that there is still paprika and cayenne pepper that goes into the stew.\n\nI opted to use lamb leg cubes for this dish which included pieces of the bone. You can forego the bones and use a softer cut of meat here, however the longer you braise this the more the flavor will develop and so opting to use a slower cooking cut is a great idea. To present it nicely, opt for larger chunks of meat, or get hold of some lamb shanks. You can also make this with beef or chicken, and from what I've read from some Libyan commentors, the chicken one is a great quick alternative and I think the flavors would work really well with it. In terms of pasta, you want to use small elbows or small tube shaped pasta, failing that you can use Penne or a form of Mezzi Rigatoni.\n\n## Cultural context\nLike I mentioned above, Libya has long been a crossroads of civilisations. The exact origins of Mbakbaka are not known however the Bzaar spice mix is thought to have an Amazigh origin. In fact many of the Amazigh foods use Bzaar or similar spice mixes to flavor the dishes. Another important spice mix in Libya is called Hararat and this is a blend of \"hot\" spices, it combines Cinnamon, Cumin, Coriander, Chilli and All spice. Many Libyan dishes are flavored with both Bzaar and Harart such as [Mbatan](https://blog.arousingappetites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_8199.jpg), a potato wedge that is stuffed with a spiced meat mixture (I'll have a recipe for this coming soon). \n\nIn 1911 Libya was invaded by Italy in a war that resulted in the creation of Italian Libya which lasted until 1943 when it was invaded by British and French forces. During this period over 100,000 Italians emigrated to Libya where they made up over 12% of the population. In the 1970s when the Libyan Monarchy was overthrown the remaining Libyan Italians were expelled from the country and only a few hundred remained into the 2000s. Given the significant size of their population and how long they stayed, it is no suprise that some elements of Italian cuisine were Libyan-ised. One of the interesting cultural overlaps is that some Berber tribes were allied with the Italian invasion against the Ottomans, it is thought that Mbakbaka may have come about when Italian and Berber soldiers shared a meal. \n\n## Flavor profile\nThe flavors of this dish definitely fall into the Warm and Earthy category with a pleasing profile that even the fussiest of eaters would enjoy. I would say that this pasta tastes similar to a Jamaican Lamb patty and that's probably due to the large amount of Turmeric in it. While Turmeric can become an overwhelming flavor, it is well balanced with the Caraway and other spices. It's hard to distinguish all the individual spices once they are mixed together, but the flavor of the Bzaar mix can only be described as earthy and warming. The Hot Paprika, adds just the slightest amount of back of the throat heat, and a deep complex Umami Flavor. The other flavors in this dish come from the meat, if you opt for Lamb, you will get the slight gaminess of it in the pasta which I think works really well. If you opt for Beef or Chicken, I suspect that their flavor won't really be obvious.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### 7 Spice Mix: \n(makes 1 Tsp)\n* 1/4 Tsp Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Tsp Ground Cumin\n* 1/8 Tsp Ground Ginger\n* 1/8 Tsp Ground Cloves\n* 1/8 Tsp Ground Coriander\n* 1/16 Tsp Ground Cardamom\n* 1/16 Tsp Ground Nutmeg\n\n### Bzaar Spice Mix: \n(makes 3 Tsp)\n* 1 1/4 Tsp Turmeric \n* 3/4 Tsp Caraway Seeds \n* 1/2 Tsp Coriander \n* 1/2 Tsp 7 Spice \n\n### Mbakbaka: \n(4-5 servings)\n* 1 Kg (2lbs) Lamb Cubes or Beef\n* 500g (1lb) Pasta elbows or small tubes\n* 2 Medium Onions\n* 2-3 Cloves of Garlic\n* 2-3 Green Chillies\n* 1/4 Cup Vegetable Oil\n* 4 Tbsp Tomato Paste\n* 2.5 Tsp Salt\n* 2 Tsp Bzaar mix, you can also add the third if you want\n* 1.5 Tsp Hot Paprika or 1 Tsp Paprika and 1/2 Tsp Cayenne Pepper\n* 500ml (17fl oz) Lamb or Beef stock\n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the Bzaar:\n1. Mix the 7 spice ingredients together into a fine and well mixed powder (you will have twice as much as needed)\n2. Crush your caraway in a mortar and pestle\n3. Add the ingredients for the Bzaar, as well as the freshly ground caraway and 1/2 Tsp of the 7 spice\n\n### To make the Mbakbaka:\n1. Dice your onion into a medium dice, mince your garlic, and slice your meat into large chunks\n2. Add the vegetable oil to a pot on high heat and once heated add half of your meat pieces to the oil\n3. Allow them to sear for 3-4 minutes until they have developed a brown crust, then turn over and sear the other side for 3-4 more minutes\n4. Once seared all over remove the meat and set aside, sear the remaining meat the same way\n5. When all the meat has been seared, turn the heat down to medium and add the onion. Saute for 2 minutes then add your minced garlic in\n6. Saute for 5-7 minutes until the onions have softened and any fond in the bottom of the pot has been deglazed\n7. Add the meat back to the pot as well as any drained liquid, or vegetables you'd like to incorporate\n8. Add the Tomato paste, Salt, Paprika and Bzaar to the pot and add enough stock or water to the pot to cover the meat. Bring to a boil then turn the heat down to medium and cook covered for about 45 minutes or until your meat is cooked through and tender\n9. When the meat is ready, add your pasta to the pot (you do not precook it, it goes into the pot straight fromt the packet). I'd recommend removing any bones before doing this\n10. Add enough (HOT) water or stock to the pot to just cover the pasta and bring the pot to a boil once more\n11. Allow the pot to boil until the pasta is cooked through and the sauce has reduced a little. You should stir it every minute or so to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottomg of the pot\n12. Serve immediately and enjoy\n\n## Notes and tips\n* If you add cold water to the pot with your pasta, it will cause the pasta to stick to the bottom. Your water must be hot\n* You should serve this at a saucey consistency, if it reduces too much just add more hot water and thin it out once more\n* Test your meats doneness before adding the pasta. If it isn't fall off the bone soft then just wait a little longer\n* To use up your remaining Bzaar or 7 spice, try rubbing it onto some chicken thighs or wings before cooking them in the oven", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/k591os/if_youve_never_had_libyan_food_before_id_highly/", "created_utc": 1606915090.0, "score": 5068, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 405, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/k591os/if_youve_never_had_libyan_food_before_id_highly/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "For centuries Middle Easterners have been drinking Sahlab in the Winter. It's a sweet thickened hot drink, that can be flavoured with Coconut, Orange Blossom, or Rose and it's popularity almost caused the extinction of a key ingredient. Recipe for delicious instant Sahlab inside (sans extinction)", "selftext": "If you've visited the Middle East or it's surrounding countries in Winter, you've probably seen people drinking something that looks like a mug of hot milk. What they had in their hands was Sahlab, a thick and sweet hot drink that is loved for its taste and great warming abilities. It's an old drink that was consumed as far back as Ancient Rome, Industrial Britain and all over the ottoman empire, but now has sadly been forgotten to the world except in the Middle East (and a few select countries). Today I'll show you how to make [instant Sahlab powder flavoured with coconut and how to use it](https://imgur.com/a/sqM5Dra), and I'll also tell you how you can make the other varieties as well. \n\nIf you prefer video recipes with all the visual cues, or you'd like to support my work, check out the [full video recipe on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TOAf1ofMQ)\n\n## What is Sahlab or Salep\nIn it's traditional form, Sahlab or Salep is a drink made from crushed orchid tubers. While we think of Orchids as house plants, there are over 20000 different species of orchids, and a large number of them grow [small starchy tubers](https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p04hnc1h.jpg) below the ground. These tubers have a distinctive flavour, which can be described as similar to Taro or a sweet earthy flavour, and they contain an important ingredient for the making of this drink, Glucomannan. Glucomannan is a naturally occurring thickener, and similar to corn starch or konjac it's able to turn a cup of milk into a thick runny liquid. Unfortunately real Salep got so popular that many species of wild orchids were harvested to near extinction in Turkey. As a result the Turkish government has placed bans on the export of Salep powder, and there are only a few producers of sustainable farmed Salep in Greece. The good news is that most drinkers of Salep aren't actually drinking Salep at all. In nearly all countries including Turkey most salep powders are made using a combination of corn starch and other thickeners and flavourings.\n\nInstead of traditional Salep, this recipe makes the variety of sahlab that you'd find in Egypt where it's flavoured with coconut and sesame. The result is a drink that tastes similar to coconut macaroons or coconut cake. Usually the drink is [topped with nuts, sultanas and desiccated coconut](https://imgur.com/R0CLjvq) before serving, which makes for a pleasant drink that you can also chew on. Because of it's thick texture it retains heat really well, and as you drink it you can feel the warm liquid trickling down your throat which is a strangely comforting feeling especially during a cold dessert winter. In some Levantine countries, sahlab is instead flavoured with orange blossom or rose water which results in a bright floral flavour profile. \n\nMost people buy the sahlab mixture premixed from spice vendors or from the supermarket (it's available on amazon US and UK) and it's a simple matter of heating it with some milk to make a warm mug of sahlab. Unfortunately I have found that nearly all premixed sahlab just tastes flat so I experimented until I came up with this recipe. The key ingredient here is Coconut Milk Powder and it's an ingredient that is used in a number of South Asian and Caribbean cuisines, it's essentially dehydrated coconut milk and it gives a strong coconut flavour to the drink. Most recipes I found called for desiccated coconut instead, but I found it resulted in a gritty texture and it had less coconut flavour. Apart from the coconut milk powder, I've also included rice flour in this recipe as it gives the drink a distinct starchy flavour that is present in actual Salep. All the ingredients for the Sahlab are sifted together and the resulting mixture will keep for up to a year in an air tight container. To make a cup of sahlab, you simply heat a cup of milk with a 1/4 cup of the sahlab powder until it thickens, then you garnish it with your desired toppings.\n\n## Cultural Context\n\nLike I mentioned salep is an extremely popular drink and it has been that way for centuries having been drunk by the Ancient romans and later by the Ottomans. Apart from the texture and flavour, Salep was thought to be an Aphrodisiac, so much so that the Ancient Romans called it Satyrion and Priapiscus (I'll leave you to google those). Looking at [how the orchid tubers grow](https://pfaf.org/Admin/PlantImages/OrchisMorio.jpg), you can understand why someone might draw such a conclusion. In fact some theories say that the word Salep comes from the Arabic word Thaalab (\u062b\u0639\u0644\u0628) which means fox, for the resemblance the tubers bear to a foxes anatomy. Last summer I made stretchy ice cream using some Greek Salep powder and it turned out delicious, you can (check out the recipe here)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/i45hy4/every_week_i_cook_a_new_middle_eastern_recipe/]\n\nSalep even made it's way over to [industrial Britain](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/01a6bd_58782d7019d04b7887b568120a74bb0d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_758,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/01a6bd_58782d7019d04b7887b568120a74bb0d~mv2.jpg) where it was sold under the name Saloop. [Carts all over the city](https://janeaustensworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/womansellingsalop.jpg) would sell Salep made using milk or water and using the flour of local marsh orchids. Legend has it that the popularity of saloop declined after its association with venereal disease, and the carts were soon replaced with ones selling coffee and tea instead.\n\nIn the modern Middle East, Sahlab is drunk much the same as Hot chocolate is in the west. It's a sweet treat that you can get at a cafe to warm yourself up, or made at home for when you want to chill out on the sofa. Some people make the mixture extra thick so it can be eaten with a spoon and others chill it and eat it cold as well.\n\n## Flavour Profile\nThe main flavouring of this Sahlab recipe is Coconut, this drink tastes similar to coconut macaroons, bounty chocolates or coconut cake without being too coconutty. You also get a lot of nice flavour from the toasted sesame which gives the drink a slight nutty flavour. The mastic acts as a background flavour, and it gives the drink a light pine aroma, but you likely won't notice if you leave it out. Likewise with the vanilla it's also a background flavour, it just makes the drink taste a bit more rounded and if you leave it out it won't be too impacted. The rice flour gives the drink a starchy flavour similar to horchata and without it, it just doesn't taste the same. Finally the Milk powder gives the Sahlab a slight malted flavour, and a creamier texture.\n\nIf you choose to make the Levantine Sahlab instead, you'll have a bright floral flavour profile.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Egyptian Coconut Sahlab (Makes about 10 measuring cups worth or about 5-6 mugs)\n* 1 Cup Coconut Milk Powder\n* 1/2 Cup Milk Powder (can also be replaced with coconut milk powder for a stronger flavour)\n* 1/2 Cup Rice flour\n* 1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar\n* 3 Tbsp Sesame (1 extra tbsp for topping)\n* 3 Tbsp Corn Starch\n* 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Powder (Vanillin)\n* 1/2 Tsp Mastic\n\n### Levantine Sahlab\n* Replace the coconut milk powder with regular milk powder\n* You can leave out the sesame if you want, it's not always used here\n* Per cup on the stove you'd need to add between 1/2 - 1 Tsp of Orange Blossom or Rose Water\n\n### Possible Toppings\n* Chopped nuts (Pistachio, Almond, Hazelnut)\n* Desiccated coconut\n* Toasted Sesame\n* Sultanas\n* Ground Cinnamon or Cardamom\n\n### Per measuring cup of Hot Sahlab drink\n* 1 Cup (237 ml) of milk\n* 1/4 Cup of Sahlab powder \n\n## Directions\n\n### To toast the sesame\n1. Place the Sesame in a dry pan over medium heat\n2. Shake the pan every 15-30 seconds making sure to rotate your sesame seeds from the bottom to the top of the pan\n3. Toast the sesame until a light golden color, then immediately remove from the pan. They will continue to brown after removal\n\n### To make the Sahlab Powder\n1. Crush the mastic in a pestle and mortar into an extremely fine powder\n2. Sift together all of the ingredients apart from the Sesame seeds. If you don't sift it, the mix will be clumpy and won't evenly combine.\n4. Add the sesame seeds and mix everything together very thoroughly\n5. Store in an air tight container for up to a year\n\n### To make the hot sahlab\n1. Measure your mug of choice in US measuring cups, and multiply the ingredient amounts by the result\n2. Add the milk and Sahlab powder to a pot on medium heat\n3. Whisk together until the mixture thickens (about 5-10 minutes)\n4. Pour out the sahlab into your mug and let it cool for a couple of minutes before topping with any desired toppings\n\n## Tips and tricks\n* Preheat your milk in the microwave to just below boiling to speed up the cooking process, but be careful not to let it boil\n* If you want to make this vegan, you can replace the milk powder with more coconut milk powder and use any replacement milk when cooking\n* You can put some toppings in the base of the mug as well as on top, this makes it easier to decorate while still getting a good amount of toppings\n* If you can't find coconut milk powder, you can use dessicated coconut instead.

{"title": "I tried the \"two ingredient brownie hack\" (banana + cocoa powder) and I have some thoughts.", "selftext": "Somewhere on reddit, I read a claim that you could make \"brownies\" out of nothing but mashed banana and cocoa powder. I filed this away under \"psh yeah right\" until today, when I wanted a dessert, but also didn't want to really bake anything or leave the house. \n\nI went loosely off of [this blog recipe](https://kirbiecravings.com/2-ingredient-healthy-brownies/), but bananas + cocoa powder isn't really rocket science. I used a hand mixer to get the bananas extra liquid and added a pinch of kosher salt because it felt wrong not to. When I tasted the batter, it was way too bitter for me (not really sure what I expected) so I figured one heaping tsp of white sugar spread over three brownies wasn't THAT unhealthy. For reference: I like dark chocolate up to 85%. \n\nMy two small bananas and 3 tbsp cocoa powder made enough batter-like substance for three 'brownies' in a muffin tin. Into the oven for 20 mins at 350, then 30 mins to cool and \"set\" (because without flour or leavener, these don't \"bake.\")\n\n**Test 1: Did they look like brownies?** Absolutely. Good brownies, too. 10/10 visuals, although, this did come around to bite them in the final judging because they looked *too* good. \n\n**Test 2: Did they have the texture of brownies?** Surprisingly, yeah. A nice fudgy texture, soft and rich, like flourless cake. The texture was a high point. \n\n**Test 3a: Did they taste like brownies?** No. As you can imagine, butter and sugar are two important flavor components that can't be replaced by bananas and prayer. \n\n**Test 3b: Did they taste** ***good?*** Surprisingly.... yeah, they were better than I expected. I like bananas, especially in baked goods, and the tiny amount of sugar balanced the chocolate so it was in my acceptable bitterness range. If I had never had brownies in my life, these would be fantastic. Unfortunately, I made a real batch of brownies a week ago, and so the extra-bitter-banana-fudge version suffered by comparison.\n\nThat said, if you're on a diet, you can certainly do worse! They were easy to make, looked like brownies, and were surprisingly edible. Solid B minus. Might even add them to the breakfast rotation down the line. \n\n**tl;dr:** Extra bitter with prominent banana notes. Texture was on point, looked and felt surprisingly like brownies.

It's the savoury cousin of Baklava that is filled with Meat or Spinach, and is one of the crispiest foods in existence. Full Recipe inside", "selftext": "Baklava is definitely the most popular dessert in the Middle East, with dozens of different shapes, sizes and fillings of baklava, it begs the question - has anyone made a \"savoury Baklava\"? The answer to that is Yes, there are many varieties of \"savoury baklava\" that are served throughout the Middle East and Balkan region. You may know this as B\u00f6rek (Burek, Brek) or Spanakopita, but in Egypt and parts of the Middle East [we call it Goulash](https://imgur.com/a/cmiYsrG); layers upon layers of crispy Phyllo (Filo) pastry surrounding a filling made of lightly spiced ground beef. More than being a recipe, Goulash or Borek is a cooking technique that can be applied to any filling you can think of. The result is an extremely crispy pastry filled with a delicious savoury centre.\n\nIf you want to see how I assemble the Goulash, check out the [full recipe video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-ps3IQKnQ)\n\n## What is Goulash (\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0634 \u0623\u0648 \u0643\u0644\u0627\u062c)\nGoulash in the traditional sense of the word refers to a baked Phyllo pastry that is filled with a savoury stuffing. This pastry usually has 16+ layers of phyllo dough, which itself is divided into a top and bottom layer that sandwich the filling. For those of you unfamiliar with Phyllo (Filo), it is an ultra thin pastry sheet (we're talking thinner than paper) that when baked turns extremely crispy. On it's own Phyllo is completely tasteless, and baking a single sheet will not produce a memorable meal. However, when you layer multiple sheets on top of each other and utilise a sweet or savoury filling, the phyllo completely transforms into the perfect vehicle for serving the filling. The most common kind of Goulash that is served in the Middle East is a tray baked goulash that is stuffed with minced beef and onion. This is usually served as a side dish at dinner parties and is a common fixture during the month of Ramadan.\n\nThere are many kinds of savoury phyllo pastries that exist in the region, and one you've probably seen before is [Greek Strifti](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4ad79f406195ce2d0ea5ca40d7c4f3447739cc8a/2b20f/images/uploads/2019_07_11_vegan_spanakopita_2.jpg) or [Turkish Kol boregi](https://i12.haber7.net//haber/haber7/photos/2020/37/pratik_kol_boregi_nasil_yapilir_evde_kol_boregi_tarifi_1599550972_9447.jpg). These are shaped like a spiral and are made by rolling a long sheet of phyllo around the filling before coiling and baking it. Another common kind is [Sigara Boregi](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/KO8YhkDU1VNL1bkqk8zYPH3jd-ExLdsr93mEl-M4JLHzqhNV9iDY-N9vpCB093lAMSc-aNnJSzywtn5sMBIUJh9B8krAoxyJ1ZM0wgwVynF8TFDPz8Fbrh_aWkErfg)(cigarette borek) or [Asabe Goulash](https://www.origanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gola-1024x1024.jpg)(finger Goulash), these range in size and thickness from the size of a pinkie finger to a spring roll, and contain a wide array of fillings. Probably the most common kind of Phyllo pastry in the Middle East is [Sambousek](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/596f2f57d482e9ec36aa37e7/1557425965693-ZOSSV1GTI5EQUSOXV4A0/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kANy-8JwMkLmIeOUz4nVKkp7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UV_CumqpZqajpS1mdJHFXn0uVc9y6k_v0xei2HU8kVJYMi70pnEfxpOXPILmDs2faQ/LS_sambusek_1.jpg), however calling it a phyllo pastry is a bit of a misnomer. Depending upon the household, Sambousek can either be made with Phyllo Pastry, Spring Roll pastry, or a beautiful bubbly dough [(Check out my recipe here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlALczzeEA).\n\nLike the shape, there is also a large variation in the fillings and anything you can think of can be used in a Goulash. The most common filling in the Middle East is a minced meat and onion filling, this is lightly spiced with salt, pepper and whatever the local spice blend is. Sometimes pine nuts are added to the meat filling, however in a tray of goulash, it's usually kept to just the beef and onion. Another common filling is cooked spinach, this features very heavily in the Greek and Turkish varieties where it's usually accompanied by Feta Cheese. One filling I really enjoy is a tangy spinach filling, that is made with Sumac and Pomegranate molasses and contrasts well with the heaviness you can get from all the butter in the dish. The only restriction on the filling is that it can't contain too much liquid, as moisture can impede the cooking of the phyllo. In theory you could make a cheeseburger or chicken tandoori goulash, for the ultimate crispy snack. \n\nMaking goulash is pretty much an identical process to making a tray of Baklava, except some extra steps are taken towards the end to keep the savoury filling in place. It starts by coating a baking dish in a layer of clarified butter or oil, then laying in a single layer of phyllo pastry. That layer is then liberally coated in another layer of butter or oil, before a second layer of phyllo is added on top of it. This process called lamination is repeated over and over again until a sufficiently thick pastry base has been formed (I'd recommend a minimum of 8 layers). By laminating the pastry we are accomplishing two things; firstly we're creating a barrier between each layer that will prevent it from sticking to the ones above and below it, and secondly we are introducing fat which will crisp up the phyllo but also help it rise. Now it's important to note that clarified butter or ghee is nearly always used when making Goulash, and that's because it has had the milk solids removed and prevents the phyllo from burning. If you try to make this with regular butter you'll find it harder to work with and more susceptible to burning.\n\nOnce the base has been assembled, a pre cooked filling is added to the baking dish and distributed evenly over the pastry. This should be laid to a depth of about 1 - 1.5cm (3/8 - 5/8in) deep. When filled, a layer of phyllo is placed on top of the filling and the lamination process begins again. This time around you want to use more sheets than in the base, and the more layers you add, the higher the phyllo will rise in the oven (I find a 40:60 split works well). Before adding the last layer, it's best to trim off any excess phyllo from the dish to ensure you get a nice clean top. Once assembled the goulash has to be cut into individual servings as it's too delicate to cut when cooked, and unlike the traditional diamonds of Baklava, this is usually cut into large squares. Prior to baking the last step is to coat the entire goulash in an egg wash. Rather than serve to give the goulash a nice exterior colour, this egg wash seeps down into the filling and functions as a glue to bind the filling and phyllo layers together. The goulash is then baked until the top layers of phyllo turn completely golden brown, before being removed and allowed to cool before serving. If done right, the phyllo layers will have puffed up on the top, and the filling will be suspended in place between the top and bottom layers of pastry.\n\nIf you've worked with Phyllo pastry before then you'll know it requires patience and time to assemble this goulash. One shortcut my family does when short on time, is to use pre-rolled puff pastry sheets in place of the phyllo. Although this is definitely not an authentic version, a lot of our dinner guests have thoroughly enjoyed it and gone on to make it themselves. It's a huge time saver, because rather than laying individual sheets and laminating them, you can just place a pre rolled sheet in the dish then top it with the filling. This can either be made exactly like the Phyllo version with a top and bottom layer, or you can add a third middle layer of pastry. One draw back of doing this is that the Puff pastry will not crisp up as well as the phyllo, you sacrifice texture for time when using puff pastry. Another draw back is that the puff pastry layers in the middle and bottom will not fully expand and can have a soft squishy texture. I personally find that texture to be quite enjoyable, but to avoid it, you can roll out a single sheet of puff pastry into 2 thin layers to replace them.   \n\n## Cultural Context\nIt's not definitively known which came first, the Baklava or the Borek, however it's almost certain that it originated in either the Ottoman or Byzantine Empire. A number of sources have suggested the food is of nomadic Turkic origin, but what we do know is that this food spread far and wide in the Ottoman empire. The same Borek that's made in Bosnia and Croatia can be found in Egypt and Jordan. As the borek made its way across the Caucasus and central Asia, the fillings changed to reflect the tastes of the local cuisine, foods such as anchovies or local cheeses made their way into it. The Borek then made their way to Mongol ruled China where the recipe was recorded in a 14th century dietary book called Yinshan Zhengyao (\u98ee\u81b3\u6b63\u8981, Important Principles of Food and Drink). Borek became a huge part of Ottoman cuisine, where it was often served at court feasts and enjoyed by the regular public alike. At one point it is said there were 4 times more Borek shops in Istanbul than bakeries. [More History here](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/history-borek)  \n\nTraditionally most boreks are made with a pastry dough called yufka (similar but not identical to phyllo), however it seems that most recipes interchange yufka for filo pastry based on availability.  The use of fresh phyllo dough is important when making borek as filo can easily tear or break if it dries out. In most bakeries that make Borek, they either make the Phyllo themselves or purchase it fresh everyday from a phyllo maker. \n\nWhat's interesting about the naming of Goulash (or G\u00fclla\u00e7), is that it's also the [name of a dessert](https://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/gullac11.jpg) in some parts of the Middle East and Turkey. In Egypt, this dessert is made by soaking phyllo sheets in sweetened milk, whereas in Turkey a [thin pastry](https://turkishstylecooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gullac_yapragi3.jpg) made from flour and cornstarch is used instead.\n\n## Flavour Profile\nWith goulash, the flavour you taste will directly depend upon the filling you add to it. The classic ground meat and onion filling is usually lightly spiced and seasoned to get that classic browned beef flavour, I think it goes great with the Goulash and it's a good introduction to the versatility of this dish. However if you fill the goulash with spinach or cheese, those are what you would taste instead. One thing you may notice about goulash, is the buttery flavour you get from the laminated pastry sheets. It's more of a background flavour and the stronger your filling tastes, the less you'll notice it.\n\nRather than the flavour being important here, it's the crispy texture of the goulash that matters. You'll have three distinct layers in your goulash and should be able to feel each one as you bite into it. The bottom and top layer are both extremely crispy and firm, the texture you get from them is similar to that of potato chips but a lot more delicate and multi layered. Then you have the filling, which usually is quite soft, but depending on what you use, might have some chewiness. The contrasts between the crispy outer layers and the soft filling is what makes borek or goulash so great.\n\n## Ingredients\nThe following amounts are suitable for a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) baking dish.\n\n### Phyllo Goulash:  \n* 500g (1lb) Phyllo (Filo) pastry  \n* 250g (1/2 lb) Butter  \n\n### For Puff Pastry Goulash: \n* Half the ingredients for the beef filling  \n* 2 300g (10.5 oz) packets of pre-rolled puff pastry  \n\n### Beef filling:  \n* 1kg (2 lbs) Beef Mince  \n* 2 Medium Brown (Spanish) onions   \n* 3 Garlic cloves  \n* 2 Tbsp Olive Oil  \n* 2 Tsp Salt  \n* 1/2 Tsp Pepper  \n* 1/2 Tsp Bharat or Middle Eastern 7 spice (Optional) substitute with your favourite spice blend  \n\n### Egg wash:\n* 150ml (2/3c) whole milk  \n* 1 Large Egg or 2 Small Eggs   \n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the Beef Filling:  \n1. Dice the onions into small cubes and mince your garlic  \n2. Add Olive oil to a pan on medium-high heat and add the onions, Saute for 2-3 minutes  \n3. Once the onions have softened a little add the garlic and saute for 5 minutes until the onions turn opaque, if you would like to add some other vegetables, then add them in with the garlic  \n4. Once soft and opaque, add the Salt, Pepper & any other seasonings you would like to the onions, stir, then push to one side of the pan  \n5. Add the Minced beef to the pan and press in firmly, allow it to brown on that side for 5 minutes  \n6. Break the meat into smaller sections and flip over, allow it to fry for a few more minutes before breaking it up into tiny pieces with your spatula    \n7. Mix the onions into the meat and cook until a deep brown colour, remove and set aside    \n\n### How to clarify butter:\n1. Place your 250g stick of butter in a pot to melt on high heat until completely liquified  \n2. Allow it to come to a boil and it will foam up. Once it has boiled for a few minutes the foam will evaporate  \n3. Your clarified butter is done cooking when you can see the bottom of the pot through the golden melted butter, pour out into a jug to cool  \nNote: Make sure not to pour out any of the cooked milk solids into the jug. You will likely not use all of the clarified butter in this recipe, don't feel you have to  \n\n### How to assemble the Phyllo:\n1. Prepare a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) deep baking dish by brushing the base and walls with clarified butter  \n2. Lay your first phyllo sheet in the dish allowing any excess to run up the walls of the dish. (You may need to slice your phyllo sheets in half to fit in the dish)  \n3. Using a pastry brush, coat the sheet of phyllo from corner to corner with a thin layer of clarified butter. (You must coat all the surface including any excess pastry)  \n4. Place another Phyllo sheet on top, and press out any air bubbles. Allow it to adhere to the sheet below it. Coat it in butter once more and repeat this process until you have a minimum of 8 layers of phyllo  \n5. Using a sharp knife, trim off any excess phyllo that is running up the walls of the dish  \n6. Brush your topmost layer of phyllo with butter, then pour on your meat filling. Spread it out into one even layer from edge to edge  \n7. Place a sheet of Phyllo on top of the filling and then repeat the layering/laminating process with a minimum of 8 layers of Phyllo  \n8. When adding your last layer of Phyllo, trim any excess off the walls before placing it, then brush the top surface with butter  \n9. Using a sharp knife slice your pastry into equal sized portions, use a ruler to get accurate edges  \n10. Whisk together your milk and egg into an egg wash and then pour it evenly over the Goulash  \n11. Bake in a 180c or 350f oven for 40 minutes, rotating at the halfway point. Remove when it is Golden Brown all over and bubbling  \n12. Allow to cool for a minimum of half an hour before serving. If there is a lot of butter bubbling in the dish when it comes out of the oven DO NOT pour it out, that will cool and redistribute back into the goulash. Removing it will ruin the dish  \n\n### How to assemble the Puff Pastry Version:\n1. Prepare a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) deep baking dish by brushing the base and walls with clarified butter  \n2. Roll out one sheet of puff pastry to twice the size of your baking dish then cut in half. These will become your bottom and middle layer of pastry  \n3. Add a layer of the rolled puff pastry to the bottom of the dish and trim off any excess  \n4. Add half of your filling on top of the pastry in an even manner  \n5. Lay the second rolled layer of puff pastry on top  \n6. Add the remaining fill on top of this layer of puff pastry  \n7. Add a full sheet of puff pastry on top, then slice into equal sized portions  \n8. Whisk together your milk and egg into an egg wash and then pour it evenly over the Goulash  \n9. Bake for 40-50 minutes until the top layer puffs up well  \n10. Allow to cool for 20 minutes before eating  \n\nWhen making the puff pastry version, you only need to do about half to two thirds of the filling amount. You will also need 2 300g (10.5 oz) pre-rolled puff pastry sheets.  \nNote: The bottom two layers will not puff up, due to the weight of the layers above them and the egg wash holding everything in place.  \n\n## Ingredients\nThe following amounts are suitable for a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) baking dish.\n\n### Phyllo Goulash:  \n* 500g (1lb) Phyllo (Filo) pastry  \n* 250g (1/2 lb) Butter  \n\n### For Puff Pastry Goulash: \n* Half the ingredients for the beef filling  \n* 2 300g (10.5 oz) packets of pre-rolled puff pastry  \n\n### Beef filling:  \n* 1kg (2 lbs) Beef Mince  \n* 2 Medium Brown (Spanish) onions   \n* 3 Garlic cloves  \n* 2 Tbsp Olive Oil  \n* 2 Tsp Salt  \n* 1/2 Tsp Pepper  \n* 1/2 Tsp Bharat or Middle Eastern 7 spice (Optional) substitute with your favourite spice blend  \n\n### Egg wash:\n* 150ml (2/3c) whole milk  \n* 1 Large Egg or 2 Small Eggs   \n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the Beef Filling:  \n1.

{"title": "My thoughts after one week switching from margarine to butter", "selftext": "I made a thread about a week and a half ago, commenting that I did not understand why people hate margarine so much, I grew up with margarine mainly, and had unsalted butter I baked with, and found the unsalted butter essentially tasteless and the margarine not bad at all. They told me to go the store and get good salted butter if I wanted to understand.\n\nThe difference is ridiculous. At first it didn't seem as jarring, because the taste of butter is much more subtle than margarine and therefore did not seem to be a huge improvement at first. After 1.5 weeks of cooking, making toast, and tasting the difference, there is no way I could possibly go back. The butter tastes subtly creamy, milky, salty, and gets tastier the more I let it sit on my tongue. The eggs and toast are blatantly better tasting now, the first scrambled eggs I made with the new butter are probably the best tasting batch I ever made and they didn't even come out that well. \n\nThe margarine, on the other hand, now tastes blatantly wrong, it has a super in-your-face artificial fatty taste with no depth at all, the aftertaste is gross, everything about it just seems totally wrong. It gives me a visceral reaction now even though I was completely okay with it for decades.

Of course, all of these books are products of their time, and some contain images and stereotypes that would be too offensive to publish today.  But if you can get past the stuff that's better left behind, and look for the content that's worth bringing into this century, there's some great stuff here.\n\nA few of these books are available to download and keep as .pdf files, but most you can only borrow.  The loan period is usually one hour, but you can renew it as soon as your time runs out.  There's no charge for any of this--you just need to register for an Internet Archive account.\n\nThe books were all scanned and saved as image files--meaning that you can't just copy and paste a recipe as editable text.  You can take a screen shot of a recipe and save that, but you won't be able to edit or add to the text, and I like to have that option.  I've found a method that's getting me there, with a few extra steps:  I take a screen shot of the recipe I want, save it as a .pdf, then open it in Acrobat Pro and use the built-in OCR function to convert the image to editable text.  Depending on the font and the quality of the scan, some recipes need some cleanup, but that's still faster and more accurate than transcribing the whole recipe by hand.  I think you can do the same thing with Microsoft OneNote, but I haven't tried it.  And just to be clear:  I'm copying and converting these recipes strictly for my own use.  I'm not planning on re-publishing or selling them, or claiming them as my own creations, or suggesting that anyone else should!\n\nAnyhow, enjoy...and if you go down this rabbit hole and don't come out for weeks, at least you'll have no shortage of ideas for snacks to make while you're down there!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jpgnth/til_theres_an_online_archive_of_over_10000/", "created_utc": 1604707795.0, "score": 4489, "author": "casagordita", "num_comments": 152, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jpgnth/til_theres_an_online_archive_of_over_10000/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sometimes I just get really annoyed with diet culture and people completely cutting fat and salt from food", "selftext": "I need a little rant here, and before I start, I know some diets are doctor prescribed type things or people need to cut down on these things because of medical issues, etc. I feel like I'm in the wrong for being annoyed here, it's everyone's own choice to season how they want but seriously even a dash of salt is gonna make that dish that much better and it's not like the amount of salt you use for seasoning has a significant amount of calories. Simply putting salt in a dish isn't gonna make it salty, it's a flavour enhancer. Wish diet culture didn't target the meaningless things like this lol\n\nEdit: for clarification, the situation was that I was cooking for my family and one of them came and said I shouldn't put salt in the food. Just like I wouldn't come over to someone's place and expect them to cook a certain way, I expect the same courteousy when I'm cooking as well (except when it's for a medical reason ofc)\n\nEdit Edit: **I specifically mention in this post there are legitimate reasons to reduce/cut out salt and to repeat: I am not talking about cases like these.** This was some stupid rant about an experience particular to my situation and y'all need to listen to your doctors n nutritionists about whether your salt intake is the right amount for your situation. Lots of studies specifically talk about reducing salt because most of us over consume salt. But I think many of us can agree, diet culture takes shit and runs waaay way too far with it, so there literally are people who try to completely cut salt (who do not need to and have done so without consulting doctors etc) because some blog said it'll help you lose weight! Cutting out salt on the basis of dieting is misinformed and we should be critical of what diet culture tells us (and especially critical of the studies they use since sometimes those are funded by companies that'll benefit from the results/have already been debunked in other studies). **Finally, if you don't want salt in your food for any reason at all (health related or not), no problem--the fun thing about cooking is you can make it to your tastes. This post isn't a anti-salt hate post, but more a rant about my annoyance with people who just don't use salt because some blog said not to.**\n\nIf you're curious about what I'm meaning by diet culture: [here's an article that takes salt reduction too far](https://www.thelist.com/164105/when-you-stop-eating-salt-this-is-what-really-happens-to-your-body/). There's plenty more like this, but the subheadlines specifically state \"when you stop eating salt\" which is *not* the intent of the results from the study they cite as their evidence. True that salt reduction can have positive effects (if you're getting too much sodium) but [there are also dangers for not eating enough salt](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-dangers-of-sodium-restriction) which these clickbait-y articles also fail to recognize. We should be eating salt (as many of you said) [in moderation and according to how much our body needs](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/take-it-with-a-grain-of-salt)\n\nFinal Edit: I am seeing a lot of diet shaming which also seems to be very connected to women and dieting. Hating on women (or anybody for that matter) for simply dieting isn't okay. People diet for a variety of reasons... dieting itself isn't inherently evil. The issue is when dieting's taken to the extreme and founded in misinformation, etc. It's not inherently a women's issue and even when women are the victims of diet culture, that's not an excuse to shame them but more a reason to reevaluate what in society makes people feel like they have to go to such extremes to feel good about their body. \n\nEdit: haha thanks for the gold stranger! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/mxmbx7/sometimes_i_just_get_really_annoyed_with_diet/", "created_utc": 1619278562.0, "score": 4340, "author": "kitt-cat", "num_comments": 754, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/mxmbx7/sometimes_i_just_get_really_annoyed_with_diet/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to make your food taste DAMN good", "selftext": "Edit: If your first instinct is to instantly reply with \"MSG!\", I do mention the stuff, and about thirty people already beat you to it.\n\nPeople sometimes come here and ask \"what's the secret to good food?\" or \"how do I jazz up (insert boring meal here)?\" or \"how do I take my cooking to the next level?\" Of course there isn't just *one neat trick* to turn your food amazing, but an arsenal of techniques that you can pick from to make food taste great.\n\nThis list will overlap heavily with Salt Fat Acid Heat, because that book really does capture the fundamentals of cooking. Go buy it if you haven't already!\n\n**Salt:** Possibly the most important ingredient to master. Salt isn't a spice, it enhances flavors already there. Learn to \"salt to taste\", which is as simple as tasting something, adding salt, and tasting again. Learn to add salt during the cooking process, so your food is evenly seasoned. Even if you have to cook for people with different tolerances for salt, at least add some minimum of salt during cooking.\n\n**Fat is flavor:** Yes, fat is calories (so are carbs and proteins), but calories aren't fundamentally bad. Not only can fat provide flavor of its own, it also carries flavors and distributes heat.\n\n***Really*** **brown your meats:** Browning doesn't just mean \"cook until its not pink anymore\". Browning creates new flavors and in my opinion no spice enhances the flavor of chicken more than a good sear. Figure out the sweet spot of stove temperature and time that gives you a nice brown crust without burning.\n\n**Deglaze your Pan:** The \"brown bits\" stuck to the bottom of the pan after searing are full of flavor. Remove the food from the pan, and add a liquid (stock, broth, wine, even water in a pinch) and scrape. The brown bits will dissolve and create a super flavorful liquid. I do recommend letting the pan cool slightly before doing this or your liquid may instantly vaporize and take all its aromatic goodness with it.\n\n**Build on top of an aromatic flavor base:** This technique is so common in savory cooking that you'll almost never see a recipe that doesn't use some form of it. An aromatic flavor base is simply aromatic ingredients cooked in a fat, on top of which you build the rest of your meal. Usually the ingredients are minced or even pureed because the point is to get all of their flavor into the fat. It can be as simple as minced onions sauted in butter, or a complex blend of fresh spices and vegetables as you might find in Indian curries. Specific aromatic bases are often the foundation of a region's cuisine and you'll easily notice them if you follow enough recipes.\n\n**Add Umami for \"Bass Notes\":** The savory/umami flavor is often described as \"deep\". This taste occurs naturally in a lot of ingredients like meats, mushrooms, cheeses, and tomatos, but you can take it to the next level with umami rich ingredients like fish sauce, anchovies, tomato paste, or just plain MSG (which is *completely okay* unless you have a specific intolerance to the stuff). These ingredients are very potent so add them a little at a time (using the \"taste as you go\" technique).\n\n**Add Acid for \"High Notes\":** Acidic flavors are often described as \"bright\", and contrast well with the umami bass notes. Ingredients like citrus juices, vinegars, fruits, and wines will add an extra dimension of flavor to a dish. Of course on its own, sour is an unappealing taste and if you use too much you can ruin a dish. So use the trusty old \"taste as you go\" technique to add just enough acid to make your dish sing.\n\n**Mind your textures:** How food feels in the mouth can be just as important as its flavor. Broccoli that still has a bit of crunch tastes much better than broccoli boiled to oblivion. And no matter what doneness you like your steak, you probably like it that way because that's where the texture of the meat is *just right*. Getting the right texture is usually a matter of controlling your temperature and will take practice. For vegetables just pick one out and taste it, and decide if it's the texture you want or if it needs more time. For meats, you just have to get used to what temperatures and what times produce the results you want. With meats you'll often want to cook at two different temperatures: hot/fast and low/slow, to better arrive at the perfect destination. An instant read thermometer is a godsend for getting your meat to the right level of doneness.\n\n**Balance and Constrast your flavors:** I saved this for last because it's the most difficult to pin down. The human tongue loves contrast - both between flavors and textures. Crispy with tender, crunchy with creamy, salty with sweet, savory with sour, smoky with spicy, the list goes on. When we say a meal is \"balanced\", that often means that there's many different dimensions of flavors and texture that we can sense at the same time, with none of those components taking away from the others. To help you understand this concept, the next time you're eating a meal you really enjoy, think of all the words you could use to describe it, aside from words that just mean \"good\". Those words will reveal the contrasts and balances that make that dish great. For example, take a reuben sandwich: you have crispy and tender bread, crunchy and acidic saurkraut, sweet and creamy dressing, salty and savory corned beef, and salty and creamy swiss cheese. Or take the taco, which in its infinite variety of forms often balances the deep and savory flavor of its filling with the brighter flavors of its salsa.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dneicg/how_to_make_your_food_taste_damn_good/", "created_utc": 1572099839.0, "score": 4216, "author": "NailBat", "num_comments": 466, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/dneicg/how_to_make_your_food_taste_damn_good/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Add a bunch of fat to your white rice", "selftext": "I\u2019m Cuban American, my grandparents came here from Cuba in the 60s (for obvious reasons). One thing I feel grateful for was getting authentic Cuban cooking from my grandmother for so many years - she never measured anything, she just knew how to make it all taste right. Even the best Cuban restaurants never came close to her food. \n\nOne thing I remember is that her white rice was always so good. Good enough to eat a bowl of it on its own. It just had so much flavor, and white rice is a daily staple dish for almost all Cuban dishes. \n\nNow I\u2019ve tried so hard to replicate her white rice.

{"title": "Acidity is not a single flavor!", "selftext": "UPDATE: Did you know citrus zest isn't acidic? I've been updating [this blog post](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/all/the-types-of-acidity) with details I've learned since I posted this to reddit.\n\nChances are, you are already incorporating acidity into your cooking. But are you thoughtful about ***which*** ***type*** of acidity to use for a given dish? Because lemon doesn't work with everything.\n\nIn this post, I describe the different types of acidity and how you can incorporate each into your cooking.\n\n# What's acidity?\n\nTo chefs, acidity is control. When used judiciously, acidity can brighten a heavy or fatty dish, bring attention to subtler flavors in a dish, or add complexity. Acidity can also diminish the perception of sweetness and bitterness or decrease the salt required to balance your dish.\n\nWhen adding acids to a recipe, it\u2019s helpful to think of acidity as not a flavor but a *category* of flavors. There are different *types* of acidity, and each type has its pros and cons. Knowing which type of acidity to reach for (or knowing when to combine types of acidity to make a dish more interesting) will make your dishes more cohesive and thoughtful.\n\nSo let\u2019s walk through the types of acidity \u2014 what they are, what they\u2019re good for, and where to find them.\n\n# Citric acid\n\nWhen most people think of acidity, they think of citric acid. That\u2019s because citric acid is the primary acid in citrus fruits such as lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange, and yuzu.\n\nTo me, citric acid tastes like early morning sunshine. It\u2019s bright, it\u2019s assertive, and it can stand on its own. It is the most acidic (i.e. it is lowest on the pH scale) of the popular acids.\n\n***When to use citric acid***\n\nI prefer to use citric acid in dishes that I want to taste *fresh*. Think salads or white fish preparations. When saut\u00e9ing vegetables, for example, you might find that your vegetables taste less vibrant after you\u2019ve cooked them; a squeeze of lemon can revive those cooked vegetables \u2014 bringing out flavors that are more reminiscent of the vegetable in its raw form.\n\nCitric acid loses much of its characteristic tang with heat. You can use this to your advantage if hoping to subdue citric acid (e.g. cooking oranges with braised duck), or you can choose to add your citrus towards the end of the cooking process. The rinds of citrus tend to contain more citric acid, so don\u2019t be afraid to zest.\n\n***Where to find citric acid***\n\nIn addition to buying citrus, you can also buy pure citric acid. This can be useful when you want to incorporate the effects of citric acid without the flavors (particularly the sweetness) that come along with citrus. I often use the powder in the *leche de tigre* for my ceviche when I want more control of the acid levels. This method enables me to marinate my raw seafood in a liquid like shrimp broth instead of using just citrus juice.\n\n# Lactic acid\n\nLactic acid is the primary flavor associated with lacto-fermentation. If you\u2019ve tasted pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, or yoghurt, you\u2019ve tasted lactic acid. Even sourdough bread\u2019s acidity is due in part to lactic acid.\n\nI think of lactic acid like turning up the dimmer in your living room. It\u2019s a softer, rounder glow than citric acid \u2014 almost milky. I typically associate lactic acid with a bit of funkiness too, partially because it is usually derived from the fermentation of some other ingredient.\n\n***When to use lactic acid***\n\nI use lactic acid in dishes that need an uplifting note that is not distracting. Earthy broths or sauces seasoned with lactic acid still feel earthy but nonetheless sip lighter.\n\nI often add brightness to vegetable dishes by seasoning the vegetable with its lacto-fermented self. For example, when making celery root puree, I find that adding lemon (i.e. citric acid) is too noticeable \u2014 it doesn\u2019t belong! So I season my celery root puree with fermented celery root instead.\n\n***Where to find lactic acid***\n\nThe best way to find lactic acid is to ferment something! Lacto-fermentation is easy, and it enables you to add subtle funk to your dishes. I also like to preserve lemons in order to mellow out the citrus\u2019s citric acid with some lactic acid.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to rely on fermentation to add lactic acid to your dishes. You can also buy powdered lactic acid and incorporate it as needed. For example, I have a stash of lactic acid powder that I add to my yeasted pizza dough recipe to simulate a bit of the sourness of sourdough bread.\n\n# Acetic acid\n\nAcetic acid is the acidity you associate with vinegar or kombucha. It\u2019s also found in trace amounts in sourdough bread (alongside lactic acid) and wines (especially natty wine or those described as having \u201cvolatile acidity\u201d). Acetic acid is usually produced when alcohol is fermented in the presence of oxygen.\n\nI think of acetic acid like shining a flashlight on the heavier elements of your dish. Thanks in part to its pungent smell, it sticks out a bit, never quite mingling with the other ingredients.\n\n***When to use acetic acid***\n\nThe beauty of acetic acid is the accessibility of vinegar varieties. From rice wine vinegar to balsamic and everything in between, it\u2019s easy to find a vinegar that complements your salad or main course.\n\nMore so than other types of acidity, vinegar begs for fats to complement its sourness and tame its smell. Emulsions of vinegar and butter or olive oil serve this purpose well.\n\n***Where to find acetic acid***\n\nI don\u2019t just buy vinegars. I make them, too. Homemade vinegars (especially those made from fruits and vegetables) can have a thicker mouthfeel and sweeter taste, making them more balanced and almost a sauce on their own. The Noma Guide to Fermentation is an incredible resource for making your own vinegar.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not planning months ahead with a custom vinegar, I also like to flavor otherwise neutral vinegars (like white wine vinegar). For example, before making mushrooms, I might throw mushroom scraps in with the vinegar I plan to use the next day.\n\nMost often, I opt for an extremely strong vinegar called \u00e4ttika. From Sweden, \u00e4ttika vinegar is four times as strong as regular vinegar, so it works well when you want to adjust acidity without imparting other flavors. I have a little spray bottle with \u00e4ttika vinegar that I use to spritz a dish when I realize that it wasn\u2019t as acidic as I was hoping.\n\n# Malic acid\n\nMalic acid is the acidity in a green apple. It\u2019s also the principle acid found in apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, mirabelle plums, peaches, pears, and quince. A cheap cooking wine tastes like malic acid to me.\n\nI think of malic acid like sunshine through a stained-glass window. It\u2019s subtler than citric acid in a way that I can only describe as warm.\n\n***When to use malic acid***\n\nI find that malic acid works well to bring life to meat-centric dishes \u2014 particularly pork. It mingles well with sweetness, too, making it great for desserts.\n\nI don\u2019t use malic acid much on its own, but I do try to incorporate it into dishes that are already acidic to add more complexity. A sauce with multiple types of acidity can taste like a whole fruit basket! For example, I often add both white wine and vinegar to butter sauces (i.e. I mix malic acid with acetic acid). Fermenting blackberries, similarly, is a means to add lactic acid to malic-rich berries.\n\n***Where to find malic acid***\n\nI keep some reduced white wine handy to adjust the malic acidity in dishes. Otherwise, I keep powdered malic acid on hand to adjust the liquids I use in my ceviche.\n\n# Other acids\n\nThe four acids I\u2019ve described only scratch the surface. But the other acids don\u2019t have as many culinary uses.\n\nOxalic acid (found in wood sorrel, chives, and purslane) certainly comes in handy (and is reminiscent of acetic acid), but excessive consumption of oxalic acid can be toxic. Tartaric acid plays an important role in lowering the pH in wine production, and it\u2019s mixed with baking soda to become baking powder. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid is common too \u2014 because it's vitamin C!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHope this was helpful. And when life gives you lemons, be sure to think twice about whether that\u2019s the acidity life really needs right now.\n\nEdit: A couple folks asked about the blog where I post similar thoughts on food.

{"title": "Marshmallow Mania and the Cult of 240F.", "selftext": "Big Mallow is a cabal that's been spreading disinformation. 240F is a big, fat, arbitrary lie. \n\n(**tl;dr:** Marshmallow Mania hit me, and I spent 20+ hours making marshmallows. My findings suggest that the texture of marshmallows is dependent on the sum total proportions of the marshmallow ingredients, not the degree of sugar syrup heating. 240F is an arbitrary syrup temperature, and is used across the board for relatively similar ingredient proportions.)\n\nA short time ago, I was developing my \"egg yolk-based marshmallow\"/marshyellow recipe (still needs a bit of tweaking). I was doing some research, and noticed something kind of...odd about the information regarding a specific step.\n\n[Here's the Wikipedia entry for making marshmallows that gave me pause, courtesy of Chocolates and confections: Formula, theory, and technique for the artisan confectioner:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow#Home_making_process)\n\nAnything jump out at you? No? That might be because you haven't read a variety of marshmallow recipes.\n\n- [Here's a recipe (allegedly) from America's Test Kitchen:] (https://www.thefrugalgirl.com/how-to-make-homemade-marshmallows)\n\n- [New York Times Cooking:](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019101-marshmallows)\n\n- [Serious Eats:] (https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/classic-marshmallows-recipe.html)\n\n- [Epicurious:] (https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/homemade-marshmallows-242701)\n\n- [Alton Brown:](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/homemade-marshmallows-recipe-1953933)\n\n- [Martha Stewart:](https://www.marthastewart.com/333974/homemade-marshmallows)\n\n- [Francisco freakin' Migoya:](https://www.saint-honore.me/blog/marshmallows)\n\n- [Bruno Albouze, the one outlier:](https://brunoalbouze.com/recipe/marshmallow/)\n\nBruno aside, they ALL place marshmallows at 238F-240F. I've seen a lot of marshmallow recipes in my time, and I've NEVER seen Wikipedia's method of 227F. (And I was so confused by Bruno's recipe...265F was way higher than any I'd seen. But we'll come back to this.) \n\nWait, it gets even more confusing.\n\n- [Now, here's a chart about sugar syrups:](https://www.thermoworks.com/pdf/candy_temperature_chart.pdf) Note the location of marshmallows in their chart.\n\n- [Cook's Info on where 'mallows belong:](https://www.cooksinfo.com/hard-ball-stage)\n\n- [LorAnnOils:](https://www.lorannoils.com/sugar-science) They place marshmallows in the firm-ball stage.\n\nMy confusion kept growing with every article I read. Everyone's telling me something different. Recipes that call for soft-ball! No, proclaim the sugar syrup stages, firm-ball or hard-ball! And for some reason, Wikipedia's telling me the THREAD stage is what you want. This was perturbing; if baking is a science, my impression of candy making is that of analytical chemistry. It's precise, exact, and demands strict adherence to the recipe beyond what baking asks and cajoles. I was under the impression that the sugar syrup's concentration is critical to somehow correctly forming marshmallows. So what's going on here? Why's everyone using the same temperature in their recipes, despite background info to the contrary?\n\nClearly, there's a conspiracy being perpetrated by Big Mallow. They're trying to keep us in the dark, to prevent us from tinkering with marshmallow recipes.\n\n[So I...um...made a ton of marshmallows to figure this out.](https://i.imgur.com/eEIm5Zh.jpg) (pictured: about 2/3 of every batch I made, along with some marshyellow variants) Marshmallow Mania reigned supreme, and I spent an ungodly amount of time making them for both this experiment, and for my marshyellow recipe improvement. I'll also note that I had to eat an ungodly number of the stupid clouds of sugar and fluff, and would gladly never consume another so long as I draw breath. \n\nFirst, to determine if you can make marshmallows at all of the claimed stages. [I checked my thermometer in a pot of boiling water to ensure accurate readings.](https://i.imgur.com/6lCYAGx.jpg) Then I made batches of marshmallows at varying sugar syrup temperatures.\n\nHere's my recipe and methodology (base recipe is based on a scaled-down version of Migoya's 'mallows):\n\n8g powdered gelatin\n\n47g cold water\n\n110g granulated, white sugar\n\n120g corn syrup\n\n50g water\n\n3g salt\n\n~2.5mL vanilla extract\n\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, bloom the gelatin in the cold water. Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan. Heat to (VARIABLE) temperature, and slowly add to bloomed gelatin, while whipping on medium-low speed. Turn mixer speed to max, and whip for exactly five minutes, adding the salt and vanilla halfway through. Using a greased spatula, scoop as much batter as possible into a greased pan, and use a greased offset spatula to smooth the top. Let sit for a minimum of 8 hours to cure, then cut into cubes and coat in an equal mixture (w/w) of cornstarch and powdered sugar.\n\nBetween each batch, I scrupulously cleaned all utensils with hot water to avoid sugar crystal residue.\n\n[Left-to-right: 225F. 230F, 240F, 245F, 250F, 262F](https://i.imgur.com/zuWrS02.jpg)\n\n\nAfter coating, the marshmallows were stored at room temperature in ziploc bags to maintain freshness/moisture contents.\n\nThe most apparent conclusion is that, yes, you can ABSOLUTELY make marshmallows at varying sugar syrup stages. Well, in a sense. They're all \"marshmallows\", in the sense that they're masses of aerated, gelatinized sugar blobs. I'm sure plenty of people have their own personal textural notions of what a \"marshmallow\" should be. But here are the differences:\n\nVolume: Due to what I imagine is increased viscosity (due to decreased water concentrations of the syrup), the volume of batter decreases proportionally to elevated sugar temps. [Here, you can see the two extremes, 225F vs 262F.](https://i.imgur.com/TNatXf9.jpg)\n\nWeight: The lower temps allowed for increased aeration, which resulted in larger yields of 'mallow, and there's a downward trend corresponding to total batch weights and increased syrup temps. (225F->262F respectively, 249g, 242g, 222g, 211g, 203g, 165g)\n\nTexture: The higher the syrup temp, the chewier and more \"taffy-like\" the marshmallow. Charybdis, my poor stand mixer, had a tough time whipping the 262F, that stuff was t h i c c. In contrast, the 225F melts in your mouth, with barely any chew. Far more pillowy, jiggly, etc.\n\nCaramelization: The lower the syrup temp, the higher the final moisture content. [Held 10cm away from a torch, I noticed that it took slightly longer to caramelize the lower temp marshmallows](https://i.imgur.com/6ClOdSK.jpg). I wonder if there's also an aeration-based insulation factor at work (given the apparent increase in aeration in the lower-temp syrups).\n\nSo now I knew you can make marshmallows at most sugar syrup stages (I haven't tried soft-crack and upwards, I fear for my stand mixer's health after the 262F). Then I had a thought: what if the sugar syrup was a function of achieving a specific texture?\n \nEnter the final experiment. Let's take the taffymallows of 262F and see if we can turn them into 230F squishmallows. At 262F, the sugar concentration is ~92%, and at 230F, it's ~80%. I calculated the amount of water lost at 262F, and added an amount of water to the gelatin that would correspond to the concentration at 230F. I figured it's easier to work \"backwards\", ie, make a higher temp identical to a lower temp. Going \"forwards\" might create an issue where reducing the water added to the gelatin leads to insufficient bloom. I don't thiiink you can \"over-bloom\" gelatin, so I doubt the reverse is true.\n\nWell. [Here's the faux-230F with the real 230F:](https://i.imgur.com/nOK0Zcp.jpg): \n\n[Compare the volume difference of the [faux-230F](https://imgur.com/a/D8E6dBA) to the [262F and the 225F](https://i.imgur.com/TNatXf9.jpg). By visual inspection, they were about double in volume to the original 262F! **And the texture was near-identical in nature to the 230F.** The former were ever-so-slightly softer and \"meltier\", but they were also made a day or so after the latter, and I'm convinced that this accounts for the minor discrepancy. The final batch weights were identical too, suggesting similar aeration percentages. \n\n(Note: The fact that they're *identical* is a happy coincidence. There will be minor discrepancies due to unequal scooping of the batter into the pans, as well as additional mass from the sugar/cornstarch mixture. I cut all the batches into similar size cubes, so the surface areas would be similar, and they'd pick up similar quantities of the mixture.)\n\nSuddenly, Bruno's aberrant 265F temperature made sense. His recipe uses egg whites in addition to gelatin, and egg whites are ~90% water. He heats his syrup to a much higher stage to compensate for the additional moisture content. I imagine that if you followed his recipe to a T, but stuck with good ol' 240F, the marshmallows would barely have much structure, and would be closer to the 225F squishmallows than what you'd typically want out of a marshmallow.\n\nI did a repeat experiment with a different final hydration stage: 262F to 240F. The results were the same as before: I compared the product to my 262F and 240F marshmallows, and again, the faux-240F were no different than the real 240F (save, again, for a near-imperceptible difference for the same given reason as before).\n\nNow, I refuse to say \"I conclude X to be true\", because my experiment isn't rigorous in the least. I didn't repeat each step numerous times, testing every possible extreme, I didn't test every potential example, etc. I would, but I think I'd go nuts, as I'd have an issue juggling this with my full-time job and other hobbies. I also nearly ran out of my 1lb tub of gelatin. So I'm going to leave it as \"the data *suggests* that...\"\n\nBut the general idea this all suggests - aside from me being crazy - is that you can alter marshmallow recipes to achieve a texture *you* prefer simply by changing either the syrup temperature, or the gelatin hydration. If you found a nice recipe for egg white marshmallows, but find them too soft for your liking, you can decrease the gelatin hydration within reason, and/or increase the sugar syrup temperature by some amount to make them chewier and more stable. If you don't mind the bit of math, you use this info to take more control of the marshmallow process.\n\nI'm still not sure why people so unanimously use 240F as their temperature. I can imagine a scenario where Head Chef tells their underlings \"Heat it to 240F, because [something something reasonable-yet-incorrect explanation]\", and everyone follows HC's lead and reasoning. They move up the ranks, and proliferate HC's recipes, and if challenged about the reasoning, refer to HC's expertise to bolster their claims. [Look how many differing explanations people have about brownie skin/crust formation:]( https://youtu.be/FuO1kzpKtEU?t=639) It's easier to pull from your combined experience and instinct, and offer up a reasonable explanation, than to rigorously experiment your way to the answer. Or maybe there's actually a cult, I dunno.\n\nBut anyhow, thus concludes the week of the marshmallow. Please subject to peer review if you're also marshmallow-obsessed. I'd love additional insights and data!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lckowv/marshmallow_mania_and_the_cult_of_240f/", "created_utc": 1612459132.0, "score": 4036, "author": "Fluffy_Munchkin", "num_comments": 283, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/lckowv/marshmallow_mania_and_the_cult_of_240f/", "html_title": ""}

This requires a special time of the year (now is great, atleast in the Netherlands). My pines are from the Pinus Sylvestrus.\n\nstep 2. Cut off the stem of the pine cones. I used scissors to cut the woody part where they are attached to the branch.\n\nstep 3. preboil them in water for 15 minuts to clean them off and to get rid of the harder resins. These resins may cause a bitter taste.\n\nstep 4. simmer them for two hours in a simple sirup. ive added honey (fructose) to it, so that the sirup wont cristalize too much from the sugar (sucrose). Also added a tiny bit of vanilla sugar (optional).\n\nstep 5. let it cool for atleast 12 hours, then simmer the mixture again for 20 minuts. you can see a beautiful brown reddish colour appear in the syrup. the taste of the syrup is already phenomenal!\n\nstep 6. repeat step 5 atleast 3 times. i still havent figured out why this is necessary and how many times i should do this. love some advice on that.\n\nstep 7. simmer out all the moist and find your right sirup consistency. do note that the sirup gets thicker when it cools down.\n\nThis recipe requires time, thus patience. I believe the longer that the cones rest in the syrup mixture, the better. I have also read something about osmosis, replacing moist with sugar, which requires time. please educate me on that as well in the context of my pine cones. I hope to get totally rid of the slightly bitter taste of the cones and the light woody texture over time.\n\nHere is a picture of the [end result](https://ibb.co/gP0vNSz).\nand [here ](https://ibb.co/ZXrbm66) some more.\nI can tell you, theyre soo fascinating!\nSpecial thanks to everyone who has reached out to me for help!

Add your own seasonings, frozen vegs, frozen dumplings, eggs, etc\n* Eggs. Tofu egg (smash tofu, add to egg, fry), fried egg, scrambled egg, boiled egg, frozen vegs egg, all eggs.\n* Rice cooker meal. You can add other meat/vegs too in the rice\n   * Rich rice: Milk, butter, rice, dried herbs.\n   * \"Fried rice\": Soy sauce, sesame oil, water, rice.\n   * Risotto rice: Stocks, water\n\nLevel 3 (I can do small/urgent tasks)\n\n* Soup. Throw any vegs/meats you have, add stock powder/msg. Herbs would make it better but not adding any will still taste good. Adding dried pasta would bulk it up\n* Canned fish/meat. You can bulk it up by adding vegetables, sauces, or even instant cream soup. Eat with rice/pasta/bread\n* Pancake. Just make normal batter as usual, but if I have energy for it, I'll make extra so I can freeze it up\n* Tomato egg. Cook scrambled eggs, set aside, cook tomato with ketchup, add the egg back in. Done. You can also add baked beans to it\n\nLevel 2 (I'm just feeling the blues, nothing too bad. Function almost as well as normal)\n\n* Pasta dishes, like napoleon, carbonara, or even macaroni soup. Saucy pasta is easy but a bit messy IMO\n* Proteins like chicken, meatballs, stir fry beef, etc. Handling meat is also quite messy, so I don't make it a lot except if I can handle the cleanup\n* Fried rice. Soy sauce fried rice, golden fried rice, kimchi fried rice\n\nLevel 1 (Happy, upbeat, full of energy)\n\nJust cook as normal. There's no special recipe here.

As usual if you'd like to support me or prefer video guides, here's the link to the [recipe and technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjkkapeCX4). I've also linked to all my past r/cooking posts in the comments below.\n\nThe sight of a [Shawarma spit rotating slowly while grilling](https://i.imgur.com/1yFDzj7.mp4) is breathtaking and majestic. The meat slowly bubbles and fries up on the exterior, while melted fat and juices trickle down the assembled shawarma cone. Then like a trained violinist, the shawarma meister [shaves the exterior of the cone](https://imgur.com/vFVa5NV) into thin strips of grilled meat before wrapping it in some flatbread. It is a true site to behold, and the experience of eating shawarma that was shaved seconds before is one you'll likely never forget. So what is one to do when you have no shawarma shops nearby and the craving strikes. Well the answer is to make your own but the problem with that is it's near impossible to get the correct grilled flavor and texture without a rotisserie, that is until today. I'm going to show you how to make the best homemade chicken shawarma of your life, using a technique that I developed that requires no special equipment (except some skewers) and can be done in any grill or broiler equipped oven.\n\n## What is Chicken Shawarma\nShawarma is the name given in the Middle East to a dish of layered meat which is grilled on a rotating spit, it commonly comes in two forms; Chicken or Meat (either beef, lamb or a mix of both). It's served throughout the middle east with every country putting their own unique twist on the marinades and sauces that are used. For the most part shawarma is eaten [as a sandwich](https://cdn.nogarlicnoonions.com/images/thumbs/image.php/image_05dba4cfe056d8950714190f6deaeef1.jpg?width=2000&height=2000&image=/images/articles/2019-01/main2019-01-06-09-57-05.jpg), but it's also sometimes [served with rice](https://syriankitchensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lamb-shawarma-plate.jpg), [on hummus](https://www.tasteofbeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/copy-hummus-wmeat.jpg) or with a salad. The popularity of shawarma and it's appeal as a quick delicious street food has lead to it spreading all over the world particularly as a late night meal.  \n\nThere are a number of international variants of shawarma such as Turkish D\u00f6ner (this is actually the historical origin of shawarma), Greek Gyros, and Mexican Al pastor (invented by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico), though today we will be focusing only on Levantine (specifically Syrian and Lebanese) style Chicken Shawarma sandwiches. These sandwiches are put together using the freshly shaved chicken, Toum (Thick garlic sauce, see my last post for this, link in notes), salty pickled cucumbers and Shatta (Chilli sauce, also in my last post), all wrapped together in a [thin stretchy flatbread called Saj](https://ak.picdn.net/offset/photos/5500868c5a10fc50d2d059e6/medium/offset_196904.jpg). Some people opt to add in slices of Tomato, lettuce, French fries or potato chips (crisps) for additional flavors or textures, but I feel it's unnecessary and the shawarma sandwich can shine without them. Once wrapped in the bread, the sandwich is toasted on a panini press for a minute, to crisp up the exterior of the bread and seal the sandwich shut.   \n\nThe issue with cooking chicken shawarma at home is that it's really hard to get the right texture without the assistance of a [rotisserie](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6udm3n_Nr8G1sla6qb7ZnXGb4Mb1V_uvSqTPv0iGwKUcNPOYUl628JrfEDdH_kQ8RRA3AWzmNIXH5tskfK2-mRShHBQwTRIMV_Ack2L0VwIK0YmQpa2F4PWL7HD7jO1MS6DztIgEzl3RPdj-0uI). As the rotisserie spins, the meat cooks from the outside inwards, and attains a glossy grilled char on the outer surface. Once shaved you'll end up with pieces that on one side are perfectly juicy and tender soft meat, and on the other side are crisped and lightly charred with an amazing grilled flavor. That texture is essential for correctly made chicken shawarma, and unfortunately it's really difficult to get using most home cooking methods. Although the marinade adds the majority of the flavor to the dish, it won't taste or feel right without the grilled exterior.  \n\nThe simplest method to use for home cooked shawarma is to cut your marinated chicken into strips and then pan fry them. It works in a pinch and will give you chicken strips that taste similar to shawarma, but I've found that this method doesn't give you any resemblance in terms of texture and crucially the meat is missing a charred/grilled flavor. Another method that is quite simple, is to grill whole chicken thighs or breast fillets (slices about 1 cm thick) in a griddle or grill pan, then slicing it into strips before serving. This will give you a better texture and some char, and is my preferred method if I'm in a rush. However the texture is still quite different from that of genuine shawarma and the reason for that lies in the direct contact the chicken pieces will have with the pan. It will cause the meat to cook a lot quicker on the outside than it will on the inside, so you'll end up with a larger variation of doneness across a cross section of the meat.  \n\nOne strange technique I've seen a lot recently, involves [stacking your whole chicken pieces](https://img.buzzfeed.com/tasty-app-user-assets-prod-us-east-1/tips/7528a357206249b3b667eebb0badf2a8.jpeg?output-quality=auto&resize=800:*) on some skewers, and baking it upright in the oven. Although this might look closer to a traditional shawarma cone, it's absolutely illogical, as you have to bake the whole thing until cooked through to the center. Although well intentioned, this method will basically give you over done and dry outer edges with some browning, and a well cooked center with 0 color. So what can you do to get realistic shawarma at home?   \n\nMy technique is designed to grilling steak in a restaurant setting, to ensure that we get a perfectly cooked center in our meat, while still ensuring we get a crispy grilled outside. We will use the grill or broiler function to obtain a nice crust and grilled flavor. First the marinated chicken is sliced into thin strips about 1/2cm or 1/4in thick, then its suspended between two skewers. The filled skewers are placed on the edge of a baking tray or dish so that the meat is suspended in mid air and isn't touching the base. The tray is then placed under the broiler or grill in the oven to cook and is rotated every few minutes until lightly charred and cooked through. This is the best technique I have found for cooking chicken shawarma at home, and it really does mimic that of rotisserie shawarma. The direct heat from the grill or broiler allows you to develop char and crispiness, without the meat constricting and shrinking as it would in a pan.  \n\n## History\nThe origins of Shawarma is one of many stories and timelines, and has been claimed by many nations. The name Shawarma may have come from the Turkish word \u00e7evirme, which some sources say means turning, though my google-fu has said it means translation (technically this still is a form of movement). But all indicators do point to this being an ottoman food, and that's mainly due to its importance and stature in the countries that make up the former ottoman empire. One very important clue on its ottoman origins was discovered [in the background of a painting](https://images.culinarybackstreets.com/wp-content/uploads/cb_istanbul_bookclub_bountifulempire_doner_shahnama-363x450.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1) from 1616 which the food historian [Priscilla Mary I\u015f\u0131n](https://culinarybackstreets.com/cities-category/istanbul/2018/cb-book-club-11/) discovered and wrote about in her book 'Bountiful Empire: A History of Ottoman Cuisine'. It dates the rotation method of cooking kebab to at least the 17th century.\n\nShawarma is thought to have first gone vertical through the work of Iskender Efendi in the 19th century (1867 to be exact) in the city of Bursa. He is also the inventor of the [Iskender Kebab](https://www.tourmakerturkey.com/uploads/8/7/4/4/8744530/6423069_orig.jpeg), which consists of meat shawarma placed on a bed of bread, then topped with a tomato sauce, browned butter and yoghurt. His descendants still run a restaurant in the city of Bursa to this day. Speaking of vertical shawarma, nearly all shawarma is now cooked vertically, but over the past decade there has been a resurgence in horizontally cooked shawarma. This is usually done over [a coal fire pit](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://karasshawarma.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/karas-shawarma-1.jpg) and is honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten.\n\nThe spread of shawarma through the rest of the middle east is not clear and there aren't any credible stories of how it got transformed into a sandwich nor how it came to be combined with Toum and Shatta. However given that Toum is very much a Levantine invention and is a main component of chicken shawarma sandwiches, it's likely that it spread from either Syria or Lebanon. One clue to the Syrian origins of Chicken shawarma sandwiches also lies in the stores that sell shawarma throughout the Arab world. One of the oldest shawarma stores in Egypt is called Abo Ammar El Sory, which literally means Ammar's Father - The Syrian. There are also lots of other Syrian joints that specialize in shawarma throughout Cairo, though I'm unsure if this is just a phenomenon in Egypt.  \n\nOne thing that we can say for sure is that Shawarma has spread throughout the world over recent years, and this is mostly attributed to the rise in Syrian refugees opening restaurants in the countries they now call home. London, UK is home to dozens of these, some of which put out shawarma that can rival any I've had in the Middle East. Europe has been a hotbed for Turkish Doner Kebabs for a long time, but the shawarma sandwich is now posing a new challenge to their dominance.\n\n## Flavor Profile\n\nThe chicken shawarma itself has a mild but complex spiced flavor due to the varied amounts of spices in it. You can easily pick up the flavors of Bay, cloves, cardamom and turmeric. The paprika and tomato paste add some depth to the shawarma and much needed umaminess. Adding lemon and vinegar to the marinade give it acidity but at the same time they serve to tenderize the chicken in conjunction with the yoghurt. Once cooked the flavors in the marinade mellow down slightly and you also get the grilled flavor coming through. Finally the great thing about cooking the shawarma with this method, is that you are still able to taste the chicken itself.\n\nAs a sandwich, it has quite a great and well rounded flavor. The first flavor you notice is the grilled bread, which I think is a step that gets left out too often. The freshly baked flavor you get from toasting it is essential to the shawarma experience. The next thing that cuts through is the garlic sauce, with its strong and pungent garlic flavor. You then get the flavors of the chicken mixed with the salt and sourness of the pickles. It's very much a memorable experience eating real shawarma for the first time as the flavors all blend together so well. If you add some chilli sauce as well then you will get a background heat in your sandwich that is really pleasant.  \n\n## Ingredients\n\n### For the Chicken Shawarma:\n* 1kg (2lbs) Boneless skinless chicken thighs\n* 4-6 Garlic cloves\n* 4 Bay Leaves\n* 1 Cup of Yoghurt\n* 4 Tbsp tomato paste\n* 3 Tbsp Lemon Juice\n* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 1 Tbsp White Vinegar\n* 2 Tsp Salt\n* 1 Tsp Ground Cumin\n* 1 Tsp Garlic Powder\n* 1 Tsp Boharat\n* 1 Tsp Onion Powder\n* 1/2 Tsp Chilli Flakes\n* 1/2 Tsp Ground Coriander\n* 1/2 Tsp Cinnamon\n* 1/2 Tsp Smoked Paprika\n* 1/2 Tsp Turmeric\n* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper\n* 1/2 Tsp Ground Ginger\n* 1/2 Tsp Cloves\n* 1/4 Tsp Nutmeg\n* 1/4 Tsp Ground Cardamom \n\n### Sandwich Ingredients:\n* Saj bread if you can find it, Lavash or Lebanese bread if you cannot\n* Salty Lebanese pickled cucumbers or if you can't find it then get salty cornichons\n* Toum sauce (recipe in my last post, link in the comments)\n* Chilli sauce (recipe in my last post, link in the comments)\n\n## Directions\n\n### Marinade directions:\n1. Butterfly or pound your chicken thighs until they are 1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick, even thickness is crucial for a great cook. If you are using chicken breasts then butterfly them and then pound to an even thickness\n2. Crush your bay leaves using a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder (you can use some of the salt to help with this), then add to a bowl with the remaining spices\n3. Mince your garlic and mix with the Yoghurt, Tomato Paste, Lemon Juice, Olive oil, white vinegar and the spice mix. Stir until well mixed and then add your chicken in to the bowl and mix to ensure each piece is well coated in the marinade\n4. Place your chicken in the fridge for a minimum of 12 hours so the marinade can really take effect\n\n### My oven grilled/broiled chicken shawarma technique:\nI highly recommend checking out my video for this as the steps are kind of hard to translate into words  \n\n1. Slice your marinated chicken thighs into strips about 1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick\n2. Using a skewer, pierce your chicken strips all along one side and slide them onto the skewer until the entire chicken thigh has been threaded on to the skewer\n3. With a second skewer, pierce the opposite end of the chicken, so that the chicken strips are suspended between both skewers, it will kind of resemble crochet. Push the thigh together so it's slightly compressed then repeat until you have filled all your skewers. Leave about an inch clear on both tips of the skewer.\n4. Line a deep baking sheet with foil or dish with foil, then place the skewers across the edge of the sheet. Either end of the skewer should be resting on opposing walls of the baking sheet, with the meat suspended between them, floating above the sheet not sitting in it (you may need to use a deep baking dish if your trays are shallow).\n5. Place your tray in the oven with your grill or broiler set to medium and cook for 3-5 minutes. Rotate the skewers to the second side and cook for another 3-5 minutes. Place them back in the over for 2-3 more minutes until slightly charred. Cooking times will really vary with each broiler or grill, but you should basically flip when it starts to develop a sear then flip when it happens on the other side. Your chicken should read 74c or 165f when done. If your broiler or grill only has one strength setting, try rotating it more often such as every minute. \n\n### Pan Grilled directions:\n1. Heat a grill pan or griddle and place a few chicken thighs in it, but don't overcrowd the pan\n2. Cook them on medium high heat, flipping them every 2-3 minutes until cooked through, this should only take a few minutes\n3. Remove and let cool slightly before slicing into thin strips\n\n### To make a shawarma sandwich:\n1. Place a piece of bread on your work surface and slather on a couple of tablespoons of Toum \n2. Add your chicken pieces on top, as well as some pieces of sliced cucumber pickle\n3. Add some chilli sauce to the sandwich then roll it up and seal\n4. Place your sandwiches in a grill pan of griddle, and weigh them down with something heavy. Allow them to sear for 30-60 seconds per side until grill marks form. You may find that wrapping the sandwiches in greaseproof paper before grilling helps keep them from splitting open.\n\n## Notes and tips\n* This recipe is specifically for CHICKEN shawarma and the marinade for meat shawarma is completely different, it probably wont taste right if you do this with meat instead\n* You can use Chicken breast instead of chicken thigh, or even a mix of both if you are doing a large quantity. The best way to do this would be to alternate strips of thigh and breast for a well mixed texture\n* I really recommend using metal skewers, but if you can't find them then regular bamboo or wooden ones will do fine, just be aware that they can burn under the grill\n* Play around with the strength of the marinade a bit, the spice blend is great but you might find that you like it a bit weaker or stronger. Try halving the spices or doubling it to suit your taste. The rest of the marinade ingredients should remain the same though\n* If you really wanted to go wild, I'd highly recommend grilling the shawarma on a charcoal grill. The flavor will be insane and honestly coal fired shawarma is so much better, you will thank me for this\n* The recipe for the Toum and Shatta (Garlic and chilli sauces) is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/j6prab/toum_is_an_insanely_fluffy_garlic_sauce_that/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jbrth8/the_homemade_chicken_shawarma_manual_a_guide_to/", "created_utc": 1602782062.0, "score": 3918, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 269, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jbrth8/the_homemade_chicken_shawarma_manual_a_guide_to/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Since I moved out, my mom and I have been hosting a cooking show for each other.", "selftext": "Since I moved out of my parents' house a bit more than a year ago, I have obviously started having to cook for myself. Luckily for me, they gave me a love of cooking, and at least a general knowledge of how to cook for myself. Most weeks I make something that makes good leftovers, and those become lunches for me for the week at work. This isn't about that though.\n\nThe thing is, I moved from New Jersey to Colorado. It's not a quick drive to visit home and my parents, it's a four hour flight. I don't get to see them very often, at least not in person. I miss sharing a fresh home cooked meal with my family every night, and coming home to an empty apartment after work gets tough after a while. The age of instant communication through phone and text helps, but its still hard. So, among other things I did last time I visited home, I gave my mom a cookbook. It had some interesting recipes, and we decided that we would cook one of them, together, over Zoom, 1600 miles apart. That was back in June, and tonight we are going to make a baked ziti together. We have been doing this about every other week, one of us picks a dish, we find or make up a recipe, and we cook it and chat for a few hours. It has become one of the highlights of my weeks, and for those of you that can and want to do something like this, I strongly recommend doing this with your loved ones.\n\nAs is implied by the title, we call it our cooking show.

Stew is delicious, but its not that fun to sit and wait for it to cook for hours staring at each other.\n\nEdit to add [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/H47nSTM) of how my ziti came out.

{"title": "The Dangers Of Having Corn Allergy In America", "selftext": "I am putting this here because the impossible to replace thread got me thinking.\n\nFor most of my adult life I have suffered from an extreme case of psoriasis. Not just those little patches on the knees and elbows, mind you, but head to toe complete body coverage. It was so bad that I was seen personally by the head of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Psoriasis Division and, after about a year of seeing him I jokingly asked him if I was was worst case he\u2019s ever seen. He looked at me and said with a wink, \u201cWorst case? Nah....Top 5, maybe.\u201d\n\nAnyway, in the process of trying to discover a, well not a cure, but a relief, I began eliminating different types of food from my diet, different types of meats, different veggies, etc. Nothing worked.\n\nThen one day, an assistant suggested that I attempt a gluten free diet to see if that would help.\n\nNow living in the Southwest U.S., there\u2019s simple solution to gluten as far as things like bread is concerned, cornmeal.\n\nAlso, along this journey, although I enjoyed cooking prior, it became necessary for me to do so to control what I ate so the experiment could take place. So, although not yet fully capable in the kitchen, it forced me to gain a rather simple adequacy just so I wasn\u2019t eating the same thing everyday.\n\nSo I began searching for recipes that avoided any type of gluten in them, and most of them included some form of corn in them.\n\nIn the subsequent week my body began exploding with a reaction I had never had before. \n\nDespite being on heavy, and I do mean HEAVY, medication that had tamped down my symptoms to a livable level, I experienced my the worst outbreak of my life.\n\nI remember at the end of the week driving into the Doctors office for an emergency appointment because it was so bad, and going over in my mind about everything I had done the previous week, where I had gone, what I had done, etc., and it hit me like a bolt of lightening out of the blue, I had eaten more corn in the last week than I ever had before.\n\nSo, when the visit was over, after we had discussed it, I came home and vowed to not touch anything with corn in it as a new experiment.\n\nNow, looking back on it, I had always done things that I should have put 2 and 2 together. For instance, despite how tasty they are, I could never eat more than a handful of Fritos, the snack bag always left half full at the end of the meal. Or I just couldn\u2019t drink American whiskey, I would always begin getting a hangover WHILE I was drinking it.\n\nLiterally within 2 days, my body began healing, medications that had not worked before, and believe me, I had a counter full of them, suddenly started working the way they were intended.\n\nBy 2 weeks, my body was as clear as it had been in years. Not to say it was totally clear, mind you, but it was certainly better than the days when I would have to soak in a bathtub for an hour, then coat myself in Vasoline just to be able to go to the store to pick up food. Yes, it was that bad.\n\nSo, as I began going through my shelves looking for anything that had corn in it, I began to toss almost everything I had, because there was some form of corn in it, whether it be a sweetener, or thickener, or even jut a filler, almost everything had some form of corn in it.\n\nAnd what I didn\u2019t know at the time, but later found out, is that most of what I kept, still had some form of corn in it, even if it was thought of as a basic ingredient or not listed.\n\nCorn is so ubiquitous in this society that even if you think you\u2019re avoiding it, you\u2019re not, you can\u2019t, it\u2019s nigh on impossible because it\u2019s in everything.\n\nSo now I cannot \u201cGo out to eat\u201d with friends.\n\nI always get the comment, \u201cYou can just have a salad\u201d. No I can\u2019t, because the salad dressing itself usually has some type of corn or corn byproduct in it.\n\nSo now, the only thing I have when I go out is water, basic water.\n\nAnd although I know that\u2019s unusual, if you had lived through what I lived through, you wouldn\u2019t do it any different.\n\nAs a result, even family gatherings are a struggle unless I am the cook because even though she tries hard to get things that don\u2019t have corn in it, inevitably my mother misses something crucial and makes a meal that ends up with a corn product in it.\n\nSo no processed foods, no soft drinks, no fast food, no restaurants, no nothing unless I cook it myself.\n\nAnd while the anti-HFCS is trending across the country, read the label, there just might be Corn Syrup itself in the product. I remember the first time I saw a bottle of some sauce that proudly displayed that it had no High Fructose Corn Syrup in it, and when I flipped it over to look at the ingredients, the second ingredient was, in fact, Corn Syrup.\n\nSo manufactures are trying to sell the idea, because that\u2019s what people are asking for now, but since corn is usually the cheapest option, that\u2019s what they end up going with, despite their proud declarations.\n\nBut all that comes to this, although I cannot have corn, that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have the ingredients, or the products, I just have to go outside America to find them.\n\nFor example, for years now, I have been using a simple mixture of Cream of Tartar and baking soda to create a substitute for baking powder, since almost all available baking powder is made here in America, with 1/3 baking soda and 2/3 cornstarch. But a few weeks ago, I was trying to figure out why the biscuits I was making were never the light and fluffy ones everyone is used to, they always seemed to fall flat in the oven instead of rising, despite my using the exact same ingredients, but only substituting the Cream of Tarter mix for the baking powder.\n\nTurns out, despite the ingredient list, there\u2019s a lot more going on with baking powder, or double acting baking powder, than first thought.\n\nIt\u2019s not just sodium bicarbonate and a base, as the ingredients say.\n\nSo I began looking for a non cornstarch based baking powder, and believe me, that\u2019s not as simple a task as it would seem, but I finally stumbled across some on Amazon and when it arrived, surprise surprise, it was french baking powder utilizing potato starch instead.\n\nSo being able to find non-corn related products can be done, just not easily here in America.\n\nI could go into why that is the case, but from what I can surmise, it really sounds crazy and like a conspiracy theory, so I won\u2019t.\n\nAnyway, the result of all this is that I am healthier and have lost weight in the process as the simple act of avoiding corn forces me to avoid a lot of other chemicals and ingredients that end up doing nasty things to our bodies.\n\nAnd not only that, I have become the go to guy that all my friends and family keep asking to cook for them because the food I cook doesn\u2019t have all those preprocessed ingredients in it and just tastes more fresh because, well it is just that.

{"title": "In praise of Chinese cuisine", "selftext": "Recently I saw a post where a guy who worked as a chef in a high end Chinese restaurant was mocked by his SIL, who is a chef trained in French cooking. She said something to the effect of \"all you cook is kung pao chicken.\"\n\nI was livid reading it. My wife is originally from mainland China and I've had the opportunity to travel there many times, and to different regions/cities within China. Chinese cuisine is one of the most diverse cuisines in the world. Some of the best food I've ever eaten in my life was in China (and some of the most challenging, ngl), and some of the cooking techniques can be very complex. I had one of the best bowls of noodles in my life at a steamy back alley noodle shop at 2 am after going to the bar (for about $2 CDN), and we've also been to 5 star restaurants that celebrate and elevate regional specialties.\n\nIt may simply be because a lot of Chinese restaurants in smaller North American communities (or even cities) tend to cook for western palates and don't serve more traditional dishes like what they might cook for themselves at home, but I hope this changes because there is a world of food out there that would knock your socks off.\n\nI've spent the majority of my life in a large western Canadian city known for having a large Chinese population and I thought I knew a thing or two about Chinese cuisine until I traveled there and realized that it only scratched the surface.\n\nSure, French, Italian and other European cuisines are amazing, no knock against them, but they are typically what comes to a lot of people's minds when they think of high-end dining. Chinese cuisine is so much more than sweet and sour pork or broccoli beef, and has every right to be as highly regarded as some European cuisines.\n\nAlso \"nose to tail\" cooking \u2013 so many western restaurants pat themselves on the back for making use of every part of an animal. Meanwhile the Chinese (and other Asian countries) have been doing this for centuries.\n\nMaybe I'm preaching to the choir on this thread, but I think Chinese cooking has every right to be up there with European cuisine.\n\nEDIT: It appears that I am very much preaching to the choir here. Still, I stand by my love for Chinese cuisine and hope that food lovers everywhere are able to experience the amazing flavours that are less well-known outside of China.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/othpaw/in_praise_of_chinese_cuisine/", "created_utc": 1627502411.0, "score": 3705, "author": "ToothbrushGames", "num_comments": 817, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/othpaw/in_praise_of_chinese_cuisine/", "html_title": ""}

It's packed full of Tangy, Earthy and Umami flavors, and is really simple to make. Secret ingredient and recipe inside", "selftext": "Rice is the most widely consumed food in the world and frankly it deserves that mantle for its versatility and flavor absorbing properties. While the majority of rice is cooked plain, most cultures have at least one dish where the rice is cooked with a seasoned broth, and that results in extremely flavorful rice that sometimes competes with main dishes for flavor. In the Middle East there are many different rice dishes cooked in this manner, but the one you will probably see the most is Yellow Middle Eastern Rice \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0641\u0631. It pairs amazingly with grilled meats, stews or vegetable dishes and is one of my all time favorite rice dishes. I served my rice with some spatch-cocked baby chickens and [this is how it turned out](https://imgur.com/a/twXigJ4).\n\nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link to the full video recipe](https://youtu.be/6S5oWl2RXJA). I've also left links in the comments to all my previous /r/cooking posts.\n\n## What is Yellow Rice\nThis Yellow rice isn't the only yellow rice that's served in the Middle East, and can easily be confused with [Saffron or Safflower rice](https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Saffron-Rice-5-500x500.jpg). Those rice dishes get their bright yellow color and floral flavor from the [Saffron or Safflower](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1944/9765/articles/Saffron_VS_Safflower_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520984923) they are made with, and while they are both insanely delicious, they aren't the topic of this post (let me know if you want a recipe). The Yellow Rice I am talking about gets it's color from ground turmeric, which if you've ever worked with, you'll know it could stain even the darkest of materials a bright golden color. It's also responsible for giving the rice it's earthy flavor and what can only be described as a mild back of the throat heat, though don't worry this dish is not spicy (unless you want it to be).\n\nThe other key ingredient of this rice is [Black Limes](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/styles/im_landscape_100/public/2020-02/Black-lime_0.jpg?itok=_taVFVtQ) (AKA Limo Omani and Loumi) which are basically the citrus version of Black Garlic. Black limes are an essential spice of the Arabian Gulf kitchen, and are thought to have originated in Oman. They're made by placing small limes in the sun to dehydrate and dry out, which just like with sundried tomatoes results in a concentrated, developed and umami flavor. The limes are used widely throughout the Middle East, but are especially used in Arabian Gulf, Iraqi, and Iranian cuisine. Whether used whole, or crushed into a powder, they add a developed citrus flavor with slight fermented notes to all the dishes they touch. As opposed to fresh limes, they impart a lot less acid and a more well rounded flavor than fresh citrus. In Iran, they are crushed into a powder, and used to add a citrus and light acidic flavor to stews. In Iraq they're added to most dishes as a key flavoring. There's also [dried white limes](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/whole-halved-dried-white-limes-isolated-white-background-whole-halved-dried-white-limes-167143131.jpg) which add a similar flavor to the black limes, the difference between them is usually how long they were left to sun dry. Could you make this rice with the white limes? Probably but I've always had it with the black ones and I can only think the additional drying time just further concentrates the flavor even more. \n\nMaking the rice is quite simple, you saute some diced onion, garlic, chilli, and tomatoes till softened. Add the dried limes, some cloves, bay leaves, and cardamom pods. Then add the rice and cook it with stock. It's a very versatile dish that you can easily customize by adding different vegetables, meat, spices or even nuts to suit your own taste. This version is quite simple but I find it has a flavor that will work well alongside any main dish. \n\n## Cultural Context\n\nThere's not much information that points to the origins of this rice, so instead I want to talk about the Black Limes, a precious commodity of Oman. Historically Oman was a very important trading hub, and was part of the Maritime Silk Road that connected Egypt and the Arabian Gulf to India, China and much of south east Asia. One of the key items traded along the silk road was spices, and it was how the Middle East first got ahold of many of the spices that make up the cuisine these days. Cardamom originated in India, Cloves are native to Indonesia and evidence points to the origins of limes coming from the Arabian gulf or Indonesia. In a country where summer temperatures can reach as high as 46c (120f) it's only natural that sun drying foods would become a common practice, and the Omani's sun dry a lot of foods. Common ingredients in their cuisine include sun dried dates, sun dried shark meat, and of course these sun dried limes. Sun dried foods make for great trading commodities, as they are hardy enough to survive long journeys at sea, and it is through the Maritime silk road that these lemons spread outwards to Asia. The Lemons also made it to Iraq via the port city of Basra, and in Iraq to this day they are known as Noomi Basra (Basra limes).\n\nWhile this recipe is generic and easily adaptable, it's quite closely related to [Kabsa or Machboos](https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.47/gpr.cc9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_20200523_200454-1024x768.jpg) which are the national dishes of many Arabian Gulf countries. Those are made by sauteing meat with the same ingredients as this recipe and adding crushed tomatoes to the dish as it cooks. Once the meat is cooked, it's removed and then rice is added and cooked through before the meat is added back once more. Sometimes nuts and sultanas are added for a sweet and crunchy element that compliments the rice. I wasn't able to find much historical information about the yellow rice, but that's likely because it's such a common preparation method. These days this rice is common all over the Middle East, and while it still has traces of it's Gulf origins, it's not uncommon to find it with added ingredients such as Cinnamon, Meat or herbs. You'll likely be served this rice when you order grilled meat at a Middle Eastern restaurant, and while I haven't tried it, I'm pretty sure this is the same rice served at the Halal guys carts.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nTangy, Earth and Umami, those are the three key flavors of this dish and all three are really noticeable but well balanced. The tangyness comes from the Dried black limes and the fresh lemon juice that is added. They both have different strengths, with the black lime contributing a developed and funky citrus flavor, and the fresh lemon contributing brightness and acidity. The black limes also contribute a lot of Umami flavors, and I suspect that just like with sundried tomatoes, the drying of these limes creates naturally occurring MSG. The earthiness comes from the turmeric, and it's strange how it imparts an almost back of the throat heat, without being spicy at all. It adds a very mellow flavor that I want to describe as golden (even though that makes no sense) as well as the fantastic golden color.\n\nThe Cardamom, Bay Leaves and Cloves I add are all there for some more traditional Arabian flavors. If you wanted to make this dish the longer way, you would create a chicken stock using those spices and then use the stock to season your rice, however I am adding them in directly to the rice as I'm just using a stock cube. Given how short the time is that they are in contact with liquid, they provide a light perfuming of the rice with their flavors rather than a strong sharp flavor, which I find to be really pleasant. The final components of this dish are sauted onions, tomatoes and chilli. They add a bit of a vegetabley flavor that rounds out the dish, and while the onions aren't caramelized, they do impart their delicious oniony flavor to the rice. The chilli will add heat to your rice, and it's up to you how much you use as well as what kind of chilli, but I recommend using something with a medium heat that will not overpower the rest of the dish.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 2 Cups Basmati or Long Grain rice\n* 200ml Concentrated Chicken Stock\n* 3 Garlic Cloves\n* 2 Brown or Spanish Onions\n* 2 Plum Tomatoes\n* 2-3 Black Limes (Loumi)\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 2 Cardamom Pods\n* 2 Cloves\n* 1 Green Chilli (Optional)\n* 4 Tbsp Lemon Juice\n* 2 Tbsp Butter\n* 2 Tbsp Vegetable Oil\n* 1 1/2 Tsp Salt\n* 3/4 Tsp Ground Turmeric\n* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper\n\n## Directions\n\n1. Wash your Basmati rice until the water runs clear. I place it in a mesh strainer in a bowl full of water and massage the grains until all the rice dust and surface starch has come off. I change out the water 2-3 times before setting the rice aside to dry \n2. Peel and dice your Onions to a medium-small dice about 1/2cm or 1/4in cubed you want them to be small enough to disappear into the rice but not completely dissolve\n3. De-seed and dice your tomatoes into small pieces about the same size as your onion\n4. Slice your chilli into small circles, you can remove the seeds if you want less heat\n5. Add your Butter and Oil to a heavy bottomed pot on medium heat\n6. Once melted, add the diced onion, mince the garlic cloves and add in as well\n7. Saute for about 5-7 minutes until the onions have softened and wilted. Do not let the onions brown or caramelize. I would highly recommend stirring every 30 seconds or so.\n8. Add your Green Chilli and diced Tomatoes as well as the Black Limes, Cardamom, Cloves and Bay Leaves. Mix well and saute for 3-5 minutes\n9. Once the tomatoes have softened add the Salt, Black Pepper, and Turmeric. Add the now dried rice in and stir to combine\n10. Add your lemon juice to the pot, then add enough stock to just barely cover the rice (don't do the whole knuckle above thing as that will cause it to come out mushy). It's fine if a few grains of rice are just above the surface of the water. Top up the pot with water if the stock is not enough\n11. Turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil. As soon as it boils cover with a tight fitting lid and turn the heat down to your second lowest setting. Allow it to steam for about 20 minutes\n12. When 20 minutes are up, remove the lid, the water should have fully evaporated. If not allow it to steam for a few minutes more. Once evaporated, fluff your rice up with a fork. Place the lid back on and allow it to simmer for 2 more minutes\n13. When the 2 minutes are up your rice is ready to be served\n\n## Notes and Tips\n* If you must, you can make this rice without black limes, by dehydrating some regular limes in your oven for at least 6-12 hours. I haven't tested this, but I think it will allow some of the same flavor compounds to develop, just like the homemade black garlic process\n* You can buy Black Limes at any Middle Eastern grocery store and they are also carried at some indian grocery stores too. If not, order them online, I haven't found them on Penzey's but I've seen them on amazon\n* If you are making a stock, add the spices to the stock when it's cooking so they have longer to infuse\n* Cooking time and the amount of water is accurate for basmati rice, but if you are doing any other kind, then you should add as much water as you regularly use and cook for the same amount of time you usually do\n* You HAVE to wash your rice, I get that Adam Ragusea said it's not that important the other day, but you HAVE TO wash basmati rice and here's why. Basmati Rice is delicate and easily breaks, no matter how well you package it, the rice will form a thin film of rice dust on every grain, and if you don't wash it off your rice will have a grainy texture. Another reason is that you want the rice to get super fluffy, if you don't wash basmati, you aren't removing the surface starches and your rice will come out clumpy\n* You can use 4 TBSP of either Butter or Oil, I use half of each because the butter gives a nicer flavor to the rice, and the oil gives it a nicer texture", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jkc44k/yellow_rice_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0641\u0631_is_an_iconic_middle/", "created_utc": 1603985286.0, "score": 3610, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 273, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jkc44k/yellow_rice_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0641\u0631_is_an_iconic_middle/", "html_title": ""}
