{"title": "What you should expect from a professional carpet cleaner", "selftext": "TL;DR \nit hurts my heart seeing before and after pictures of carpet cleaning by \u201cpros\u201d who suck and give me a bad name. Below is what goes through my mind and is discussed when I\u2019m doing what I do for a living.\nTL;DR\n\nYesterday I saw a post someone had issues with \u201cpros\u201d cleaning their carpets with some awesome before, after and 24 hours later pics. I commented that nothing about the performance would seem them as professional in my opinion. Lo and behold I walk into my first stop today and it looks like a similar issue. I figured I could post my process here so you all don\u2019t keep getting taken by these garbage companies.\n\n1st pic - my client had work done and the worker tracked grease onto her carpet (new since covid). She tried to remove it with OTC spot cleaner. Half of that crap can bleach out your carpet (unlikely in this case because the fiber is polyester) most of it will leave a soapy residue. She said spots came back and she only used \u201cclean water\u201d. \n\nI tested the spots with clean water from the sink. Take a few drops, put it in the center of the spot and rub it with a gloved finger. If it cleans up, or soaps up, it\u2019s a residue issue. Bonus points if you smell it and it smells like flowers r citrus. Sure enough it did \u201cclean up\u201d with just water.\n\nI informed the client of her options.\n\nOption 1 - I could treat the spots with a topical powdered defoamer and then treat the whole room and clean it as normal for my normal price but if any of the soap has gotten into the pad she may see some of the spots return in a few months. I could come back and do a deeper the of those at that time (which is more time consuming and more expensive)\n\nOption 2 - I could just do the expensive treatment on every spot and then I would happily guarantee the full removal of the spots and that should they return, I would come back for free and hit them again\n\nI recommended the first option, let\u2019s see if we even need to spend all this time and her money on this. I\u2019m going to try my best to fix it the first way without costing her too much money. I want happy clients that call me back, not ones I only clean for once.\n\nPic 2 - I applied the powdered defoamer to each spot, worked it in.\n\nPic 3 - I treated all the areas with my cleaning product. It\u2019s called {redacted possibly breaks rule 1}. I don\u2019t sell it but you can find it on Amazon. It\u2019s green, odorless, residue free and works great. After I applied that I work the carpet with a matching commonly called a Counter Rotating Brush Machine, more specifically it\u2019s called a {redacted possibly breaks rule 1}.\n\nPic 4 - is the final pic after I cleaned the carpet using a truck mounted cleaning machine. I stretch in tubes and hoses not a rolling machine you can rent from the local hardware place. My rig is less than a year old and set me back $125,000. Notice the nice \u201cV\u201d pattern under the table? I brushed the carpet after I was done. This restores the fiber pile allowing it to dry evenly. So many goobers out there skip this simple step and leave these hard lines in the carpet.\n\nHopefully this is not seen as self promotion, I just hated seeing what someone accepted as a good job when, to a trained eye, it was sub standard work at best. You all deserve better. \n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not perfect, but I will be calling this client tomorrow to make sure those spots stayed gone and dried up nicely. If not, I will be back out there fixing the problem, not making excuses to not come back.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6189a", "created_utc": 1729198623.0, "score": 10751, "author": "programedtobelieve", "num_comments": 104, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1g6189a/what_you_should_expect_from_a_professional_carpet/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One of the best cleaning tips I\u2019ve learned for depression and ADHD", "selftext": "I suffer from pretty severe executive dysfunction caused by ADHD and depression. This causes me to have a constant mental block when it comes to cleaning: I.e., I KNOW I need to do the thing, I know that I\u2019ll feel better once it\u2019s done, but I can\u2019t get myself to do it. Why? Because I feel ashamed.\n\nI was talking with a friend who\u2019s a professional cleaner, and asked her \u201cwhy is it that I can never clean my house the way that professionals do\u201d and she said one of the most profound (and probably obvious) things I\u2019ve heard.\n\nProfessional cleaners do such a thorough job cleaning because they have absolutely no emotional attachment to your house. When they see a mess on the counters, dishes piled up, dust all over the furniture, dirt on the baseboards, they don\u2019t think \u201cgod, I am such a disgusting slob for letting it go this far. How do I live like this?\u201d instead, they simply acknowledge there is a mess and then clean the mess. \nThe reason why it\u2019s so hard for me, and for so many others, is because a lot of us feel an enormous amount of shame surrounding our home. Every time I cleaned, I would beat myself up over it. Which then, gave me no motivation to clean because I didn\u2019t like the way I felt. There was no dopamine rush when I feel an emotional attachment to it. \n\nNow when I clean, I literally try and pretend I\u2019m a professional maid in someone else\u2019s house helping them clean. I see a mess, acknowledge that it\u2019s a mess, then clean it. Basically just gaslighting myself until the timer goes off and I\u2019ve conquered at least some of the mess. It\u2019s been a work in progress, and it has not happened over night but this has seriously improved my attitude around cleaning in general. I feel a lot less shame and sadness around it.\n\nI know this probably sounds dumb or obvious, but hoping this can help another neurodivergent redditor with bad executive dysfunction.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1f26t45/one_of_the_best_cleaning_tips_ive_learned_for/", "created_utc": 1724727340.0, "score": 9990, "author": "actuallychill", "num_comments": 410, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1f26t45/one_of_the_best_cleaning_tips_ive_learned_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I went down a rabbit hole on cleaning chemistry and this blew my mind", "selftext": "Soap is wild when you think about it. You lather it on, and somehow dirt, oil, even bacteria just vanish?\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I thought. Until I learned what\u2019s actually happening.\n\nThey *slide away*.\n\nThere\u2019s this thing in all good cleaners called a surfactant (short for \u201csurface active agent\u201d), and it\u2019s the reason that happens. One end grabs onto water, the other end grabs onto grease or grime. When they float around together, they trap all that mess in little bubbles (called micelles), and then water just rinses it away.\n\nNo scrubbing magic. No \u201cpoof.\u201d It\u2019s gone. Just chemistry making the surface slippery enough that the gunk lets go.\n\nNot all cleaners work like this, though. Some are made to kill germs (like disinfectants), or dissolve minerals (like acidic descalers). But surfactants? They\u2019re not killing or dissolving anything. They\u2019re just making it all slippery, so the mess lets go, and water does the rest.\n\nAlso: not all surfactants are the same. The stuff in your dish soap isn\u2019t the same as what\u2019s in your glass cleaner. I started reading labels and realized how many products I use because of these little chemical slip-agents, helping grease and grime lose their grip.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m fascinated. **Anyone else weirdly into this stuff? Or have a favorite surfactant that works way better than it should?**\n\nEdit to add: A few folks pointed out that surfactants can kill some bacteria and viruses, not only just make things slippery. \n\nI looked it up and yep, soap disrupts the lipid layer around certain viruses (like Covid), basically breaking them open, killing them, and then water rinses them away.\n\nMy husband reminded me that Alton Brown talked about this during early Covid and I\u2019d completely forgotten. Appreciate the extra learning here!\n\nEdit to add: \nWe hit a *million* views.\n\nWhat started with simple surfactants turned into a sage lesson in lye, water becoming better at being water, and a full-on Magic School Bus revival.\n\nJust because we \u201clearned it already\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we geeked out properly the first time around. Sometimes we just need the right chemistry for things to really stick.\n\nWhen Reddit said \u201ccleaning tips,\u201d you gave proof that even in a thread about soap, people are still hungry to think, connect, and marvel.\n\nThanks for showing that curiosity still has a seat at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "created_utc": 1746264834.0, "score": 6782, "author": "asleep-under-eiffel", "num_comments": 545, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "html_title": ""}

The wine had been sitting for hours, but I tried to rinse whatever I could. Then I followed the directions for the one stain remover I could get at the corner shop\u2014Dr Beckmann Stain Devil Fruit & Drinks. It has red wine pictured & listed on the front of the bottle.\n\nIt said to dilute the contents in warm water, and then soak items for several hours. I soaked the most soiled one for about two hours, as well as the damaged laces and my socks. I could hardly believe it when I checked on them about an hour and a half later.\n\nFor good measure & the sake of balance, I put everything including the spared shoe in for a little bit longer.

Etc. Etc.\n\nThe entire point of a tips reddit is to come for advice, help and expertise regarding the topic of the reddit. You will not see people posting in here things like \"How do I wipe my sink down when I pour coffee down the drain?\" \"How do I dust this small particle of dust that accumulated over 3 days on my bookshelf\"\n\nYou are going to see difficult and/or extreme cases of dirt, grime, mould, gunk and ick. That is why they've come to ask for help because the task is a lot larger or more involved than soap and water. \n\nUsually these cleaning jobs result from some challenges the person, their family or their friends are facing that have led them to that level of dirt. If you are able to wave a magic wand and give the person with the dirty space a perfectly healthy body, mind, health care, endless money, supportive relationships, time outside of work and all the little privileges that people take for granted - then you can make unhelpful comments. \n\nThe difference I think no one usually considers when leaving a judgemental, unhelpful comment on a cleaning post is this : this person is asking for your help. They understand there is a problem and they have come to you to ask for your help in remedying it. \n\nThey are not saying \"Omg look how yummy this black mould is! I'm so PROUD that I have a dog urine stain in my carpet. Look at how delicious and gross this space is, isn't it amazing!\" \n\nNo. They are saying, directly or indirectly, \"I have a problem I'd like help fixing, please.\"\n\nThey don't need to justify that help with \"My mother is severely mentally disabled and did not have the ability to clean this bathroom\" or \"I am too poor to replace this kitchen counter, I need a best case solution if that's possible or I won't have electricity this month.\"\n\nHave fun. Have a laugh. Everyone can have a good sense of humor and a chuckle online. But comments that are not supportive but are judgemental and irreverent are just mean. There are SO many spaces on Reddit and the internet to poke fun at others without them seeing it - take that energy there. \n\nLet's just aim to be a little kinder this year than we were last year.

I also HATE cleaning, I never find it fulfilling or cathartic and it\u2019s so overwhelming. \n\nIf you feel similarly, here\u2019s how I did it:\n\n1. Do NOT expect to do it all in one day! Accept & get comfortable with the idea it could take you a few days of chipping away. \n\n2. Get the floor clear first. Throw trash away, put clothes in a laundry basket (or 3), anything you need to find a home for put in a bin or on your bed temporarily. \n\n3. If you find yourself losing steam, do NOT give in immediately. Take care of one more large task (ie. Put folded clothes away, take out the trash, organize your desk) and THEN put a pin it. \n\n4. Anytime you leave the room, start a task and leave it half done. That way, when you return, you have no choice but to finish it. \n\n5. There is NO one definition of \u2018clean\u2019 - what\u2019s clean to me is certainly not clean to my mother.

Start with the smallest task, take care of it, and keep going with the momentum. It\u2019s ok if you need a break.

It was like Christmas morning and I went and started implementing.\n\nA little back story. I am a 30M and my wife is a 29FM and we do not keep our house well together (until now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the more interesting things thatth on  I've learned from this process is that clean and dirty are just how to do the habits we do everyday. Clean habits are not much harder than clean and I think have a huge payout. The other is that navigating the balance of domestic workload with your partner is tricky. Several of you recommend a book called fair play which I am still listening to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of you suggested amazing things like Marie kondo and fly Lady. I immediately began purging and putting literal trash and possessions in trash bags to dispose of. I then implemented the fly Lady morning routine and her evening routine. Having a shined sink is like a piece of heaven I never knew I wanted. Her whole app is geared towards females. Who tf cares it is golden material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso one of the troubles with cleaning and tidying I'm realizing is that I inherently wanted to be a clean individual but I did not know HOW. So I just decided I would do it even if it is poorly at first because at least that is a step.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA cool shift started to happen in my house. When my spouse would see me making the bed she would come over and help. If she saw me tidying up the living room she would chip in without even being asked to. I even got my 5 year old son putting his own clothes away (with much supervision) but the feeling is amazing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I am missing a lot but just wanted to share an update and say thank you again. If you have any questions for me or further advice PLEASE drop it below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 6/19: Thank you for all the responses and thank you for gold!

{"title": "Tips from a cleaning lady", "selftext": "Routine cleaning is necessary, whether you hire someone or do it yourself. I\u2019ve seen homes permanently damaged because they haven\u2019t been kept up with. Shower tiles held up my mold and soap scum, hardwood floors scuffed from gravel and dirt, kitchen appliances beyond the point of return. Your home is an investment, it\u2019s like if you never get the oil changed in your car.\n\nIf you\u2019ve let things go and you need help, just fork out the money for a whole home deep cleaning. Yes it\u2019s very expensive, but after it\u2019s cleaned you can actually keep up with it easier.\n\nYou don\u2019t need crazy harsh chemicals for routine cleaning. I use Simple Green or Meyers in my whole house, bathroom I use extremely diluted Odoban. \n\nMopping doesn\u2019t need to be complicated. Buy a mop that uses washable mop heads, use a concentrated cleaner like Zep Neutral Ph and dilute it accordingly. Waaaay cheaper and works waaay better. It\u2019s easier to mop small areas as messes happen. \n\nDegreaser is the most important thing in my kit. Soap scum, kitchen grease, stuck on messes on counters, greasy light fixtures, etc. I use Zep degreaser. I avoid scrubbing like a maniac at all cost, it\u2019s rarely necessary. If I need to scrub, it\u2019s a deep clean and I\u2019m charging more. \n\nLess is more. Use less laundry detergent, use less chemicals, dilute more. Products build up on everything and will attract more dirt and stink and grime. Start out with a basic all purpose cleaner, keep moving and clean everything quickly. Circle back to the problem areas with more heavy duty stuff if you need to. \n\nLastly, keep up with the dust. I have a vacuum that does hard floors and carpets well. Buy an air purifier. Do a quick, light dust once a week, it takes me 30-45 minutes to dust my entire (smaller) house. \n\nEDIT: Buy a pack of microfiber towels. I use these on EVERYTHING.

{"title": "PSA: if you clean your house, you will have a clean house.", "selftext": "Title is tautological to most of you, but my people who need to hear it know who you are.\n\nCurrently on a break from a moderate level depression clean, sorry that I didn't think to take before and afters. About 12 hours in so far, and it's been super easy and relaxing. Why? Because I've been here before, so I know how it ends. This isn't an endless struggle doomed to fail, it's just a very long task that will eventually be finished.\n\nMaybe it's gonna take you 12 hours, maybe it's gonna take 60. It doesn't matter if you do six hours a day for ten days or 15 minutes a day for eight months - once you've picked the trash off the floor, there won't be trash on the floor anymore. Once you've cleaned the bathroom, the bathroom will be clean. Maybe you'll get through like 50 packs of sponges doing it, but still, by the end, it'll be clean. Then you just spend 30 seconds a day wiping down the sink to keep it that way, and 0 seconds a day not throwing trash on the floor, et voila - you're a clean person now.\n\nOkay, you have depression, you have ADHD, you never learned how to clean growing up, I get it. One time I got too scared to open my fridge for three months, and only gave in when spring came around and I couldn't put milk in the back yard to keep it cold anymore. I've lived without heating in sub-zero celsius for a week because I was too ashamed to let anyone into the house to fix the boiler. Really, I get it. But those things make it *harder*, they do not make it *hopeless*. Your brain is telling you that there's no point putting in hours and hours of effort, because this is who you are and nothing is going to change no matter how hard you try. That's not true. You just don't know yet that it's not true, because so far you've never tried.\n\nIf you don't believe me, write down the reason why you can't spend ten minutes a day for the next six months putting your dirty clothes in the laundry basket or scrubbing the kitchen counters. Not just \"I have ADHD so I can't keep on top of cleaning\", but \"I have ADHD, therefore X, which makes it physically impossible to for me to pick up my shirts from the floor\". (If it's *actually* physically impossible for you to pick up your shirts from the floor, because you have chronic pain or paraplegia or something, you're excused and this post is not for you.)\n\nEither you'll see that your 'reason' doesn't make sense, or you'll uncover the real problem. Maybe you need to keep less stuff on the kitchen counters so that you can scrub them more easily. Maybe you need to buy a laundry basket. So write down the reason you can't immediately solve *that* problem, until you reach one that you can. (Btw, I'm telling you with 95% confidence that one of the problems is you just need to have less stuff. No, you shouldn't hang onto that thing because you're 'maybe going to need it one day', and even if you do, it's like $5 - just buy another one.)\n\nStart there. Start now. Then start again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. Set a timer for 15 minutes and just do it. Or 10 minutes if you can't face 15. Or 2 minutes if you can't face 10.

I just called CPS with your advice, and the advice from the lovely people over at r/CPS. Thank you to everyone who told me to call, gave me advice, and reassured me, the hardest part was dialing the number. I realized that this mess isn't able to be cleaned by me, and that I can't do it on my own, so I called the authorities on my mother. I don't know what's next, I don't know if things will work out, I don't even know if anything is going to happen, but I know that when I'm an adult, I won't wish I had done things differently. I'm not going to blame myself because I'll have done everything I needed to do. I would have never even considered CPS before you guys. I really mean that, the people here, those kind people who DMd me, those people who encouraged me and shared their experiences. I'm really glad that I came to this community.

{"title": "UPDATE on stinky step-son", "selftext": "\n*Please refer to my last post for this update. If I copy pasta then it\u2019ll be a long**er** post!*\n\nTLDReadlastpost; my stepson (15) moved in with us recently and he had a very bad smell stuck to him, his clothes, hair, items etc. He always had this scent to him prior to him living with us & we have tried before to help him out but to no avail, but now that he\u2019s living with us full time we decided to help him & teach him a little better. Nothing we did worked, after we would wash his clothes the smell was still there like if we never washed it. After his showers he would still smell the same. Sucks to say this but the smell was so bad I couldn\u2019t handle it and even my husband noticed the smell too, so we took it upon ourselves.\nThat\u2019s a small gist, go read before you judge. \n\n\nDue to a few redditors advice on BO sometimes having an underlying medical condition, we took him to the Dr. and step-son is in the clear. No medical issues that causes BO, labs came back clear, did a full body look over, all looks good, even went to see a derm. He does have eczema tho. The Dr did have a private talk with him about a few concerns we had. Some redditors also recommended tons of different products, body washes, detergents, advice etc and I was blown away. We tried some of the products recommended and I am so happy to say that his smell went away 89%!!! It\u2019s not stuck on him anymore like it was before. But the more we are on top of washing his clothes and sheets but also good showers, the more the smell doesn\u2019t come back. When he sweats or is outside he smells like a normal gross teenage boy, before it was different tho and very very strong like old wet carpet mold (sounds mean but it wasn\u2019t a regular smell). Dad spoke to him about importance of being clean and washing properly. And he has been doing a lot better. The problem before was (he mentioned to us): that he was home alone a lot and he really wouldn\u2019t care cause nobody told him to do it, he\u2019d wash his clothes and take it out the dryer without making sure it\u2019s dry so sometimes it\u2019s damp and he doesn\u2019t fold them, leaves them on the bed all wrinkled and when we asked him how often he would shower he just shrugged his shoulder and barely wanted to look at us while also being a boy and giggling. So that mix wasn\u2019t going too well. \n\nWhat we used: \nFor the laundry we used an odor blocking laundry detergent (Gain), an enzyme cleaner and we also got these odor eliminating/blocking little balls (I forgot the name and I\u2019m in bed already) - this mix and double heavy wash the first time definitely helped so much to get the smell out. The smell would stick on his clothes even after washing prior to this. \n\nFor his showers we got him Lume body wash, another body wash for nourishing and cleansing (to mix it up and for his eczema as well), Native shampoo/conditioner for his hair (afro), a new antiperspirant deodorant & he wanted to get an axe spray to use also so he uses it when we go out at times, we also got tons of small wash cloths (we bought tons of 18 packs so all 5 of us can use them for our bodies, face etc.) and we make sure that a new one gets used every day. I wash towels every few days so I prefer them to use a new clean one each time. We make sure him (and also our youngest son (BS11)) shower every day. For his eczema we got him Cetaphil lotion that has helped his skin a lot. \n\nI\u2019m so thankful for all that commented and gave advice! I\u2019m more than happy it wasn\u2019t a medical condition but more so hygiene and I\u2019m glad we can help him out (and without him feeling bad about it). He loves to hug me often & im glad I can now hug him without him being too stinky. Boys smell will be boys smell but unfortunately the smell he had prior was not normal teenage boy smell, now we have him smelling fresher, feeling better/confident & those smells from outside or sweating are more tolerable than before. This step momma is so happy.\n\nThank you to you all again! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/15g0qt3/update_on_stinky_stepson/", "created_utc": 1690956909.0, "score": 1852, "author": "None", "num_comments": 97, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/15g0qt3/update_on_stinky_stepson/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Have cats? Here\u2019s how I successfully minimized the \u201ccat smell\u201d in my home", "selftext": "Hello friends. Last summer, I was gone from the house for a week, and when I returned home sans the typical nose blindness, was completely APPALLED at the way my house smelled. Like stale cat booty. It sent me into a bit of a spiral, and I made it my mission to de-catify my house (at least as far as stink goes.) \n\nWell, today I got home after being away for another week and lo and behold, the cat smell is 90% gone!! For context, I have 4 cats between the ages of 6 and 10. Here\u2019s everything I did:\n\n1. Added two new air filters with true HEPA and odor control carbon filtering to the bedroom and main living area. This made the biggest difference I believe. Here is the link to the exact one:\n\nWINIX AM80 Air Purifier for Home Large Room Up to 1740 Ft\u00b2 in 1 Hr With Air Quality Monitor, True HEPA, Advanced Odor Control Carbon Filter and Auto Mode, Captures Pet Allergies, Smoke, Dust https://a.co/d/aKvDJff\n\nIt\u2019s $189 on Amazon right now, but I got it on sale for closer to $150. I also have two much cheaper Levoit air filters with the yellow pet specialty filters near the litter boxes. That helps a lot as well. \n\n2.  Changed their litter from standard gray clumping litter to World\u2019s Best Corn litter. I didn\u2019t realize what a funky smell clay cat litter has until I switched. It\u2019s pricey, yes, but I think worth it. The litter itself doesn\u2019t smell, it absorbs odors well, and lasts a long time. \n\n3.  Made it a habit to wash **all cat bedding** weekly and clean our couches with a little green machine + pet odor cleaner monthly. \n\n4.  Clean any messes with ENZYME CLEANER!!! I use the Mr. Max anti icky-poo. It sounds super weird but it really works. **ENZYME CLEANERS ARE THE ONLY CLEANERS THAT WILL TRULY FIGHT PET SMELL (NAMELY URINE/POOP) AND KEEP IT FROM COMING BACK.** It also fights it off enough to keep the cats from re-marking the same area. \n\n5.  This odor eliminator spray for any particularly stinky areas. It completely obliterates whatever stench is in the air and replaces it with a very light bleach odor/nothing at all \n\nZero Odor Multi-Purpose Odor Eliminator - Eliminate Air & Surface Odor \u2013 Patented Technology Best for Bathroom, Kitchen, Fabric, Closet- Smell Great Again, 8oz (Over 1000 Sprays) https://a.co/d/cZYEGeL\n\n6.  Dumping out and replacing ALL of the cat litter in the boxes weekly and scrubbing the crap out of the box itself each time. This may seem obvious but I genuinely didn\u2019t know that you were supposed to replace it this often and was doing it monthly if that and WOW what a difference \ud83d\ude2c\n\n7.  Replaced my plastic litter boxes. They were years old with scratches and grooves that retained so much funk I couldn\u2019t scrub it clean anymore. Starting fresh with new boxes helped so much \n\n8.  Deep clean everything (especially lower walls and baseboards where a cat might rub) with a mixture of warm water + vinegar + dawn power wash and a scrub daddy. It gets it very clean and deodorizes extremely effectively \n\n9.  Open the windows! It\u2019s amazing how much a little fresh air will do for your home. If you live somewhere miserably hot like me, even just 30 minutes first thing in the morning will help significantly. \n\n10.  Change the central AC air filter frequently and use at least a MERV13. Anything less than that and it will not catch dander. The instructions say you can go 3-4 months, but we typically change every 1-2 months to stay on top of it. \n\nEDIT: someone said the MERV13 Filter can be hard on your AC so be careful with this one!! Maybe just use regular filters and change them more often?\n\nA lot of this may seem obvious BUT I was raised in a household that had a lot of animals but wasn\u2019t really taught how to properly care of them and as a result the house was very dirty/smelly with animal funk, so I\u2019m figuring this out on my own. Having a smelly house is a huge trigger for me and I\u2019m so happy I\u2019ve made such an improvement in just a few months.

Whether it\u2019s mail, shoes, or dishes, handling things in the moment prevents clutter from accumulating.\n\nDaily resets make a huge difference, too. Spending just 10 minutes before bed tidying up, putting away blankets, wiping down counters, and loading the dishwasher\u2014helps maintain a clean home without it feeling overwhelming.\n\nAnother powerful habit is sticking to a simple daily cleaning routine. This doesn\u2019t mean scrubbing floors every day, but rather tackling small tasks regularly so messes never build up. Making the bed in the morning, wiping down the bathroom sink after use, and doing a quick vacuum or sweep at night keeps everything under control.\n\nMinimalism also plays a role, the less stuff you have, the less there is to clean.

I went ahead and bought it because it was so majorly discounted (originally sold for $2k ish I think?) but have since decided that it will not be the dress I wear for the wedding. So I decided to wear it for our (unconventional) engagement photoshoot, fully aware that the dress might get ruined. We laid in a stream filled with algae and moss and the pictures are looking beautiful so far but the dress is looking\u2026 rough. When we got home I rinsed it as well as I could with cold water to get debris/dirt/sand off and squeezed it dry with a towel before air drying. There\u2019s still quite a lot of algae and nature bits on it and it definitely still smells pond-like. Does anyone have tips for how to gently clean it to get rid of the debris and smell and such? Since I paid so little for it I don\u2019t really want to spring for taking it to a cleaner that might charge me 2-4x as much as I paid for the dress. Also, if it\u2019s ruined, it\u2019s ruined! I\u2019m prepared to say goodbye to it, but would like to try to clean and keep it if possible. \nThe dress is called Olena by Willowby.

{"title": "Microfibers won't be clean unless washed at above 67\u2103", "selftext": "I recently went on a quick Google search for microfiber cleaning services in my area, and I could not believe the amount of microfiber cleaning tutorials I ran across that recommend cleaning microfiber cloths at *low heat*.\n\nAfter I left high school, I took a commercial cleaning course to fill out my schedule while applying for jobs. The course covered several scientific topics, and there was a special focus on the science of microfibers.\n\nApparently that's all some sort of secret knowledge, at least judging by what's easily accessible to the general public online.\n\nI thought I'd try to improve the situation, so here are a few useful facts about microfiber cloths.\n\n**Microfiber cloths 101**\n\n* Microfibers are microscopic strands of fibers. Since the strands are so thin, microfiber cloth has a much higher strand density and a much larger surface area than cotton or paper cloth.\n* Due to a scientific principle called *capillary action,* microfiber cloth is thus also much more absorbant than cotton or paper cloth.\n* When dry, microfibers are statically charged (*positive*). This means they attract and hold on to tiny particles like dust, dirt, and grease of the opposite charge (*negative*).\n* Once dust, dirt, and grease is trapped within a microfiber cloth's dense fibers, static charge (when *dry*) or capillary action (when *wet*) will keep it trapped within the fibers.\n* **The only way to release trapped dust, dirt, and grease is to heat the microfiber cloth above 67\u2103.** Microfibers consist of a specific ratio of polyester and polyamide which only soften above 67\u2103. Once softened, the structure responsible for its unique cleaning properties is temporarily disabled, which allows trapped particles to be released.\n* **Do not wash microfiber cloths above 95\u2103.** Although microfiber cloth needs to be washed above 67\u2103, it melts above 95\u2103.\n* When washing microfiber cloth, never mix with other materials that release lint. Lint will clog the microfibers, making the cloth much less effective than cotton or paper cloth.\n* Do not use softener when washing microfiber cloth. Just like lint, softener will clog the microfibers.\n* Make sure your washing machine and dryer are clean when washing microfiber cloths. Leftover lint and dirt will clog a microfiber cloth.\n* You should be able to tell whether a high quality microfiber cloth is relatively clean (free of particles) just by touching it. It should cling to your skin, leaving your skin feeling dry where you touched it.\n* Beware of counterfeits and low quality cloths labeled as \"microfiber\". Unfortunately, some retailers claim to sell microfiber cloth made from synthetic materials that don't meet the definition of microfiber. A quick way to determine if a cloth is actual microfiber is to touch it to your skin.\n* **Avoid cleaning delicate surfaces with dirty microfiber cloths.** Particles trapped in a microfiber cloth can easily scratch delicate surfaces like a flatscreen monitor.\n\nThere's much more to learn about microfibers, but the points above cover the information that's important to remember when it comes to buying and cleaning with microfiber cloths.

{"title": "[Final Update] My clothes smell insanely bad after drying", "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\n[First post about this problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1hlq992/my_clothes_smell_insanely_bad_after_drying/)\n\nSo after lots of drama, lots of attempts, I think I (or rather you guys) have found the solution. Thanks to each and everyone for taking part in this little midlife laundry crisis I had, literally thanks for all the time you guys have spent trying to help, even recommending me to go to a doc. Luckily it wasn't needed. I found tons of advice, tons about Borax, but please note - **Borax is illegal in Germany**. If a German here ever asks again about stinky clothes, do not recommend Borax. You need a license go purchase this stuff, as stupid as it may sound. Some people told me to just use vinegar and little to no detergent, which I've already tried once, but not on 60\u00b0C, and not in several cycles. And that's exactly what I did now, and it was f-ing time consuming.\n\nIt wasn't the drying process which usually takes around 15-20 hours. This has **always** worked in the 10 years I've done my own household. It can't just suddenly stop working with all my clothes starting to smell funky.\n\nIt wasn't my washing machine. It wasn't my dryer. It wasn't TECHNICALLY the detergent, nor the fabric softener. It wasn't me too, or my deodorant, or anti perspirant.\n\nIt was a combination of both detergent and fabric softener, and maybe the 40\u00b0C cycles I've always used. The latter is unconfirmed, but here's what I did:\n\nI washed my clothes at 60\u00b0C, with vinegar added into the fabric softener compartment, and half a cup of vinegar on my clothes. I also added ~20% of the detergent I usually use, and only filled the machine 1/3rd full. Usually it's 3/4ths full, with some sufficient space on top. I never stuff my machine, it would scare me.\n\nI washed my clothes for one full heavy cycle, over 3 hours long.\n\nI then instantly started another cycle, this time with only around 2 teaspoons of detergent (powder, always powder), no vinegar. Same big cycle, 60\u00b0C, over 3 hours, with an extra soaking cycle.\n\nAfter that, a final third full heavy cycle, this time not even 1 teaspoon of detergent. No vinegar.\n\nI took my clothes out, and they felt.. different. Like they've never felt before. I could feel every fibre of my cotton hoodies, everything. They just felt weird, like freshly washed hair, rather than just.. fabric. They almost felt \"squeaky\" if you know what I mean. They smelled like nothing, combined with a tiny hint of \"fresh laundry\". But it was insanely faint.\n\nI hung them to dry next to my heating element, like I always do. Extremely worried about the smell coming back, I waited for hours and hours. After around 10 hours, they usually start smelling bad already.\n\nThis time, there was no smell at all. They just smelled like.. cotton. A very neutral, unusual smell to me. Not like vanilla or some other stuff, just straight up cotton with a soft touch of \"fresh\", almost natural smelling.\n\nNow, 1 day later, clothes fully dry, I made the final test. My family came over (last christmas day), and I wore one of the shirts that usually REEKED like \"what the f\". I wore it all day long.\n\nFinal result - It smells like nothing, still. Just a hint of food, as we cooked a lot. Usually, if the clothes just smell slightly funky, bodyheat will multiply it SEVERELY. It will go from \"eh it's half as bad\" to \"oh god it's back full force\" as soon as they heat up and become slightly moist again. This just didn't happen. Holy shidd I just lost a huge burden in my life.\n\nThe smell is.. gone. It's literally gone. I imagine some people hit the spot right on - It was the fabric softener just layering over and over all the dead stuff that collected in the clothes, enclosing dirt, human particles, smells, and all that other stuff over weeks and months. By washing new clothes with old clothes, I might have transferred that stuff into the new clothes too, which is why newer clothes also started smelling almost instantly now.\n\nIt's fixed.

This means that my house gets a once a month FULL reset. My house never gets super messy, because the reset is once a month every month. This means I am putting absolutely everything away and clearing all services. Knowing that the cleaners will be coming gives me the motivation to keep my house in check. \n\nHiring a cleaning service does not mean that I do not clean. Cleaners will not declutter for you, they will only clean fully cleared surfaces. The cleaners will not pick up anything other than things like a hand soap, to clean surfaces. I still have to do my dishes, pick up things off the floors and keep my house fully clutter free. I will admit that I am not completely perfect, there are months where I have skipped the cleaning service. I also do not have the cleaners clean my walk in closet, because I have not found a way that works for me to keep that clutter free. \n\nIf anyone has any questions, I am happy to answer!

{"title": "Update to mystery smell: it wasn't urine, it was gas", "selftext": "Four months ago I made a post asking for help about a mystery smell and I got a lot of very helpful suggestions. I thought it was urine (it was sort of musty and smelt bad, honestly quite similar to urine) and came intermittently. Because it was strongest in the hallway outside my bathroom, I focussed my attention here.\n\nIn the following months I bought a black light, hired a plumber, used drain cleaners, used enzyme cleaners, checked the electrics, everything. Nothing worked and I was losing my mind because no one else could smell it. There didn't seem to be any pattern to the smell, except that it got much worse when I tried to ventilate the house. \n\nMy kitchen is located directly below the hallway in question. I eventually realised that the smell also got worse when the kitchen door was open, and initially I blamed the extractor fan. My boiler is kept behind a cupboard door (although it has small gaps at the bottom), and it wasn't until I opened the door and got a faint whiff of gas that I put the two together. It was very slight, enough to make me doubt myself; after I smelt it for the first time, I couldn't smell it again. The emergency gas service later told me that I had a tiny leak coming from underneath the boiler. No one else could smell the gas, not even from inches away. \n\nEverything is fine now, and I'm ventilating the house to reduce the residual smell. I just wanted to put this in here in case it's helpful to anyone else. Clearly I'm not very good at identifying smells, but I'm glad I stuck to my guns when I eventually figured it out. \n\n\nOriginal post: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/MJV7yGebMn", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1ea3zt3/update_to_mystery_smell_it_wasnt_urine_it_was_gas/", "created_utc": 1721728793.0, "score": 1206, "author": "None", "num_comments": 42, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1ea3zt3/update_to_mystery_smell_it_wasnt_urine_it_was_gas/", "html_title": ""}

And not, like, \"a bit of pee made contact with my seat\", but \"my entire bladder emptied as I sat in the drivers seat\" (which is cloth).\n\n\"But, you fool, why didn't you pull off and pee somewhere? You're a man, you can pee **anywhere**!\"\n\nDespite literally having a list of spots of \"where can I pee, if I feel I won't make it all the way to work?\" (small edit : my commute is about an hour, and it's \\~95% highway), various traffic conditions prevented me from reaching them in a safe manner, and obviously in a timely manner, as well.  It was a full series of moments where it felt like the universe was actively conspiring against you.\n\nI'm currently at work (thankfully I have my own small office) sitting on a tall stack of sealed reams of paper and textbooks. My car seat ([which is the same as this one](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.gn1uER17kNcIPFX34D4DggAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)) isn't **soaked**, but towards the front it does feel damp to the touch. I was basically 99% of the way to work when it happened, so I'm an hour away from home , but I do have leeway to leave, if I must.\n\nThis is my first car, and I've never had to contend with cleaning liquids, before, let alone something like THIS. I truly don't even know what to do, what to buy, where to start, please, please advise.\n\nThanks\n\nUpdate :\n\nI went home, **obviously**. Used a crapton of paper towels and half of an old Halloween costume from my trunk on the seat. Purchased a container of Nature's Miracle (the red bottle) on the way. By the time I got home the seat was basically dry, and I really went to TOWN, spraying the stuff, with the windows cracked to aid an air dry. I guess I'll let it air dry, and repeat after it dries, for the rest of the evening.\n\nI appreciate the comments and concerns regarding my health. I cannot discount that option, and will try to keep that possibility in mind, but for a number of reasons I think of this primarily as an error in judgement. I don't really wanna get into it here, since my primary reason for posting is for cleaning the car, but I do appreciate the concern and will try to remain cognizant of that possibility.\n\nLastly, one person said \"You really didn't answer the question of why you didn't pull over and urinate on your own car.\"\n\nTRUST ME, if there had been a safe place on the highway to do so, I would have! When I finally was off the highway, the number of people I saw, this morning, in places that are typically all-the-way-empty truly **shocked** me.\n\nThank you all for the advice and kind words.

{"title": "For those curious what's so great about Barkeeper's Friend...", "selftext": "This sub seems to love BKF (myself included) so I thought I'd write a post detailing the chemistry behind it. My background is as a PhD organic chemist but recently I've also dealt some in formulating cleaning/sanitizing chemicals.\n\nThe key ingredient for BKF is oxalic acid. It's really what differentiates it from other similar products. As far as I know it's one of the few products that uses it. From the latest SDS I've seen, the ingredients are glass oxide, oxalic acid, and some surfactant. The glass oxide can't be overlooked because it makes up the bulk of the product and serves as an abrasive. But as I mentioned, oxalic acid is the key. For those of you who may not know, oxalic acid is the simplest of the dicarboxylic acids. You can think of it as acetic acid (acid in vinegar) but with an acid on both ends and quite a bit more acidic. So when compared to vinegar it's more acidic.\n\n It's also a good chelator meaning in can bind metal ions. This makes it great for soap scum and hard water buildup which are largely comprised of salts of Mg and Ca. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, a surfactant in almost all soaps tends to react with hard water and precipitate this soap scum. This is also why it's also effective on rust being able to bind the Fe. \n\nOxalic acid is also decent for the passivation of stainless steel. This is essentially a reaction done on the outermost layer of steel which make it more resistant to corrosion. I typically do this with nitric acid or citric acid, but oxalic acid also can work. That means that cleaning your sink with it also helps protect the metal.\n\n Some people have concerns with the toxicity of oxalic acid. As I mentioned it's a great chelator and thus can chelate ions vital to your body and form oxalate salts toxic to your kidneys. But this shouldn't be a concern unless you plan on eating lots of BKF (which I discourage). Anyway, some of you may already be aware of all of this, but hopefully some of you found it interesting and informative. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer. I'm in no way affiliated with BKF but I have been working with oxalic acid a lot recently.\n\nEdit: By popular demand, I've decided to employ a novel formatting technique...the paragraph.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/whcocl/for_those_curious_whats_so_great_about_barkeepers/", "created_utc": 1659751290.0, "score": 1106, "author": "pecan_sandies90", "num_comments": 136, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/whcocl/for_those_curious_whats_so_great_about_barkeepers/", "html_title": ""}

One ducked out early, \"No, thanks.  That sounds like work,\" but the other was game.\n\n*I. Dirty Bowls*  \nWe created test bowls with\n\n* 1.2g of butter (1/4 tsp),\n* 2.0g strawberry Nesquik (1 tsp),\n* 1.7g ground oats (1/2 tsp), and\n* 0.7g ground cinnamon (1/4 tsp).\n\nWe felt this would give us a chance to test fat, sugar, and two variants on insoluble fiber.  And the concoction would provide a fairly uniform test surface to see where the bowls were cleaned and where they were missed.  [Example bowl](https://imgur.com/kTOzeru).\n\n*II. Repeatable environment*  \nWe didn't want the bowls to get special treatment, so we filled [the bottom](https://imgur.com/63etfDS) and [top tray](https://imgur.com/0SsOncK) with a load of clean tableware.  Only the bowls would change from wash to wash.\n\nWe also checked our [Owner's Manual to ensure we were following recommended placement](https://imgur.com/g3kc8Gg).\n\n*III. Variation*\n\nWe started with the tightest stacking possible, allowing one \"prong\" of space between bowls.  The bowls are big, so even though the top tray has twelve prongs, were were only able to fit six bowls.\n\nWe then expected to increase the spacing to two and three prongs of spacing: fewer bowls but better water access.  [The first test run looked like this](https://imgur.com/0SsOncK), where the first bowl leans a bit more and the last bowl is a little tight.\n\n.\n\n**RESULTS**  \n[We were surprised by the results](https://imgur.com/fK3hGRk).  Only the first and last bowl showed residue.  The middle bowls were clean.  One prong was enough for most of the first test set.\n\nSo we scrapped the two- and three-prong spacing.  We \"reset\" the test bowls to dirty. We turned the first bowl around and gave the back bowl a little more spacing.  [The second run looked like this. ](https://imgur.com/Iw1fRP6)\n\nCinnamon turned out to be quite pernicious.  While the second test shows some residue on the five test bowls, we also observed similar spots on the clean dummy cups in the upper tray.  It turns out that dumping over 3g (1 tsp) of cinnamon in your dishwasher hampers its cleaning abilities.\n\n.\n\n**CONCLUSION**  \nI will be more mindful to give the back bowl a little more space and either put a \"clean\" bowl in the front or turn it around if it needs a little extra attention.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1i6oe0i/scientificish_experiment_on_how_stacked_bowls_are/", "created_utc": 1737481572.0, "score": 1028, "author": "TA201805091716", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1i6oe0i/scientificish_experiment_on_how_stacked_bowls_are/", "html_title": ""}

It\u2019s disgusting and makes me feel physically sick to look at.\n* **Laundry -** I have a huge pile of dirty clothes, but I only wash the absolute minimum to get by. I\u2019m scared to do more because I know they\u2019ll just get dirty again in this filthy house.\n* **Floors -** There\u2019s visible dirt, dust and food remnants on the floor. I don't even like walking barefoot anymore. It feels endless.\n* **Mental block -** I work full-time, Monday to Friday, until 6 PM. Even though I technically have time after work, I never feel like I *can* use it. The mess feels so big that I think I have to fix *everything all at once* \u2014 and that pressure just paralyzes me every time.\n\nI want to change this as I feel a little better and a bit motivated.

We were convinced it had just settled into the grout. At this point I'm cleaning to area 3 times a week. One day I decided I was just going to take the seat apart and maybe take it outside and hose it down. I did not have to get far to find the problem. Where the seat lid meets the back of the toilet was the foulest puddle you have ever seen. I now take it off once a week to clean and am still amazed what amasses in that time. We all had similar stories and I decided to post in case someone out there has not yet discovered the  source of \"that smell\" in their bathroom.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/14sgg9b/boy_parents_if_you_are_not_taking_the_toilet_lid/", "created_utc": 1688665606.0, "score": 968, "author": "FrostyCranberry3480", "num_comments": 210, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/14sgg9b/boy_parents_if_you_are_not_taking_the_toilet_lid/", "html_title": ""}

I am desperately in need of some tips to try to save my dryer. \n\nContext:\n\nI\u2019m an overwhelmed overtired single mother who hired a sitter so I could take a nap. I agreed she could bring her child, so she comes over with her girlfriend and her daughter, and I go in my bedroom to take a nap while they watch the kids. I woke up to use the bathroom, and I noticed she was mopping my floor. I told her \u201cyou do not have to do that, I just hired a deep cleaner Thursday.\u201d (It was Monday) And she replied back \u201cI want to, one mother to another.\u201d I insist it again, you do not have to clean, I had already told her once not to mess with the circuit panel\u2026 another story lol. *I just wanted to pay somebody so I could take a nap*. I paid them $20 an hour, stayed for 4 hours, they go home. Only mentioning this because I did pay for the babysitting, it was not free.\n\nOnce they left, I realized they had taken the towels in my garage that I used to clean up a coolant leak and put them in my washer and dryer! Not only that, but my brother and father lived in this house before me, somehow they found some clothes in the garage somewhere, and those were washed as well. I tried to clean the lint trap, but I didn\u2019t think much of it, other than being irritated that stuff went into the washer/dryer that shouldn\u2019t have. \n\nFast forward to today, I hadn\u2019t used the dryer bc I use my clothesline (which she would\u2019ve known if she would\u2019ve asked me), and I smell fire. I run to the bathroom and sure enough, dryer smells like it\u2019s about to catch fire. I stopped it, hold out a towel which reeks like burned stuff, so I\u2019m 1000% sure that it\u2019s coming from the dryer. I pulled out the lint trap again, I never thought to look *UNDER* the lint trap\u2026 well that\u2019s what\u2019s in the pictures. Also I took these after cleaning it twice I didn\u2019t think to take them initially I was shocked.\n\nI am terrified to use my dryer again, is there any way to remove all this stuff? There\u2019s about 3 pounds of sand through it. Or will I need to get a new washer/dryer?  My grandparents bought this for me when I got the house, it\u2019s a GE stacker washer/dryer combo. Lint trap is in the front if anyone is familiar\u2026 I just love my house dearly and I don\u2019t want it to burn down.

{"title": "How I Turned Shower Cleaning from a Dreaded Chore into a Quick, Effortless Daily Routine", "selftext": "If you\u2019re like me - always busy and constantly finding excuses to avoid cleaning the shower - you probably know the pain of staring at a dirty tile shower every day. My wife and I both hate cleaning it, and for years we just tolerated the grimy buildup because neither of us wanted to dedicate the time or effort to scrub down the large surface area.\n\nRecently, though, I stumbled upon a game-changing hack that has not only kept our shower spotless but also eliminated the frustration and guilt of neglecting it. Here\u2019s what I did:\n\nOne day, while waiting for my conditioner to work its magic (it needs to sit for three minutes, and I always found that downtime annoying), I grabbed my washcloth, rubbed some bar soap on it, and scrubbed a 3x3 foot section of the tile. Then I used the shower wand to rinse it off. The result? That section of the shower looked brand new!\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve made it a daily habit. Every time I shower, I pick a different section of the tile (rotating around the shower) and spend those three \u201cconditioner minutes\u201d giving it a quick scrub and rinse. I don\u2019t use any fancy cleaners\u2014just the same bar soap I use on my body, which works surprisingly well on the tile. It cuts through the grime, and it leaves the shower smelling fresh and clean.\n\nIn just one week of doing this, the entire shower is sparkling, and it feels like a brand-new space. It\u2019s so satisfying to see the difference, and because I\u2019m tackling it a little at a time, it doesn\u2019t feel like a chore at all. I\u2019ve even started looking forward to my showers because I know I\u2019m knocking out a previously dreaded task without carving out extra time in my schedule.\n\nWhy this works so well:\n\t1.\tIt\u2019s efficient: I\u2019m already in the shower, so there\u2019s no setup or extra time needed.\n\t2.\tIt\u2019s low effort: A single section takes less than three minutes.\n\t3.\tIt\u2019s satisfying: Seeing a freshly cleaned section every day is motivating and reinforces the habit.\n\nPro tip: If you don\u2019t use bar soap, you could try liquid soap or even a dab of body wash. I\u2019ve also heard people say vinegar or dish soap works wonders, but honestly, bar soap has been so effective that I haven\u2019t felt the need to experiment.\n\nThis hack has genuinely made such a huge difference in our household. The shower stays clean, my wife is thrilled, and I\u2019ve turned something I hated into something that feels productive and easy. If shower cleaning is your nemesis too, I highly recommend giving this a try. It\u2019s one of those small changes that can make a big impact!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1ice5s4/how_i_turned_shower_cleaning_from_a_dreaded_chore/", "created_utc": 1738102959.0, "score": 887, "author": "None", "num_comments": 130, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1ice5s4/how_i_turned_shower_cleaning_from_a_dreaded_chore/", "html_title": ""}

She showed me her bucket and there were normal things in there like toilet cleaner, spray away, pledge, etc. \n\nSo, whenever I walked in my house after she was done, she had used some sort of homemade apple cinnamon mixture on literally EVERYTHING. My marble, toilets, bathtubs, shower, floor, rugs, EVERYTHING. My entire house smells like cheap glade plug in\u2019s. The smell is so strong. I\u2019m so nauseated and lightheaded. The smell is in my clothes, my hair, my water bottles. I\u2019m so overwhelmed. I was able to air out the house today with both the front and back door opened, along with a huge box fan. I did this for hours and the smell is still in the house. I\u2019ve mopped 4 times with vinegar and water, dawn & water, and just plain water. I don\u2019t know how to get this smell out of my house. I want to move out it is so freaking bad. It\u2019s literally seeped into my phone case. I asked her what she used, and she just said she makes this homemade mixture with products that her sister sends her from Mexico. The floors in the whole house are sticky. It\u2019s like an oil that won\u2019t come off. There\u2019s footprints everywhere from whatever she mopped with. She also used bleach on my marble (after I told her she can not use bleach on marble) and then used the same mop head around my son\u2019s $3,000 Restoration Hardware rug and completely ruined it. The entire edge of it is stained and all I received was an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. \n\nMy question is, how can I get this disgusting smell out of everything in my house!? Like I said, I\u2019ve tried mopping with dawn and vinegar and using the fans. Being in my house is making me sick. I\u2019m not someone who uses a lot of scents and chemicals. I get bad migraines. I\u2019m seriously stressed. I feel like my house is ruined. \n\n\n\nEDIT- everyone, thank you so much for the advice and making me feel like I\u2019m not being dramatic. There\u2019s lots of good advice in the comments. I appreciate it so so so much!!!!\ud83e\ude77\n\nEDIT 2: Guys, I finally messaged her and asked her what exactly she used because I\u2019m miserable.

I was sick of telling my kids I have no time to play because I felt like I needed  to clean. I looked on here for tips and ideas on how to save time and for the first time in my life I feel like I\u2019ve finally figured it out. So I did a thorough clean of the whole house, which took 2 hours. Then I used the method of every day, starting at the front door working clockwise around the house, cleaning and tidying having a cleaning caddy on hand with all the essentials. I now do this every day and my cleaning time is down to half an hour. I cannot believe how incredible it feels to live in a constantly clean house with so little effort. I feel like I have my life back. Just wanted to share this somewhere \ud83e\udd13\n\nEDIT: for anyone who wants to know the details!\n\nI grab a caddy I made up from under the sink which has-\n\nKitchen spray \nBathroom cleaner\nToilet cleaner \nDenture tablets (hack for easy way to clean a toilet)\nWindex \nMr sheen \nPaper towel\nSponge\nScrubbing brush \nRubber gloves\n\nHaving the caddy makes it so much easier to just simply get it done. Instead of having to go find the stuff I need it\u2019s literally right there with me so it only takes a second.\n\nI start at the front entry way then kind of scan the room in a clockwise direction and wipe away anything that needs it. Crucially, anything that needs to be put away I put on the dining table and put away all the miscellaneous things at the end so I don\u2019t waste time walking around from room to room getting distracted. I group them into the different rooms they belong to to make it quicker to put them away.\n\nI don\u2019t make every room 100% perfect. I leave it at about 90%, and do a little thing like for example in the bathroom I might clean the bathroom mirror one day and the next I change the hand towel and rinse the toothbrush holders. I just do a tiny thing every day and then I never have to do a big deep clean of the bathroom. \n\nI know it probably sounds like a lot but it\u2019s cut back on my cleaning time massively.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1658owv/i_finally_learned_how_to_be_a_clean_person_aged_40/", "created_utc": 1693383566.0, "score": 838, "author": "creamandblack", "num_comments": 75, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1658owv/i_finally_learned_how_to_be_a_clean_person_aged_40/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I have almost cleaned my depression room except one thing and it terrifies me... help", "selftext": "So, last year I started cleaning my depression room through a slow and steady process, while staying in another room in the house that I do manage to clean regularly now that I am more familiar with basic cleaning. I have almost finished cleaning my depression room except one thing that has remained in the same spot in the room for the last 3 years and that I feel really terrified of and it's very embarrassing so please bear with me...It's a backpack that I used when going on a trip 3 years ago and unfortunately I have very bad memories associated with that trip and the bag, which is why I left it in the same spot in that room I was not using for 3 years... The bag contains dirty clothes and underwear from that trip and the thought of opening it now seems gross and terrifying to me even though I do want to get rid of it now that I am mentally feeling a lot better and have somehow recovered from what happened.My paranoid concern is that I might contract some form of an illness from the underwear or something (even though it is mine) because of the bacteria(?) and how long it has been sitting in the bag.\n\nI know this is very gross, stupid and embarrassing and I really do apologize for that. I have no other person/community to ask and I have been avoiding this issue since that point in time but I want to do something about it now and I figured this is the most appropriate community to ask. That backpack used to be one of my favorites and I would prefer not to throw it away but I do understand that because of the situation I might not have any other choice but do that.\n\nAny advice would be helpful... I will try to answer any further questions as best as I can.  \n\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the helpful comments and advice! I am so thankful to have received all of this advice, support and encouragement! After reading the comments I have decided to retrieve 1-2 (not fabric) items from the small front pocket of the bag and only open that. I will not open the main compartment of the bag as I really do not want to be reminded of any memories related to that trip. I will then throw the entire bag away. I will buy a new backpack and take some photos of the old one in case I want to find it and buy a pre-owned one at some point.

{"title": "How to Tackle Stubborn Carpet Stains with Eco-Friendly Methods", "selftext": "Carpet stains can be a nightmare, especially when they\u2019re deep-set or have been around for a while. But don\u2019t worry\u2014there are effective, eco-friendly cleaning solutions you can try at home!\n\nHere are some of the best methods to clean and restore your carpets without harsh chemicals:\n\n# 1.\u00a0Baking Soda & Vinegar Method\u00a0\ud83c\udf5a\ud83e\uddf4\n\n* **How It Works**: Baking soda is a natural deodorizer and can absorb odors, while vinegar helps break down stains.\n* **How to Use**: Sprinkle baking soda on the stain, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then spray it with vinegar. Let it fizz, then blot it up with a clean cloth. Repeat if necessary.\n\n# 2.\u00a0Dish Soap & Water Solution\u00a0\ud83e\uddfd\n\n* **How It Works**: Dish soap is great for lifting greasy stains, especially those from food or beverages.\n* **How to Use**: Mix a tablespoon of dish soap with two cups of warm water. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, gently scrub the stain, then blot with a dry towel.\n\n# 3.\u00a0Hydrogen Peroxide (3%)\u00a0\ud83d\udca7\n\n* **How It Works**: Hydrogen peroxide is a mild bleach and works wonders on stubborn, dark stains, including pet accidents.\n* **How to Use**: Apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, then blot it up with a towel. Always test a small hidden area of the carpet first.\n\n# 4.\u00a0Steam Cleaning\u00a0\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\n\n* **How It Works**: Steam cleaning uses hot water and minimal cleaning solution to lift dirt and stains without chemicals.\n* **How to Use**: Rent or purchase a steam cleaner, and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. It\u2019s great for deep cleaning and sanitizing without harsh chemicals.\n\n# Tips for Maintaining Clean Carpets:\n\n* **Vacuum Regularly**: Prevent dirt from embedding by vacuuming your carpets at least once a week.\n* **Treat Spills Immediately**: The sooner you address a spill, the easier it is to remove.\n* **Use Doormats**: Place doormats at entryways to reduce dirt being tracked into your home.\n\n**Have any of you used these eco-friendly methods before?**\u00a0What other cleaning tips do you swear by for keeping carpets looking fresh?\n\n[https:\\/\\/cleaning-rockford.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/eafs165gjyye1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2643abc64acda5b7c72530e1223b0a5b57dc305)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kfaks7/how_to_tackle_stubborn_carpet_stains_with/", "created_utc": 1746448701.0, "score": 1, "author": "Past-Stomach-3504", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kfaks7/how_to_tackle_stubborn_carpet_stains_with/", "html_title": ""}

My mom recently bought an old chest of drawers dresser at a local shop that has been hand painted on the outside.  We didn't notice any smell in the place she bought it at, but after we got it home it made her bedroom smell horrible.  We immediately took it out to the garage until we can figure out a solution.  The smell is probably what you would expect.  It's kind of like an old, antique type of smell that I've noticed in other antique type things in shops, but this dresser has it very strong.  We opened the drawers to air it out once it was in the garage, and the whole garage smells and it's like seeping through the door into the house.  It's strong enough that you almost get a headache from it.  The dresser is in very good shape.  As I said, the outside has been hand painted, but the inside of the drawers have not.  The inside of the drawers are wood, but also still in great shape.  There doesn't appear to be any stains or mold or anything else I can see anywhere.

{"title": "I went down a rabbit hole on cleaning chemistry and this blew my mind", "selftext": "Soap is wild when you think about it. You lather it on, and somehow dirt, oil, even bacteria just vanish?\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I thought. Until I learned what\u2019s actually happening.\n\nThey *slide away*.\n\nThere\u2019s this thing in all good cleaners called a surfactant (short for \u201csurface active agent\u201d), and it\u2019s the reason that happens. One end grabs onto water, the other end grabs onto grease or grime. When they float around together, they trap all that mess in little bubbles (called micelles), and then water just rinses it away.\n\nNo scrubbing magic. No \u201cpoof.\u201d It\u2019s gone. Just chemistry making the surface slippery enough that the gunk lets go.\n\nNot all cleaners work like this, though. Some are made to kill germs (like disinfectants), or dissolve minerals (like acidic descalers). But surfactants? They\u2019re not killing or dissolving anything. They\u2019re just making it all slippery, so the mess lets go, and water does the rest.\n\nAlso: not all surfactants are the same. The stuff in your dish soap isn\u2019t the same as what\u2019s in your glass cleaner. I started reading labels and realized how many products I use because of these little chemical slip-agents, helping grease and grime lose their grip.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m fascinated. **Anyone else weirdly into this stuff? Or have a favorite surfactant that works way better than it should?**\n\nEdit to add: A few folks pointed out that surfactants can kill some bacteria and viruses, not only just make things slippery. \n\nI looked it up and yep, soap disrupts the lipid layer around certain viruses (like Covid), basically breaking them open, killing them, and then water rinses them away.\n\nMy husband reminded me that Alton Brown talked about this during early Covid and I\u2019d completely forgotten. Appreciate the extra learning here!\n\nEdit to add: \nWe hit a *million* views.\n\nWhat started with simple surfactants turned into a sage lesson in lye, water becoming better at being water, and a full-on Magic School Bus revival.\n\nJust because we \u201clearned it already\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we geeked out properly the first time around. Sometimes we just need the right chemistry for things to really stick.\n\nWhen Reddit said \u201ccleaning tips,\u201d you gave proof that even in a thread about soap, people are still hungry to think, connect, and marvel.\n\nThanks for showing that curiosity still has a seat at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "created_utc": 1746264834.0, "score": 6799, "author": "asleep-under-eiffel", "num_comments": 547, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "html_title": ""}

It did smell like vinegar still for a bit but that pretty much is gone at this point.\n\nI since have purchased a Bissell Little Green deep cleaner (Spot and Stain with Febreze formula) and Kids and Pets enzyme cleaner. I am a little bit concerned due to potential residual vinegar in the couch interacting with either of these cleaning products so I used the Bissell deep cleaner with just warm water to try to dilute anything left in there before applying new products, but I also may be overthinking it.

I hate when floors don\u2019t dry quickly after a mop and have a tendency to walk through the water and make the floors even worse than they were before - if I don\u2019t do that, my pets do. \n\nI\u2019m currently using a wet swiffer to clean the floors daily for all of those reasons, but real swiffer wipes are too expensive and single use, so not as environmentally friendly as I would like. I\u2019ve found that the knock off/dupe wipes I\u2019ve tried are a bit too dry and hardly clean at all. \nIs there a quick drying product I can use on the floor with a reusable mop pad that doesn\u2019t make the floors sticky or leave a residue? \nWould a spray mop be better? If so, what product would work with that? \n\nI\u2019m using it daily so affordability is important. \n\nThanks in advance!!\n\n** EDIT:**So sorry to everyone who has suggested steam mops, I totally forgot to mention that I actually have one and unfortunately as a daily maintenance tool, it does not work for me - despite being environmentally friendly, quick drying and a really good cleaner! \ud83d\ude22 The reason for this is because I have such poor executive function, I find anything with \u201ctoo many steps\u201d overwhelming and it ends up not getting done. It might not seem like too many steps to the average person, but unfortunately my very annoying brain interprets it as follows: 1) take the base out of the cupboard 2) take the handle out of the cupboard 3) plug handle into base 4) fill tank up with water 5) unwrap electrical cord 6) plug cord into power socket 7, 8, 9, 10) unplug cord and replug in cord in each new room that the cord does not reach and then basically all those same steps again to pack it up. know that may seem lazy or childish, but I\u2019m doing my best to own up to that, and to also take responsibility and come up with a solution, which seems to be the whole \u201cdaily maintenance + minimising steps\u201d technique. The swiffer works for me because it\u2019s kind of just 1) take swiffer out of cupboard 2) attach wet wipe to swiffer 3) mop 4) pack away lol\nWhen I do feel motivated, I do steam mop though because it gives such a great clean - even if it takes me 3 weeks to actually pack the mop up and put it back into the cupboard afterwards \ud83d\ude02 So thank you to everyone, it really is a great suggestion, my brain is just annoying!

I noticed that mildew had formed on them, and the styrofoam housing they sit inside. Unfortunately, even after removing some screws and prying open tabs on the front frame, i was not able to remove it because the side with the control panel would not budge. I didnt want to damage the panel. I assume that if i removed the unit from the window, and took out the main cover the unit, i would have found a way to do so.\n5) Instead, i used a screwdriver on the side of each vent to pry them out from the plastic hinges they sit in. I had to play with them for a while to get them out. They would not just slide out, like on older units.\n6) I then washed the vents in a sink, and used disinfectant wipes to remove mold from inside the styrofoam housing where the cold air comes out and the vents sit\nI really like the Danby unit, but im very disappointed that the vents are so hard to remove, and the front frames seem non-removeable while the unit is installed.

Every morning when I wake up I also smell like eggs. I've washed all the bedding several times, and now my washing machine and all the clothes that come out of it smell like eggs. I thought the smell would be gone by now but I have made a horrible mistake I'm afraid I'll have to live with it for the rest of my life. \n\nIn January I wanted to treat myself to some self-care: I drew a lovely bath and added some natural bath minerals I brought home from a hot-spring town in Taiwan.

The bath was lovely (albeit pungeant) and great for my skin, so I didn't want to rinse the residue off and wanted it to let it work its magic for a bit longer. At this point I had been bathing in sulfur for so long I got blind to the smell. So I went straight to bed. HUGE MISTAKE.\n\nI woke up and was disgusted by the smell. Each time I come home I can already smell it before even going upstairs.

I had to get it altered anyway and didn't want to hang it in a closet where my fianc\u00e9 might accidentally see it. No lectures please, I feel very dumb and wish I had had some foresight. It's locked in a room away from the cats now.\n\nI went to check it out the other day as I was planning on bringing it in for alterations soon. I found cat pee on the garment bag and, unfortunately, it bled through to the dress. (I don't know when this happened as my cats have not had any bladder issues as of late -- I am assuming it may have been around January when we got a new cat and they were all adjusting). The stain didn't seem recent.\n\nI panicked and started to wipe it down with a wet paper towel while I called my mom. That actually did a lot for the stain itself. The stains are mostly on a \"tougher\" glittery outer layer (sorry I can't seem to find the name for the fabric, but it's the material on the sides of the skirt in the attached picture) which is not very absorbent. After going in with the water and some odor remover my mom brought over, I can barely tell where they are. \n\nThe smell, however, is still very prevalent. It seemed to seep through to the more standard, absorbent layers underneath. I still have some things my mom brought over to try, but wanted to reach out here to see if anyone had any advice (or else to tell me to not even bother). I thought about bringing it in for professional cleaning but don't know if that's feasible. It weighs probably 20lbs and has intricate beading all over.\n\nI'm pretty devastated as this dress was found secondhand online. It only cost me $450 but I doubt I'll be able to find another.

{"title": "How to get cat vomit smell out of rugs?", "selftext": "I have this tightly woven wool rug (not pile) and my cats of course love to throw up hairballs on it instead of the laminate floor!

Then I elevate the corner of the rug and let it dry. \n\nThe problem is not stains but the SMELL. It will smell better briefly but then days later I smell this disgusting, pukey sour smell. The rug is also massive so it's hard to take it out from under the furniture every time they puke. I have tried seemingly everything:\n\n- nature's miracle enzyme cleaner - doesn't eliminate the smell, and the fragrance might be more disgusting than the vomit\n\n- bissell carpet cleaner - unfortunately doesn't work on this rug. It's not pile, its more like a thick and tightly woven rug. It soaks the rug but then you can't suck up the water to dry it. \n\n- dish soap + water + scrub brush - good for cleaning the residue, doesn't do anything for the smell\n\n- NonScents stain and odor eliminator - this seems to have a little bleach or something in it? It initially works but the smell comes back. But it works better than the others. And doesn't discolor the rug. \n\n-vinegar - doesn't do much. Makes the rug smell like vinegar which briefly covers up the scent until it dries\n\n- letting baking soda sit for a few hours and vacuuming it up - also does not work\n\n\nThe only thing that does work is getting the rug professionally cleaned. Unfortunately that costs between $300 and $400 and I can't do that every time they puke which is like once a month. It's also a hassle because the rug is so big. It's something I'm willing to do once per year max. \n\nIn the meantime, I'm looking for a spray or technique that will fully kill the smell between professional cleanings.

{"title": "How to Tackle Stubborn Carpet Stains with Eco-Friendly Methods", "selftext": "Carpet stains can be a nightmare, especially when they\u2019re deep-set or have been around for a while. But don\u2019t worry\u2014there are effective, eco-friendly cleaning solutions you can try at home!\n\nHere are some of the best methods to clean and restore your carpets without harsh chemicals:\n\n# 1.\u00a0Baking Soda & Vinegar Method\u00a0\ud83c\udf5a\ud83e\uddf4\n\n* **How It Works**: Baking soda is a natural deodorizer and can absorb odors, while vinegar helps break down stains.\n* **How to Use**: Sprinkle baking soda on the stain, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then spray it with vinegar. Let it fizz, then blot it up with a clean cloth. Repeat if necessary.\n\n# 2.\u00a0Dish Soap & Water Solution\u00a0\ud83e\uddfd\n\n* **How It Works**: Dish soap is great for lifting greasy stains, especially those from food or beverages.\n* **How to Use**: Mix a tablespoon of dish soap with two cups of warm water. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, gently scrub the stain, then blot with a dry towel.\n\n# 3.\u00a0Hydrogen Peroxide (3%)\u00a0\ud83d\udca7\n\n* **How It Works**: Hydrogen peroxide is a mild bleach and works wonders on stubborn, dark stains, including pet accidents.\n* **How to Use**: Apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, then blot it up with a towel. Always test a small hidden area of the carpet first.\n\n# 4.\u00a0Steam Cleaning\u00a0\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\n\n* **How It Works**: Steam cleaning uses hot water and minimal cleaning solution to lift dirt and stains without chemicals.\n* **How to Use**: Rent or purchase a steam cleaner, and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. It\u2019s great for deep cleaning and sanitizing without harsh chemicals.\n\n# Tips for Maintaining Clean Carpets:\n\n* **Vacuum Regularly**: Prevent dirt from embedding by vacuuming your carpets at least once a week.\n* **Treat Spills Immediately**: The sooner you address a spill, the easier it is to remove.\n* **Use Doormats**: Place doormats at entryways to reduce dirt being tracked into your home.\n\n**Have any of you used these eco-friendly methods before?**\u00a0What other cleaning tips do you swear by for keeping carpets looking fresh?\n\n[https:\\/\\/cleaning-rockford.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/eafs165gjyye1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2643abc64acda5b7c72530e1223b0a5b57dc305)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kfaks7/how_to_tackle_stubborn_carpet_stains_with/", "created_utc": 1746448701.0, "score": 1, "author": "Past-Stomach-3504", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kfaks7/how_to_tackle_stubborn_carpet_stains_with/", "html_title": ""}

Granted I am extra slow after my last kid and a lot of weight gain after the depression episode surrounding some horrendous life events. But all of that aside\u2026 I was asked to clean some plantation shutters yesterday. Floor to ceiling shutters just EVERYWHERE. I didn\u2019t count each shutters blade obviously but after doing some math\u2026 54 panels with 27 shutters, 12 of those panels actually having 29 shutters because they were sliding doors to get to the balcony, that comes out to 1,482 shutters. I was asked to dust all of the shutters top to bottom and take a damp microfiber to the bottom half of them. Some weren\u2019t that bad at all. Some of them had food caked on and hand prints all over them. My boss is shocked it took me as long as it did. I don\u2019t want to say how long it took because I want to see what others have to say about it first. How long would you expect that to reasonably take? I\u2019m going to attach an image of how dirty my swiffer duster was after just 2 of those panels to give some extra context on how dirty they were. \n\nAlso, if someone here does clean condos, how long does it take you to do a departure clean on an average 2/2?

I hate when floors don\u2019t dry quickly after a mop and have a tendency to walk through the water and make the floors even worse than they were before - if I don\u2019t do that, my pets do. \n\nI\u2019m currently using a wet swiffer to clean the floors daily for all of those reasons, but real swiffer wipes are too expensive and single use, so not as environmentally friendly as I would like. I\u2019ve found that the knock off/dupe wipes I\u2019ve tried are a bit too dry and hardly clean at all. \nIs there a quick drying product I can use on the floor with a reusable mop pad that doesn\u2019t make the floors sticky or leave a residue? \nWould a spray mop be better? If so, what product would work with that? \n\nI\u2019m using it daily so affordability is important. \n\nThanks in advance!!\n\n** EDIT:**So sorry to everyone who has suggested steam mops, I totally forgot to mention that I actually have one and unfortunately as a daily maintenance tool, it does not work for me - despite being environmentally friendly, quick drying and a really good cleaner! \ud83d\ude22 The reason for this is because I have such poor executive function, I find anything with \u201ctoo many steps\u201d overwhelming and it ends up not getting done. It might not seem like too many steps to the average person, but unfortunately my very annoying brain interprets it as follows: 1) take the base out of the cupboard 2) take the handle out of the cupboard 3) plug handle into base 4) fill tank up with water 5) unwrap electrical cord 6) plug cord into power socket 7, 8, 9, 10) unplug cord and replug in cord in each new room that the cord does not reach and then basically all those same steps again to pack it up. know that may seem lazy or childish, but I\u2019m doing my best to own up to that, and to also take responsibility and come up with a solution, which seems to be the whole \u201cdaily maintenance + minimising steps\u201d technique. The swiffer works for me because it\u2019s kind of just 1) take swiffer out of cupboard 2) attach wet wipe to swiffer 3) mop 4) pack away lol\nWhen I do feel motivated, I do steam mop though because it gives such a great clean - even if it takes me 3 weeks to actually pack the mop up and put it back into the cupboard afterwards \ud83d\ude02 So thank you to everyone, it really is a great suggestion, my brain is just annoying!

I noticed that mildew had formed on them, and the styrofoam housing they sit inside. Unfortunately, even after removing some screws and prying open tabs on the front frame, i was not able to remove it because the side with the control panel would not budge. I didnt want to damage the panel. I assume that if i removed the unit from the window, and took out the main cover the unit, i would have found a way to do so.\n5) Instead, i used a screwdriver on the side of each vent to pry them out from the plastic hinges they sit in. I had to play with them for a while to get them out. They would not just slide out, like on older units.\n6) I then washed the vents in a sink, and used disinfectant wipes to remove mold from inside the styrofoam housing where the cold air comes out and the vents sit\nI really like the Danby unit, but im very disappointed that the vents are so hard to remove, and the front frames seem non-removeable while the unit is installed.

{"title": "I went down a rabbit hole on cleaning chemistry and this blew my mind", "selftext": "Soap is wild when you think about it. You lather it on, and somehow dirt, oil, even bacteria just vanish?\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I thought. Until I learned what\u2019s actually happening.\n\nThey *slide away*.\n\nThere\u2019s this thing in all good cleaners called a surfactant (short for \u201csurface active agent\u201d), and it\u2019s the reason that happens. One end grabs onto water, the other end grabs onto grease or grime. When they float around together, they trap all that mess in little bubbles (called micelles), and then water just rinses it away.\n\nNo scrubbing magic. No \u201cpoof.\u201d It\u2019s gone. Just chemistry making the surface slippery enough that the gunk lets go.\n\nNot all cleaners work like this, though. Some are made to kill germs (like disinfectants), or dissolve minerals (like acidic descalers). But surfactants? They\u2019re not killing or dissolving anything. They\u2019re just making it all slippery, so the mess lets go, and water does the rest.\n\nAlso: not all surfactants are the same. The stuff in your dish soap isn\u2019t the same as what\u2019s in your glass cleaner. I started reading labels and realized how many products I use because of these little chemical slip-agents, helping grease and grime lose their grip.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m fascinated. **Anyone else weirdly into this stuff? Or have a favorite surfactant that works way better than it should?**\n\nEdit to add: A few folks pointed out that surfactants can kill some bacteria and viruses, not only just make things slippery. \n\nI looked it up and yep, soap disrupts the lipid layer around certain viruses (like Covid), basically breaking them open, killing them, and then water rinses them away.\n\nMy husband reminded me that Alton Brown talked about this during early Covid and I\u2019d completely forgotten. Appreciate the extra learning here!\n\nEdit to add: \nWe hit a *million* views.\n\nWhat started with simple surfactants turned into a sage lesson in lye, water becoming better at being water, and a full-on Magic School Bus revival.\n\nJust because we \u201clearned it already\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we geeked out properly the first time around. Sometimes we just need the right chemistry for things to really stick.\n\nWhen Reddit said \u201ccleaning tips,\u201d you gave proof that even in a thread about soap, people are still hungry to think, connect, and marvel.\n\nThanks for showing that curiosity still has a seat at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "created_utc": 1746264834.0, "score": 6804, "author": "asleep-under-eiffel", "num_comments": 550, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

She does have some urinary issues, but we can't figure out where the smell is coming from. We've checked around but can't find any obvious stains or spots.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to detect urine that might have soaked into fabric, carpet, or furniture? Maybe there's a tool or method to locate it so we can properly clean or replace the affected item?\n\n2. My rental apartment (with cats)\nI also have a rental unit where the tenants have three cats. Every time I visit, there\u2019s a strong smell of scented candles. Once, I visited when no candles were burning, and I noticed an odd odor\u2014possibly cat urine.\n\nI\u2019m concerned they may be using the candles to mask it. Is there a way to inspect the apartment and find out if there\u2019s cat urine on the floors or elsewhere?

You could hear improved water pressure blasting out of the jets and making things clean. The metal shimmering with freshness, the bottom clearer than it's been in years. *Except....* the plastic bits are still awful, possibly worse. For instance, the utensil trays which were part of my meticulous cleaning are freshly covered in gunk which is almost like tiny little pieces of kelp that wrap themselves around each and every teensy expanse of plastic.

{"title": "Cat peed on ornate wedding dress -- do I have any hope of getting the smell out?", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nSo I was a big dummy and after I bought my wedding dress, I left it in a garment bag in a box. I had to get it altered anyway and didn't want to hang it in a closet where my fianc\u00e9 might accidentally see it. No lectures please, I feel very dumb and wish I had had some foresight. It's locked in a room away from the cats now.\n\nI went to check it out the other day as I was planning on bringing it in for alterations soon. I found cat pee on the garment bag and, unfortunately, it bled through to the dress. (I don't know when this happened as my cats have not had any bladder issues as of late -- I am assuming it may have been around January when we got a new cat and they were all adjusting). The stain didn't seem recent.\n\nI panicked and started to wipe it down with a wet paper towel while I called my mom. That actually did a lot for the stain itself. The stains are mostly on a \"tougher\" glittery outer layer (sorry I can't seem to find the name for the fabric, but it's the material on the sides of the skirt in the attached picture) which is not very absorbent. After going in with the water and some odor remover my mom brought over, I can barely tell where they are. \n\nThe smell, however, is still very prevalent. It seemed to seep through to the more standard, absorbent layers underneath. I still have some things my mom brought over to try, but wanted to reach out here to see if anyone had any advice (or else to tell me to not even bother). I thought about bringing it in for professional cleaning but don't know if that's feasible. It weighs probably 20lbs and has intricate beading all over.\n\nI'm pretty devastated as this dress was found secondhand online. It only cost me $450 but I doubt I'll be able to find another.

{"title": "How to get cat vomit smell out of rugs?", "selftext": "I have this tightly woven wool rug (not pile) and my cats of course love to throw up hairballs on it instead of the laminate floor! I always pick up all the vomit carefully avoiding pushing it into the weave, then scrub with Soak cleaner, and then hit it with an enzymatic spray. Then I elevate the corner of the rug and let it dry. \n\nThe problem is not stains but the SMELL. It will smell better briefly but then days later I smell this disgusting, pukey sour smell. The rug is also massive so it's hard to take it out from under the furniture every time they puke. I have tried seemingly everything:\n\n- nature's miracle enzyme cleaner - doesn't eliminate the smell, and the fragrance might be more disgusting than the vomit\n\n- bissell carpet cleaner - unfortunately doesn't work on this rug. It's not pile, its more like a thick and tightly woven rug. It soaks the rug but then you can't suck up the water to dry it. \n\n- dish soap + water + scrub brush - good for cleaning the residue, doesn't do anything for the smell\n\n- NonScents stain and odor eliminator - this seems to have a little bleach or something in it? It initially works but the smell comes back. But it works better than the others. And doesn't discolor the rug. \n\n-vinegar - doesn't do much. Makes the rug smell like vinegar which briefly covers up the scent until it dries\n\n- letting baking soda sit for a few hours and vacuuming it up - also does not work\n\n\nThe only thing that does work is getting the rug professionally cleaned. Unfortunately that costs between $300 and $400 and I can't do that every time they puke which is like once a month. It's also a hassle because the rug is so big. It's something I'm willing to do once per year max. \n\nIn the meantime, I'm looking for a spray or technique that will fully kill the smell between professional cleanings.
