I know labels like \"organic\", \"natural\", etc, are essentially meaningless, and obviously company websites are going to give information biased in their favor. I can do research on individual companies, but it can take quite a while to compile useful information - it seems really impractical for one person to do this for all the food they buy, and all the restaurants they visit.\n\nI am not strictly vegetarian, but I tend to avoid meat because it seems to me that meat production is one of the most problematic parts of the food industry. I think this is the most effective first step I can take - but I would like to do more, if possible. I'm aware that buying packaged products in a grocery store sort of puts a limit on how much I can improve my buying habits, but I hope I can make some improvements within that constraint.\n\nSo, I would love to find a website that lists comprehensive, well-researched information about the production practices of food companies and restaurants. Things like the use of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics; whether meat is grass-fed or not (and basically anything else related to sustainabie/organic/whatever food production) I'm envisioning a simple table of companies and their practices.

{"title": "When a Programmer goes Local and Sustainable...", "selftext": "...he gets very frustrated with the existing recipe finding tools and decides to create his own.  It becomes Fridge to Food: http://www.fridgetofood.com  \n\nOkay, that's just what happened when I tried to go local and sustainable.  I got frustrated with the lack of ability to search by ingredients or find recipes that were in season.  So I decided to create my own.  \n\nTo start, it's just a basic recipe sharing site.  One that tries to take the best of what exists in various community sites on the web.  That's as far as I've gotten for the moment.  Recipe sharing, image based, vote rating, reputation and ribbons, tagging and an ingredient search engine.  I started with those features because I thought those were the ones that the most people were likely to use.  With them I hope to build up a good database of recipes and community of cooks.\n\nOnce that database is built, I can start adding more features aimed at living and eating locally and sustainably.  There's already to ability to browse the ingredients on the site.  I want to make them user editable for users with enough reputation.  And then add the ability to put in seasonality information for each ingredient.  So when looking at a recipe, you can see whether or not an ingredient is in-season or you.  Next, I want to add a sister site (or sub-site) with profiles for farms, farmer's markets, local small groceries or food producers, that sort of thing.  So when you click on an ingredient, you can get a list of places to get it locally.  \n\nThe hope is to provide a tool that takes some of the research effort out of eating locally and sustainably and makes it easier for people with less time.  And better yet, if the base features of the site are themselves useful, maybe people who had no intention of living sustainably will end up doing so just because its that easy.  \n\nWhat do you think?  Of both the idea, and the current beta execution?  Is this a site you could help build, by adding recipes+photographs, voting and by maintaining ingredients and tags?\n\ntl;dr Fridge to Food (http://www.fridgetofood.com) is a website I wrote while trying to eat locally and sustainably to make it easier.

{"title": "The Complete Guide to Sustainable Protein", "selftext": "I hear several different sources give conflicting accounts about what foods and food production methods are or are not sustainable, especially when it comes to foods that are high in protein. Some say that cattle ranching leads to vast increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Others say that the fishing industry is destroying wild fish populations and habitats. Vegans and vegetarians point to soy products as a good alternative, but I've also seen some red flags regarding soy's effect on hormone balance.\n\nSo I decided to delve into the data myself and compile a Complete Guide to Sustainable Protein. Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or omnivore, you'll discover the best protein options in terms of water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use on this list. Because high-quality protein is often expensive, I've also provided data on relative prices for each protein source. You can view the guide at http://www.kinesophy.com/2016/10/the-complete-guide-to-sustainable.html.\n\nI've also created two free bonus resources: 1) five companion recipes to the guide that incorporate less familiar ingredients like chlorella, nutritional yeast and chicken livers, and 2) a double-sided, one-page grocery shopping cheat sheet that covers the basic points of the guide. And for a limited time, you can enter to win a sustainable protein prize pack, containing organic chlorella powder, raw organic spirulina powder, nutritional yeast, and organic cricket protein powder. For those of you like me who want a comprehensive resource to help you choose foods that minimize your impact on the environment and improve animal welfare, I hope this guide serves that purpose.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/food2/comments/55ny7y/the_complete_guide_to_sustainable_protein/", "created_utc": 1475505612.0, "score": 14, "author": "greghickey5", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/food2/comments/55ny7y/the_complete_guide_to_sustainable_protein/", "html_title": ""}

The kids in the family are much more interested in online startups than fixing fences, so we are all trying to get together and create a family project. The goal is to make it easy for consumers to have the healthiest, best tasting beef in the world delivered right to your door at a much lower price than what is available at the supermarket.\nWe need you, our potential customers, to help us to shape our company. Here are the questions we are trying to answer:\nWhat is the maximum quantity of meat you would by (the larger the quantity, the lower the cost and the lower the price)\nHow would you feel about seeing a blog with information about what is going on at the ranch? Does it bother you to see photos of live animals roaming around a field when you know it will end up as a steak on your plate?\nWhat should we do about shipping? We are considering two models: one is to ship a reusable insulated container (ice chest) that you ship back. The other is styrofoam containers.

{"title": "Starting an Elderberry farmbusiness", "selftext": "Already an obsessed foodie an organic homesteader I've decided to become a new entrant to the farming community (as of this January) and got my first soil test results back a week ago, and have been waiting on the gov't agronomist to get back to me with their opinions, but I realised that what I really want to do is crowd-source some most likely more valuable info from a diverse community. I've only just quit (?) my job with the goal of generating income off our farm, the goal is a vertically integrated elderberry farmbuisness. We have been working hard on our business plan, and now it's time to plant the bushes into my creamy field. I would like to do this right and spend a money to put the best inputs into the ground before I plant my cuttings (yes cuttings - no roots yet). The university of Missouri says ideally elderberries would want a ph of 5.5-6.5. They also need to be in soil with ample sulphur and boron. Our soil is rich, deep, black, fertile looking and moist (subirrigated). Generally things grow really well including my sample strip of elderberries on the east side of my field, but my sample strip on the north edge of the field showed increasing chlorosis as you go west. What do y'all think I could add to amend this soil? Get the pH down, improve the sulphur (elemental S seems logical for this I was thinking 1200lbs per acre?) Should I be worried about the low Cl? Should I worry about the low nitrogen? The soil test was taken in late winter (canada here).... My field has never received any fertilisers other than cover crops tilled in for several years in a row, and I've never observed signs of nitrogen deficiency in plant growth! Right now there is a nice, dense cover crop of fall rye... Is it possible that the fall rye has taken up and locked all of the available N? Maybe enough will be released when it's tilled in before planting? Also maybe it's not advisable to boost the N too much before planting cuttings. After all they don't even have roots yet.  Here's the soil test from both halves of my field: http://imgur.com/a/IsRq2\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/food2/comments/66xvzu/starting_an_elderberry_farmbusiness/", "created_utc": 1492889797.0, "score": 5, "author": "jedidiahwiebe", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/food2/comments/66xvzu/starting_an_elderberry_farmbusiness/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Would you use a platform that connects home cooks with busy professionals for homemade meals?", "selftext": "Hi Reddit! I\u2019m working on a startup idea and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. The concept is to create a platform where talented home cooks can sell their homemade meals to working professionals who are looking for healthy, hygienic, and affordable food options.\n\n**The Problems:**\n\n* Busy 9-to-5 professionals and elders often struggle to find hygienic, homemade food that feels healthy and homely, with few restaurants meeting this need. They also don't have time to cook.\n* Many skilled cooks (men and women) can\u2019t start their own restaurants due to financial or other barriers, leaving their passion for cooking unfulfilled. Some end up in ordinary jobs or as homemakers, despite their talent.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\nA website/app where home cooks can register, share their location, and sell their homemade meals. The cooks are required to undergo a vetting process, including obtaining a food business license (such as FSSAI). Working professionals can browse, order, and pick up these meals from local cooks instead of relying on restaurants.\n\n**Problems Addressed:**\n\n**For buyers:**\n\n* Access to healthy, hygienic, and homely food that satisfies cravings and supports better health.\n* Convenient meal pickups on the way to work or the office.\n\n**For cooks:**\n\n* Start a small, affordable \"virtual restaurant\" with no upfront costs (no tables, chairs, space, or overproduction).\n* A chance to pursue their passion for cooking and earn income.\n* **Bonus:**\u00a0Likely cheaper than restaurant food and reduces waste by cooking to demand.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n* Would you use this platform as a cook or a buyer?\n* Do you see any potential issues or ways to make it better?\n* Have you ever wished for a service like this\u2014either to sell your cooking or to buy homemade meals?\n\nFurther details:\n\n* I am also planning to make a community-driven delivery system, where customers can deliver meal if they wish and will be rewarded with cashback and offers.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and insights!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/food2/comments/1jgz63z/would_you_use_a_platform_that_connects_home_cooks/", "created_utc": 1742613226.0, "score": 5, "author": "One-Composer-1819", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/food2/comments/1jgz63z/would_you_use_a_platform_that_connects_home_cooks/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Would you use a platform that connects home cooks with busy professionals for homemade meals?", "selftext": "Hi Reddit! I\u2019m working on a startup idea and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. The concept is to create a platform where talented home cooks can sell their homemade meals to working professionals who are looking for healthy, hygienic, and affordable food options.\n\n**The Problems:**\n\n* Busy 9-to-5 professionals and elders often struggle to find hygienic, homemade food that feels healthy and homely, with few restaurants meeting this need. They also don't have time to cook.\n* Many skilled cooks (men and women) can\u2019t start their own restaurants due to financial or other barriers, leaving their passion for cooking unfulfilled. Some end up in ordinary jobs or as homemakers, despite their talent.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\nA website/app where home cooks can register, share their location, and sell their homemade meals. The cooks are required to undergo a vetting process, including obtaining a food business license (such as FSSAI). Working professionals can browse, order, and pick up these meals from local cooks instead of relying on restaurants.\n\n**Problems Addressed:**\n\n**For buyers:**\n\n* Access to healthy, hygienic, and homely food that satisfies cravings and supports better health.\n* Convenient meal pickups on the way to work or the office.\n\n**For cooks:**\n\n* Start a small, affordable \"virtual restaurant\" with no upfront costs (no tables, chairs, space, or overproduction).\n* A chance to pursue their passion for cooking and earn income.\n* **Bonus:**\u00a0Likely cheaper than restaurant food and reduces waste by cooking to demand.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n* Would you use this platform as a cook or a buyer?\n* Do you see any potential issues or ways to make it better?\n* Have you ever wished for a service like this\u2014either to sell your cooking or to buy homemade meals?\n\nFurther details:\n\n* I am also planning to make a community-driven delivery system, where customers can deliver meal if they wish and will be rewarded with cashback and offers.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and insights!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/food2/comments/1jgz63z/would_you_use_a_platform_that_connects_home_cooks/", "created_utc": 1742613226.0, "score": 3, "author": "One-Composer-1819", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/food2/comments/1jgz63z/would_you_use_a_platform_that_connects_home_cooks/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Would you use a platform that connects home cooks with busy professionals for homemade meals?", "selftext": "Hi Reddit! I\u2019m working on a startup idea and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. The concept is to create a platform where talented home cooks can sell their homemade meals to working professionals who are looking for healthy, hygienic, and affordable food options.\n\n**The Problems:**\n\n* Busy 9-to-5 professionals and elders often struggle to find hygienic, homemade food that feels healthy and homely, with few restaurants meeting this need. They also don't have time to cook.\n* Many skilled cooks (men and women) can\u2019t start their own restaurants due to financial or other barriers, leaving their passion for cooking unfulfilled. Some end up in ordinary jobs or as homemakers, despite their talent.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\nA website/app where home cooks can register, share their location, and sell their homemade meals. The cooks are required to undergo a vetting process, including obtaining a food business license (such as FSSAI). Working professionals can browse, order, and pick up these meals from local cooks instead of relying on restaurants.\n\n**Problems Addressed:**\n\n**For buyers:**\n\n* Access to healthy, hygienic, and homely food that satisfies cravings and supports better health.\n* Convenient meal pickups on the way to work or the office.\n\n**For cooks:**\n\n* Start a small, affordable \"virtual restaurant\" with no upfront costs (no tables, chairs, space, or overproduction).\n* A chance to pursue their passion for cooking and earn income.\n* **Bonus:**\u00a0Likely cheaper than restaurant food and reduces waste by cooking to demand.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n* Would you use this platform as a cook or a buyer?\n* Do you see any potential issues or ways to make it better?\n* Have you ever wished for a service like this\u2014either to sell your cooking or to buy homemade meals?\n\nFurther details:\n\n* I am also planning to make a community-driven delivery system, where customers can deliver meal if they wish and will be rewarded with cashback and offers.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and insights!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/food2/comments/1jgz63z/would_you_use_a_platform_that_connects_home_cooks/", "created_utc": 1742613226.0, "score": 4, "author": "One-Composer-1819", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/food2/comments/1jgz63z/would_you_use_a_platform_that_connects_home_cooks/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
