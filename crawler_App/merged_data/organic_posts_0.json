{"title": "The biggest reason to go organic", "selftext": "Most people don't understand just how problematic synthetic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in conventional agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?  As these studies showcase, these pesticides, found in normal amounts in children, not children with high exposure, are implicated in reduced IQ and cognitive abilities:\n\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507778\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507776\n- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003160/\n- http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/05/17/peds.2009-3058.full.pdf+html\n- http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978\n\nTake a few minutes to ponder the ramifications; the food we eat may literally be making us dumber.  And yes, food is a major pesticide source despite what industry might claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18414640.  Continuing on, the most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a lot of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Guess which subpopulation scientists are beginning to find has significantly reduced paraoxanase activity?  People with autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297937 -- and this year a large study found associations between organophosphates and autism: http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978.  More work needs to be done on this front, but the early findings are concerning to say the least.\n\nThe data against organophosphates continues to pile up and has resulted in the thousands of scientists represented by the Union of Concerned Scientists wanting organophosphates banned.  Unfortunately, politics wins at the EPA: http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/epa-and-pesticides.html\n\nThere will be a time when society looks back in shame on its use of synthetic pesticides.  But make no mistake, the greed of chemical manufacturers and the cognitive dissonance of those who utilize these pesticides will result in unquantifiable damage before we get to that point.

{"title": "Request for feedback on my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals (x-post)", "selftext": "I recently finished reading Count Down ([https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1)) by Shanna H. Swan & Stacey Colino (2020) which is about how toxic chemicals including endocrine disrupting chemicals are damaging our health including our sexual health. I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.\n\nAfter reading the book I felt like a \"starter list\" would be best to focus on \"Do's & don't's\" as the easiest entry point. Then if people are interested enough, they can choose to take the next step of finding healthy natural organic alternatives.\n\nSo below is my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals. **I would love your feedback and critique if you have time. I am especially interested about whether any of my suggestions below are wrong or out of date.**\n\nThank you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Only use cleaning products that have ingredients you can identify e.g. water, vinegar, baking soda, essential oils. Look for home-made cleaner recipes online.\n* Don't use or purchase carpets, indoor mats, or rugs that are treated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Good alternatives to carpets include solid wood, tile, cork or natural linoleum flooring\n* If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials\n* When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.\n* Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets\n* Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors. Taking off your shoes will prevent tracking in dirt and pollutants.\n* Avoid stain or waterproofing treatments on your carpets\n* Vacuum all carpets and rugs thoroughly using a machine with a HEPA filter at least once a week\n* Don't use shoe polishes and carpet cleaners containing trichloroethylene (TCE)\n* Wipe surfaces of dust using a wet cloth or mop\n* Don't use plastic containers for food storage. Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or porcelain containers with tops or aluminium foil.\n* Never reheat food in plastic in the microwave. Transfer it to a plate or a bowl.\n* Don't use nonstick cookware. Switch to cast-iron pots & pans or stainless steel. Also consider ceramic, porcelain, anodized aluminium cookware, or glass bakeware.\n* Only drink water that has already been filtered for toxic chemicals & microplastics\n* Use glass or stainless steel for drink bottles\n* Avoid black plastic cooking utensils\n* Don't use a plastic reusable cup or a bamboo reusable cup. Choose a stainless steel, ceramic, porcelain or glass reusable cup.\n* Eat a home-cooked fresh food diet. Choose fresh ingredients such as loose fruit and loose vegetables. Buy from bulk stores where you can refill your own containers.\n* Buy organic seasonal locally-grown food\n* if you are unable to buy organic food 100% of the time, avoid eating non-organic products which contain the highest amounts of pesticide residues such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples\n* Avoid packaged food or drink such as plastic bottles, food wrapped in plastic wrap, takeaways in fast food containers, food packaged in greaseproof lining, canned foods, packaging labelled with recycling codes 3 or 7\n* Reduce your consumption of canned food\n* Don't eat fast food\n* Don't eat microwave popcorn\n* Don't drink out of cans\n* To avoid exposure to dioxins (a harmful chemical) eat a vegan diet. More than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish.\n* If you do want to eat meat, avoid processed meat. Choose hormone-free beef and hormone-free dairy.\n* If you do want to eat fish, choose fish with the lowest toxic chemical content\n* Use period products that are plastic-free, unscented, and labelled \"totally chlorine free (TCF)\"\n* Where possible use reusable period products such as silicon cups, reusable pads, reusable tampon applicators, and period pants/period underwear\n* Don't use anti-mold paints in the home\n* Don't wear face masks and other personal protective equipment containing nanographene and other nanoparticles\n* Buy non-toxic sunscreen and non-toxic baby sunscreen\n* Buy children's toys that are labelled phthalate-free, PVC-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and BPF-free\n* Avoid children's toys that smell strongly of chemicals or are heavily scented.\n* Avoid soft plastic children's toys, as these can contain endocrine disruptors like phthalates.\n* Choose natural rubber children's toys\n* If a children's toy is painted or treated with varnish or other coatings, make sure it is non-toxic, free from lead, and meant for children\n* When furnishing the playroom, include natural materials whenever possible. Choose wooden tables and chairs, with cushions if desired, and baskets, rather than plastic bins, to hold children's toys and art supplies\n* Unpack any new children's toy and leave it outdoors to let some of the hazardous chemicals evaporating\n* Buy solid wooden children's toys with as few glued parts as possible\n* Buy unvarnished and painted children's toys wherever possible or watch out for non-toxic and natural finishes\n* Don't buy school uniforms that have PFAS-based stain resistance (check the labels before you buy)\n* Don't use face paint with toxic ingredients on children\n* Buy nappies that are chemical free. Opt for organic cotton, fragrance-free, and reusable nappies\n* Don't use personal care or beauty products that contain toxic chemicals. Buy certified 100% organic products packaged in glass or ceramic jars that are labelled paraben free, fragrance free, and perfume free.\n* Use PFAS-free dental floss\n* When buying abroad or online, be aware the same product can contain harmful chemicals depending on where you buy it\n* If you live outside the EU, choose products that are sold in the EU. The EU has the strictest chemical regulations in the world, and so these cosmetics may have fewer harmful chemicals in them.\n* Don't use nail varnish and nail remover\n* Don't purchase or use products with the ingredients 'fragrance' or 'parfum'\n* Don't use vinyl shower curtains\n* Don't use scented candles or antibacterial soap\n* Don't use air fresheners\n* Purchase items & products that are free of PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and other harmful plastics\n* Buy products free of free of flame-retardant chemicals and toxic adhesives (such as those containing formaldehyde)\n* Choose natural-wood tables and cabinets that are made without synthetic wood or particleboard\n* Buy organic-cotton mattress pads, not ones with the plastic barriers that will release their own chemicals into the air\n* Don't buy clothes that are treated with fluorinated chemicals called PFAS to make them waterproof or stain resistant\n* Don't use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers\n* Use organic fertiliser (home-made or store-bought) e.g. use grass clippings as fertiliser on your lawn\n* Avoid handling till receipts as much as possible\n* Don't put till receipts in the recycling bin \u2013 because they can contaminate the entire recycling stream\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Check suspect ingredients in hair sprays, nail polishes, hair dyes, shampoos, body wash products, body creams, moisturisers, make-ups, soaps, lipsticks, deodorants, antiperspirants, cleaning products, and fragrances against the SIN List ([https://sinlist.chemsec.org/](https://sinlist.chemsec.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As a rule it's best to avoid products labelled as having anti-microbial properties\n* Use mobile apps to identify toxic chemicals: In Germany, France and the UK, you can use apps to identify cosmetics containing chemicals that you should avoid. In Germany, use Tox Fox, in France use Clean Beauty, and in the UK try Giki Badges ([https://badges.giki.earth/](https://badges.giki.earth/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit (2021-05-20): Fixing the Giki Badges URL)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/ncdjf2/request_for_feedback_on_my_starter_list_of_ways/", "created_utc": 1621011916.0, "score": 32, "author": "dave-underwood", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/ncdjf2/request_for_feedback_on_my_starter_list_of_ways/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The primary reason organic is so important.", "selftext": "Most people don't understand just how problematic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?  As these studies showcase, these pesticides, found in normal amounts in children, not children with high exposure, are implicated in reduced IQ and cognitive abilities:\n\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507776\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507778\n- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003160/\n\nThink about this.  The food we eat may literally be making us dumber.  But it gets worse...\n\nThe most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a LOT of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Others have less activity and might see reduced IQ and cognitive abilities.  Guess which subpopulation has the least amount of paraoxanase activity?  People with autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297937 -- and sure enough, this year the following study came out implicating organophosphates and autism: http://news.yahoo.com/study-links-pesticide-exposure-pregnancy-autism-123742370.html", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/2jfmt0/the_primary_reason_organic_is_so_important/", "created_utc": 1413479721.0, "score": 20, "author": "TheYogi", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/2jfmt0/the_primary_reason_organic_is_so_important/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Study shows organic beekeeping as efficient as conventional", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nPenn State University researchers are among the first to take a comprehensive look at the long-term impact of organic honey bee pollination versus traditional methods. The study lasted three years, and the results were quite favorable for organic.\n\nThe team was made up of researchers and thirty experienced beekeepers. They tracked 300 honey bee populations on eight certified organic farms in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The scientists would listen to the beekeepers and the results. This would ensure that the study captured beekeepers' day-to-day challenges outside of a controlled environment. The beekeepers and the scientists were providing each other feedback.\n\nColonies were placed in one of the following categories: conventional management, organic management, and chemical-free management. The main difference between the groups is that hobbyists prefer chemical-free, while organic beekeepers generally intervene as little as possible. Most large-scale honeybee operations often intervene with chemicals and supplements to keep colonies alive.\n\nThe results for organic and conventional systems were almost identical. Both increased winter survival by 180%. There were no major survival issues between the two. Honey production was up 118% for organic and 102% for conventional. Parasites and pathogen levels were not materially different.\n\nThe results for organic production are promising. The scientists noted that the colonies' products could not be marketed as certified organic because this requires a 3-kilometer pesticide-free zone around the colonies. This is challenging to create in actual world production. Is this an area that can be addressed in the future?\n\nSource: Easy Newz Mobile App", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/13zdyrl/study_shows_organic_beekeeping_as_efficient_as/", "created_utc": 1685801219.0, "score": 16, "author": "EasyNewzApp", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/13zdyrl/study_shows_organic_beekeeping_as_efficient_as/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I'd love to ask you some questions!", "selftext": "I've been bitten by the organic bug and have decided this is what I would like to devote my life to.  I have a fair amount of education and business experience but none of this revolves around agriculture.  I would like to spend this year building a business plan for a camp in Arizona that would begin as a small sustainable organic farm and expand into a destination location that would provide camping, hunting, education, career paths and a few other things as well.\n\nI feel entirely capable of finding both the land and investors for such an undertaking but have a LOT of catching up to do in regards to the actual mechanics of the operation.  To give you a little background I have two main objectives here which I will outline below.  If this seems interesting to you and you would be willing to devote some time to provide me with a little education I would be very grateful.\n\n**To use a small but profitable sustainable organic farm as a stepping stone to expand a business.** The major benefit here other than the obvious is to document the process and use it as a media piece to show others that it is both rewarding and possible.  In my experience as a consumer of organic products I feel that the industrialization even of organic produce is not the solution we need.  Yes it will certainly play its part and it is important as a nation and world that we move away from dangerous chemical and genetically modified production, but most importantly SUSTAINABLE and LOCAL practices must be part of the mental shift.  I would like to help illustrate this by providing a \"If I Can Do It, So Can You\" example for others.  \n\n**To provide education to those who otherwise may not be seeking it out.**  By using the organic farm as a \"base of operations\" for other business ventures I hope to draw in a crowd of people that usually would scoff at the organic movement.  In Arizona this is generally the \"right wing\" costco shopper that spends as little as they can on food and as much as they can on their new truck.  No judgement here, that was me a year ago.  If people could come to this location, rent a cabin and be provided with delicious sustainable organic meals, breathe the fresh air and witness firsthand the physical and psychological benefits, I might actually have a chance at \"winning their hearts and minds\".\n\nThis idea is still in its infancy and is certainly subject to change and influence, thats where you come in.  I will give you an idea of what in my uneducated opinion would be a good start and if you could offer suggestions or warnings that would be awesome.\n\nBuy 30-40 acres of land with a small farmhouse and decent water rights.\n\nPlant a 5 acre orchard (thinking apples?) with adjoining pasture.\n\nUse a few dairy cows or a fair amount of goats to clear the orchard and pasture.\n\nUse free range chickens to cut down on pest insects.\n\nUse a few pigs to consume the fruit not suited for sale.\n\nStart farming organic produce on an acre or two using fertilizer generated from the livestock.\n\nBuild a few small prefab cabins on the property and begin renting them out.\n\nEncourage survival/outdoors/hunting/backpacking experts to use my location as a venue for their classes by providing reasonable rates and the added benefit of free meals.\n\nFrom there I could head in a few directions but first I need to make the farm pay for itself, provide extra for guests and generate profit for expansion.  I need to first learn more about the financial nature of organic farming though.  I would be providing my own labor but this would not be enough and I would have to hire some help to get started and then maintain the farm.  I have a lot of friends who would be very excited and happy to come up on weekends and participate but I have to just count that as a bonus.  \n\nSo here are a few questions I have but im sure there are a million I dont even know to ask.  Feel free to participate as you see fit.\n\nNot counting land, how much did it cost you to begin operating your farm?  At what point did you get out of the red with your operation?  How many people do you feed from your produce?  What has been your greatest challenge so far?  If you could do it all over again what would you change? How many people work for you and what/how do you pay them?  Do you have any people that live on your land in exchange for labor?  What kind of livestock do you have and how much of their feed comes from your land?\n\nWell this post is already a short novel so i'll cut it off there.  Thanks in advance for any advice/help!\n\n**EDIT:**  I appreciate the upvotes but also feel free to throw in your two cents even if you are not an \"expert\".  I realize I might be getting my hopes up too much that someone with this kind of experience will see my post.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/u92yw/hello_are_there_any_profitable_sustainable/", "created_utc": 1338232128.0, "score": 17, "author": "whathassciencedone", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/u92yw/hello_are_there_any_profitable_sustainable/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I want to tell you guys about a conventional farming practice called 'dessication'", "selftext": "So as a organic farmer living in a 'conventional' farming community (in western canada) I see the 'farming practices' these guys use on a regular basis. Now you all are likely aware that conventionally grown crops are sprayed several time throughout the growing season to combat things like weeds, insects, fungus, etc. but no one really speaks about a process called 'desiccation'. Basically what this process is, when the crop is almost ready to harvest they go out and spray a chemical on it to ensure the entire field is ready to harvest all at once in a 'efficient and uniform' way.... this is done on pretty much all cereal crops (except malting barley), several oil seed crops (eg, flax), legume crops (lentils, beans, peas). This is a fairly new practice (less then 10 years old), it eliminates the need to 'swath' the crop (the way it was done for 100s of years, and still done by organic farmers) to ultimately save time/money. I believe it puts a significant health risk into our food. The chemical is sprayed DAYS before the crop is harvested, it is also a concern that the crop absorbs some of the chemical that is applied during the desiccation process. These are not nice chemicals, one of the common ones that is used for desiccation is roundup (im sure your familiar with this chemical) another common one is 'Reglone' if you look at the MSDS sheet for reglone it states \"Symptoms of Acute Exposure\nMay cause eye irritation. Harmful if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the skin.\" Please feel free to google 'reglone msds' to see the harmful effects the chemical has on the human body...\n\nNow there are people that will say the chemicals are applied at such a low rate they're not a health concern. However there is no one monitoring how much a farmer is putting on his field, other then the farmer (or corporation) himself. And truth be told, there is very little testing done to ensure these 'maximum residue limits' are enforced. \n\nThe reason I am telling you this is to get the word out there... i've been 'preaching' about this for several years to 'city folk' and no one had any clue something like this was going on. If anyone has any questions please post here and i'll try and do my best to answer them.

Over 90% of their products are not organic, you can find GMO's on just about every shelf.\n2. The produce section is a haven for pesticides.\n3. Their organic produce section is one of the smallest sections in the store, none of it locally sourced.\n4. They acquire real organic stores and then turn them into just another store to buy more poisoned food.\n5. They refuse to take the initiative to label GMO foods, that would be bad for profits.\n6. Their cage free eggs are not cage free, there are no real mass produced cage free eggs.\n7. They  are not a \"Farmers Market\", they are just another grocery store that  sells poisonous products from all over the world produced by people  making less than slave wages.\n\nWhat  Sprouts is doing is incredibly deceitful and dangerous. People load up  their carts with what they think are safe and healthy foods, they are  not. I walked out of the store a few weeks ago after I realized what  they were really selling. I went to Von's, a chain store, and purchased  my real organic products and paid a whole lot less. You will find far  more organic food at just about any large grocery store than you will  find at Sprouts.

{"title": "Organic vs. Non-organic chicken breast", "selftext": "We're a family of 4 who eats almost entirely organic. All our meat/eggs/milk is also organic, and we're a physically active family that eats a higher-than-average protein intake (i.e. I eat animal protein with every meal). We're also located in Canada, where grocery prices have skyrocketed relative to incomes in the past 3-4 years.\n\nI'm scrutinizing our grocery budget and contemplating places to trim. I'm curious if non-organic chicken breast is a relatively safe substitution for organic chicken breast. My thinking is that animals store toxins, chemicals, pesticides, metals, etc. in their adipose tissue (like humans), and factory-farmed diets would also alter the fatty acid composition of animal fat heavily towards omega-6.

However, I've noticed the labels on many different meats from many different farms are always variations of the same thing, worded slightly differently.

The land has been in her family for 95 years and has operated as a vegetable and flower farm with a roadside stand the entire time. We\u2019d like to continue the tradition, but we need some guidance, as we also found out that it barely breaks even. \n\n\nWe run the flower operation on 1/4 of an acre, while relatives grow produce on six acres. The operations are separate in terms of space and accounting, which is how we were blindsided by the lack of profits on the produce side. Our flowers are profitable.\n\n\nThe farm has never grown fruit, had animals, or even compost. For having only six farmable acres, the farm has been run conventionally without a thought given to long-term sustainability. For example, the soil is literally sand, tilled to the fine texture of a beach. Flowers and weeds grow well, but produce gets blossom end rot or does not reach full potential. \n\n\nAdditional info, features, and concerns:\n\n\n\n* We are in Wisconsin, zone 5b\n* We are both 41 and have three kids under 8\n* The property is a long rectangle, 300 feet east to west, 1300 feet north to south\n* Suburban-type houses are on all sides, comprising 22 adjacent neighbors\n* No irrigation \n* On a well, no city water or sewage \n* No fences, so deer and rabbits are constant problems\n* Thrips, aphids, Japanese beetles, horn worms, and cabbage moth worms are constant problems \n* There\u2019s a uninhabited single-story frame house with two beds/one bath built in 1890 that has a mold problem that can be smelled from outside \n* There\u2019s a two car garage built in the 1950s that raccoons made their home in for many years\n* There\u2019s a pole barn built in 1960s that has a dirt floor, a caved in roof, and a sliding door that won\u2019t shut\n* There are five 48-foot long hoop houses (currently used to store tools and tractors)\n* 2 acres of forest\n* A section of a several mile long ravine runs west to east on the back side of property through the forested area\n* There\u2019s a 1986 John Deere 900HC tractor\n\n\nThis seems to be golden opportunity to create a proper farmstead\u2014as in living there, putting things right, and making money; however, we don\u2019t have much to spend and it can\u2019t take decades. \n\n\nSo, I am looking for detailed guides that specify low-cost, straightforward steps that will allow us to turn this worn-out land into something green, profitable, and beautiful.

{"title": "Study shows organic beekeeping as efficient as conventional", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nPenn State University researchers are among the first to take a comprehensive look at the long-term impact of organic honey bee pollination versus traditional methods. The study lasted three years, and the results were quite favorable for organic.\n\nThe team was made up of researchers and thirty experienced beekeepers. They tracked 300 honey bee populations on eight certified organic farms in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The scientists would listen to the beekeepers and the results. This would ensure that the study captured beekeepers' day-to-day challenges outside of a controlled environment. The beekeepers and the scientists were providing each other feedback.\n\nColonies were placed in one of the following categories: conventional management, organic management, and chemical-free management. The main difference between the groups is that hobbyists prefer chemical-free, while organic beekeepers generally intervene as little as possible. Most large-scale honeybee operations often intervene with chemicals and supplements to keep colonies alive.\n\nThe results for organic and conventional systems were almost identical. Both increased winter survival by 180%. There were no major survival issues between the two. Honey production was up 118% for organic and 102% for conventional. Parasites and pathogen levels were not materially different.\n\nThe results for organic production are promising. The scientists noted that the colonies' products could not be marketed as certified organic because this requires a 3-kilometer pesticide-free zone around the colonies. This is challenging to create in actual world production. Is this an area that can be addressed in the future?\n\nSource: Easy Newz Mobile App", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/13zdyrl/study_shows_organic_beekeeping_as_efficient_as/", "created_utc": 1685801219.0, "score": 20, "author": "EasyNewzApp", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/13zdyrl/study_shows_organic_beekeeping_as_efficient_as/", "html_title": ""}

These grants can be used for various supply chain or production improvements, from processing to capacity to developing new consumer-facing products.\n\nSecond, the USDA has raised the cost share amount under the Organic Certification Cost Share Program or OCCSP.

{"title": "Organic food for health, TCM and wholistic view", "selftext": "I was replying to a TCM question regarding organic food choices and I thought that the reply might be of interest to others who are following or deciding to follow organic diet and make healthier food choice in life. Here is goes:\n\nNon-organic food (especially in worst cases of non-organic gardening) is grown either without soil or in soil fed with artificial fertilizers, slime, chemical compounds, factory wastes that haven't been broken down by the earth and its microflora. The result is the big blown and often imperishable and tasteless (apart from sweetness) vegetables that are partially made from indigestible, non-living matter. On top of that, the inorganic matter in them is often charged with toxins and unstable, polluted energy accumulated during growth, harvesting, storage, production and transportation.\n\nOur digestive system doesn't have the capacity to break down non-living matter, as the result, the spleen runs out of Qi trying to separate those little bits that are digestible, while the rest goes into waste and is deposited as dampness and phlegm in the body, because the body doesn't have enough energy to evacuate all that waste.\n\nAny active toxic substances, pesticides, chemicals, irradiation etc. accumulated in that non-organic food, cannot be just let alone and moved out from the body as is, as they are too volatile. They have to be enveloped into a thick Yin layer of Damp first. As the Spleen becomes Qi deficient and unable to cope with all that waste, and it would damage the body if the Spleen tries to separate those toxins from the matter, they just get deposited in the body until better times come, usually starting around the waist and hip area and spreading into other vital organs and then the rest of the body. We might be eating more but we keep depleting our life energy and create blockages in energetic pathways as well as in bodily liquid circulations.\n\nThe large intestine suffers the most perhaps, as all those inorganic deposits create a thick layer around its walls preventing healthy energy and blood circulation, building a perfect environment for unhealthy, non-human beneficial microflora to thrive within it. As its function weakens, all body organs suffer from being unable to fully cleanse and restore their functions. The wastes in the large intestine become reabsorbed by the body as its energy to contain and eliminate the waste efficiently is compromised.\n\nThe further it goes the worse it gets until we start carefully looking onto what we eat and how much, and listen to our body response to all that.\n\nWhen that unhealthy inorganic microflora in our guts and organs accumulates to a substantial degree, it has the power to influence our body and mind, thoughts and desires, creating cravings and needs that would continuously feed that microflora and that would reduce the healing, restorative powers of the body, mostly through direction of all the energy away from the body and into the brain through all sorts of external or internal stimuli, suppression of body emotions and expressions and through consuming unhealthy food and information.\n\nWe want to make sure that the Yin we nourish our body with and the Yang that gives it vital animating energy, both are balanced and come from the cleanest, natural sources, grown with love and care for the planet and humanity. When we eat, we need to lower our mind into the abdominal area, not superficially checking on it here and there, but steadily keeping it in the lower body. When we see colors and taste flavors of the food, we need to be able to connect, without thinking, comparing or judging, these flavors, aromas and colors with the feeling we get from the body. Eating like that we will know intuitively what and when our body needs, to stay healthy and vibrant.\n\nI hope it is helpful and is not completely out of the context!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/s9offs/organic_food_for_health_tcm_and_wholistic_view/", "created_utc": 1642808484.0, "score": 2, "author": "AlMaxim", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/s9offs/organic_food_for_health_tcm_and_wholistic_view/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Request for feedback on my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals (x-post)", "selftext": "I recently finished reading Count Down ([https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1)) by Shanna H. Swan & Stacey Colino (2020) which is about how toxic chemicals including endocrine disrupting chemicals are damaging our health including our sexual health. I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.\n\nAfter reading the book I felt like a \"starter list\" would be best to focus on \"Do's & don't's\" as the easiest entry point. Then if people are interested enough, they can choose to take the next step of finding healthy natural organic alternatives.\n\nSo below is my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals. **I would love your feedback and critique if you have time. I am especially interested about whether any of my suggestions below are wrong or out of date.**\n\nThank you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Only use cleaning products that have ingredients you can identify e.g. water, vinegar, baking soda, essential oils. Look for home-made cleaner recipes online.\n* Don't use or purchase carpets, indoor mats, or rugs that are treated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Good alternatives to carpets include solid wood, tile, cork or natural linoleum flooring\n* If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials\n* When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.\n* Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets\n* Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors. Taking off your shoes will prevent tracking in dirt and pollutants.\n* Avoid stain or waterproofing treatments on your carpets\n* Vacuum all carpets and rugs thoroughly using a machine with a HEPA filter at least once a week\n* Don't use shoe polishes and carpet cleaners containing trichloroethylene (TCE)\n* Wipe surfaces of dust using a wet cloth or mop\n* Don't use plastic containers for food storage. Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or porcelain containers with tops or aluminium foil.\n* Never reheat food in plastic in the microwave. Transfer it to a plate or a bowl.\n* Don't use nonstick cookware. Switch to cast-iron pots & pans or stainless steel. Also consider ceramic, porcelain, anodized aluminium cookware, or glass bakeware.\n* Only drink water that has already been filtered for toxic chemicals & microplastics\n* Use glass or stainless steel for drink bottles\n* Avoid black plastic cooking utensils\n* Don't use a plastic reusable cup or a bamboo reusable cup. Choose a stainless steel, ceramic, porcelain or glass reusable cup.\n* Eat a home-cooked fresh food diet. Choose fresh ingredients such as loose fruit and loose vegetables. Buy from bulk stores where you can refill your own containers.\n* Buy organic seasonal locally-grown food\n* if you are unable to buy organic food 100% of the time, avoid eating non-organic products which contain the highest amounts of pesticide residues such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples\n* Avoid packaged food or drink such as plastic bottles, food wrapped in plastic wrap, takeaways in fast food containers, food packaged in greaseproof lining, canned foods, packaging labelled with recycling codes 3 or 7\n* Reduce your consumption of canned food\n* Don't eat fast food\n* Don't eat microwave popcorn\n* Don't drink out of cans\n* To avoid exposure to dioxins (a harmful chemical) eat a vegan diet. More than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish.\n* If you do want to eat meat, avoid processed meat. Choose hormone-free beef and hormone-free dairy.\n* If you do want to eat fish, choose fish with the lowest toxic chemical content\n* Use period products that are plastic-free, unscented, and labelled \"totally chlorine free (TCF)\"\n* Where possible use reusable period products such as silicon cups, reusable pads, reusable tampon applicators, and period pants/period underwear\n* Don't use anti-mold paints in the home\n* Don't wear face masks and other personal protective equipment containing nanographene and other nanoparticles\n* Buy non-toxic sunscreen and non-toxic baby sunscreen\n* Buy children's toys that are labelled phthalate-free, PVC-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and BPF-free\n* Avoid children's toys that smell strongly of chemicals or are heavily scented.\n* Avoid soft plastic children's toys, as these can contain endocrine disruptors like phthalates.\n* Choose natural rubber children's toys\n* If a children's toy is painted or treated with varnish or other coatings, make sure it is non-toxic, free from lead, and meant for children\n* When furnishing the playroom, include natural materials whenever possible. Choose wooden tables and chairs, with cushions if desired, and baskets, rather than plastic bins, to hold children's toys and art supplies\n* Unpack any new children's toy and leave it outdoors to let some of the hazardous chemicals evaporating\n* Buy solid wooden children's toys with as few glued parts as possible\n* Buy unvarnished and painted children's toys wherever possible or watch out for non-toxic and natural finishes\n* Don't buy school uniforms that have PFAS-based stain resistance (check the labels before you buy)\n* Don't use face paint with toxic ingredients on children\n* Buy nappies that are chemical free. Opt for organic cotton, fragrance-free, and reusable nappies\n* Don't use personal care or beauty products that contain toxic chemicals.

I was shocked, I\u2019ve never been allergic to anything how can I be all of a sudden allergic to every nut there is and even grass when I\u2019m a soccer player ?!! It got so bad that I felt dizzy and felt like I couldn\u2019t get up for 10 days. Then I saw the doctor and she said I had acid reflux and that I shouldn\u2019t worry and it\u2019s completely normal. At this point I was like WHAT THE HELL why am I getting such bad health problems when I\u2019m only 21. I dugged deeper into why my health was getting so bad and I realized it was because of eating processed toxic foods that caused my acid reflux and allergies. Then covid hit and I got back home to eating my moms cooking. Now I barely have acid reflux symptoms and I\u2019m doing okay. But this ignited a passion that in me to end this horrid toxic food and to help people to preserve their health and not have to go through horrific bad health experiences like I have. This toxic food turned a completely healthy young adult like me to a person with a lifelong disease like acid reflux. So I started Green Club a website where we only sell non-toxic organic food! No artificial bad stuff! As I go on this journey to encourage people about eating good organic food, I\u2019d like to you to join in too! If you support me and my cause shop greenclub.io it shows that just like me you care about your health and only want the best for yourself. After all food can either be a slow poison or a healing medicine!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/kmalap/why_i_started_an_organic_company/", "created_utc": 1609231235.0, "score": 5, "author": "Most-Stay-823", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/kmalap/why_i_started_an_organic_company/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "What Are The Facts You Should Know About Organic Weed Prevention?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nAn alternative to conventional gardening is organic weed prevention. But the question of why you should do organic things is still up in the air.\n\nA garden is a lovely thing to have. It also provides an area for rest and refreshment, aside from the fact that it adds splendor to your place. Similarly, a vegetable garden is also helpful. It can not only offer additional income; it can also enhance the health of your family.\n\nThere are many reasons why you'd like your yard to have a garden. It doesn't matter what kind, as long as the stuff you want from it is there. Yet again, although you have managed to have an attractive lawn, you may encounter some issues.\n\nWeeds are only one of the few problems you may encounter with gardening. They are undesirable grasses that can grow on your lawn anywhere. While some of them may look beautiful, it is not recommended to raise them with your plants, though.\n\nDifferent ways of killing weeds exist. You can purchase weed spray, fertilizer for grass killer, or follow organic weed prevention. Although there may be effective lawn weed killers, some of them are still discouraged.\n\nThe best and most advisable way to kill weed so far is by preventing organic weed. Rather than chemicals, it is merely the use of organic weed preventers. But why go for an option like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here are some of the reasons why you should consider killing unwanted grass in your garden in an organic way:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1)** Be an active ecologist. Due to its relevance to anti-pollution and soil pollution, the main reason why organic living is promoted is. That is why your most significant contribution to the most important and most prominent campaign of our time is to use natural products.\n\n**2)** Your plants' healthy soil. If there is one thing in your garden that you have to take care of, that would be the soil. To grow beautiful and healthy plants, it is essential to have healthy soil.\n\n**3)** When too many chemicals are put into it, the soil's natural nutrients are depleted. Weed roundup when this occurs; unhealthy plants and crops and unattractive flowers are all you'll have.\n\n**4)** On the other hand, you can be sure that controlling unwanted grass will no longer be an issue when you have healthy soil. This is because some of their growth will be able to control the plants.\n\n**5)** Avoid risks to health. Conventional fertilizers are packed with hazardous chemicals for our health. People exposed to these chemicals may develop ailments attributed to the use of these chemical weed killers in the long run.\n\n**6)** Support from the government. Nowadays, because organic living is highly recommended and encouraged by governments and international organizations, you can only expect it to be beneficial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, to market your products, you don't have to spend too much money. Governments are allocating budgets to the marketing of organic products and products. That is why they purchase them whenever people see organic products.\n\nMoreover, governments are now providing areas where [organic products](https://www.saansmart.com/) are displayed in supermarkets and other market areas. They sometimes even encourage those businesses and farms that use organic products. Because of this, individuals would quickly know which item to buy and where to buy it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/k3fbno/what_are_the_facts_you_should_know_about_organic/", "created_utc": 1606677413.0, "score": 2, "author": "saansmart", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/k3fbno/what_are_the_facts_you_should_know_about_organic/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "\"Organic\" and other terminology on meat labels", "selftext": "I was vegan for 13 years so I know NOTHING about meat. However, due to health reasons, I had to switch back to an omnivorous diet a couple months ago. For both health and ethical reasons, I am trying to buy my meat from local farms only. I live in a very large US city and have a few farms relatively close by that I get deliveries from. However, I've noticed the labels on many different meats from many different farms are always variations of the same thing, worded slightly differently. I.e.:\n\n\"No antibiotics, no hormones, vegetarian fed\"\n\n\"No antibiotics ever\"\n\n\"No added solutions or injections\"\n\n\"Never administered antibiotics\"\n\n\"Non GMO project verified\"\n\n\"Never treated with rBST*\" \n\nI know a lot of these phrases are mainly differentiated between poultry/other meats. But why would something that's not treated with any sort of hormones, antibiotics, or injections, and is 100% grass fed, not be non-GMO or organic labeled?

{"title": "Seeking advice to revive a century-old family farm", "selftext": "My wife and I found out today, August 8, 2023, that we will inherit an eight-plus acre property in November. The land has been in her family for 95 years and has operated as a vegetable and flower farm with a roadside stand the entire time. We\u2019d like to continue the tradition, but we need some guidance, as we also found out that it barely breaks even. \n\n\nWe run the flower operation on 1/4 of an acre, while relatives grow produce on six acres. The operations are separate in terms of space and accounting, which is how we were blindsided by the lack of profits on the produce side. Our flowers are profitable.\n\n\nThe farm has never grown fruit, had animals, or even compost. For having only six farmable acres, the farm has been run conventionally without a thought given to long-term sustainability. For example, the soil is literally sand, tilled to the fine texture of a beach. Flowers and weeds grow well, but produce gets blossom end rot or does not reach full potential. \n\n\nAdditional info, features, and concerns:\n\n\n\n* We are in Wisconsin, zone 5b\n* We are both 41 and have three kids under 8\n* The property is a long rectangle, 300 feet east to west, 1300 feet north to south\n* Suburban-type houses are on all sides, comprising 22 adjacent neighbors\n* No irrigation \n* On a well, no city water or sewage \n* No fences, so deer and rabbits are constant problems\n* Thrips, aphids, Japanese beetles, horn worms, and cabbage moth worms are constant problems \n* There\u2019s a uninhabited single-story frame house with two beds/one bath built in 1890 that has a mold problem that can be smelled from outside \n* There\u2019s a two car garage built in the 1950s that raccoons made their home in for many years\n* There\u2019s a pole barn built in 1960s that has a dirt floor, a caved in roof, and a sliding door that won\u2019t shut\n* There are five 48-foot long hoop houses (currently used to store tools and tractors)\n* 2 acres of forest\n* A section of a several mile long ravine runs west to east on the back side of property through the forested area\n* There\u2019s a 1986 John Deere 900HC tractor\n\n\nThis seems to be golden opportunity to create a proper farmstead\u2014as in living there, putting things right, and making money; however, we don\u2019t have much to spend and it can\u2019t take decades. \n\n\nSo, I am looking for detailed guides that specify low-cost, straightforward steps that will allow us to turn this worn-out land into something green, profitable, and beautiful.

The study lasted three years, and the results were quite favorable for organic.\n\nThe team was made up of researchers and thirty experienced beekeepers. They tracked 300 honey bee populations on eight certified organic farms in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The scientists would listen to the beekeepers and the results. This would ensure that the study captured beekeepers' day-to-day challenges outside of a controlled environment. The beekeepers and the scientists were providing each other feedback.\n\nColonies were placed in one of the following categories: conventional management, organic management, and chemical-free management. The main difference between the groups is that hobbyists prefer chemical-free, while organic beekeepers generally intervene as little as possible. Most large-scale honeybee operations often intervene with chemicals and supplements to keep colonies alive.\n\nThe results for organic and conventional systems were almost identical. Both increased winter survival by 180%. There were no major survival issues between the two. Honey production was up 118% for organic and 102% for conventional. Parasites and pathogen levels were not materially different.\n\nThe results for organic production are promising. The scientists noted that the colonies' products could not be marketed as certified organic because this requires a 3-kilometer pesticide-free zone around the colonies. This is challenging to create in actual world production. Is this an area that can be addressed in the future?\n\nSource: Easy Newz Mobile App", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/13zdyrl/study_shows_organic_beekeeping_as_efficient_as/", "created_utc": 1685801219.0, "score": 17, "author": "EasyNewzApp", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/13zdyrl/study_shows_organic_beekeeping_as_efficient_as/", "html_title": ""}

The USDA listened to the challenges of reliance on imported organic feed and the time it takes to become certified organic. The recent turmoil and conflicts have shined an ever greater spotlight. Secretary Tom Vilsack announced a two-pronged approach to supporting and developing the domestic organic market to continue this rapid growth.\n\nFirst, the new Organic Market Development Grant (OMDG) Program will issue $75 million in competitive grants. These grants can be used for various supply chain or production improvements, from processing to capacity to developing new consumer-facing products.\n\nSecond, the USDA has raised the cost share amount under the Organic Certification Cost Share Program or OCCSP. This program helps organic producers cover organic certification costs.\n\n*\u201cAs USDA works to help make our nation\u2019s food system more resilient and create more options for producers and consumers, we recognize the important role the organic industry can play in expanding opportunities for value-added agriculture, strengthening supply chains, and generating revenue for farmers,\u201d Vilsack said. \u201cFor many farmers, the transition period before attaining organic certification can be cost-prohibitive, so USDA is also helping mitigate the risk involved for farmers who want to be able to grow and market organic crops.\u201d*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/13s7gm4/usdas_new_steps_to_support_organic_producers/", "created_utc": 1685090215.0, "score": 14, "author": "trader598", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/13s7gm4/usdas_new_steps_to_support_organic_producers/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Organic food for health, TCM and wholistic view", "selftext": "I was replying to a TCM question regarding organic food choices and I thought that the reply might be of interest to others who are following or deciding to follow organic diet and make healthier food choice in life. Here is goes:\n\nNon-organic food (especially in worst cases of non-organic gardening) is grown either without soil or in soil fed with artificial fertilizers, slime, chemical compounds, factory wastes that haven't been broken down by the earth and its microflora. The result is the big blown and often imperishable and tasteless (apart from sweetness) vegetables that are partially made from indigestible, non-living matter. On top of that, the inorganic matter in them is often charged with toxins and unstable, polluted energy accumulated during growth, harvesting, storage, production and transportation.\n\nOur digestive system doesn't have the capacity to break down non-living matter, as the result, the spleen runs out of Qi trying to separate those little bits that are digestible, while the rest goes into waste and is deposited as dampness and phlegm in the body, because the body doesn't have enough energy to evacuate all that waste.\n\nAny active toxic substances, pesticides, chemicals, irradiation etc. accumulated in that non-organic food, cannot be just let alone and moved out from the body as is, as they are too volatile. They have to be enveloped into a thick Yin layer of Damp first. As the Spleen becomes Qi deficient and unable to cope with all that waste, and it would damage the body if the Spleen tries to separate those toxins from the matter, they just get deposited in the body until better times come, usually starting around the waist and hip area and spreading into other vital organs and then the rest of the body. We might be eating more but we keep depleting our life energy and create blockages in energetic pathways as well as in bodily liquid circulations.\n\nThe large intestine suffers the most perhaps, as all those inorganic deposits create a thick layer around its walls preventing healthy energy and blood circulation, building a perfect environment for unhealthy, non-human beneficial microflora to thrive within it. As its function weakens, all body organs suffer from being unable to fully cleanse and restore their functions. The wastes in the large intestine become reabsorbed by the body as its energy to contain and eliminate the waste efficiently is compromised.\n\nThe further it goes the worse it gets until we start carefully looking onto what we eat and how much, and listen to our body response to all that.\n\nWhen that unhealthy inorganic microflora in our guts and organs accumulates to a substantial degree, it has the power to influence our body and mind, thoughts and desires, creating cravings and needs that would continuously feed that microflora and that would reduce the healing, restorative powers of the body, mostly through direction of all the energy away from the body and into the brain through all sorts of external or internal stimuli, suppression of body emotions and expressions and through consuming unhealthy food and information.\n\nWe want to make sure that the Yin we nourish our body with and the Yang that gives it vital animating energy, both are balanced and come from the cleanest, natural sources, grown with love and care for the planet and humanity. When we eat, we need to lower our mind into the abdominal area, not superficially checking on it here and there, but steadily keeping it in the lower body. When we see colors and taste flavors of the food, we need to be able to connect, without thinking, comparing or judging, these flavors, aromas and colors with the feeling we get from the body. Eating like that we will know intuitively what and when our body needs, to stay healthy and vibrant.\n\nI hope it is helpful and is not completely out of the context!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/s9offs/organic_food_for_health_tcm_and_wholistic_view/", "created_utc": 1642808484.0, "score": 1, "author": "AlMaxim", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/s9offs/organic_food_for_health_tcm_and_wholistic_view/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Request for feedback on my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals (x-post)", "selftext": "I recently finished reading Count Down ([https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1)) by Shanna H. Swan & Stacey Colino (2020) which is about how toxic chemicals including endocrine disrupting chemicals are damaging our health including our sexual health. I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.\n\nAfter reading the book I felt like a \"starter list\" would be best to focus on \"Do's & don't's\" as the easiest entry point. Then if people are interested enough, they can choose to take the next step of finding healthy natural organic alternatives.\n\nSo below is my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals. **I would love your feedback and critique if you have time. I am especially interested about whether any of my suggestions below are wrong or out of date.**\n\nThank you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Only use cleaning products that have ingredients you can identify e.g. water, vinegar, baking soda, essential oils. Look for home-made cleaner recipes online.\n* Don't use or purchase carpets, indoor mats, or rugs that are treated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Good alternatives to carpets include solid wood, tile, cork or natural linoleum flooring\n* If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials\n* When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.\n* Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets\n* Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors. Taking off your shoes will prevent tracking in dirt and pollutants.\n* Avoid stain or waterproofing treatments on your carpets\n* Vacuum all carpets and rugs thoroughly using a machine with a HEPA filter at least once a week\n* Don't use shoe polishes and carpet cleaners containing trichloroethylene (TCE)\n* Wipe surfaces of dust using a wet cloth or mop\n* Don't use plastic containers for food storage. Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or porcelain containers with tops or aluminium foil.\n* Never reheat food in plastic in the microwave. Transfer it to a plate or a bowl.\n* Don't use nonstick cookware. Switch to cast-iron pots & pans or stainless steel. Also consider ceramic, porcelain, anodized aluminium cookware, or glass bakeware.\n* Only drink water that has already been filtered for toxic chemicals & microplastics\n* Use glass or stainless steel for drink bottles\n* Avoid black plastic cooking utensils\n* Don't use a plastic reusable cup or a bamboo reusable cup. Choose a stainless steel, ceramic, porcelain or glass reusable cup.\n* Eat a home-cooked fresh food diet. Choose fresh ingredients such as loose fruit and loose vegetables. Buy from bulk stores where you can refill your own containers.\n* Buy organic seasonal locally-grown food\n* if you are unable to buy organic food 100% of the time, avoid eating non-organic products which contain the highest amounts of pesticide residues such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples\n* Avoid packaged food or drink such as plastic bottles, food wrapped in plastic wrap, takeaways in fast food containers, food packaged in greaseproof lining, canned foods, packaging labelled with recycling codes 3 or 7\n* Reduce your consumption of canned food\n* Don't eat fast food\n* Don't eat microwave popcorn\n* Don't drink out of cans\n* To avoid exposure to dioxins (a harmful chemical) eat a vegan diet. More than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish.\n* If you do want to eat meat, avoid processed meat. Choose hormone-free beef and hormone-free dairy.\n* If you do want to eat fish, choose fish with the lowest toxic chemical content\n* Use period products that are plastic-free, unscented, and labelled \"totally chlorine free (TCF)\"\n* Where possible use reusable period products such as silicon cups, reusable pads, reusable tampon applicators, and period pants/period underwear\n* Don't use anti-mold paints in the home\n* Don't wear face masks and other personal protective equipment containing nanographene and other nanoparticles\n* Buy non-toxic sunscreen and non-toxic baby sunscreen\n* Buy children's toys that are labelled phthalate-free, PVC-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and BPF-free\n* Avoid children's toys that smell strongly of chemicals or are heavily scented.\n* Avoid soft plastic children's toys, as these can contain endocrine disruptors like phthalates.\n* Choose natural rubber children's toys\n* If a children's toy is painted or treated with varnish or other coatings, make sure it is non-toxic, free from lead, and meant for children\n* When furnishing the playroom, include natural materials whenever possible. Choose wooden tables and chairs, with cushions if desired, and baskets, rather than plastic bins, to hold children's toys and art supplies\n* Unpack any new children's toy and leave it outdoors to let some of the hazardous chemicals evaporating\n* Buy solid wooden children's toys with as few glued parts as possible\n* Buy unvarnished and painted children's toys wherever possible or watch out for non-toxic and natural finishes\n* Don't buy school uniforms that have PFAS-based stain resistance (check the labels before you buy)\n* Don't use face paint with toxic ingredients on children\n* Buy nappies that are chemical free. Opt for organic cotton, fragrance-free, and reusable nappies\n* Don't use personal care or beauty products that contain toxic chemicals. Buy certified 100% organic products packaged in glass or ceramic jars that are labelled paraben free, fragrance free, and perfume free.\n* Use PFAS-free dental floss\n* When buying abroad or online, be aware the same product can contain harmful chemicals depending on where you buy it\n* If you live outside the EU, choose products that are sold in the EU. The EU has the strictest chemical regulations in the world, and so these cosmetics may have fewer harmful chemicals in them.\n* Don't use nail varnish and nail remover\n* Don't purchase or use products with the ingredients 'fragrance' or 'parfum'\n* Don't use vinyl shower curtains\n* Don't use scented candles or antibacterial soap\n* Don't use air fresheners\n* Purchase items & products that are free of PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and other harmful plastics\n* Buy products free of free of flame-retardant chemicals and toxic adhesives (such as those containing formaldehyde)\n* Choose natural-wood tables and cabinets that are made without synthetic wood or particleboard\n* Buy organic-cotton mattress pads, not ones with the plastic barriers that will release their own chemicals into the air\n* Don't buy clothes that are treated with fluorinated chemicals called PFAS to make them waterproof or stain resistant\n* Don't use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers\n* Use organic fertiliser (home-made or store-bought) e.g. use grass clippings as fertiliser on your lawn\n* Avoid handling till receipts as much as possible\n* Don't put till receipts in the recycling bin \u2013 because they can contaminate the entire recycling stream\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Check suspect ingredients in hair sprays, nail polishes, hair dyes, shampoos, body wash products, body creams, moisturisers, make-ups, soaps, lipsticks, deodorants, antiperspirants, cleaning products, and fragrances against the SIN List ([https://sinlist.chemsec.org/](https://sinlist.chemsec.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As a rule it's best to avoid products labelled as having anti-microbial properties\n* Use mobile apps to identify toxic chemicals: In Germany, France and the UK, you can use apps to identify cosmetics containing chemicals that you should avoid. In Germany, use Tox Fox, in France use Clean Beauty, and in the UK try Giki Badges ([https://badges.giki.earth/](https://badges.giki.earth/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit (2021-05-20): Fixing the Giki Badges URL)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/ncdjf2/request_for_feedback_on_my_starter_list_of_ways/", "created_utc": 1621011916.0, "score": 34, "author": "dave-underwood", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/ncdjf2/request_for_feedback_on_my_starter_list_of_ways/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Why I started an organic company", "selftext": "All my life I had been known as this super healthy child. I never got allergies never got hurt never had got sick or had colds not even stomachaches. Then I went to college I started eating out changed my diet completely by eating pizza fries and a lot of junk food. Basically the American diet which was eating a lot of processed and fried food. I used to have an Indian diet with an emphasis of lots of organic fresh fruits and veggies everyday with rice and naan thanks to my mom. I slowly started to see my health detoriating in college though. I developed allergies got a kidney infection twice and even got an allergic reaction so bad I had to be hospitalized overnight. The doctor at the ER said I should see an allergist. I did and the allergist said I was allergic to everything like grass to every kind of nut. I was shocked, I\u2019ve never been allergic to anything how can I be all of a sudden allergic to every nut there is and even grass when I\u2019m a soccer player ?!! It got so bad that I felt dizzy and felt like I couldn\u2019t get up for 10 days. Then I saw the doctor and she said I had acid reflux and that I shouldn\u2019t worry and it\u2019s completely normal. At this point I was like WHAT THE HELL why am I getting such bad health problems when I\u2019m only 21. I dugged deeper into why my health was getting so bad and I realized it was because of eating processed toxic foods that caused my acid reflux and allergies. Then covid hit and I got back home to eating my moms cooking. Now I barely have acid reflux symptoms and I\u2019m doing okay. But this ignited a passion that in me to end this horrid toxic food and to help people to preserve their health and not have to go through horrific bad health experiences like I have. This toxic food turned a completely healthy young adult like me to a person with a lifelong disease like acid reflux. So I started Green Club a website where we only sell non-toxic organic food! No artificial bad stuff! As I go on this journey to encourage people about eating good organic food, I\u2019d like to you to join in too! If you support me and my cause shop greenclub.io it shows that just like me you care about your health and only want the best for yourself.

{"title": "What Are The Facts You Should Know About Organic Weed Prevention?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nAn alternative to conventional gardening is organic weed prevention. But the question of why you should do organic things is still up in the air.\n\nA garden is a lovely thing to have. It also provides an area for rest and refreshment, aside from the fact that it adds splendor to your place. Similarly, a vegetable garden is also helpful. It can not only offer additional income; it can also enhance the health of your family.\n\nThere are many reasons why you'd like your yard to have a garden. It doesn't matter what kind, as long as the stuff you want from it is there. Yet again, although you have managed to have an attractive lawn, you may encounter some issues.\n\nWeeds are only one of the few problems you may encounter with gardening. They are undesirable grasses that can grow on your lawn anywhere. While some of them may look beautiful, it is not recommended to raise them with your plants, though.\n\nDifferent ways of killing weeds exist. You can purchase weed spray, fertilizer for grass killer, or follow organic weed prevention. Although there may be effective lawn weed killers, some of them are still discouraged.\n\nThe best and most advisable way to kill weed so far is by preventing organic weed. Rather than chemicals, it is merely the use of organic weed preventers. But why go for an option like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here are some of the reasons why you should consider killing unwanted grass in your garden in an organic way:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1)** Be an active ecologist. Due to its relevance to anti-pollution and soil pollution, the main reason why organic living is promoted is. That is why your most significant contribution to the most important and most prominent campaign of our time is to use natural products.\n\n**2)** Your plants' healthy soil. If there is one thing in your garden that you have to take care of, that would be the soil. To grow beautiful and healthy plants, it is essential to have healthy soil.\n\n**3)** When too many chemicals are put into it, the soil's natural nutrients are depleted. Weed roundup when this occurs; unhealthy plants and crops and unattractive flowers are all you'll have.\n\n**4)** On the other hand, you can be sure that controlling unwanted grass will no longer be an issue when you have healthy soil. This is because some of their growth will be able to control the plants.\n\n**5)** Avoid risks to health. Conventional fertilizers are packed with hazardous chemicals for our health. People exposed to these chemicals may develop ailments attributed to the use of these chemical weed killers in the long run.\n\n**6)** Support from the government. Nowadays, because organic living is highly recommended and encouraged by governments and international organizations, you can only expect it to be beneficial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, to market your products, you don't have to spend too much money. Governments are allocating budgets to the marketing of organic products and products. That is why they purchase them whenever people see organic products.\n\nMoreover, governments are now providing areas where [organic products](https://www.saansmart.com/) are displayed in supermarkets and other market areas. They sometimes even encourage those businesses and farms that use organic products. Because of this, individuals would quickly know which item to buy and where to buy it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/k3fbno/what_are_the_facts_you_should_know_about_organic/", "created_utc": 1606677413.0, "score": 3, "author": "saansmart", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/k3fbno/what_are_the_facts_you_should_know_about_organic/", "html_title": ""}
