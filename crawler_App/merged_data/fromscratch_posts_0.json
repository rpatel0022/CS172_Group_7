{"title": "Why you shouldn't Crowd your Pan, and How to Always Get Golden Brown Food", "selftext": "Hi r/fromscratch. Here's a culinary quick tip write up on how to get that golden brown (Maillard Reactions) deliciousness on your food. Super helpful for any cut of meat, especially more economical ones like chicken thighs, beef round, pork loin chops, etc. Also made a vid to show what I'm talking about.\n\n[Take a look here if interested.](https://youtu.be/6tfvAVP480w)\n\nThe whole reason we want Maillard Reactions/Browning is because of the crust/crispy like texture it provides and because it\u2019s a series of Reactions that we find more flavorful than plain grey meat. It DOES NOT lock in the juices, that is a myth. You can get a perfect golden brown sear on any meat then let it sit for a bit. After 5 minutes the surface of it will be wet from the juices inside of it. Therefore we aren\u2019t sealing in anything. It\u2019s the texture and flavor compounds that we want.\n\nIn order to get that golden brown crust on any food, it needs to reach a certain temperature. Upwards of 310F/154C. If you crowd the pan with food, then the moisture released will be much greater from that increased amount of food. This causes water to pool in the pan because it cannot evaporate out fast enough. Water in liquid form cannot get above 212F/100C, which is far below the temperature we need for the Maillard Reaction (good browning). So instead of searing, we end up boiling/steaming the meat and while it does cook this way, it will not get that Maillard Reaction browning we\u2019re aiming for.\n\nIn a non crowded pan, the water can evaporate because there\u2019s less of it and thus we can get to those high temperatures we need to good Maillard Browning. Below is a side by side comparison, non crowded on the left and crowded on the right. Notice the difference in color between the two. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifbo3afd2b371.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5dc624d68fa1a87d10db07904095134a27152d8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/nse5dl/why_you_shouldnt_crowd_your_pan_and_how_to_always/", "created_utc": 1622837103.0, "score": 144, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/nse5dl/why_you_shouldnt_crowd_your_pan_and_how_to_always/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I consider this to be \u201cItalian American\u201d style because of the amount of mozz. It was never served like this when I\u2019ve had it in Sorrento, but sometimes I crave the overindulgence of Italian American cooking. I also like to add some caciocavallo, another cheese made in southern Italy. \n\nGnocchi\n- 2/3 cup 00 flour\n- 2 large russets, baked\n- 1/2 large egg, whisked\n- 1/4 cup fresh ricotta, drained overnight\n- 1 tsp salt\nScoop out the potato flesh once cooled and put it through a ricer onto your work surface. Pour the egg, add the ricotta, sprinkle the salt, and sieve the flour over the whole thing. Bring together and knead just until a dough forms. The more you knead the more dense they will be. Cut off pieces and roll them out until they are about the diameter of a thick cigar. Cut into pillows. Boil in salted water and remove them as they float to the surface. For the Sorrentina, toss them in pomodoro sauce, add cheese, drizzle of EVOO, and bake @ 425\u00b0F until melted and starting to brown.

{"title": "I recreated a Banh Mi from my favorite Vietnamese bakery in Chicago.", "selftext": "Colonization is not tight, however in the case of Vietnam, a food-history-curious guy, such as myself, cannot overlook the cross-cultural delicacies French occupation brought to the country. Without the co-mingling of the Vietnamese and French people, we likely wouldn\u2019t have pho or banh mi. Crazy.\n\nThere's the delicate crunch and ultimate fluffiness from the Vietnamese baguette (much different than the French variety), a super flavorful main filling (in our case gorgeous Lemongrass chicken), crunchy aromatic vegetables and tangy, semi-sweet pickles AND NOT TO MENTION the rich, depth from a well-made pate.\n\nAll of the ingredients and technique are listed below. I also posted a how-to video if you prefer visuals. Let me know if you have any questions!\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Ingredients:\n\n500g Bread Flour\n\n5g Instant Yeast\n\n4g Sugar\n\n8g Kosher Salt\n\n345g Cold Water\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Technique:\n\n1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the bread flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt until homogenized. Pour in the cold water and mix with the paddle attachment for 1 minute. Replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook and knead for 10-20 minutes, until the dough passes the stretch test.\n2. Remove the dough from the mixer, shape it into a ball. Plop the dough into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest until doubled in size for 30 minutes to an hour.\n3. Grease your hands, then dump the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly greased work surface. Shape the dough into a large, 1 inch thick puck. Cut the dough like a pizza into 4 equal wedge-shaped triangular pieces like a pizza (280g each).\n4. Flatten the dough by hand, then roll from the top point down to the base of the triangle. Roll and press the dough down by the ends making sure to keep the middle fatter than the ends. Pinch the ends to seal, then continue rolling until smooth.\n5. Transfer the shaped baguettes to a baking tray lined with parchment, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes to an hour until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 500F, make sure it\u2019s preheated for at least 30 minutes before baking.\n6. Spray the baguettes with water, then make a long, deep slash running the length of the baguette. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. At the 12 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water, then close the oven. At the 9 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water again, rotate the baking sheets, then close the oven. At the 6 minute mark, spray again, then finally with 3 minutes remaining spray a final time. You will have baked a total of 15 minutes, and sprayed the baguettes 5 times. Be liberal with the water.\n7. Remove the baguettes from the oven and let cool completely on the baking sheets. The resulting loaf should be light, crispy, moist and cottony on the inside.\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Ingredients:\n\n1/2 pound Chicken Liver\n\n1/2 Yellow Onion, sliced thin\n\n1 Garlic clove, peeled and smashed\n\n1 tsp Chinese 5-Spice Powder\n\n1/2 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n1/2 cup Water\n\n1 1/2 sticks Unsalted Butter, room temperature and cut into 1/2 inch cubes.\n\n2 tsp Shaoxing Cooking Wine\n\nGround Black Pepper TT\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Technique:\n\n1. Add the chicken livers, onion, garlic, salt and water to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the chicken livers are barely pink on the inside, 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool with the cover on for 5-10 minutes.\n2. Strain the mixture and add the chicken livers, onion and garlic to a food processor. Process the ingredients until pureed. Add the wine, 5 spice and a few cracks of black pepper and pur\u00e9e until smooth again. With the machine running, add the tempered butter one cube at a time until emulsified into the liver mixture.\n3. Transfer to ramekins or a sealable container and refrigerate until solid. Serve chilled and spread on Vietnamese baguettes.\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickles Ingredients:\n\n1 1/2 cups White Vinegar\n\n1 cup water\n\n1 tsp Salt\n\n1/2 cup Sugar\n\n1 pound Carrot, Ribbons\n\n1 pound Diakon, julienned\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickle Technique:\n\n1. Add the vinegar and water to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and salt until dissolved. Remove from heat and pour over the carrot and daikon. Store covered in the fridge for 1-2 weeks.\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Ingredients:\n\n1 pound Boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\n1 stalk lemongrass, peeled and chopped fine\n\n2 Garlic cloves, minced\n\n2 Tbsp Lime Juice\n\n2 Tbsp Fish sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Dark Brown Sugar\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Technique:\n\n1. Combine all the ingredients in a bag and let marinate in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n2. Remove chicken from the bag, pat dry, shake off veg chunks and sear in a pan with some oil on both sides. Add a dash of the marinade to the pan, cover and cook on the stovetop until finished.\n3. Let cool slightly, chop up into pieces, set aside for sandwich.\n\n## To build the final sandwich:\n\n1. Hollow out baguette, spread thin pate on top of baguette, then pile in some lemongrass chicken.\n2. Top with cucumber, daikon and carrot pickles, jalapeno and cilantro. Close sandwich and munch as is or cut it in half.\n\n## Example Workflow:\n\n1. Make bread, let rest 30 minutes to an hour or until doubled in size.\n2. While the bread rises, make marinade and let chicken marinate for at least an hour. Make chicken liver pate, let chill and solidify in fridge. Cut all vegetables (cucumber, jals, carrots, daikon), make pickling liquid for quick pickles and submerge carrots and daikon.\n3. Shape baguettes, let rest another 30 minutes to an hour on tray, or until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30 minutes.\n4. While the shaped bread proofs and the oven preheats, cook the marinated chicken, chop into pieces and set aside.\n5. Bake baguettes, remove from oven and let rest for 20 minutes before opening. Ready all other prepped ingredients to build the sandwich.\n6. Build sandwich. Remove chunk of insides of dough, add lemongrass chicken, cucumber, pickles, jals and cilantro. Spread pate on top, then close the sandwich. Optionally cut in half and MUNCH HARD.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The baguette recipe makes enough for 4 medium (or 2 large) baguettes.\n* As usual, I\u2019ve provided grams for the bread component of the sandwich for accuracy.\n* French Baguettes and Vietnamese baguettes are different.\n* Chinese 5-spice powder consists of star anise, fennel, Szechuan peppercorns, cinnamon and cloves. If you\u2019d like, you can make your own blend, but the mixture is widely available in many American grocery stores.\n* \u201cBread Improver\u201d is a chemical dough relaxant that allows bread to stay malleable without having to rest it as long or at all. I spoke with a few professional bakers who said that Bread Improver is not necessary and only helpful when baking on a commercial scale. I did a side by side comparison and I couldn\u2019t tell a difference in taste with or without the improver so\u2026 leave it out. There\u2019s no reason to worry about it here.\n\n**Watch the video here -** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ\\_oIh4AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ_oIh4AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "created_utc": 1646841276.0, "score": 104, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The sour cherry pie that science made", "selftext": "I made a sour cherry pie on Monday, and it may be the finest pie I have ever made, in my 30 years or so of pie making. Omg, it turned out so well!\n\nThis is the pie that science made, for sure. Tapioca starch is the best thickener for fruit pies, especially acidic fruits. But there is a very specific ratio of starch + sugar + water from the fruit that is then cooked to a specific temperature in order to achieve gelatinization. The resulting fruit has the perfect set, your pie slices hold together exactly so, but when you bite into it, you just get fruit, perfectly cooked. No starchy flavor, no gummy texture, just fruit, seemingly magically held together. Thanks, science!\n\nIn order to achieve those temps, this pie is baked for about an hour and fifteen minutes at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), which is quite a long time for pie. The pastry gets browned sometime around 45 minutes for the crust to an hour for the lattice. This is where pie shields or foil come in handy. You just cover the top strategically to prevent further browning.\n\nI also use science for the pastry. I used to use a classic French method that yielded incredible, flaky dough\u2026 sometimes. I got so frustrated with the inconsistency, I stopped making pastry altogether, for years. Then I came back to it as if I knew nothing, followed the science, tried several methods, and ultimately landed on adding alcohol to the pastry in order to inhibit gluten production. This makes for a flaky crust every time. And when made in a food processor and then rested in the fridge, the resulting dough is workable enough to be used for all kinds of sweet and savory pies, including weaving lattice crusts, etc, for hand pies, for blind baked pie shells (where this recipe really gets a chance to show off), it is a one size fits all dough, which is what I needed.\n\nFood is one of my special interests.

{"title": "I analysed the recipes for Five Spice Powder, and this is what I found [x-post from /r/recipes]", "selftext": "*Was told you guys would enjoy this so I hope you do!*\n\nFive Spice Powder is as famous a foreign ingredient can get, while remaining a complete mystery. Most people know what it is, but if you ask them the ingredients, you\u2019ll be greeted with many blank stares, or incomplete answers. The reason is simple, there is no fixed recipe.\n\nIn a way, Five Spice is a lot like what Curry Powder is for Indians. Ask any Indian household what curry powder is, and you\u2019ll be quickly told that there are many kinds of different curry powders to suit individual curries. Recipes also vary from house to house, city to city, and state to state! In this regard, Five Spice is very similar. Recipes vary from household to household and province to province. **In some special cases, such as in Sichuan Province, entire ingredients are different** (they prefer to substitute Fennel Seeds / Ginger for Sichuan Peppercorns)!\n\nBut what goes of the household brands that sell the blend in supermarkets? How do they cater to the masses? Upon even just the most basic investigation, we find that there is no consensus at all. Not only do recipes vary tremendously, but **often the most unexpected ingredients such as Cardamom and even cornflour (!) make an appearance**, most likely to save on cost. We also noticed that certain staple ingredients such as Cloves are normally missing, due to their high price. These tend to be substituted with ordinary cumin seeds, pepper, liquorice or other odd items. To add to the curiousness, many supermarkets in our local market of Hong Kong, didn\u2019t sell the blend at all!\n\n(See link below for photos of labels from existing products)\n\nMy next goal was to reproduce the ideal recipe, assuming cost was no issue. Although some sources on the web pointed towards True Cinnamon being used for Five Spice, this we quickly dismissed \u2013 China hasn\u2019t consumed True Cinnamon in large quantities ever, as they much prefer to their local flavour of the spice, Cassia. We quickly found that Star Anise, Cassia, Fennel Seeds and Cloves were essential ingredients for all Five Spice blends, regardless of where you were in China. The last ingredient varies by province to province.\n\nIn the Southern parts of China, Ginger root and Mandarin Orange Peel are often preferred, probably due to the fact that this is where they originate from. Other parts of China use Sichuan Peppers, Chinese Black Cardamom, and even Galangal. But we were on the journey for the most preferred taste. After countless taste tests, and more research, we landed on our target: Chinese Ginger Roots. The reason turned out to be much simpler than expected: **Ginger is one of the most popular ingredients in Chinese cooking, and also contributes a key flavour to the blend, not found in the other ingredients. Citrus.** Ginger is also extremely popular in other regions where Five Spice is used: Vietnam, Indonesia, and other Asian countries all make heavy use of Ginger in regular cooking.\n\n\n**The final recipe**\n\n- Star Anise (1 star)\n- Cassia (1-2 grams)\n- Cloves (1-2 grams)\n- Fennel Seeds (1-2 grams)\n- Ginger (1-2 grams)\n\nInstructions: Grind them all together. Use around 0.5g per dish.\n\nI know it varies, but these proportions mimic the Five Spice philosophy perfectly: personalise it!\n\n[Link to blog for photos of other ingredients labels, one even openly admitted it mixed in flour.](http://regencyspices.hk/spicetrade/2014/08/05/five-spice-powder-whats-real-recipe/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "created_utc": 1407254518.0, "score": 71, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Ketchup made from the ground up... (not too sweet)", "selftext": "Ketchup and I have a complicated relationship. While other kids slathered their hotdogs, burgers and french fries with ketchup, I much preferred hot sauce or... just plain fried I guess. I viewed ketchup as a neon red sugar paste that has no place on anything one intends to put in their mouth. That is, until my early 20s when I tried some homemade ketchup from a local burger spot that blew my mind; it was tangy, salty, and umami with just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the whole deal. Never before did I know that ketchup could... not suck. Trust me, it might sound contrary, but I'm not a food elitist, I pretty much eat anything so forgive me when I say that most store-bought ketchup is... subpar.\n\nThe recipe and technique listed below is my attempt at recreating the homemade ketchup that turned me onto ketchup. I've decided to use San Marzano tomatoes because they're high quality, widely available all over the place, and always stay \"in season.\" If using fresh tomatoes, wait until summer or the ketchup isn't going to be too good. I've also included a video to those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions in the comments!\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 (28oz) cans San Marzano tomatoes, crushed\n* 1 cup Water\n* 1 cup White Vinegar\n* \u2154 cup Sugar\n* 2 tsp salt + more TT\n* 1 tsp MSG\n* 1 tsp Worcestershire\n* 1/2 tsp onion powder\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n* 1 tsp Fish Sauce + more TT\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Technique:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 300F.\n2. Pour tomatoes, water, sugar, salt, onion powder and garlic powder into the dutch oven. Break the tomato up with a wooden spoon.\n3. Place the dutch oven in the oven for 3-4 hours, or until reduced by about 2/3 and almost dry. Sometime at the 1.5 hour mark, stir the mixture making sure to push down any toasty tomato stuck to the sides of the pot.\n4. Add all the ingredients to a blender, and puree until a smooth mixture forms. Pass the puree through a fine mesh sieve to catch any seeds. Transfer to a sealable container and cool.\n5. Once cool, adjust seasoning and add fish sauce. Fish sauce is SALTY, if the finished ketchup needs more salt, keep in mind that the fish sauce will help with that. You should add enough that you get a certain umami from the fish sauce, but cannot fully taste or smell it - if you can taste it, you\u2019ve added too much.\n\n\\* *A Note about Xanthan Gum (XG):* Xanthan Gum is a hydrocolloid meaning that it thickens, strengthens and can sometimes smooth out purees and emulsions. I chose not to add it into the ketchup in this video because it seemed like an extra step. If using, puree the ketchup, pass it through a strainer, then reintroduce the ketchup to the blender and when pureeing add a bump of XG to the mix. Not too much, only 1/8th of a tablespoon or so will get you where you need to be.\n\n\\*\\* Wait until the ketchup is cooled before seasoning with salt. Cold food needs more salt, and if you season it while still hot, you could under season the ketchup. \n\n**Umami-LOADED Ketchup From Scratch** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "created_utc": 1625061802.0, "score": 68, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chimichangas from Arizona (Deep Fried Burritos)", "selftext": "Legend has it, the famous Arizonan Chimichanga was accidentally discovered by a Mexican-American mother. One day, in a rush to get food on the table to feed her small family, the woman added too much oil to the pan before frying her pre-rolled burritos. The burritos were deep-fried instead of shallow fried leaving her a crispy, crunchy, fully fried end result that would later be coined the \"chimichanga.\"\n\nIt may be a legend, sure. I mean there's no real historical proof that the discovery of the dish went down that way. Regardless of fact, it's a fun story that describes an awesome treat-of-a-dish. I started doing some research into the definition of American food by creating a video series on YouTube called \"Cooking the States.\" As you might imagine (and probably already know) the Southwestern states are HUGELY influenced by our neighbors down south; Mexico and the American Southwest have intimate cultural ties and food is no exception.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for Chimichangas aka Deep Fried Burritos. I made everything from scratch including the flour tortillas which, if you haven't tried homemade flour tortillas are well worth the time - they're supremely chewy and flavorful. The filling is just shredded beef and cheese while the other \"fillings\" that you might expect in a burrito are more like \"toppings.\" Anyways, I'll leave my recipe below and, if you want to cook-along, a video to go along with it. Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjAWxIXHbVg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam). Cheers!\n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n* 3-4 pound Beef Chuck Roast\n* 3 dried Guajillo Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Ancho Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Chipotle Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 4 Garlic Cloves\n* 4 cups Beef Stock\n* 1/2 cup Tomato Puree\n* 1 tsp ground Allspice\n* 1 tsp dried Oregano\n* 3 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar\n* 2 tsp Kosher Salt\n* 1 stick of Cinnamon\n* 3 Bay Leaves\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n* 680g All-purpose Flour\n* 100g Lard\n* 7g Kosher Salt\n* 360g Water, warm (about 90F)\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n* Flour Tortillas (from recipe)\n* Beef Barbacoa (from recipe)\n* 8 ounces Colby Cheese, cut into batons\n* 8 ounces Monterey Jack Cheese, cut into batons\n* Neutral Oil for frying\n\n**To serve...**\n\n* Romaine Lettuce, shredded\n* Black olives, sliced thin\n* Tomato, seeded and diced\n* Avocado, sliced thin\n* Mexican Crema\n* Lime Wedges\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 250F.\n2. Bring the stock up to a boil then turn off the heat, and pour the stock into a blender. Add the torn chiles and garlic then cover. Let the mixture steep for 15-20 minutes, or until the chiles have softened.\n3. Add the red wine vinegar, dried oregano, cinnamon, allspice and tomato puree. Blitz into a thin puree. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or vinegar if need be.\n4. In a large dutch oven over high heat, sear the beef chuck until richly brown and caramelized then pour over the chili braising liquid from the blender. Add the cinnamon stick and bay leaves then braise the beef.\n5. If using a regular pot or dutch oven braise with the lid on, for 2-3 hours, or until you can easily shred the meat with a fork. If using a pressure cooker, cover the braise and place over a burner over high heat. Allow the braise to rise up to full pressure, then lower the heat to medium and hold the braise at high pressure for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cut the heat and carefully release the pressure with a wooden spoon.\n6. Remove the beef from the pot and let cool slightly. Take the beef out of the braising liquid and shred it with a fork then set it aside. Optionally do this step ahead and let the beef rest in the braising liquid overnight for more flavor, but make sure the beef is drained before folding burritos.\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n1. In a large bowl, work the fat into the flour with your fingers until incorporated like pie dough. Make a well in the center of the bowl. Dissolve salt into the water then pour it into the well and work it into the flour by hand. Work the dough until it comes together, then dump it onto the counter and knead until smooth.\n2. Divide the dough into 6 portions, set them covered on a plate and let rest for 30 minutes.\n3. With flour as needed, roll out the little balls to 14 inches with a rolling pin. Heat a large, wide, ungreased pan or tray over medium heat and cook the tortillas for 20-30 seconds, flip and repeat on the other side. Don\u2019t overcook the tortillas or they\u2019ll become crispy.\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n1. Lay a flour tortilla on a clean work surface and spoon in some beef strained barbacoa followed by a piece of Colby and Monterey cheese, top with more beef. Wrap the burrito tightly into a flat rectangular shape similar to a pizza pocket, secure with wooden toothpicks, then set it on a baking sheet while you roll the remaining burritos.\n2. Bring the oil to 375F and fry the burritos, two-three at a time, until crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oil, let rest while you fry the remaining burritos and fry a second time for an extra crispy Chimichanga. Drain the finished burritos on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n3. Serve with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, black olives and a zigzag of fresh Mexican crema.

Focus on Thanksgiving recipes for now. Feedback welcome. Click** [**here**](http://app.parsnip.ai/) **to check it out!**\n\n[I'm a NYC chef who closed my restaurant due to Covid](https://ny.eater.com/2018/1/31/16939072/zai-lai-beef-noodle-soup-nyc-review). To keep myself busy, I've been re-writing Thanksgiving recipes for my friends and me in an easy-to-learn way. I've done this by focusing on cooking\u00a0*skills progression.*\n\nA little background: As I was training my staff, I discovered a recipe format that made learning and executing so much quicker. I simply focused on labeling the\u00a0*underlying technique*\u00a0behind each step. This anchor point helped my cooks quickly connect what they already knew to what they were doing. By focusing on techniques that are shared across many different recipes, practicing a particular recipe meant they were getting better at making related recipes.\n\nI found this practice of breaking kitchen skills into small discrete units helped cooks quickly grasp what I was asking of them and greatly expedited the learning curve. Cooks knew whether they were trained in a specific skill or not. And if not, they could get up to speed quickly.\n\nMy friends and I ([deepakChopra707](https://www.reddit.com/user/deepakChopra707/)\u00a0&\u00a0[mizzao](https://www.reddit.com/user/mizzao/)) have recently created a mobile web app that encompasses all these ideas. If you\u2019re cooking for Thanksgiving, feel free to try it out and let us know if its helpful. Keep in mind, these recipes were chosen for flavor not health (meaning there's plenty of butter). The app is designed to be used on mobile devices.

{"title": "Your own Chicago-Style Giardiniera (Italian Pickle Condiment)", "selftext": "Giardiniera are spicy, pickled Italian vegetables. It comes in chunkier small diced form, or my personal favorite Giardiniera relish. Giardiniera is magical on pizza, sandwiches, burgers and, of course, absolutely crucial for any respectable Italian Beef sandwich.\n\nGiardiniera is a lifestyle here in Chicago and it took me until I was 12 years old to realize that it a Chicago thing. I was out of town and walked up to a server at a pizza restaurant asking for some and she looked at me crooked like a confused pooch. I was sad. But you don't have to be sad because no matter where you reside, you can make it at home. It takes a few days, but it's pretty easy and once you make a batch you'll be good for weeks, probably even months - yes, it keeps for a long time.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe, the technique and a video to go along with it all. I hope it helps. If you have any questions, let me know in the comment section here. Good luck!\n\n**Giardiniera Ingredients\u2026**\n\n*Giardiniera Veg:*\n\n* Half head of Cauliflower (260g), large dice\n* 4 Celery stalks (250g), large dice\n* 3 Carrots (270g), large dice \n* 12 Serrano Peppers (100g), seeds removed, large dice\n* 1 cup Green Olives (140g), pitted\n\n*8% Salt Brine (Day 1):*\n\n(Weight of water + veg) \\* (.08) = Salt Weight\n\n\\*\\*\\*Example Weight for Salt Brine:\n\nWeight of Veg with water just to cover - 2000g\n\n2000 \\* .08 = 160g\n\n*Pickling Liquid (Day 2-5):*\n\n* Water (half weight of Salt Brine)\n* Distilled White Vinegar (half weight of Salt Brine)\n* 3 tbsp Dried Thyme (9g)\n* 3 tbsp Dried Oregano (9g)\n* 1 tbsp Chili flakes (5g)\n* 6 Garlic cloves (30g), whole /peeled\n\nTECHNIQUE...\n\n1. Cut the veg into similar sized pieces. Fill just to cover with water. Record the weight of the water and veg, and add 8% kosher salt by weight. Set out a room temperature for one day.\n2. The next day, place a large bowl on a scale and zero it out. Drain the salty brine into the bowl, record the weight then discard the salty brine. To a medium sauce pan, add 50% of the weight of the liquid in water and the other 50% in white distilled vinegar. Add the spices and garlic to the pickling liquid, bring to a light boil and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3. Pour the pickling liquid over the veg, let cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. Let sit for 3 days before using.\n4. On day 3, strain the pickling liquid. Add the veg to a food processor and pulse to make a minced, \u201crelish-like\u201d, consistency. The giardiniera will last for a while in the fridge, at least 2-3 months.\n\nHOMEMADE Chicago-Style Giardiniera (Italian Pickle Condiment) - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Yf2GRlLQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Yf2GRlLQ4)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/nljfue/your_own_chicagostyle_giardiniera_italian_pickle/", "created_utc": 1622042131.0, "score": 55, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/nljfue/your_own_chicagostyle_giardiniera_italian_pickle/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cassoulet - A simple guide to a not-so-simple dish...", "selftext": "Cassoulet is a complex meat and bean stew from the Southwest of France. Some believe Cassoulet to date back to the dark ages and others claim its actually ancient. Traditionally, it's made by loading a \"cassoul\" or clay casserole dish with many types of pork and duck, then topped with beans and cooked using a technique that leaves the upper beans crisp and the insides soft and unctuous. \n\nI spent the past week planning and gathering ingredients to make the famed French \"Cassoulet\" entirely from scratch. I wanted to challenge myself and indeed was it a challenge, but a fun one at that.\n\nI broke down a duck to confit the legs, I made fresh Toulouse sausage by hand, I simmered the beans with homemade ham that I brined and smoked and of course sourced the \"Tarbais\" beans from a specialty food website. All in all, a ton of work and effort went into making this cassoulet and I'm super amped to be able to share my recipe with you. Below you will find the ingredients for each component and it's technique. I also made a video on how to make the Cassoulet and all of its components if you'd rather watch than read. I hope this one finds you well and that, even if you cut some corners to save time, you give it a go!\n\n***FULL CASSOULET INGREDIENTS\u2026***\n\n**For the Beans...**\n\n* 2.5 pounds White Beans (1kg)\n* 1 Yellow Onion (375g)\n* 1 Carrot (56g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Tomato Paste (28g)\n* 3 medium Tomatoes (528g)\n* 5 Garlic cloves (15g)\n* 6-8 cups Chicken Stock (plus 2-3 cups more for later)\n* 2/ 3 lb Pork Belly (300g)\n* 1/ 2 lb Ham\n* 3 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Duck Fat (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Salt (35g)\n\n**For the Herb Sachet in the Beans...**\n\n* Small Bundle Fresh thyme (5g)\n* Small Bundle Fresh Parsley (9g)\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 1 tsp Black Peppercorn (3g)\n* 1 tsp Juniper Berries(2g)\n* 4 cloves (.5g)\n\n**Additional Meat for the final Cassoulet\u2026**\n\n* 4-5 Pork Spare Ribs (400g)\n* 3 six inch Toulouse Sausage Links(400g)\n* Bundle of Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 2 tbsp Duck Fat (30ml)\n\n**Duck Confit\u2026** \n\n* 4-6 Duck Legs\n* Duck Fat to submerge legs\n* Thyme (fresh, picked and pressed in)\n* Zest from half an Orange\n* 6 Garlic Cloves (1 per leg)\n* Salt (about a half teaspoon per leg)\n* Cracked Black Pepper TT\n\n**Toulouse Sausage\u2026 (recipe yields 5 lb or 15-20 links)**\n\n* 3.5 pounds Pork Shoulder (1.6 kg)\n* 1.5 pounds Fatback (680g)\n* 3/4 cup White Wine (175ml)\n* 1/4 cup Brandy (60ml)\n* 3 tablespoons Kosher salt (40g)\n* 3 tablespoons minced garlic (50g, 15-20 cloves)\n* 1 tablespoons ground black pepper 8g\n* 1 tablespoon ground white pepper 8g\n* 1 teaspoon Nutmeg, freshly grated (optional)\n* 10-12 feet Natural Hog Casings (32-38mm)\n\n\\*serve with additional red wine vinegar and a nice bottle of light red wine.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nToulouse Sausage...\n\n1. Cut up pork belly and back fat into small-medium pieces manageable for the grinder. Toss the meat in the pepper, garlic, nutmeg and salt and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. Begin soaking the hog casings in a small bowl of cold water, set aside.\n2. Grind the mixture through a \u201cchunky\u201d (8mm) die and onto a sheet tray.\n3. Once all the meat is ground, add it to the bowl of the stand mixer and, with the paddle attachment on, mix the meat on low for a minute. After a minute, add the wine and brandy, then increase the speed to medium and mix for a minute or two longer. The liquid should be completely incorporated and the meat should look sticky.\n4. Optionally, fry up a bit of the meat and taste test it for seasoning.\n5. Set up the sausage stuffer on the stand mixer and stuff the ground meat into the hog casings.\n6. Tie off one end of the hog casing. Use one hand to help the casing off of the nozzle, and the other to guide the sausage onto the sheet tray.\n7. After stuffing, if forming links, poke holes in the sausage coil to make sure it doesn\u2019t burst while twisting. To form links, twist the sausage every 6-7 inches. If serving to a crowd, you can also leave the whole sausage in a coil and cook the sausage as is.\n8. Cook the sausage to an internal temperature of 160F, serve however you damn well please. Son. \n\nDuck Confit\u2026\n\n1. The day before cooking, season the duck legs liberally with salt and press the aromatics into the legs. Cover the tray with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days.\n2. The next day, remove the duck legs from the tray and rinse under cold running water. Do your best to remove all the salt and aromatics, then pat dry.\n3. Place the duck legs in a container taller than it is wide, submerge the legs in the duck fat, cook on 200F (93c) for 6 hours, or until their tender.\n   1. At first the legs will float, but as they cook and release water and air, they will sink to the bottom.\n   2. At first the cooking fat will be cloudy, when the legs are nearly done the fat will be clear.\n   3. If cooking the confit sous vide, season the legs with salt (not too much compared to conventional confit), then pack in your aromatics and cook sous vide for 185F (85c) for 6-8 hours for a \u201cshreddy\u201d classic confit consistency. Then chill down, in the bag, in an ice bath. Store in the fridge before using.\n4. Remove the duck legs from the oven and let them cool to room temperature in the fat. Once cooled to room temperature, if you intend to keep them in the fridge for a while, keep them in the fat to let their flavor develop. If you plan to use sooner, you can store them in a plastic bag or air-tight container. \n5. To prepare the confit, pour some fat onto a sheet tray, place the legs on and roast, skin side up, on 350F for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed. The crisp under the broiler for a couple minutes.\n\nCassoulet Beans\u2026\n\n1. Cover Beans with a few inches of water, and set aside to soak overnight. The next day rinse and drain, then set aside.\n2. In a large dutch oven, pad the bottom of the pot with the pork belly and cured ham (prevents the beans from sticking) then cover with the chicken stock. The beans should be covered by at least an inch or two of stock.\n3. Add the onion, carrot, tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic cloves, red wine vinegar, duck fat, and the herb sachet (thyme, parsley, bay, cloves, peppercorns, juniper berries).\n4. Cook gently on medium heat for an hour to an hour and a half, or until the beans are just tender. You want the beans to stop cooking just as they begin turning tender to avoid overcooking into mush.\n5. Once the beans are tender, remove the pot from the heat. Remove and discard all of the aromatic vegetables and herb sachet. Set the pork belly and cured ham aside for later use. Cover the beans up and let them hang out in their juices until we need them later.\n\nTo assemble the Cassoulet\u2026\n\n1. Start by roasting the toulouse sausage and pork ribs. Place the ribs and sausage in a pan and brown with duck fat and thyme. Once browned, deglaze the pan with water and add the jus to the bean cooking liquid. Set the meat aside for later.Place the pork ribs and sausage in a large roasting tray. Add a branch of thyme, a bay leaf, and 5 garlic cloves, and a drizzle of duck fat and oil. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the meat has some coloring.\n2. Place all the meats at the bottom of the pot.Optionally shred up a confit leg and add it to the mix. Use a slotted spoon, or something similar to spoon the beans, without the liquid, over the meat. Once the pot is layered and filled Use the bean cooking liquid to fill the dutch oven to the top of the beans.\n3. Bake in a 400F oven for 1 and a half hours. Check the beans twice, every 30 minutes to push the crust down and add a bit more bean cooking liquid (or chicken stock if you ran out). This remoistening process is going to allow the cassoulet to get very crispy without totally burning.\n4. During the last 15 minutes of cooking, about an hour and fifteen minutes into the process, put the confit duck on a sheet tray and add to the oven. With the cassoulet. Remove the cassoulet, then broil the duck confit until the skin is crispy then add it to the top of the finished cassoulet.\n5. Remove cassoulet from oven, serve with a bit of red wine vinegar (a condiment that helps cut through the richness and ease digestion.)\n\n*Example Workflow...*\n\nDay 1 - Break down duck, render fat, begin Cure for Duck Legs, Make Toulouse sausage.\n\nDay 2- Remove duck from cure, confit duck.

{"title": "Baja-style Fish Tacos: Recipe and History", "selftext": "Southern California is next in my quest to cook the signature dish of every American state. Thought this dish is surely Mexican, it has become Americanized in some aspects (depending where you go, of course) and is a top-seller on many Mexican-American menus.\n\nLegend has it Japanese sailors traveling to the Baja peninsula taught locals how to fry the fish with a tempura-like batter (something they learned from the Portuguese years prior). Not before long the crispy fried fish took on some Mexican flare from the locals and fish tacos quickly became a common on-the-go meal for fisherman and market workers. It wasn't until sometime in the 1980s did a San Diego based Mexican-American restauranteur popularize the taco by putting it on his menu. \n\nThe fish taco truly is a story of the intimate cultural connection between Mexico and the United States. If we take it a step further, perhaps a story of mid 20th century globalization between East and West (being Japan and Mexico). The rest is history.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for all the components of a classic SoCal, Baja-style fish taco. From Pico to Crema, it's all there. Let me know if you have any questions. Let me know if you'd like a link to the recipe video and I can shoot it over to you. I hope you like it!  \n\n\n**Fish Batter:**\n\n*This batter is inspired by The Fat Duck outside of London. The water in the alcohol evaporates quickly leaving us with a super wispy, crispy and light coating.*\n\n* 1 1/2 cup Self Rising Flour\n* 2 cups Rice Flour\n* 2 tsp Baking Powder\n* 2 Tbsp Honey\n* 1.5 cups Vodka\n* 2 cups Beer\n\n1. Mix the flour and baking soda in a large bowl. Dissolve the honey into the vodka then pour it into the flour mix. Add the beer and whisk together. Keep the batter cold in the fridge until needed.\n\n**Chili de Arbol Salsa:**\n\n*This \u201cSalsa\u201d is probably more like a hot sauce to the American palate. It\u2019s thin, vibrant red and very spicy.*\n\n* 1 Garlic clove, smashed\n* 1 cup Dried Chili de Arbol, stemmed\n* \u2153 cup Water\n* 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* Kosher Salt, to taste\n\n1. Snap the stems off of the chilies. Dry roast the chilis in a hot skillet until aromatic then add to a blender, do the same to the garlic.\n2. Blend the chilis and garlic until pulverized completely, then add the water, salt and vinegar and process again until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve over fish tacos.\n\n**Avocado Crema:**\n\n*This creamy sauce is a much needed cooling element to the taco. It\u2019s also good on sandwiches, eggs, etc.*\n\n* 2 avocados, pitted and peeled\n* 1 Garlic clove\n* \u00bd cup Mexican Crema\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt, more to taste\n* 3-4 Tbsp Lime juice, more to taste\n\n1. Blend everything in a food processor. If the crema is too thick, thin it down with more lime juice or water.\n\n**Pico de Gallo:**\n\n*This is everyone's favorite mild, refreshing salsa and it couldn\u2019t be easier to make.*\n\n* 3 tomato, diced and seeded\n* 1 white onion, diced\n* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped\n* 1-2 Jalapenos, finely chopped\n* 2 Tbsp Lime Juice, more to taste\n* Kosher salt, to taste\n\n**To Build the Tacos\u2026**\n\n1. Double up the tortillas, lay in the fish followed by a drizzle of the arbol salsa, the slaw, the pico and the avocado crema. Serve with a cold, crisp cerveza and crush!\n\n**P.S.** Any white saltwater fish works great for fish tacos.

{"title": "Recreating Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza at Home from Dough to Sausage...", "selftext": "I'm from Chicago. Around these parts 2 pizza styles reign - Tavern Style thin crust, and the infamous Deep Dish pizza (which many argue is more like a casserole.) Though I find myself surrounded with deep dish joints and a number of great deep dish options, I wanted to have a whack at making it myself, from scratch, at home.\n\nBelow is are my measurements/weights and recipe for what I believe to be a pretty solid technique for making domestic deep dish. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below. I'm happy to help in any way that I can. For my visual people, I've also provided a link to the cook-along video. Everything will be listed below. Go bersss.\n\n**THE DOUGH\u2026** \n\n\\*\\*\\*enough for 10-12in cast iron pan.\n\n* 250g Bread Flour\n* 25g corn meal \n* 75g Olive Oil\n* 100g Warm Water (110F)\n* 3g Instant Yeast\n* 5g Salt\n\n**THE TOMATO SAUCE\u2026**\n\n* 465g San Marzano Tomatoes, drained\n* 2g Kosher Salt\n* 2g Sugar\n* 2g Red Wine Vinegar\n* 2g Dried Oregano\n* Fish Sauce TT (optional)\n\n**THE CHEESE\u2026**\n\n\\*\\*\\*50/50 Whole Milk Mozzarella / Part-skim Mozzarella... makes roughly 1 lb.\n\n* 225g Part-skim Mozzarella\n* 225g Whole Milk Mozzarella\n\n**THE PARM CRUMBLE\u2026**\n\n\\*Add a medium hunk of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to a blender or food processor and blitz it up into small crumbles. The leftover crumble saves well in the fridge and come in handy for other stuff.\n\n**\u201cSPICY\u201d ITALIAN SAUSAGE SPICE BLEND\u2026**\n\n* 3lb Pork Shoulder \n* 1lb Pork Belly (33% fat)\n* 30g Kosher Salt (3 tbsp)\n* 33g Sugar (2 tbsp)\n* 8g Fennel Seed (whole, toasted. 1.5 tbsp)\n* 2g Coriander Seed (whole, toasted, 1/ 2 tbsp)\n* 16g Sweet Paprika (2 tbsp)\n* 6g Dried Oregano (2.5 tbsp)\n* 6g Dried Basil (2.5 tbsp)\n* 6 Garlic, minced (2 cloves)\n* 8g Red Chili Flake (1.5 tbsp) \\*\\*\\*leave out for mild sausage\n* 9g Black Peppercorn (whole, toasted, 1.5 tbsp)\n* 1/2 Cup Ice Water\n* 1/4 White Wine\n\nTECHNIQUE:\n\n1. Stir flour, corn meal, yeast, salt and olive oil together.\n   1. We usually don\u2019t add salt to the dough because it slows gluten formation, but in this case we don\u2019t care about gluten formation so add it all in.\n2. Mix together long enough to form a shaggy dough, then cover and autolyse for 20-30mins at room temp.\n3. After autolyse, mix in water. Knead dough on speed 2 with dough hook for 4 mins, let dough rest for 4 minutes, then knead on speed 2 for additional 4 minutes.\n4. Round dough off, cover, and place in airtight container to bulk ferment for 2-3 hours, or until dough doubles.\n5. Preheat oven to 425F (218c).\n6. Pulse tomatoes with blender, and drain so that only chunks remain. Season tomato chunks with ingredients listed.\n7. Grate cheese, set aside.\n8. \\*\\*\\* The sausage deserves a video all on it's own and would make this recipe 4x the length. For the sausage, I'll refer you a technique video, but the ingredients above are all you need. Or opt out of this step and buy bulk Italian sausage.\n9. Butter 10 or 12 inch cast iron heavily, then sprinkle in some grated parmesan to coat the bottom and sidewalls.\n10. Use your fingers to spread the dough out, then line it in the cast iron.\n11. Lay in the cheese, then Italian sausage, then drained and seasoned diced tomatoes. Top with more parmesan crumbles.\n12. Cook the pizza on the stovetop for 5-10 minutes to give the bottom of the crust head start crisping.\n13. Transfer the pizza into the middle oven rack and bake for 30-40 mins or until the crust is a golden brown all around and pizza it hot.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Most of the time we don\u2019t add salt or sugar to the dough before autolyse because it can inhibit gluten formation, but in this case we don\u2019t care about gluten so we can add the salt to the dough early.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Stirring in the fat first stops gluten from forming heavily which makes for a flakier crust.\n\n\\*\\*\\*High fat, low hydration dough which eats more like a biscuit and helps wick away moisture from the meat, cheese and tomato sauce.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Adding the fatty cheese first helps wick away moisture from the sausage and tomatoes sauce.\n\n**Making Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza from Scratch** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fL8uLuXkl8&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fL8uLuXkl8&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)\n\nBulk Italian Sausage - https://studio.youtube.com/video/b-GZjJrlzNQ/edit/basic", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/jb2hee/recreating_chicagostyle_deep_dish_pizza_at_home/", "created_utc": 1602688248.0, "score": 48, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/jb2hee/recreating_chicagostyle_deep_dish_pizza_at_home/", "html_title": ""}

It's soooo much space and soooo much work to individually pull each one off the counter and place it on a tray so that it's touching no others.

In clumps and putting them on a cooling tray (like for cookies and stuff) to dry. They were nice and straight, but still one atop another, so that the sides facing the air dried but the ones or parts of ones covered by others didn't dry and stuck together some.\n\nThey cooked fine, though a bunch ripped trying to get them to unstick. When I heavily floured them before drying but that flour definitely got wet during the drying so didn't stop the sticking.\n\nHow do you guys dry long noodles? Any suggestions?\n\nEdit:\n\nPasta recipe:\n\n2 parts semolina flour to 1 part water\n\nKnead with flour on the counter for a few minutes\n\nForm into ball and let rest 20-30 minutes in a bowl covered with a tea towel\n\nBe very liberal with the flour for the next step, like very liberal.

{"title": "Shelf stable recipe request for micro studio life", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI've found a cheap apartment but I have no oven and only an induction cooktop and a \"white trash George foreman\" (waffle iron). I also have a mini fridge.\n\nI would like to know if you all have any suggestions for things I could make and put on the shelf in Mason jars.\n\nI do a bit of pickling. My method is to clean the jars, the whole cooking area and wipe everything down with lysol wipes except for the jars, those I rinse with a little vinegar. I'll take my clean veggies and chop them up, stuffing then into the jar. I then mix my brine and bring it to a boil and put it over the veggies, filling the jar. Thermal contraction still keeps the seal tight and the few remaining bacteria will soon be denatured by hot vinegar. The pickles are nice and crunchy and I win.\n\nI intend to make a jar of kraut with my next pickle batch and other than various pickled veggies and kraut I don't know what else to prepare that keeps on a shelf in a jar. I'm not big on jellies and jams and I do love spicy food.\n\nI make a lot of hummus and blended lentil soups so the freezer gets full quickly. I'll gladly accept freezer food ideas but that's not really what I'm looking for.\n\n\nIf you have a favorite pickled Olive and mushroom recipe I'll give it a go. Feel free to share your best torshii combination. However I feel like \"pickled this and pickled that\" can't be the only answer here, or maybe it is?\n\nI'm just trying to save money and have bright, happy, tasty food.\n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/sb0aq5/shelf_stable_recipe_request_for_micro_studio_life/", "created_utc": 1642962713.0, "score": 42, "author": "No_Finger2852", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/sb0aq5/shelf_stable_recipe_request_for_micro_studio_life/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "pizza crust - I keep messing it up", "selftext": "apologies in advance if this is asked a million times.  just point me to that post and will read intently.\n\nSo here's the scoop - I have been attempting my own pizza crust for a while (think years).  I'd gotten it to about a \"meh, it tastes like pizza crust\" level, using bread flour.   If I do it on the weber grill it goes a little better, but still.. just ok.  So I got a \"kit\" at one point as a gift from Williams Sonoma   (pizza crust+ sauce),  did THAT on the weber and it was just freaking great.  As good a crust as I've ever had.  So I've gone down a hole trying to make a better pizza crust, and its just not working.  I can't get beyond 'meh'.\n\nI've tried '00' flour,  more expensive bread flour.  I've used a food processor, I've mixed by hand.  I've used purely metric measurements from youtube videos made by italians (as opposed to imperial or whatever we americans call what do our measuring with) .  If anything I just end up making it worse.    What is the magic I'm missing?\n\nHere's the process at this point:\n\nusing various flours (again either \"00\", bread etc.  I'm not mixing the flours together, just using different types).   Here's the basic recipe\n\n600ml water\n\n1kg  flour (edited)\n\n30g salt\n\n2g yeast\n\nI mix with my hands and end up kneading no more than 12 minutes (I timed it) .

{"title": "Home-Cured, Glazed and Smoked Whole Holiday Ham", "selftext": "Ham reminds me of cartoons from the 1950-60s. Those big ornate, steaming hams decorated with pineapple rings, cherries and cloves... definitely the food of yesterday. Then I got to thinking, why do I never see whole hams presented at the market or even at most well-stocked butchers? The fact is, people just don't make whole ham on the reg like they used to. Thus, marking the beginning of my quest to make a classic cured, glazed and smoked ham from scratch in my home kitchen.\n\nMy adventure started by researching all about curing and curing salts. I spoke with a handful of my chef friends and picked the mind of a great local butcher. Then I delved into making a yummy, holiday-y maple/dijon glaze and finally figured out how to turn my Weber kettle charcoal grill into a smoker.\n\nAfter a few weeks of planning and testing, I came up on some accurate brine/curing measurements and what I believe to be a sound technique and recipe to make a whole ham. I'm going to provide a picture, the technique and all of my measurements in the post below. I'm also going to provide a video for those of you who prefer something visual. We still have time before Christmas and New Years - this could be a fun project to undertake for the holidays! Good luck, let me know if you have any questions.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*My Cure/Brine Measurements\u2026*\n\n* *Total Ham Weight - 14.5lb (6578g)*\n* *Total Ham Weight (w/o bone) - 10.5lb (4762g)*\n* *Bone Weight - 3-4lb (1814g)*\n* *Water - 4qt (1 gallon) = 3800g \\* 3 = 11400g*\n* *5% Salt of water weight = 570g*\n* *3% Sugar of water weight = 342g*\n* Pink Salt (.25% of meat weight) - (4762g \\* .0025) = 11.92 \\~ 12g Pink Salt aka Prague Powder #1\n\n*\\*\\*\\*(Salt %* *x Water Weight = Total Kosher Salt weight)*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Use the same equation to calculate Total Sugar Weight*\n\n\\*\\*\\*I\u2019ve spoken to many amazing professional cooks and chefs, butchers about pink salt and everybody gave me a different answer in terms of how to use it. However one thing was constant - a little goes a long way. Too much of this stuff can be toxic, so take it easy. Less is more.\n\n*Maple-Dijon Ham Glaze\u2026*\n\n* 1 Cup Dark Brown Sugar\n* 1/ 2 Cup Dark Maple Syrup\n* 1/ 4 Cup Dijon Mustard\n* 1/ 4 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder\n* 1/ 2 Tsp Ground Clove\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n**Technique\u2026**\n\n1. Score ham.\n2. Weigh and record ham. Use weight of ham to then measure out .25% pink salt #1 and set aside.\n3. Take weight of large brining vessel and zero scale. Add the ham to the vessel and fill with water until the meat is submerged by a few inches. Remove the ham and record the weight of the water.\n4. Measure out 5% salt and 3% sugar by weight of the water.\n   1. This is a traditional gradient brine, not to be mistaken with an ultra precise equilibrium.\n5. Mix salt, sugar and pink salt into the cold water in the large vessel until dissolved.\n6. Place the ham on a large sheet tray and inject the meat a few times all over. Once injected, place the ham in the brine, cover and refrigerate.\n   1. The ham should brine at a rate of 2lb per day. So if you have a 15lb ham, keep it in the brine for about a week.\n7. Stir the brine on day 2, inject again on day 4, stir once more on day 5 then remove the ham from the brine on day 7.\n   1. Feel free to stir the brine every day if possible.\n8. Rinse the ham thoroughly under running water, then pat dry. Let the ham rest uncovered on a rack in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n   1. This stage will allow something called a pellicle to form, which will allow an outer crust to form when cooked and help the smoke adhere to the ham.\n9. Smoke the ham in a 200F smoker until the internal temp reads 130-140F.\n10. Meanwhile, make the glaze by mixing together glaze ingredients and cooking down until viscous.\n11. After 2 hours, brush the ham with glaze, then cover.\n12. After another hour or so, glaze the ham again and smoke until the internal temp hits 130-140F. Bring the ham back inside, glaze again, and finish cooking in a 250F oven until the internal temp hits 155F.\n13. If serving immediately, let rest for at least 45 minutes before carving.\n14. If cooking ahead, chill down the ham. The next day, carve the ham then set it on a tray to warm it in a very low oven. Once warmed through, plate pieces on a presentation platter and serve immediately.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "created_utc": 1608136994.0, "score": 39, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Making Tofu with Fresh Soybeans", "selftext": "I love tofu. I know plenty of people out there who like to hate on it, but the fact is - Tofu is what you make it. The sauce, cooking technique and a number of other factors is what determines if the tofu is good or bad. One largely overlooked factor, in modern times at least, is the quality of the actual soybeans used to make the tofu and the tofu itself. Like any other protein or vegetable, there is a noticeable difference between good and bad tofu. I've been lucky enough to live near a market that sells super great, homemade tofu that I buy regularly. However, as of recent fall is in full effect and my local farmer's markets are beginning to close for the season... so I decided to have a whack at making my own soybean tofu, from scratch, at home and it turned out GREAT!\n\nTofu making is a super fun, different cooking project that is surprisingly simple and fairly inexpensive to make. Plus, like eating homemade pasta, there's something about eating tofu made by your own hands that is mega satisfying. I'm going to leave the recipe, technique directions and a short explainer video for my visual people below. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.\n\n*Tofu Ingredients:*\n\n* 310g Soaked Soybeans (2 cups)\n* 946ml Water (4 cups)\n* 15ml Liquid Nigari (1 tbsp), or other \"coagulant\"\n* 30ml Water for mixing Nigari (2 tbsp)\n\n*Tofu Technique:*\n\n1. Submerge 2 cups of soybeans in water and soak overnight. \\*This will yield more beans than you need for one portion from this recipe, but I like the \"insurance policy.\"\n2. Drain the soaked soybeans and add 2 cups of soaked soybeans to a blender along with 4 cups of water. Blend until smooth.\n3. Pour into sauce pan and bring up to a boil on medium heat, then reduce to simmer and simmer for 10 minutes. Skim the top foam.\n4. Pour the bean water mixture into a strainer lined with cheese cloth positioning a bowl underneath to catch the liquid. This liquid is our fresh soymilk.  \n\n   1. Squeeze the bean mash in the cheese cloth to fully drain it. Reserve this mash, it makes a great stew, but that's another recipe.\n5. Add 1 tbsp of liquid Nigari to 2 tbsp of water, mix and set aside.\n6. Pour the fresh soy milk in another sauce pan and over low-medium heat, bring it to 170F (76c).\n7. Once the tofu mixture hits 170F, cut the heat and gently add in half of the Nigari water mixture. Stir gently and pop the lid on. Let this sit for 5 minutes, then repeat the process with the remaining nigari mixture.\n8. By now the curd should be separated from the whey. Pour the mixture into a tofu mold lined with cheesecloth, put a weight on top, and let the press the tofu to your desired firmness. The longer the press, the firmer the tofu.  \n\n   1. A good starting place is 5 minutes for soft tofu, 7 for medium and 10+ minutes for anything firm.\n9. Store the pressed tofu in cold water and let chill for at least 30 minutes before eating. This will help tighten things up and give it a nice texture, even if you prefer your tofu on the softer side.\n10. Use immediately, or store in water, refrdgerated for 4 or 5 days.\n\n**Making Tofu from Scratch with Fresh Soybeans -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2\\_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "created_utc": 1603294694.0, "score": 39, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Wisconsin Style Bratwurst (Braised in Beer)", "selftext": "I'm from Chicago. To those of you who, like myself, are geographically challenged, Chicago is just south from Wisconsin. Wisconsin is known for 3 foods... beer, cheese and brats... giving the holy trinity a new meaning.\n\nBecause we're in the midst of Oktoberfest and to honor the Midwestern United States, my home, I decided to delve into the world of bratwurst and have a whack at making my own \"Sheboygan\" style brats. Sheboygan county in Wisconsin is the home of the bratwurst here in the U.S. and the area responsible for making the \"brat\" go mainstream here. The recipe is posted below, let me know if you have any questions.\n\nP.S. I've included a video for my visual people who would like to cook along. Prost!\n\n*BRATWURST MEAT...*\n\n* 4lb (1814g) Lean Pork\n* lb (453g) Pork Fat (makes 25% fat sausage)\n* 40g (4 tbsp) Kosher Salt\n* \\*Feel free to run the sausage a second time through a smaller die for a finer texture.\n* \\*\\*Roughly 10g (1 tbsp) salt per lb of sausage meat.\n\n*\u201cSHEBOYGAN\u201d SPICE BLEND: (enough for 5 lb of sausages)*\n\n* 1.5g (3 tsp) Dried Marjoram\n* 7g (2 tsp) Garlic Powder\n* 4g (2 tsp) Ginger Powder\n* 3g (6 pods) Whole Mace\n* 4g (2 tsp) Whole Allspice\n* 5g (2 tsp) Whole Caraway Seed\n* 6g (2 tsp) Whole Black Peppercorn\n* 40g (4 tbsp) Kosher Salt \\*1 tbsp per lb of protein\n* 10g (1 tbsp) Cane Sugar\n* 45ml (3 tbsp) Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 45ml (3 tbsp) Ice Water \\*add more for smoother texture\n\n\\*Toast appropriate spices then blend together. \n\n*BEER GRAVY BRAISED BRATS...*\n\n* 6-8 Bratwurst\n* 570g (2 whole) Yellow Onions\n* 15g (1-2 cloves) Garlic, minced\n* 2g (2 tsp) Black Pepper, ground\n* 3g (1 tsp) Paprika\n* 12g (2 tsp) Dark Brown Sugar\n* 12oz (1 can) Dark Beer \\*Oktoberfest is best\n* 42g (3 tbsp) Unsalted Butter\n* 8g (1 tbsp) AP Flour \n* Kosher Salt to taste\n* Optional Mustard/Sauerkraut\n\n*BEER MUSTARD*\n\n* 1/ 2 cup Yellow Mustard Seed\n* 1/ 2 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1 cup Dark Beer (Oktoberfest Marzen Lager)\n* 1/ 2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 2 tbsp Dark Brown Sugar\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n\\*Let beer/mustard/vinegar soak for a day in fridge then blitz in blender.\n\n\\*ferment 2-3 days submerged and covered at room temp.\n\n\\*Store in the fridge for 1-2 months.\n\n*SAUERKRAUT*\n\n* 2lb Cabbage/Veg\n* 1 tbsp Kosher Salt\n* Seasonings - dried herbs, spices, etc.\n\n\\*ferment 3-30 days submerged and covered at room temp\n\n\\*Store in the fridge indefinitely. Use common sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTECHNIQUE FOR SAUSAGE MAKING...\n\n1. Place all meat grinder equipment in freezer for at least 30 minutes. Soak hog casing in water for 30 mins.\n   1. Make sure casings are the right size. Some come packed in salt, so rinse the casings with water if that\u2019s the case for you. Any good butcher should sell hog casings.\n2. Dice meat and fat into small cubes, place on metal sheet tray then transfer to the freezer for 20 minutes or so.\n   1. The meat is easier to work with and holds its texture when cold, easier on your stand mixer. Making sure everything that touches the meat is cold ensures a healthy saaaasage. That fat will separate from the meat if warm - Stella culinary \n3. Measure out the spices and herbs. Toast appropriate spices on stovetop, then transfer to grinder and blend. Work spices mixture into cubed meat until evenly coated. Set aside.\n   1. Don\u2019t toast the dried herbs, they burn easily.\n4. Remove the grinder components and chilled meat from the freezer. Set the grinder up on the stand mixer with a half pan underneath to catch the meat.\n5. Insert the coarse die (8mm) and run the machine on level 2 one time letting the ground meat fall into the pan.\n   1. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bowl is super cold. However, if you\u2019d like to run the meat through the grinder again for a finer grind, chill the ground meat and grinder for 10-20 mins, then have at it a second time.\n6. Pour cold water and vinegar into the bowl with the ground meat mixture and mix with paddle attachment until the meat and fat slightly emulsify, or with a food processor if you have one.\n7. Once mixed thoroughly, attach the appropriate sausage stuffer attachment. Load the grinder and hopper up with ground meat and run it on low speed until meat comes out the end. Once meat comes out the end, turn off the stuffer and slide on your pre-soaked hog casings.\n   1. Large stuffing tube for big casings, small for skinnier casings.\n8. Hog casing on the stuffer nozzle, and meat pushed to the end, tie off a knot on the casing and begin sausage stuffing process on low heat. Use one hand to plunge in the ground meat mixture and the other to finesse the sausage as it comes out the end.\n   1. We don\u2019t want any airholes in the sausage that could lead to bursting when tying or cooking.\n   2. Don\u2019t stuff the sausages too too much or they\u2019ll be hard to twist off.\n9. Once all meat has been sausage-ified, cut off any remaining hog casing. Use a needle or cake tester to prick small holes all over the sausage to release any air bubbles.\n   1. Save extra hog casing in a container packed with salt and refrigerate. They\u2019ll last for a long time. Up to 6 months I\u2019ve read.\n10. Cook right away, or leave uncovered in the fridge for casings to dry out and flavors to meld overnight. Your call.\n   1. Serve brats with a good bun, a bit of spicy mustard, and if feeling festive some homemade sauerkraut. Orrrrrr make beer braised brats by doing the following\u2026\n   2. Brats should last in the fridge for 4-5 days, or frozen for a couple months.\n\nTECHNIQUE FOR BEER BRAISED BRATS...\n\n1. Add a bit of oil to cast iron, brown brats and flip then remove from pan.\n2. Add sliced onions to pan. Season with salt. Cook onions over medium heat stirring until they\u2019re about 25% caramelized, 10 or so minutes minutes.\n3. Once caramelized add butter, garlic, black pepper, paprika, brown sugar. Stir until incorporated then add flour to the spiced onion mixture and stir in again. Cook for 1-2 more minutes. \n4. Once mixed, stir in dark beer (oktoberfest preferably). At this step you can also add optional mustard and sauerkraut. Mix the stock and beer into the seasoned onions and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes until slightly reduced.\n5. After 5 minutes the liquid should be slightly reduced, introduce brats back into the pan with the onion braising liquid and cook until the beer gravy is thick enough to your liking and brats are cooked to at least 165F or 74c. \n6. Optional parsley or fennel frond garnish\n7. Serve with more sauerkraut and mustard. Bun and mashed potatoes optional.\n\n**Easy Homemade Bratwurst & How to Cook Beer Brats**  \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "created_utc": 1600873436.0, "score": 34, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Split Pea Soup with Home-Cured Ham", "selftext": "Split pea soup is a popular way to use leftover ham for a good reason. It's chunky, rich and tasty. The smoke lent from a good leftover ham bone or fresh ham hock lends a smokey, porky taste that's hard to find in other vegetable-based soups. Split pea begins its journey in a solid state, with hard split peas and other lone ingredients scattered about, then over the long simmering process things change and the soup turns into the creamy, puree we all know and love.\n\nI made a giant ham from scratch a few weeks back so I was sitting on a leftover femur, aiche and shank bone... what better way to utilize the bones and leftover stew meat than making Split Pea Soup!? I ended up making a big batch of soup, saving some to eat throughout the week and freezing the rest for a quick dinner later in the month.\n\nBelow you'll find the ingredients and technique for my Split Pea Soup recipe. As usual, I'll also include a link to a video to those of you who prefer something visual. Feel free to sub out yellow split peas for green, and to use a fresh smoked ham hock or something similar if you don't have leftover ham bones in your freezer (likely the majority of you.) I hope this helps!\n\n**Split Pea Soup INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter (30g)\n* 1 Yellow Onion, diced (320g)\n* 5 Celery Stalks, diced (140g)\n* 4 Medium Carrots, peeled + diced (205g)\n* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced (8g)\n* 1/ 2 cup Dry Sherry Wine (125ml) \\*see note\n* 1 lb Dried Split Peas (454g)\n* 8 cups Chicken Stock (1893ml)\n* 2 cups Ham, shredded or diced (260g) \\*see note\n* 5 sprigs Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Fresh Bay Leaves\n* Ham Bones - femur, shank and aiche \\*see note\n\n*Salt + Pepper TT*\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n*\\*Feel free to use store-bought ham, or sub for fresh thick-cut bacon.*\n\n*\\*\\*Pork stock can be subbed for Chicken. Just make sure it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d stock and has plenty of collagen.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Sub Dry Sherry Wine for white wine, or Madeira wine.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Whole ham bones are optional, but do make a big difference in the soups flavor. Ask your butcher for leftover bones, or sub out for a smoked ham hock.*\n\n**Split Pea Soup Technique:**\n\n1. Start the ham bone. Roast the ham bone in a 500F oven until charred and roasty. About 10-15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.\n2. Add butter to dutch oven, season and sweat mirepoix and garlic until onions and celery are translucent. About 10 minutes.\n3. Deglaze dutch oven with wine, cook off the wine until the wine reduces by half. About 4 minutes.\n4. Add dried split peas to dutch oven along with thyme and bay leaves. Season with black pepper and mix.\n5. Add the chicken stock and roasted ham bones if using. Simmer the soup, uncovered for 1 hour and 45 mins.\n   1. Be careful when seasoning, the soup will reduce and the ham is already pretty salty.\n   2. Over time the split peas will fall apart giving the soup its classic, thick split pea look.\n6. Add the ham pieces and continue simmering for another 15 minutes.\n7. After two hours, remove the soup from the heat and let cool. Serve with creme fraiche, crusty bread, and more ham pieces if you\u2019re feeling like a big boy.\n8. Split pea soup can be kept in the fridge for 3 or 4 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.\n\n**Split Pea Soup (with Home-cured Ham) -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "created_utc": 1610556244.0, "score": 35, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "App to track you pantry / food inventory?", "selftext": "Hello /r/FromScratch ! I am a senior Computer Information Systems student and would love your help designing an app!  \n&nbsp;  \nThe basis of the app is to track the amount of food you have on hand and optionally, the price you paid for that food. I believe that this app could be extremely useful for making things from scratch because it would allow you to be at the store and know what you have already in the house. Potentially saving you money and allowing you to make more items from scratch. What I am looking for is your feedback in the form of a really quick survey about what you would like to see in an app like this. Or, if it even useful at all to you. (Any feedback is welcome!) I also encourage you to comment below, I will be very active with replying to any feedback, questions, etc. The survey is 100% anonymous, unless you enter your email for the mailing list.  \n&nbsp;  \n**If you're already interested, here is the survey:** https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvLGR6fAoJOo1FHG9v6hsXZjP4GBPTQ3liK3pibff9LpZwqQ/viewform  \nBelow is more information about the app and the philosophy behind it.  \n&nbsp;  \n**My philosophy for this apps progress:**\n\n&nbsp;  \n1) **Make your life better, not hinder it**. The first question that comes to people's mind is, \"How will I update my pantry of food?\" \n\nMy current ideas for this are:\n\n- Manually, as you eat the food subtract it from your inventory\n\n- As you add items to a shopping list the app prompts for an updated inventory quantity\n\n- When you scan a receipt in, it asks for updated quantities of matching receipts/inventory items\n\nIf you have an idea for this please feel free to comment here or add it to the survey!\n\n&nbsp;  \n2) **Design.** I will be sticking to the full slate of design standards for the operating system that the app is on. Whether that be Android, iOS, or desktop, my goal is to make this app look appealing and seamless ad well as efficient.\n\n&nbsp;  \n3) **No ads. No pay walls for main features**. I am not going into this app looking for money. I am trying to solve a problem that I have in my everyday life (more on that later.) I would rather have a beautifully designed app that everyone uses for free rather than a beautifully designed app that no one uses because it costs too much money. Now, this isn't a guarantee that there won't be some kind of payment in the future. Servers do cost money (if the app ever needed them) but the core features of this app, tracking food inventory, will always be free to use, and ad-free.\n\n&nbsp;  \nIf this is something you're interested in please fill the survey out where you can input your email to get more information as it becomes available!\n\nThanks for your time!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "created_utc": 1487867741.0, "score": 27, "author": "klutch2013", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "html_title": ""}

I used weight for the flour as I find it more consistent.\n\n* 00 wheat flour (Antimo Caputo) - 500g or 3+3/4 cup\n* Room temp Water - 310g/mL or 1+1/2 cup\n* Pure Honey - 10g or 2 tsp\n* Salt (kosher diamond crystal) - 10g or 2+1/2 tsp\n* Vital Wheat Gluten (red mill) - 2.5g or 1+1/2 tsp\n* Active Dry Yeast (Antimo Caputo) - 2.5g or 3/4 tsp\n\nMix everything in a bowl (adding water last) using bread hook on medium for 5 minutes. Rest for 10 minutes at room temp and mix 5 more minutes. Cut into 2,3,4 smaller sections. Stretch for about 30 seconds and roll into nice round ball. Use grape seed oil to lightly oil a bowl, put the dough inside and flip over so both sides are oiled. Put a plastic wrap overtop and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or best off do it for 1 day. \n\nMake sure to take out 1 hour ahead of time. Heat up oven to 500 degrees and heat up pizza stone inside. Transfer pizza and cook for 4-8 minutes depending on size.\n\nEnjoy! As a note I used olive oil on the crust (Partana extra virgin). I think it brought some extra flavor.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kiklmk/modern_cuisine_at_home_neopolitan_pizza_dough/", "created_utc": 1608692372.0, "score": 29, "author": "dragons_fire77", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kiklmk/modern_cuisine_at_home_neopolitan_pizza_dough/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Using a Dried Gourd to Make Pasta", "selftext": "I came across a video within the last couple of months that showed a woman making pasta by putting the dough in a dried out gourd that looked about the size of a small pot with the handle being a part of the gourd. There were holes in the bottom of the gourd uniform in size. (She had a wall where many different gourds were hanging that had holes of various sizes). Once the dough was in she held it over a bowl and patted on the dough until it was coming out of all of the holes then did a little swish with her wrist to cut off the flow before quickly moving it over a pot of boiling water. She was hitting the end of the handle with her wrist I believe to make the dough flow through the holes at an even rate. It made the most perfect looking noodles. \n\nI recently went looking for this again thinking it would be easy to find, but after 20 minutes of searching I've had no luck. Maybe my brain is fried and I just can't think of the perfect word combination to bring me the search result I'm looking for. So now here I am looking for someone else who has either seen this video and knows the correct terms for this type of cooking, has a link to the video, or really any information on this style! \n\nI just planted some giant bottle gourd seeds and was hoping to find out how to make the tool and a recipe for the noodles. If nothing else, I'll be winging it until I figure it out! The video made quite an impression on me and I've remembered quite a bit from it!\n\nThank you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/gsirz2/using_a_dried_gourd_to_make_pasta/", "created_utc": 1590713606.0, "score": 27, "author": "None", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/gsirz2/using_a_dried_gourd_to_make_pasta/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Home-Cured Corned Beef (for St. Patrick's Day)", "selftext": "When I think of corned beef the first thing I think of is a corned beef deli sandwich. Rye bread stacked high with corned beef, some grainy mustard and melted cheese... it's a glorious thing. Not until this year did I ever question how corned beef was made, but I'm glad I did. It turns out that making corned beef at home is pretty easy, all it takes is a bit of simple math and some patience.\n\nAfter some testing, I've come up on what I believe to be a pretty decent spice blend, cure ratio and end result and I'm stoked to share it with you all. Below you'll find the measurements and technique to make your own corned beef, from the ground up. For my visual people, I've also included a link to a cook-along video. Let me know if you have any questions here in the comments, I'm happy to help if I can. Good luck.\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 8-10 lb Beef Brisket \u201cflat\u201d, trimmed\n* Curing Salts (see below)\n* Corned Beef Spice Blend:\n* 3/ 4 cup Coriander (60g)\n* 3/ 4 cup Black Pepper (100g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Caraway Seed (25g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Brown Mustard Seed (50g)\n* 1/ 3 cup Star Anise (30g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Whole Mace (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Clove (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Allspice Berries (10g)\n* 2 tbsp Juniper Berry (10g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Chili Flake (15g)\n* 5 Fresh Bay Leaves (2 dry)\n* 1 Cinnamon stick (2.5g)\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\n1. Weight out spices, toast over low heat, then transfer to a mortar and pestle to crush. Remove half of the spice blend and set aside until we\u2019re ready to cook.\n2. Fill large container with water, take the waters weight, then add 5% salt and 3% brown sugar to it. Then add half the spice blend and stir until mixed well. Finally, add brisket and submerge. Use a ceramic bowl or non-reactive, food-safe thing to weigh the brisket down. Cover and label. Let sit in the fridge for 7-10 days, flipping the meat and stirring once daily.\n3. After 7-10 days remove corned beef from brine, rinse under running water. Discard brine. \n4. Place the brisket in a large pot, and pour in enough water to cover by a couple inches. Blanch meat for 5-10 minutes and skim off the scum that rises to the top.\n5. Once most of the scum is gone, add the remaining spice mix, crushed garlic and ginger then bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook, covered for 3-4 hours or until the brisket is fork tender. \n6. Towards the end, around hour 3 of the cooking process, add in red potatoes, carrots and cabbage then cover and simmer until tender, about 30-45 minutes.\n7. If the veggies finish cooking before the brisket, remove them and set aside until ready to serve.\n8. Once the beef is easily pierce-able with a knife, remove it from the pot and set it out on a sheet tray to cool slightly. \n9. Slice corned beef against the grain, on the bias. Serve with grainy mustard or mustard vinaigrette, the boiled vegetables from earlier, and dark beer.\n\n**TO MEASURE SALTS AND SUGAR...**\n\n* 5% Kosher Salt (of water weight) =\n   * (.05) \\* Water Weight in grams = Kosher Salt needed\n* 3% Brown Sugar (of water weight) =\n   * (.03) \\* Water Weight in grams = Sugar needed\n* Pink Salt should equal .50% of the total weight of the meat\u2026\n   * My brisket = 8lb = 3624g\u2026\n   * ...pink salt (.005)\\*3624 = 18.12g\n\n***How to Make Home-Cured Corned Beef -*** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc\\_IVKvddPM&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc_IVKvddPM&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "created_utc": 1614795698.0, "score": 26, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Homemade Lasagna with Bolognese", "selftext": "Lasagna is a classic dish that can tell you a lot about a cook. There are dozens of ways to make the Italian classic... from utilizing different pasta types to adding all sorts of vegetables, or simply opting for a ragu of sorts and cheese. Making lasagna from scratch calls to a cooks ability to make a decent ragu (meat sauce), make homemade pasta sheets, and, if one opts for it, getting creative with the way the \"casserole\" is layered.\n\nBelow is my adaptation on a \"classic\" lasagna. If you want to have a whack at making it, I've left the technique and measurement list (in both weights and Imperial). I'll also go ahead and link to a video that I created for those of you who prefer something visual. I spent a lot of time on this, so I hope it helps you save some of your own! Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck!\n\n**RECIPE** (Serves 8...)\n\nFor Lasagna\u2026\n\n* 5.5 cups (200g) Parmigiano Reggiano\n* 1.5 cups (80g) Low-Moisture, full-fat Mozzarella\n* Fresh Basil and/or Parsley TT - garnish\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n* 4 cups (510g) Type \u201c00\u201d Flour\n* 4 (230g) Whole Eggs\n* 5 (90g) Egg Yolks\n\nBechamel (\u201cbesciamella\u201d)\u2026\n\n* 2 tbsp (30g) Butter\n* 3 tbsp (30g) Flour\n* 2 cups (474ml) Whole Milk\n* 1 cup (25g) Parmigiano Reggiano, grated\n* Ground Nutmeg TT\n* Salt & Pepper TT\n\nItalian Sausage Ragu \u201cBolognese\u201d...\n\n(Makes 10-12 servings)\n\n* 4 tbsp (60g) Butter\n* 1lb (454g) Italian Pork Sausage\n* 1lb (454g) Ground Beef Chuck\n* 1 large Onion/ 1.5 cups (320g)\n* 3 large Ribs Celery/ 1 cup (100g)\n* 2 large Carrots/ 1 cup (125g)\n* 5 cloves of garlic, minced (8g)\n* 28oz can San Marzano tomatoes (828ml)\n* 1.5 cups White Wine (355ml)\n* 2 cups Whole Milk (474ml)\n* 2 cups Veal or Beef Stock (474ml)\n* Herb Sachet - Fresh Thyme, Oregano, Bay leaf\n* Chili Flakes TT\n* Fish Sauce TT\n* (optional) Rinds from Parmigiano Reggiano TT\n\nTT= to taste\n\n\\*This recipe makes more Ragu than you\u2019re going to need for the lasagna. The ragu freezes well and will stay fresh for 3-5 months in the freezer.\n\n\\*\\*You could end up with extra pasta sheets, too. It\u2019s better to have some left over, then to be short on sheets. If you have leftover, cut the sheets into any shape you want and chill in an air-tight container. Boom. Fresh pasta for later in the week.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n1. Make a mound with the flour and use your fingers to create a well.\n2. Drop the whole eggs and egg yolks in the middle, whisk with a fork, and slowly begin collapsing in flour into the beaten egg and egg yolk mixture.\n3. Once the eggs have been worked into the flour, drop the fork and begin kneading by hand.\n4. Knead for 5-10 minutes, or until the dough is smoothed out.  \n\n   1. Add in a sprinkle or two of water if the dough is looking a bit dry.\n5. Wrap in plastic and set aside. Let rest for 30 minutes.  \n\n   1. Allowing the dough the time to rest will make it more supple, and easier to work with. If you don\u2019t let it rest, it will remain hard to roll out and pull back on you.\n6. Flour a sheet tray heavily and set it aside at the ready.\n7. After 30 minutes remove the plastic from the pasta and portion out into 4 quarters.\n8. Grab one quarter from the bunch, and cover the remaining pasta chunks with the plastic wrap so that they don\u2019t dry out.\n9. Form the pasta chunk into a 5-6 inch circle, dust with flour, then run the dough through the pasta machine starting at width 0.\n10. After the first pass, fold the two ends over each other, and run it through again. Repeat one or two more times.\n11. One the sheet is flat and even, increase the pasta machine width to setting 1, flour the dough again, then run the dough through. Repeat this process working your way up to setting 6.\n12. You should be able to see the silhouette of your hand through the dough.\n13. Skimping on flouring the pasta dough as you run it through the machine could lead you to torn pasta sheets. Flour is important.\n14. Place the WELL FLOURED pasta sheets back onto a sheet tray as you work.\n15. Once the pasta sheet are rolled out, portion the sheets into 13 inch long pieces (big enough to fit in your cooking vessel), flour, and set aside again.\n16. Cook the sheets in well-seasoned water for 30-45 seconds, or until just cooked but still al dente.\n17. As the sheets finish cooking, place them on the rack and sprinkle with oil to avoid sticking and overlap.\n18. Do this step lastly, right before you\u2019re ready to build the lasagne.\n\nRagu Bolognese\u2026\n\n1. Form ground meat into sausage patties, season with salt, and brown in a dutch oven, Once browned, reserve on a plate.\n2. Drain a bit of the excess fat from the dutch oven, melt the butter then add in your carrots, celery, onion and garlic. Cook the veg down for 5-10 minutes.\n3. Add the reserved browned ground meat back into the dutch oven and crumble using the back of a wooden spoon or something similar.\n4. Once the veg and meat mixture is crumbled, deglaze the bottom of the pan with the white wine, scraping all the brown bits off the bottom of the dutch oven. Cook the mixture on high heat until the wine reduces by nearly half. 7-8 minutes.\n5. Once the wine is reduced, add the milk. Again, cook over high heat until the milk is near fully reduced, another 10 minutes or so.\n6. Once the mixture is almost dry, pour in the San Marzano tomatoes and veal stock and stir until combined.\n7. Finally, add in the herb sachet, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2-4 hours.  \n\n   1. The longer its simmered, the more flavorful it will be.\n8. After time simmering, optionally pulse the bolognese with an immersion blender to get a smooth yet textured consistency.  \n\n   1. The bolognese will be significantly reduced after simmering for so long. Feel free to add in more stock or water for a looser consistency. I prefer to leave mine reduced for a chunkier sauce.\n   2. Control the finally consistency of your ragu by pulsing it as much or as little as you like with an immersion blender.\n   3. The immersion blender allows texture control, but also helps emulsify some of the fat in the sauce into the liquid giving a gorgeous light orangish-brown color to the ragu.\n9. Once the desired consistency is achieved, season the sauce with fish sauce, salt, and pepper TT, put the lid on the dutch oven, and set aside.\n\nBechamel...\n\n1. Add butter and flour to a medium saucepan and cook for 5 minutes, or until the roux smells like pie crust - Chef John.\n2. Slowly whisk in COLD milk (no lumps), then grate in nutmeg, salt and pepper TT. Optionally add a bit of parm to the bechamel (technically making it into a mornay sauce.)\n3. Bring the mixture up to a boil, then cut the heat. When the Roux begins to bubble is when it\u2019s at its maximum thickening power. If your roux looks too thin, start over.\n4. Let cool for a few minutes, then lay some plastic wrap over the top of the bechamel and cover with a lid so a skin doesn\u2019t form, set it aside.\n\nTo assemble Lasagne\u2026\n\n1. Lay down a bit of bolognese and bechamel then the first layer of pasta.\n2. Lay down another layer of bolognese, bechamel, AND parmesan cheese. Finish with more pasta sheets to cover. Rinse and repeat.  \n\n   1. You should still be able to see the bottom pasta sheet once the bolognese is ladeled in, don\u2019t overdo the sauces in each layer.\n3. Finish the lasagne by pulling over two of the sheets to form a \u201cbowl\u201d then lay on the remaining bechamel sauce, a dollop of red sauce (mostly for color) and a little more parm.\n4. Cover with parchment paper, then tin foil and bake at 400F for 35 minutes.\n5. After 35 minutes, remove the parchment and foil, sprinkle on the mozzarella cheese and broil for 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and browned.\n6. Let rest for AT LEAST 30 minutes before slicing and serving.  \n\n   1. If you cut into the lasagne early, it\u2019ll still taste great\u2026 but you might get 3rd degree burns on the roof of your mouth and it could fall apart on you making all the layer work you just did worthless. Butttt it\u2019s your call, I won\u2019t get between a hungry human and a lasagne.\n7. Garnish with chopped parsley and basil.\n\n**A Guide to Homemade Lasagna (from scratch)** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "created_utc": 1611166989.0, "score": 22, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Question about the focus of /r/fromscratch.", "selftext": "Hi /r/fromscratch,\n\nI've discovered you the other day, and I think this subreddit has great potential. I've recently tried my hands on making [fries](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/05/perfect-french-fries-recipe.html) with [mayo](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/dining/easy-homemade-mayonnaise.html?pagewanted=all) fromscratch, with great success if I may say so myself (I'll post those links in a sec). Today I've made tagliatelle for the first time. They were a bit too thick, but I digress. The point is, I'm currently discovering that a lot of things I used to buy readymade in the supermarket are fun and surprisingly easy to do myself. And that's why I'm very happy that this subreddit exists and looking forward to trying many of the things posted here.\n\nWhat concerns me, though, is that sometimes subreddits are being held back from achieving the greatness they deserve because the focus isn't clear and they risk losing what sets them apart from other, existing large subreddits. Yes, there isn't a lot of traffic in here (yet), but the early posts set the tone.\n\nTo finally get to what I mean, do things that are *commonly* being made from scratch qualify, or is the focus on things that most people don't *usually* make fromscratch?\n\nFor example, take cakes. It's great what you've all been cooking up, but at least where I'm from, that's just normal [(/r/)baking](http://www.reddit.com/r/baking). There is a lot of overlap with places like /r/breadit and generally /r/cooking in here, where you can reach a much wider audience and get better feedback from people who really know their stuff.  \nI know there aren't many posts in here, but as a new subscriber, what's the value this subreddit is addidng for me? Will it just clutter up my subscription list? Or will it be a place that inspires me when I have some time and feel like trying new things on my own?\n\nSorry if this is coming across the wrong way, I know I'm the new guy and haven't added anything of value yet myself. I just really like the idea of this subreddit, at least the way I understood it.\n\nSo, what does everybody think?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/v623f/question_about_the_focus_of_rfromscratch/", "created_utc": 1339908715.0, "score": 22, "author": "CountVonTroll", "num_comments": 33, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/v623f/question_about_the_focus_of_rfromscratch/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Simple Brown Veal Stock (with How-to video)", "selftext": "What's up everyone,\n\nHave you ever wondered how to make homemade stock, or have you made your own in the past?\n\nHomemade stock is worlds better/cheaper than store-bought stuff. Keeping a freezer with homemade stock reserves on deck is a surefire way to elevate your cooking at home - think restaurant quality soups, braises, flavor-packed grain dishes or reduction sauces and more. \n\nStock making is a staple, straight-forward technique that every passionate cook should be familiar with (even if you're ballin' on a budget.) The written recipe and notes are listed below. However if you're more of a visual learner I recommend checking out the video here -[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrown veal stock is simply a liquid made by slowly simmering ingredients in water and extracting flavors into liquid form. Stock is a powerful flavor base that has a load of different functions in the kitchen. I don\u2019t know many things\u2026 but one thing that I do know for sure is that preparing your own stock with vegetables, animal bones, and aromatics will not only teach you an important lesson in the kitchen, but it will also elevate whatever you usually cook with the store-bought stuff. \n\nThere are many different types of stocks from brown to white, fish to veal, but today we\u2019re going to focus in on, what I feel, is the most delicious and kitchen-life-changing: brown veal stock. To call a stock, \u201cbrown\u201d simply means that the animal bones and vegetables are roasted/charred in a hot oven before they are simmered; also a tomato product such as tomato paste is generally added for acidity, sweetness, and color (though not always.) A \u201cwhite\u201d stock simply means that the stock ingredients are not roasted before they are simmered - no color, in most cases, means less flavor. So for the sake of running through a stock-making technique, I wanted to focus on one that achieves deep flavor - brown veal stock. \n\nI\u2019m going to explain my method below. But be sure to read the extra \u201cImportant Notes\u201d at the bottom of the page. Whatever I didn\u2019t cover in the method or video will be listed down there. Let\u2019s get to it... \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 10 lbs veal bones (try and find knuckle bones)   \n \n* 3 oz (\u00bd cup) grapeseed oil (or any high-heat, neutral cooking oil)   \n \n* 1 lbs onions (4-5 medium), I like to use yellow but use what\u2019s on hand   \n \n* 8 oz carrots (1.5 large), chopped with skin on   \n \n* 8 oz celery (4-6 stalks), chopped   \n \n* Tomato paste, 1 small can10 black peppercorns   \n \n* \u00bd bunch of parsley   \n \n* \u00bd bunch thyme   \n \n* 2-3 bay leaves   \n \n* 2-3 garlic cloves   \n \n* fresh water, to cover   \n \n* \u00bd cup dry red wine   \n \n\n**Method:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Start by rubbing the veal bones with grapeseed oil. Some people scoff at using oil, but I find that it helps the bones achieve solid browning. Plus if you do a good job skimming, it\u2019s easy to deal with.   \n \n2. Next, roast in a pre-heated 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C oven for 1 hour, or until they turn deep golden brown in color. Make sure to rotate the bones half way through to make sure things char evenly.   \n \n3. Meanwhile, prepare your Mirepoix like you did the bones, by rubbing the vegetables with oil. I don\u2019t like to peel my carrots or onions - the skin has a ton of flavor locked inside.   \n \n4. Once the time has passed, check on your bones, they should have some beautiful color. Remove them from the oven and rub with the tomato paste until covered, but not plastered on. You probably don\u2019t have to use the entire can of paste. Place the tomato covered bones back in oven for another 20-25 minutes until the tomato paste starts to caramelize.   \n \n5. To be efficient with your time, start roasting off your mirepoix with your tomato-smeared bones on a separate tray. Though they likely won\u2019t be finished at the same time as your bones, it\u2019s good to get things rolling.   \n \n6. Place bones in a large, heavy bottomed stockpot.   \n \n7. Place the tray used to roast our bones over the stove and heat over medium-high. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, or water and use a wooden spoon to scrape the crispy bits stuck to the tray. Technically these crispies are known as \u201cfond.\u201d Pour the wine and fond mixture into the stockpot with the bones.   \n \n8. By now, your mirepoix should be getting there. Once finished and charred, add the mirepoix to the stockpot.   \n \n9. Fill the stockpot with enough cold water to cover the bones by at least 2-3 inches. Using cold water encourages a clearer stock. If you don\u2019t care about the clarity, use warm or hot water. Just make sure the water you\u2019re using is high-quality and clean.   \n \n10. Once hot, add the peppercorns, parsley, thyme, garlic and bay leaf. Some people like to wrap these aromatics in cheese cloth with twine known as a \u201csachet\u201d, but I don\u2019t see a need to do so. We\u2019re going to strain everything out at the end, so it seems redundant to me. But if you want to wrap things up in a cute lil\u2019 bundle, please, be my guest.   \n \n11. Heat stock over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to low and maintain a slow simmer. Do not allow the stock to boil or it will emulsify the remaining fat from the bones and make things clouded. \\*See note for \u201cthe oven trick.\u201d   \n \n12. Simmer for 8-12 hours, skimming with a ladle as necessary. Skimming is VERY important and you can\u2019t forget to do it or else your stock will be a foggy, fatty, sloppy mess. To skim, simply dip a ladle in the stock and remove any built up protein particles, fat and other scum. I like to do this every hour at least once, but I might be a little obsessive. A cool hack that allows for easier skimming is to pull the stockpot halfway off the heat. The fat and scum will collect to one side in a cycle, making things easier to skim.   \n \n13. After the stock is finished, strain through a course strainer (\u201cchina cap\u201d) and then through a fine mesh strainer (\u201cchinois.\u201d) \\*See YouTube video for links to purchase the same gear I use in the video.   \n \n\n\\*\\*\\* If you don\u2019t plan to use the stock immediately, store in fridge for up to 5 days or freeze any leftover stock - it\u2019ll stay good for up to 3 months. I like to keep them in labeled deli containers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Important Notes:* \n\nSTOCK IS A FLAVOR BASE; stock is used to make other dishes and is often reduced down to concentrate flavor. This means that you shouldn\u2019t season it with salt at any step during the cooking process; also, refrain from using any strong/overpowering ingredients. Keep the stock pure so that flavors can be added as needed to create specific dishes/sauces - shoutout to all my people with commitment issues. \n\nBROTH vs. STOCK: Simply put, broth is made of meat and stock is made from bones. Broth is generally lighter whereas stock is rich and has more body (a heavier mouthfeel) due to the collagen in the bones which, throughout the cooking process, breaks down into gelatin. \n\nBONES. Speaking of collagen\u2026 I like to use knuckle bones for veal stock. Generally, knuckle bones have much more collagen ready to be unlocked into gelatin from within. Though I\u2019m not afraid to throw in some marrow bones and/or meat scraps in my stock pot along with the knuckle bones. When making poultry stock look for backs, wings and necks as these all contain a buttload of collagen, too. \n\n\u201cTHE OVEN TRICK\u201d - One way to keep your stove range free of clutter is to simmer stock in the oven. Simply set your oven to 200F (93c) and place your stock pot inside once all of your ingredients and water have been added. I\u2019ve made stock this way a few times, but there are pros and cons. A couple pros are that your kitchen has less clutter and your stove is free to cook other things on and you can leave the oven on through the night and simmer the stock for the 8-12 hours while you sleep. The cons are that it\u2019s sort of a pain in the ass to continuously move the stock pot from the oven to the stovetop to skim off the protein aggregates, fat and other scum. I typically make my stock the traditional way, on the stove, but the oven trick works, too. Play around with both techniques and see which you prefer. \n\nWHAT IS \u201cMIREPOIX?\u201d Mirepoix is just a fancy French word for a flavor base of carrots/celery and onion. The classic ratio is 2 parts onion: 1 part celery: 1 part carrots. A good rule of thumb is for every 5 pounds of bones, use 1 pound of mirepoix. \n\nUSE QUALITY WATER! If you live in a spot with hard water, or just bad water in general, use store-bought stuff either bottled or in the jug. Make sure to use cold water to start your stock if you want it to be clearer and less foggy - this won\u2019t affect the taste, however. \n\nAROMATICS. The aromatics that I like to use in my veal/beef stock include bay leaf, parsley, thyme, black peppercorns and garlic. The amount in which you use is all preference based. \n\n\u201cREDUCTION,\u201d is a technique used to reinforce flavor. Veal stock isn\u2019t always used as is, but is generally reduced by half with the addition of mirepoix and aromatics. This is done to concentrate flavor and provide a more viscous mouth feel (give the stock \u201cbody\u201d). Check out my \u201cEasy Pan Sauce\u201d video to see how I reduce veal stock into a yummy, complex steak sauce. \n\nWHITE STOCK vs. BROWN STOCK. To make a white veal stock, simply rinse the veal bones with cold water. Place the rinsed bones in your stockpot with cold water and bring to a simmer. After this blanching phase, pour off the water and keep the veal bones in the stockpot. Doing this will allow any protein particles and other scum to detach from the bones giving you a cleaner, more delicate stock. Once your bones are blanched, simply follow the steps in this recipe but skip over the pre-simmer roasting process for the animal bones and mirepoix. This same method can be used for poultry stocks, as well. Though, as I mentioned, I highly recommend making brown stock as they are MUCH MORE FLAVORFUL. If you\u2019re going to spend your hard earned cash on quality ingredients, wouldn\u2019t you want to conjure the tastiest stock?

(You want the tomato mixture in the pot to be moist, but thick and gooey.)\n\nRemove the pot from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes or so.\n\nWorking in batches, put the tomatoe mixture through a food mill or press through a sturdy mesh strainer, collecting the sauce in a glass or plastic bowl.\n\nTaste the collected sauce and add salt and pepper to taste.\n\nIf you're using the sauce right away, simmer it for several minutes in a large saucepan before serving.

{"title": "Homemade Mustard from Scratch (3 Ways)", "selftext": "I never thought for a second to make homemade Dijon mustard, however now that I have a few pounds of corned beef on my hands I decided to do a deep dive into the world of mustards. What I came up on were dozens of recipes for dozens of different types of mustard. What was left after the mental distillation process were these 3 mustards: a refined and smooth \"Dijon-style\" mustard, a whole grain sweeter mustard made with beer, and a classic \"English\" style mustard made with yellow mustard powder. Each of these mustards has a time and place and I recommend giving them all a go! Below you'll find the recipes and techniques for each, plus a technique video for those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck!\n\n**French \u201cDijon\u201d Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 3/4 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/4 cup Dry White Wine\n* 2 tbsp White Wine Vinegar\n* 1-3 tbsp Water\n* 2 tsp Salt\n* 2 tsp Sugar\n\n1. Soak seeds overnight in enough water to cover.\n2. Drain seeds, place in mortar and pestle. Mash until the yellow seeds come out of the husks. This will take some time (about 10 mins.)\n3. Once you really begin to see the yellow seeds, slowly start incorporating the wine.\n4. Once all the wine is in, add the salt and sugar then slowly incorporate the vinegar. Grind until the mixture becomes fine.\n5. Once fine, adjust seasoning. Adding sweetness (sugar) will cut the bitterness, adding acid (vinegar/wine) will reduce the \u201cheat.\u201d\n6. Pass the mixture through a fine mesh sieve using the back of a spoon. Optionally, pass it through twice for a super smooth, yellow Dijon mustard.\n7. Store and refrigerate the mustard for a couple days before using. Doing so will allow the mustard to \u201cmature\u201d and reduce its heat.\n\n**English Style Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 1/2 cup Mustard Powder (Colman\u2019s Brand) \\*loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Water\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Sugar \n* 1/2 tsp Salt\n\n1. Whisk all ingredients together. Let stand for 15 minutes to thicken. Serve immediately. Seal and refrigerate to store.\n\n**Whole Grain Mustard (Beer Mustard)...**\n\n* 1/4 cup Yellow Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 cup Beer, divided\n* 5 tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 tsp Salt\n\n1. Soak the seeds with the vinegar and 1/ 2 cup of beer. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\n2. In a small sauce pan, mix the remaining 1/ 2 cup of beer with the sugar, salt and turmeric. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from the stove and let cool to room temperature.\n3. Into a blender, pour the mustard seeds and the soaking liquid and the beer syrup mixture.

So, working with what I had: mexican rice, cheese, tortillas, and enchilada sauce, one knife, one fork, one cast iron skillet, I made this taco.   On a paper towel.\n\n#The Taco\n\nI poured in a thin coat of untoasted sesame oil into my skillet and gave the tortilla a little browning and char on each side.   Set aside tortilla, fry pre-cooked rice in the same oil, added enchilada sauce and cheese I cubed with the knife.   When the cheese was melted I put this mixtue on top of the tortilla shell.

The rice was too dry at this point so I added a splash more water and microwaved again.\n\n\n#Enchilada Sauce\n\n\nThis is just (3 tablespoons flour/fat) a roux that you add a can tomato sauce to, a cup of beef broth, and a lot of chilli pepper to taste, and reduce until the desired consistency.

{"title": "Which Grain Mill For Flour?", "selftext": "My girlfriend and I brew whole grain beer and we decided it was time to utilize all this spent grain we had! So we purchased the KitchenAid grain mill attachment for our KitchenAid mixer. It's a beautiful attachment, solidly built and looks ready to mill anything.\n\nUsing it for two days, I can safely say that it is not what we thought it would be. The grain is completely dry (we baked it in the oven for a whole day), but I am finding that it is just gumming up in the grinder and fear for the mixer motor since it turns and turns and barely anything comes out! We adjusted all the settings and did a larger grind with limited success, it would either pass through un-milled or not at all. I also think that the grain itself is too light and airy (compared to wheat berries). Anyone know of any other options? Our food processor doesn't get it fine enough and we don't want to run it through our coffee grinder. Anyone experience anything similar? Have any suggestions of what we could do? We usually just cut the whole grains in with regular flour but we were wanting a finer texture. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: Dry spent grains not grinding and gumming up KitchenAid Grain Mill attachment, other alternatives and/or mill's I should look into to make it into flour?\n\nUPDATE: We ended up hitting Bob's Red Mill up here in Portland and getting some real wheat berries and spelt berries and when we were milling them we'd cut it with a little (now very dry) spent grain and it would give it enough weight to grind it through. Made some awesome pretzels the other day with it.

{"title": "I made Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen entirely from the ground up... (recipe included)", "selftext": "I'm lucky enough to live in the same city as arguably one of the best ramen chefs in the western world - Mike Satinover aka the \"Ramen\\_Lord\"  author of the \"[Book of Ramen](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLPoLxek3WLQJDtU6i3300_0nNioqeYXi7vESrtNvjQ/edit?usp=sharing).\". Mike was nice enough to take a couple of my calls and let me pick his brain about the soup, noodles, toppings, and everything in between.\n\nRamen from scratch is no simple feat. It takes time, waiting and some know-how... but don't worry the last part comes with trial and error (I didn't know JACK before I started toying with the soup/noodle techniques.) What lays before you is my interpretation of a shoyu ramen. I did my best to make it easier for the home cook - using common kitchen measurements (cups, tbsp, tsp, etc.) when possible and distilling down some complicated techniques into simple step processes. Big shoutout to Ramen\\_Lord and Way of Ramen for all the dope free information you guys provide to the masses, you two are doing the Ramen Gods work (go peep them on Instagram and YouTube.)\n\n*Almost all ramen includes 5 components*. Below you'll find the recipe organized into categories - *the noodles, soup, tare (flavor base), aromatic oil, and additional toppings*. I hope this recipe inspires you to learn more about ramen, or at the very least builds more confidence in the kitchen. Let me know if you have any questions below and COOK AWN! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc Adam\n\nNoodles: \"Easy Ramen Noodles\"\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 500g Bread Flour\n* 200g Water\n* 2g Sodium Carbonate\n* 5g Salt\n\n\\*This recipe requires a pasta machine. I use [this model](https://amzn.to/3kifsHK).\n\n\\*\\* Like most dough/bread recipes, this requires precision. I find that a [kitchen scale](https://amzn.to/3wyntgt) it necessary here to achieve consistent results.\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Stir salt and sodium carbonate into water until dissolved.\n2. Add the flour to a large bowl and incrementally, slowly pour the salted water over the flour while mixing. The mix should resemble a shaggy, crumbly mess that holds together when squeezed but falls apart when lightly massaged again. Add the dough to a ziplock bag and rest for 30 minutes.\n3. Put the ziplock bag filled with dough in another larger bag and step on the dough to create a flat sheet of dough about half an inch thick. Let the dough rest for 30 more minutes.\n4. Remove the dough from the bag, I use scissors to cut the bag as to not break the dough sheet, but I'm clumsy so you might not have to. Roll the dough sheet out until it\u2019s about 1/4 inch thick then slice it in half so it can be fed and rolled through the pasta machine.\n5. Feed one dough sheet through the \u201c0\u201d setting on the pasta machine a couple times, then fold it in half and feed it through the \u201c2\u201d setting open-end-side first. This lamination step will help align the gluten in one direction through the entire noodles which helps with texture and makes the eating experience more pleasurable.\n6. Roll the dough out one number at a time until you reach the \u201c5\u201d or \"6\" setting; 5 for thicker noodles, 6 for thinner. Once the dough is rolled out it will be long so cut the sheets into two sections. Attach the noodle cutter then feed in one sheet using your hand to keep the dough sheet flat and avoid any kinking. You may need to periodically hit the noodle sheets with a light dusting of corn or potato starch, but I've found it isn't always necessary with this dough.\n7. Lightly massage a bit of corn or potato starch into the finished noodles, portion out (100g portions), and store in a lightly starch-dusted lidded container in the fridge for 1 day before using. They'll last a couple days in the fridge, or up to 6 months in the freezer if wrapped tightly.\n8. Cook the noodles in boiling water for 2 minutes before immediately transferring to a bowl of piping hot ramen broth (see broth recipe below).\n\n\\* Optionally, dust the noodle portions in corn or potato starch and squeeze them in your hand to make wavy noodles.\n\n\\* Homemade Sodium Carbonate: Bake 100g Baking Soda on foiled baking sheet and bake at 250F for 1 hour. You\u2019ll lose about 1/3 the weight of your baking soda . Sodium carbonate gives the noodles a chewy, stretchy profile which is critical for making proper ramen noodles - don't skip it.\n\nSoup: \"Tonkotsu Soup\" by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4.5 lb Pork Neck Bones\n* 4.5 lb Pork Femur Bones or Ham Hocks\n* 25 Cups Water\n* 1 Onion, halved\n* 10 Garlic Cloves, peeled\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting broth is whiter in appearance).\n2. When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. The scum goes through several phases here, you\u2019ll know when the scum is pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white broth, don\u2019t skip it, and don\u2019t end it prematurely.\n3. Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid\\*.\\*\n4. Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices.\u00a0\n5. Add the now clean bones to a pot and add 6 L of water.\n6. Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.\n7. In the last hour, add aromatics to the broth and bump the heat up to medium-high.\n8. Strain the soup.\n9. To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won\u2019t be as strong.\u00a0\n10. Reserve the soup as needed.\n\nTare: \"Standard Shoyu Tare\" adapted from Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups Soy Sauce\n* 2 (4x3 inch) strips Kombu\n* 1/4 cup Mirin\n* 1/4 cup Sake\n* 7-8 medium Dried Anchovies (\"Niboshi\")\n* 2 cups Katsuobushi, loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, kombu, dried anchovies and sake in container then place in the fridge and let sit overnight.\n2. The next day, heat the mixture just until it\u2019s about to simmer. The tare should be steaming but not bubbling. Hold it at this stage for 10 minutes.\n3. Remove the kombu. Whisk in the brown sugar until it\u2019s dissolved then add the katsuabushi. Hold at just under a simmer for 10 more minutes.\n4. Strain the tare, store in the fridge as needed. It will last for 6 months in a covered container.\n\nAromatic Oil: Scallion \"Negi\" Oil by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* One bunch scallion whites, trimmed to their ends\n* 1/2 cup Neutral Oil\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Add oil and scallions to a small saucepan.\n2. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 10-15 minutes or until the scallions cook to a golden brown.\n3. Remove from the heat, strain the oil into a heat-proof container and store until needed.\n\n\\* The crispy scallions also make a topping for a sandwich or eggs.\n\nAdditional Toppings: Soy Egg, Chashu Pork, Menma, Scallions\n\n**Chashu Pork Ingredients:**\n\n* Pork Shoulder or Pork Belly, tied if needed\n* 1/2 cup Shoyu\n* 1/2 cup Water\n* 1 cup Sake\n* 1 cup Mirin\n* 1/2 Tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 onion, halved\n* 4 garlic cloves, smashed\n* 3 inch knob ginger, sliced\n* 1 tsp salt\n* Pepper TT\n\nChashu Pork Technique:\n\n1. Add all ingredients to a large heavy bottomed bot with a lid. Braise on 300F (149c) for 2-3 hours, or until the pork is easily pierced with a fork.\n2. Let the pork cool in the cooking liquid overnight.\n3. The next day remove the pork from the pot and slice into portions. Optionally, broil the pork or torch it for color.\n\n**Marinated Egg Ingredients:**\n\n* 1/3 cup Water\n* 1/3 cup Mirin\n* 1/3 cup Soy Sauce\n\n**Marinated Egg Technique:**\n\n1. Mix all ingredients in a cup, add eggs. Let marinade for 6-8 hours, then remove from brine and store in covered container. Leaving the eggs in the brine too long makes them VERY salty, so be aware of that.\n\n**Scallions, sliced thin**\n\n* Grab a bunch of scallions, slice them as thin as you can, reserve for serving.\n\n**Menma**\n\n* This is marinated, fermented bamboo shoot. I buy these from my asian market, but you can order them online [here](https://amzn.to/3D3ZgB8).\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Remove toppings from the fridge to temper so they aren't cold, (soy eggs, menma, chashu, etc.)\n2. Bring the soup to a simmer and begin boiling water for the noodles to cook.\n3. When the noodle cooking water is boiling, drop the noodles.\n4. While the noodles cook add the tare, aroma oil and hot broth to a warm serving bowl.\n5. Shake excess water off the noodles then transfer them to the serving bowl. Adjust noodles with chopsticks if you want.\n6. Add additional toppings and TAKE A RIDE TO MUNCHVILLE!\n\nExample Workflow:\n\nDay 0: Soak pork bones in large non-reactive container. Plastic or glass is best. This removes some impurities and blood found in the bones.\n\nDay 1: Start stock - clean bones/skim scum, start soaking tare, make scallion oil, make noodles.\n\nDay 2: Finish stock - add aromatics, strain and emulsify, simmer tare - add katsuabushi/sugar, braise/cool chashu, boil eggs.\n\nDay 3: prepare for serving (see instructions below).\n\n**P.S.

{"title": "Need help working on Rillette de Canard", "selftext": "Hiya FromScratchers, I'm going to make a flockload of Rillettes de Canard this month but so far I haven't perfected the ultimate recipe. \n\n Here's what I've got so far:\n\n* Make Confit of duck using just legs of duck and goosefat\n* once cooled enough to handle separate the meat from the bones and skin\n* bones and skin go in a pot with a light chicken stock, sauteed onion and carrot, a couple cloves of garlic, cardemom, a tiny chili pepper, bay leaves, sweet soy sauce (Kecap manis) and a peaty whiskey. Set to simmer down to a jus (de Canard), at this point I play with the salt and pepper to get the flavoring right\n* Meat gets pulled and put in a pan with the jus added, on low heat, so that plenty of the liquid in the jus is vaporised and all the flavors get absorbed into the pulled duck\n* Once there is next to no liquid forming if you lightly press a fork onto the meat take off heat, put into jars, add a tiny amount of goosefat from the confit, stir, and the coat the top with goosefat so that it will form a protective layer when cooled.\n\nMy philosophy is that less is more, but a tiny amount of flavoring really brings out the bright duck flavors while muting any gameyness. Using whiskey instead of wine will take away some sourness while adding some woodsy earthyness which I feel compliments the duck well. The sweet soy, carrot and onions give a slight sweetness that just warms up the entire taste.\n\nIs there a dark horse I left out like star anise that really puts the REEE in Rillette, or did I already overdo it, as I am wont to?\n\nLastly: I've seen several recipes throw out the bones and skin and the juices without making it into a jus. This seems like throwing away the very soul of the dish or am I missing something here? Also, I'd love to make this using entire ducks to lower my cost but I have found it extremely difficult to get a hold of duck for less than the price of just the legs (about 8 euros per kilo in NL, Europe). Best I could find was chinese duck for 6/kg and I am unsure what that type of duck will do for the flavor profile.\n\nAny suggestions to help me find reasonably priced ducks/that one extra or missing ingredient?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/97brbw/need_help_working_on_rillette_de_canard/", "created_utc": 1534277764.0, "score": 11, "author": "rankurai", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/97brbw/need_help_working_on_rillette_de_canard/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Tutorial on How to Cut some Basic Vegetables for Easier Scratch cooking", "selftext": "Hi r/fromscratch. I made a tutorial on how to cut some basic vegetables. Nothing fancy, just some fundamental knife skills. Figured you all might want to see it too.\n\n[Check it out here if interested.](https://youtu.be/NOO77T5omu0)\n\n**Tomatoes**\n\n* Lay the tomato stem side down\n* Make Slices down and as close to the bottom as possible without cutting through it\n* Rotate the tomato 90 degrees and repeat step 2\n* Lay the tomato on it's side such that the stem is facing the wall\n* Cut downward to dice the tomato up\n* Once you get to the end, it should only be a slice of tomato left. Cut it into chucks as desired\n\n**Cucumbers**\n\n* Slice  \n\n   * Lay the cucumber down and slice downward, make sure\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Angle either the knife or the cucumber at 45 degrees and slice downward. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Half Moon  \n\n   * Split the cucumber along its length, then slice normally. This is good for when you want to slices to be smaller to match other ingredients in the dish\n* Diagonal Half Moon  \n\n   * Same as the regular half moon, just angle the knife or the cucumber\n* Quarters  \n\n   * Split the cumber in half lengthwise like for the half moon, then lengthwise again to quarter it\n   * Slice as normal\n* Deseed  \n\n   * Slice lengthwise just like you do for the quarters\n   * Lay the cucumber spears with the seeds facing up\n   * Lay the knife parallel to the ground and slice across the cucumber, cutting out the seed pods\n* Julienne/matchsticks  \n\n   * Deseeded  \n\n      * Lay the deseeded cucumber spears with the deseeded side down, this is because it's a flatter and more stable surface - making it safer\n      * Slice into matchsticks\n   * Regular  \n\n      * Cut the cucumber into long cylinders\n      * Lay the cylinder on the cut side up so it's a tube sticking straight up, then slice downward into planks\n      * Stack the planks on top of each other and slice into matchsticks\n\n**Celery**\n\n* Cube/Chunk  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Cut into chunks of desired size  \n\n      * If you want, you can cut the celery in half lengthwise, then make the cuts for a smaller dice\n      * These cuts are good for mirepoix, sofrito, Louisiana Holy Trinity, and other veggie bases\n* Slice  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Angle the knife or the celery at 45 degrees and cut. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Julienne  \n\n   * Divide the celery into halves, thirds, or quarters depending on desired matchstick length\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on.\n   * Turn the celery so that it's length runs parallel to the wall/perpendicular to you\n   * Slice celery into desired julienne/matchstick length\n\n**Peppers**\n\n* Julienne/Matchstick  \n\n   * Top and tail the pepper - ie cut off the top and bottom\n   * Lay the pepper upright and make a downward cut to open up the pepper\n   * Lay it on its side and unroll the pepper\n   * Cut out the seed pod and remove any wayward seeds\n   * Slice the rolled out pepper into julienne/matchsticks sizes as desired\n* Dice  \n\n   * Line up the julienne/matchsticks and cut into desired dice size\n\n**Cabbage**\n\n* Slices/strips  \n\n   * Cut the cabbage into quarters as it's large size is unwieldy\n   * Make a V-Cut to remove the core. It's thicker than the leaves and thus cooks differently\n   * Lay the Cabbage so that the exposed core is facing the opposite wall\n   * Slice the cabbage into strips. BE CAREFUL as you get closer to the base as it's less stable there. So slower is better there\n\n**Carrots**\n\n* Roll Cut  \n\n   * This is a special cut because it makes a unique shape AND you can tailor the size of the cut pieces to match each other and thus get even cooking\n   * Cut a chunk out at a 45 degree angle.\n   * Rotate the carrot 180 degrees and make another 45 degree angle cut\n   * Repeat these cuts, but change the length of the cut so that each piece has roughly the same thickness\n* Slice  \n\n   * Cut a THIN sliver down the length of the carrot and lay the carrot on this new cut side down. This alleviates the round shape of the carrot and makes a stable and safer base to cut on\n   * Slice as desired\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Repeat the thin sliver cut above\n   * Cut at desired angle\n* Dice  \n\n   * Cut the carrot into sections (halves, thirds, etc) then cut those sections into planks of equal size\n   * Stack up the planks and cut into spears of the same thickness\n   * Line up the spear are cut into dice of desired size\n* Long Julienne  \n\n   * Cut the carrot into planks as detailed above\n   * Stack planks and cut into juliennes of desired length and width\n* Short Julienne  \n\n   * Make the Diagonal slices detailed above, but on a HEAVY bias\n   * Stack up the slices and cut into matchsticks\n\nLet me know if there are other vegetables you want to know how to cut!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/ocfvek/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables_for/", "created_utc": 1625249768.0, "score": 10, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/ocfvek/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The Muesli i'm using is \"Bob's Red Mill Brand - Old Country Style Muesli\", which contains dried Dates, and I would like to expound upon that exotic/tropical fruit flavor with a couple of the other listed ingredients.

{"title": "The sour cherry pie that science made", "selftext": "I made a sour cherry pie on Monday, and it may be the finest pie I have ever made, in my 30 years or so of pie making. Omg, it turned out so well!\n\nThis is the pie that science made, for sure. Tapioca starch is the best thickener for fruit pies, especially acidic fruits. But there is a very specific ratio of starch + sugar + water from the fruit that is then cooked to a specific temperature in order to achieve gelatinization. The resulting fruit has the perfect set, your pie slices hold together exactly so, but when you bite into it, you just get fruit, perfectly cooked. No starchy flavor, no gummy texture, just fruit, seemingly magically held together. Thanks, science!\n\nIn order to achieve those temps, this pie is baked for about an hour and fifteen minutes at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), which is quite a long time for pie. The pastry gets browned sometime around 45 minutes for the crust to an hour for the lattice. This is where pie shields or foil come in handy. You just cover the top strategically to prevent further browning.\n\nI also use science for the pastry. I used to use a classic French method that yielded incredible, flaky dough\u2026 sometimes. I got so frustrated with the inconsistency, I stopped making pastry altogether, for years. Then I came back to it as if I knew nothing, followed the science, tried several methods, and ultimately landed on adding alcohol to the pastry in order to inhibit gluten production. This makes for a flaky crust every time. And when made in a food processor and then rested in the fridge, the resulting dough is workable enough to be used for all kinds of sweet and savory pies, including weaving lattice crusts, etc, for hand pies, for blind baked pie shells (where this recipe really gets a chance to show off), it is a one size fits all dough, which is what I needed.\n\nFood is one of my special interests.

{"title": "Baja-style Fish Tacos: Recipe and History", "selftext": "Southern California is next in my quest to cook the signature dish of every American state. Thought this dish is surely Mexican, it has become Americanized in some aspects (depending where you go, of course) and is a top-seller on many Mexican-American menus.\n\nLegend has it Japanese sailors traveling to the Baja peninsula taught locals how to fry the fish with a tempura-like batter (something they learned from the Portuguese years prior). Not before long the crispy fried fish took on some Mexican flare from the locals and fish tacos quickly became a common on-the-go meal for fisherman and market workers. It wasn't until sometime in the 1980s did a San Diego based Mexican-American restauranteur popularize the taco by putting it on his menu. \n\nThe fish taco truly is a story of the intimate cultural connection between Mexico and the United States. If we take it a step further, perhaps a story of mid 20th century globalization between East and West (being Japan and Mexico). The rest is history.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for all the components of a classic SoCal, Baja-style fish taco. From Pico to Crema, it's all there. Let me know if you have any questions. Let me know if you'd like a link to the recipe video and I can shoot it over to you. I hope you like it!  \n\n\n**Fish Batter:**\n\n*This batter is inspired by The Fat Duck outside of London. The water in the alcohol evaporates quickly leaving us with a super wispy, crispy and light coating.*\n\n* 1 1/2 cup Self Rising Flour\n* 2 cups Rice Flour\n* 2 tsp Baking Powder\n* 2 Tbsp Honey\n* 1.5 cups Vodka\n* 2 cups Beer\n\n1. Mix the flour and baking soda in a large bowl. Dissolve the honey into the vodka then pour it into the flour mix. Add the beer and whisk together. Keep the batter cold in the fridge until needed.\n\n**Chili de Arbol Salsa:**\n\n*This \u201cSalsa\u201d is probably more like a hot sauce to the American palate. It\u2019s thin, vibrant red and very spicy.*\n\n* 1 Garlic clove, smashed\n* 1 cup Dried Chili de Arbol, stemmed\n* \u2153 cup Water\n* 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* Kosher Salt, to taste\n\n1. Snap the stems off of the chilies. Dry roast the chilis in a hot skillet until aromatic then add to a blender, do the same to the garlic.\n2. Blend the chilis and garlic until pulverized completely, then add the water, salt and vinegar and process again until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve over fish tacos.\n\n**Avocado Crema:**\n\n*This creamy sauce is a much needed cooling element to the taco. It\u2019s also good on sandwiches, eggs, etc.*\n\n* 2 avocados, pitted and peeled\n* 1 Garlic clove\n* \u00bd cup Mexican Crema\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt, more to taste\n* 3-4 Tbsp Lime juice, more to taste\n\n1. Blend everything in a food processor. If the crema is too thick, thin it down with more lime juice or water.\n\n**Pico de Gallo:**\n\n*This is everyone's favorite mild, refreshing salsa and it couldn\u2019t be easier to make.*\n\n* 3 tomato, diced and seeded\n* 1 white onion, diced\n* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped\n* 1-2 Jalapenos, finely chopped\n* 2 Tbsp Lime Juice, more to taste\n* Kosher salt, to taste\n\n**To Build the Tacos\u2026**\n\n1. Double up the tortillas, lay in the fish followed by a drizzle of the arbol salsa, the slaw, the pico and the avocado crema. Serve with a cold, crisp cerveza and crush!\n\n**P.S.** Any white saltwater fish works great for fish tacos.

{"title": "Chimichangas from Arizona (Deep Fried Burritos)", "selftext": "Legend has it, the famous Arizonan Chimichanga was accidentally discovered by a Mexican-American mother. One day, in a rush to get food on the table to feed her small family, the woman added too much oil to the pan before frying her pre-rolled burritos. The burritos were deep-fried instead of shallow fried leaving her a crispy, crunchy, fully fried end result that would later be coined the \"chimichanga.\"\n\nIt may be a legend, sure. I mean there's no real historical proof that the discovery of the dish went down that way. Regardless of fact, it's a fun story that describes an awesome treat-of-a-dish. I started doing some research into the definition of American food by creating a video series on YouTube called \"Cooking the States.\" As you might imagine (and probably already know) the Southwestern states are HUGELY influenced by our neighbors down south; Mexico and the American Southwest have intimate cultural ties and food is no exception.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for Chimichangas aka Deep Fried Burritos. I made everything from scratch including the flour tortillas which, if you haven't tried homemade flour tortillas are well worth the time - they're supremely chewy and flavorful. The filling is just shredded beef and cheese while the other \"fillings\" that you might expect in a burrito are more like \"toppings.\" Anyways, I'll leave my recipe below and, if you want to cook-along, a video to go along with it. Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjAWxIXHbVg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam). Cheers!\n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n* 3-4 pound Beef Chuck Roast\n* 3 dried Guajillo Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Ancho Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Chipotle Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 4 Garlic Cloves\n* 4 cups Beef Stock\n* 1/2 cup Tomato Puree\n* 1 tsp ground Allspice\n* 1 tsp dried Oregano\n* 3 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar\n* 2 tsp Kosher Salt\n* 1 stick of Cinnamon\n* 3 Bay Leaves\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n* 680g All-purpose Flour\n* 100g Lard\n* 7g Kosher Salt\n* 360g Water, warm (about 90F)\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n* Flour Tortillas (from recipe)\n* Beef Barbacoa (from recipe)\n* 8 ounces Colby Cheese, cut into batons\n* 8 ounces Monterey Jack Cheese, cut into batons\n* Neutral Oil for frying\n\n**To serve...**\n\n* Romaine Lettuce, shredded\n* Black olives, sliced thin\n* Tomato, seeded and diced\n* Avocado, sliced thin\n* Mexican Crema\n* Lime Wedges\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 250F.\n2. Bring the stock up to a boil then turn off the heat, and pour the stock into a blender. Add the torn chiles and garlic then cover. Let the mixture steep for 15-20 minutes, or until the chiles have softened.\n3. Add the red wine vinegar, dried oregano, cinnamon, allspice and tomato puree. Blitz into a thin puree. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or vinegar if need be.\n4. In a large dutch oven over high heat, sear the beef chuck until richly brown and caramelized then pour over the chili braising liquid from the blender. Add the cinnamon stick and bay leaves then braise the beef.\n5. If using a regular pot or dutch oven braise with the lid on, for 2-3 hours, or until you can easily shred the meat with a fork. If using a pressure cooker, cover the braise and place over a burner over high heat. Allow the braise to rise up to full pressure, then lower the heat to medium and hold the braise at high pressure for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cut the heat and carefully release the pressure with a wooden spoon.\n6. Remove the beef from the pot and let cool slightly. Take the beef out of the braising liquid and shred it with a fork then set it aside. Optionally do this step ahead and let the beef rest in the braising liquid overnight for more flavor, but make sure the beef is drained before folding burritos.\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n1. In a large bowl, work the fat into the flour with your fingers until incorporated like pie dough. Make a well in the center of the bowl. Dissolve salt into the water then pour it into the well and work it into the flour by hand. Work the dough until it comes together, then dump it onto the counter and knead until smooth.\n2. Divide the dough into 6 portions, set them covered on a plate and let rest for 30 minutes.\n3. With flour as needed, roll out the little balls to 14 inches with a rolling pin. Heat a large, wide, ungreased pan or tray over medium heat and cook the tortillas for 20-30 seconds, flip and repeat on the other side. Don\u2019t overcook the tortillas or they\u2019ll become crispy.\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n1. Lay a flour tortilla on a clean work surface and spoon in some beef strained barbacoa followed by a piece of Colby and Monterey cheese, top with more beef. Wrap the burrito tightly into a flat rectangular shape similar to a pizza pocket, secure with wooden toothpicks, then set it on a baking sheet while you roll the remaining burritos.\n2. Bring the oil to 375F and fry the burritos, two-three at a time, until crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oil, let rest while you fry the remaining burritos and fry a second time for an extra crispy Chimichanga. Drain the finished burritos on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n3. Serve with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, black olives and a zigzag of fresh Mexican crema.

{"title": "I recreated a Banh Mi from my favorite Vietnamese bakery in Chicago.", "selftext": "Colonization is not tight, however in the case of Vietnam, a food-history-curious guy, such as myself, cannot overlook the cross-cultural delicacies French occupation brought to the country. Without the co-mingling of the Vietnamese and French people, we likely wouldn\u2019t have pho or banh mi. Crazy.\n\nThere's the delicate crunch and ultimate fluffiness from the Vietnamese baguette (much different than the French variety), a super flavorful main filling (in our case gorgeous Lemongrass chicken), crunchy aromatic vegetables and tangy, semi-sweet pickles AND NOT TO MENTION the rich, depth from a well-made pate.\n\nAll of the ingredients and technique are listed below. I also posted a how-to video if you prefer visuals. Let me know if you have any questions!\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Ingredients:\n\n500g Bread Flour\n\n5g Instant Yeast\n\n4g Sugar\n\n8g Kosher Salt\n\n345g Cold Water\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Technique:\n\n1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the bread flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt until homogenized. Pour in the cold water and mix with the paddle attachment for 1 minute. Replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook and knead for 10-20 minutes, until the dough passes the stretch test.\n2. Remove the dough from the mixer, shape it into a ball. Plop the dough into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest until doubled in size for 30 minutes to an hour.\n3. Grease your hands, then dump the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly greased work surface. Shape the dough into a large, 1 inch thick puck. Cut the dough like a pizza into 4 equal wedge-shaped triangular pieces like a pizza (280g each).\n4. Flatten the dough by hand, then roll from the top point down to the base of the triangle. Roll and press the dough down by the ends making sure to keep the middle fatter than the ends. Pinch the ends to seal, then continue rolling until smooth.\n5. Transfer the shaped baguettes to a baking tray lined with parchment, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes to an hour until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 500F, make sure it\u2019s preheated for at least 30 minutes before baking.\n6. Spray the baguettes with water, then make a long, deep slash running the length of the baguette. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. At the 12 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water, then close the oven. At the 9 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water again, rotate the baking sheets, then close the oven. At the 6 minute mark, spray again, then finally with 3 minutes remaining spray a final time. You will have baked a total of 15 minutes, and sprayed the baguettes 5 times. Be liberal with the water.\n7. Remove the baguettes from the oven and let cool completely on the baking sheets. The resulting loaf should be light, crispy, moist and cottony on the inside.\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Ingredients:\n\n1/2 pound Chicken Liver\n\n1/2 Yellow Onion, sliced thin\n\n1 Garlic clove, peeled and smashed\n\n1 tsp Chinese 5-Spice Powder\n\n1/2 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n1/2 cup Water\n\n1 1/2 sticks Unsalted Butter, room temperature and cut into 1/2 inch cubes.\n\n2 tsp Shaoxing Cooking Wine\n\nGround Black Pepper TT\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Technique:\n\n1. Add the chicken livers, onion, garlic, salt and water to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the chicken livers are barely pink on the inside, 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool with the cover on for 5-10 minutes.\n2. Strain the mixture and add the chicken livers, onion and garlic to a food processor. Process the ingredients until pureed. Add the wine, 5 spice and a few cracks of black pepper and pur\u00e9e until smooth again. With the machine running, add the tempered butter one cube at a time until emulsified into the liver mixture.\n3. Transfer to ramekins or a sealable container and refrigerate until solid. Serve chilled and spread on Vietnamese baguettes.\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickles Ingredients:\n\n1 1/2 cups White Vinegar\n\n1 cup water\n\n1 tsp Salt\n\n1/2 cup Sugar\n\n1 pound Carrot, Ribbons\n\n1 pound Diakon, julienned\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickle Technique:\n\n1. Add the vinegar and water to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and salt until dissolved. Remove from heat and pour over the carrot and daikon. Store covered in the fridge for 1-2 weeks.\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Ingredients:\n\n1 pound Boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\n1 stalk lemongrass, peeled and chopped fine\n\n2 Garlic cloves, minced\n\n2 Tbsp Lime Juice\n\n2 Tbsp Fish sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Dark Brown Sugar\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Technique:\n\n1. Combine all the ingredients in a bag and let marinate in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n2. Remove chicken from the bag, pat dry, shake off veg chunks and sear in a pan with some oil on both sides. Add a dash of the marinade to the pan, cover and cook on the stovetop until finished.\n3. Let cool slightly, chop up into pieces, set aside for sandwich.\n\n## To build the final sandwich:\n\n1. Hollow out baguette, spread thin pate on top of baguette, then pile in some lemongrass chicken.\n2. Top with cucumber, daikon and carrot pickles, jalapeno and cilantro. Close sandwich and munch as is or cut it in half.\n\n## Example Workflow:\n\n1. Make bread, let rest 30 minutes to an hour or until doubled in size.\n2. While the bread rises, make marinade and let chicken marinate for at least an hour. Make chicken liver pate, let chill and solidify in fridge. Cut all vegetables (cucumber, jals, carrots, daikon), make pickling liquid for quick pickles and submerge carrots and daikon.\n3. Shape baguettes, let rest another 30 minutes to an hour on tray, or until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30 minutes.\n4. While the shaped bread proofs and the oven preheats, cook the marinated chicken, chop into pieces and set aside.\n5. Bake baguettes, remove from oven and let rest for 20 minutes before opening. Ready all other prepped ingredients to build the sandwich.\n6. Build sandwich. Remove chunk of insides of dough, add lemongrass chicken, cucumber, pickles, jals and cilantro. Spread pate on top, then close the sandwich. Optionally cut in half and MUNCH HARD.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The baguette recipe makes enough for 4 medium (or 2 large) baguettes.\n* As usual, I\u2019ve provided grams for the bread component of the sandwich for accuracy.\n* French Baguettes and Vietnamese baguettes are different.\n* Chinese 5-spice powder consists of star anise, fennel, Szechuan peppercorns, cinnamon and cloves. If you\u2019d like, you can make your own blend, but the mixture is widely available in many American grocery stores.\n* \u201cBread Improver\u201d is a chemical dough relaxant that allows bread to stay malleable without having to rest it as long or at all. I spoke with a few professional bakers who said that Bread Improver is not necessary and only helpful when baking on a commercial scale. I did a side by side comparison and I couldn\u2019t tell a difference in taste with or without the improver so\u2026 leave it out. There\u2019s no reason to worry about it here.\n\n**Watch the video here -** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ\\_oIh4AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ_oIh4AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "created_utc": 1646841276.0, "score": 102, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "pizza crust - I keep messing it up", "selftext": "apologies in advance if this is asked a million times.  just point me to that post and will read intently.\n\nSo here's the scoop - I have been attempting my own pizza crust for a while (think years).  I'd gotten it to about a \"meh, it tastes like pizza crust\" level, using bread flour.   If I do it on the weber grill it goes a little better, but still.. just ok.  So I got a \"kit\" at one point as a gift from Williams Sonoma   (pizza crust+ sauce),  did THAT on the weber and it was just freaking great.  As good a crust as I've ever had.  So I've gone down a hole trying to make a better pizza crust, and its just not working.  I can't get beyond 'meh'.\n\nI've tried '00' flour,  more expensive bread flour.  I've used a food processor, I've mixed by hand.  I've used purely metric measurements from youtube videos made by italians (as opposed to imperial or whatever we americans call what do our measuring with) .  If anything I just end up making it worse.    What is the magic I'm missing?\n\nHere's the process at this point:\n\nusing various flours (again either \"00\", bread etc.  I'm not mixing the flours together, just using different types).   Here's the basic recipe\n\n600ml water\n\n1kg  flour (edited)\n\n30g salt\n\n2g yeast\n\nI mix with my hands and end up kneading no more than 12 minutes (I timed it) .  The dough seems like it should be.  its in a ball and I press a dimple in it and it springs up.  I've even checked the temperature of the center of the big dough ball.\n\nlet the dough rest for about 2 hours,  make my dough balls, put a little olive oil around each one, put them in tupperware, and leave them alone for a day.\n\nI then take one, and roll it out  (I try to do the various hand methods but I and up with at least one super thin area, and or holes).   I get it to about 3/16 of an inch thick (4-5 mm).  meanwhile put my pizza stone in the oven (its on the cheapy side, but its well seasoned at this point), pre heat the oven on 420 (no there is no significance there.  honestly).  when the preheated beep goes off, I pull out the pizza stone, throw the dough on it,  quickly put sauce, cheese and toppings on, and into the oven for about 12 minutes.\n\nwhat I get is a very chewy crust. at 12 minutes,  it was also crunchy, and not in an appetizing way (too hard crunchy)  if I vary the length of time lower, still very chewy.\n\nI used to put olive oil on the stone and spread it around before I put the crust on it.  but haven't done that in a while.\n\nSo I'm screwing things up,  and I don't know where i'm going wrong to fix it.   help please.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/smcqsr/pizza_crust_i_keep_messing_it_up/", "created_utc": 1644194997.0, "score": 39, "author": "SoImaRedditUserNow", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/smcqsr/pizza_crust_i_keep_messing_it_up/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

My method is to clean the jars, the whole cooking area and wipe everything down with lysol wipes except for the jars, those I rinse with a little vinegar. I'll take my clean veggies and chop them up, stuffing then into the jar. I then mix my brine and bring it to a boil and put it over the veggies, filling the jar.

{"title": "I made Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen entirely from the ground up... (recipe included)", "selftext": "I'm lucky enough to live in the same city as arguably one of the best ramen chefs in the western world - Mike Satinover aka the \"Ramen\\_Lord\"  author of the \"[Book of Ramen](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLPoLxek3WLQJDtU6i3300_0nNioqeYXi7vESrtNvjQ/edit?usp=sharing).\". Mike was nice enough to take a couple of my calls and let me pick his brain about the soup, noodles, toppings, and everything in between.\n\nRamen from scratch is no simple feat. It takes time, waiting and some know-how... but don't worry the last part comes with trial and error (I didn't know JACK before I started toying with the soup/noodle techniques.) What lays before you is my interpretation of a shoyu ramen. I did my best to make it easier for the home cook - using common kitchen measurements (cups, tbsp, tsp, etc.) when possible and distilling down some complicated techniques into simple step processes. Big shoutout to Ramen\\_Lord and Way of Ramen for all the dope free information you guys provide to the masses, you two are doing the Ramen Gods work (go peep them on Instagram and YouTube.)\n\n*Almost all ramen includes 5 components*. Below you'll find the recipe organized into categories - *the noodles, soup, tare (flavor base), aromatic oil, and additional toppings*. I hope this recipe inspires you to learn more about ramen, or at the very least builds more confidence in the kitchen. Let me know if you have any questions below and COOK AWN! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc Adam\n\nNoodles: \"Easy Ramen Noodles\"\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 500g Bread Flour\n* 200g Water\n* 2g Sodium Carbonate\n* 5g Salt\n\n\\*This recipe requires a pasta machine. I use [this model](https://amzn.to/3kifsHK).\n\n\\*\\* Like most dough/bread recipes, this requires precision. I find that a [kitchen scale](https://amzn.to/3wyntgt) it necessary here to achieve consistent results.\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Stir salt and sodium carbonate into water until dissolved.\n2. Add the flour to a large bowl and incrementally, slowly pour the salted water over the flour while mixing. The mix should resemble a shaggy, crumbly mess that holds together when squeezed but falls apart when lightly massaged again. Add the dough to a ziplock bag and rest for 30 minutes.\n3. Put the ziplock bag filled with dough in another larger bag and step on the dough to create a flat sheet of dough about half an inch thick. Let the dough rest for 30 more minutes.\n4. Remove the dough from the bag, I use scissors to cut the bag as to not break the dough sheet, but I'm clumsy so you might not have to. Roll the dough sheet out until it\u2019s about 1/4 inch thick then slice it in half so it can be fed and rolled through the pasta machine.\n5. Feed one dough sheet through the \u201c0\u201d setting on the pasta machine a couple times, then fold it in half and feed it through the \u201c2\u201d setting open-end-side first. This lamination step will help align the gluten in one direction through the entire noodles which helps with texture and makes the eating experience more pleasurable.\n6. Roll the dough out one number at a time until you reach the \u201c5\u201d or \"6\" setting; 5 for thicker noodles, 6 for thinner. Once the dough is rolled out it will be long so cut the sheets into two sections. Attach the noodle cutter then feed in one sheet using your hand to keep the dough sheet flat and avoid any kinking. You may need to periodically hit the noodle sheets with a light dusting of corn or potato starch, but I've found it isn't always necessary with this dough.\n7. Lightly massage a bit of corn or potato starch into the finished noodles, portion out (100g portions), and store in a lightly starch-dusted lidded container in the fridge for 1 day before using. They'll last a couple days in the fridge, or up to 6 months in the freezer if wrapped tightly.\n8. Cook the noodles in boiling water for 2 minutes before immediately transferring to a bowl of piping hot ramen broth (see broth recipe below).\n\n\\* Optionally, dust the noodle portions in corn or potato starch and squeeze them in your hand to make wavy noodles.\n\n\\* Homemade Sodium Carbonate: Bake 100g Baking Soda on foiled baking sheet and bake at 250F for 1 hour. You\u2019ll lose about 1/3 the weight of your baking soda . Sodium carbonate gives the noodles a chewy, stretchy profile which is critical for making proper ramen noodles - don't skip it.\n\nSoup: \"Tonkotsu Soup\" by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4.5 lb Pork Neck Bones\n* 4.5 lb Pork Femur Bones or Ham Hocks\n* 25 Cups Water\n* 1 Onion, halved\n* 10 Garlic Cloves, peeled\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting broth is whiter in appearance).\n2. When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. The scum goes through several phases here, you\u2019ll know when the scum is pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white broth, don\u2019t skip it, and don\u2019t end it prematurely.\n3. Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid\\*.\\*\n4. Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices.\u00a0\n5. Add the now clean bones to a pot and add 6 L of water.\n6. Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.\n7. In the last hour, add aromatics to the broth and bump the heat up to medium-high.\n8. Strain the soup.\n9. To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won\u2019t be as strong.\u00a0\n10. Reserve the soup as needed.\n\nTare: \"Standard Shoyu Tare\" adapted from Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups Soy Sauce\n* 2 (4x3 inch) strips Kombu\n* 1/4 cup Mirin\n* 1/4 cup Sake\n* 7-8 medium Dried Anchovies (\"Niboshi\")\n* 2 cups Katsuobushi, loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, kombu, dried anchovies and sake in container then place in the fridge and let sit overnight.\n2. The next day, heat the mixture just until it\u2019s about to simmer. The tare should be steaming but not bubbling. Hold it at this stage for 10 minutes.\n3. Remove the kombu. Whisk in the brown sugar until it\u2019s dissolved then add the katsuabushi. Hold at just under a simmer for 10 more minutes.\n4. Strain the tare, store in the fridge as needed. It will last for 6 months in a covered container.\n\nAromatic Oil: Scallion \"Negi\" Oil by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* One bunch scallion whites, trimmed to their ends\n* 1/2 cup Neutral Oil\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Add oil and scallions to a small saucepan.\n2. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 10-15 minutes or until the scallions cook to a golden brown.\n3. Remove from the heat, strain the oil into a heat-proof container and store until needed.\n\n\\* The crispy scallions also make a topping for a sandwich or eggs.\n\nAdditional Toppings: Soy Egg, Chashu Pork, Menma, Scallions\n\n**Chashu Pork Ingredients:**\n\n* Pork Shoulder or Pork Belly, tied if needed\n* 1/2 cup Shoyu\n* 1/2 cup Water\n* 1 cup Sake\n* 1 cup Mirin\n* 1/2 Tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 onion, halved\n* 4 garlic cloves, smashed\n* 3 inch knob ginger, sliced\n* 1 tsp salt\n* Pepper TT\n\nChashu Pork Technique:\n\n1. Add all ingredients to a large heavy bottomed bot with a lid. Braise on 300F (149c) for 2-3 hours, or until the pork is easily pierced with a fork.\n2. Let the pork cool in the cooking liquid overnight.\n3. The next day remove the pork from the pot and slice into portions. Optionally, broil the pork or torch it for color.\n\n**Marinated Egg Ingredients:**\n\n* 1/3 cup Water\n* 1/3 cup Mirin\n* 1/3 cup Soy Sauce\n\n**Marinated Egg Technique:**\n\n1. Mix all ingredients in a cup, add eggs. Let marinade for 6-8 hours, then remove from brine and store in covered container. Leaving the eggs in the brine too long makes them VERY salty, so be aware of that.\n\n**Scallions, sliced thin**\n\n* Grab a bunch of scallions, slice them as thin as you can, reserve for serving.\n\n**Menma**\n\n* This is marinated, fermented bamboo shoot. I buy these from my asian market, but you can order them online [here](https://amzn.to/3D3ZgB8).\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Remove toppings from the fridge to temper so they aren't cold, (soy eggs, menma, chashu, etc.)\n2. Bring the soup to a simmer and begin boiling water for the noodles to cook.\n3. When the noodle cooking water is boiling, drop the noodles.\n4. While the noodles cook add the tare, aroma oil and hot broth to a warm serving bowl.\n5. Shake excess water off the noodles then transfer them to the serving bowl. Adjust noodles with chopsticks if you want.\n6. Add additional toppings and TAKE A RIDE TO MUNCHVILLE!\n\nExample Workflow:\n\nDay 0: Soak pork bones in large non-reactive container. Plastic or glass is best. This removes some impurities and blood found in the bones.\n\nDay 1: Start stock - clean bones/skim scum, start soaking tare, make scallion oil, make noodles.\n\nDay 2: Finish stock - add aromatics, strain and emulsify, simmer tare - add katsuabushi/sugar, braise/cool chashu, boil eggs.\n\nDay 3: prepare for serving (see instructions below).\n\n**P.S.

It is woody and hard to chew\n   * Slice it into pieces of desired size, preferably the same size as the florets\n\n**Apples**\n\n* Slice  \n\n   * Lay the apple with stem facing up and cut a large plank off, stopping right where the core is\n   * Rotate the apple 180 degrees and repeat previous step\n   * With the core now exposed, slice off two smaller planks around the core\n   * Lay the planks with their cut side down and begin making slices of desired size\n* Dice  \n\n   * Larger Plank  \n\n      * Lay the large plank cut side down and slice in half horizontally, with blade parallel to the cutting board\n      * Stack the halves on top of each other and make slices perpendicular to the cutting board\n      * Rotate the sliced plank 90 degrees, keeping the whole thing together and make dices of desired size\n   * Smaller Plank  \n\n      * Lay the plank down, with the side that was touching the core on the bottom\n      * Slice in half with knife perpendicular to cutting board\n      * Lay apple on its side and slice in half again\n      * Rotate the sliced up plank 90 degrees, keeping the whole thing together and make dices of desired size\n\n**Zucchini**\n\n* Half Moon Slice  \n\n   * Top and tail the zucchini (cut off root and stem)\n   * Split the zucchini in half lengthwise\n   * Slice the zucchini into desired width\n* Oblique Half Moon  \n\n   * Repeat steps above, except angle knife or zucchini before slicing\n* Deseed  \n\n   * Slice the zucchini in half lengthwise\n   * Cut each half in half again lengthwise, quartering it\n   * Lay the zucchini with the seeds facing the ceiling\n   * With the knife parallel, slice across the seed pod, removing it\n   * Repeat for each zucchini quarter\n* Matchstick  \n\n   * Deseed the zucchini in the steps above\n   * Lay the zucchini with the length parallel to the blade\n   * Make the matchstick cuts\n* Dices  \n\n   * Quarter the zucchini like you did right before removing seed pod\n   * Grab two quarters and line them up\n   * Make dices of desired size\n\n**Eggplant**\n\n* Slice Rounds  \n\n   * Remove leaves off stem and cut stem off\n   * Skin Eggplant as the skin can be bitter and tough to chew\n   * Lay the eggplant on its side\n   * Make slices of desired size\n* Planks  \n\n   * Cut Eggplant in half along width to make it more manageable\n   * Lay the halves cut side down and slice large planks off\n* Slice Matchsticks  \n\n   * Stack up the planks and slice through them with knife perpendicular with cutting board\n* Dices  \n\n   * Line up matchsticks and make dices of desired size\n\n**Cherry Tomatoes**\n\n* Grab a handful of tomatoes\n* Grab a flat lid or something that can lay on top of all the tomatoes\n* Saw/slice through ALL the tomatoes, using the lid to hold them in place\n\n**Potatoes**\n\n* Slice Rounds  \n\n   * Cut a thin sliver off the potato\u2019s side\n   * Lay the potato down on this cut side for stability\n   * Slice rounds off of desired size\n* Plank  \n\n   * Cut the first plank off the potato\n   * Lay the potato on the cut side\n   * Slice off planks the same size as the first plank\n* Matchsticks/Fried  \n\n   * Stack up planks\n   * Cut them into matchsticks/fried of desired length\n* Dice  \n\n   * Line up matchsticks/fries\n   * Cut into dices of desired size\n\nLet me know if there's other foods you'd like tutorials on how to prep, I'd be happy to demonstrate!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/oq5u6k/another_tutorial_on_how_to_cut_up_some_basic/", "created_utc": 1627057249.0, "score": 51, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/oq5u6k/another_tutorial_on_how_to_cut_up_some_basic/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Tutorial on How to Cut some Basic Vegetables for Easier Scratch cooking", "selftext": "Hi r/fromscratch. I made a tutorial on how to cut some basic vegetables. Nothing fancy, just some fundamental knife skills. Figured you all might want to see it too.\n\n[Check it out here if interested.](https://youtu.be/NOO77T5omu0)\n\n**Tomatoes**\n\n* Lay the tomato stem side down\n* Make Slices down and as close to the bottom as possible without cutting through it\n* Rotate the tomato 90 degrees and repeat step 2\n* Lay the tomato on it's side such that the stem is facing the wall\n* Cut downward to dice the tomato up\n* Once you get to the end, it should only be a slice of tomato left. Cut it into chucks as desired\n\n**Cucumbers**\n\n* Slice  \n\n   * Lay the cucumber down and slice downward, make sure\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Angle either the knife or the cucumber at 45 degrees and slice downward. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Half Moon  \n\n   * Split the cucumber along its length, then slice normally. This is good for when you want to slices to be smaller to match other ingredients in the dish\n* Diagonal Half Moon  \n\n   * Same as the regular half moon, just angle the knife or the cucumber\n* Quarters  \n\n   * Split the cumber in half lengthwise like for the half moon, then lengthwise again to quarter it\n   * Slice as normal\n* Deseed  \n\n   * Slice lengthwise just like you do for the quarters\n   * Lay the cucumber spears with the seeds facing up\n   * Lay the knife parallel to the ground and slice across the cucumber, cutting out the seed pods\n* Julienne/matchsticks  \n\n   * Deseeded  \n\n      * Lay the deseeded cucumber spears with the deseeded side down, this is because it's a flatter and more stable surface - making it safer\n      * Slice into matchsticks\n   * Regular  \n\n      * Cut the cucumber into long cylinders\n      * Lay the cylinder on the cut side up so it's a tube sticking straight up, then slice downward into planks\n      * Stack the planks on top of each other and slice into matchsticks\n\n**Celery**\n\n* Cube/Chunk  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Cut into chunks of desired size  \n\n      * If you want, you can cut the celery in half lengthwise, then make the cuts for a smaller dice\n      * These cuts are good for mirepoix, sofrito, Louisiana Holy Trinity, and other veggie bases\n* Slice  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Angle the knife or the celery at 45 degrees and cut. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Julienne  \n\n   * Divide the celery into halves, thirds, or quarters depending on desired matchstick length\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on.\n   * Turn the celery so that it's length runs parallel to the wall/perpendicular to you\n   * Slice celery into desired julienne/matchstick length\n\n**Peppers**\n\n* Julienne/Matchstick  \n\n   * Top and tail the pepper - ie cut off the top and bottom\n   * Lay the pepper upright and make a downward cut to open up the pepper\n   * Lay it on its side and unroll the pepper\n   * Cut out the seed pod and remove any wayward seeds\n   * Slice the rolled out pepper into julienne/matchsticks sizes as desired\n* Dice  \n\n   * Line up the julienne/matchsticks and cut into desired dice size\n\n**Cabbage**\n\n* Slices/strips  \n\n   * Cut the cabbage into quarters as it's large size is unwieldy\n   * Make a V-Cut to remove the core. It's thicker than the leaves and thus cooks differently\n   * Lay the Cabbage so that the exposed core is facing the opposite wall\n   * Slice the cabbage into strips. BE CAREFUL as you get closer to the base as it's less stable there. So slower is better there\n\n**Carrots**\n\n* Roll Cut  \n\n   * This is a special cut because it makes a unique shape AND you can tailor the size of the cut pieces to match each other and thus get even cooking\n   * Cut a chunk out at a 45 degree angle.\n   * Rotate the carrot 180 degrees and make another 45 degree angle cut\n   * Repeat these cuts, but change the length of the cut so that each piece has roughly the same thickness\n* Slice  \n\n   * Cut a THIN sliver down the length of the carrot and lay the carrot on this new cut side down. This alleviates the round shape of the carrot and makes a stable and safer base to cut on\n   * Slice as desired\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Repeat the thin sliver cut above\n   * Cut at desired angle\n* Dice  \n\n   * Cut the carrot into sections (halves, thirds, etc) then cut those sections into planks of equal size\n   * Stack up the planks and cut into spears of the same thickness\n   * Line up the spear are cut into dice of desired size\n* Long Julienne  \n\n   * Cut the carrot into planks as detailed above\n   * Stack planks and cut into juliennes of desired length and width\n* Short Julienne  \n\n   * Make the Diagonal slices detailed above, but on a HEAVY bias\n   * Stack up the slices and cut into matchsticks\n\nLet me know if there are other vegetables you want to know how to cut!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/ocfvek/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables_for/", "created_utc": 1625249768.0, "score": 10, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/ocfvek/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Ketchup made from the ground up... (not too sweet)", "selftext": "Ketchup and I have a complicated relationship. While other kids slathered their hotdogs, burgers and french fries with ketchup, I much preferred hot sauce or... just plain fried I guess. I viewed ketchup as a neon red sugar paste that has no place on anything one intends to put in their mouth. That is, until my early 20s when I tried some homemade ketchup from a local burger spot that blew my mind; it was tangy, salty, and umami with just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the whole deal. Never before did I know that ketchup could... not suck. Trust me, it might sound contrary, but I'm not a food elitist, I pretty much eat anything so forgive me when I say that most store-bought ketchup is... subpar.\n\nThe recipe and technique listed below is my attempt at recreating the homemade ketchup that turned me onto ketchup. I've decided to use San Marzano tomatoes because they're high quality, widely available all over the place, and always stay \"in season.\" If using fresh tomatoes, wait until summer or the ketchup isn't going to be too good. I've also included a video to those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions in the comments!\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 (28oz) cans San Marzano tomatoes, crushed\n* 1 cup Water\n* 1 cup White Vinegar\n* \u2154 cup Sugar\n* 2 tsp salt + more TT\n* 1 tsp MSG\n* 1 tsp Worcestershire\n* 1/2 tsp onion powder\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n* 1 tsp Fish Sauce + more TT\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Technique:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 300F.\n2. Pour tomatoes, water, sugar, salt, onion powder and garlic powder into the dutch oven. Break the tomato up with a wooden spoon.\n3. Place the dutch oven in the oven for 3-4 hours, or until reduced by about 2/3 and almost dry. Sometime at the 1.5 hour mark, stir the mixture making sure to push down any toasty tomato stuck to the sides of the pot.\n4. Add all the ingredients to a blender, and puree until a smooth mixture forms. Pass the puree through a fine mesh sieve to catch any seeds. Transfer to a sealable container and cool.\n5. Once cool, adjust seasoning and add fish sauce. Fish sauce is SALTY, if the finished ketchup needs more salt, keep in mind that the fish sauce will help with that. You should add enough that you get a certain umami from the fish sauce, but cannot fully taste or smell it - if you can taste it, you\u2019ve added too much.\n\n\\* *A Note about Xanthan Gum (XG):* Xanthan Gum is a hydrocolloid meaning that it thickens, strengthens and can sometimes smooth out purees and emulsions. I chose not to add it into the ketchup in this video because it seemed like an extra step. If using, puree the ketchup, pass it through a strainer, then reintroduce the ketchup to the blender and when pureeing add a bump of XG to the mix. Not too much, only 1/8th of a tablespoon or so will get you where you need to be.\n\n\\*\\* Wait until the ketchup is cooled before seasoning with salt. Cold food needs more salt, and if you season it while still hot, you could under season the ketchup. \n\n**Umami-LOADED Ketchup From Scratch** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "created_utc": 1625061802.0, "score": 67, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Why you shouldn't Crowd your Pan, and How to Always Get Golden Brown Food", "selftext": "Hi r/fromscratch. Here's a culinary quick tip write up on how to get that golden brown (Maillard Reactions) deliciousness on your food. Super helpful for any cut of meat, especially more economical ones like chicken thighs, beef round, pork loin chops, etc. Also made a vid to show what I'm talking about.\n\n[Take a look here if interested.](https://youtu.be/6tfvAVP480w)\n\nThe whole reason we want Maillard Reactions/Browning is because of the crust/crispy like texture it provides and because it\u2019s a series of Reactions that we find more flavorful than plain grey meat. It DOES NOT lock in the juices, that is a myth. You can get a perfect golden brown sear on any meat then let it sit for a bit. After 5 minutes the surface of it will be wet from the juices inside of it. Therefore we aren\u2019t sealing in anything. It\u2019s the texture and flavor compounds that we want.\n\nIn order to get that golden brown crust on any food, it needs to reach a certain temperature. Upwards of 310F/154C. If you crowd the pan with food, then the moisture released will be much greater from that increased amount of food. This causes water to pool in the pan because it cannot evaporate out fast enough. Water in liquid form cannot get above 212F/100C, which is far below the temperature we need for the Maillard Reaction (good browning). So instead of searing, we end up boiling/steaming the meat and while it does cook this way, it will not get that Maillard Reaction browning we\u2019re aiming for.\n\nIn a non crowded pan, the water can evaporate because there\u2019s less of it and thus we can get to those high temperatures we need to good Maillard Browning.

{"title": "Your own Chicago-Style Giardiniera (Italian Pickle Condiment)", "selftext": "Giardiniera are spicy, pickled Italian vegetables. It comes in chunkier small diced form, or my personal favorite Giardiniera relish. Giardiniera is magical on pizza, sandwiches, burgers and, of course, absolutely crucial for any respectable Italian Beef sandwich.\n\nGiardiniera is a lifestyle here in Chicago and it took me until I was 12 years old to realize that it a Chicago thing. I was out of town and walked up to a server at a pizza restaurant asking for some and she looked at me crooked like a confused pooch. I was sad. But you don't have to be sad because no matter where you reside, you can make it at home. It takes a few days, but it's pretty easy and once you make a batch you'll be good for weeks, probably even months - yes, it keeps for a long time.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe, the technique and a video to go along with it all. I hope it helps. If you have any questions, let me know in the comment section here. Good luck!\n\n**Giardiniera Ingredients\u2026**\n\n*Giardiniera Veg:*\n\n* Half head of Cauliflower (260g), large dice\n* 4 Celery stalks (250g), large dice\n* 3 Carrots (270g), large dice \n* 12 Serrano Peppers (100g), seeds removed, large dice\n* 1 cup Green Olives (140g), pitted\n\n*8% Salt Brine (Day 1):*\n\n(Weight of water + veg) \\* (.08) = Salt Weight\n\n\\*\\*\\*Example Weight for Salt Brine:\n\nWeight of Veg with water just to cover - 2000g\n\n2000 \\* .08 = 160g\n\n*Pickling Liquid (Day 2-5):*\n\n* Water (half weight of Salt Brine)\n* Distilled White Vinegar (half weight of Salt Brine)\n* 3 tbsp Dried Thyme (9g)\n* 3 tbsp Dried Oregano (9g)\n* 1 tbsp Chili flakes (5g)\n* 6 Garlic cloves (30g), whole /peeled\n\nTECHNIQUE...\n\n1. Cut the veg into similar sized pieces. Fill just to cover with water. Record the weight of the water and veg, and add 8% kosher salt by weight. Set out a room temperature for one day.\n2. The next day, place a large bowl on a scale and zero it out. Drain the salty brine into the bowl, record the weight then discard the salty brine. To a medium sauce pan, add 50% of the weight of the liquid in water and the other 50% in white distilled vinegar. Add the spices and garlic to the pickling liquid, bring to a light boil and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3. Pour the pickling liquid over the veg, let cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. Let sit for 3 days before using.\n4. On day 3, strain the pickling liquid. Add the veg to a food processor and pulse to make a minced, \u201crelish-like\u201d, consistency. The giardiniera will last for a while in the fridge, at least 2-3 months.\n\nHOMEMADE Chicago-Style Giardiniera (Italian Pickle Condiment) - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Yf2GRlLQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Yf2GRlLQ4)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/nljfue/your_own_chicagostyle_giardiniera_italian_pickle/", "created_utc": 1622042131.0, "score": 56, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/nljfue/your_own_chicagostyle_giardiniera_italian_pickle/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Homemade Mustard from Scratch (3 Ways)", "selftext": "I never thought for a second to make homemade Dijon mustard, however now that I have a few pounds of corned beef on my hands I decided to do a deep dive into the world of mustards. What I came up on were dozens of recipes for dozens of different types of mustard. What was left after the mental distillation process were these 3 mustards: a refined and smooth \"Dijon-style\" mustard, a whole grain sweeter mustard made with beer, and a classic \"English\" style mustard made with yellow mustard powder. Each of these mustards has a time and place and I recommend giving them all a go! Below you'll find the recipes and techniques for each, plus a technique video for those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck!\n\n**French \u201cDijon\u201d Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 3/4 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/4 cup Dry White Wine\n* 2 tbsp White Wine Vinegar\n* 1-3 tbsp Water\n* 2 tsp Salt\n* 2 tsp Sugar\n\n1. Soak seeds overnight in enough water to cover.\n2. Drain seeds, place in mortar and pestle. Mash until the yellow seeds come out of the husks. This will take some time (about 10 mins.)\n3. Once you really begin to see the yellow seeds, slowly start incorporating the wine.\n4. Once all the wine is in, add the salt and sugar then slowly incorporate the vinegar. Grind until the mixture becomes fine.\n5. Once fine, adjust seasoning. Adding sweetness (sugar) will cut the bitterness, adding acid (vinegar/wine) will reduce the \u201cheat.\u201d\n6. Pass the mixture through a fine mesh sieve using the back of a spoon. Optionally, pass it through twice for a super smooth, yellow Dijon mustard.\n7. Store and refrigerate the mustard for a couple days before using. Doing so will allow the mustard to \u201cmature\u201d and reduce its heat.\n\n**English Style Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 1/2 cup Mustard Powder (Colman\u2019s Brand) \\*loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Water\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Sugar \n* 1/2 tsp Salt\n\n1. Whisk all ingredients together. Let stand for 15 minutes to thicken. Serve immediately. Seal and refrigerate to store.\n\n**Whole Grain Mustard (Beer Mustard)...**\n\n* 1/4 cup Yellow Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 cup Beer, divided\n* 5 tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 tsp Salt\n\n1. Soak the seeds with the vinegar and 1/ 2 cup of beer. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\n2. In a small sauce pan, mix the remaining 1/ 2 cup of beer with the sugar, salt and turmeric. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from the stove and let cool to room temperature.\n3. Into a blender, pour the mustard seeds and the soaking liquid and the beer syrup mixture.

{"title": "Home-Cured Corned Beef (for St. Patrick's Day)", "selftext": "When I think of corned beef the first thing I think of is a corned beef deli sandwich. Rye bread stacked high with corned beef, some grainy mustard and melted cheese... it's a glorious thing. Not until this year did I ever question how corned beef was made, but I'm glad I did. It turns out that making corned beef at home is pretty easy, all it takes is a bit of simple math and some patience.\n\nAfter some testing, I've come up on what I believe to be a pretty decent spice blend, cure ratio and end result and I'm stoked to share it with you all. Below you'll find the measurements and technique to make your own corned beef, from the ground up. For my visual people, I've also included a link to a cook-along video. Let me know if you have any questions here in the comments, I'm happy to help if I can. Good luck.\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 8-10 lb Beef Brisket \u201cflat\u201d, trimmed\n* Curing Salts (see below)\n* Corned Beef Spice Blend:\n* 3/ 4 cup Coriander (60g)\n* 3/ 4 cup Black Pepper (100g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Caraway Seed (25g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Brown Mustard Seed (50g)\n* 1/ 3 cup Star Anise (30g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Whole Mace (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Clove (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Allspice Berries (10g)\n* 2 tbsp Juniper Berry (10g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Chili Flake (15g)\n* 5 Fresh Bay Leaves (2 dry)\n* 1 Cinnamon stick (2.5g)\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\n1. Weight out spices, toast over low heat, then transfer to a mortar and pestle to crush. Remove half of the spice blend and set aside until we\u2019re ready to cook.\n2. Fill large container with water, take the waters weight, then add 5% salt and 3% brown sugar to it. Then add half the spice blend and stir until mixed well. Finally, add brisket and submerge. Use a ceramic bowl or non-reactive, food-safe thing to weigh the brisket down. Cover and label. Let sit in the fridge for 7-10 days, flipping the meat and stirring once daily.\n3. After 7-10 days remove corned beef from brine, rinse under running water. Discard brine. \n4. Place the brisket in a large pot, and pour in enough water to cover by a couple inches. Blanch meat for 5-10 minutes and skim off the scum that rises to the top.\n5. Once most of the scum is gone, add the remaining spice mix, crushed garlic and ginger then bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook, covered for 3-4 hours or until the brisket is fork tender. \n6. Towards the end, around hour 3 of the cooking process, add in red potatoes, carrots and cabbage then cover and simmer until tender, about 30-45 minutes.\n7. If the veggies finish cooking before the brisket, remove them and set aside until ready to serve.\n8. Once the beef is easily pierce-able with a knife, remove it from the pot and set it out on a sheet tray to cool slightly. \n9. Slice corned beef against the grain, on the bias. Serve with grainy mustard or mustard vinaigrette, the boiled vegetables from earlier, and dark beer.\n\n**TO MEASURE SALTS AND SUGAR...**\n\n* 5% Kosher Salt (of water weight) =\n   * (.05) \\* Water Weight in grams = Kosher Salt needed\n* 3% Brown Sugar (of water weight) =\n   * (.03) \\* Water Weight in grams = Sugar needed\n* Pink Salt should equal .50% of the total weight of the meat\u2026\n   * My brisket = 8lb = 3624g\u2026\n   * ...pink salt (.005)\\*3624 = 18.12g\n\n***How to Make Home-Cured Corned Beef -*** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc\\_IVKvddPM&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc_IVKvddPM&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "created_utc": 1614795698.0, "score": 24, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cassoulet - A simple guide to a not-so-simple dish...", "selftext": "Cassoulet is a complex meat and bean stew from the Southwest of France. Some believe Cassoulet to date back to the dark ages and others claim its actually ancient. Traditionally, it's made by loading a \"cassoul\" or clay casserole dish with many types of pork and duck, then topped with beans and cooked using a technique that leaves the upper beans crisp and the insides soft and unctuous. \n\nI spent the past week planning and gathering ingredients to make the famed French \"Cassoulet\" entirely from scratch. I wanted to challenge myself and indeed was it a challenge, but a fun one at that.\n\nI broke down a duck to confit the legs, I made fresh Toulouse sausage by hand, I simmered the beans with homemade ham that I brined and smoked and of course sourced the \"Tarbais\" beans from a specialty food website. All in all, a ton of work and effort went into making this cassoulet and I'm super amped to be able to share my recipe with you. Below you will find the ingredients for each component and it's technique. I also made a video on how to make the Cassoulet and all of its components if you'd rather watch than read. I hope this one finds you well and that, even if you cut some corners to save time, you give it a go!\n\n***FULL CASSOULET INGREDIENTS\u2026***\n\n**For the Beans...**\n\n* 2.5 pounds White Beans (1kg)\n* 1 Yellow Onion (375g)\n* 1 Carrot (56g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Tomato Paste (28g)\n* 3 medium Tomatoes (528g)\n* 5 Garlic cloves (15g)\n* 6-8 cups Chicken Stock (plus 2-3 cups more for later)\n* 2/ 3 lb Pork Belly (300g)\n* 1/ 2 lb Ham\n* 3 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Duck Fat (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Salt (35g)\n\n**For the Herb Sachet in the Beans...**\n\n* Small Bundle Fresh thyme (5g)\n* Small Bundle Fresh Parsley (9g)\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 1 tsp Black Peppercorn (3g)\n* 1 tsp Juniper Berries(2g)\n* 4 cloves (.5g)\n\n**Additional Meat for the final Cassoulet\u2026**\n\n* 4-5 Pork Spare Ribs (400g)\n* 3 six inch Toulouse Sausage Links(400g)\n* Bundle of Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 2 tbsp Duck Fat (30ml)\n\n**Duck Confit\u2026** \n\n* 4-6 Duck Legs\n* Duck Fat to submerge legs\n* Thyme (fresh, picked and pressed in)\n* Zest from half an Orange\n* 6 Garlic Cloves (1 per leg)\n* Salt (about a half teaspoon per leg)\n* Cracked Black Pepper TT\n\n**Toulouse Sausage\u2026 (recipe yields 5 lb or 15-20 links)**\n\n* 3.5 pounds Pork Shoulder (1.6 kg)\n* 1.5 pounds Fatback (680g)\n* 3/4 cup White Wine (175ml)\n* 1/4 cup Brandy (60ml)\n* 3 tablespoons Kosher salt (40g)\n* 3 tablespoons minced garlic (50g, 15-20 cloves)\n* 1 tablespoons ground black pepper 8g\n* 1 tablespoon ground white pepper 8g\n* 1 teaspoon Nutmeg, freshly grated (optional)\n* 10-12 feet Natural Hog Casings (32-38mm)\n\n\\*serve with additional red wine vinegar and a nice bottle of light red wine.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nToulouse Sausage...\n\n1. Cut up pork belly and back fat into small-medium pieces manageable for the grinder. Toss the meat in the pepper, garlic, nutmeg and salt and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. Begin soaking the hog casings in a small bowl of cold water, set aside.\n2. Grind the mixture through a \u201cchunky\u201d (8mm) die and onto a sheet tray.\n3. Once all the meat is ground, add it to the bowl of the stand mixer and, with the paddle attachment on, mix the meat on low for a minute. After a minute, add the wine and brandy, then increase the speed to medium and mix for a minute or two longer. The liquid should be completely incorporated and the meat should look sticky.\n4. Optionally, fry up a bit of the meat and taste test it for seasoning.\n5. Set up the sausage stuffer on the stand mixer and stuff the ground meat into the hog casings.\n6. Tie off one end of the hog casing. Use one hand to help the casing off of the nozzle, and the other to guide the sausage onto the sheet tray.\n7. After stuffing, if forming links, poke holes in the sausage coil to make sure it doesn\u2019t burst while twisting. To form links, twist the sausage every 6-7 inches. If serving to a crowd, you can also leave the whole sausage in a coil and cook the sausage as is.\n8. Cook the sausage to an internal temperature of 160F, serve however you damn well please. Son. \n\nDuck Confit\u2026\n\n1. The day before cooking, season the duck legs liberally with salt and press the aromatics into the legs. Cover the tray with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days.\n2. The next day, remove the duck legs from the tray and rinse under cold running water. Do your best to remove all the salt and aromatics, then pat dry.\n3. Place the duck legs in a container taller than it is wide, submerge the legs in the duck fat, cook on 200F (93c) for 6 hours, or until their tender.\n   1. At first the legs will float, but as they cook and release water and air, they will sink to the bottom.\n   2. At first the cooking fat will be cloudy, when the legs are nearly done the fat will be clear.\n   3. If cooking the confit sous vide, season the legs with salt (not too much compared to conventional confit), then pack in your aromatics and cook sous vide for 185F (85c) for 6-8 hours for a \u201cshreddy\u201d classic confit consistency. Then chill down, in the bag, in an ice bath. Store in the fridge before using.\n4. Remove the duck legs from the oven and let them cool to room temperature in the fat. Once cooled to room temperature, if you intend to keep them in the fridge for a while, keep them in the fat to let their flavor develop. If you plan to use sooner, you can store them in a plastic bag or air-tight container. \n5. To prepare the confit, pour some fat onto a sheet tray, place the legs on and roast, skin side up, on 350F for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed. The crisp under the broiler for a couple minutes.\n\nCassoulet Beans\u2026\n\n1. Cover Beans with a few inches of water, and set aside to soak overnight. The next day rinse and drain, then set aside.\n2. In a large dutch oven, pad the bottom of the pot with the pork belly and cured ham (prevents the beans from sticking) then cover with the chicken stock. The beans should be covered by at least an inch or two of stock.\n3. Add the onion, carrot, tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic cloves, red wine vinegar, duck fat, and the herb sachet (thyme, parsley, bay, cloves, peppercorns, juniper berries).\n4. Cook gently on medium heat for an hour to an hour and a half, or until the beans are just tender. You want the beans to stop cooking just as they begin turning tender to avoid overcooking into mush.\n5. Once the beans are tender, remove the pot from the heat. Remove and discard all of the aromatic vegetables and herb sachet. Set the pork belly and cured ham aside for later use. Cover the beans up and let them hang out in their juices until we need them later.\n\nTo assemble the Cassoulet\u2026\n\n1. Start by roasting the toulouse sausage and pork ribs. Place the ribs and sausage in a pan and brown with duck fat and thyme. Once browned, deglaze the pan with water and add the jus to the bean cooking liquid. Set the meat aside for later.Place the pork ribs and sausage in a large roasting tray. Add a branch of thyme, a bay leaf, and 5 garlic cloves, and a drizzle of duck fat and oil. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the meat has some coloring.\n2. Place all the meats at the bottom of the pot.Optionally shred up a confit leg and add it to the mix. Use a slotted spoon, or something similar to spoon the beans, without the liquid, over the meat. Once the pot is layered and filled Use the bean cooking liquid to fill the dutch oven to the top of the beans.\n3. Bake in a 400F oven for 1 and a half hours. Check the beans twice, every 30 minutes to push the crust down and add a bit more bean cooking liquid (or chicken stock if you ran out). This remoistening process is going to allow the cassoulet to get very crispy without totally burning.\n4. During the last 15 minutes of cooking, about an hour and fifteen minutes into the process, put the confit duck on a sheet tray and add to the oven. With the cassoulet. Remove the cassoulet, then broil the duck confit until the skin is crispy then add it to the top of the finished cassoulet.\n5. Remove cassoulet from oven, serve with a bit of red wine vinegar (a condiment that helps cut through the richness and ease digestion.)\n\n*Example Workflow...*\n\nDay 1 - Break down duck, render fat, begin Cure for Duck Legs, Make Toulouse sausage.\n\nDay 2- Remove duck from cure, confit duck.

{"title": "Homemade Lasagna with Bolognese", "selftext": "Lasagna is a classic dish that can tell you a lot about a cook. There are dozens of ways to make the Italian classic... from utilizing different pasta types to adding all sorts of vegetables, or simply opting for a ragu of sorts and cheese. Making lasagna from scratch calls to a cooks ability to make a decent ragu (meat sauce), make homemade pasta sheets, and, if one opts for it, getting creative with the way the \"casserole\" is layered.\n\nBelow is my adaptation on a \"classic\" lasagna. If you want to have a whack at making it, I've left the technique and measurement list (in both weights and Imperial). I'll also go ahead and link to a video that I created for those of you who prefer something visual. I spent a lot of time on this, so I hope it helps you save some of your own! Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck!\n\n**RECIPE** (Serves 8...)\n\nFor Lasagna\u2026\n\n* 5.5 cups (200g) Parmigiano Reggiano\n* 1.5 cups (80g) Low-Moisture, full-fat Mozzarella\n* Fresh Basil and/or Parsley TT - garnish\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n* 4 cups (510g) Type \u201c00\u201d Flour\n* 4 (230g) Whole Eggs\n* 5 (90g) Egg Yolks\n\nBechamel (\u201cbesciamella\u201d)\u2026\n\n* 2 tbsp (30g) Butter\n* 3 tbsp (30g) Flour\n* 2 cups (474ml) Whole Milk\n* 1 cup (25g) Parmigiano Reggiano, grated\n* Ground Nutmeg TT\n* Salt & Pepper TT\n\nItalian Sausage Ragu \u201cBolognese\u201d...\n\n(Makes 10-12 servings)\n\n* 4 tbsp (60g) Butter\n* 1lb (454g) Italian Pork Sausage\n* 1lb (454g) Ground Beef Chuck\n* 1 large Onion/ 1.5 cups (320g)\n* 3 large Ribs Celery/ 1 cup (100g)\n* 2 large Carrots/ 1 cup (125g)\n* 5 cloves of garlic, minced (8g)\n* 28oz can San Marzano tomatoes (828ml)\n* 1.5 cups White Wine (355ml)\n* 2 cups Whole Milk (474ml)\n* 2 cups Veal or Beef Stock (474ml)\n* Herb Sachet - Fresh Thyme, Oregano, Bay leaf\n* Chili Flakes TT\n* Fish Sauce TT\n* (optional) Rinds from Parmigiano Reggiano TT\n\nTT= to taste\n\n\\*This recipe makes more Ragu than you\u2019re going to need for the lasagna. The ragu freezes well and will stay fresh for 3-5 months in the freezer.\n\n\\*\\*You could end up with extra pasta sheets, too. It\u2019s better to have some left over, then to be short on sheets. If you have leftover, cut the sheets into any shape you want and chill in an air-tight container. Boom. Fresh pasta for later in the week.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n1. Make a mound with the flour and use your fingers to create a well.\n2. Drop the whole eggs and egg yolks in the middle, whisk with a fork, and slowly begin collapsing in flour into the beaten egg and egg yolk mixture.\n3. Once the eggs have been worked into the flour, drop the fork and begin kneading by hand.\n4. Knead for 5-10 minutes, or until the dough is smoothed out.  \n\n   1. Add in a sprinkle or two of water if the dough is looking a bit dry.\n5. Wrap in plastic and set aside. Let rest for 30 minutes.  \n\n   1. Allowing the dough the time to rest will make it more supple, and easier to work with. If you don\u2019t let it rest, it will remain hard to roll out and pull back on you.\n6. Flour a sheet tray heavily and set it aside at the ready.\n7. After 30 minutes remove the plastic from the pasta and portion out into 4 quarters.\n8. Grab one quarter from the bunch, and cover the remaining pasta chunks with the plastic wrap so that they don\u2019t dry out.\n9. Form the pasta chunk into a 5-6 inch circle, dust with flour, then run the dough through the pasta machine starting at width 0.\n10. After the first pass, fold the two ends over each other, and run it through again. Repeat one or two more times.\n11. One the sheet is flat and even, increase the pasta machine width to setting 1, flour the dough again, then run the dough through. Repeat this process working your way up to setting 6.\n12. You should be able to see the silhouette of your hand through the dough.\n13. Skimping on flouring the pasta dough as you run it through the machine could lead you to torn pasta sheets. Flour is important.\n14. Place the WELL FLOURED pasta sheets back onto a sheet tray as you work.\n15. Once the pasta sheet are rolled out, portion the sheets into 13 inch long pieces (big enough to fit in your cooking vessel), flour, and set aside again.\n16. Cook the sheets in well-seasoned water for 30-45 seconds, or until just cooked but still al dente.\n17. As the sheets finish cooking, place them on the rack and sprinkle with oil to avoid sticking and overlap.\n18. Do this step lastly, right before you\u2019re ready to build the lasagne.\n\nRagu Bolognese\u2026\n\n1. Form ground meat into sausage patties, season with salt, and brown in a dutch oven, Once browned, reserve on a plate.\n2. Drain a bit of the excess fat from the dutch oven, melt the butter then add in your carrots, celery, onion and garlic. Cook the veg down for 5-10 minutes.\n3. Add the reserved browned ground meat back into the dutch oven and crumble using the back of a wooden spoon or something similar.\n4. Once the veg and meat mixture is crumbled, deglaze the bottom of the pan with the white wine, scraping all the brown bits off the bottom of the dutch oven. Cook the mixture on high heat until the wine reduces by nearly half. 7-8 minutes.\n5. Once the wine is reduced, add the milk. Again, cook over high heat until the milk is near fully reduced, another 10 minutes or so.\n6. Once the mixture is almost dry, pour in the San Marzano tomatoes and veal stock and stir until combined.\n7. Finally, add in the herb sachet, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2-4 hours.  \n\n   1. The longer its simmered, the more flavorful it will be.\n8. After time simmering, optionally pulse the bolognese with an immersion blender to get a smooth yet textured consistency.  \n\n   1. The bolognese will be significantly reduced after simmering for so long. Feel free to add in more stock or water for a looser consistency. I prefer to leave mine reduced for a chunkier sauce.\n   2. Control the finally consistency of your ragu by pulsing it as much or as little as you like with an immersion blender.\n   3. The immersion blender allows texture control, but also helps emulsify some of the fat in the sauce into the liquid giving a gorgeous light orangish-brown color to the ragu.\n9. Once the desired consistency is achieved, season the sauce with fish sauce, salt, and pepper TT, put the lid on the dutch oven, and set aside.\n\nBechamel...\n\n1. Add butter and flour to a medium saucepan and cook for 5 minutes, or until the roux smells like pie crust - Chef John.\n2. Slowly whisk in COLD milk (no lumps), then grate in nutmeg, salt and pepper TT. Optionally add a bit of parm to the bechamel (technically making it into a mornay sauce.)\n3. Bring the mixture up to a boil, then cut the heat. When the Roux begins to bubble is when it\u2019s at its maximum thickening power. If your roux looks too thin, start over.\n4. Let cool for a few minutes, then lay some plastic wrap over the top of the bechamel and cover with a lid so a skin doesn\u2019t form, set it aside.\n\nTo assemble Lasagne\u2026\n\n1. Lay down a bit of bolognese and bechamel then the first layer of pasta.\n2. Lay down another layer of bolognese, bechamel, AND parmesan cheese. Finish with more pasta sheets to cover. Rinse and repeat.  \n\n   1. You should still be able to see the bottom pasta sheet once the bolognese is ladeled in, don\u2019t overdo the sauces in each layer.\n3. Finish the lasagne by pulling over two of the sheets to form a \u201cbowl\u201d then lay on the remaining bechamel sauce, a dollop of red sauce (mostly for color) and a little more parm.\n4. Cover with parchment paper, then tin foil and bake at 400F for 35 minutes.\n5. After 35 minutes, remove the parchment and foil, sprinkle on the mozzarella cheese and broil for 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and browned.\n6. Let rest for AT LEAST 30 minutes before slicing and serving.  \n\n   1. If you cut into the lasagne early, it\u2019ll still taste great\u2026 but you might get 3rd degree burns on the roof of your mouth and it could fall apart on you making all the layer work you just did worthless. Butttt it\u2019s your call, I won\u2019t get between a hungry human and a lasagne.\n7. Garnish with chopped parsley and basil.\n\n**A Guide to Homemade Lasagna (from scratch)** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "created_utc": 1611166989.0, "score": 21, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Split Pea Soup with Home-Cured Ham", "selftext": "Split pea soup is a popular way to use leftover ham for a good reason. It's chunky, rich and tasty. The smoke lent from a good leftover ham bone or fresh ham hock lends a smokey, porky taste that's hard to find in other vegetable-based soups. Split pea begins its journey in a solid state, with hard split peas and other lone ingredients scattered about, then over the long simmering process things change and the soup turns into the creamy, puree we all know and love.\n\nI made a giant ham from scratch a few weeks back so I was sitting on a leftover femur, aiche and shank bone... what better way to utilize the bones and leftover stew meat than making Split Pea Soup!? I ended up making a big batch of soup, saving some to eat throughout the week and freezing the rest for a quick dinner later in the month.\n\nBelow you'll find the ingredients and technique for my Split Pea Soup recipe. As usual, I'll also include a link to a video to those of you who prefer something visual. Feel free to sub out yellow split peas for green, and to use a fresh smoked ham hock or something similar if you don't have leftover ham bones in your freezer (likely the majority of you.) I hope this helps!\n\n**Split Pea Soup INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter (30g)\n* 1 Yellow Onion, diced (320g)\n* 5 Celery Stalks, diced (140g)\n* 4 Medium Carrots, peeled + diced (205g)\n* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced (8g)\n* 1/ 2 cup Dry Sherry Wine (125ml) \\*see note\n* 1 lb Dried Split Peas (454g)\n* 8 cups Chicken Stock (1893ml)\n* 2 cups Ham, shredded or diced (260g) \\*see note\n* 5 sprigs Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Fresh Bay Leaves\n* Ham Bones - femur, shank and aiche \\*see note\n\n*Salt + Pepper TT*\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n*\\*Feel free to use store-bought ham, or sub for fresh thick-cut bacon.*\n\n*\\*\\*Pork stock can be subbed for Chicken. Just make sure it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d stock and has plenty of collagen.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Sub Dry Sherry Wine for white wine, or Madeira wine.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Whole ham bones are optional, but do make a big difference in the soups flavor. Ask your butcher for leftover bones, or sub out for a smoked ham hock.*\n\n**Split Pea Soup Technique:**\n\n1. Start the ham bone. Roast the ham bone in a 500F oven until charred and roasty. About 10-15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.\n2. Add butter to dutch oven, season and sweat mirepoix and garlic until onions and celery are translucent. About 10 minutes.\n3. Deglaze dutch oven with wine, cook off the wine until the wine reduces by half. About 4 minutes.\n4. Add dried split peas to dutch oven along with thyme and bay leaves. Season with black pepper and mix.\n5. Add the chicken stock and roasted ham bones if using. Simmer the soup, uncovered for 1 hour and 45 mins.\n   1. Be careful when seasoning, the soup will reduce and the ham is already pretty salty.\n   2. Over time the split peas will fall apart giving the soup its classic, thick split pea look.\n6. Add the ham pieces and continue simmering for another 15 minutes.\n7. After two hours, remove the soup from the heat and let cool. Serve with creme fraiche, crusty bread, and more ham pieces if you\u2019re feeling like a big boy.\n8. Split pea soup can be kept in the fridge for 3 or 4 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.\n\n**Split Pea Soup (with Home-cured Ham) -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "created_utc": 1610556244.0, "score": 31, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "html_title": ""}

I tried about 10 different recipes people sent to me and they were helpful, but I felt like they never quite reached the texture I wanted.\n\nMy family got me modern cuisine at home for my birthday and I have used it off and on with great success. However, the best thing it's given me so far is the nicest pizza dough ever. It's perfect chewiness and amazing flavor.\n\nI've been reading a food science book as well that has helped me learn that certain brands and certain types of materials matter in cooking. \n\nHere is the recipe I used. Hope you have a great outcome like me! I used weight for the flour as I find it more consistent.\n\n* 00 wheat flour (Antimo Caputo) - 500g or 3+3/4 cup\n* Room temp Water - 310g/mL or 1+1/2 cup\n* Pure Honey - 10g or 2 tsp\n* Salt (kosher diamond crystal) - 10g or 2+1/2 tsp\n* Vital Wheat Gluten (red mill) - 2.5g or 1+1/2 tsp\n* Active Dry Yeast (Antimo Caputo) - 2.5g or 3/4 tsp\n\nMix everything in a bowl (adding water last) using bread hook on medium for 5 minutes. Rest for 10 minutes at room temp and mix 5 more minutes. Cut into 2,3,4 smaller sections. Stretch for about 30 seconds and roll into nice round ball. Use grape seed oil to lightly oil a bowl, put the dough inside and flip over so both sides are oiled. Put a plastic wrap overtop and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or best off do it for 1 day. \n\nMake sure to take out 1 hour ahead of time. Heat up oven to 500 degrees and heat up pizza stone inside. Transfer pizza and cook for 4-8 minutes depending on size.\n\nEnjoy! As a note I used olive oil on the crust (Partana extra virgin). I think it brought some extra flavor.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kiklmk/modern_cuisine_at_home_neopolitan_pizza_dough/", "created_utc": 1608692372.0, "score": 29, "author": "dragons_fire77", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kiklmk/modern_cuisine_at_home_neopolitan_pizza_dough/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Home-Cured, Glazed and Smoked Whole Holiday Ham", "selftext": "Ham reminds me of cartoons from the 1950-60s. Those big ornate, steaming hams decorated with pineapple rings, cherries and cloves... definitely the food of yesterday. Then I got to thinking, why do I never see whole hams presented at the market or even at most well-stocked butchers? The fact is, people just don't make whole ham on the reg like they used to. Thus, marking the beginning of my quest to make a classic cured, glazed and smoked ham from scratch in my home kitchen.\n\nMy adventure started by researching all about curing and curing salts. I spoke with a handful of my chef friends and picked the mind of a great local butcher. Then I delved into making a yummy, holiday-y maple/dijon glaze and finally figured out how to turn my Weber kettle charcoal grill into a smoker.\n\nAfter a few weeks of planning and testing, I came up on some accurate brine/curing measurements and what I believe to be a sound technique and recipe to make a whole ham. I'm going to provide a picture, the technique and all of my measurements in the post below. I'm also going to provide a video for those of you who prefer something visual. We still have time before Christmas and New Years - this could be a fun project to undertake for the holidays! Good luck, let me know if you have any questions.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*My Cure/Brine Measurements\u2026*\n\n* *Total Ham Weight - 14.5lb (6578g)*\n* *Total Ham Weight (w/o bone) - 10.5lb (4762g)*\n* *Bone Weight - 3-4lb (1814g)*\n* *Water - 4qt (1 gallon) = 3800g \\* 3 = 11400g*\n* *5% Salt of water weight = 570g*\n* *3% Sugar of water weight = 342g*\n* Pink Salt (.25% of meat weight) - (4762g \\* .0025) = 11.92 \\~ 12g Pink Salt aka Prague Powder #1\n\n*\\*\\*\\*(Salt %* *x Water Weight = Total Kosher Salt weight)*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Use the same equation to calculate Total Sugar Weight*\n\n\\*\\*\\*I\u2019ve spoken to many amazing professional cooks and chefs, butchers about pink salt and everybody gave me a different answer in terms of how to use it. However one thing was constant - a little goes a long way. Too much of this stuff can be toxic, so take it easy. Less is more.\n\n*Maple-Dijon Ham Glaze\u2026*\n\n* 1 Cup Dark Brown Sugar\n* 1/ 2 Cup Dark Maple Syrup\n* 1/ 4 Cup Dijon Mustard\n* 1/ 4 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder\n* 1/ 2 Tsp Ground Clove\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n**Technique\u2026**\n\n1. Score ham.\n2. Weigh and record ham. Use weight of ham to then measure out .25% pink salt #1 and set aside.\n3. Take weight of large brining vessel and zero scale. Add the ham to the vessel and fill with water until the meat is submerged by a few inches. Remove the ham and record the weight of the water.\n4. Measure out 5% salt and 3% sugar by weight of the water.\n   1. This is a traditional gradient brine, not to be mistaken with an ultra precise equilibrium.\n5. Mix salt, sugar and pink salt into the cold water in the large vessel until dissolved.\n6. Place the ham on a large sheet tray and inject the meat a few times all over. Once injected, place the ham in the brine, cover and refrigerate.\n   1. The ham should brine at a rate of 2lb per day. So if you have a 15lb ham, keep it in the brine for about a week.\n7. Stir the brine on day 2, inject again on day 4, stir once more on day 5 then remove the ham from the brine on day 7.\n   1. Feel free to stir the brine every day if possible.\n8. Rinse the ham thoroughly under running water, then pat dry. Let the ham rest uncovered on a rack in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n   1. This stage will allow something called a pellicle to form, which will allow an outer crust to form when cooked and help the smoke adhere to the ham.\n9. Smoke the ham in a 200F smoker until the internal temp reads 130-140F.\n10. Meanwhile, make the glaze by mixing together glaze ingredients and cooking down until viscous.\n11. After 2 hours, brush the ham with glaze, then cover.\n12. After another hour or so, glaze the ham again and smoke until the internal temp hits 130-140F. Bring the ham back inside, glaze again, and finish cooking in a 250F oven until the internal temp hits 155F.\n13. If serving immediately, let rest for at least 45 minutes before carving.\n14. If cooking ahead, chill down the ham. The next day, carve the ham then set it on a tray to warm it in a very low oven. Once warmed through, plate pieces on a presentation platter and serve immediately.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "created_utc": 1608136994.0, "score": 38, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "html_title": ""}

To keep myself busy, I've been re-writing Thanksgiving recipes for my friends and me in an easy-to-learn way. I've done this by focusing on cooking\u00a0*skills progression.*\n\nA little background: As I was training my staff, I discovered a recipe format that made learning and executing so much quicker. I simply focused on labeling the\u00a0*underlying technique*\u00a0behind each step. This anchor point helped my cooks quickly connect what they already knew to what they were doing. By focusing on techniques that are shared across many different recipes, practicing a particular recipe meant they were getting better at making related recipes.\n\nI found this practice of breaking kitchen skills into small discrete units helped cooks quickly grasp what I was asking of them and greatly expedited the learning curve. Cooks knew whether they were trained in a specific skill or not. And if not, they could get up to speed quickly.\n\nMy friends and I ([deepakChopra707](https://www.reddit.com/user/deepakChopra707/)\u00a0&\u00a0[mizzao](https://www.reddit.com/user/mizzao/)) have recently created a mobile web app that encompasses all these ideas.

{"title": "Making Tofu with Fresh Soybeans", "selftext": "I love tofu. I know plenty of people out there who like to hate on it, but the fact is - Tofu is what you make it. The sauce, cooking technique and a number of other factors is what determines if the tofu is good or bad. One largely overlooked factor, in modern times at least, is the quality of the actual soybeans used to make the tofu and the tofu itself. Like any other protein or vegetable, there is a noticeable difference between good and bad tofu. I've been lucky enough to live near a market that sells super great, homemade tofu that I buy regularly. However, as of recent fall is in full effect and my local farmer's markets are beginning to close for the season... so I decided to have a whack at making my own soybean tofu, from scratch, at home and it turned out GREAT!\n\nTofu making is a super fun, different cooking project that is surprisingly simple and fairly inexpensive to make. Plus, like eating homemade pasta, there's something about eating tofu made by your own hands that is mega satisfying. I'm going to leave the recipe, technique directions and a short explainer video for my visual people below. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.\n\n*Tofu Ingredients:*\n\n* 310g Soaked Soybeans (2 cups)\n* 946ml Water (4 cups)\n* 15ml Liquid Nigari (1 tbsp), or other \"coagulant\"\n* 30ml Water for mixing Nigari (2 tbsp)\n\n*Tofu Technique:*\n\n1. Submerge 2 cups of soybeans in water and soak overnight. \\*This will yield more beans than you need for one portion from this recipe, but I like the \"insurance policy.\"\n2. Drain the soaked soybeans and add 2 cups of soaked soybeans to a blender along with 4 cups of water. Blend until smooth.\n3. Pour into sauce pan and bring up to a boil on medium heat, then reduce to simmer and simmer for 10 minutes. Skim the top foam.\n4. Pour the bean water mixture into a strainer lined with cheese cloth positioning a bowl underneath to catch the liquid. This liquid is our fresh soymilk.  \n\n   1. Squeeze the bean mash in the cheese cloth to fully drain it. Reserve this mash, it makes a great stew, but that's another recipe.\n5. Add 1 tbsp of liquid Nigari to 2 tbsp of water, mix and set aside.\n6. Pour the fresh soy milk in another sauce pan and over low-medium heat, bring it to 170F (76c).\n7. Once the tofu mixture hits 170F, cut the heat and gently add in half of the Nigari water mixture. Stir gently and pop the lid on. Let this sit for 5 minutes, then repeat the process with the remaining nigari mixture.\n8. By now the curd should be separated from the whey. Pour the mixture into a tofu mold lined with cheesecloth, put a weight on top, and let the press the tofu to your desired firmness. The longer the press, the firmer the tofu.  \n\n   1. A good starting place is 5 minutes for soft tofu, 7 for medium and 10+ minutes for anything firm.\n9. Store the pressed tofu in cold water and let chill for at least 30 minutes before eating. This will help tighten things up and give it a nice texture, even if you prefer your tofu on the softer side.\n10. Use immediately, or store in water, refrdgerated for 4 or 5 days.\n\n**Making Tofu from Scratch with Fresh Soybeans -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2\\_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "created_utc": 1603294694.0, "score": 40, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Recreating Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza at Home from Dough to Sausage...", "selftext": "I'm from Chicago. Around these parts 2 pizza styles reign - Tavern Style thin crust, and the infamous Deep Dish pizza (which many argue is more like a casserole.) Though I find myself surrounded with deep dish joints and a number of great deep dish options, I wanted to have a whack at making it myself, from scratch, at home.\n\nBelow is are my measurements/weights and recipe for what I believe to be a pretty solid technique for making domestic deep dish. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below. I'm happy to help in any way that I can. For my visual people, I've also provided a link to the cook-along video. Everything will be listed below. Go bersss.\n\n**THE DOUGH\u2026** \n\n\\*\\*\\*enough for 10-12in cast iron pan.\n\n* 250g Bread Flour\n* 25g corn meal \n* 75g Olive Oil\n* 100g Warm Water (110F)\n* 3g Instant Yeast\n* 5g Salt\n\n**THE TOMATO SAUCE\u2026**\n\n* 465g San Marzano Tomatoes, drained\n* 2g Kosher Salt\n* 2g Sugar\n* 2g Red Wine Vinegar\n* 2g Dried Oregano\n* Fish Sauce TT (optional)\n\n**THE CHEESE\u2026**\n\n\\*\\*\\*50/50 Whole Milk Mozzarella / Part-skim Mozzarella... makes roughly 1 lb.\n\n* 225g Part-skim Mozzarella\n* 225g Whole Milk Mozzarella\n\n**THE PARM CRUMBLE\u2026**\n\n\\*Add a medium hunk of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to a blender or food processor and blitz it up into small crumbles. The leftover crumble saves well in the fridge and come in handy for other stuff.\n\n**\u201cSPICY\u201d ITALIAN SAUSAGE SPICE BLEND\u2026**\n\n* 3lb Pork Shoulder \n* 1lb Pork Belly (33% fat)\n* 30g Kosher Salt (3 tbsp)\n* 33g Sugar (2 tbsp)\n* 8g Fennel Seed (whole, toasted. 1.5 tbsp)\n* 2g Coriander Seed (whole, toasted, 1/ 2 tbsp)\n* 16g Sweet Paprika (2 tbsp)\n* 6g Dried Oregano (2.5 tbsp)\n* 6g Dried Basil (2.5 tbsp)\n* 6 Garlic, minced (2 cloves)\n* 8g Red Chili Flake (1.5 tbsp) \\*\\*\\*leave out for mild sausage\n* 9g Black Peppercorn (whole, toasted, 1.5 tbsp)\n* 1/2 Cup Ice Water\n* 1/4 White Wine\n\nTECHNIQUE:\n\n1. Stir flour, corn meal, yeast, salt and olive oil together.\n   1. We usually don\u2019t add salt to the dough because it slows gluten formation, but in this case we don\u2019t care about gluten formation so add it all in.\n2. Mix together long enough to form a shaggy dough, then cover and autolyse for 20-30mins at room temp.\n3. After autolyse, mix in water. Knead dough on speed 2 with dough hook for 4 mins, let dough rest for 4 minutes, then knead on speed 2 for additional 4 minutes.\n4. Round dough off, cover, and place in airtight container to bulk ferment for 2-3 hours, or until dough doubles.\n5. Preheat oven to 425F (218c).\n6. Pulse tomatoes with blender, and drain so that only chunks remain. Season tomato chunks with ingredients listed.\n7. Grate cheese, set aside.\n8. \\*\\*\\* The sausage deserves a video all on it's own and would make this recipe 4x the length. For the sausage, I'll refer you a technique video, but the ingredients above are all you need. Or opt out of this step and buy bulk Italian sausage.\n9. Butter 10 or 12 inch cast iron heavily, then sprinkle in some grated parmesan to coat the bottom and sidewalls.\n10. Use your fingers to spread the dough out, then line it in the cast iron.\n11. Lay in the cheese, then Italian sausage, then drained and seasoned diced tomatoes. Top with more parmesan crumbles.\n12. Cook the pizza on the stovetop for 5-10 minutes to give the bottom of the crust head start crisping.\n13. Transfer the pizza into the middle oven rack and bake for 30-40 mins or until the crust is a golden brown all around and pizza it hot.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Most of the time we don\u2019t add salt or sugar to the dough before autolyse because it can inhibit gluten formation, but in this case we don\u2019t care about gluten so we can add the salt to the dough early.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Stirring in the fat first stops gluten from forming heavily which makes for a flakier crust.\n\n\\*\\*\\*High fat, low hydration dough which eats more like a biscuit and helps wick away moisture from the meat, cheese and tomato sauce.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Adding the fatty cheese first helps wick away moisture from the sausage and tomatoes sauce.\n\n**Making Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza from Scratch** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fL8uLuXkl8&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fL8uLuXkl8&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)\n\nBulk Italian Sausage - https://studio.youtube.com/video/b-GZjJrlzNQ/edit/basic", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/jb2hee/recreating_chicagostyle_deep_dish_pizza_at_home/", "created_utc": 1602688248.0, "score": 48, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/jb2hee/recreating_chicagostyle_deep_dish_pizza_at_home/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Wisconsin Style Bratwurst (Braised in Beer)", "selftext": "I'm from Chicago. To those of you who, like myself, are geographically challenged, Chicago is just south from Wisconsin. Wisconsin is known for 3 foods... beer, cheese and brats... giving the holy trinity a new meaning.\n\nBecause we're in the midst of Oktoberfest and to honor the Midwestern United States, my home, I decided to delve into the world of bratwurst and have a whack at making my own \"Sheboygan\" style brats. Sheboygan county in Wisconsin is the home of the bratwurst here in the U.S. and the area responsible for making the \"brat\" go mainstream here. The recipe is posted below, let me know if you have any questions.\n\nP.S. I've included a video for my visual people who would like to cook along. Prost!\n\n*BRATWURST MEAT...*\n\n* 4lb (1814g) Lean Pork\n* lb (453g) Pork Fat (makes 25% fat sausage)\n* 40g (4 tbsp) Kosher Salt\n* \\*Feel free to run the sausage a second time through a smaller die for a finer texture.\n* \\*\\*Roughly 10g (1 tbsp) salt per lb of sausage meat.\n\n*\u201cSHEBOYGAN\u201d SPICE BLEND: (enough for 5 lb of sausages)*\n\n* 1.5g (3 tsp) Dried Marjoram\n* 7g (2 tsp) Garlic Powder\n* 4g (2 tsp) Ginger Powder\n* 3g (6 pods) Whole Mace\n* 4g (2 tsp) Whole Allspice\n* 5g (2 tsp) Whole Caraway Seed\n* 6g (2 tsp) Whole Black Peppercorn\n* 40g (4 tbsp) Kosher Salt \\*1 tbsp per lb of protein\n* 10g (1 tbsp) Cane Sugar\n* 45ml (3 tbsp) Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 45ml (3 tbsp) Ice Water \\*add more for smoother texture\n\n\\*Toast appropriate spices then blend together. \n\n*BEER GRAVY BRAISED BRATS...*\n\n* 6-8 Bratwurst\n* 570g (2 whole) Yellow Onions\n* 15g (1-2 cloves) Garlic, minced\n* 2g (2 tsp) Black Pepper, ground\n* 3g (1 tsp) Paprika\n* 12g (2 tsp) Dark Brown Sugar\n* 12oz (1 can) Dark Beer \\*Oktoberfest is best\n* 42g (3 tbsp) Unsalted Butter\n* 8g (1 tbsp) AP Flour \n* Kosher Salt to taste\n* Optional Mustard/Sauerkraut\n\n*BEER MUSTARD*\n\n* 1/ 2 cup Yellow Mustard Seed\n* 1/ 2 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1 cup Dark Beer (Oktoberfest Marzen Lager)\n* 1/ 2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 2 tbsp Dark Brown Sugar\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n\\*Let beer/mustard/vinegar soak for a day in fridge then blitz in blender.\n\n\\*ferment 2-3 days submerged and covered at room temp.\n\n\\*Store in the fridge for 1-2 months.\n\n*SAUERKRAUT*\n\n* 2lb Cabbage/Veg\n* 1 tbsp Kosher Salt\n* Seasonings - dried herbs, spices, etc.\n\n\\*ferment 3-30 days submerged and covered at room temp\n\n\\*Store in the fridge indefinitely. Use common sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTECHNIQUE FOR SAUSAGE MAKING...\n\n1. Place all meat grinder equipment in freezer for at least 30 minutes. Soak hog casing in water for 30 mins.\n   1. Make sure casings are the right size. Some come packed in salt, so rinse the casings with water if that\u2019s the case for you. Any good butcher should sell hog casings.\n2. Dice meat and fat into small cubes, place on metal sheet tray then transfer to the freezer for 20 minutes or so.\n   1. The meat is easier to work with and holds its texture when cold, easier on your stand mixer. Making sure everything that touches the meat is cold ensures a healthy saaaasage. That fat will separate from the meat if warm - Stella culinary \n3. Measure out the spices and herbs. Toast appropriate spices on stovetop, then transfer to grinder and blend. Work spices mixture into cubed meat until evenly coated. Set aside.\n   1. Don\u2019t toast the dried herbs, they burn easily.\n4. Remove the grinder components and chilled meat from the freezer. Set the grinder up on the stand mixer with a half pan underneath to catch the meat.\n5. Insert the coarse die (8mm) and run the machine on level 2 one time letting the ground meat fall into the pan.\n   1. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bowl is super cold. However, if you\u2019d like to run the meat through the grinder again for a finer grind, chill the ground meat and grinder for 10-20 mins, then have at it a second time.\n6. Pour cold water and vinegar into the bowl with the ground meat mixture and mix with paddle attachment until the meat and fat slightly emulsify, or with a food processor if you have one.\n7. Once mixed thoroughly, attach the appropriate sausage stuffer attachment. Load the grinder and hopper up with ground meat and run it on low speed until meat comes out the end. Once meat comes out the end, turn off the stuffer and slide on your pre-soaked hog casings.\n   1. Large stuffing tube for big casings, small for skinnier casings.\n8. Hog casing on the stuffer nozzle, and meat pushed to the end, tie off a knot on the casing and begin sausage stuffing process on low heat. Use one hand to plunge in the ground meat mixture and the other to finesse the sausage as it comes out the end.\n   1. We don\u2019t want any airholes in the sausage that could lead to bursting when tying or cooking.\n   2. Don\u2019t stuff the sausages too too much or they\u2019ll be hard to twist off.\n9. Once all meat has been sausage-ified, cut off any remaining hog casing. Use a needle or cake tester to prick small holes all over the sausage to release any air bubbles.\n   1. Save extra hog casing in a container packed with salt and refrigerate. They\u2019ll last for a long time. Up to 6 months I\u2019ve read.\n10. Cook right away, or leave uncovered in the fridge for casings to dry out and flavors to meld overnight. Your call.\n   1. Serve brats with a good bun, a bit of spicy mustard, and if feeling festive some homemade sauerkraut. Orrrrrr make beer braised brats by doing the following\u2026\n   2. Brats should last in the fridge for 4-5 days, or frozen for a couple months.\n\nTECHNIQUE FOR BEER BRAISED BRATS...\n\n1. Add a bit of oil to cast iron, brown brats and flip then remove from pan.\n2. Add sliced onions to pan. Season with salt. Cook onions over medium heat stirring until they\u2019re about 25% caramelized, 10 or so minutes minutes.\n3. Once caramelized add butter, garlic, black pepper, paprika, brown sugar. Stir until incorporated then add flour to the spiced onion mixture and stir in again. Cook for 1-2 more minutes. \n4. Once mixed, stir in dark beer (oktoberfest preferably). At this step you can also add optional mustard and sauerkraut. Mix the stock and beer into the seasoned onions and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes until slightly reduced.\n5. After 5 minutes the liquid should be slightly reduced, introduce brats back into the pan with the onion braising liquid and cook until the beer gravy is thick enough to your liking and brats are cooked to at least 165F or 74c. \n6. Optional parsley or fennel frond garnish\n7. Serve with more sauerkraut and mustard. Bun and mashed potatoes optional.\n\n**Easy Homemade Bratwurst & How to Cook Beer Brats**  \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "created_utc": 1600873436.0, "score": 35, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "html_title": ""}

There were holes in the bottom of the gourd uniform in size. (She had a wall where many different gourds were hanging that had holes of various sizes). Once the dough was in she held it over a bowl and patted on the dough until it was coming out of all of the holes then did a little swish with her wrist to cut off the flow before quickly moving it over a pot of boiling water. She was hitting the end of the handle with her wrist I believe to make the dough flow through the holes at an even rate. It made the most perfect looking noodles. \n\nI recently went looking for this again thinking it would be easy to find, but after 20 minutes of searching I've had no luck. Maybe my brain is fried and I just can't think of the perfect word combination to bring me the search result I'm looking for. So now here I am looking for someone else who has either seen this video and knows the correct terms for this type of cooking, has a link to the video, or really any information on this style! \n\nI just planted some giant bottle gourd seeds and was hoping to find out how to make the tool and a recipe for the noodles.

{"title": "How do I make Turkish Bread?", "selftext": "I've been wanting to make turkish bread but the more i researched it, it seemed that no one have been able to make the ideal turkish bread. [This is what](https://imgur.com/HIcdDbB) the end goal should look like, with keypoints being: soft, chewy and filled with airpockets. \n\nBut all of the recipes and videos I've seen they basically get a lesser quality of turkish bread, which resembles more a loaf of bread than turkish bread. Although fluffy, they don't seem as chewy, they are definitely more dense and they lack the big air pockets. Here are two examples of people who made [a 10 (picture)](https://imgur.com/q8N0CQF) and [20 minute video (picture)](https://imgur.com/hHezyE7) trying to replicate the turkish bread. They both conclude their experiment saying \"it's good enough\", but looking at the bread it's obvious that the is going to taste and feel much different than the real turkish bread.

{"title": "Make Your Own with price comparisons?", "selftext": "Hi all, I'm looking for your best \"make your own\" recipes with cost comparisons to box mixes. I recently found a recipe for make your own rice a roni but I was wondering how it breaks down compared to box mix for a dollar. Anyone have some copycat recipes with price comparisons? If no pricing I'd still like to see your best recipe, things I can prep ahead with dry ingredients and then just add wet ingredients when ready to make (kind of like jar cookie mixes but with real food sides or meal items). Thanks!\n\nEdited to add I already do a decent amount of scratch cooking - like pasta sauce, mac&cheese, homemade pizza...we also occasionally buy these things, too. Annie's mac & cheese (with coupons) is a great side dish or lunch option that tastes good and homemade mac & cheese is much tastier but that's something I would make as a dinner entree. My sister and I owned a bakery for a short time. We would cost out all of our recipes in order to figure out the prices. Homemade cookies (large size) of almost any variety (choc chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter) almost all worked out to between 15-22c per cookie. Homemade brownies worked out to be around 40c (for the large bakery size serving we made). Frosting - pennies compared to can frosting unless you get it on a really great sale. A bulk recipe for pizza dough = about 25c for a 16oz pizza dough. Our local stores sell it on average $2.39 and there's a monthly sale cycle at one store where you can get 10/$10. Even Walmart is $1.73 at rollback and I believe neither of these are a full 16oz dough. I think they are 13 oz. Anyway, yes I'm interested in replacing some of the processed stuff with homemade versions if possible as long as they are easy and not too expensive. Maybe this edit helps clarify what I'm looking for.

{"title": "Simple Brown Veal Stock (with How-to video)", "selftext": "What's up everyone,\n\nHave you ever wondered how to make homemade stock, or have you made your own in the past?\n\nHomemade stock is worlds better/cheaper than store-bought stuff. Keeping a freezer with homemade stock reserves on deck is a surefire way to elevate your cooking at home - think restaurant quality soups, braises, flavor-packed grain dishes or reduction sauces and more. \n\nStock making is a staple, straight-forward technique that every passionate cook should be familiar with (even if you're ballin' on a budget.) The written recipe and notes are listed below. However if you're more of a visual learner I recommend checking out the video here -[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrown veal stock is simply a liquid made by slowly simmering ingredients in water and extracting flavors into liquid form. Stock is a powerful flavor base that has a load of different functions in the kitchen. I don\u2019t know many things\u2026 but one thing that I do know for sure is that preparing your own stock with vegetables, animal bones, and aromatics will not only teach you an important lesson in the kitchen, but it will also elevate whatever you usually cook with the store-bought stuff. \n\nThere are many different types of stocks from brown to white, fish to veal, but today we\u2019re going to focus in on, what I feel, is the most delicious and kitchen-life-changing: brown veal stock. To call a stock, \u201cbrown\u201d simply means that the animal bones and vegetables are roasted/charred in a hot oven before they are simmered; also a tomato product such as tomato paste is generally added for acidity, sweetness, and color (though not always.) A \u201cwhite\u201d stock simply means that the stock ingredients are not roasted before they are simmered - no color, in most cases, means less flavor. So for the sake of running through a stock-making technique, I wanted to focus on one that achieves deep flavor - brown veal stock. \n\nI\u2019m going to explain my method below. But be sure to read the extra \u201cImportant Notes\u201d at the bottom of the page. Whatever I didn\u2019t cover in the method or video will be listed down there. Let\u2019s get to it... \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 10 lbs veal bones (try and find knuckle bones)   \n \n* 3 oz (\u00bd cup) grapeseed oil (or any high-heat, neutral cooking oil)   \n \n* 1 lbs onions (4-5 medium), I like to use yellow but use what\u2019s on hand   \n \n* 8 oz carrots (1.5 large), chopped with skin on   \n \n* 8 oz celery (4-6 stalks), chopped   \n \n* Tomato paste, 1 small can10 black peppercorns   \n \n* \u00bd bunch of parsley   \n \n* \u00bd bunch thyme   \n \n* 2-3 bay leaves   \n \n* 2-3 garlic cloves   \n \n* fresh water, to cover   \n \n* \u00bd cup dry red wine   \n \n\n**Method:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Start by rubbing the veal bones with grapeseed oil. Some people scoff at using oil, but I find that it helps the bones achieve solid browning. Plus if you do a good job skimming, it\u2019s easy to deal with.   \n \n2. Next, roast in a pre-heated 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C oven for 1 hour, or until they turn deep golden brown in color. Make sure to rotate the bones half way through to make sure things char evenly.   \n \n3. Meanwhile, prepare your Mirepoix like you did the bones, by rubbing the vegetables with oil. I don\u2019t like to peel my carrots or onions - the skin has a ton of flavor locked inside.   \n \n4. Once the time has passed, check on your bones, they should have some beautiful color. Remove them from the oven and rub with the tomato paste until covered, but not plastered on. You probably don\u2019t have to use the entire can of paste. Place the tomato covered bones back in oven for another 20-25 minutes until the tomato paste starts to caramelize.   \n \n5. To be efficient with your time, start roasting off your mirepoix with your tomato-smeared bones on a separate tray. Though they likely won\u2019t be finished at the same time as your bones, it\u2019s good to get things rolling.   \n \n6. Place bones in a large, heavy bottomed stockpot.   \n \n7. Place the tray used to roast our bones over the stove and heat over medium-high. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, or water and use a wooden spoon to scrape the crispy bits stuck to the tray. Technically these crispies are known as \u201cfond.\u201d Pour the wine and fond mixture into the stockpot with the bones.   \n \n8. By now, your mirepoix should be getting there. Once finished and charred, add the mirepoix to the stockpot.   \n \n9. Fill the stockpot with enough cold water to cover the bones by at least 2-3 inches. Using cold water encourages a clearer stock. If you don\u2019t care about the clarity, use warm or hot water. Just make sure the water you\u2019re using is high-quality and clean.   \n \n10. Once hot, add the peppercorns, parsley, thyme, garlic and bay leaf. Some people like to wrap these aromatics in cheese cloth with twine known as a \u201csachet\u201d, but I don\u2019t see a need to do so. We\u2019re going to strain everything out at the end, so it seems redundant to me. But if you want to wrap things up in a cute lil\u2019 bundle, please, be my guest.   \n \n11. Heat stock over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to low and maintain a slow simmer. Do not allow the stock to boil or it will emulsify the remaining fat from the bones and make things clouded. \\*See note for \u201cthe oven trick.\u201d   \n \n12. Simmer for 8-12 hours, skimming with a ladle as necessary. Skimming is VERY important and you can\u2019t forget to do it or else your stock will be a foggy, fatty, sloppy mess. To skim, simply dip a ladle in the stock and remove any built up protein particles, fat and other scum. I like to do this every hour at least once, but I might be a little obsessive. A cool hack that allows for easier skimming is to pull the stockpot halfway off the heat. The fat and scum will collect to one side in a cycle, making things easier to skim.   \n \n13. After the stock is finished, strain through a course strainer (\u201cchina cap\u201d) and then through a fine mesh strainer (\u201cchinois.\u201d) \\*See YouTube video for links to purchase the same gear I use in the video.   \n \n\n\\*\\*\\* If you don\u2019t plan to use the stock immediately, store in fridge for up to 5 days or freeze any leftover stock - it\u2019ll stay good for up to 3 months. I like to keep them in labeled deli containers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Important Notes:* \n\nSTOCK IS A FLAVOR BASE; stock is used to make other dishes and is often reduced down to concentrate flavor. This means that you shouldn\u2019t season it with salt at any step during the cooking process; also, refrain from using any strong/overpowering ingredients. Keep the stock pure so that flavors can be added as needed to create specific dishes/sauces - shoutout to all my people with commitment issues. \n\nBROTH vs. STOCK: Simply put, broth is made of meat and stock is made from bones. Broth is generally lighter whereas stock is rich and has more body (a heavier mouthfeel) due to the collagen in the bones which, throughout the cooking process, breaks down into gelatin. \n\nBONES. Speaking of collagen\u2026 I like to use knuckle bones for veal stock. Generally, knuckle bones have much more collagen ready to be unlocked into gelatin from within. Though I\u2019m not afraid to throw in some marrow bones and/or meat scraps in my stock pot along with the knuckle bones. When making poultry stock look for backs, wings and necks as these all contain a buttload of collagen, too. \n\n\u201cTHE OVEN TRICK\u201d - One way to keep your stove range free of clutter is to simmer stock in the oven. Simply set your oven to 200F (93c) and place your stock pot inside once all of your ingredients and water have been added. I\u2019ve made stock this way a few times, but there are pros and cons. A couple pros are that your kitchen has less clutter and your stove is free to cook other things on and you can leave the oven on through the night and simmer the stock for the 8-12 hours while you sleep. The cons are that it\u2019s sort of a pain in the ass to continuously move the stock pot from the oven to the stovetop to skim off the protein aggregates, fat and other scum. I typically make my stock the traditional way, on the stove, but the oven trick works, too. Play around with both techniques and see which you prefer. \n\nWHAT IS \u201cMIREPOIX?\u201d Mirepoix is just a fancy French word for a flavor base of carrots/celery and onion. The classic ratio is 2 parts onion: 1 part celery: 1 part carrots. A good rule of thumb is for every 5 pounds of bones, use 1 pound of mirepoix. \n\nUSE QUALITY WATER! If you live in a spot with hard water, or just bad water in general, use store-bought stuff either bottled or in the jug. Make sure to use cold water to start your stock if you want it to be clearer and less foggy - this won\u2019t affect the taste, however. \n\nAROMATICS. The aromatics that I like to use in my veal/beef stock include bay leaf, parsley, thyme, black peppercorns and garlic. The amount in which you use is all preference based. \n\n\u201cREDUCTION,\u201d is a technique used to reinforce flavor. Veal stock isn\u2019t always used as is, but is generally reduced by half with the addition of mirepoix and aromatics. This is done to concentrate flavor and provide a more viscous mouth feel (give the stock \u201cbody\u201d). Check out my \u201cEasy Pan Sauce\u201d video to see how I reduce veal stock into a yummy, complex steak sauce. \n\nWHITE STOCK vs. BROWN STOCK. To make a white veal stock, simply rinse the veal bones with cold water. Place the rinsed bones in your stockpot with cold water and bring to a simmer. After this blanching phase, pour off the water and keep the veal bones in the stockpot. Doing this will allow any protein particles and other scum to detach from the bones giving you a cleaner, more delicate stock. Once your bones are blanched, simply follow the steps in this recipe but skip over the pre-simmer roasting process for the animal bones and mirepoix. This same method can be used for poultry stocks, as well. Though, as I mentioned, I highly recommend making brown stock as they are MUCH MORE FLAVORFUL. If you\u2019re going to spend your hard earned cash on quality ingredients, wouldn\u2019t you want to conjure the tastiest stock?

{"title": "Need help working on Rillette de Canard", "selftext": "Hiya FromScratchers, I'm going to make a flockload of Rillettes de Canard this month but so far I haven't perfected the ultimate recipe. \n\n Here's what I've got so far:\n\n* Make Confit of duck using just legs of duck and goosefat\n* once cooled enough to handle separate the meat from the bones and skin\n* bones and skin go in a pot with a light chicken stock, sauteed onion and carrot, a couple cloves of garlic, cardemom, a tiny chili pepper, bay leaves, sweet soy sauce (Kecap manis) and a peaty whiskey. Set to simmer down to a jus (de Canard), at this point I play with the salt and pepper to get the flavoring right\n* Meat gets pulled and put in a pan with the jus added, on low heat, so that plenty of the liquid in the jus is vaporised and all the flavors get absorbed into the pulled duck\n* Once there is next to no liquid forming if you lightly press a fork onto the meat take off heat, put into jars, add a tiny amount of goosefat from the confit, stir, and the coat the top with goosefat so that it will form a protective layer when cooled.\n\nMy philosophy is that less is more, but a tiny amount of flavoring really brings out the bright duck flavors while muting any gameyness. Using whiskey instead of wine will take away some sourness while adding some woodsy earthyness which I feel compliments the duck well. The sweet soy, carrot and onions give a slight sweetness that just warms up the entire taste.\n\nIs there a dark horse I left out like star anise that really puts the REEE in Rillette, or did I already overdo it, as I am wont to?\n\nLastly: I've seen several recipes throw out the bones and skin and the juices without making it into a jus. This seems like throwing away the very soul of the dish or am I missing something here? Also, I'd love to make this using entire ducks to lower my cost but I have found it extremely difficult to get a hold of duck for less than the price of just the legs (about 8 euros per kilo in NL, Europe). Best I could find was chinese duck for 6/kg and I am unsure what that type of duck will do for the flavor profile.\n\nAny suggestions to help me find reasonably priced ducks/that one extra or missing ingredient?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/97brbw/need_help_working_on_rillette_de_canard/", "created_utc": 1534277764.0, "score": 11, "author": "rankurai", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/97brbw/need_help_working_on_rillette_de_canard/", "html_title": ""}

I've seen many recipes saying to keep it on the warm setting for 2 weeks while it slowly caramelizes, which is what I'm doing.

It's very hot outside, often getting to be above 100 degrees F.\n\nMy question is this: do I run the risk of botulism (or other foodborne microbes) growing? There's some condensation collecting on the inside of the rice cooker, which I don't think is a problem, and I haven't read anything about botulism risk in this procedure, but I just want to be sure.\n\nI'm about a week into the project so far (I'm actually out of town so I don't know how the heads are looking right now, but I'm checking in with my roommates).

{"title": "App to track you pantry / food inventory?", "selftext": "Hello /r/FromScratch ! I am a senior Computer Information Systems student and would love your help designing an app!  \n&nbsp;  \nThe basis of the app is to track the amount of food you have on hand and optionally, the price you paid for that food. I believe that this app could be extremely useful for making things from scratch because it would allow you to be at the store and know what you have already in the house. Potentially saving you money and allowing you to make more items from scratch. What I am looking for is your feedback in the form of a really quick survey about what you would like to see in an app like this. Or, if it even useful at all to you. (Any feedback is welcome!) I also encourage you to comment below, I will be very active with replying to any feedback, questions, etc. The survey is 100% anonymous, unless you enter your email for the mailing list.  \n&nbsp;  \n**If you're already interested, here is the survey:** https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvLGR6fAoJOo1FHG9v6hsXZjP4GBPTQ3liK3pibff9LpZwqQ/viewform  \nBelow is more information about the app and the philosophy behind it.  \n&nbsp;  \n**My philosophy for this apps progress:**\n\n&nbsp;  \n1) **Make your life better, not hinder it**. The first question that comes to people's mind is, \"How will I update my pantry of food?\" \n\nMy current ideas for this are:\n\n- Manually, as you eat the food subtract it from your inventory\n\n- As you add items to a shopping list the app prompts for an updated inventory quantity\n\n- When you scan a receipt in, it asks for updated quantities of matching receipts/inventory items\n\nIf you have an idea for this please feel free to comment here or add it to the survey!\n\n&nbsp;  \n2) **Design.** I will be sticking to the full slate of design standards for the operating system that the app is on. Whether that be Android, iOS, or desktop, my goal is to make this app look appealing and seamless ad well as efficient.\n\n&nbsp;  \n3) **No ads. No pay walls for main features**. I am not going into this app looking for money. I am trying to solve a problem that I have in my everyday life (more on that later.) I would rather have a beautifully designed app that everyone uses for free rather than a beautifully designed app that no one uses because it costs too much money. Now, this isn't a guarantee that there won't be some kind of payment in the future. Servers do cost money (if the app ever needed them) but the core features of this app, tracking food inventory, will always be free to use, and ad-free.\n\n&nbsp;  \nIf this is something you're interested in please fill the survey out where you can input your email to get more information as it becomes available!\n\nThanks for your time!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "created_utc": 1487867741.0, "score": 26, "author": "klutch2013", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Request: Recipe help for making TROPICAL S'MORE MUESLI COOKIES", "selftext": " Hello /r/fromscratch,\n\nI have a rough list of ingredients for a Cookie i'd like to bake, though I must admit that i'm not much of a baker, nor do I really know how to go about completing the recipe. The intended outcome is a Muesli-based Oatmeal S'more Cookie with a tropical twist. The Muesli i'm using is \"Bob's Red Mill Brand - Old Country Style Muesli\", which contains dried Dates, and I would like to expound upon that exotic/tropical fruit flavor with a couple of the other listed ingredients. I'm really hoping to come out of this with a usable recipe including measurements of each ingredient, baking temp/time, etc. So here is my rough list of currently considered ingredients - (I understand that my list may be overkill or incomplete, so I am open to all constructive criticism and ideas.):\n\nReal Maple Syrup or Brown Sugar or Raw Honey or Molasses\n\nCrushed Graham Crackers\n\nMarshmallow Cream\n\nCinnamon and possibly a hint of Coffee\n\nBob's Red mill Old Country Style Muesli\n\nEgg\n\nBanana Flour\n\nUnsweetened \"Almond Breeze\" Milk in place of dairy Milk (this product is a 50/50 mix of Almond and Coconut Milk)\n\nReal vanilla Extract\n\nCoconut Oil (can it be used as a good substitute for Butter?)\n\nAnd ofcourse some form of Chocolate to complete the S'more aspect, be it Ghirardelli Semi-sweet Morsels, or maybe a ~60% Cacao Chocolate bar crushed into morsel sized chunks?\n\nBesides that, I am unsure of what else I may need. Baking Powder? etc.\n\nDoes this list of ingredients sound like it could be a winner in the right proportions? If so, how would you go about throwing together a recipe for this idea?\n\nThanks everyone\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/5syx5c/request_recipe_help_for_making_tropical_smore/", "created_utc": 1486630547.0, "score": 8, "author": "Mouthfood", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/5syx5c/request_recipe_help_for_making_tropical_smore/", "html_title": ""}

So, working with what I had: mexican rice, cheese, tortillas, and enchilada sauce, one knife, one fork, one cast iron skillet, I made this taco.   On a paper towel.\n\n#The Taco\n\nI poured in a thin coat of untoasted sesame oil into my skillet and gave the tortilla a little browning and char on each side.   Set aside tortilla, fry pre-cooked rice in the same oil, added enchilada sauce and cheese I cubed with the knife.   When the cheese was melted I put this mixtue on top of the tortilla shell.   Topped with organic cilantro and pico.\n\n\n#Mexican Rice, Microwaved\n\n\nI put 1/3 cup dry rice, 1/3 cup water and 1/3 cup pizza sauce I had made (just tomato sauce with italian seasoning) and 1 teaspoon of beef bouillon into a bowl, sprinkle liberally with cumin, cover with wax paper, then microwave for six minutes.   The rice was too dry at this point so I added a splash more water and microwaved again.\n\n\n#Enchilada Sauce\n\n\nThis is just (3 tablespoons flour/fat) a roux that you add a can tomato sauce to, a cup of beef broth, and a lot of chilli pepper to taste, and reduce until the desired consistency.   I like mine a bit thick.\n\n\n\n#The Pico\n\n\nI dice a medium tomato, dice a quarter of an onion, dice half a serrano pepper, dice a bunch of cillantro, add the juice of a lime, a couple turns of the sea salt grinder to taste, and distilled water to cover it.   The last step helps freshness and keeps the pico tasting less onion-y.\n\n\n#The Tortilla\n\n\nThese fresh hand made tortillas were actually store bought and were hiding in my freezer.

(You want the tomato mixture in the pot to be moist, but thick and gooey.)\n\nRemove the pot from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes or so.\n\nWorking in batches, put the tomatoe mixture through a food mill or press through a sturdy mesh strainer, collecting the sauce in a glass or plastic bowl.\n\nTaste the collected sauce and add salt and pepper to taste.\n\nIf you're using the sauce right away, simmer it for several minutes in a large saucepan before serving.

{"title": "Why is my pizza dough so inconsistent?", "selftext": "I have been making pizza for several  years at home and I usually use a recipe from cooks illustrated.  For the first year or two I used a food processor but then somehow or another we moved and lost it.  The food processor always seemed to do pretty well.  \n\nSo we ended up getting a top of the line kitchenaid mixer and I've had very inconsistent success with it.  Due to my understanding of how to manipulate the dough I can usually salvage it but basically the dough rarely forms a nice ball in the mixer.  Every once in a while it will form a nice ball with the EXACT same measurement, and temperature water and everything, then other times it's just a complete mess.  I end up having to add a half cup or more of flour to get it to ball up a bit.  When I pull the dough out of the mixer then it's SUPER sticky.  It's like super glue in my hands.  I then kneed it for a min or two on the counter and fold it on itself to form a ball then let is rise for several hours.  When it starts out super sticky like that the dough is often very weak after rising.  Like if i tried to toss it in the air the dough would just blow apart.  I have to be very careful with it on the counter and finesse it other wise holes rip very easily.\n\nSo what am I doing wrong?  Am i over kneeding the dough in the mixer?  Am I under kneeding?  Something just isn't right.  I see videos of people stretching their dough out like it's nothing and the dough just cooperates and doesn't rip holes and looks great.\n\nMy recipe is\n4 cups flour (I have best success with McAurther bread flour, unbleached)\n\n1-1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n2 table spoons olive oil\n\n2-1/4 teaspoon yeast\n\n1-3/4 cup water at 120F", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/2rbfdd/why_is_my_pizza_dough_so_inconsistent/", "created_utc": 1420395255.0, "score": 10, "author": "yARIC009", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/2rbfdd/why_is_my_pizza_dough_so_inconsistent/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I analysed the recipes for Five Spice Powder, and this is what I found [x-post from /r/recipes]", "selftext": "*Was told you guys would enjoy this so I hope you do!*\n\nFive Spice Powder is as famous a foreign ingredient can get, while remaining a complete mystery. Most people know what it is, but if you ask them the ingredients, you\u2019ll be greeted with many blank stares, or incomplete answers. The reason is simple, there is no fixed recipe.\n\nIn a way, Five Spice is a lot like what Curry Powder is for Indians. Ask any Indian household what curry powder is, and you\u2019ll be quickly told that there are many kinds of different curry powders to suit individual curries. Recipes also vary from house to house, city to city, and state to state! In this regard, Five Spice is very similar. Recipes vary from household to household and province to province. **In some special cases, such as in Sichuan Province, entire ingredients are different** (they prefer to substitute Fennel Seeds / Ginger for Sichuan Peppercorns)!\n\nBut what goes of the household brands that sell the blend in supermarkets? How do they cater to the masses? Upon even just the most basic investigation, we find that there is no consensus at all. Not only do recipes vary tremendously, but **often the most unexpected ingredients such as Cardamom and even cornflour (!) make an appearance**, most likely to save on cost. We also noticed that certain staple ingredients such as Cloves are normally missing, due to their high price. These tend to be substituted with ordinary cumin seeds, pepper, liquorice or other odd items. To add to the curiousness, many supermarkets in our local market of Hong Kong, didn\u2019t sell the blend at all!\n\n(See link below for photos of labels from existing products)\n\nMy next goal was to reproduce the ideal recipe, assuming cost was no issue. Although some sources on the web pointed towards True Cinnamon being used for Five Spice, this we quickly dismissed \u2013 China hasn\u2019t consumed True Cinnamon in large quantities ever, as they much prefer to their local flavour of the spice, Cassia. We quickly found that Star Anise, Cassia, Fennel Seeds and Cloves were essential ingredients for all Five Spice blends, regardless of where you were in China. The last ingredient varies by province to province.\n\nIn the Southern parts of China, Ginger root and Mandarin Orange Peel are often preferred, probably due to the fact that this is where they originate from. Other parts of China use Sichuan Peppers, Chinese Black Cardamom, and even Galangal. But we were on the journey for the most preferred taste. After countless taste tests, and more research, we landed on our target: Chinese Ginger Roots. The reason turned out to be much simpler than expected: **Ginger is one of the most popular ingredients in Chinese cooking, and also contributes a key flavour to the blend, not found in the other ingredients. Citrus.** Ginger is also extremely popular in other regions where Five Spice is used: Vietnam, Indonesia, and other Asian countries all make heavy use of Ginger in regular cooking.\n\n\n**The final recipe**\n\n- Star Anise (1 star)\n- Cassia (1-2 grams)\n- Cloves (1-2 grams)\n- Fennel Seeds (1-2 grams)\n- Ginger (1-2 grams)\n\nInstructions: Grind them all together. Use around 0.5g per dish.\n\nI know it varies, but these proportions mimic the Five Spice philosophy perfectly: personalise it!\n\n[Link to blog for photos of other ingredients labels, one even openly admitted it mixed in flour.](http://regencyspices.hk/spicetrade/2014/08/05/five-spice-powder-whats-real-recipe/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "created_utc": 1407254518.0, "score": 76, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "html_title": ""}

So we purchased the KitchenAid grain mill attachment for our KitchenAid mixer. It's a beautiful attachment, solidly built and looks ready to mill anything.\n\nUsing it for two days, I can safely say that it is not what we thought it would be. The grain is completely dry (we baked it in the oven for a whole day), but I am finding that it is just gumming up in the grinder and fear for the mixer motor since it turns and turns and barely anything comes out! We adjusted all the settings and did a larger grind with limited success, it would either pass through un-milled or not at all. I also think that the grain itself is too light and airy (compared to wheat berries). Anyone know of any other options? Our food processor doesn't get it fine enough and we don't want to run it through our coffee grinder. Anyone experience anything similar? Have any suggestions of what we could do? We usually just cut the whole grains in with regular flour but we were wanting a finer texture. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: Dry spent grains not grinding and gumming up KitchenAid Grain Mill attachment, other alternatives and/or mill's I should look into to make it into flour?\n\nUPDATE: We ended up hitting Bob's Red Mill up here in Portland and getting some real wheat berries and spelt berries and when we were milling them we'd cut it with a little (now very dry) spent grain and it would give it enough weight to grind it through.

{"title": "The sour cherry pie that science made", "selftext": "I made a sour cherry pie on Monday, and it may be the finest pie I have ever made, in my 30 years or so of pie making. Omg, it turned out so well!\n\nThis is the pie that science made, for sure. Tapioca starch is the best thickener for fruit pies, especially acidic fruits. But there is a very specific ratio of starch + sugar + water from the fruit that is then cooked to a specific temperature in order to achieve gelatinization. The resulting fruit has the perfect set, your pie slices hold together exactly so, but when you bite into it, you just get fruit, perfectly cooked. No starchy flavor, no gummy texture, just fruit, seemingly magically held together. Thanks, science!\n\nIn order to achieve those temps, this pie is baked for about an hour and fifteen minutes at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), which is quite a long time for pie. The pastry gets browned sometime around 45 minutes for the crust to an hour for the lattice. This is where pie shields or foil come in handy. You just cover the top strategically to prevent further browning.\n\nI also use science for the pastry. I used to use a classic French method that yielded incredible, flaky dough\u2026 sometimes. I got so frustrated with the inconsistency, I stopped making pastry altogether, for years. Then I came back to it as if I knew nothing, followed the science, tried several methods, and ultimately landed on adding alcohol to the pastry in order to inhibit gluten production. This makes for a flaky crust every time. And when made in a food processor and then rested in the fridge, the resulting dough is workable enough to be used for all kinds of sweet and savory pies, including weaving lattice crusts, etc, for hand pies, for blind baked pie shells (where this recipe really gets a chance to show off), it is a one size fits all dough, which is what I needed.\n\nFood is one of my special interests.

{"title": "Baja-style Fish Tacos: Recipe and History", "selftext": "Southern California is next in my quest to cook the signature dish of every American state. Thought this dish is surely Mexican, it has become Americanized in some aspects (depending where you go, of course) and is a top-seller on many Mexican-American menus.\n\nLegend has it Japanese sailors traveling to the Baja peninsula taught locals how to fry the fish with a tempura-like batter (something they learned from the Portuguese years prior). Not before long the crispy fried fish took on some Mexican flare from the locals and fish tacos quickly became a common on-the-go meal for fisherman and market workers. It wasn't until sometime in the 1980s did a San Diego based Mexican-American restauranteur popularize the taco by putting it on his menu. \n\nThe fish taco truly is a story of the intimate cultural connection between Mexico and the United States. If we take it a step further, perhaps a story of mid 20th century globalization between East and West (being Japan and Mexico). The rest is history.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for all the components of a classic SoCal, Baja-style fish taco. From Pico to Crema, it's all there. Let me know if you have any questions. Let me know if you'd like a link to the recipe video and I can shoot it over to you. I hope you like it!  \n\n\n**Fish Batter:**\n\n*This batter is inspired by The Fat Duck outside of London. The water in the alcohol evaporates quickly leaving us with a super wispy, crispy and light coating.*\n\n* 1 1/2 cup Self Rising Flour\n* 2 cups Rice Flour\n* 2 tsp Baking Powder\n* 2 Tbsp Honey\n* 1.5 cups Vodka\n* 2 cups Beer\n\n1. Mix the flour and baking soda in a large bowl. Dissolve the honey into the vodka then pour it into the flour mix. Add the beer and whisk together. Keep the batter cold in the fridge until needed.\n\n**Chili de Arbol Salsa:**\n\n*This \u201cSalsa\u201d is probably more like a hot sauce to the American palate. It\u2019s thin, vibrant red and very spicy.*\n\n* 1 Garlic clove, smashed\n* 1 cup Dried Chili de Arbol, stemmed\n* \u2153 cup Water\n* 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* Kosher Salt, to taste\n\n1. Snap the stems off of the chilies. Dry roast the chilis in a hot skillet until aromatic then add to a blender, do the same to the garlic.\n2. Blend the chilis and garlic until pulverized completely, then add the water, salt and vinegar and process again until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve over fish tacos.\n\n**Avocado Crema:**\n\n*This creamy sauce is a much needed cooling element to the taco. It\u2019s also good on sandwiches, eggs, etc.*\n\n* 2 avocados, pitted and peeled\n* 1 Garlic clove\n* \u00bd cup Mexican Crema\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt, more to taste\n* 3-4 Tbsp Lime juice, more to taste\n\n1. Blend everything in a food processor. If the crema is too thick, thin it down with more lime juice or water.\n\n**Pico de Gallo:**\n\n*This is everyone's favorite mild, refreshing salsa and it couldn\u2019t be easier to make.*\n\n* 3 tomato, diced and seeded\n* 1 white onion, diced\n* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped\n* 1-2 Jalapenos, finely chopped\n* 2 Tbsp Lime Juice, more to taste\n* Kosher salt, to taste\n\n**To Build the Tacos\u2026**\n\n1. Double up the tortillas, lay in the fish followed by a drizzle of the arbol salsa, the slaw, the pico and the avocado crema. Serve with a cold, crisp cerveza and crush!\n\n**P.S.** Any white saltwater fish works great for fish tacos.

{"title": "Chimichangas from Arizona (Deep Fried Burritos)", "selftext": "Legend has it, the famous Arizonan Chimichanga was accidentally discovered by a Mexican-American mother. One day, in a rush to get food on the table to feed her small family, the woman added too much oil to the pan before frying her pre-rolled burritos. The burritos were deep-fried instead of shallow fried leaving her a crispy, crunchy, fully fried end result that would later be coined the \"chimichanga.\"\n\nIt may be a legend, sure. I mean there's no real historical proof that the discovery of the dish went down that way. Regardless of fact, it's a fun story that describes an awesome treat-of-a-dish. I started doing some research into the definition of American food by creating a video series on YouTube called \"Cooking the States.\" As you might imagine (and probably already know) the Southwestern states are HUGELY influenced by our neighbors down south; Mexico and the American Southwest have intimate cultural ties and food is no exception.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for Chimichangas aka Deep Fried Burritos. I made everything from scratch including the flour tortillas which, if you haven't tried homemade flour tortillas are well worth the time - they're supremely chewy and flavorful. The filling is just shredded beef and cheese while the other \"fillings\" that you might expect in a burrito are more like \"toppings.\" Anyways, I'll leave my recipe below and, if you want to cook-along, a video to go along with it. Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjAWxIXHbVg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam). Cheers!\n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n* 3-4 pound Beef Chuck Roast\n* 3 dried Guajillo Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Ancho Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Chipotle Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 4 Garlic Cloves\n* 4 cups Beef Stock\n* 1/2 cup Tomato Puree\n* 1 tsp ground Allspice\n* 1 tsp dried Oregano\n* 3 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar\n* 2 tsp Kosher Salt\n* 1 stick of Cinnamon\n* 3 Bay Leaves\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n* 680g All-purpose Flour\n* 100g Lard\n* 7g Kosher Salt\n* 360g Water, warm (about 90F)\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n* Flour Tortillas (from recipe)\n* Beef Barbacoa (from recipe)\n* 8 ounces Colby Cheese, cut into batons\n* 8 ounces Monterey Jack Cheese, cut into batons\n* Neutral Oil for frying\n\n**To serve...**\n\n* Romaine Lettuce, shredded\n* Black olives, sliced thin\n* Tomato, seeded and diced\n* Avocado, sliced thin\n* Mexican Crema\n* Lime Wedges\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 250F.\n2. Bring the stock up to a boil then turn off the heat, and pour the stock into a blender. Add the torn chiles and garlic then cover. Let the mixture steep for 15-20 minutes, or until the chiles have softened.\n3. Add the red wine vinegar, dried oregano, cinnamon, allspice and tomato puree. Blitz into a thin puree. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or vinegar if need be.\n4. In a large dutch oven over high heat, sear the beef chuck until richly brown and caramelized then pour over the chili braising liquid from the blender. Add the cinnamon stick and bay leaves then braise the beef.\n5. If using a regular pot or dutch oven braise with the lid on, for 2-3 hours, or until you can easily shred the meat with a fork. If using a pressure cooker, cover the braise and place over a burner over high heat. Allow the braise to rise up to full pressure, then lower the heat to medium and hold the braise at high pressure for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cut the heat and carefully release the pressure with a wooden spoon.\n6. Remove the beef from the pot and let cool slightly. Take the beef out of the braising liquid and shred it with a fork then set it aside. Optionally do this step ahead and let the beef rest in the braising liquid overnight for more flavor, but make sure the beef is drained before folding burritos.\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n1. In a large bowl, work the fat into the flour with your fingers until incorporated like pie dough. Make a well in the center of the bowl. Dissolve salt into the water then pour it into the well and work it into the flour by hand. Work the dough until it comes together, then dump it onto the counter and knead until smooth.\n2. Divide the dough into 6 portions, set them covered on a plate and let rest for 30 minutes.\n3. With flour as needed, roll out the little balls to 14 inches with a rolling pin. Heat a large, wide, ungreased pan or tray over medium heat and cook the tortillas for 20-30 seconds, flip and repeat on the other side. Don\u2019t overcook the tortillas or they\u2019ll become crispy.\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n1. Lay a flour tortilla on a clean work surface and spoon in some beef strained barbacoa followed by a piece of Colby and Monterey cheese, top with more beef. Wrap the burrito tightly into a flat rectangular shape similar to a pizza pocket, secure with wooden toothpicks, then set it on a baking sheet while you roll the remaining burritos.\n2. Bring the oil to 375F and fry the burritos, two-three at a time, until crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oil, let rest while you fry the remaining burritos and fry a second time for an extra crispy Chimichanga. Drain the finished burritos on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n3. Serve with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, black olives and a zigzag of fresh Mexican crema.

{"title": "I recreated a Banh Mi from my favorite Vietnamese bakery in Chicago.", "selftext": "Colonization is not tight, however in the case of Vietnam, a food-history-curious guy, such as myself, cannot overlook the cross-cultural delicacies French occupation brought to the country. Without the co-mingling of the Vietnamese and French people, we likely wouldn\u2019t have pho or banh mi. Crazy.\n\nThere's the delicate crunch and ultimate fluffiness from the Vietnamese baguette (much different than the French variety), a super flavorful main filling (in our case gorgeous Lemongrass chicken), crunchy aromatic vegetables and tangy, semi-sweet pickles AND NOT TO MENTION the rich, depth from a well-made pate.\n\nAll of the ingredients and technique are listed below. I also posted a how-to video if you prefer visuals. Let me know if you have any questions!\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Ingredients:\n\n500g Bread Flour\n\n5g Instant Yeast\n\n4g Sugar\n\n8g Kosher Salt\n\n345g Cold Water\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Technique:\n\n1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the bread flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt until homogenized. Pour in the cold water and mix with the paddle attachment for 1 minute. Replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook and knead for 10-20 minutes, until the dough passes the stretch test.\n2. Remove the dough from the mixer, shape it into a ball. Plop the dough into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest until doubled in size for 30 minutes to an hour.\n3. Grease your hands, then dump the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly greased work surface. Shape the dough into a large, 1 inch thick puck. Cut the dough like a pizza into 4 equal wedge-shaped triangular pieces like a pizza (280g each).\n4. Flatten the dough by hand, then roll from the top point down to the base of the triangle. Roll and press the dough down by the ends making sure to keep the middle fatter than the ends. Pinch the ends to seal, then continue rolling until smooth.\n5. Transfer the shaped baguettes to a baking tray lined with parchment, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes to an hour until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 500F, make sure it\u2019s preheated for at least 30 minutes before baking.\n6. Spray the baguettes with water, then make a long, deep slash running the length of the baguette. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. At the 12 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water, then close the oven. At the 9 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water again, rotate the baking sheets, then close the oven. At the 6 minute mark, spray again, then finally with 3 minutes remaining spray a final time. You will have baked a total of 15 minutes, and sprayed the baguettes 5 times. Be liberal with the water.\n7. Remove the baguettes from the oven and let cool completely on the baking sheets. The resulting loaf should be light, crispy, moist and cottony on the inside.\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Ingredients:\n\n1/2 pound Chicken Liver\n\n1/2 Yellow Onion, sliced thin\n\n1 Garlic clove, peeled and smashed\n\n1 tsp Chinese 5-Spice Powder\n\n1/2 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n1/2 cup Water\n\n1 1/2 sticks Unsalted Butter, room temperature and cut into 1/2 inch cubes.\n\n2 tsp Shaoxing Cooking Wine\n\nGround Black Pepper TT\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Technique:\n\n1. Add the chicken livers, onion, garlic, salt and water to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the chicken livers are barely pink on the inside, 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool with the cover on for 5-10 minutes.\n2. Strain the mixture and add the chicken livers, onion and garlic to a food processor. Process the ingredients until pureed. Add the wine, 5 spice and a few cracks of black pepper and pur\u00e9e until smooth again. With the machine running, add the tempered butter one cube at a time until emulsified into the liver mixture.\n3. Transfer to ramekins or a sealable container and refrigerate until solid. Serve chilled and spread on Vietnamese baguettes.\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickles Ingredients:\n\n1 1/2 cups White Vinegar\n\n1 cup water\n\n1 tsp Salt\n\n1/2 cup Sugar\n\n1 pound Carrot, Ribbons\n\n1 pound Diakon, julienned\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickle Technique:\n\n1. Add the vinegar and water to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and salt until dissolved. Remove from heat and pour over the carrot and daikon. Store covered in the fridge for 1-2 weeks.\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Ingredients:\n\n1 pound Boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\n1 stalk lemongrass, peeled and chopped fine\n\n2 Garlic cloves, minced\n\n2 Tbsp Lime Juice\n\n2 Tbsp Fish sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Dark Brown Sugar\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Technique:\n\n1. Combine all the ingredients in a bag and let marinate in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n2. Remove chicken from the bag, pat dry, shake off veg chunks and sear in a pan with some oil on both sides. Add a dash of the marinade to the pan, cover and cook on the stovetop until finished.\n3. Let cool slightly, chop up into pieces, set aside for sandwich.\n\n## To build the final sandwich:\n\n1. Hollow out baguette, spread thin pate on top of baguette, then pile in some lemongrass chicken.\n2. Top with cucumber, daikon and carrot pickles, jalapeno and cilantro. Close sandwich and munch as is or cut it in half.\n\n## Example Workflow:\n\n1. Make bread, let rest 30 minutes to an hour or until doubled in size.\n2. While the bread rises, make marinade and let chicken marinate for at least an hour. Make chicken liver pate, let chill and solidify in fridge. Cut all vegetables (cucumber, jals, carrots, daikon), make pickling liquid for quick pickles and submerge carrots and daikon.\n3. Shape baguettes, let rest another 30 minutes to an hour on tray, or until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30 minutes.\n4. While the shaped bread proofs and the oven preheats, cook the marinated chicken, chop into pieces and set aside.\n5. Bake baguettes, remove from oven and let rest for 20 minutes before opening. Ready all other prepped ingredients to build the sandwich.\n6. Build sandwich. Remove chunk of insides of dough, add lemongrass chicken, cucumber, pickles, jals and cilantro. Spread pate on top, then close the sandwich. Optionally cut in half and MUNCH HARD.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The baguette recipe makes enough for 4 medium (or 2 large) baguettes.\n* As usual, I\u2019ve provided grams for the bread component of the sandwich for accuracy.\n* French Baguettes and Vietnamese baguettes are different.\n* Chinese 5-spice powder consists of star anise, fennel, Szechuan peppercorns, cinnamon and cloves. If you\u2019d like, you can make your own blend, but the mixture is widely available in many American grocery stores.\n* \u201cBread Improver\u201d is a chemical dough relaxant that allows bread to stay malleable without having to rest it as long or at all. I spoke with a few professional bakers who said that Bread Improver is not necessary and only helpful when baking on a commercial scale. I did a side by side comparison and I couldn\u2019t tell a difference in taste with or without the improver so\u2026 leave it out. There\u2019s no reason to worry about it here.\n\n**Watch the video here -** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ\\_oIh4AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ_oIh4AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "created_utc": 1646841276.0, "score": 102, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "pizza crust - I keep messing it up", "selftext": "apologies in advance if this is asked a million times.  just point me to that post and will read intently.\n\nSo here's the scoop - I have been attempting my own pizza crust for a while (think years).  I'd gotten it to about a \"meh, it tastes like pizza crust\" level, using bread flour.   If I do it on the weber grill it goes a little better, but still.. just ok.  So I got a \"kit\" at one point as a gift from Williams Sonoma   (pizza crust+ sauce),  did THAT on the weber and it was just freaking great.  As good a crust as I've ever had.  So I've gone down a hole trying to make a better pizza crust, and its just not working.  I can't get beyond 'meh'.\n\nI've tried '00' flour,  more expensive bread flour.  I've used a food processor, I've mixed by hand.  I've used purely metric measurements from youtube videos made by italians (as opposed to imperial or whatever we americans call what do our measuring with) .  If anything I just end up making it worse.    What is the magic I'm missing?\n\nHere's the process at this point:\n\nusing various flours (again either \"00\", bread etc.  I'm not mixing the flours together, just using different types).   Here's the basic recipe\n\n600ml water\n\n1kg  flour (edited)\n\n30g salt\n\n2g yeast\n\nI mix with my hands and end up kneading no more than 12 minutes (I timed it) .  The dough seems like it should be.  its in a ball and I press a dimple in it and it springs up.  I've even checked the temperature of the center of the big dough ball.\n\nlet the dough rest for about 2 hours,  make my dough balls, put a little olive oil around each one, put them in tupperware, and leave them alone for a day.\n\nI then take one, and roll it out  (I try to do the various hand methods but I and up with at least one super thin area, and or holes).   I get it to about 3/16 of an inch thick (4-5 mm).  meanwhile put my pizza stone in the oven (its on the cheapy side, but its well seasoned at this point), pre heat the oven on 420 (no there is no significance there.  honestly).  when the preheated beep goes off, I pull out the pizza stone, throw the dough on it,  quickly put sauce, cheese and toppings on, and into the oven for about 12 minutes.\n\nwhat I get is a very chewy crust. at 12 minutes,  it was also crunchy, and not in an appetizing way (too hard crunchy)  if I vary the length of time lower, still very chewy.\n\nI used to put olive oil on the stone and spread it around before I put the crust on it.  but haven't done that in a while.\n\nSo I'm screwing things up,  and I don't know where i'm going wrong to fix it.   help please.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/smcqsr/pizza_crust_i_keep_messing_it_up/", "created_utc": 1644194997.0, "score": 41, "author": "SoImaRedditUserNow", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/smcqsr/pizza_crust_i_keep_messing_it_up/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Shelf stable recipe request for micro studio life", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI've found a cheap apartment but I have no oven and only an induction cooktop and a \"white trash George foreman\" (waffle iron). I also have a mini fridge.\n\nI would like to know if you all have any suggestions for things I could make and put on the shelf in Mason jars.\n\nI do a bit of pickling. My method is to clean the jars, the whole cooking area and wipe everything down with lysol wipes except for the jars, those I rinse with a little vinegar. I'll take my clean veggies and chop them up, stuffing then into the jar. I then mix my brine and bring it to a boil and put it over the veggies, filling the jar. Thermal contraction still keeps the seal tight and the few remaining bacteria will soon be denatured by hot vinegar. The pickles are nice and crunchy and I win.\n\nI intend to make a jar of kraut with my next pickle batch and other than various pickled veggies and kraut I don't know what else to prepare that keeps on a shelf in a jar. I'm not big on jellies and jams and I do love spicy food.\n\nI make a lot of hummus and blended lentil soups so the freezer gets full quickly. I'll gladly accept freezer food ideas but that's not really what I'm looking for.\n\n\nIf you have a favorite pickled Olive and mushroom recipe I'll give it a go. Feel free to share your best torshii combination. However I feel like \"pickled this and pickled that\" can't be the only answer here, or maybe it is?\n\nI'm just trying to save money and have bright, happy, tasty food.\n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/sb0aq5/shelf_stable_recipe_request_for_micro_studio_life/", "created_utc": 1642962713.0, "score": 43, "author": "No_Finger2852", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/sb0aq5/shelf_stable_recipe_request_for_micro_studio_life/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I made Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen entirely from the ground up... (recipe included)", "selftext": "I'm lucky enough to live in the same city as arguably one of the best ramen chefs in the western world - Mike Satinover aka the \"Ramen\\_Lord\"  author of the \"[Book of Ramen](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLPoLxek3WLQJDtU6i3300_0nNioqeYXi7vESrtNvjQ/edit?usp=sharing).\". Mike was nice enough to take a couple of my calls and let me pick his brain about the soup, noodles, toppings, and everything in between.\n\nRamen from scratch is no simple feat. It takes time, waiting and some know-how... but don't worry the last part comes with trial and error (I didn't know JACK before I started toying with the soup/noodle techniques.) What lays before you is my interpretation of a shoyu ramen. I did my best to make it easier for the home cook - using common kitchen measurements (cups, tbsp, tsp, etc.) when possible and distilling down some complicated techniques into simple step processes. Big shoutout to Ramen\\_Lord and Way of Ramen for all the dope free information you guys provide to the masses, you two are doing the Ramen Gods work (go peep them on Instagram and YouTube.)\n\n*Almost all ramen includes 5 components*. Below you'll find the recipe organized into categories - *the noodles, soup, tare (flavor base), aromatic oil, and additional toppings*. I hope this recipe inspires you to learn more about ramen, or at the very least builds more confidence in the kitchen. Let me know if you have any questions below and COOK AWN! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc Adam\n\nNoodles: \"Easy Ramen Noodles\"\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 500g Bread Flour\n* 200g Water\n* 2g Sodium Carbonate\n* 5g Salt\n\n\\*This recipe requires a pasta machine. I use [this model](https://amzn.to/3kifsHK).\n\n\\*\\* Like most dough/bread recipes, this requires precision. I find that a [kitchen scale](https://amzn.to/3wyntgt) it necessary here to achieve consistent results.\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Stir salt and sodium carbonate into water until dissolved.\n2. Add the flour to a large bowl and incrementally, slowly pour the salted water over the flour while mixing. The mix should resemble a shaggy, crumbly mess that holds together when squeezed but falls apart when lightly massaged again. Add the dough to a ziplock bag and rest for 30 minutes.\n3. Put the ziplock bag filled with dough in another larger bag and step on the dough to create a flat sheet of dough about half an inch thick. Let the dough rest for 30 more minutes.\n4. Remove the dough from the bag, I use scissors to cut the bag as to not break the dough sheet, but I'm clumsy so you might not have to. Roll the dough sheet out until it\u2019s about 1/4 inch thick then slice it in half so it can be fed and rolled through the pasta machine.\n5. Feed one dough sheet through the \u201c0\u201d setting on the pasta machine a couple times, then fold it in half and feed it through the \u201c2\u201d setting open-end-side first. This lamination step will help align the gluten in one direction through the entire noodles which helps with texture and makes the eating experience more pleasurable.\n6. Roll the dough out one number at a time until you reach the \u201c5\u201d or \"6\" setting; 5 for thicker noodles, 6 for thinner. Once the dough is rolled out it will be long so cut the sheets into two sections. Attach the noodle cutter then feed in one sheet using your hand to keep the dough sheet flat and avoid any kinking. You may need to periodically hit the noodle sheets with a light dusting of corn or potato starch, but I've found it isn't always necessary with this dough.\n7. Lightly massage a bit of corn or potato starch into the finished noodles, portion out (100g portions), and store in a lightly starch-dusted lidded container in the fridge for 1 day before using. They'll last a couple days in the fridge, or up to 6 months in the freezer if wrapped tightly.\n8. Cook the noodles in boiling water for 2 minutes before immediately transferring to a bowl of piping hot ramen broth (see broth recipe below).\n\n\\* Optionally, dust the noodle portions in corn or potato starch and squeeze them in your hand to make wavy noodles.\n\n\\* Homemade Sodium Carbonate: Bake 100g Baking Soda on foiled baking sheet and bake at 250F for 1 hour. You\u2019ll lose about 1/3 the weight of your baking soda . Sodium carbonate gives the noodles a chewy, stretchy profile which is critical for making proper ramen noodles - don't skip it.\n\nSoup: \"Tonkotsu Soup\" by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4.5 lb Pork Neck Bones\n* 4.5 lb Pork Femur Bones or Ham Hocks\n* 25 Cups Water\n* 1 Onion, halved\n* 10 Garlic Cloves, peeled\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting broth is whiter in appearance).\n2. When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. The scum goes through several phases here, you\u2019ll know when the scum is pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white broth, don\u2019t skip it, and don\u2019t end it prematurely.\n3. Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid\\*.\\*\n4. Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices.\u00a0\n5. Add the now clean bones to a pot and add 6 L of water.\n6. Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.\n7. In the last hour, add aromatics to the broth and bump the heat up to medium-high.\n8. Strain the soup.\n9. To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won\u2019t be as strong.\u00a0\n10. Reserve the soup as needed.\n\nTare: \"Standard Shoyu Tare\" adapted from Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups Soy Sauce\n* 2 (4x3 inch) strips Kombu\n* 1/4 cup Mirin\n* 1/4 cup Sake\n* 7-8 medium Dried Anchovies (\"Niboshi\")\n* 2 cups Katsuobushi, loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, kombu, dried anchovies and sake in container then place in the fridge and let sit overnight.\n2. The next day, heat the mixture just until it\u2019s about to simmer. The tare should be steaming but not bubbling. Hold it at this stage for 10 minutes.\n3. Remove the kombu. Whisk in the brown sugar until it\u2019s dissolved then add the katsuabushi. Hold at just under a simmer for 10 more minutes.\n4. Strain the tare, store in the fridge as needed. It will last for 6 months in a covered container.\n\nAromatic Oil: Scallion \"Negi\" Oil by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* One bunch scallion whites, trimmed to their ends\n* 1/2 cup Neutral Oil\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Add oil and scallions to a small saucepan.\n2. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 10-15 minutes or until the scallions cook to a golden brown.\n3. Remove from the heat, strain the oil into a heat-proof container and store until needed.\n\n\\* The crispy scallions also make a topping for a sandwich or eggs.\n\nAdditional Toppings: Soy Egg, Chashu Pork, Menma, Scallions\n\n**Chashu Pork Ingredients:**\n\n* Pork Shoulder or Pork Belly, tied if needed\n* 1/2 cup Shoyu\n* 1/2 cup Water\n* 1 cup Sake\n* 1 cup Mirin\n* 1/2 Tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 onion, halved\n* 4 garlic cloves, smashed\n* 3 inch knob ginger, sliced\n* 1 tsp salt\n* Pepper TT\n\nChashu Pork Technique:\n\n1. Add all ingredients to a large heavy bottomed bot with a lid. Braise on 300F (149c) for 2-3 hours, or until the pork is easily pierced with a fork.\n2. Let the pork cool in the cooking liquid overnight.\n3. The next day remove the pork from the pot and slice into portions. Optionally, broil the pork or torch it for color.\n\n**Marinated Egg Ingredients:**\n\n* 1/3 cup Water\n* 1/3 cup Mirin\n* 1/3 cup Soy Sauce\n\n**Marinated Egg Technique:**\n\n1. Mix all ingredients in a cup, add eggs. Let marinade for 6-8 hours, then remove from brine and store in covered container. Leaving the eggs in the brine too long makes them VERY salty, so be aware of that.\n\n**Scallions, sliced thin**\n\n* Grab a bunch of scallions, slice them as thin as you can, reserve for serving.\n\n**Menma**\n\n* This is marinated, fermented bamboo shoot. I buy these from my asian market, but you can order them online [here](https://amzn.to/3D3ZgB8).\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Remove toppings from the fridge to temper so they aren't cold, (soy eggs, menma, chashu, etc.)\n2. Bring the soup to a simmer and begin boiling water for the noodles to cook.\n3. When the noodle cooking water is boiling, drop the noodles.\n4. While the noodles cook add the tare, aroma oil and hot broth to a warm serving bowl.\n5. Shake excess water off the noodles then transfer them to the serving bowl. Adjust noodles with chopsticks if you want.\n6. Add additional toppings and TAKE A RIDE TO MUNCHVILLE!\n\nExample Workflow:\n\nDay 0: Soak pork bones in large non-reactive container. Plastic or glass is best. This removes some impurities and blood found in the bones.\n\nDay 1: Start stock - clean bones/skim scum, start soaking tare, make scallion oil, make noodles.\n\nDay 2: Finish stock - add aromatics, strain and emulsify, simmer tare - add katsuabushi/sugar, braise/cool chashu, boil eggs.\n\nDay 3: prepare for serving (see instructions below).\n\n**P.S.

Nothing fancy, just some fundamental knife skills. Figured you all might want to see it too.\n\n[Check it out here if interested.](https://youtu.be/NOO77T5omu0)\n\n**Tomatoes**\n\n* Lay the tomato stem side down\n* Make Slices down and as close to the bottom as possible without cutting through it\n* Rotate the tomato 90 degrees and repeat step 2\n* Lay the tomato on it's side such that the stem is facing the wall\n* Cut downward to dice the tomato up\n* Once you get to the end, it should only be a slice of tomato left. Cut it into chucks as desired\n\n**Cucumbers**\n\n* Slice  \n\n   * Lay the cucumber down and slice downward, make sure\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Angle either the knife or the cucumber at 45 degrees and slice downward. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Half Moon  \n\n   * Split the cucumber along its length, then slice normally. This is good for when you want to slices to be smaller to match other ingredients in the dish\n* Diagonal Half Moon  \n\n   * Same as the regular half moon, just angle the knife or the cucumber\n* Quarters  \n\n   * Split the cumber in half lengthwise like for the half moon, then lengthwise again to quarter it\n   * Slice as normal\n* Deseed  \n\n   * Slice lengthwise just like you do for the quarters\n   * Lay the cucumber spears with the seeds facing up\n   * Lay the knife parallel to the ground and slice across the cucumber, cutting out the seed pods\n* Julienne/matchsticks  \n\n   * Deseeded  \n\n      * Lay the deseeded cucumber spears with the deseeded side down, this is because it's a flatter and more stable surface - making it safer\n      * Slice into matchsticks\n   * Regular  \n\n      * Cut the cucumber into long cylinders\n      * Lay the cylinder on the cut side up so it's a tube sticking straight up, then slice downward into planks\n      * Stack the planks on top of each other and slice into matchsticks\n\n**Celery**\n\n* Cube/Chunk  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Cut into chunks of desired size  \n\n      * If you want, you can cut the celery in half lengthwise, then make the cuts for a smaller dice\n      * These cuts are good for mirepoix, sofrito, Louisiana Holy Trinity, and other veggie bases\n* Slice  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on\n   * Angle the knife or the celery at 45 degrees and cut. This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Julienne  \n\n   * Divide the celery into halves, thirds, or quarters depending on desired matchstick length\n   * Lay the Celery down so that the fiber strings are facing the ceiling, this is a more stable surface and thus safer to cut on.\n   * Turn the celery so that it's length runs parallel to the wall/perpendicular to you\n   * Slice celery into desired julienne/matchstick length\n\n**Peppers**\n\n* Julienne/Matchstick  \n\n   * Top and tail the pepper - ie cut off the top and bottom\n   * Lay the pepper upright and make a downward cut to open up the pepper\n   * Lay it on its side and unroll the pepper\n   * Cut out the seed pod and remove any wayward seeds\n   * Slice the rolled out pepper into julienne/matchsticks sizes as desired\n* Dice  \n\n   * Line up the julienne/matchsticks and cut into desired dice size\n\n**Cabbage**\n\n* Slices/strips  \n\n   * Cut the cabbage into quarters as it's large size is unwieldy\n   * Make a V-Cut to remove the core. It's thicker than the leaves and thus cooks differently\n   * Lay the Cabbage so that the exposed core is facing the opposite wall\n   * Slice the cabbage into strips. BE CAREFUL as you get closer to the base as it's less stable there. So slower is better there\n\n**Carrots**\n\n* Roll Cut  \n\n   * This is a special cut because it makes a unique shape AND you can tailor the size of the cut pieces to match each other and thus get even cooking\n   * Cut a chunk out at a 45 degree angle.\n   * Rotate the carrot 180 degrees and make another 45 degree angle cut\n   * Repeat these cuts, but change the length of the cut so that each piece has roughly the same thickness\n* Slice  \n\n   * Cut a THIN sliver down the length of the carrot and lay the carrot on this new cut side down. This alleviates the round shape of the carrot and makes a stable and safer base to cut on\n   * Slice as desired\n* Diagonal Slice  \n\n   * Repeat the thin sliver cut above\n   * Cut at desired angle\n* Dice  \n\n   * Cut the carrot into sections (halves, thirds, etc) then cut those sections into planks of equal size\n   * Stack up the planks and cut into spears of the same thickness\n   * Line up the spear are cut into dice of desired size\n* Long Julienne  \n\n   * Cut the carrot into planks as detailed above\n   * Stack planks and cut into juliennes of desired length and width\n* Short Julienne  \n\n   * Make the Diagonal slices detailed above, but on a HEAVY bias\n   * Stack up the slices and cut into matchsticks\n\nLet me know if there are other vegetables you want to know how to cut!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/ocfvek/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables_for/", "created_utc": 1625249768.0, "score": 10, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/ocfvek/tutorial_on_how_to_cut_some_basic_vegetables_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Ketchup made from the ground up... (not too sweet)", "selftext": "Ketchup and I have a complicated relationship. While other kids slathered their hotdogs, burgers and french fries with ketchup, I much preferred hot sauce or... just plain fried I guess. I viewed ketchup as a neon red sugar paste that has no place on anything one intends to put in their mouth. That is, until my early 20s when I tried some homemade ketchup from a local burger spot that blew my mind; it was tangy, salty, and umami with just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the whole deal. Never before did I know that ketchup could... not suck. Trust me, it might sound contrary, but I'm not a food elitist, I pretty much eat anything so forgive me when I say that most store-bought ketchup is... subpar.\n\nThe recipe and technique listed below is my attempt at recreating the homemade ketchup that turned me onto ketchup. I've decided to use San Marzano tomatoes because they're high quality, widely available all over the place, and always stay \"in season.\" If using fresh tomatoes, wait until summer or the ketchup isn't going to be too good. I've also included a video to those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions in the comments!\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 (28oz) cans San Marzano tomatoes, crushed\n* 1 cup Water\n* 1 cup White Vinegar\n* \u2154 cup Sugar\n* 2 tsp salt + more TT\n* 1 tsp MSG\n* 1 tsp Worcestershire\n* 1/2 tsp onion powder\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n* 1 tsp Fish Sauce + more TT\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Technique:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 300F.\n2. Pour tomatoes, water, sugar, salt, onion powder and garlic powder into the dutch oven. Break the tomato up with a wooden spoon.\n3. Place the dutch oven in the oven for 3-4 hours, or until reduced by about 2/3 and almost dry. Sometime at the 1.5 hour mark, stir the mixture making sure to push down any toasty tomato stuck to the sides of the pot.\n4. Add all the ingredients to a blender, and puree until a smooth mixture forms. Pass the puree through a fine mesh sieve to catch any seeds. Transfer to a sealable container and cool.\n5. Once cool, adjust seasoning and add fish sauce. Fish sauce is SALTY, if the finished ketchup needs more salt, keep in mind that the fish sauce will help with that. You should add enough that you get a certain umami from the fish sauce, but cannot fully taste or smell it - if you can taste it, you\u2019ve added too much.\n\n\\* *A Note about Xanthan Gum (XG):* Xanthan Gum is a hydrocolloid meaning that it thickens, strengthens and can sometimes smooth out purees and emulsions. I chose not to add it into the ketchup in this video because it seemed like an extra step. If using, puree the ketchup, pass it through a strainer, then reintroduce the ketchup to the blender and when pureeing add a bump of XG to the mix. Not too much, only 1/8th of a tablespoon or so will get you where you need to be.\n\n\\*\\* Wait until the ketchup is cooled before seasoning with salt. Cold food needs more salt, and if you season it while still hot, you could under season the ketchup. \n\n**Umami-LOADED Ketchup From Scratch** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "created_utc": 1625061802.0, "score": 66, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Why you shouldn't Crowd your Pan, and How to Always Get Golden Brown Food", "selftext": "Hi r/fromscratch. Here's a culinary quick tip write up on how to get that golden brown (Maillard Reactions) deliciousness on your food. Super helpful for any cut of meat, especially more economical ones like chicken thighs, beef round, pork loin chops, etc. Also made a vid to show what I'm talking about.\n\n[Take a look here if interested.](https://youtu.be/6tfvAVP480w)\n\nThe whole reason we want Maillard Reactions/Browning is because of the crust/crispy like texture it provides and because it\u2019s a series of Reactions that we find more flavorful than plain grey meat. It DOES NOT lock in the juices, that is a myth. You can get a perfect golden brown sear on any meat then let it sit for a bit. After 5 minutes the surface of it will be wet from the juices inside of it. Therefore we aren\u2019t sealing in anything. It\u2019s the texture and flavor compounds that we want.\n\nIn order to get that golden brown crust on any food, it needs to reach a certain temperature. Upwards of 310F/154C. If you crowd the pan with food, then the moisture released will be much greater from that increased amount of food. This causes water to pool in the pan because it cannot evaporate out fast enough. Water in liquid form cannot get above 212F/100C, which is far below the temperature we need for the Maillard Reaction (good browning). So instead of searing, we end up boiling/steaming the meat and while it does cook this way, it will not get that Maillard Reaction browning we\u2019re aiming for.\n\nIn a non crowded pan, the water can evaporate because there\u2019s less of it and thus we can get to those high temperatures we need to good Maillard Browning. Below is a side by side comparison, non crowded on the left and crowded on the right. Notice the difference in color between the two. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifbo3afd2b371.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5dc624d68fa1a87d10db07904095134a27152d8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/nse5dl/why_you_shouldnt_crowd_your_pan_and_how_to_always/", "created_utc": 1622837103.0, "score": 142, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/nse5dl/why_you_shouldnt_crowd_your_pan_and_how_to_always/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Your own Chicago-Style Giardiniera (Italian Pickle Condiment)", "selftext": "Giardiniera are spicy, pickled Italian vegetables. It comes in chunkier small diced form, or my personal favorite Giardiniera relish. Giardiniera is magical on pizza, sandwiches, burgers and, of course, absolutely crucial for any respectable Italian Beef sandwich.\n\nGiardiniera is a lifestyle here in Chicago and it took me until I was 12 years old to realize that it a Chicago thing. I was out of town and walked up to a server at a pizza restaurant asking for some and she looked at me crooked like a confused pooch. I was sad. But you don't have to be sad because no matter where you reside, you can make it at home. It takes a few days, but it's pretty easy and once you make a batch you'll be good for weeks, probably even months - yes, it keeps for a long time.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe, the technique and a video to go along with it all. I hope it helps. If you have any questions, let me know in the comment section here. Good luck!\n\n**Giardiniera Ingredients\u2026**\n\n*Giardiniera Veg:*\n\n* Half head of Cauliflower (260g), large dice\n* 4 Celery stalks (250g), large dice\n* 3 Carrots (270g), large dice \n* 12 Serrano Peppers (100g), seeds removed, large dice\n* 1 cup Green Olives (140g), pitted\n\n*8% Salt Brine (Day 1):*\n\n(Weight of water + veg) \\* (.08) = Salt Weight\n\n\\*\\*\\*Example Weight for Salt Brine:\n\nWeight of Veg with water just to cover - 2000g\n\n2000 \\* .08 = 160g\n\n*Pickling Liquid (Day 2-5):*\n\n* Water (half weight of Salt Brine)\n* Distilled White Vinegar (half weight of Salt Brine)\n* 3 tbsp Dried Thyme (9g)\n* 3 tbsp Dried Oregano (9g)\n* 1 tbsp Chili flakes (5g)\n* 6 Garlic cloves (30g), whole /peeled\n\nTECHNIQUE...\n\n1. Cut the veg into similar sized pieces. Fill just to cover with water. Record the weight of the water and veg, and add 8% kosher salt by weight. Set out a room temperature for one day.\n2. The next day, place a large bowl on a scale and zero it out. Drain the salty brine into the bowl, record the weight then discard the salty brine. To a medium sauce pan, add 50% of the weight of the liquid in water and the other 50% in white distilled vinegar. Add the spices and garlic to the pickling liquid, bring to a light boil and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3. Pour the pickling liquid over the veg, let cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. Let sit for 3 days before using.\n4. On day 3, strain the pickling liquid. Add the veg to a food processor and pulse to make a minced, \u201crelish-like\u201d, consistency. The giardiniera will last for a while in the fridge, at least 2-3 months.\n\nHOMEMADE Chicago-Style Giardiniera (Italian Pickle Condiment) - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Yf2GRlLQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Yf2GRlLQ4)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/nljfue/your_own_chicagostyle_giardiniera_italian_pickle/", "created_utc": 1622042131.0, "score": 58, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/nljfue/your_own_chicagostyle_giardiniera_italian_pickle/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Homemade Mustard from Scratch (3 Ways)", "selftext": "I never thought for a second to make homemade Dijon mustard, however now that I have a few pounds of corned beef on my hands I decided to do a deep dive into the world of mustards. What I came up on were dozens of recipes for dozens of different types of mustard. What was left after the mental distillation process were these 3 mustards: a refined and smooth \"Dijon-style\" mustard, a whole grain sweeter mustard made with beer, and a classic \"English\" style mustard made with yellow mustard powder. Each of these mustards has a time and place and I recommend giving them all a go! Below you'll find the recipes and techniques for each, plus a technique video for those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck!\n\n**French \u201cDijon\u201d Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 3/4 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/4 cup Dry White Wine\n* 2 tbsp White Wine Vinegar\n* 1-3 tbsp Water\n* 2 tsp Salt\n* 2 tsp Sugar\n\n1. Soak seeds overnight in enough water to cover.\n2. Drain seeds, place in mortar and pestle. Mash until the yellow seeds come out of the husks. This will take some time (about 10 mins.)\n3. Once you really begin to see the yellow seeds, slowly start incorporating the wine.\n4. Once all the wine is in, add the salt and sugar then slowly incorporate the vinegar. Grind until the mixture becomes fine.\n5. Once fine, adjust seasoning. Adding sweetness (sugar) will cut the bitterness, adding acid (vinegar/wine) will reduce the \u201cheat.\u201d\n6. Pass the mixture through a fine mesh sieve using the back of a spoon. Optionally, pass it through twice for a super smooth, yellow Dijon mustard.\n7. Store and refrigerate the mustard for a couple days before using. Doing so will allow the mustard to \u201cmature\u201d and reduce its heat.\n\n**English Style Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 1/2 cup Mustard Powder (Colman\u2019s Brand) \\*loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Water\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Sugar \n* 1/2 tsp Salt\n\n1. Whisk all ingredients together. Let stand for 15 minutes to thicken. Serve immediately. Seal and refrigerate to store.\n\n**Whole Grain Mustard (Beer Mustard)...**\n\n* 1/4 cup Yellow Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 cup Beer, divided\n* 5 tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 tsp Salt\n\n1. Soak the seeds with the vinegar and 1/ 2 cup of beer. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\n2. In a small sauce pan, mix the remaining 1/ 2 cup of beer with the sugar, salt and turmeric. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from the stove and let cool to room temperature.\n3. Into a blender, pour the mustard seeds and the soaking liquid and the beer syrup mixture. Pulse until smooth-ish, then place in a container and wait a few days before using for the same reason as Dijon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/m20w0v/homemade_mustard_from_scratch_3_ways/", "created_utc": 1615392348.0, "score": 17, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/m20w0v/homemade_mustard_from_scratch_3_ways/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Home-Cured Corned Beef (for St. Patrick's Day)", "selftext": "When I think of corned beef the first thing I think of is a corned beef deli sandwich. Rye bread stacked high with corned beef, some grainy mustard and melted cheese... it's a glorious thing. Not until this year did I ever question how corned beef was made, but I'm glad I did. It turns out that making corned beef at home is pretty easy, all it takes is a bit of simple math and some patience.\n\nAfter some testing, I've come up on what I believe to be a pretty decent spice blend, cure ratio and end result and I'm stoked to share it with you all. Below you'll find the measurements and technique to make your own corned beef, from the ground up. For my visual people, I've also included a link to a cook-along video. Let me know if you have any questions here in the comments, I'm happy to help if I can. Good luck.\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 8-10 lb Beef Brisket \u201cflat\u201d, trimmed\n* Curing Salts (see below)\n* Corned Beef Spice Blend:\n* 3/ 4 cup Coriander (60g)\n* 3/ 4 cup Black Pepper (100g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Caraway Seed (25g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Brown Mustard Seed (50g)\n* 1/ 3 cup Star Anise (30g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Whole Mace (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Clove (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Allspice Berries (10g)\n* 2 tbsp Juniper Berry (10g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Chili Flake (15g)\n* 5 Fresh Bay Leaves (2 dry)\n* 1 Cinnamon stick (2.5g)\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\n1. Weight out spices, toast over low heat, then transfer to a mortar and pestle to crush. Remove half of the spice blend and set aside until we\u2019re ready to cook.\n2. Fill large container with water, take the waters weight, then add 5% salt and 3% brown sugar to it. Then add half the spice blend and stir until mixed well. Finally, add brisket and submerge. Use a ceramic bowl or non-reactive, food-safe thing to weigh the brisket down. Cover and label. Let sit in the fridge for 7-10 days, flipping the meat and stirring once daily.\n3. After 7-10 days remove corned beef from brine, rinse under running water. Discard brine. \n4. Place the brisket in a large pot, and pour in enough water to cover by a couple inches. Blanch meat for 5-10 minutes and skim off the scum that rises to the top.\n5. Once most of the scum is gone, add the remaining spice mix, crushed garlic and ginger then bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook, covered for 3-4 hours or until the brisket is fork tender. \n6. Towards the end, around hour 3 of the cooking process, add in red potatoes, carrots and cabbage then cover and simmer until tender, about 30-45 minutes.\n7. If the veggies finish cooking before the brisket, remove them and set aside until ready to serve.\n8. Once the beef is easily pierce-able with a knife, remove it from the pot and set it out on a sheet tray to cool slightly. \n9. Slice corned beef against the grain, on the bias. Serve with grainy mustard or mustard vinaigrette, the boiled vegetables from earlier, and dark beer.\n\n**TO MEASURE SALTS AND SUGAR...**\n\n* 5% Kosher Salt (of water weight) =\n   * (.05) \\* Water Weight in grams = Kosher Salt needed\n* 3% Brown Sugar (of water weight) =\n   * (.03) \\* Water Weight in grams = Sugar needed\n* Pink Salt should equal .50% of the total weight of the meat\u2026\n   * My brisket = 8lb = 3624g\u2026\n   * ...pink salt (.005)\\*3624 = 18.12g\n\n***How to Make Home-Cured Corned Beef -*** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc\\_IVKvddPM&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc_IVKvddPM&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "created_utc": 1614795698.0, "score": 23, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Cassoulet - A simple guide to a not-so-simple dish...", "selftext": "Cassoulet is a complex meat and bean stew from the Southwest of France. Some believe Cassoulet to date back to the dark ages and others claim its actually ancient. Traditionally, it's made by loading a \"cassoul\" or clay casserole dish with many types of pork and duck, then topped with beans and cooked using a technique that leaves the upper beans crisp and the insides soft and unctuous. \n\nI spent the past week planning and gathering ingredients to make the famed French \"Cassoulet\" entirely from scratch. I wanted to challenge myself and indeed was it a challenge, but a fun one at that.\n\nI broke down a duck to confit the legs, I made fresh Toulouse sausage by hand, I simmered the beans with homemade ham that I brined and smoked and of course sourced the \"Tarbais\" beans from a specialty food website. All in all, a ton of work and effort went into making this cassoulet and I'm super amped to be able to share my recipe with you. Below you will find the ingredients for each component and it's technique. I also made a video on how to make the Cassoulet and all of its components if you'd rather watch than read. I hope this one finds you well and that, even if you cut some corners to save time, you give it a go!\n\n***FULL CASSOULET INGREDIENTS\u2026***\n\n**For the Beans...**\n\n* 2.5 pounds White Beans (1kg)\n* 1 Yellow Onion (375g)\n* 1 Carrot (56g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Tomato Paste (28g)\n* 3 medium Tomatoes (528g)\n* 5 Garlic cloves (15g)\n* 6-8 cups Chicken Stock (plus 2-3 cups more for later)\n* 2/ 3 lb Pork Belly (300g)\n* 1/ 2 lb Ham\n* 3 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Duck Fat (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Salt (35g)\n\n**For the Herb Sachet in the Beans...**\n\n* Small Bundle Fresh thyme (5g)\n* Small Bundle Fresh Parsley (9g)\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 1 tsp Black Peppercorn (3g)\n* 1 tsp Juniper Berries(2g)\n* 4 cloves (.5g)\n\n**Additional Meat for the final Cassoulet\u2026**\n\n* 4-5 Pork Spare Ribs (400g)\n* 3 six inch Toulouse Sausage Links(400g)\n* Bundle of Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 2 tbsp Duck Fat (30ml)\n\n**Duck Confit\u2026** \n\n* 4-6 Duck Legs\n* Duck Fat to submerge legs\n* Thyme (fresh, picked and pressed in)\n* Zest from half an Orange\n* 6 Garlic Cloves (1 per leg)\n* Salt (about a half teaspoon per leg)\n* Cracked Black Pepper TT\n\n**Toulouse Sausage\u2026 (recipe yields 5 lb or 15-20 links)**\n\n* 3.5 pounds Pork Shoulder (1.6 kg)\n* 1.5 pounds Fatback (680g)\n* 3/4 cup White Wine (175ml)\n* 1/4 cup Brandy (60ml)\n* 3 tablespoons Kosher salt (40g)\n* 3 tablespoons minced garlic (50g, 15-20 cloves)\n* 1 tablespoons ground black pepper 8g\n* 1 tablespoon ground white pepper 8g\n* 1 teaspoon Nutmeg, freshly grated (optional)\n* 10-12 feet Natural Hog Casings (32-38mm)\n\n\\*serve with additional red wine vinegar and a nice bottle of light red wine.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nToulouse Sausage...\n\n1. Cut up pork belly and back fat into small-medium pieces manageable for the grinder. Toss the meat in the pepper, garlic, nutmeg and salt and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. Begin soaking the hog casings in a small bowl of cold water, set aside.\n2. Grind the mixture through a \u201cchunky\u201d (8mm) die and onto a sheet tray.\n3. Once all the meat is ground, add it to the bowl of the stand mixer and, with the paddle attachment on, mix the meat on low for a minute. After a minute, add the wine and brandy, then increase the speed to medium and mix for a minute or two longer. The liquid should be completely incorporated and the meat should look sticky.\n4. Optionally, fry up a bit of the meat and taste test it for seasoning.\n5. Set up the sausage stuffer on the stand mixer and stuff the ground meat into the hog casings.\n6. Tie off one end of the hog casing. Use one hand to help the casing off of the nozzle, and the other to guide the sausage onto the sheet tray.\n7. After stuffing, if forming links, poke holes in the sausage coil to make sure it doesn\u2019t burst while twisting. To form links, twist the sausage every 6-7 inches. If serving to a crowd, you can also leave the whole sausage in a coil and cook the sausage as is.\n8. Cook the sausage to an internal temperature of 160F, serve however you damn well please. Son. \n\nDuck Confit\u2026\n\n1. The day before cooking, season the duck legs liberally with salt and press the aromatics into the legs. Cover the tray with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days.\n2. The next day, remove the duck legs from the tray and rinse under cold running water. Do your best to remove all the salt and aromatics, then pat dry.\n3. Place the duck legs in a container taller than it is wide, submerge the legs in the duck fat, cook on 200F (93c) for 6 hours, or until their tender.\n   1. At first the legs will float, but as they cook and release water and air, they will sink to the bottom.\n   2. At first the cooking fat will be cloudy, when the legs are nearly done the fat will be clear.\n   3. If cooking the confit sous vide, season the legs with salt (not too much compared to conventional confit), then pack in your aromatics and cook sous vide for 185F (85c) for 6-8 hours for a \u201cshreddy\u201d classic confit consistency. Then chill down, in the bag, in an ice bath. Store in the fridge before using.\n4. Remove the duck legs from the oven and let them cool to room temperature in the fat. Once cooled to room temperature, if you intend to keep them in the fridge for a while, keep them in the fat to let their flavor develop. If you plan to use sooner, you can store them in a plastic bag or air-tight container. \n5. To prepare the confit, pour some fat onto a sheet tray, place the legs on and roast, skin side up, on 350F for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed. The crisp under the broiler for a couple minutes.\n\nCassoulet Beans\u2026\n\n1. Cover Beans with a few inches of water, and set aside to soak overnight. The next day rinse and drain, then set aside.\n2. In a large dutch oven, pad the bottom of the pot with the pork belly and cured ham (prevents the beans from sticking) then cover with the chicken stock. The beans should be covered by at least an inch or two of stock.\n3. Add the onion, carrot, tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic cloves, red wine vinegar, duck fat, and the herb sachet (thyme, parsley, bay, cloves, peppercorns, juniper berries).\n4. Cook gently on medium heat for an hour to an hour and a half, or until the beans are just tender. You want the beans to stop cooking just as they begin turning tender to avoid overcooking into mush.\n5. Once the beans are tender, remove the pot from the heat. Remove and discard all of the aromatic vegetables and herb sachet. Set the pork belly and cured ham aside for later use. Cover the beans up and let them hang out in their juices until we need them later.\n\nTo assemble the Cassoulet\u2026\n\n1. Start by roasting the toulouse sausage and pork ribs. Place the ribs and sausage in a pan and brown with duck fat and thyme. Once browned, deglaze the pan with water and add the jus to the bean cooking liquid. Set the meat aside for later.Place the pork ribs and sausage in a large roasting tray. Add a branch of thyme, a bay leaf, and 5 garlic cloves, and a drizzle of duck fat and oil. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the meat has some coloring.\n2. Place all the meats at the bottom of the pot.Optionally shred up a confit leg and add it to the mix. Use a slotted spoon, or something similar to spoon the beans, without the liquid, over the meat. Once the pot is layered and filled Use the bean cooking liquid to fill the dutch oven to the top of the beans.\n3. Bake in a 400F oven for 1 and a half hours. Check the beans twice, every 30 minutes to push the crust down and add a bit more bean cooking liquid (or chicken stock if you ran out). This remoistening process is going to allow the cassoulet to get very crispy without totally burning.\n4. During the last 15 minutes of cooking, about an hour and fifteen minutes into the process, put the confit duck on a sheet tray and add to the oven. With the cassoulet. Remove the cassoulet, then broil the duck confit until the skin is crispy then add it to the top of the finished cassoulet.\n5. Remove cassoulet from oven, serve with a bit of red wine vinegar (a condiment that helps cut through the richness and ease digestion.)\n\n*Example Workflow...*\n\nDay 1 - Break down duck, render fat, begin Cure for Duck Legs, Make Toulouse sausage.\n\nDay 2- Remove duck from cure, confit duck. Soak Beans.\n\nDay 3 - Finish crisping confit, roast meats, Cook Beans\u2026 finish cassoulet.\n\n**How to Make Cassoulet ENTIRELY FROM SCRATCH -** [https://youtu.be/HQR9yKGsPGc](https://youtu.be/HQR9yKGsPGc)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/lrgdvz/cassoulet_a_simple_guide_to_a_notsosimple_dish/", "created_utc": 1614182936.0, "score": 55, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/lrgdvz/cassoulet_a_simple_guide_to_a_notsosimple_dish/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Homemade Lasagna with Bolognese", "selftext": "Lasagna is a classic dish that can tell you a lot about a cook. There are dozens of ways to make the Italian classic... from utilizing different pasta types to adding all sorts of vegetables, or simply opting for a ragu of sorts and cheese. Making lasagna from scratch calls to a cooks ability to make a decent ragu (meat sauce), make homemade pasta sheets, and, if one opts for it, getting creative with the way the \"casserole\" is layered.\n\nBelow is my adaptation on a \"classic\" lasagna. If you want to have a whack at making it, I've left the technique and measurement list (in both weights and Imperial). I'll also go ahead and link to a video that I created for those of you who prefer something visual. I spent a lot of time on this, so I hope it helps you save some of your own! Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck!\n\n**RECIPE** (Serves 8...)\n\nFor Lasagna\u2026\n\n* 5.5 cups (200g) Parmigiano Reggiano\n* 1.5 cups (80g) Low-Moisture, full-fat Mozzarella\n* Fresh Basil and/or Parsley TT - garnish\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n* 4 cups (510g) Type \u201c00\u201d Flour\n* 4 (230g) Whole Eggs\n* 5 (90g) Egg Yolks\n\nBechamel (\u201cbesciamella\u201d)\u2026\n\n* 2 tbsp (30g) Butter\n* 3 tbsp (30g) Flour\n* 2 cups (474ml) Whole Milk\n* 1 cup (25g) Parmigiano Reggiano, grated\n* Ground Nutmeg TT\n* Salt & Pepper TT\n\nItalian Sausage Ragu \u201cBolognese\u201d...\n\n(Makes 10-12 servings)\n\n* 4 tbsp (60g) Butter\n* 1lb (454g) Italian Pork Sausage\n* 1lb (454g) Ground Beef Chuck\n* 1 large Onion/ 1.5 cups (320g)\n* 3 large Ribs Celery/ 1 cup (100g)\n* 2 large Carrots/ 1 cup (125g)\n* 5 cloves of garlic, minced (8g)\n* 28oz can San Marzano tomatoes (828ml)\n* 1.5 cups White Wine (355ml)\n* 2 cups Whole Milk (474ml)\n* 2 cups Veal or Beef Stock (474ml)\n* Herb Sachet - Fresh Thyme, Oregano, Bay leaf\n* Chili Flakes TT\n* Fish Sauce TT\n* (optional) Rinds from Parmigiano Reggiano TT\n\nTT= to taste\n\n\\*This recipe makes more Ragu than you\u2019re going to need for the lasagna. The ragu freezes well and will stay fresh for 3-5 months in the freezer.\n\n\\*\\*You could end up with extra pasta sheets, too. It\u2019s better to have some left over, then to be short on sheets. If you have leftover, cut the sheets into any shape you want and chill in an air-tight container. Boom. Fresh pasta for later in the week.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n1. Make a mound with the flour and use your fingers to create a well.\n2. Drop the whole eggs and egg yolks in the middle, whisk with a fork, and slowly begin collapsing in flour into the beaten egg and egg yolk mixture.\n3. Once the eggs have been worked into the flour, drop the fork and begin kneading by hand.\n4. Knead for 5-10 minutes, or until the dough is smoothed out.  \n\n   1. Add in a sprinkle or two of water if the dough is looking a bit dry.\n5. Wrap in plastic and set aside. Let rest for 30 minutes.  \n\n   1. Allowing the dough the time to rest will make it more supple, and easier to work with. If you don\u2019t let it rest, it will remain hard to roll out and pull back on you.\n6. Flour a sheet tray heavily and set it aside at the ready.\n7. After 30 minutes remove the plastic from the pasta and portion out into 4 quarters.\n8. Grab one quarter from the bunch, and cover the remaining pasta chunks with the plastic wrap so that they don\u2019t dry out.\n9. Form the pasta chunk into a 5-6 inch circle, dust with flour, then run the dough through the pasta machine starting at width 0.\n10. After the first pass, fold the two ends over each other, and run it through again. Repeat one or two more times.\n11. One the sheet is flat and even, increase the pasta machine width to setting 1, flour the dough again, then run the dough through. Repeat this process working your way up to setting 6.\n12. You should be able to see the silhouette of your hand through the dough.\n13. Skimping on flouring the pasta dough as you run it through the machine could lead you to torn pasta sheets. Flour is important.\n14. Place the WELL FLOURED pasta sheets back onto a sheet tray as you work.\n15. Once the pasta sheet are rolled out, portion the sheets into 13 inch long pieces (big enough to fit in your cooking vessel), flour, and set aside again.\n16. Cook the sheets in well-seasoned water for 30-45 seconds, or until just cooked but still al dente.\n17. As the sheets finish cooking, place them on the rack and sprinkle with oil to avoid sticking and overlap.\n18. Do this step lastly, right before you\u2019re ready to build the lasagne.\n\nRagu Bolognese\u2026\n\n1. Form ground meat into sausage patties, season with salt, and brown in a dutch oven, Once browned, reserve on a plate.\n2. Drain a bit of the excess fat from the dutch oven, melt the butter then add in your carrots, celery, onion and garlic. Cook the veg down for 5-10 minutes.\n3. Add the reserved browned ground meat back into the dutch oven and crumble using the back of a wooden spoon or something similar.\n4. Once the veg and meat mixture is crumbled, deglaze the bottom of the pan with the white wine, scraping all the brown bits off the bottom of the dutch oven. Cook the mixture on high heat until the wine reduces by nearly half. 7-8 minutes.\n5. Once the wine is reduced, add the milk. Again, cook over high heat until the milk is near fully reduced, another 10 minutes or so.\n6. Once the mixture is almost dry, pour in the San Marzano tomatoes and veal stock and stir until combined.\n7. Finally, add in the herb sachet, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2-4 hours.  \n\n   1. The longer its simmered, the more flavorful it will be.\n8. After time simmering, optionally pulse the bolognese with an immersion blender to get a smooth yet textured consistency.  \n\n   1. The bolognese will be significantly reduced after simmering for so long. Feel free to add in more stock or water for a looser consistency. I prefer to leave mine reduced for a chunkier sauce.\n   2. Control the finally consistency of your ragu by pulsing it as much or as little as you like with an immersion blender.\n   3. The immersion blender allows texture control, but also helps emulsify some of the fat in the sauce into the liquid giving a gorgeous light orangish-brown color to the ragu.\n9. Once the desired consistency is achieved, season the sauce with fish sauce, salt, and pepper TT, put the lid on the dutch oven, and set aside.\n\nBechamel...\n\n1. Add butter and flour to a medium saucepan and cook for 5 minutes, or until the roux smells like pie crust - Chef John.\n2. Slowly whisk in COLD milk (no lumps), then grate in nutmeg, salt and pepper TT. Optionally add a bit of parm to the bechamel (technically making it into a mornay sauce.)\n3. Bring the mixture up to a boil, then cut the heat. When the Roux begins to bubble is when it\u2019s at its maximum thickening power. If your roux looks too thin, start over.\n4. Let cool for a few minutes, then lay some plastic wrap over the top of the bechamel and cover with a lid so a skin doesn\u2019t form, set it aside.\n\nTo assemble Lasagne\u2026\n\n1. Lay down a bit of bolognese and bechamel then the first layer of pasta.\n2. Lay down another layer of bolognese, bechamel, AND parmesan cheese. Finish with more pasta sheets to cover. Rinse and repeat.  \n\n   1. You should still be able to see the bottom pasta sheet once the bolognese is ladeled in, don\u2019t overdo the sauces in each layer.\n3. Finish the lasagne by pulling over two of the sheets to form a \u201cbowl\u201d then lay on the remaining bechamel sauce, a dollop of red sauce (mostly for color) and a little more parm.\n4. Cover with parchment paper, then tin foil and bake at 400F for 35 minutes.\n5. After 35 minutes, remove the parchment and foil, sprinkle on the mozzarella cheese and broil for 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and browned.\n6. Let rest for AT LEAST 30 minutes before slicing and serving.  \n\n   1. If you cut into the lasagne early, it\u2019ll still taste great\u2026 but you might get 3rd degree burns on the roof of your mouth and it could fall apart on you making all the layer work you just did worthless. Butttt it\u2019s your call, I won\u2019t get between a hungry human and a lasagne.\n7. Garnish with chopped parsley and basil.\n\n**A Guide to Homemade Lasagna (from scratch)** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "created_utc": 1611166989.0, "score": 22, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Split Pea Soup with Home-Cured Ham", "selftext": "Split pea soup is a popular way to use leftover ham for a good reason. It's chunky, rich and tasty. The smoke lent from a good leftover ham bone or fresh ham hock lends a smokey, porky taste that's hard to find in other vegetable-based soups. Split pea begins its journey in a solid state, with hard split peas and other lone ingredients scattered about, then over the long simmering process things change and the soup turns into the creamy, puree we all know and love.\n\nI made a giant ham from scratch a few weeks back so I was sitting on a leftover femur, aiche and shank bone... what better way to utilize the bones and leftover stew meat than making Split Pea Soup!? I ended up making a big batch of soup, saving some to eat throughout the week and freezing the rest for a quick dinner later in the month.\n\nBelow you'll find the ingredients and technique for my Split Pea Soup recipe. As usual, I'll also include a link to a video to those of you who prefer something visual. Feel free to sub out yellow split peas for green, and to use a fresh smoked ham hock or something similar if you don't have leftover ham bones in your freezer (likely the majority of you.) I hope this helps!\n\n**Split Pea Soup INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter (30g)\n* 1 Yellow Onion, diced (320g)\n* 5 Celery Stalks, diced (140g)\n* 4 Medium Carrots, peeled + diced (205g)\n* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced (8g)\n* 1/ 2 cup Dry Sherry Wine (125ml) \\*see note\n* 1 lb Dried Split Peas (454g)\n* 8 cups Chicken Stock (1893ml)\n* 2 cups Ham, shredded or diced (260g) \\*see note\n* 5 sprigs Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Fresh Bay Leaves\n* Ham Bones - femur, shank and aiche \\*see note\n\n*Salt + Pepper TT*\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n*\\*Feel free to use store-bought ham, or sub for fresh thick-cut bacon.*\n\n*\\*\\*Pork stock can be subbed for Chicken. Just make sure it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d stock and has plenty of collagen.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Sub Dry Sherry Wine for white wine, or Madeira wine.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Whole ham bones are optional, but do make a big difference in the soups flavor. Ask your butcher for leftover bones, or sub out for a smoked ham hock.*\n\n**Split Pea Soup Technique:**\n\n1. Start the ham bone. Roast the ham bone in a 500F oven until charred and roasty. About 10-15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.\n2. Add butter to dutch oven, season and sweat mirepoix and garlic until onions and celery are translucent. About 10 minutes.\n3. Deglaze dutch oven with wine, cook off the wine until the wine reduces by half. About 4 minutes.\n4. Add dried split peas to dutch oven along with thyme and bay leaves. Season with black pepper and mix.\n5. Add the chicken stock and roasted ham bones if using. Simmer the soup, uncovered for 1 hour and 45 mins.\n   1. Be careful when seasoning, the soup will reduce and the ham is already pretty salty.\n   2. Over time the split peas will fall apart giving the soup its classic, thick split pea look.\n6. Add the ham pieces and continue simmering for another 15 minutes.\n7. After two hours, remove the soup from the heat and let cool. Serve with creme fraiche, crusty bread, and more ham pieces if you\u2019re feeling like a big boy.\n8. Split pea soup can be kept in the fridge for 3 or 4 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.\n\n**Split Pea Soup (with Home-cured Ham) -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "created_utc": 1610556244.0, "score": 31, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Modern Cuisine at Home - Neopolitan Pizza Dough", "selftext": "I posted here about 5 or 6 months ago asking about pizza dough recipes. I was having a struggle with making my dough tender despite using a bread dough hook on my kitchenaid which should have made it nice and glutenous. I tried about 10 different recipes people sent to me and they were helpful, but I felt like they never quite reached the texture I wanted.\n\nMy family got me modern cuisine at home for my birthday and I have used it off and on with great success. However, the best thing it's given me so far is the nicest pizza dough ever. It's perfect chewiness and amazing flavor.\n\nI've been reading a food science book as well that has helped me learn that certain brands and certain types of materials matter in cooking. \n\nHere is the recipe I used. Hope you have a great outcome like me! I used weight for the flour as I find it more consistent.\n\n* 00 wheat flour (Antimo Caputo) - 500g or 3+3/4 cup\n* Room temp Water - 310g/mL or 1+1/2 cup\n* Pure Honey - 10g or 2 tsp\n* Salt (kosher diamond crystal) - 10g or 2+1/2 tsp\n* Vital Wheat Gluten (red mill) - 2.5g or 1+1/2 tsp\n* Active Dry Yeast (Antimo Caputo) - 2.5g or 3/4 tsp\n\nMix everything in a bowl (adding water last) using bread hook on medium for 5 minutes. Rest for 10 minutes at room temp and mix 5 more minutes. Cut into 2,3,4 smaller sections. Stretch for about 30 seconds and roll into nice round ball. Use grape seed oil to lightly oil a bowl, put the dough inside and flip over so both sides are oiled. Put a plastic wrap overtop and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or best off do it for 1 day. \n\nMake sure to take out 1 hour ahead of time. Heat up oven to 500 degrees and heat up pizza stone inside. Transfer pizza and cook for 4-8 minutes depending on size.\n\nEnjoy! As a note I used olive oil on the crust (Partana extra virgin).

{"title": "Home-Cured, Glazed and Smoked Whole Holiday Ham", "selftext": "Ham reminds me of cartoons from the 1950-60s. Those big ornate, steaming hams decorated with pineapple rings, cherries and cloves... definitely the food of yesterday. Then I got to thinking, why do I never see whole hams presented at the market or even at most well-stocked butchers? The fact is, people just don't make whole ham on the reg like they used to. Thus, marking the beginning of my quest to make a classic cured, glazed and smoked ham from scratch in my home kitchen.\n\nMy adventure started by researching all about curing and curing salts. I spoke with a handful of my chef friends and picked the mind of a great local butcher. Then I delved into making a yummy, holiday-y maple/dijon glaze and finally figured out how to turn my Weber kettle charcoal grill into a smoker.\n\nAfter a few weeks of planning and testing, I came up on some accurate brine/curing measurements and what I believe to be a sound technique and recipe to make a whole ham. I'm going to provide a picture, the technique and all of my measurements in the post below. I'm also going to provide a video for those of you who prefer something visual. We still have time before Christmas and New Years - this could be a fun project to undertake for the holidays! Good luck, let me know if you have any questions.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*My Cure/Brine Measurements\u2026*\n\n* *Total Ham Weight - 14.5lb (6578g)*\n* *Total Ham Weight (w/o bone) - 10.5lb (4762g)*\n* *Bone Weight - 3-4lb (1814g)*\n* *Water - 4qt (1 gallon) = 3800g \\* 3 = 11400g*\n* *5% Salt of water weight = 570g*\n* *3% Sugar of water weight = 342g*\n* Pink Salt (.25% of meat weight) - (4762g \\* .0025) = 11.92 \\~ 12g Pink Salt aka Prague Powder #1\n\n*\\*\\*\\*(Salt %* *x Water Weight = Total Kosher Salt weight)*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Use the same equation to calculate Total Sugar Weight*\n\n\\*\\*\\*I\u2019ve spoken to many amazing professional cooks and chefs, butchers about pink salt and everybody gave me a different answer in terms of how to use it. However one thing was constant - a little goes a long way. Too much of this stuff can be toxic, so take it easy. Less is more.\n\n*Maple-Dijon Ham Glaze\u2026*\n\n* 1 Cup Dark Brown Sugar\n* 1/ 2 Cup Dark Maple Syrup\n* 1/ 4 Cup Dijon Mustard\n* 1/ 4 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder\n* 1/ 2 Tsp Ground Clove\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n**Technique\u2026**\n\n1. Score ham.\n2. Weigh and record ham. Use weight of ham to then measure out .25% pink salt #1 and set aside.\n3. Take weight of large brining vessel and zero scale. Add the ham to the vessel and fill with water until the meat is submerged by a few inches. Remove the ham and record the weight of the water.\n4. Measure out 5% salt and 3% sugar by weight of the water.\n   1. This is a traditional gradient brine, not to be mistaken with an ultra precise equilibrium.\n5. Mix salt, sugar and pink salt into the cold water in the large vessel until dissolved.\n6. Place the ham on a large sheet tray and inject the meat a few times all over. Once injected, place the ham in the brine, cover and refrigerate.\n   1. The ham should brine at a rate of 2lb per day. So if you have a 15lb ham, keep it in the brine for about a week.\n7. Stir the brine on day 2, inject again on day 4, stir once more on day 5 then remove the ham from the brine on day 7.\n   1. Feel free to stir the brine every day if possible.\n8. Rinse the ham thoroughly under running water, then pat dry. Let the ham rest uncovered on a rack in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n   1. This stage will allow something called a pellicle to form, which will allow an outer crust to form when cooked and help the smoke adhere to the ham.\n9. Smoke the ham in a 200F smoker until the internal temp reads 130-140F.\n10. Meanwhile, make the glaze by mixing together glaze ingredients and cooking down until viscous.\n11. After 2 hours, brush the ham with glaze, then cover.\n12. After another hour or so, glaze the ham again and smoke until the internal temp hits 130-140F. Bring the ham back inside, glaze again, and finish cooking in a 250F oven until the internal temp hits 155F.\n13. If serving immediately, let rest for at least 45 minutes before carving.\n14. If cooking ahead, chill down the ham. The next day, carve the ham then set it on a tray to warm it in a very low oven. Once warmed through, plate pieces on a presentation platter and serve immediately.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "created_utc": 1608136994.0, "score": 40, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "html_title": ""}

By focusing on techniques that are shared across many different recipes, practicing a particular recipe meant they were getting better at making related recipes.\n\nI found this practice of breaking kitchen skills into small discrete units helped cooks quickly grasp what I was asking of them and greatly expedited the learning curve.

{"title": "Can someone help me shrink this recipe?", "selftext": "Let me start by saying I am not very experienced in the kitchen. I can cook, but I cannot create, if that makes sense. A friend of mine gave me a recipe for a spicy shrimp dish. It is a seasoning, shrimp, and buckwheat. The issue I am encountering is the buckwheat and seasoning are restaurant quantities, then its portioned out with individual servings of the shrimp. I want to resize the buckwheat/seasoning portions to make enough for **3-4 people** and not have a giant vat of the stuff left over. So can someone help me take these giant portions and shrink it down to a **family meal size**? If possible, explain how you shrank each serving, so I can apply the same method to a couple more recipes he gave me.\n\n**Seasoning:**\n\nGround Garlic: 850g\n\nOlive Oil: 1670g\n\nAchiote Paste: 110g\n\nChile Paste: 125g\n\nCitric Acid: 9g (or a substitute, i.e. lemon juice)\n\nCalabrese Peppers: 1700g\n\nKosher Salt: 20g\n\nSesame Seed: 125g\n\nCalabrese Pepper Oil: 425g\n\nDirections:\n\nMix olive oil and garlic in a pot.

While garlic and oil are cooking, mix calabrese pepper oil, citric acid, salt, achiote paste, and chile paste and process until it is fully mixed. Blend calabrese peppers until they become a puree and mix with the above ingredients. When garlic is done, add sesame seeds to garlic and cook for 5 minutes.

{"title": "Making Tofu with Fresh Soybeans", "selftext": "I love tofu. I know plenty of people out there who like to hate on it, but the fact is - Tofu is what you make it. The sauce, cooking technique and a number of other factors is what determines if the tofu is good or bad. One largely overlooked factor, in modern times at least, is the quality of the actual soybeans used to make the tofu and the tofu itself. Like any other protein or vegetable, there is a noticeable difference between good and bad tofu. I've been lucky enough to live near a market that sells super great, homemade tofu that I buy regularly. However, as of recent fall is in full effect and my local farmer's markets are beginning to close for the season... so I decided to have a whack at making my own soybean tofu, from scratch, at home and it turned out GREAT!\n\nTofu making is a super fun, different cooking project that is surprisingly simple and fairly inexpensive to make. Plus, like eating homemade pasta, there's something about eating tofu made by your own hands that is mega satisfying. I'm going to leave the recipe, technique directions and a short explainer video for my visual people below. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.\n\n*Tofu Ingredients:*\n\n* 310g Soaked Soybeans (2 cups)\n* 946ml Water (4 cups)\n* 15ml Liquid Nigari (1 tbsp), or other \"coagulant\"\n* 30ml Water for mixing Nigari (2 tbsp)\n\n*Tofu Technique:*\n\n1. Submerge 2 cups of soybeans in water and soak overnight. \\*This will yield more beans than you need for one portion from this recipe, but I like the \"insurance policy.\"\n2. Drain the soaked soybeans and add 2 cups of soaked soybeans to a blender along with 4 cups of water. Blend until smooth.\n3. Pour into sauce pan and bring up to a boil on medium heat, then reduce to simmer and simmer for 10 minutes. Skim the top foam.\n4. Pour the bean water mixture into a strainer lined with cheese cloth positioning a bowl underneath to catch the liquid. This liquid is our fresh soymilk.  \n\n   1. Squeeze the bean mash in the cheese cloth to fully drain it. Reserve this mash, it makes a great stew, but that's another recipe.\n5. Add 1 tbsp of liquid Nigari to 2 tbsp of water, mix and set aside.\n6. Pour the fresh soy milk in another sauce pan and over low-medium heat, bring it to 170F (76c).\n7. Once the tofu mixture hits 170F, cut the heat and gently add in half of the Nigari water mixture. Stir gently and pop the lid on. Let this sit for 5 minutes, then repeat the process with the remaining nigari mixture.\n8. By now the curd should be separated from the whey. Pour the mixture into a tofu mold lined with cheesecloth, put a weight on top, and let the press the tofu to your desired firmness. The longer the press, the firmer the tofu.  \n\n   1. A good starting place is 5 minutes for soft tofu, 7 for medium and 10+ minutes for anything firm.\n9. Store the pressed tofu in cold water and let chill for at least 30 minutes before eating. This will help tighten things up and give it a nice texture, even if you prefer your tofu on the softer side.\n10. Use immediately, or store in water, refrdgerated for 4 or 5 days.\n\n**Making Tofu from Scratch with Fresh Soybeans -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2\\_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "created_utc": 1603294694.0, "score": 35, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Recreating Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza at Home from Dough to Sausage...", "selftext": "I'm from Chicago. Around these parts 2 pizza styles reign - Tavern Style thin crust, and the infamous Deep Dish pizza (which many argue is more like a casserole.) Though I find myself surrounded with deep dish joints and a number of great deep dish options, I wanted to have a whack at making it myself, from scratch, at home.\n\nBelow is are my measurements/weights and recipe for what I believe to be a pretty solid technique for making domestic deep dish. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below. I'm happy to help in any way that I can. For my visual people, I've also provided a link to the cook-along video. Everything will be listed below. Go bersss.\n\n**THE DOUGH\u2026** \n\n\\*\\*\\*enough for 10-12in cast iron pan.\n\n* 250g Bread Flour\n* 25g corn meal \n* 75g Olive Oil\n* 100g Warm Water (110F)\n* 3g Instant Yeast\n* 5g Salt\n\n**THE TOMATO SAUCE\u2026**\n\n* 465g San Marzano Tomatoes, drained\n* 2g Kosher Salt\n* 2g Sugar\n* 2g Red Wine Vinegar\n* 2g Dried Oregano\n* Fish Sauce TT (optional)\n\n**THE CHEESE\u2026**\n\n\\*\\*\\*50/50 Whole Milk Mozzarella / Part-skim Mozzarella... makes roughly 1 lb.\n\n* 225g Part-skim Mozzarella\n* 225g Whole Milk Mozzarella\n\n**THE PARM CRUMBLE\u2026**\n\n\\*Add a medium hunk of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to a blender or food processor and blitz it up into small crumbles. The leftover crumble saves well in the fridge and come in handy for other stuff.\n\n**\u201cSPICY\u201d ITALIAN SAUSAGE SPICE BLEND\u2026**\n\n* 3lb Pork Shoulder \n* 1lb Pork Belly (33% fat)\n* 30g Kosher Salt (3 tbsp)\n* 33g Sugar (2 tbsp)\n* 8g Fennel Seed (whole, toasted. 1.5 tbsp)\n* 2g Coriander Seed (whole, toasted, 1/ 2 tbsp)\n* 16g Sweet Paprika (2 tbsp)\n* 6g Dried Oregano (2.5 tbsp)\n* 6g Dried Basil (2.5 tbsp)\n* 6 Garlic, minced (2 cloves)\n* 8g Red Chili Flake (1.5 tbsp) \\*\\*\\*leave out for mild sausage\n* 9g Black Peppercorn (whole, toasted, 1.5 tbsp)\n* 1/2 Cup Ice Water\n* 1/4 White Wine\n\nTECHNIQUE:\n\n1. Stir flour, corn meal, yeast, salt and olive oil together.\n   1. We usually don\u2019t add salt to the dough because it slows gluten formation, but in this case we don\u2019t care about gluten formation so add it all in.\n2. Mix together long enough to form a shaggy dough, then cover and autolyse for 20-30mins at room temp.\n3. After autolyse, mix in water. Knead dough on speed 2 with dough hook for 4 mins, let dough rest for 4 minutes, then knead on speed 2 for additional 4 minutes.\n4. Round dough off, cover, and place in airtight container to bulk ferment for 2-3 hours, or until dough doubles.\n5. Preheat oven to 425F (218c).\n6. Pulse tomatoes with blender, and drain so that only chunks remain. Season tomato chunks with ingredients listed.\n7. Grate cheese, set aside.\n8. \\*\\*\\* The sausage deserves a video all on it's own and would make this recipe 4x the length. For the sausage, I'll refer you a technique video, but the ingredients above are all you need. Or opt out of this step and buy bulk Italian sausage.\n9. Butter 10 or 12 inch cast iron heavily, then sprinkle in some grated parmesan to coat the bottom and sidewalls.\n10. Use your fingers to spread the dough out, then line it in the cast iron.\n11. Lay in the cheese, then Italian sausage, then drained and seasoned diced tomatoes. Top with more parmesan crumbles.\n12. Cook the pizza on the stovetop for 5-10 minutes to give the bottom of the crust head start crisping.\n13. Transfer the pizza into the middle oven rack and bake for 30-40 mins or until the crust is a golden brown all around and pizza it hot.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Most of the time we don\u2019t add salt or sugar to the dough before autolyse because it can inhibit gluten formation, but in this case we don\u2019t care about gluten so we can add the salt to the dough early.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Stirring in the fat first stops gluten from forming heavily which makes for a flakier crust.\n\n\\*\\*\\*High fat, low hydration dough which eats more like a biscuit and helps wick away moisture from the meat, cheese and tomato sauce.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Adding the fatty cheese first helps wick away moisture from the sausage and tomatoes sauce.\n\n**Making Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza from Scratch** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fL8uLuXkl8&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fL8uLuXkl8&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)\n\nBulk Italian Sausage - https://studio.youtube.com/video/b-GZjJrlzNQ/edit/basic", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/jb2hee/recreating_chicagostyle_deep_dish_pizza_at_home/", "created_utc": 1602688248.0, "score": 48, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/jb2hee/recreating_chicagostyle_deep_dish_pizza_at_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I will take a look for common suggestions and start with  those, the vids will also include a cost and calorie breakdown so people  can make their own decisions on whether to make it or not.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/iymifd/recipes_youd_like_to_see/", "created_utc": 1600907798.0, "score": 3, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/iymifd/recipes_youd_like_to_see/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Wisconsin Style Bratwurst (Braised in Beer)", "selftext": "I'm from Chicago. To those of you who, like myself, are geographically challenged, Chicago is just south from Wisconsin. Wisconsin is known for 3 foods... beer, cheese and brats... giving the holy trinity a new meaning.\n\nBecause we're in the midst of Oktoberfest and to honor the Midwestern United States, my home, I decided to delve into the world of bratwurst and have a whack at making my own \"Sheboygan\" style brats. Sheboygan county in Wisconsin is the home of the bratwurst here in the U.S. and the area responsible for making the \"brat\" go mainstream here. The recipe is posted below, let me know if you have any questions.\n\nP.S. I've included a video for my visual people who would like to cook along. Prost!\n\n*BRATWURST MEAT...*\n\n* 4lb (1814g) Lean Pork\n* lb (453g) Pork Fat (makes 25% fat sausage)\n* 40g (4 tbsp) Kosher Salt\n* \\*Feel free to run the sausage a second time through a smaller die for a finer texture.\n* \\*\\*Roughly 10g (1 tbsp) salt per lb of sausage meat.\n\n*\u201cSHEBOYGAN\u201d SPICE BLEND: (enough for 5 lb of sausages)*\n\n* 1.5g (3 tsp) Dried Marjoram\n* 7g (2 tsp) Garlic Powder\n* 4g (2 tsp) Ginger Powder\n* 3g (6 pods) Whole Mace\n* 4g (2 tsp) Whole Allspice\n* 5g (2 tsp) Whole Caraway Seed\n* 6g (2 tsp) Whole Black Peppercorn\n* 40g (4 tbsp) Kosher Salt \\*1 tbsp per lb of protein\n* 10g (1 tbsp) Cane Sugar\n* 45ml (3 tbsp) Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 45ml (3 tbsp) Ice Water \\*add more for smoother texture\n\n\\*Toast appropriate spices then blend together. \n\n*BEER GRAVY BRAISED BRATS...*\n\n* 6-8 Bratwurst\n* 570g (2 whole) Yellow Onions\n* 15g (1-2 cloves) Garlic, minced\n* 2g (2 tsp) Black Pepper, ground\n* 3g (1 tsp) Paprika\n* 12g (2 tsp) Dark Brown Sugar\n* 12oz (1 can) Dark Beer \\*Oktoberfest is best\n* 42g (3 tbsp) Unsalted Butter\n* 8g (1 tbsp) AP Flour \n* Kosher Salt to taste\n* Optional Mustard/Sauerkraut\n\n*BEER MUSTARD*\n\n* 1/ 2 cup Yellow Mustard Seed\n* 1/ 2 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1 cup Dark Beer (Oktoberfest Marzen Lager)\n* 1/ 2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 2 tbsp Dark Brown Sugar\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n\\*Let beer/mustard/vinegar soak for a day in fridge then blitz in blender.\n\n\\*ferment 2-3 days submerged and covered at room temp.\n\n\\*Store in the fridge for 1-2 months.\n\n*SAUERKRAUT*\n\n* 2lb Cabbage/Veg\n* 1 tbsp Kosher Salt\n* Seasonings - dried herbs, spices, etc.\n\n\\*ferment 3-30 days submerged and covered at room temp\n\n\\*Store in the fridge indefinitely. Use common sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTECHNIQUE FOR SAUSAGE MAKING...\n\n1. Place all meat grinder equipment in freezer for at least 30 minutes. Soak hog casing in water for 30 mins.\n   1. Make sure casings are the right size. Some come packed in salt, so rinse the casings with water if that\u2019s the case for you. Any good butcher should sell hog casings.\n2. Dice meat and fat into small cubes, place on metal sheet tray then transfer to the freezer for 20 minutes or so.\n   1. The meat is easier to work with and holds its texture when cold, easier on your stand mixer. Making sure everything that touches the meat is cold ensures a healthy saaaasage. That fat will separate from the meat if warm - Stella culinary \n3. Measure out the spices and herbs. Toast appropriate spices on stovetop, then transfer to grinder and blend. Work spices mixture into cubed meat until evenly coated. Set aside.\n   1. Don\u2019t toast the dried herbs, they burn easily.\n4. Remove the grinder components and chilled meat from the freezer. Set the grinder up on the stand mixer with a half pan underneath to catch the meat.\n5. Insert the coarse die (8mm) and run the machine on level 2 one time letting the ground meat fall into the pan.\n   1. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bowl is super cold. However, if you\u2019d like to run the meat through the grinder again for a finer grind, chill the ground meat and grinder for 10-20 mins, then have at it a second time.\n6. Pour cold water and vinegar into the bowl with the ground meat mixture and mix with paddle attachment until the meat and fat slightly emulsify, or with a food processor if you have one.\n7. Once mixed thoroughly, attach the appropriate sausage stuffer attachment. Load the grinder and hopper up with ground meat and run it on low speed until meat comes out the end. Once meat comes out the end, turn off the stuffer and slide on your pre-soaked hog casings.\n   1. Large stuffing tube for big casings, small for skinnier casings.\n8. Hog casing on the stuffer nozzle, and meat pushed to the end, tie off a knot on the casing and begin sausage stuffing process on low heat. Use one hand to plunge in the ground meat mixture and the other to finesse the sausage as it comes out the end.\n   1. We don\u2019t want any airholes in the sausage that could lead to bursting when tying or cooking.\n   2. Don\u2019t stuff the sausages too too much or they\u2019ll be hard to twist off.\n9. Once all meat has been sausage-ified, cut off any remaining hog casing. Use a needle or cake tester to prick small holes all over the sausage to release any air bubbles.\n   1. Save extra hog casing in a container packed with salt and refrigerate. They\u2019ll last for a long time. Up to 6 months I\u2019ve read.\n10. Cook right away, or leave uncovered in the fridge for casings to dry out and flavors to meld overnight. Your call.\n   1. Serve brats with a good bun, a bit of spicy mustard, and if feeling festive some homemade sauerkraut. Orrrrrr make beer braised brats by doing the following\u2026\n   2. Brats should last in the fridge for 4-5 days, or frozen for a couple months.\n\nTECHNIQUE FOR BEER BRAISED BRATS...\n\n1. Add a bit of oil to cast iron, brown brats and flip then remove from pan.\n2. Add sliced onions to pan. Season with salt. Cook onions over medium heat stirring until they\u2019re about 25% caramelized, 10 or so minutes minutes.\n3. Once caramelized add butter, garlic, black pepper, paprika, brown sugar. Stir until incorporated then add flour to the spiced onion mixture and stir in again. Cook for 1-2 more minutes. \n4. Once mixed, stir in dark beer (oktoberfest preferably). At this step you can also add optional mustard and sauerkraut. Mix the stock and beer into the seasoned onions and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes until slightly reduced.\n5. After 5 minutes the liquid should be slightly reduced, introduce brats back into the pan with the onion braising liquid and cook until the beer gravy is thick enough to your liking and brats are cooked to at least 165F or 74c. \n6. Optional parsley or fennel frond garnish\n7. Serve with more sauerkraut and mustard. Bun and mashed potatoes optional.\n\n**Easy Homemade Bratwurst & How to Cook Beer Brats**  \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "created_utc": 1600873436.0, "score": 34, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Using a Dried Gourd to Make Pasta", "selftext": "I came across a video within the last couple of months that showed a woman making pasta by putting the dough in a dried out gourd that looked about the size of a small pot with the handle being a part of the gourd. There were holes in the bottom of the gourd uniform in size. (She had a wall where many different gourds were hanging that had holes of various sizes). Once the dough was in she held it over a bowl and patted on the dough until it was coming out of all of the holes then did a little swish with her wrist to cut off the flow before quickly moving it over a pot of boiling water. She was hitting the end of the handle with her wrist I believe to make the dough flow through the holes at an even rate. It made the most perfect looking noodles. \n\nI recently went looking for this again thinking it would be easy to find, but after 20 minutes of searching I've had no luck. Maybe my brain is fried and I just can't think of the perfect word combination to bring me the search result I'm looking for. So now here I am looking for someone else who has either seen this video and knows the correct terms for this type of cooking, has a link to the video, or really any information on this style! \n\nI just planted some giant bottle gourd seeds and was hoping to find out how to make the tool and a recipe for the noodles. If nothing else, I'll be winging it until I figure it out!

{"title": "Make Your Own with price comparisons?", "selftext": "Hi all, I'm looking for your best \"make your own\" recipes with cost comparisons to box mixes. I recently found a recipe for make your own rice a roni but I was wondering how it breaks down compared to box mix for a dollar. Anyone have some copycat recipes with price comparisons? If no pricing I'd still like to see your best recipe, things I can prep ahead with dry ingredients and then just add wet ingredients when ready to make (kind of like jar cookie mixes but with real food sides or meal items). Thanks!\n\nEdited to add I already do a decent amount of scratch cooking - like pasta sauce, mac&cheese, homemade pizza...we also occasionally buy these things, too. Annie's mac & cheese (with coupons) is a great side dish or lunch option that tastes good and homemade mac & cheese is much tastier but that's something I would make as a dinner entree. My sister and I owned a bakery for a short time. We would cost out all of our recipes in order to figure out the prices. Homemade cookies (large size) of almost any variety (choc chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter) almost all worked out to between 15-22c per cookie. Homemade brownies worked out to be around 40c (for the large bakery size serving we made). Frosting - pennies compared to can frosting unless you get it on a really great sale. A bulk recipe for pizza dough = about 25c for a 16oz pizza dough. Our local stores sell it on average $2.39 and there's a monthly sale cycle at one store where you can get 10/$10. Even Walmart is $1.73 at rollback and I believe neither of these are a full 16oz dough. I think they are 13 oz. Anyway, yes I'm interested in replacing some of the processed stuff with homemade versions if possible as long as they are easy and not too expensive. Maybe this edit helps clarify what I'm looking for. If you don't have price breakdowns but have a great homemade recipe vs something canned in the store, please share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/dj6h57/make_your_own_with_price_comparisons/", "created_utc": 1571319264.0, "score": 6, "author": "HeatherS2175", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/dj6h57/make_your_own_with_price_comparisons/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Simple Brown Veal Stock (with How-to video)", "selftext": "What's up everyone,\n\nHave you ever wondered how to make homemade stock, or have you made your own in the past?\n\nHomemade stock is worlds better/cheaper than store-bought stuff. Keeping a freezer with homemade stock reserves on deck is a surefire way to elevate your cooking at home - think restaurant quality soups, braises, flavor-packed grain dishes or reduction sauces and more. \n\nStock making is a staple, straight-forward technique that every passionate cook should be familiar with (even if you're ballin' on a budget.) The written recipe and notes are listed below. However if you're more of a visual learner I recommend checking out the video here -[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrown veal stock is simply a liquid made by slowly simmering ingredients in water and extracting flavors into liquid form. Stock is a powerful flavor base that has a load of different functions in the kitchen. I don\u2019t know many things\u2026 but one thing that I do know for sure is that preparing your own stock with vegetables, animal bones, and aromatics will not only teach you an important lesson in the kitchen, but it will also elevate whatever you usually cook with the store-bought stuff. \n\nThere are many different types of stocks from brown to white, fish to veal, but today we\u2019re going to focus in on, what I feel, is the most delicious and kitchen-life-changing: brown veal stock. To call a stock, \u201cbrown\u201d simply means that the animal bones and vegetables are roasted/charred in a hot oven before they are simmered; also a tomato product such as tomato paste is generally added for acidity, sweetness, and color (though not always.) A \u201cwhite\u201d stock simply means that the stock ingredients are not roasted before they are simmered - no color, in most cases, means less flavor. So for the sake of running through a stock-making technique, I wanted to focus on one that achieves deep flavor - brown veal stock. \n\nI\u2019m going to explain my method below. But be sure to read the extra \u201cImportant Notes\u201d at the bottom of the page. Whatever I didn\u2019t cover in the method or video will be listed down there. Let\u2019s get to it... \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 10 lbs veal bones (try and find knuckle bones)   \n \n* 3 oz (\u00bd cup) grapeseed oil (or any high-heat, neutral cooking oil)   \n \n* 1 lbs onions (4-5 medium), I like to use yellow but use what\u2019s on hand   \n \n* 8 oz carrots (1.5 large), chopped with skin on   \n \n* 8 oz celery (4-6 stalks), chopped   \n \n* Tomato paste, 1 small can10 black peppercorns   \n \n* \u00bd bunch of parsley   \n \n* \u00bd bunch thyme   \n \n* 2-3 bay leaves   \n \n* 2-3 garlic cloves   \n \n* fresh water, to cover   \n \n* \u00bd cup dry red wine   \n \n\n**Method:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Start by rubbing the veal bones with grapeseed oil. Some people scoff at using oil, but I find that it helps the bones achieve solid browning. Plus if you do a good job skimming, it\u2019s easy to deal with.   \n \n2. Next, roast in a pre-heated 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C oven for 1 hour, or until they turn deep golden brown in color. Make sure to rotate the bones half way through to make sure things char evenly.   \n \n3. Meanwhile, prepare your Mirepoix like you did the bones, by rubbing the vegetables with oil. I don\u2019t like to peel my carrots or onions - the skin has a ton of flavor locked inside.   \n \n4. Once the time has passed, check on your bones, they should have some beautiful color. Remove them from the oven and rub with the tomato paste until covered, but not plastered on. You probably don\u2019t have to use the entire can of paste. Place the tomato covered bones back in oven for another 20-25 minutes until the tomato paste starts to caramelize.   \n \n5. To be efficient with your time, start roasting off your mirepoix with your tomato-smeared bones on a separate tray. Though they likely won\u2019t be finished at the same time as your bones, it\u2019s good to get things rolling.   \n \n6. Place bones in a large, heavy bottomed stockpot.   \n \n7. Place the tray used to roast our bones over the stove and heat over medium-high. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, or water and use a wooden spoon to scrape the crispy bits stuck to the tray. Technically these crispies are known as \u201cfond.\u201d Pour the wine and fond mixture into the stockpot with the bones.   \n \n8. By now, your mirepoix should be getting there. Once finished and charred, add the mirepoix to the stockpot.   \n \n9. Fill the stockpot with enough cold water to cover the bones by at least 2-3 inches. Using cold water encourages a clearer stock. If you don\u2019t care about the clarity, use warm or hot water. Just make sure the water you\u2019re using is high-quality and clean.   \n \n10. Once hot, add the peppercorns, parsley, thyme, garlic and bay leaf. Some people like to wrap these aromatics in cheese cloth with twine known as a \u201csachet\u201d, but I don\u2019t see a need to do so. We\u2019re going to strain everything out at the end, so it seems redundant to me. But if you want to wrap things up in a cute lil\u2019 bundle, please, be my guest.   \n \n11. Heat stock over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to low and maintain a slow simmer. Do not allow the stock to boil or it will emulsify the remaining fat from the bones and make things clouded. \\*See note for \u201cthe oven trick.\u201d   \n \n12. Simmer for 8-12 hours, skimming with a ladle as necessary. Skimming is VERY important and you can\u2019t forget to do it or else your stock will be a foggy, fatty, sloppy mess. To skim, simply dip a ladle in the stock and remove any built up protein particles, fat and other scum. I like to do this every hour at least once, but I might be a little obsessive. A cool hack that allows for easier skimming is to pull the stockpot halfway off the heat. The fat and scum will collect to one side in a cycle, making things easier to skim.   \n \n13. After the stock is finished, strain through a course strainer (\u201cchina cap\u201d) and then through a fine mesh strainer (\u201cchinois.\u201d) \\*See YouTube video for links to purchase the same gear I use in the video.   \n \n\n\\*\\*\\* If you don\u2019t plan to use the stock immediately, store in fridge for up to 5 days or freeze any leftover stock - it\u2019ll stay good for up to 3 months. I like to keep them in labeled deli containers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Important Notes:* \n\nSTOCK IS A FLAVOR BASE; stock is used to make other dishes and is often reduced down to concentrate flavor. This means that you shouldn\u2019t season it with salt at any step during the cooking process; also, refrain from using any strong/overpowering ingredients. Keep the stock pure so that flavors can be added as needed to create specific dishes/sauces - shoutout to all my people with commitment issues. \n\nBROTH vs. STOCK: Simply put, broth is made of meat and stock is made from bones. Broth is generally lighter whereas stock is rich and has more body (a heavier mouthfeel) due to the collagen in the bones which, throughout the cooking process, breaks down into gelatin. \n\nBONES. Speaking of collagen\u2026 I like to use knuckle bones for veal stock. Generally, knuckle bones have much more collagen ready to be unlocked into gelatin from within. Though I\u2019m not afraid to throw in some marrow bones and/or meat scraps in my stock pot along with the knuckle bones. When making poultry stock look for backs, wings and necks as these all contain a buttload of collagen, too. \n\n\u201cTHE OVEN TRICK\u201d - One way to keep your stove range free of clutter is to simmer stock in the oven. Simply set your oven to 200F (93c) and place your stock pot inside once all of your ingredients and water have been added. I\u2019ve made stock this way a few times, but there are pros and cons. A couple pros are that your kitchen has less clutter and your stove is free to cook other things on and you can leave the oven on through the night and simmer the stock for the 8-12 hours while you sleep. The cons are that it\u2019s sort of a pain in the ass to continuously move the stock pot from the oven to the stovetop to skim off the protein aggregates, fat and other scum. I typically make my stock the traditional way, on the stove, but the oven trick works, too. Play around with both techniques and see which you prefer. \n\nWHAT IS \u201cMIREPOIX?\u201d Mirepoix is just a fancy French word for a flavor base of carrots/celery and onion. The classic ratio is 2 parts onion: 1 part celery: 1 part carrots. A good rule of thumb is for every 5 pounds of bones, use 1 pound of mirepoix. \n\nUSE QUALITY WATER! If you live in a spot with hard water, or just bad water in general, use store-bought stuff either bottled or in the jug. Make sure to use cold water to start your stock if you want it to be clearer and less foggy - this won\u2019t affect the taste, however. \n\nAROMATICS. The aromatics that I like to use in my veal/beef stock include bay leaf, parsley, thyme, black peppercorns and garlic. The amount in which you use is all preference based. \n\n\u201cREDUCTION,\u201d is a technique used to reinforce flavor. Veal stock isn\u2019t always used as is, but is generally reduced by half with the addition of mirepoix and aromatics. This is done to concentrate flavor and provide a more viscous mouth feel (give the stock \u201cbody\u201d). Check out my \u201cEasy Pan Sauce\u201d video to see how I reduce veal stock into a yummy, complex steak sauce. \n\nWHITE STOCK vs. BROWN STOCK. To make a white veal stock, simply rinse the veal bones with cold water. Place the rinsed bones in your stockpot with cold water and bring to a simmer. After this blanching phase, pour off the water and keep the veal bones in the stockpot. Doing this will allow any protein particles and other scum to detach from the bones giving you a cleaner, more delicate stock. Once your bones are blanched, simply follow the steps in this recipe but skip over the pre-simmer roasting process for the animal bones and mirepoix. This same method can be used for poultry stocks, as well. Though, as I mentioned, I highly recommend making brown stock as they are MUCH MORE FLAVORFUL. If you\u2019re going to spend your hard earned cash on quality ingredients, wouldn\u2019t you want to conjure the tastiest stock?

Set to simmer down to a jus (de Canard), at this point I play with the salt and pepper to get the flavoring right\n* Meat gets pulled and put in a pan with the jus added, on low heat, so that plenty of the liquid in the jus is vaporised and all the flavors get absorbed into the pulled duck\n* Once there is next to no liquid forming if you lightly press a fork onto the meat take off heat, put into jars, add a tiny amount of goosefat from the confit, stir, and the coat the top with goosefat so that it will form a protective layer when cooled.\n\nMy philosophy is that less is more, but a tiny amount of flavoring really brings out the bright duck flavors while muting any gameyness. Using whiskey instead of wine will take away some sourness while adding some woodsy earthyness which I feel compliments the duck well. The sweet soy, carrot and onions give a slight sweetness that just warms up the entire taste.\n\nIs there a dark horse I left out like star anise that really puts the REEE in Rillette, or did I already overdo it, as I am wont to?\n\nLastly: I've seen several recipes throw out the bones and skin and the juices without making it into a jus. This seems like throwing away the very soul of the dish or am I missing something here? Also, I'd love to make this using entire ducks to lower my cost but I have found it extremely difficult to get a hold of duck for less than the price of just the legs (about 8 euros per kilo in NL, Europe).

{"title": "App to track you pantry / food inventory?", "selftext": "Hello /r/FromScratch ! I am a senior Computer Information Systems student and would love your help designing an app!  \n&nbsp;  \nThe basis of the app is to track the amount of food you have on hand and optionally, the price you paid for that food. I believe that this app could be extremely useful for making things from scratch because it would allow you to be at the store and know what you have already in the house. Potentially saving you money and allowing you to make more items from scratch. What I am looking for is your feedback in the form of a really quick survey about what you would like to see in an app like this. Or, if it even useful at all to you. (Any feedback is welcome!) I also encourage you to comment below, I will be very active with replying to any feedback, questions, etc. The survey is 100% anonymous, unless you enter your email for the mailing list.  \n&nbsp;  \n**If you're already interested, here is the survey:** https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvLGR6fAoJOo1FHG9v6hsXZjP4GBPTQ3liK3pibff9LpZwqQ/viewform  \nBelow is more information about the app and the philosophy behind it.  \n&nbsp;  \n**My philosophy for this apps progress:**\n\n&nbsp;  \n1) **Make your life better, not hinder it**. The first question that comes to people's mind is, \"How will I update my pantry of food?\" \n\nMy current ideas for this are:\n\n- Manually, as you eat the food subtract it from your inventory\n\n- As you add items to a shopping list the app prompts for an updated inventory quantity\n\n- When you scan a receipt in, it asks for updated quantities of matching receipts/inventory items\n\nIf you have an idea for this please feel free to comment here or add it to the survey!\n\n&nbsp;  \n2) **Design.** I will be sticking to the full slate of design standards for the operating system that the app is on. Whether that be Android, iOS, or desktop, my goal is to make this app look appealing and seamless ad well as efficient.\n\n&nbsp;  \n3) **No ads. No pay walls for main features**. I am not going into this app looking for money. I am trying to solve a problem that I have in my everyday life (more on that later.) I would rather have a beautifully designed app that everyone uses for free rather than a beautifully designed app that no one uses because it costs too much money. Now, this isn't a guarantee that there won't be some kind of payment in the future. Servers do cost money (if the app ever needed them) but the core features of this app, tracking food inventory, will always be free to use, and ad-free.\n\n&nbsp;  \nIf this is something you're interested in please fill the survey out where you can input your email to get more information as it becomes available!\n\nThanks for your time!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "created_utc": 1487867741.0, "score": 30, "author": "klutch2013", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "html_title": ""}

The Muesli i'm using is \"Bob's Red Mill Brand - Old Country Style Muesli\", which contains dried Dates, and I would like to expound upon that exotic/tropical fruit flavor with a couple of the other listed ingredients. I'm really hoping to come out of this with a usable recipe including measurements of each ingredient, baking temp/time, etc. So here is my rough list of currently considered ingredients - (I understand that my list may be overkill or incomplete, so I am open to all constructive criticism and ideas.):\n\nReal Maple Syrup or Brown Sugar or Raw Honey or Molasses\n\nCrushed Graham Crackers\n\nMarshmallow Cream\n\nCinnamon and possibly a hint of Coffee\n\nBob's Red mill Old Country Style Muesli\n\nEgg\n\nBanana Flour\n\nUnsweetened \"Almond Breeze\" Milk in place of dairy Milk (this product is a 50/50 mix of Almond and Coconut Milk)\n\nReal vanilla Extract\n\nCoconut Oil (can it be used as a good substitute for Butter?)\n\nAnd ofcourse some form of Chocolate to complete the S'more aspect, be it Ghirardelli Semi-sweet Morsels, or maybe a ~60% Cacao Chocolate bar crushed into morsel sized chunks?\n\nBesides that, I am unsure of what else I may need. Baking Powder? etc.\n\nDoes this list of ingredients sound like it could be a winner in the right proportions?

{"title": "Beef Rice Tacos w/ Pico from scratch", "selftext": "http://i.imgur.com/IMgeuQah.jpg\n\nThe kitchen is being renovated and I didn't pack up the kitchen supplies very wisely.   So, working with what I had: mexican rice, cheese, tortillas, and enchilada sauce, one knife, one fork, one cast iron skillet, I made this taco.   On a paper towel.\n\n#The Taco\n\nI poured in a thin coat of untoasted sesame oil into my skillet and gave the tortilla a little browning and char on each side.   Set aside tortilla, fry pre-cooked rice in the same oil, added enchilada sauce and cheese I cubed with the knife.   When the cheese was melted I put this mixtue on top of the tortilla shell.   Topped with organic cilantro and pico.\n\n\n#Mexican Rice, Microwaved\n\n\nI put 1/3 cup dry rice, 1/3 cup water and 1/3 cup pizza sauce I had made (just tomato sauce with italian seasoning) and 1 teaspoon of beef bouillon into a bowl, sprinkle liberally with cumin, cover with wax paper, then microwave for six minutes.   The rice was too dry at this point so I added a splash more water and microwaved again.\n\n\n#Enchilada Sauce\n\n\nThis is just (3 tablespoons flour/fat) a roux that you add a can tomato sauce to, a cup of beef broth, and a lot of chilli pepper to taste, and reduce until the desired consistency.

{"title": "Why is my pizza dough so inconsistent?", "selftext": "I have been making pizza for several  years at home and I usually use a recipe from cooks illustrated.  For the first year or two I used a food processor but then somehow or another we moved and lost it.  The food processor always seemed to do pretty well.  \n\nSo we ended up getting a top of the line kitchenaid mixer and I've had very inconsistent success with it.  Due to my understanding of how to manipulate the dough I can usually salvage it but basically the dough rarely forms a nice ball in the mixer.  Every once in a while it will form a nice ball with the EXACT same measurement, and temperature water and everything, then other times it's just a complete mess.  I end up having to add a half cup or more of flour to get it to ball up a bit.  When I pull the dough out of the mixer then it's SUPER sticky.  It's like super glue in my hands.  I then kneed it for a min or two on the counter and fold it on itself to form a ball then let is rise for several hours.  When it starts out super sticky like that the dough is often very weak after rising.  Like if i tried to toss it in the air the dough would just blow apart.  I have to be very careful with it on the counter and finesse it other wise holes rip very easily.\n\nSo what am I doing wrong?  Am i over kneeding the dough in the mixer?  Am I under kneeding?  Something just isn't right.  I see videos of people stretching their dough out like it's nothing and the dough just cooperates and doesn't rip holes and looks great.\n\nMy recipe is\n4 cups flour (I have best success with McAurther bread flour, unbleached)\n\n1-1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n2 table spoons olive oil\n\n2-1/4 teaspoon yeast\n\n1-3/4 cup water at 120F", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/2rbfdd/why_is_my_pizza_dough_so_inconsistent/", "created_utc": 1420395255.0, "score": 8, "author": "yARIC009", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/2rbfdd/why_is_my_pizza_dough_so_inconsistent/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I analysed the recipes for Five Spice Powder, and this is what I found [x-post from /r/recipes]", "selftext": "*Was told you guys would enjoy this so I hope you do!*\n\nFive Spice Powder is as famous a foreign ingredient can get, while remaining a complete mystery. Most people know what it is, but if you ask them the ingredients, you\u2019ll be greeted with many blank stares, or incomplete answers. The reason is simple, there is no fixed recipe.\n\nIn a way, Five Spice is a lot like what Curry Powder is for Indians. Ask any Indian household what curry powder is, and you\u2019ll be quickly told that there are many kinds of different curry powders to suit individual curries. Recipes also vary from house to house, city to city, and state to state! In this regard, Five Spice is very similar. Recipes vary from household to household and province to province. **In some special cases, such as in Sichuan Province, entire ingredients are different** (they prefer to substitute Fennel Seeds / Ginger for Sichuan Peppercorns)!\n\nBut what goes of the household brands that sell the blend in supermarkets? How do they cater to the masses? Upon even just the most basic investigation, we find that there is no consensus at all. Not only do recipes vary tremendously, but **often the most unexpected ingredients such as Cardamom and even cornflour (!) make an appearance**, most likely to save on cost. We also noticed that certain staple ingredients such as Cloves are normally missing, due to their high price. These tend to be substituted with ordinary cumin seeds, pepper, liquorice or other odd items. To add to the curiousness, many supermarkets in our local market of Hong Kong, didn\u2019t sell the blend at all!\n\n(See link below for photos of labels from existing products)\n\nMy next goal was to reproduce the ideal recipe, assuming cost was no issue. Although some sources on the web pointed towards True Cinnamon being used for Five Spice, this we quickly dismissed \u2013 China hasn\u2019t consumed True Cinnamon in large quantities ever, as they much prefer to their local flavour of the spice, Cassia. We quickly found that Star Anise, Cassia, Fennel Seeds and Cloves were essential ingredients for all Five Spice blends, regardless of where you were in China. The last ingredient varies by province to province.\n\nIn the Southern parts of China, Ginger root and Mandarin Orange Peel are often preferred, probably due to the fact that this is where they originate from. Other parts of China use Sichuan Peppers, Chinese Black Cardamom, and even Galangal. But we were on the journey for the most preferred taste. After countless taste tests, and more research, we landed on our target: Chinese Ginger Roots. The reason turned out to be much simpler than expected: **Ginger is one of the most popular ingredients in Chinese cooking, and also contributes a key flavour to the blend, not found in the other ingredients. Citrus.** Ginger is also extremely popular in other regions where Five Spice is used: Vietnam, Indonesia, and other Asian countries all make heavy use of Ginger in regular cooking.\n\n\n**The final recipe**\n\n- Star Anise (1 star)\n- Cassia (1-2 grams)\n- Cloves (1-2 grams)\n- Fennel Seeds (1-2 grams)\n- Ginger (1-2 grams)\n\nInstructions: Grind them all together. Use around 0.5g per dish.\n\nI know it varies, but these proportions mimic the Five Spice philosophy perfectly: personalise it!\n\n[Link to blog for photos of other ingredients labels, one even openly admitted it mixed in flour.](http://regencyspices.hk/spicetrade/2014/08/05/five-spice-powder-whats-real-recipe/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "created_utc": 1407254518.0, "score": 76, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Which Grain Mill For Flour?", "selftext": "My girlfriend and I brew whole grain beer and we decided it was time to utilize all this spent grain we had! So we purchased the KitchenAid grain mill attachment for our KitchenAid mixer. It's a beautiful attachment, solidly built and looks ready to mill anything.\n\nUsing it for two days, I can safely say that it is not what we thought it would be. The grain is completely dry (we baked it in the oven for a whole day), but I am finding that it is just gumming up in the grinder and fear for the mixer motor since it turns and turns and barely anything comes out! We adjusted all the settings and did a larger grind with limited success, it would either pass through un-milled or not at all. I also think that the grain itself is too light and airy (compared to wheat berries). Anyone know of any other options? Our food processor doesn't get it fine enough and we don't want to run it through our coffee grinder. Anyone experience anything similar? Have any suggestions of what we could do? We usually just cut the whole grains in with regular flour but we were wanting a finer texture. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: Dry spent grains not grinding and gumming up KitchenAid Grain Mill attachment, other alternatives and/or mill's I should look into to make it into flour?\n\nUPDATE: We ended up hitting Bob's Red Mill up here in Portland and getting some real wheat berries and spelt berries and when we were milling them we'd cut it with a little (now very dry) spent grain and it would give it enough weight to grind it through. Made some awesome pretzels the other day with it.

{"title": "Suggestions for Tortilla Chips made from scratch", "selftext": "Hello everyone. I live in Argentina and Mexican food is not readily available. I make my own tortillas because the locally sold stuff is crap. I can make both flour tortillas and corn tortillas (the corn tortillas are actually a mixture of corn flour and regular all-purpose flour). I have tried making tortilla chips with my own tortillas and they never turn out right, can never get the right crunch, sometimes none at all. \n\nIs it the oil I'm using? I've tried both lard, canola and sun flower seed oil. \n\nDo the tortillas need to be a little stale? For how long should I leave them out for? \n\nDo the tortillas need to be rolled out really thin? Sometimes my homemade ones come out a little on the thick side because of personal preferences. \n\nAlso, any tips for conserving tortilla chips so I can make a large batch and eat them throughout the week. \n\nAny advice is very appreciated!
