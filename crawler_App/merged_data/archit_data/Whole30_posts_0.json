As we do the whole30 I understand we want a replacement for RICE. This is not the replacement we need. The main problem with cauliflower rice is the consistency. It never quite softens to the point where it FEELS like rice and will never allow for each kernel to absorb the juices of whatever you are adding to the cauliflower rice. This is a problem because when I eat my Whole30 curry or chicken fried cauliflower rice, I'd like to eat a nice flavorful bite of what I expect. However, I instead take a bite of crunchy bland white kernels of regret. The cauliflower rice somehow REMOVES flavor from the dish. I don't understand what dark arts are being used by the cauliflower rice, but it is unholy. We need to band together and stop cauliflower rice from being a staple in the whole30.

They were actually the best ribs I may have ever had. \nSo I\u2019m dating this new dude, and he\u2019s super cool about my whole30-ness and has been super supportive. He\u2019ll come over and I\u2019ll cook and he does all the dishes and even clean my stovetop (wut? He\u2019s perfect.) but holy holy last night I made these ribs and I\u2019m pretty sure I could lead a religious movement with this recipe so buckle the f-ck up. \n\nOK SO I used my instant pot and I did about 3/4 cups of broth and about 1 1/2 tbsp liquid smoke. \nI rubbed the ribs with equal parts salt, paper, garlic powder, all seasoning, and Cajun spices. \n I seriously got 2 full racks in the instant pot. In the pot, stand the racks on their side on top of the basket. If you\u2019re only doing one rack, it\u2019s easy just stick em right in like I said and pressure cook for 35. If you\u2019re taking it by the titties like I did with 2, you have to kind of wrap them. Think yin and yang. Cook the 2 for 45. \nOk so the bbq sauce\nI used\n8 majool dates, a small can of tomato paste, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1cup water, 2 tbsp Dijon mustard, 2tbsp coconut aminos, and 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper, and I added like 4 of these crazy good but hella spicy pickled jalape\u00f1os (holla atcha girl if you want that recipe but definitely not for the weak-of-mouth). Simmer over medium heat and keep stirring for like 8-10 min and use an immersion blender or transfer to a blender to mix. Set aside to cool and get thicc \n\nDo a quick release w those bad rib bois and be thoughtful taking them out, their gonna wanna fall apart. My suggestion is to take em out by the basket. Set em in a baking sheet w tin foil and slaaaaaather both sides with that good good bbq sauce you just made (proud o\u2019 you). Turn on the broiler in your oven and set it to high. Put in your lil bbq babies and let em sit in there for 10 min. \n\nOk so I knew they were gonna be *good*. But holy baby Lizzo, these were INSANE. I seriously think if I go down the line w this new (6\u20193\u201d bearded) hunk, I will ask him the moment he knew. And he *will* say it was these ribs. \nTrouble w the missus? Make these ribs. Proposing to your lil sugar babie? Do it over these f-cking ribs. Starting a cult? Gain followers with the promise and glory of these ribs.  It *will* work. \n\nLmk if you try them and have the same experience. I hope you do \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nUpdate: I f-cking love y\u2019all.

What gives?\n\nAlso great work!", "We started Whole30 on February 15th but didn't have the sense to take a picture together! We were just wrapping up a round when quarantine hit. We knew if we didn't lean in to healthy choices it would be too easy to regress. At the end of every month, we have decided to re-up for another one.\n\nWe did our first round past April. It felt life-changing. About a month later, I injured myself at the gym and had to have surgery a few months later to repair my knee. Recovery from my surgery took about four months. I got the flu in January and stepped on the scale at the doctor's office and was dismayed to see the number that I saw. I knew we had to make some big changes. I'm not going to lie. The week we decided we were going to start, I went to my favorite breakfast place and had \"one last\" breakfast sandwich. But we kept delaying it by another day and so I just kept going for one more sandwich. I ended up going every single day that week before we finally got started!\n\nPassing day 100 felt like a big milestone. We feel amazing. I posted some of this as a comment to someone else's post, but I feel it warrants repeating in case it might encourage others.\n\nMy lifelong insomnia is gone. My skin is clear and literally glows. I used to get daily \"hunger headaches\" that were only solved by eating - gone. My mind is clearer. I'm not so tired all the dang time. Our energy levels are high. We have kicked nighttime snacking to the curb. We generally don't succumb to emotional eating and when/if we do we can acknowledge it and the actual item being eaten is not junk.  Roasted pumpkin seeds and almonds are the closest thing to junk we eat now. Our relationship with food has been broken down and rebuilt from the ground up. And for the most part I don't feel deprived and I'm never hungry all day - the two things that have never interested me about traditional dieting. I've even been able to buy treats for my kids to eat that do not tempt me at all, like cupcakes at Easter or muffins for breakfast. My husband and I are all in together on it and it's terrific.\n\nMy husband has lost almost 50 lb and I have lost 40. He is at his ideal weight and feeling great (looking great too!!!). I have a long way still to go but for the first time in my life I feel like it's within my power to get to a healthier weight.  Someone took a picture of me a few weeks ago and secretly I couldn't stop looking at it for a few days because I felt so amazed and proud of how different I look. \n\nAt some point we will probably transition to a 80/20 ratio of food freedom but I'm not ready yet. We feel too good. My progress towards better health is steady and it's exciting. When we started I was probably at my highest weight or within 5 pounds of it. Now I'm at my lowest of the last ten years. I'm hoping we can stick to it for another few months... I'm curious to see if I keep losing weight as effortlessly as now! I know at some point it will slow down but I'm highly motivated these days! I want to continue feeling as good as I do now, and the things that used to tempt me have very little power over me. \n\nThat's our story thus far. I'll post another update if we make it to whole150!", "You should be so proud. Congrats to you for making healthy decisions!!!

Ingredients that don't work are flagged either Yellow or Red.\n\nYou can also customize Fig with your other dietary needs: food allergies, Low FODMAP, or if you just want to avoid specific ingredients like cucumber or xanthan gum.\n\nOne of the main goals with Fig is to help teach label reading skills, so you can click on any ingredient to learn more about it.\n\nSome things we're still working on:\n\n* Making sure non-compliant products are flagged correctly. For example, we flag pre-packaged products like tortillas, pizza, chips, etc. as Red, even if their ingredients are technically compliant, but we're still working to make sure we've flagged all of these correctly.

Thanks so much for all the kind words and support! Based on your requests, we spent time building a [Firefox version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fig/), too. That version is now live.\n\nClick on any ingredient in Fig to learn more about why it may not be Whole30 compliant. If you have other needs or preferences besides Whole30, you can customize which ingredients are flagged for you from a list of more than 2,000 ingredients.\n\n**From the old post:**\n\nMy name is Andrew, and I was diagnosed with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) back in 2014. The primary treatment for IBS is diet (it's called the Low FODMAP diet), and there are literally hundreds of ingredients you have to limit or avoid. In many ways, it's very similar to living Whole 30 and can make grocery shopping difficult \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI started building Fig earlier this year with two friends who also have dietary restrictions - food allergies, vegetarian, gluten, etc. Fig works with a number of diets - see the [Chrome link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fig-grocery-recipe-ingred/gddhicbfkbaeciiogipbgjdmkjdfanng) or the [Firefox link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fig/) for the full list.\n\nI spent a lot of time making sure Fig flags ingredients correctly and writing ingredient annotations (thanks to my dietitian for helping me with this!) If you find anything wrong, please let me know and I'll fix it ASAP. I know from my own experiences how critical it is to get dietary restrictions right!\n\nThanks also to u/MelissaUrban for her comments and feedback. One of the best parts about the Whole30 diet is learning to read ingredient labels and considering everything we put into our bodies. I highly recommend that you use Fig as a helpful supplemental tool and continue to invest in learning what is and isn't Whole30 yourself! It's an incredible, life-long skill.\n\nFig is still a work in progress, so please let me know if you find any errors or if you have ideas for how to improve it.

Presentation is \ud83d\udc4c", "I will leave my recipe for duck confit with cherry/duck jus reduction here. It is certainly a meal that helps you forget you\u2019re on a diet. \n\nFor the duck: start by salting quarters liberally on both fat and flesh sides, leave in fridge for at least an hour or up to 24 for salt to penetrate(this step can be skipped but recommended for even seasoning throughout). Then, with a sharp knife poke shallow holes in the fat to help render before placing skin side down in a Dutch oven with the lid fully covered. Add any aromatics that you like in the pot (I generally like ginger, chili, garlic, bay leaf and thyme). Bake in oven @ 250 degrees for 4 hours, flipping quarters half way through. By the 2 hour mark there should be nearly enough fat to fully submerge all the quarters. Once meat is nearly falling off the bone, pull duck from pot and set aside, skin side up on a baking sheet. I like to  do all of this ahead and leave the quarters in the fridge uncovered until 30 mins before serving. \n\nWhat to do with all the stuff left in the pot? Strain remaining duck fat from the spent aromatics into a heat proof bowl and allow to cool before placing in freezer. Once fat has fully solidified in freezer (about an hour) scrape fat from top and save fore other cooking applications in fridge. In The bottom of the bowl  you\u2019ll be left with a concentrated duck jus that is perfect for the sauce. \n\nA half hour before ready to serve, pop the duck quarters in a preheated oven @ 450 (with convection if available/ airfryer would work too).

{"title": "I DID IT!!! 30 days!", "selftext": "I finished the 30 days of my very first ever Whole30!! I thought I\u2019d share my experience for anyone thinking of doing it.\n\n\n\nBackground: I\u2019m 45 (f), a fairly active person who has been pretty conscientious of what I eat for most of my life. But over the last 4 years I\u2019ve been really sluggish, foggy in the head and just dealing with crazy heavy periods as well as daily end of the day bloating that almost feels debilatating. I gained about 15 lbs during Covid that just won\u2019t budge. I can\u2019t get in to see my Dr. for quite some time to chat about these things, so I turned to Whole30 to see how I could help myself in the meantime while I wait.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou guys, I am SO glad that I did. This is literally the best I have felt in YEARS. I have been sleeping great at night, I no longer feel the need to take a nap in the afternoon just to survive. The cravings come and go, but honestly have really dwindled over the 30 days. Instead of feeling bloated and uncomfortable at the end of the day, I\u2019m energized enough to take my sweet pups on extra long walks to enjoy the evening.\n\n\n\nMy biggest takeaways for making this a success are:\n\n* prep prep prep - the more you can have easy things on hand, the more success you have dealing with hunger and cravings. If you\u2019re hungry, eat something, and being prepared takes the guess work out.\n* find things you like and stick with it. Don\u2019t feel like you need to reinvent the wheel each week with menu planning. I found things that I looked forward to eating and that kept me full and stuck with those for breakfast, lunch and snacks. Dinner was where I allowed myself to play around with variety.\n* fruit - this was a lifesaver for sweet cravings. Cold crunchy watermelon and dried fruits kept me sane\n* pickles - this really checked the salty box for me. Even just to grab ONE tiny kosher dill made me happy when my family was busting out the Pringles! Lol\u00a0\n* wine and Diet Coke have probably been the things I missed the most and had the most anxiety about giving up. But now after 30 days, I might just never return to them. The benefit of time has allowed me to reflect and wonder what purpose they serve in my life other than the pseudo-satisfactory crutch of habitual behavior.\n* Eggs! Turns out I have a mild egg intolerance. I would have never known this had I not already eliminated so many other things. It was so easy to pinpoint this and will be helpful when making food choices moving forward.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am excited for the reintroduction phase. I\u2019ll be starting with cheese. A super sharp slice of cheddar with an apple has been on my mind, so stay tuned!\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1fe94hf/i_did_it_30_days/", "created_utc": 1726058434.0, "score": 155, "author": "ConsiderationSea3909", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1fe94hf/i_did_it_30_days/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Way to go!

{"title": "The Lazy Guide to the Whole30", "selftext": "This is for anyone who feels the hardest part of eating healthy is all the work!  There are no recipes here, just simple ideas.  Disclaimer, this post often sacrifices taste for convenience, so might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea.\n\nShopping list:\n\n* Don\u2019t underestimate canned food.  Canned veggies, tuna, and pasta sauce are great.  If you can find a compliant soup, stock up (I have the best luck with varieties like Split Pea, Butternut squash, or Bone Broth).  Do check every label, there is added sugar in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Premade condiments: I\u2019d recommend at least getting a compliant mayo and ketchup.  Salad dressing if you\u2019d like (personally I prefer olive oil + vinegar).\n   * Tessamae\u2019s, Primal Kitchen, Newman\u2019s Own \u201cDairy Free\u201d line\n* Frozen: chicken breasts, fish fillets, burger patties, veggies\n* Fresh: salad mix, eggs, potatoes, fruit\n* For coffee drinkers: nutpods or coconut milk.  Also, if you still don\u2019t like your coffee, give cold brew a try!\n* Sparkling flavored waters\n\nBreakfast\n\n* First, you can eat anything for breakfast, including last night\u2019s leftover chili or a salad.  Don\u2019t feel limited!\n* Hard boiled eggs\n* Fruit\n* Compliant pre-cooked sausage\n* Smoked salmon\n* For a little effort: a scramble with whatever veggies in your fridge or freezer.  I like pre-cut mushrooms.\n\nLunch\n\n* Salad (pre-washed mix, of course), topped with\n   * canned tuna\n      * or any other canned fish, I\u2019ve only bought tuna myself\n   * canned chicken\n      * want more flavor? Toss your chicken/tuna with guacamole, mayo, Frank\u2019s Redhot, or a vegan pesto\n   * shredded rotisserie chicken\n   * shredded deli slices (read labels, they often contain dextrose)\n   * hard boiled egg\n   * any leftover meat.  Anything you might put in a taco is great on salad.\n   * a \u201cprotein salad\u201d (from the original whole 30 book) is also a good salad topping. I\u2019ll make a good size batch of this so I can use it for several days.\n* Soup\n   * I like to make a double batch, putting about half in the freezer, and eat it all week\n   * Chili and Chicken soup are my staples\n\nDinner\n\nI will often just eat the above salad for lunch and chili/soup for dinner every day.  However, you can have some more variety without too much additional effort:\n\n* Pan fry a chicken breast or fish fillet, open a can of veggies on the side\n* Burgers (I put mine on some salad mix with ketchup/mayo).\n* Crockpot dinners:  Could serve on top of cauli rice (which you can buy frozen and microwave)\n   * Chicken+ salsa\n   * Roast+onion+peppers\n   * pork+compliant bbq sauce\n* Zoodles + pasta sauce.  They taste better fresh but can be bought pre-spiraled frozen.  Can add some ground meat here if you want.\n* A microwaved potato or sweet potato \u2013 good as a side with some ghee, or if you wanted to make it a meal, \u201cstuff\u201d it with some leftover crockpot meat from above.\n\nSnacks:\n\n* nuts\n* dried or fresh fruit\n* sunflower seeds\n* guacamole, almond butter, or dressing with mini carrots/celery\n* mini sweet peppers with Kite Hill spreads\n* Larabars (read labels)\n\nThe guide would not be complete without mentioning Meal Delivery.  You can find a list of Whole30 endorsed delivery services on the Whole30 website.  These are great if you don't want to have to think about it.  However, you are not limited to just those brands.  Check out any company that caters to the special diet crowd, particularly if they offer paleo!

But it\u2019s part of her re examining the program in light of her social justice education. \n\nThere is this though: https://whole30.com/tough-love/", "Yup, these are my feelings exactly. On days I'm having a hard time staying on Whole30 and I see this phrase it honestly makes it worse for me. I know it was meant to be motivational but I think it's more demeaning than anything but I suppose it's just the headspace that you approach it from. Your not alone though", "Melissa Urban and the Whole30 team appear to agree with you on this. They published an updated version of the OG Whole30 Cookbook, now called \"Cooking Whole30\", which came out today, and the tough love section now reads:  \n\n\n>You Can Do Hard Things  \n>  \n>The whole30 is famous for its tough love, but don't be nervous - it's heavy on the love. At this point, many of you want to take on this life-changing self-experiment, but aren't sure you can really do it. If you've spent your whole life dieting, those efforts have likely left you discouraged, and skeptical that the Whole30 really is different. It is - I promise. And also, you're going to have to do the work. Here are a few key mindset shifts I want you make heading into your Whole30, os you can step into your power, reclaim your confidence, and keep this promise to yourself.  \n>  \n>**This will be hard.** There are so many road-blocks to changing the way you eat. For some, it's emotional ties to comfort foods. For others, it's time or budget concerns. For still others, it's missing culturally significant foods. I honor the tremendous efforts many of you will go through just to complete the Whole30. And still, you have done harder things in your life. Losing a parent is hard. Fighting cancer is hard. Birthing a baby is hard. The Whole30 may also be hard, but you are more powerful than you give yourself credit for, and I know you can do this too.", "Yeah. I\u2019ve done three Whole30s and really believe in it, but the whole \u201cthis isn\u2019t hard, lemme tell you what\u2019s hard\u201d drill sergeant vibe is a huuuuuuuuuge turnoff for me.", "Yes. I saw that and was like \u201cnot again\u201d. It may not be hard if you don\u2019t have a sugar addiction, or when you don\u2019t have an addicts need your brain keeps saying \u201cI want it\u201d over and over, affecting your life, your work, your relationships. I\u2019m done calling it \u201ccravings\u201d and lying. It\u2019s an addiction. I\u2019m an addict, my drug is sugar. I\u2019m both excited and nervous to start this tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to fail. Just going to have to take it one day at a time.", "I find this to be one of the most troubling aspects of their materials. It's so patronizing of them to assume someone lacks perspective just because they struggle to drastically change their diet in a culture of food abundance, obsession, and dysfunction. This month I did a round while my best friend gave birth to twins. I miss cheese, but I don't need them to yell at me that she had the harder task.\n\nWhile I'm glad Melissa has chilled out on the \"tough love\" posturing you're talking about, unfortunately it's still on display in [the part of the website where they explain the rules](https://whole30.com/whole30-program-rules/): \n\n>**This is not hard.**\u00a0Fighting cancer is hard. Birthing a baby is hard. Losing a parent is hard. Drinking your coffee black. Is. Not. Hard. You have done harder things than this. It\u2019s only thirty days, and it\u2019s for the most important health cause on earth\u2014the only physical body you will ever have in this lifetime. Hear me now: The Whole30 is exactly as hard as you decide it\u2019s going to be, so repeat after me: \u201cThis is not hard.\u201d\n\nI decided to do the program because I need some kind of structure to switch to cleaner eating, but as soon as I read this statement I stiffened my resolve not to sink a dime into the W30 machine.", "Yes! Lots of things can be hard at the same time! It\u2019s not like there\u2019s only a limited number of things that can be hard and, once that label is used up, nothing else can be considered hard. It\u2019s a comparison trap and dismissive of people when they struggle with Whole30. Just because it isn\u2019t quitting heroin doesn\u2019t make it not hard.", "Over the years, I have come to see Melissa as a very flawed human being. The Whole30 program is amazing. She is not.", "whole 30 in itself is not hard. adapting to the changes necessary to pull it off can be VERY hard. which has to do with someones financial status, amount of free time, responsibilities outside themselves (children, jobs etc.), and access to resources. ive responded with such \"tough love\" to some people on this thread who are like \"its so hard to not eat chocolate\". fuck off with that shit. thats first world problems to a degree of complete absurdity. but if someone said \"its hard to keep this up because it presents so many logistical challenges\", id find encouraging words. but when someone says \"i need chocolate\", i tell them to check their priorities, or visit a doctor", "It\u2019s easy for me, but for a lot of people restrictive diets are hard. \n\nfor these people, every time they say no to a sweet or a cookie etc, their craving for that thing becomes that much stronger. Then they cave, and they beat themselves up, and they become discouraged, and they fall off the wagon. \n\nLike it or not, a lot of people have strong emotions tied to the food they eat. Just because it\u2019s easy for some of us doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for everyone.\n\nMy grandfather in law saw his father murdered, lost his wife, and lost 4 of his 10 kids in his lifetime. He made it through those things, but can\u2019t stop eating his daily chips-ahoy cookies every afternoon. That doesn\u2019t make him weak.", "I've been through some really hard stuff. And no, making a salad instead of a taco is not particularly hard objectively speaking, but going without most of my food-related emotional crutches is going to be hard. Doubly so during a pandemic when most of the other stress-relieving things that work for me are not possible, or not particularly safe. I'm going to have to find new ways to cope that aren't maladaptive and that actually work. That's going to be hard.", "YES! I just imagine them clapping at me between words. I read their website while I was doing my first round a few years ago and was very turned off by the shaming attitude around it. I get their point, but something about the way it was written was like, \u201cyou can do it, IDIOT\u201d. I like Whole30 a lot, it taught me to cook, and am trying it again. I just take their language and approach with a grain of salt.", "I can absolutely see why this phrase doesn't sit well with everyone. Personally, it works well for me. It gives me the mindset shift I need to be successful. For my food-addicted acquaintance who tried the program with me a few years back, though, this program was hard. \n\nBut this is where I'm torn. Even though I get why she struggled, because everything OP says about food is 100% true, this person ate pizza and pasta several times throughout, drank alcohol, refused to eat vegetables (except lots of white potatoes) and replaced them all with lots of very sweet fruit, then bragged on social media about completing the Whole30... before going on to complain that it didn't \"work\" and buying a bunch of detox teas and shakes. \n\nI minded my own business and said nothing because she 100% was not open to feedback. \"I'm doing Whole 30 MY way\" was her catchphrase that month. She turned down the book/website resources I offered her. I decided to just leave it alone. Not my business.\n\nSo I can't help but think that someone with their head jammed in the metaphorical sand is exactly who this brand of \"tough love\" is necessary for. And honestly, a LOT of people have this kind of attitude and are half-assed about making health changes. \n\nWhere I think this message misses the mark is with people who are ACTUALLY seeking to do the program, and finding it difficult for very valid reasons, like the ones described in this thread. It's absolutely possible to make a real, significant change and still find the diet overhaul challenging. \n\nI imagine this is especially true for people who aren't used to meal-prepping or having any dietary restrictions. (I already had two big ones so I'm used to being selective about what goes in my food.) Even as someone who typically cooks a lot, I got worn down with all the food prep and dishes. \n\nSo I can see it both ways, I guess. Some people really do need to be told to get over themselves and stop complaining. A lot of people don't, and those people are totally justified in finding the phrase insensitive and invalidating.", "It didn't bother me when I first started doing Whole30 (2013.) I liked the reframing of our dependency on junk food. No one needs to drink soda each day, but a lot of people do.\n\nBut as I've thought about it more, I've come to see that if you're coming from a place of privilege, it's easier to not be bothered by that phrase e.g. I work in an office (at home now) and even though I work long hours, I was able to plan ahead and make meals instead of grabbing whatever from a vending machine or deli. That is less hard than a lot of things in life.\n\nIf you can't afford to buy real food, it's a problem. For some people, Whole30 = Whole pay check, and that is hard.", "Hard, no. Challenging, yes. Does it give ppl something to complain about? Yes unfortunately. I do like this subreddit though, as I find it inspiring for new recipes, etc. Change is good."]}

However the eggs the recipes call for is actually 12 when you add them up. \n\nIt says you need 3 sweet potatoes but the recipes only incorporate two. \n\nIt also says I can coconut milk in the protein section and one jar coconut milk in the misc. section. \n\nIt has 1 head cauliflower (or 1 bag pre riced cauliflower ) in the produce section and again in the frozen section. \n\nIt says you need the coconut milk for smoothies or chia pudding, but  doesn't actually include the use of coconut milk in any of the recipes at all. \n\nThere might be more but I'm bored of looking, hah.

We have the power to choose how we want to live. We can choose to be kind or cruel. We can choose to be happy or miserable. We can choose to have a positive outlook or a negative one. We can choose to be healthy or unhealthy. No one makes those choices for us, we have to make them for ourselves. I can tell her that all day long, but if I don't live that way, she won't either. I told her these things because I want her to hold me to those standards.   \n\n\nI've realized that for me, whole 30 isn't about food or even really just about being healthy. It's about being more mindful of the choices that I make in all aspects of my life. It's about being an active participant in life and taking seriously the gift of free choice. ", "Good luck! It feels so good once you complete! And I had major cravings for bread the first three weeks but by the end I didn\u2019t even have a strong desire to reintroduce!

I hit day 30 2 days ago. It went by really quickly for me to be honest. Meal prep was not a problem, it just takes some advance planning and well times grocery runs to be sure that there is always good food available. \n\nWithin the first 10 days I definitely felt weak and tired.  I tried to exercise every few days, and I really struggled with my kettlebell and barbell training in terms of volume, weight and intensity. That is even after backing off on volume and weight. Peloton rides were similar, I struggled heavily with rides that I would routinely do and perform well on. \n\nBy day 15 or 16 that mostly subsided and my workouts improved back to where I would expect them to be for the most part. \n\nOverall my energy levels evened out, but I still find myself hitting a wall in some afternoons in the office compared to earlier whole30s where I did not have that problem. \n\nSleep has been great. With the exception of a few nights around day 17-20(ish) where I had trouble falling asleep at night, I have been falling asleep quickly and sleeping like a rock. The past week my Apple Watch tracker says I have averaged 3 minutes awake per night.  Average of 6h 59m asleep per night. (I got screwed up going to bed late twice this weekend due to social commitments).\n\nSpeaking of social commitments- I survived 3 pro baseball games, Labor Day lobster bake, fireworks, a 4 hour marathon fantasy sports draft, dinner with neighbors and a day at a pool club as guests of friends without breaking any whole30 rules.  Just thinking about the amount of terrible food and booze I avoided makes me happy. \n\nI suffer from low thyroid levels and I take daily medication for this.  I get my levels checked 2x a year and I just had blood work last week and my endocrinologist appt next week to go over the results. I am hoping that it shows that my levels are off - because I want that to be the reason I am not feeling 100% (still a bit tired, somewhat foggy on and off, cranky etc) because I hope that an adjustment to my medication levels will improve things.  My weight on the scale did not really change over the 30 days - the before and after pictures seem to tell a slightly different story.  But this also leads me to think my thyroid is off, because when if is, I gain and hold onto extra weight very easily.  On my first whole30 back in 2013, I dropped like 17 pounds.  Of course I was 9 years younger, and also starting at a higher weight. \n\nI reintroduced some dairy yesterday, no real ill effects aside from some slight feeling of bloat last night after dinner. Tomorrow I may try to have some grains and see how that goes. \n\nI am calling this day 32 for me because I plan to continue with strict Whole30 day by day for a little while longer (aside from some reintroduction of various things every few days) because I think that is what my body is telling me it needs.  \n\nOverall I think the best thing has been the restarting of good habits in terms of food shopping, meal prep, and what I choose to put into my mouth. Also my taste buds, real food tastes so much better now that I am not having my daily Diet Coke or ultra processed snacks. Also 32 days is the longest I have gone without booze in years. Feels really good. \n\nGood luck to all still on their Whole30 or planning to start one.", "You look incredible! Thanks for such a detailed breakdown of your experience, it really helps others out.

I also added half a large jalape\u00f1o, 6 cloves of minced garlic, and a healthy amount of compliant hot sauce to the mix (my mouth likes to be spicy). \n\nI doubled the dipping sauce recipe as well due to all the dumplings that I made. I didn\u2019t make any changes to the sauce because it\u2019s pretty fantastic on its own. \n\nFor those without a vegetable steamer, you can pan fry the dumps and they\u2019ll get nice and crispy on the outside. It however does take a while to cook the larger pieces. \n\nAll in all, this was surprisingly easy to make and very delicious. I thought it was going to be too cabbagey (if that makes sense?) but it was a good balance. Not sure what to pair this meal with for next time; maybe an Asian style coleslaw or salad? \n\nHere\u2019s the recipe; enjoy!\n[Pork Dumps](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsoooPyFZcW/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1cban33hnuyvd) ", "Damn it!

{"title": "Two Years Later: How Whole30 Changed My Life", "selftext": "Two years ago, [I wrote this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/3mzn9r/day_30_how_it_went_plus_nsfw_photos/) about completing my first w30. Since then, I've done two additional w30's and have been on the Paleo Diet non-stop, and I'm now at 165 lbs (after starting at 289 lbs).\n\n[Some relevant pictures](https://imgur.com/a/IkPqY) and [another set of relevant pictures](https://imgur.com/a/YHkMn).\n\nSome things I learned along the way.\n\n1. Go into your Whole30 with the mindset that you are changing your lifestyle and your relationship with food. This isn't a \"I'm going to lose a bunch of weight and then go back to eating like I used to\" diet. It's a way to reset your relationship with food, to learn about how your body responds to different foods, and it's a chance to wean yourself from sugar and grains.\n\n2. Change your habits. Following rules works only so far as you really analyze your eating habits and adjust to give yourself the best chance at good health. Weight loss is a bonus.\n\n3. While you're on your Whole30, if you are doing it to lose weight and/or to get healthy, really think about how you got to where you are at. I'm certain you didn't get heavy overnight; you won't fix this problem overnight. It will take time, and careful and deep contemplation. Only after you've identified the root cause of your eating issues can you really address the problem areas and make the necessary changes.\n\n4. Be strict. There is no such thing as a cheat day or a cheat meal. I call them sabotage. Cheating is when you gain an unfair advantage over an adversary or opponent. There is nothing to be gained by eating non-compliant foods. It's more like sabotage where you destroy any progress you've made and making it more difficult for future success.\n\n5. Change your perception: don't concentrate on what you can't eat, but focus on the great foods you CAN eat. Do I still love pizza, pasta, bread, and cake? Of course I do! But I have learned that there are so many Whole30 and Paleo compliant meals I can have instead that I never have to even consider the non-compliant foods. People are always surprised when I tell them the list of foods I can and do regularly eat includes things like sausage, BBQ, chicken wings, lobster, fish, etc (because the list goes on and on and on).\n\n6. Finally, but most importantly, perseverance. Change happens slowly. There will be times when you don't see any movement on the scale, or even see the numbers rise despite being good. Remember that the scale is but one of many data points that measure your health. The non-scale data is just as, and in many cases, much more important. Your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, liver enzymes, size, body fat percentage, etc. If I had a nickel for every time my weight went up while my waist size went down, I could buy lunch!\n\nWhole30 changed my life and my wife's life. I went from being obese to being fit enough to be in the National Guard at age 50. I run every other day, and my physical fitness test score was in the top 10% of the entire unit. My score was the top in my age group. I lost 110 lbs without doing a single step of exercise. I didn't start running until last September, joined the National Guard in February, and I'm now at 165 lbs. Together, my wife and I lost over 200 lbs in just over a year. That's amazing.\n\nI feel better, I have more energy, I am more flexible, and the best part: I am no longer diabetic, my liver enzymes are back to normal (I used to suffer from fatty liver disease), my vision has improved (as a result of my reduced blood sugar), my skin is better (less acne), and I no longer have nerve pain and circulation issues in my legs.\n\nIf you're on the fence about doing a Whole30, don't be. Do it. It's worth your life. The changes in my life since doing my first Whole30 has been incredible.\n\n[I started a blog](http://paleomarine.com) shortly after completing my first Whole30 and I have been answering questions ever since. I don't sell anything; to the contrary, I advise against pills, patches, powders, surgeries, and any products that promise weight loss.

That post seemed to be a helpful read for several people so I figured I'd post it here as well in case anyone is wondering how the hell to do a Whole30 on a shoestring budget.  Hope this is helpful for some of you (even if your budget isn't quite so tight!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not sure where you live, but if you're feeding only yourself it shouldn't be all that difficult to make $65 last for two weeks.  \n>  \n>Frozen meat and veggies are absolutely fine--just as nutritious as fresh and often a lot cheaper.\u00a0 If this was me trying to eat Whole30 compliant for two weeks on $65, this is what I would do--I live in a large midwestern city with a pretty low COL and I pulled all information from Kroger's and Fresh Thyme's (a natural-type grocery, kind of like Sprouts but not as pricey as Whole Foods) weekly ads and websites:  \n>  \n>Kroger:  \n>  \n>Split Chicken Pieces (I would get thighs here because that's my preference): $.99/per pound x 4 pounds = $3.96  \n>  \n>Ground Beef (80/20, sold in a 3lb roll): $6.57  \n>  \n>3 dozen eggs: 18 ct/$1.29 x 2 = $2.36  \n>  \n>25.5 ounce bottle of olive oil: $5.79 \\*\\*Note on this--I picked the big bottle to use for making a batch of mayo and also to use as cooking fat, but they have a smaller bottle ($2.69 for 8 ounces) if you were feeling up to making your own ghee for cooking fat--you can get a pound of butter for $2.99 and turn that into a BUNCH of ghee which would be cheaper ounce per ounce if you're willing to put in the time\\*\\*  \n>  \n>Simple Truth Organic Coconut Milk: $1.89  \n>  \n>Frozen broccoli: 12 oz bag/$1.00 x 2 = $2.00  \n>  \n>Frozen Brussels sprouts: 12 oz bag/$1.19 x 2 = $2.38  \n>  \n>Frozen spinach: 12 oz bag/$1.39  \n>  \n>Frozen 3 pepper and onion blend: 12 oz bag/$1.39  \n>  \n>Frozen cauliflower rice: 12 oz bag/$2.19  \n>  \n>Frozen Stir Fry Veggie Starter: 12 oz bag/$1.39  \n>  \n>**Total: $31.31**\u00a0if you get the bigger olive oil, $31.20\u00a0if you decide to make your own ghee for cooking fat (basically the same cost at the outset but a pound of butter will net a lot more ghee than the olive oil)  \n>  \n>Fresh Thyme (all fresh produce here):  \n>  \n>Avocado: $1.49  \n>  \n>Green Onions: $.50  \n>  \n>Radishes: $.69/bunch  \n>  \n>Tomatillos: $.99/pound\u00a0  \n>  \n>Sweet Potatoes: $.99/pound x 3 pounds = $2.97  \n>  \n>Russet Potatoes: 8 pound bag/$1.99  \n>  \n>Lemon: $.50  \n>  \n>Lime: $.50  \n>  \n>Baby carrots: $1.29/1 lb bag  \n>  \n>**Total here is $10.82**  \n>  \n>**Grand total for both places: $42.23**  \n>  \n>So, what I would do with these things:  \n>  \n>Toss the broccoli, carrots, and radishes in some of your cooking fat, garlic powder, and salt and roast at 425\\* for 20-25 minutes (until they're all crispy and delicious)  \n>  \n>Roast your Brussles sprouts in the same manor--you can even do them at the same time!  \n>  \n>I would recommend using half of each amount of the veggies each week just so they don't go bad before you can use them. The carrots and radishes should last just fine in your crisper for a week.  \n>  \n>Poke holes in 2-3 of your sweet potatoes and let them bake for awhile--baked sweet potato is an easy way to get some starchy veggies in with any of your meals, I usually have them alongside my breakfast but I always keep some in the fridge for when I'm feeling uninspired  \n>  \n>Dice up some of your regular potatoes and toss them in a cast iron skillet with some of your cooking fat and some of the pepper and onion mix--cover the pan so the potatoes will cook through and get nice and crispy on the bottom and you have an easy potato hash to pull on for the week.  \n>  \n>Take some of your frozen spinach and\u00a0some more of\u00a0the pepper and onion mix and cook until it's thawed, drain off some of the liquid, season with salt and pepper as desired, and then pour in 12-15 of your eggs scrambled up with a little bit of water.\u00a0 Put the whole skillet in the oven at 425\\* for 15-18 minutes until just browned around the edges and set in the middle--there's a week's worth of breakfast frittata.\u00a0 Do this again the next week--I have a veggie frittata with some baked sweet potato and topped with some sort of sauce or dressing for breakfast every day and it is amazing.  \n>  \n>Take half of your ground beef and just cook it in a pan with some neutral seasoning.\u00a0 Let it cool and freeze in individual bags so you can pull out and mix with cauliflower rice or stir fry veggies for some quick meals--I love taco seasoned meat with cauliflower rice and\u00a0some salsa verde (I'm getting there!) and put it inside a mostly-hollowed out sweet potato skin for a pseudo-burrito.  \n>  \n>Take the other half and make yourself some burger patties--freeze individually to pull out as quick \"emergency\" proteins. They'll go nicely with either kinds of your roasted veggies you made above.  \n>  \n>Take your olive oil, and egg, and some of the lemon juice and make a batch of homemade mayo. I like Everyday Maven's immersion blender recipe. That should last you close to the two weeks and will be amazing delicious plated fat to top your burgers.  \n>  \n>Take your avocado, half the can of coconut milk, and the juice from the lime along with some salt and mix that together (with your immersion blender if you have it) for an easy avocado sauce to top your breakfasts or anything kind of mexican-inspired.  \n>  \n>Take your tomatillos and chop roughly and then blend with salt and pepper--easy salsa verde.\u00a0 Take half of it and keep it for your sweet potato burritos, and put the other half in a slow cooker or dutch oven with some of your chicken thighs.  \n>  \n>Some more of your chicken thighs--get your cast iron skillet rocket hot, put in some cooking fat, and put the thighs skin side down for a few minutes to get them deliciously crisp. Salt the meat, flip the thighs over and reduce the heat to cook through.  \n>  \n>This list and meal prep directions should easily keep you well fed within your budget for the next two weeks.\u00a0 It's not always the most exciting food but it will be tasty, filling, and healthy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/bpfyqu/budget_whole30/", "created_utc": 1558030356.0, "score": 118, "author": "FoodYarnNerd", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/bpfyqu/budget_whole30/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Wow, fantastic, I love it.\n\nReally great job!", "I love your coconut-avocado sauce idea!

Arrange  a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Coat a  9x13-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.\n2. Trim  the top 1/2-inch from 6 large white onions. Cut the onions in half from  pole to pole. Peel and discard the outer papery layers from each half.  Carefully remove the inner layers of each onion half, leaving three  outer layers in place for the shell.\n3. Reserve the inner layers. Place the  scooped-out onions in the baking dish flat side up and cover tightly  with aluminum foil.\n4. Roast the onion shells until slightly softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the filling.\n5. Coarsely  chop 2 of the inner onion layers (about 1 cup total) and save the  remaining onions for another use. Place the chopped onion, 8 ounces  cremini mushrooms, and 2 garlic cloves in a food processor fitted with  the blade attachment. Pulse in 2-second bursts until finely chopped,  about 20 pulses.\n6. Thaw  1 package chopped spinach according to package directions if needed.  Squeeze all the excess moisture from the spinach with your hands. Remove  the casings from 1 pound Italian sausage if needed.\n7. Heat  1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat  until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden  spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes.\n8. Reduce  the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil,  chopped vegetables, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black  pepper.\n9. Cook, stirring occasionally until softened and the mushrooms  release their juices, about 8 minutes. Add the spinach, stir to combine,  and cook 2 minutes more.\n10. When  the onion shells are ready, evenly divide the sausage mixture among the  onions. Bake uncovered until the tops are golden-brown, about 20  minutes.\n\nPer serving\n\n(% daily value)\n\n* Calories 417\n* Fat 24.5 g (37.8%)\n* Saturated 6.7 g (33.3%)\n* Carbs 35.4 g (11.8%)\n* Fiber 7.0 g (27.8%)\n* Sugars 15.6 g\n* Protein 17.6 g (35.3%)\n* Sodium 769.4 mg (32.1%)", "I made this for dinner tonight, and my husband and I both strongly approve this recipe.

{"title": "R1D100 Thoughts", "selftext": "Well, I made it through 100 days of Whole30.  I never thought I\u2019d even make it through 10 really, but once I set my mind on it nothing was going to stop me.  At the end of day 30 I asked myself \u201cwhy stop?\u201d and, thus, I didn\u2019t.  Looking back on 100 days, including work trips to London, Chicago, and NYC, I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve achieved.\n\nMy secret?  I really don\u2019t mind eating the same thing over and over again, and I never got into the Feaux30 replacement foods (Whole30 Pizza! Whole30 Ranch!).  I understand some people need that to stay sane but I couldn\u2019t handle it, it just made me think of whatever I couldn\u2019t eat instead of enjoying what I was eating.  I\u2019ve stuck to some really simple recipes that I like and are good for me and I\u2019m happy.\n\nHow have I deviated?  I gave up coffee and most caffeine, because without dumping a load of sugar and cream into my coffee I just didn\u2019t enjoy it.  After about a week I didn\u2019t even notice a difference without the caffeine, and I went through 4-5 cups/day.  It was sugar I was addicted to, not caffeine.  For some reason I also tried to limit red meat.  I also weighed myself every single day.  For some people that\u2019s not good but for me it was essential.  Weight loss is a byproduct of Whole30, not the goal, but weighing myself daily kept me accountable and provided the motivation I needed to keep going.\n\nThe results?  Pretty amazing, really.  On January 2nd I weighed 296.6 pounds.  I\u2019m a powerlifter so I didn\u2019t look it but that number scared me, it was the most I ever weighed.  My blood pressure was good for my weight but still high.  This morning I weighed in at 238.1.  Blood pressure is fantastic, I\u2019ve lost five notches on my belt, and shirts that I never thought would fit again are now almost too big.\n\nMy encouragement?  Looking back on Day 5, Day 1 seemed the hardest.  Looking back on Day 10, Day 1-2 seemed the hardest.  Looking back on Day 100, the first ten days were the hardest.  It\u2019s always harder to start than it is to keep going.  Also, focus more on your intent than some of the rules.  If it\u2019s truly about breaking habits and resetting your relationship with food, don\u2019t anguish over the wrong type of lecithin your partner used to make dinner, your mind and intent were in the right place.  In the beginning I noticed some manic mindsets that were probably way more harmful than a secret gluten or sugar that snuck in somewhere.\n\nSo, when am I going to start reintroduction?  Dunno, I made it 100 days, why stop now?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/fz6v7z/r1d100_thoughts/", "created_utc": 1586616919.0, "score": 119, "author": "stainless13", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/fz6v7z/r1d100_thoughts/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["This is amazing!

{"title": "We did it! I am on day 31, my first Whole30 complete! Definitely not my last!", "selftext": "Husb and I just completed our first Whole30 yesterday! I figured I\u2019d put in our tips and lessons learned. \n\nAs a recap, I lost like 2 lbs. I ate too many nuts and snacked when I shouldn\u2019t have, even if they were Whole30 approved snacks. My main goal was to address food sensitivities so I did eliminate correctly, but I ate too much. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI don\u2019t know how much husb lost. I do know he was looking a bit thinner but he said some days he felt bloated and others he felt great. \n\nTips & lessons.\n\n* Don\u2019t let the first week overwhelm you. If you can make it through the first 10 days, you\u2019ve got it. The first week is definitely the hardest because you\u2019re still craving all your usual foods and not used to the new diet. It\u2019s also a lot of mental labor of meal planning and constantly trying to figure out what you can and cannot have. So much grocery shopping and trying to figure out whether or not something is okay. \n\n* Meal plan! I\u2019m usually a religious Plan to Eat user, but for this, I wasn\u2019t. For our next Whole30 (I\u2019m actually just full on eating whatever I want this weekend and starting R2 on Monday), I plan to meal plan a lot better. I think Plan to Eat stressed me out because so many of my meals were simple like homemade burgers and a fried egg + whatever veggie in the house. \n\n* keep simple things in your house. Make enough for leftovers. One thing that kept me successful was making breakfast sausage patties in bulk so I could just grab one or two with my breakfast in the morning. I also went to Whole Foods and found compliant andouille and chorizo and bought a few of them so I could use those. Breakfast is super important to me and having something I can make quickly with little thought was essential. Usually a hash with sweet potatoes and sausage and some eggs and avocado. \n\nAlso, I did hard boil eggs one night and I wish I would\u2019ve done more of that. It was great to throw two eggs in a bowl with some premade salad mix and celery and avocado and have an easy lunch. Being able to have lunch done in less than 3 minutes made it less stressful on days I would\u2019ve preferred to eat at a restaurant. \n\n* have someone who will legitimately commit with you. I had a full breakdown on day 10 and if my husband would\u2019ve quit with me, we would\u2019ve quit. But he didn\u2019t let me, so I kept going. \n\n* splurge a little. Obviously your grocery spending is gonna go up anyways, but add in some quality things you wouldn\u2019t normally buy. We ate a lot more steak and fresh fish (we live on a coast so we have a great fish market). It kept some variety and made things a bit better for us. \n\n* don\u2019t get overzealous and pin all these elaborate Whole30 recipes. Bunless burgers with a fried egg was our number one meal. I had pinned these chicken poppers and all this other stuff, but the simplicity of a meal was crucial to our success. You will be sick of cooking by day 5, so if you have something you can make easily, it won\u2019t wear you down as much. \n\n* don\u2019t try to substitute all your favourites. I know some people love cauliflower rice, but I hate it. Spaghetti squash may as well be SWYPO to me, because it\u2019s nothing like pasta. The first few days I was trying to make things taste like my grain favourites, and just kept getting disappointed. I was so much happier once I started making meals that were just actually Whole30 meals and not copycats of my favourite non Whole30 meals.\n\n* the unsweetened sauces and dressings you hated on day 2 are really good on day 12. I hated the primal kitchen ranch on the first day. I put it on my salad every day from day 12-18. We absolutely love unsweetened ketchup now. Your tastebuds just have to adjust.\n\nI didn\u2019t see all the crazy NSVs. I did a Whole30 to help my Crohn\u2019s and to get pregnant. It did neither, but it did help balance my hormones as someone who tracks ovulation. My Crohn\u2019s is kindof improving and I do think I have some sensitivities. Overall, I didn\u2019t repair my relationship with food which is why I\u2019m starting r2 on Monday and being more strict about the snacking and fruit, and I\u2019d like to lose like 10 pounds so I\u2019m gonna keep going. :) \n\nEdit to add update: husb and I just talked about it.

{"title": "If you eat when you're not hungry, you're distracting yourself from thoughts and emotions you don't want to aknowledge.", "selftext": "We are afraid of our thoughts and emotions. But what we don't see is that it isn\u2019t about them is about how we project them into a future scenario which makes them come into being.\n\nIn reality, I have discovered that there\u2019s nothing wrong with emotions. Having negative emotions isn\u2019t a problem, or that everything is over. Negative emotion mean we are forcing things to happen now, but we need to stick to the problem, and allow our minds to relax towards what happens, expose it to the problem, give it time to process it. When your mind is calm towards something instead of reactive, we will get what we want.\n\nAs Einstein says:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m so smart, it\u2019s just that I stick to problems longer than most people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a life-changing quote, if you understand it. Problem is when emotions bring us down, we believe is what is out there in the world but it isn\u2019t\u2026 Is in our attitudes, If you stick to the problem you get used to what is producing the emotion, therefore you don\u2019t create it again. When you stop creating negative emotions, your intentions surface and create inspiration therefore accomplishment, solutions.\n\nYou need to be aware of what is happening without escaping or distracting yourself from the emotion.\n\nIt may seem I\u2019m going off topic as it related to food and weight, but I\u2019m not. It isn\u2019t food why you eat, is not about the flavor, it\u2019s your problems, the things worrying you that make you want relief through food. You remember food all the time because life is not pleasing you in this moment. The solution is to stick to the problem and see what happens. Insight, happiness and calmness will come from there.\n\nPain is not why you don\u2019t workout habitually. Is because you worry and don\u2019t connect to your why. The pain is born out the lethargy and lack of ambition that you bring to your workouts. And why you\u2019re not ambitious? Same problem, you worry you escape your feelings and that makes them solid and robs you of your ability to be visionary and inspire yourself.\n\nTo deal with emotions, I recommend you to notice them in your body, see where they\u2019re located and meditate on them. At some point your mind will get stop thinking about it, and when that happens the emotion will go away, because negative emotions come when you react to things.\n\nYou can also take it slower and expose yourself to the emotions through 1 week every day, you will see they\u2019re considerably weaker each day.\n\nAnd a last very key insight, you need to focus only on the sensation, do not link it to any other problem you have in life. Every word or narrative you have is interpretation, and it depends on what emotion you\u2019re in, therefore they are all distortions. Focus only on the feeling and don\u2019t add words or images to it, but if that happens, no problem bring your attention back the sensation.

{"title": "Whole30 Jumped the shark?", "selftext": "I've eaten Whole30 \"clean\" over the last four years and have completed  12 strict 30 day compliance programs. The program is great but it seems that it has started to jump the shark over the last 24 months. When I first started out Whole30 was geared towards an elimination diet. The main point was to eliminate foods that potentially cause allergies and inflammation.  The program seems to have changed and be much more focused on intent as much as compliant foods.  Its no longer enough to comply with the ingredients you have to eat them in certain manner. Whole30 seems to be content not only to dictate what you eat but how you cook and consume it.  \n\nI cant cook whole30 compliant pancakes because they remind of a sugary food substance I used to eat? I cant drink V8 juice all though the ingredients are 100% compliant because someone determined the juice form isn't appropriate? I cant eat an RX bar because they remind me of a candy bar yet are 100% food compliant? There seems to be no rhyme or reason why one form of cooking and combining ingredient is compliant while another isn't. Why are Cauliflower mashed potatoes approved under these circumstances? They remind me of gooey yummy cream filled mashed potatoes...They should be non compliant, no? The famous whole30 turkey meatloaf reminds me of a meatloaf I get in a BBQ restaurant that is laden with fat and sugary BBQ sauce. Can I not eat the whole30 version?   \n\nWhat is the basis for restricting cooking and ingredient methodologies? The reality is that some people don't eat sweets and subsequently eating compliant/non compliant pancakes may have no effect while someone that doesn't eat sweets may have issues with mashed potatoes. Not everyone craves sweets or sugar and subsequently isolating things that may remind them of sweets would have no benefit to the program for that individual. To have a logical standard that covers all eating types the restriction should be whole food in their original and organic form.  \n\n\nOn the official forum the moderators often disagree amongst themselves and argue with the official stance of the program and no one can get a clear answer..I still love the food list and have found significant value in the program.

Chips aren't a trigger food for me.  The ingredients are still just 100% apples, and are totally compliant.  It just seems like these layers of rules get added in such a way as to facilitate gatekeeping and people claiming \"oh, you didn't really do Whole30 because you ate apple chips.\"  It really does seem to turn it into a big pissing contest of who can restrict themselves the most rather than the original intent of the program.  \n\nAnd it seems like so many of these rules aren't in the original plan as it's laid out in the book.

I understand why people are wary of too much soy in the diet, but the fact is eating whole foods including tofu and tempeh are relatively low in soy compared to the hidden soy in processed foods (in the form of lecithin and other additives) AND the amount of soy fed to poultry and beef which can affect human hormone levels as well.

In  a zip top bag, combine 1/4 cup of the olive oil, plus the lemon juice,  lemon zest, garlic, turmeric, salt, pepper, ginger and coriander. \n2. Firmly  close the top and shake to combine (or you can whisk everything  together in a large bowl). \n3. Add the chicken to the bag, close the top and  shake and massage to make sure the chicken is coated with marinade.  Place bag in the fridge for 2 hours or, ideally, overnight to allow the  chicken to marinate.\n4. Preheat the oven to 350F.\n5. Heat the remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil in a dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed oven-safe pot.\n6. Remove  the chicken from the marinade (do not throw away what is left of the  marinade) and fry it in the preheated oil just enough to brown each  side, but do not cook through. \n7. Remove the chicken from the pot and set  aside.\n8. Turn off the heat and deglaze the pan with the chicken stock.\n9. Return the chicken to the pan, along with the reserved marinade, and arrange the onions, olives and apricots among the chicken.\n10. Transfer  the entire pot into the preheated oven and bake for 20-40 minutes,  uncovered, until the juices run clear. Baking time will vary based on  the cut, size and thickness of your chicken.\n11. Serve immediately,  garnished with cilantro or flatleaf parsley, or store in an airtight  container in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n\n**Notes**\n\nYou  can use chicken breasts instead if you prefer, but these dry out more  easily, so watch them carefully to make sure they don't overcook. You  may also want to cover them for the first half of the cooking time to  help ensure they retain their moisture.", "This looks so yummy!

{"title": "Whole30 Changed my Life [link to gallery in text]", "selftext": "[Gallery of my Journey](http://imgur.com/a/YHkMn)\n\nI did my first Whole30 back in September 2015. At 5'7\", I weighed 290 lbs and was morbidly obese. I was told by my doctor that I was at a high risk for a stroke or heart attack. I was pre-diabetic and was being advised to take Metformin. My joints ached continuously, and I was unable to tie my own shoes without holding my breath; my stomach was so big, it crushed against my lungs when I bent over. I could never sit in a booth at any restaurant, and flying was an absolutely horrible experience for me and anyone unlucky enough to have a seat directly adjacent to my own. Forget about putting a tray table down.\n\nEnter my cousin and Whole30. She was never obese, but she was always battling her weight. After doing a Whole30, she not only lost weight, but learned about food and eating good, whole foods. As a PA, she told me that she agreed with my doctor, and that I was very unhealthy at my weight. I told her I wanted nothing to do with exercise and she replied with words I can still hear today; \"What if I told you that you can lose weight, get more energy, and be healthy again without exercise? You just have to change your diet for the rest of your life.\" She had my attention. I listened. I then read, read, and read some more. The more I read, the more convinced I was that this was the way for me to get into being healthy.\n\nAfter much deliberation, my wife decided to support and join me on my Whole30. With her help, we began. We had some tough times that first week, but afterward, it got easier. Much easier. By the end of it, we didn't know what to do, so we just continued with eating Whole30 compliant meals. We slowly transitioned into Paleo.\n\nI lost 20 lbs that first month and my wife lost 10. I went on to lose another 120 lbs total while my wife lost 65 lbs. We both feel much younger, have more energy, and our health issues have reversed. I am no longer pre-diabetic and my cholesterol levels are all normal. Even things like my wife's acne and eczema are gone!\n\nSince then, we've done one more Whole30 earlier this year. We did well, and while it didn't change much for me, it helped her kick a sweet habit she'd picked up. I did it along with her as moral support; I have, and still stay away from anything sweetened.\n\nWhole30 changed my life. I am now in the National Guard. I learned to hang glide, I zip lined, and I now run 3-4 miles at least three times a week. Oh, and I'm 49 years old.\n\nI recommend Whole30 to anyone who asks me how I did it. I tell them that eating right is the foundation on which good health and even fitness lies. Without eating right, you're on shaky ground and fighting the effects of sugar, grains, dairy, preservatives, pesticides, etc.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/63novg/whole30_changed_my_life_link_to_gallery_in_text/", "created_utc": 1491419365.0, "score": 102, "author": "Edge767", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/63novg/whole30_changed_my_life_link_to_gallery_in_text/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Wow, that's incredible!

I had acne like a teenager and raging PMDD. Earlier in the year I had lost 10 pounds, however I was stuck at the same weight for the rest of the year. Nothing I tried was working. \n\nOne of my friends posted on Facebook about the Whole30. She just completed her first round. She lost 15 pounds and said she felt her energy return to what it was in her early 20s. I was intrigued. I bought the book on my Kindle, and of course followed the instruction to read \"It Starts With Food\" first.\n\nI know the books state that the Whole30 isn't a weight loss diet. While that is my ultimate goal, the books made me realize that what I am eating is causing much more than weight gain. It's causing hormonal disruption, insulin resistance, etc. I felt that trying this lifestyle change may be the key to making me feel better. I was sick of being depressed. Sick of feeling disgusting and bloated after eating. Most of all, I was sick of being a sugar addict. \n\nOctober 9th was the start. I followed The Whole30 strictly for an entire month. \n\nBlack coffee became an every day thing. Eggs were my go-to breakfast food. I cooked meals at home every day and meal prepped like I never had before. I craved vegetables and fruit. I had my very first Halloween without any candy. I became creative with food and was never bored.\n\nMy energy went through the roof. My clothes were looser. My acne cleared up. My face became dewy and soft. I had zero PMDD symptoms when my monthly was due. I even saved $250 on my grocery bills since I wasn't going to restaurants.\n\nIn the end, I lost 14 pounds. \n\nI'm so thrilled. I feel like I finally have the proper template to turn my life around. It really does start with food.\n\nI didn't really have too many cravings during the 30 days. I was very focused and motivated. The \"tiger blood\" didn't hit me until Day 27, though.\n\nNow I'm working on reintroduction/getting through the holidays. I ate some cheese on Day 31 to start the reintroduction process, however feel like I'm just going to eat Whole 30 compliant other than on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Then I'll do another full 30 day round in January. \n\nAt this point, however... non-compliant foods really don't sound appealing to me. I like how I'm feeling. I'd rather feel energetic, light, and happy...rather than the sugar fog.\n\nMy life has changed thanks to a Facebook post.

This amazing family of seven (not including their dog) completely welcomed me and made a stressful situation that would normally have me in tears very easy to deal with. Over the course of the 2.5 hours they offered to feed me, and while the food was noncompliant, I had not eaten since lunch six hours prior, and I did not want to be a rude guest to these amazing strangers. I ate small portions to hold me over and today I am back on Whole30.\n\nBasically, I'm wondering what the community's thoughts are on this type of situation. Do I need to start my cycle over again?

During one of my whole30s I was volunteering at a search and rescue, the missing persons grandmother cooked us food and took a great deal of pride in giving us something to say thank you, for me to have turned down the food would have been a horrendous rejection of this woman and her desire to help in anyway she could.

A couple of days after going GF, I developed IBS. I was so noticeably linked to removing gluten though, because it was the only food group I removed. Maybe something similar has happened for you, but because it coincided with cutting out other foods, you can't tell. It did turn out to be a sign I was gluten intolerant and had my own autoimmune disease going on.", "I\u2019ve found that sometimes people accidentally go low carb on Whole30, which can impact energy levels.

I'd be happy to add to this discussion.\n\n1. You can have Larabars (or RXBARs, or dried fruit and nut bars) as long as the ingredients are compatible. This has always been the case! You are likely remembering my past rigidity in advocating for \"best practices\" on the Whole30, where I was somewhat militant about not using these as dessert or to satisfy sugar cravings. I meant well, and there comes a point in your elimination where I'd still invite you to consider where/how you're using these, especially if reducing cravings and changing emotional eating patterns is a goal. But in general, over the last decade I've taken a progressively more hands-off approach to micromanaging your Whole30. TL;DR: As long as you're eating compatible food, you're doing it right! And Larabars and the like can be a fantastic on-the-go snack or part of a mini-meal, and make for excellent fueling for activities like running or hiking. \n\n2. The Whole30 is not and will never be a \"lifestyle program\" which you'd adhere to on an ongoing basis. It's an elimination and reintroduction program. Reintroduction is a necessary part of the program, which is why it's now built right into the Program Rules. In the earliest days of Whole30, I did not made this clear enough. If you read the current website or The New Whole30, it's crystal-clear. \n\n3. As an elimination program, the balance here is tricky. We want to eliminate as many potentially problematic foods as possible, while still making the program accessible and sustainable for 30 days. As such, over the years as the research and our observations have evolved, if we discover a food previously included in the elimination phase is not likely to be as problematic as we once assumed, we'll bring it back in the program. We're not restricting just for the sake of restriction, and the broader we can make the diet during elimination WITHOUT compromising the end results, the easier it will be for people to complete it.  \n\n4. Licensing or expanding our Whole30 Approved partner list is not and will never play a role in the Program Rule changes. Each change since 2015 (when The Whole30 was published) has been documented with detailed explanations as to why this rule has changed, and in most recent years, the science to support it. You can find a summary of these rule changes in The New Whole30 and on our website. As an example, Kite Hill requested Whole30 Approved status when they first launched in 2017. We did not bring them on as an official partner until 2022, after an extensive period of time observing the way the Whole30 community used these dairy recreations. You can read more about that here: [https://whole30.com/article/kite-hill-is-whole30approved/](https://whole30.com/article/kite-hill-is-whole30approved/) I understand many (most?) business's decisions are money-driven. Capitalism! I've been lucky in that I've never had to decide between preserving the program's integrity and paying the bills. However, it's taken a decade-plus to earn the trust of the Whole30 community and establish our program as having a scientifici founding and said integrity. I'd not throw that away for any partner deal.\n\nI'm always open to questions of this nature, and will not take it personally if you are skeptical. I share in this community voluntarily because (a) the people here are wonderful, and (b) if I can offer background to help someone succeed with the program, I want to do that. \n\nThanks so much for the dialogue, everyone.

You know yourself best.", "Hi there! I suspect your Whole30 perceptions are coming from either (a) my oldest work/books, or (b) other people on the internet, although I can't remember a time where I've EVER discouraged someone from using fruit juice as a quick sugar source in your context! In addition, I assure you that we don't assign morality to food. Potato chips aren't \"bad\" or \"unhealthy.\" In the context of changing your habits and emotaional relationship with food, they simply function as \"food with no brakes\" for many, and replace vegetables and fruit on the plate. (You can read more about the Pancake Rule and why these foods are eliminated here: https://whole30.com/the-pancake-rule/). You can also read more about Whole30's role in diet culture/anti-diet culture in my latest book, The New Whole30. (Yes, I tackle this head-on.) \n\nIn the past, however (the earliest days, 2010-2015) I would have been more dogmatic about many things, including fruit juice. I have written, \"I'd rather you eat the fruit, given the health benefits found in the pulp and skin.\" But that has always been general advice for the general population, not medical advice! In your context, of course you'd use fruit juice (or anything else your doctor recommends) as a quick blood sugar regulator. And fruit juice has never been \"incompatible\" with the program, ever. \n\nI really hate that some people come to the program from my old material, which WAS more judgmental, more rigid, and lacked acknowledgment of my own privilege. I promise, I/we have evolved so much since then, and our current website and latest book (The New Whole30) both acknowledges that evolution and shares my current perspective. I think you'd like it far better, and I think it makes the program far more effective for many.\n\nFinally, you will find a LOT of Facebook groups and other communities online that have no association with Whole30, and do not reflect our current ethos, philosophy, or focus on accessibility. They may not even be current with our Program Rules! (This community is a notable exception; it's incredibly well-run and moderated, the mods stay up-to-date with all Whole30 happenings, and the people who share here are welcoming and encouraging.) In general, I'd recommend sticking to the source (Whole30's website, books, and social media feeds) for our official and current positions on topics.\n\nI hope you're able to find a copy of The New Whole30 at your local library, bookstore, or on Audible! I think you'll be pleased with our shift in tone, verbiage, and recommendations. In closing, always follow your doctor's recommendations, as they supercede Whole30 program rules. And please work closely with your doctor as you go through the Whole30, as the program can have a quick and powerful impact on blood sugar regulation, especially in your context.", "I think the thing to remember is that Whole30 is a short term elimination and reintroduction protocol and not specifically a diet or weight loss program. \n\nThat being said, you will reap what you sow. If you are having a lot of symptoms that can be traced to a food sensitivity, then strict adherence to the protocol is probably a wise idea. \n\nIf you find that your issue is more with the behavioral pitfalls associated with food, the pancake rule probably hits home a bit more than not eating cheese for a month. \n\nNo one is checking up on you to measure your adherence; I did one W30 strict and three Whole-ish 30ishs (currently in the midst of one where i enjoyed a piece of ice cream cake for one of my kids birthdays). Each time i came away with some different information about my eating habits and relationship with food.

I find it helpful to have a way to keep track of all of that, whether it is a google doc with recipe links or an actual folder with printed recipes, so that I can go back and be like, omg I love that thing and I haven\u2019t had it in forever!  That way all that knowledge I\u2019ve accumulated is easily accessible, and then when I\u2019m not doing a W30 and I don\u2019t have those guardrails in place, I can tell myself - ok I\u2019m going to eat this really delicious meal that I know I love and will fuel my brain and if I still want the chocolate cake after, then go for it.  \n\nAnother thing I have found helpful recently is focusing more on things that I hadn\u2019t thought much about previously when it comes to the way I feed myself.  I have been reading a lot about longevity and cognitive function, things that I wouldn't have thought twice about the first time I did a W30.  Knowing that I (39/F) am at midlife and the things I do now will have a direct impact on my quality of life as I age, is super motivating for me, in a way that other things never seemed to be. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever find a \u201dperfect\u201d version of my food freedom, but I do think as I get older, it is easier to let go of that idea.  I\u2019m still finding new things I like that are good for me and that nourish my body and brain, but I know this is a life long thing for me.  I have become much more forgiving of myself when I fall into bad habits which somehow seems to make it easier to pick myself back up.  For example, you mentioned 80s processed food - I LOVE Doritos.  I love them.  When I am hungry at the store, they literally call to me.  And sometimes I buy them and eat them.  And I used to beat myself up so bad afterwards, but now if I do buy them, I enjoy them and then I move on.  There is something about that mentality that makes me not want them as badly.  Before, I would binge the entire bag so fast I could barely taste them, then I\u2019d feel sick and I would hate myself.  Now, if I buy them it\u2019s not the same.  They don\u2019t have the same pull they used to.  This might sound stupid but I think I was giving the Doritos more power than I was giving myself.  I don\u2019t know if that makes sense but it feels true.  \n\nAnyway, not sure if any of that is helpful but I really just wanted to respond and say, I completely understand - and then it turned into this whole long thing.  But we have got this.  We have the power (not the Doritos!).", "I don\u2019t have real life experience or advice since I haven\u2019t found it yet. But on the short term, I found freedom in moderation. I\u2019ve been applying this rule of allowing myself to eat what I crave every once in a while in a \u201cfour bites\u201d rule. The first bite and the second bite are to enjoy. The third bite is to prepare for the fourth and final bite and then I put the treat away. I found that restricting myself completely does not work on the long run but allowing myself some items every few days is OK. I also don\u2019t buy processed food. If i\u2019m craving something sweet, I either bake it and freeze the batch or go to a caf\u00e9 and have a latte and share something with my daughter. I used to buy packs of donuts and cookies from the grocery stores and I don\u2019t anymore. If I have it in my house, I will eat it so I just avoid that.", "Food freedom is a moving target for me as well! I\u2019ve completed about 8 W30 and I always slide back into my old eating habits eventually\u2026 the past year I have been doing at least 2 proper strict W30 (and some up to 45 ish days) and once I notice I\u2019m completely slipped into my old ways (basically Thanksgiving and slowly sliding through Valentine\u2019s Day) I do another reset. I\u2019m back on right now. My goal is to eat whole30 foods most of the time and taking a day or so for holidays or special stuff and making sure I get right back on after a day or two. I know I feel best when I eat like this and save tons of money not eating out or junk food\u2014my husband loves the W30 food! Good luck with your journey!"]}

Once I let myself understand that if I\u2019m actually hungry, I will feed myself, that crazy starving feeling subsides.  I\u2018ve also noticed the super hungry feeling or feeling like I need to snack constantly is worse when my diet was particularly \u201cbad\u201d before I started the W30.  I do think there is a certain amount of just getting through that first week however you can.\n\nAnother big thing for me has been getting enough fiber.  I have the old W30 book so this may have changed in the new one, but I feel like it focuses a lot on protein & healthy fats (which are obviously super important).  The first few times I did W30 I was probably eating less fiber than I should have.  I think those three things (fiber, protein, healthy fats) together are the thing that is going to keep you full and satisfied longer.\n\nI recently read Jessie Inchauspe\u2019s books (she is the GlucoseGoddess on instagram) and I found them super helpful as a pretty easy explainer on how fiber works in our bodies.  One of her tricks is to start you meal with a veggie starter if possible and I think the easiest way to do that is to keep some compliant salad dressing on hand and some prepped lettuce.  We have been living off of this ginger dressing [https://unboundwellness.com/japanese-restaurant-style-ginger-dressing/](https://unboundwellness.com/japanese-restaurant-style-ginger-dressing/)\n\nIt is so good, it makes a big amount and I have found myself eating it with a spoon.  I dip veggies in it, honestly, just thinking about it is making me hungry.  If you don\u2019t like ginger dressing or don\u2019t want to make your own, there are a million recipes online for w30 Compliant dressings and there are so many more options now for things you can buy.\n\nGood luck!

My whole point of doing this diet is for the wake up call of stopping snacking so much and to see if I may have any intolerances or potential allergies, in short. \n\nMy diet before starting this journey is like many others, lots of boredom snacking, lots of easy and cheap meals: pastas, breads as sides or main course supplements, sauces, so much dairy, fast food every few days or so (I cook a lot already but very easy stuff), lots of sugary treats and cheese crackers, etc. not so many soft drinks or juices, I\u2019m good with my water. \n\nSo, I felt like I had a good foundation but of course the sugar/dairy/breads are the worst offenders here.

I wouldn\u2019t say this happens every day, but some days I\u2019m less tolerable to food than others. I\u2019ve always told myself that, sometimes, it\u2019s better to eat anything at all than to eat something I physically can\u2019t stomach. Which leads to sometimes things like ice cream being a meal, etc. I always try to force down things I don\u2019t want to eat. Again, sometimes it\u2019s food that I LIKE at the start of the meal and then it turns on me. \n\nI know this is mental, and part of my journey, but I\u2019m desperate. Ever since I started this diet, EVERYTHING gives me the ick. I have no safe foods to turn to. I am forcing myself to get enough calories right now but it is so much easier to think, maybe I won\u2019t eat at all. It takes me up to 30 minutes to finish a small meal some times because I\u2019m trying to force myself to eat it.

Look at the menu beforehand and look to see if there are elements you think can be separated, for example a piece of salmon or steak or chicken. Some vegetables can be added to that hopefully. After looking at the menu, call the restaurant and ask to speak to someone about the menu and your dietary restrictions. Ask if it's possible to get any plain proteins and vegetables, but regular seasonings are okay. Depending on the restaurant, your experience with whoever you talk to is going to vary, so please be understanding with this. Whether you get to speak to someone beforehand or not, make sure to closely communicate with the server at the beginning of your meal, before ordering, your current dietary restrictions. If they have trouble with the restrictions, at the very least explain to them you can do plain proteins and plain vegetables with olive oil and seasonings. And most importantly, be flexible and kind and understanding of their knowledge and limitations! Serving standards vary greatly from restaurant to restaurant and you won't have great luck with this in most places. At the end of the day, you'll have to be flexible enough that they may make mistakes and that you may eat something non-complaint; that is just a risk you take eating out with any dietary restriction.", "I think Mexican is easiest for this.

In my experience, going with a slab of protein (steak or piece of fish, etc) and the restaurant's version of steamed veggies is the most successful option. I've also had good luck with a stir fry type dish. The key is to talk to your server as soon as you can about it. Kindly explain what you're doing and what you can and can't have. Like bmore said, telling them plain protein and veggies with just oil and seasoning is okay and I usually start with that. Then I ask what other things on the menu could maybe be easily modified for you. Usually the server is really nice and says they'll ask the chef and I get something delicious and probably compliant. I always go in with a mindset of, \"I tried my best, and to the best of my knowledge it was compliant, so I'm good with that,\" even if I end up finding out something wasn't compliant. I've also done several W30s, though, and know how my body responds to a lot of the things W30 eliminates.

In the morning, I just pop a frozen cube into my lunch containers and microwave it at school.  It tasted as good as fresh. For weeknight dinners, I'll build a salad/bowl/plate with thawed proteins, roasted veggies, salad.  If I want to try a fun new whole 30 recipe, I'll save it for the weekend.  Each weekend I do pretty much the same meal prep- roast sweet potatoes, make a sauce/dressing, cut up lemons/limes for squeezing on everything, chop up fresh herbs for finishing.

Basically, I want to feel my best so I can accomplish all the things I want.", "I\u2019ve seen people mention (and I think it\u2019s mentioned in the book) to do a \u201csoft launch\u201d where for maybe a week or so before you\u2019re trying meals to see if you like them and so you have a base of some things you\u2019ll be able to do and how it will go so that when you start you aren\u2019t scrambling. \nI\u2019m doing my first round currently (today is day 10). The hardest thing to remove for me was cheese (dairy) and sugar - I\u2019m shocked to see sugar is literally in e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really \u201cmissing\u201d either because I\u2019ve found some easy and delish meals that are keeping me focused on the goals. \nI am wanting to shed some lbs but more so *really* for health reasons. I recently had a miscarriage and that has spurred on some weight gain even though I haven\u2019t really changed much in my diet. I did some blood tests and it showed I have a lot of inflammation in my body and even the drs are scratching their heads because everything else \u201clooks\u201d normal so I\u2019m wondering if I have some food sensitivities that are constantly causing the inflammation. I\u2019m loving how I\u2019m feeling and def have shed a few pounds already. \nHaving snacks like someone mentioned is key - really just fruits and veggies you can easily grab. \nI know you\u2019re starting next week - if you can make a couple meals before hand to get yourself in the swing of it. I don\u2019t want to buy a bunch of sub products so we\u2019re really doing simple meals which has been great. \nTwo so far that we LOVE: sausage, kale, potato soup (whole30.com) and garlic chicken sheet pan (wholefoodfor7.com) both are REALLY good. Otherwise we\u2019ve just thrown some meat (seasoned) and veg together for dinners which is easy enough.", "Plan your meals!! I asked ChatGPT to plan compliant meals for me based on my meat and vegetable preferences and calorie/macro goals, which worked great (as always with AI, check the work). \n\nThis might be a bit much for some, but I used a scale for the first week or so to make sure I was eating the amounts I thought I was - my portions were way smaller than what they should have been. I also had it analyze the diet for nutritional content and it recommended a few vitamins to me to supplement what I wasn\u2019t getting enough of. \n\nNow that I have a good meal schedule worked out (pretty much the same thing every day, just prepping cooked veggies a few times a week to microwave and add to whatever protein I\u2019m having for that meal), my next step is to actually track how much uncooked everything I need to buy for the week. I don\u2019t typically prep or cook super regularly (#girldinner) so this is new for me and a lot of work, but this system has helped a ton.", "Clean up and clean out. I throw away anything that isn\u2019t complaint the day before that won\u2019t be good after the 30 days, or anything I don\u2019t want to add right back into my diet. This goes for fridge, pantry, snack jars etc. \nAnything that isn\u2019t perishable, I bag up and store somewhere else. \n\nI am prepping/cooking food for my husband and I but still preparing meals for my 2 little kids, so I have to be really careful not to accidentally taste anything. I have been noticing if I keep a little area of clean paper towels around, helps me to remember to wipe my hands, not lick them lol", "Absolutely get your head in the game. If you are worried about messing up- move all your treats out of your line of sight ,ideally out of your cupboards, but I just told myself I can have anything from that shelf. Also plan for times when you\u2019re tired and hungry and need food now. Carry a Lara bar or Rx bar with you and have hard boiled eggs at the ready. Edited for fat fingers", "It\u2019s only 30\u2019days that you have to do the elimination diet. Then 10 days of whole 30 plus reintroducing food groups (carefully) or there\u2019s no point in doing it at all. \n\nAfter that you should pretty much stay on the Whole30 diet with foods reintroduced that don\u2019t bother you. That would be the whole goal is to have this become a long term habit for you. \n\nI\u2019d definitely read the book it helped me to understand the plan more and have faith in the process.", "I took 30 days to learn all about W30. I decided the foods I wanted to eat, found recipes and purchased all my substitutions, spices, herbs, oils. I planned menus, practiced a few recipes. \n\nOn day 1, I was ready. Or so I thought. I found out after meal prepping. I don't like 3+ days old food. I missed fast food. I was eating things I wasn't used to. So I picked the 3 meats I love. Hamburger, breakfast pork sausage, and salmon. So I recreated my favorite meals. Come to find out, most of the homemade foods I liked growing up and as an adult are basically W30. \n\nI am R1D15 now, the cravings stopped, and I get mad at myself for forgetting my avacado when I go to work! I am currently working on a fried chicken recipe  that is W30 compliant.\n\nGood luck and remember, like another redditor said. It is only 30 days, a looong 30 but only 30.", "I\u2019m R6D10 today. \n\nStay curious about how the flavor of foods change for you during the 30 days. I find a piece of fruit is so amazing tasting after getting rid of all that processed sugar. Savor. \n\nAlso, reframing is helpful. One of my favorite mantras is: you don\u2019t have to suffer on whole 30. There are so many creative recipes to try. Enjoy all the new dishes you get to cook up! \n\nGood luck!", "Me! I\u2019m stubborn. I completed 4 successful rounds but then\u2026for some reason\u2026the 5th time I tried, I just couldn\u2019t do it. It happens. Except I didn\u2019t restart, I just gave up. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f on my ACTUAL round 5 now. \n\nWhat makes it easiest for me personally to get through it is to make 5 servings of 3 different meals each week. My go-tos are shepherd\u2019s pie, egg salad, and a chili of some variety. I\u2019m a creature of habit so don\u2019t mind repeating some meals, but it gives me variety if I don\u2019t want the same thing for lunch every day (by the time dinner rolls around, I\u2019m good for a repeat lol). Inevitably I\u2019ll get a craving for something specific and make something totally out of left-field for dinner some days, which typically covers the rest of my meals. Failure is soooo easy when you have to worry about cooking EVERY MEAL EVERYDAY FOR 30 DAYS - what I call cooking fatigue hits me hard pretty quickly. Meal prep meal prep meal prep stuff that you don\u2019t mind eating on repeat. \ud83d\ude0a"]}

You're not far enough along to have a weekend of beignets, then take a day or two to recover and head straight back into elimination Day 24.

I also did it to try to clear up daily headaches and get off my sugar addiction, things like that. My weight gain started during COVID, so over a shorter period of time than you, but I added an extra 20-25. It didn't surprise me since my husband and I ate so badly then, but once things went back to normal I could get down maybe 10 pounds, but that was it. I tried to follow the healthy, slow, consistent methods of losing weight but nothing beyond the first 10 pounds ever happened. Whole30 gave me a complete reset. In those 30 days I lost 12 pounds below the threshold I had been stuck at and I basically kept it off, even through Halloween and Thanksgiving and nearly pulled off keeping it all off through new yrs. But the last two weeks of the year I ate nothing but cookies and had no time for exercise so I put on a quick 5. But that is still about 5 pounds under the weight I was stuck at for so long! Just started my R2 for new years and definitely already lost the extra pounds. \n\nSo as for the boosted metabolism, I essentially went back to my normal way of eating after my first W30 and kept the weight off. The habits I built in W30 helped for sure, though. I eat more fats than I used to and when I'm feeling like I need a reset, the meals I learned during my first round come back into rotation. I also got over some weird food or texture habits/preferences. I was pretty reliant on grains. Before W30 I would never eat eggs without toast. Or chili was always served with rice, chips, corn bread, or pasta dishes also had bread on the side, etc. While I still do all those things again now, it's not my default anymore. But the weight stayed off despite adding back grains and dairy and treats and so on! \n\nSo I totally understand how frustrating it is to be stuck at a certain weight but be doing everything right (like actually eating recommended servings of fruits/veggies, 80/20 or even 90/10 with the treats, perfect bloodwork) and have this feeling like if the extra weight could just disappear I'd be able to keep it off with what I'm already doing.", "I am on day 8 of whole30 and I am miserable.

First year was hard with all the cooking and damn coconut milk/cream in everything, but overall a good experience. Second year was better when I realized, there is a plethora of great recipes that need just simple modifications and are much more family-friendly. \n\nPart way through, three meals a day is a perfect fit, but at the beginning when your body is getting used to the changes, snacks are a must. Have them planned ahead of time, cuz when you're hungry, it is so hard to think of what to eat. Almond butter and apple slices is a solid afternoon snack at my house anyway, so that one carries over easy.\n\nEvery now and then I see people talking about lean meats and low-fat Whole30. But seriously F that. If it's what you want to do, then more power to you. For me, my body just feels truly awful without the healthy fats. This isn't an exercise to starve yourself. If you're hungry, eat. \n\nAlso, the absolute worst for me is being super hungry. I found out after R2 last year that I am hypoglycemia, and I had just been self-correcting with soda and sweet drinks my entire life. I learned a lot about my body last time. So when I get super hungry, sometimes a small glass of orange juice will help me stabilize. Maybe works for othe people, too.\n\nIn conclusion, don't try super hard to make weird food; plan ahead with snacks; don't get hungry.\n\n\n**Quick dinner ideas for when you actually are very hungry:\n\nGround beef patties w. Lettuce wrap buns (add approved BBQ sauce and grilled onions if feeling fancy)\n\nHot Dogs (there's a bunch that are whole 30 approved) and some frozen veggies tossed in the microwave \n\nDIY potato wedges with paprika and garlic (bake for 30 mins or so)\n\nSheet pan fajitas (slice up some chicken and bell peppers season and toss with LOTS of oil to add the fats, bake for 15 minutes)\n\n\nETA: I now try to stay away from \"copycat\" Whole30 recipes, as they're almost always disappointing. Meatloaf is simply not as good without breadcrumbs, and anything using coconut milk to replace milk/cream will end up tasting like a cross with Thai food. But a broccoli/beef stir fry with a new sauce can be really tasty, and strawberry basil chicken is delicious. Trying brand new things has been really fun for my family.", "If you have read the book when they talk about feeling like you have the flu it\u2019s so true.

I enjoy cooking, but I only want to do a few meals per week. I do an amount of meal prep (mostly veggies) and cook a few fresh things every day. Currently on my second round of Whole30, but I prep these foods all the time no matter what:\n- I cube a couple sweet potatoes and roast them in the air fryer for about 20 minutes and keep them in a the fridge all week so I can just microwave them to add a quick vegetable to a meal. \n- I also air fry a few green bell peppers and a few Yukon potatoes (usually cut them like potato wedges but whatever floats your boat)\n- I caramelize about 6 onions at the beginning of every week- adds tons of flavor to pretty much everything\n- I might make one big meal to get several out of. This week I did a 4-lb chuck roast with potatoes, celery, and carrots to make a good pot roast (just used extra seasoning and bone broth instead of red wine). I did this last Thursday and still will get at least one more day out of it- my partner and I have eaten it for at least one meal every day. \n-I also keep broccoli and spinach on hand to sautee\n\nFor my actual meals, I just cook up an egg, a salmon filet, or ground turkey and add my prepped veggies to it. I also really like Jennie O\u2019s sausage that comes in tubes to add to eggs in the morning. \n\nI have ADHD and get really overwhelmed by keeping on top of meals, so having meals available that take under ten minutes to cook is huge. I don\u2019t freeze them because I know I\u2019ll just eat a snack rather than defrost something.\n\nFor snacks, I keep egg white power curls on hand (yes, this is edging into potato chip territory, fight me)- they\u2019re available at whole foods and many local grocery stores; cinnamon applesauce cups; archer brand jerky sticks (I hate Chomps, all I can taste is the cherry), and a bit of dried fruit as long as there\u2019s no sugar added.\n\nGet really familiar with checking ingredients on absolutely everything, too. Sugar is hiding every damn where. This might sound asinine, but it also really helps me to schedule meals and snacks because lord knows I want to just snack ALL THE TIME.

Good luck!!", "honestly throwing things on a sheet pan and tossing in the oven will be your best friend. helps with the amount of cooking you'll be doing. I did my first whole 30 two years ago and being the worlds pickiest eater i was suffering. BUT it opened up my world to better foods, healthier lifestyle. sure, I've fallen off the wagon a bit in terms of my eating but doing whole 30 this time around feels waaaaaay easier to start because it's really just as simple as eating more fruits and veggies and proteins. not everything needs a cream sauce, not everything needs to be a big to-do. Just season up some protein, season up some veggies, and some potatoes, and you're golden. sure thatll get boring for everything, but it's a really great start", "Definitely figure out what you would want and can have as a quick grab when you're hungry, otherwise you might end up making bad decisions. I'm on the 2nd day of my first round in probably 6 or 7 years, so I had to think hard about this. Right now, I have turkey lunch meat, bananas and apples, nuts, and carrots with almond butter.

Go get the ingredients for success ahead of time. I always keep on hand coconut aminos, yellow bird sriracha, coconut milk and cream (both), olives, compliant mayonnaise, avocados, coconut oil, avocado oil, olive oil, and I usually have some compliant flour.

Add in shipping for a week and my subscription of 10 meals a week is about $150-$170 per week.  This is doable for my situation since it's just me and my husband. He can eat pretty much anything and has not joined me on the diet but will eat joint meals that we prep. I would not necessarily recommend using the service for families. The 'family style' portions are small. I tried it with a chicken entree and it was essentially 2 small breasts that had been prepared.\n\nDelivery on my orders has been $11. I am based on the east coast similar to where they ship my meals from so the location may play a factor in pricing. \n\nI recently found where you can get the same meals through what is a partner or parent company called 'territory'.

Lots of knowledgeable and helpful people here too!", "Hello fellow IBS lady! We have a lot in common, it\u2019s wild. I feel you on so many levels. IBS is a complex issue, certainly. The persistent bloating is an extremely frustrating part of it that I sympathize with, as is the discomfort you\u2019ve described. If it\u2019s of any interest to you, I might recommend seeking primary source literature about the brain-gut axis and the prevalence of pain in IBS. There\u2019s some scientific consensus that IBS sufferers have a more acute sense of visceral pain in the abdomen, associated with even what can be normal levels of post-prandial bloating. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t a condition that\u2019s affected so many aspects of my life, I\u2019d consider it fascinating from an academic perspective. If nothing else, there is validation to be found at least. \n\nI first did the low fodmap diet years ago when I was at my wits end. I\u2019m still on a modified low fodmap in some ways. The improvement, or rather better knowledge of my triggers, was helpful to a degree. Even with the low fodmap constraints, I still had plenty of pain and bloating, so I\u2019m sympathetic to your experience. I found that anxiety, esp. anticipatory anxiety could set me into a cycle of visceral pain. Rx Medications can also have a profound effect on gut behavior- motility, etc. including drugs where it is thought to be a \u201crare\u201d side effect\u2026 for some it feels not so rare. The most drastic change for me was getting off of an extended release med that I was a for YEARS with no idea it was destroying my normal gut motility. Switching from extended release to standard helped, changing drugs altogether helped even more. \n\nAs to how this diet overlaps or contradicts with the low fodmap: the major trigger I\u2019d watch out for in the whole30 compliant foods is excessive fruit and vegetables. Many low fodmap foods quickly become moderate or high fodmap when either \u201cstacked\u201d with each other or eaten in too large a quantity in one meal or adjacent meals. Some of my most noticeable triggers that are whole30 allowed: coconut cream, squash (esp zucchini, spaghetti squash, summer squash), dried fruit. \nEven eating too much chia seed pudding in a day can throw me for a loop lol \n\nLet me know if you want to chat! You sound like an absolutely awesome woman! Wishing you the best!", "Hello! I have IBS- D and completed my first W30 a few weeks ago. I did a food sensitivity test last year and found that I\u2019m sensitive to all dairy and most grains and never really did anything about it. I was excited to see how W30 would improve my symptoms. Once I got through the initial gas/bloating, my bloat magically went away and it happened quick (loved that). As far as IBS symptoms, well, I had diarrhea every single day. It was usually just one occurrence per day but in true IBS fashion, it was always very sudden and urgent. It was funny, I didn\u2019t have my first solid BM until I was on vacation last week and was eating/drinking pretty recklessly. \n\nBut at the end of 30 days, I was feeling and sleeping great, had no bloat, and even lost a few stubborn pounds I\u2019d been hanging onto. I saw a number on the scale I hadn\u2019t seen since before I got pregnant with my daughter back in 2020.\n\nIBS is a tricky guy and I\u2019ve never been able to truly pinpoint my trigger foods. My husband and I did our W30 knowing we wouldn\u2019t have time for reintroduction before vacation, and now that we\u2019re into the holidays we\u2019re kind of taking an 80/20 approach to things. Our cooked and prepped food is W30 compliant but we\u2019re also allowing ourselves to indulge in other foods. \n\nI want to do another strict W30 in January and a proper reintroduction to see if I can actually pinpoint the foods I react to.

{"title": "Reintro: struggling with bodily awareness and inconsistent reactions", "selftext": "I did Whole30 and it wasn't as hard as I expected to keep with the diet. I lost 5 pounds but other than that I didn't really notice much change. \n\nNon-gluten: this went fine it seemed. I had oats and quinoa. However a week later when I had oatmeal for breakfast, I had excruciating stomach pain, something was uncommon for me even before W30.  It could've been something else but I didn't record the prior day's food (I needed a break). So I don't have those data. \n\nSugar: made myself sick eating too much of something. Sugar gave me more of a mental reaction to feeling disgusted with myself. This was part of the reason I did W30 in the first place but apparently giving me back the option of sugar put me back in the same habit. I'll eat whatever I can get sometimes to the point of feeling awful, but then I'll eat some more to dull the feelings of shame. \n\nGluten: didn't notice anything too weird. Maybe soke bloating. I had a vegan, soy-free pizza and it was heavenly. \n\nDairy: I may have had a bit of acne afterward. I don't have dairy too often or in large quantities so I'm not sad about this\n\nBeans: mild pain and major gas. I'm not sure what to do about this because they're a cheap food that bulks up whatever meal they're part of. I may experiment with preparation methods or different varieties to reduce the side effects. \n\nOverall, my discouragement comes from two main things. \n\nFirst, I'd hoped this would immediately zero me into some specific food causing me trouble. It may indeed be the beans, but my fear is still that it's due to me overindulging and making myself \"bloated\" that way. There's no quick fix to that. I'm worried it's combos of things. \n\nSecond, I feel like I'm lacking the self-awareness to make really detailed observations. Nothing compared to some of the stuff I see here. I was really only looking at bloating, stomach pain, and gas. Sleep wasn't something I was tracking, neither was acne. And I wasn't tracking energy levels either. I'd say now that my diet has laxed I feel a bit more tired, but that could also be because my sleep schedule has been disrupted by the US time change and I'm sleeping later. \n\nIt feels like a bit of a waste to do this if I'm not properly equipped to parse the results of the experiment. I don't know how to track energy levels objectively because it depends on so much, including just my feelings. I hoped I would just feel amazing like people said, and then feel awful upon reintroduction, and not have to be so exhaustingly meticulous with tracking.

When I do the Whole 30 and when I've done keto-like diets (not that whole 30 is keto-like I just feel better on both diets) I feel better almost immediately, if not after a few days. When I do keto I'm charged with energy, I'm more regular, my skin looks better, I move better, my joints are less creaky. This time around I can notice small improvements--I'm able to think through meal planning and actually do it--but not the \"WOW! I feel great!\" I was hoping and expecting to have physically and cognitively.\n\nI've been eating a ton of veg consistently and haven't noticed improvements in regularity. My skin is purging. Movement has been hard for me.\n\nI guess I'm hoping for some insight and wondering if this has happened to anyone else.\n\nEdit to include **things I've done differently this time around that might have contributed to it feeling easier:**\n\nI've been keeping a **food journal** of what I've been eating--It's helped me find patterns and learn my preferences. For example, I've been eating a fruit w/ almond butter in the afternoon as a snack and I prefer to have at least 2 options for fruit for this meal so the following weeks I account for that when grocery prepping.\n\nI split the 30 days into 4 weeks and **I assign a type of cuisine per week**. I guess I reframed this as learning how to cook the dishes I like in a healthier way and grouping the recipes into the same week. Since the ingredients and flavors in one type of cuisine cross different meals, I can mix and match easier if the groceries I have fit the theme. (I'm not too strict on this). This way my meals also vary, and 4 is way less daunting to think of than 30.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1fzvqbv/not_feeling_as_great_on_this_round_of_whole_30_as/", "created_utc": 1728491730.0, "score": 10, "author": "vpostalvfricative", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1fzvqbv/not_feeling_as_great_on_this_round_of_whole_30_as/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I felt amazing on my first W30.

This is my second Whole30, my roommate and I did our first round two years ago - and started this one at the begining of September. \n\n5+ Years ago I struggled with overcoming an eating disorder. Had the tendency to starve myself, and would force myself to eat literally anything just to make sure food happend (usually toast, protein shakes, or whatever fast food my friends would force on me). I'm still trying to get out of the mindset of starving and binging, but it hasn't been a real problem until this week. I have had no appetite and have gone a couple of days now where I just eat the dinner roomate cooks because the effort for me to assemble a daytime W30 meal is too much, and the approved snacks sound nauseating. I'm struggling at work because I'm not getting enough protein to function. It's not the same W30 adjustment pains that I got last time, it's solely because I cannot make myself eat the options open to me. \n\n* For example the thought process for breakfast is:\n* I need to eat, but the sweet potato \"toast\" is too squishy.\n* Eggs take too much time, and are gross when premade. \n* Sausage is too much flavor, and bad texture\n* Bacon is too much effort to make every morning, too expensive to rely on\n* Potatos - I messed up with a rotten one last time I made them, and now I can't eat them becuase that's too gross\n* Fruit - last time I ate too much fruit it messed up my stomach so I don't want to eat that first thing in the morning\n* Salad - that's what we have for dinner a lot, cannot keep it fresh enough to bulk buy for all meals. \n* Smoothies - a lot of effort to make and clean, and too expensive to buy all the time\n* Lara bar - tired of them from last w30 and am sick at the thought of them.\n* Okay, never mind. I'll figure something out for lunch later on then.\n\n\n\nI don't want to quit W30, but I am debating changing it to a FODMAP elimination so that I can bring in some of my easy \"safe\" foods like pre-made Whey Protein shakes and rice cakes. I guess I'm needing some advice or validation. This doesn't quite feel like an official medical reason for me to quit W30 - it feels like I'm just \"too picky\" about foods to ignore the nausea and tough out whatever this mental block is. \n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1ffzgtk/editing_w30_to_deal_with_disordered_eating/", "created_utc": 1726246143.0, "score": 7, "author": "justagirlbehindadesk", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1ffzgtk/editing_w30_to_deal_with_disordered_eating/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I really don\u2019t think Whole30 is a good fit for someone in ED recovery!

If so, I\u2019ve found a lot of crossover between recipes that are compliant for both diets. If you can tolerate them, herbs and spices will be your best friends to make things more exciting. Scallions (green part only) are the best friend for fodies!

I sprinkle hemp seed over that, or add pumpkin seeds/chopped walnuts for extra oomph. \n\nOne word of caution- watch out for your fruit intake, as some low-fodmap fruits can quickly turn into high fodmap if you\u2019re consuming more than average on the whole30.

I could also offer a different perspective:\n\nWhat if you decided that your Whole30 was not FOR weight loss, but ONLY for identifying the foods that work best in your unique body. And that after elimination and a thorough reintroduction, you would take those learnings (so valuable!) and apply them to a different, new, sustainable weight-loss focused approach. And thanks to your Whole30 learnings, you\u2019ll be able to reduce or completely avoid inflammation, bloating, digestive upset, disrupted sleep, energy crashes, and other factors that can get in the way of your weight loss. Which actually makes your Whole30 the perfect step to take BEFORE you conscientiously start working towards weight loss?\n\nYou could do that now, if you like. Reframe your Whole30 immediately, such that if the scale shows no difference, that isn\u2019t a negative, because *that was not actually the goal of your Whole30.*", "I just started back!

If getting on the scale tomorrow is going to be too difficult and possibly lead you to undo all the great stuff you've done over the last 30 days.... don't get on the scale.

You don't need to let that negativity in your life. \u2764\ufe0f", "I am considerably overweight as well. I did my first hole 30 in 2014 and I generally do not lose weight on Whole30 but I sure do you feel a whole lot better.

Whenever I go to Europe I eat whatever I want, the dairy, the gluten, the wine, and I feel great and lose weight.\nI'll be interested to know how you feel in a couple weeks.", "I\u2019m in the USA and currently on the Whole 30 diet (about one more week left before the reintroduction phase). It\u2019s a limitation diet to clean out the gut from common irritants and allergies (dairy, gluten, etc); therefore could feel better on it.  But, going through the reintroduction phase to find out what food groups give you negative symptoms will be just as important as the first 30 days. Once you know what foods cause your symptoms you\u2019ll hopefully feel better avoiding them.\n\n I am doing this through my naturopathic doctor and she recommended not getting whole 30 approved food deliveries or similar. Focusing on eating Whole Foods and making it from home is the best approach.\n\nBiggest recommendation is make it simple! I had the \u201cReal Plan\u201d app that whole 30 recommended and the problem with it is, the grocery list got long and expensive because of all the ingredients I needed and didn\u2019t have laying around. So after the first week, I decided to do a simple approach that was more time efficient and financially better. My doctor also has me space my meals 3-5hrs apart, so I eat a big meal every 5 hours rather than snacking in between. She also recommended eating a fruit after every meal to help the sweet craving (it does help!).\nExample:\n9am- scrambled eggs mixed with onion, green pepper and spinach with avocado, bacon (whole 30 approved), steamed carrots, and an apple\n2pm- grilled chicken, salad (lettuce, tomato, green pepper, onion, cucumber, olive oil, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar), cashew nuts, banana and strawberries\n7pm- grilled chicken, same salad with avocado, steamed mixed veggies, grapes and strawberries. \n\nThe simpler you make it, the easier it is and the less stressful it is. I recommend trying not to eat out because it is stressful and hard to do. But, if you do, preferred places would be where you can request dairy free and gluten free. Like ordering streak and request dairy free so butter is not used. I see many people recommend ordering salad, but dressings can have added sugars which is a no go, so bring your own if you can or request oil and vinegar is it\u2019s available. No fast food obviously even if you can order \u201cgrilled chicken\u201d.\nIt will be hard to say no to things that others are eating in front of you. You will start to have dreams that you ate cookies and you wake up panicked thinking you failed your diet (haha it will happen!). \nIt gets easier as the days go by and you start to appreciate how you feel, it makes you want to continue the journey. \nWhen looking for things at the grocery store, keep a list of the \u201cno\u201d ingredients that you can refer back to. Anything with \u201cadded sugar\u201d is an automatic no, just as anything with peanut oil, etc. \nI also recommend planning and preparing ahead of time to help ease the load and save time. If you work, prep all your meals  3 days at a time, that way it\u2019s just grab and go. \n\nI hope this was helpful, being someone going through it currently. It really is a learning curve at first."]}

{"title": "R1D26 - things I've learned so far", "selftext": "A non-exhaustive list of things I've learned so far:\n\n  \n**1) To cook.** \n\nLike, I'd never really used an oven! Now in my mid/late 30s, my zero-cooking had become quirky part of my identity. But I am learning to cook! Nothing fancy, I have zero desire to host dinner parties (unless others bring the food), but I understand how to buy raw ingredients and turn them into edible meals and that's a huge change for me.\n\n  \n**2) I enjoy herbal tea.** \n\nI've always been a coffee fiend. I drink it black, and the fact that coffee was limitlessly allowed was a big factor in my even daring to try W30. But even I have caffeine limits and so I bought a bunch of herbal teas and found they cut the cravings and were very satisfying. I'm getting into tea! (the Pukka Echinacea +  Elderberry is my favorite).\n\n  \n**3) I don't need as much caffeine**\n\nBy drinking all these teas, I began to realize maybe I didn't need that 3p cup of coffee. Or even that late morning cup of coffee. And while the diet is not meant to tackle caffeine addictions, I'm down to one cup of caffeinated coffee a day. If I want a second, I'll have decaf. This is so wildly unexpected! \n\n  \n**4) Cashew butter is crack** \n\nI could eat it like ice cream. I don't, because I am aware of it, but I could. It's absolutely delicious. For real, this could become a food with no breaks for me. \n\n  \n**5) I've craved diet soda over any other single item**\n\nWhich surprised me and also made me really not want to drink diet soda anymore. It made me realize how hooked on it I was!\n\n  \n**6) I can have club soda and lime with friends at a bar and it's not that weird**\n\nI was super worried about this. And when I first started, I got a couple of \"oh you're not pregnant, are you?\" when I told friends I wasn't drinking (some of my friends are a rough crowd, lol). But it was actually fine. At this point the bartender at my regular spot now knows I'm off the rum and cokes and serves me my club soda. I will go back to drinking, but I know that I can curb it and switch and it's not a big deal.\n\n  \n**7) Too much spinach will turn your poop green \ud83d\ude43**\n\nAnd too much tomato sauce can turn your poop red. \n\n  \n**8) I can do this alone.**\n\nI started doing W30 with my boyfriend. I felt confidence knowing I'd have an ally and that he could help me, since he cooked and I didn't. But then, as life would have it, we broke up halfway through the round (not related to the diet!), and by then I was already doing most of my own prep and found I can be my own cheerleader and I was even able to resist the temptation to indulge in wine or consolation food because it means a lot to me to finish this round.\n\n  \n**9) I have generalized anxiety**\n\nOne of the major reasons I started the diet was all these testimonials about \"tiger blood\" and all this energy and better sleep. I have trouble sleeping, I often feel sluggish, and even though I have a naturally slow heart, I'd sometimes feel my heart race increase, especially at night or in the early mornings. I attributed this last bit to drinking: I don't binge drink, but between social meet ups and hobbies, I'd regularly drink 4 nights out of the week. \n\n  \nWell, I learned my poor sleep and sluggishness were not caused by a poor diet, and my occasional elevated heart rate was not due to drinking.

{"title": "Food Freedom instead of a round in September?", "selftext": "Hi everyone! I did my first Whole30 about 5 or 6 years ago and pinpointed my sensitivities.  I then leaned into a paleo/sometimes Primal way of eating for the most part and felt great. In that time up until now we had the pandemic, plus I got married and had general life stress (my dog passing away, moving, getting a new puppy) which caused me to stray from my healthy eating at times (sometimes for a longer time than I liked!) and I also never really practiced sticking closely to whole30/paleo/primal while \u201cout in the wild\u201d, only at home. I used social situations for my 20% of 80/20 after everything reopened from the pandemic and we\u2019ve been slowly exploring new restaurants since we moved.  I\u2019m currently dealing with some new health issues which are causing me to really want to lean into anti inflammatory eating more often than not (potential lean PCOS- no insulin resistance or anything like that, just cysts on my ovaries and pelvic pain with some pins and needles feelings down my legs). My appointments to confirm this are the week the September Whole30 starts, and I\u2019m also starting physical therapy the following week. Since my initial appointment a month ago that found the cysts (they were watching to see if they would dissolve, I don\u2019t think they are), I\u2019ve been using the Food Freedom questions when I have cravings or we go out, since more often than not it hasn\u2019t been worth eating the food since it causes severe bloating and excessive pressure on my pelvis and pelvic nerves (I\u2019m also dealing with SIBO I suspect). I could do another round, but mentally and physically I don\u2019t think I have the energy, and my physical symptoms are causing me to actively choose cleaner eating and avoid cravings anyway. I also wanted to be able to have the chance to practice choosing better options when we do go somewhere without having to start over or panic if there\u2019s not a compliant option, and just choose the healthiest option available since stress makes all of this worse. Is anyone using the month to focus on leaning into their food freedom and making this a true lifestyle?

The original was so simple, and it\u2019s only 30 days not a lifestyle change.", "I\u2019ve been waiting for this convo! Let me clear up just a few things.\n\n1. We changed our stance on seed oils because the science demanded it. Full stop! The point of any elimination diet is to eliminate as few foods as possible while bringing maximum success to participants. The science clearly does not demonstrate that seed oils are inherently problematic enough to eliminate them during the Whole30. (Case in point, I found no other credible elimination diet, from Harvard to Cleveland Clinic, from the IFM to Today\u2019s Dietitian, which eliminates seed oils when evaluating food sensitivities.)\n\n2. As a result of this science-backed shift, the program DOES become more accessible, as some of these oils are more budget-friendly. However, wanting to make the program \u201ceasier\u201d played no role in any of these rule changes. It\u2019s simply a byproduct.\n\n3. This rule change won\u2019t have much impact on your grocery shopping, as the program still eliminates added sugar, grains, and dairy\u2014which form the basis of 99% of ultra-processed foods. It\u2019s not like all of a sudden you can have Twinkies or Doritos on the program, or even conventional salad dressings (sugar). It DOES mean that people cooking at home can saut\u00e9 their ground chicken with Brussels, asparagus, and cauliflower rice in canola or rice bran oil if they choose. (If someone wants to claim that meal is \u201ctoxic\u201d because of the seed oil, we clearly have different understandings of the science.)\n\n4. As for claims that this decision was money-driven, what you think of my motivations is not my business. But as of today, we have zero MSG partners or partner products, and have taken zero dollars in MSG-related sponsorships\u2014and that rule changed in 2021. (I was also accused of \u201cdoing it for the money\u201d back then.) I\u2019ll also tell you that if I WAS gonna sell out, I\u2019d bring red wine, dark chocolate, or non-gluten grains back into the program. Any of those would have WAY more upside for me, and could be way easier to justify\u2014just sayin. \ud83d\ude02\n\nFeel free to ask further questions here, or save it for the AMA!", "Live your life, man.", "My husband is incredibly allergic to peanuts. BUT, peanut oil doesn't do anything to him. Chik fil a uses peanut oil to cook their food, and they don't need to disclose it as an allergen. From what I understand, peanut oil is refined in such a way that that protein that people are allergic to is removed.\n\nBecause of this, I wasn't concerned at all when they allowed seed oils. it's purely an experience thing for me, knowing that they're refined in such a way that they're not even considered \"allergens\" anymore. If studies have shown that people just don't have allergies to the oils, but that they still might to the foods that are used to create them, I'm grateful to have it added back in.", "Getting seed oils out of diet years ago was the thing I saw the biggest impact on my daily health and well-being. I had not heard of Whole 30 at time (many middle of the nights reading online journals and buying used textbooks), but started using Paleo, Whole 30, etc recipes later for convenience at times. I searched for this because I have friend who has been doing Whole 30 with nutritionist for close to month without relief for issues was saw him purchasing chicken with veg oil prep and I was confused. \n\nOne of the reasons I don\u2019t follow \u2018programs\u2019 is that it can feel very arbitrary at times (if xylitol is Paleo, anything is possible).

I'm AVIDLY following this thread and welcome all feedback.   \n  \nOne thing I'll point out is that this book is the update to The Whole30, which was published in 2015. \\*Compared to that book\\*, there are a LOT of changes to the program rules. (Eight, to be exact.) They include coconut aminos, botanical extracts, peas, MSG, updates to the Pancake Rule language, carrageenan, sulfites, and cooking oils.\n\nIf you've been reading the Whole30 website for years, many of these won't be new rule changes to YOU. (There is a section in the book on page 29 that goes through these changes and calls out what year they were made.) But compared to 2015's The Whole30, these are ALL rule changes. We'll be rolling out these changes in details with supporting articles in the next two weeks; we wanted the book to have a chance to breathe first.\n\nCompared to The Whole30, you'll also find dramatic shifts in (a) how I position reintroduction (as part of the Whole30, not some separate effort *after* the Whole30), (b) how I define and talk about Food Freedom, (c) my recommendations around smoothies and snacking, (d) how I talk about Whole30 and weight loss, (e) how I talk about doing the Whole30 with kids, and (f) how I talk about Whole30 in the context of diet culture and eating disorders, to name a few.\n\nSome of these topics are brand-new to this book, but again, if you've been watching the Whole30 website and newsletter over the last three months, you may have seen this content \"teased\" in our articles, emails, and social media. It's all still *new* *to this book*, though.\n\nFinally, while the Plant-Based Whole30 has been in place since 2022, it exists in full in this book for the first time in print, and the Plant-Based recipes included are all new.\n\nHope that helps to provide a bit more context for why I've talked about how much really is \"new\" in this book, whether you find the changes dramatic, mid, or somewhere in between.", "I\u2019ve done a proper Whole30 a few times.  It\u2019s good to do at least once for the educational value of how much crap is in packaged foods.  Health wise, I\u2019ve always kind of felt like you\u2019re going to get the bulk of the benefit from eliminating the big things: added sugar, alcohol, gluten/refined grain, dairy.  The elimination of minutia like carageenan, the noncompliant oils, the small amount of dextrose on rotisserie chicken, etc is only a small % optimization but makes it a lot harder for people to stay compliant.  So I\u2019m a fan of any loosening of the rules on the small things.", "I think opening the oils and additives (sulfites and carrageenan\u00a0) restrictions is a way to widen their ability to license the Whole30 approval to grocery items.

I say this as a fan of Whole30, but it seems the money grab is likely higher for the licensing than a new book.", "I\u2019m disappointed. There\u2019s so much emerging about the oils.

There are a bunch of changes. I think the biggest one is that all cooking oils are allowed no matter what the source. So that means that soybean oil can be used, corn oil can be used, peanut oil, etc. That does not mean that soy products, coin products or peanut products other than oils can be used. Also sulfites are now allowed and carrageenan is now allowed. I think that's most of it. The reintroduction section in the book is outstanding. It really goes into more depth and I really like it a lot. They also made it clearer that there is a pancake rule but there is also a scale rule and if you blow the scale rule that you do need to start over. There are other things but I don't recall all of them. It is worth buying the book in my opinion.", "I bought the new book for access to PB resources as i\u2019m primarily lacto-ovo-pescatarian in my food freedom, so a normal W30 with beef and bacon and the such wouldn\u2019t feel good to me. \n\nI am pleasantly surprised with the new recipes on either side. I was always underwhelmed by the recipes of previous W30 cookbooks, so i am eager to try these! \n\nI am also so very happy to support someone who has shown growth in her own journey, which is what this book celebrates, so I acknowledge her accomplishments and what they motivate me to do by buying the books with her name on it (not \u201cnew\u201d name, not \u201cpreferred\u201d name - her identity). \n\nYes, the new rules were marketed as a reason to buy, which those are nice to have access to, but i knew they\u2019d be available for free eventually. The new \u201crules\u201d emphasize inclusion of different societal/cultural norms that were left out before. I love that. The new guiding principles of W30 really kickstart the food freedom mindset. Think about it- rules, restrictions, and shame about messing up don\u2019t seem like the most solid of foundations for getting to food freedom. The New W30 introduces a gentler side to self-exploration and discipline: boundaried in a clear and kind way - this is the Melissa Urban way \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAs a PS- For those struggling with the new W30 conceptually, change is hard. Consider reflecting on that more, internally, prior to shouting a cynical reaction publicly you may not agree with in the future. What are these feelings about? Where are they stemming from? How are they serving you? If you still have criticism to share, do so, just make sure it\u2019s thoughtful.", "I have the new book. Legumes including chick peas are not allowed (unless plant based).

It\u2019s supposed to be an elimination diet for a reason. If you\u2019re doing it because you have real digestive issues and not just food habits that need breaking, you should probably stick to the OG W30. If you\u2019ve done W30 fourteen times and know your foods without breaks, your hang ups, you know certain foods don\u2019t bother you or set off an inflammatory response in your body - literally go for it.

Here are my tips: \n\n- The first 5 days are an adjustment. You might feel extra tired, sore, bloated, brain foggy, etc. Give yourself some grace. Go to bed early if you can, skip the gym, don\u2019t agree to any stressful social outings. I go through crazy mood swings the first couple days and have trouble sleeping so for that short period, I become a hermit with an insanely early bedtime. But it really only lasts 5 days, sometimes even less.\n- Remove non-compliant foods from your environment or at least put them out of reach.\n- Carry W30 snacks with you at all times. The great thing about W30 is that the meals are really satisfying and keep you full until your next meal, but if you don\u2019t have that next meal ready to go, when hunger strikes it becomes an emergency. And how often do we find ourselves working late or stuck in line at the grocery store? Meat sticks, nuts, dried fruit are all great options to have on hand.\n- Fat is your friend. Adding olives, avocados, or nuts to your meals will ensure you are eating balanced meals and getting enough fuel. Same goes for carbs. Don\u2019t be afraid to add potatoes or fruit to a meal. \n- Think of your triggers and create a plan for how you will stay on track when they inevitably come up. You might not even realize how much of a role certain foods/drinks play in your life until you are at that birthday party, happy hour or baseball game surrounded by temptation. What will you eat or drink instead? How will you distract yourself? Will you explain to the host why you\u2019re turning down wine and cake or will a \u201cno, thank you\u201d suffice?           \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to find the root cause of your discomfort, at the very least you\u2019ll have a good set of data to take to a doctor or nutritionist should the issue continue. Best of luck!", "Meal plan easy, throw together meals for those nights your brain thinks ordering something would be easier. Sheet pan meals, meal prep & reheat, etc. \n\nAlso eating within the Whole30 rules doesn't have to be boring. You can make & eat some truly delicious dinners that don't make you miss the things you've eliminated.", "I'm starting on the 12th! I'm hoping to get some answers re: bloating, etc, as well. Hopefully, others chime in with advice! I tried it once 10 years ago, but I only got to Day 11 before calling it quits. This time, I'm trying to do my research and set myself up for success.", "Eat more than you think you need to at each meal - it\u2019s an adjustment moving to healthier (often) lower calorie food so you need more volume. You don\u2019t want to get caught hungry and unprepared between meals or while out and about. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about calories or carbs or any of the typical focal points of fad diets, just start by giving your body whole/compliant foods and the rest you can sort out over time. \n\nDont worry too much about making new/fancy recipes - stick with meat veggies and fruits with some fat. \n\nEat leftovers for breakfast.\n\nDont force yourself to eat things you don\u2019t like. \n\nMy first round I did all these things and I was floored with how much my body composition changed for the better. Not to mention I felt amazing and so proud of myself! \n\nGood luck you\u2019ve got this!!", "I\u2019m starting the 14th! We got this!", "Totally agree with some others to carry snacks with you when you head out. I\u2019ve been saved a few times by a bag of pistachios and an RX bar!", "My biggest tip is to plan for more food than you need. Really \u2014 do this. Make sure you have extra snacks that are shelf-stable on hand. Leave a snack or two in your car, at work, etc. You never know when hunger will strike! Another good suggestion is to double batch your proteins. I made these turkey meatballs from the Whole30 cookbook (I think it was \u201cFast & Slow\u201d) and they were a big hit. I really liked them. I made sure to make extras so I could put a few meatballs onto my plate with a veggie, fat and carb source. It made meal planning so much easier! Lastly, don\u2019t be at all afraid to use shortcuts for meals. Get pre-cut veggies, buy hard boiled eggs ready to go, etc. You want to make the prep for Whole30 as easy as possible. Don\u2019t overcomplicate it."]}

I've been eating Amylu chicken sausage links, Aidell's chicken apple sausage, and Greenridge farm beefsticks in addition to beef, chicken and pork that I prepare. I use Primal Kitchen mayo and ketchup combined with Claussen's kosher pickles to make a burger sauce. Tessamae salad dressings are W30 compliant. I like their habanero ranch and lemon garlic dressing. I use coconut milk and Primal Kitchen mayo, add onion powder, garlic powder, Himalayan salt, dill, parsley, and pepper to make my own ranch. I used to make dump ranch but even with acidity, I don't want to eat raw eggs. I drink chicken bone broth and water with lime when cravings hit. I miss my diet soda so to treat myself, I'll drink a small bottle of sparkling apple juice or add a small can of pineapple juice to sparkling water. I prep pico de gallo to add to salads (tomatoes, onion, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalape\u00f1o), grill a tri tip roast and several chicken breasts (skinless, tenderized), seasoned with Tony Chacheres Spice & Herbs Creole seasoning. I roast beets and sweet potatoes and keep them chopped, ready to serve. Hard boiled eggs. I use these for meals throughout the week. I might have some steak with avocado and pico de gallo with spring mix and dressing. Chicken breast, avocado, tomatoes with sweet potatoes and fruit on the side. Hard boiled eggs, apples and almond butter for breakfast or have sausages with grilled onions and peppers or sauteed kale or spinach. Steamed artichokes with Primal kitchen mayo are good. Snap peas dipped in guacamole are very satisfying. Pork rinds are compliant but I only use these occasionally, to add crunch to taco salad. Not good to mindlessly snack on them. Brewed Cacao with coconut milk is really good if you don't like unsweetened coffee. For fruit, I have apples and berries or melons. The melons help increase water content we consume. The apples and berries provide fiber. This is all I can think of for now. Hope this helps someone have an easier time getting through these 30 days.

I got so tired with looking in the mirror and hating what I saw. I still have a long way to go but I found what has worked for me so far is to severely limit any \u201cbad foods\u201d in my diet. I didn\u2019t beat myself up over not being perfect over these past 30 days because that wasn\u2019t the goal.

If that isn\u2019t accessible (which is often the case), remember that arthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition\u2014and many are autoimmune in nature; you don\u2019t say whether yours is or not. You may simply need longer in the elimination phase to see if the protocol is going to help reduce your inflammation or improve your symptoms. The three-week mark tends to be the time frame when symptoms get worse or more stubborn before they get better, when it comes to AI conditions. And you still have a full 1/3 of the program to go! \n\nI know it can be frustrating, but if you are willing to be patient and see the full 30 days through, you may in fact start to see see positive results. At the very least, you\u2019ll then be able to re-introduce carefully and systematically, and see if any of the reintroduction food groups clearly make your symptoms worse. (Many people don\u2019t notice that they are feeling better until they reintroduce and symptoms come back in full force.) \n\nAt the very least, if you complete the program as written, you\u2019ll be able to share that with your general practitioner or healthcare provider, who can then rule out this \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d and craft a treatment plan from there.", "I was just about to say part of what Melissa said in her comment here.

And I think it is a great start to get an understanding. But whole 30 in actuality is not a good elimination diet. Good elimination diets to get some sort of credible results last much longer, and should be done with the help of a professional.\n\nSo like you, I started this to get some kind of a hint. But to me, it sounds like either this is not a good way to find a solution to your problems and maybe you should consider a different, more medically accurate elimination diet to really test if there are foods that cause you pain/elevate pain levels. \n\nI know if my stomach pain worsened or did not improve at all by day 20, I would not continue.

In the past I was able to make exercise and addiction, but due to a few changes in my life, it's not as convenient to get into that zone. I'm working on my thinking patterns and that might change.

Well I just finished w30 4 days ago and here\u2019s what happed this time around. \nI didn\u2019t reach for sweets, alcohol, or pasta/bread. In fact the only thing I miss is a dash maple syrup on my sweet potato breakfast mash.\n\nSince I did true w30 already and had no need of learning about food sensitivities when reintroducing \u201cregular \u201c food back. I felt like I could allow one thing and that was Greek yogurt. \nI allowed Greek yogurt 2% for breakfast or a few scoops to help add protein before/after the gym.

I started at 144 and made it to 130 this morning.\n\nI have to say the look on my personal trainers face was priceless when she saw my body scan results. That\u2019s when I told her about what foods I cut out and for how long.\nI don\u2019t know if the Greek yogurt had anything to do with helping me kick the cravings or the fact that I don\u2019t want to ruin all my hard work.

Again I feel like it was because of my emphasis on protein intake. \nI\u2019m very happy to continue to make better food decisions because I\u2019m results driven now. W30 has proven to be the best shock diet for me. \n\nBit of health background I will add is 1.5 years ago I was told I was pre-diabetic and have not any feelings of low blood sugar since w30. I\u2019m going to get my blood tested to see how I\u2019m doing with that. Would love to pull out of pre-diabetes and fix my pancreas.\n\nLastly in 2021, after w30, I had blood tests done with results thay I developed high cholesterol. I attributed it to eating bacon almost everyday for whole 30. That was why I allowed Greek yogurt this go around. \n\nThanks for reading!

It sounds like you've learned more about yourself. Thank you for sharing! Do you also have PCOS? It can cause a metabolic syndrome with prediabetes and high cholesterol. I have this myself. \nThis is my 3rd time doing W30. I lost about 10 pounds during each of my prior Whole 30s. I got very sick following my first one after introducing gluten. Bloated, got extremely constipated, broke out in a rash on my face that refused to clear. For the longest time, I couldn't tell if it was potatoes or gluten. I ended up on antibiotics to clear what turned out to be dermatitis herpetiformis and some sort of intestinal infection. Drank kombucha daily and took digestive enzymes to heal up. Anyway, it was painful to eat for a couple of months after that whole 30. I know I have a gluten issue. Every time I bring it back in, I get really depressed, swollen, achy, and have joint pain. Same with alcohol and sugar. My 2nd Whole 30 I kept gluten, alcohol and sugar out for about a year and then completely relapsed on a cruise fell into COVID lockdown, moved away from my gym, became a sad sack and never got back to healthier eating after, kept drinking. Adding dairy after my 2nd W30 definitely boosted my satiety and helped with performance for working out. I'm so grateful I can do dairy after this, because it's my toughest craving here on day 14! I was in excellent shape within three months of starting my last whole 30 because it was such a jumpstart to mindful eating. This time is a reset to go back to no gluten, alcohol, or added sugars. Haven't decided what I want to do about artificial sweetener yet as most of the protein shakes I enjoy are artificially sweetened and I don't think I want to give up Diet Pepsi for good. I'm really getting tired of meat and eggs right now and miss cottage cheese, greek yogurt and oatmeal. I almost talked myself into using butter today and won that battle without doing it. Forced myself to eat some chicken sausage, a couple of bites of sweet potato and some olives for dinner. Tomorrow is halfway there!"]}

{"title": "Using ChatGPT for Meal Planning", "selftext": "Hey Whole30 friends. I have done 8 or more rounds of Whole 30 starting in 2015 and have hit food freedom and then fallen back to old habits and am looking to find my food freedom balance again. I prefer to cook whole30 at home, but lately between grocery costs, how I want to spend my time, and just life - I've really found myself pushing the easy button and eating foods that are quick in the moment, but tank my energy and mental health. Maybe this is old news, but I'm blown away by how much ChatGPT has helped the hurdle for me in terms of meal planning. Here are the questions I asked to simplify my meal planning and I hope this helps you too! \n\nP.S. I live in the south and it is humid and hot and all I want to do is eat a bunch of salads right now. Hence the way I framed my first question :) but you can do whatever you want - You could say, using the following proteins/ingredients (and include what's in your fridge already)\n\n  \n;TLDR I'm tired and I'm letting ChatGPT take the mental load off for eating healthy. \n\n1. Can you create a whole 30 meal plan for one week that includes fresh salads and seasonal ingredients using recipes from the following blogs; The Real Food Dieticians, The Defined Dish, Whole Food for 7, No Crumbs Left, and Paleo Running Momma. Please include links to all of the recipes. \n\n2. Then it gave me a different breakfast and lunch option and I usually prep these for the whole week so I really only need one option: I can eat the same breakfast and lunch all week. Please use the BLT Chicken Salad for Lunch this week and the Sweet Potato Breakfast Casserole for breakfast.\n\n3. Can you create a shopping list for this meal plan including how much of each ingredient is needed?\n\n4. I have 2 hours to meal prep for the week on Sunday. Can you create a plan to get as much prepped as possible before the week starts?\n\n  \nI did all of this in less than 15 minutes. You can always ask ChatGPT to remove or replace recipes if they don't sound appealing to you or you could choose the recipes and then put that into ChatGPT and still use the bot to create the shopping list and meal prep plan. I hope this helps someone the way it is helping me! Let me know if you have fun geeking out over it, too! \n\nETA: I noticed that sometimes the recipes recommended are no longer on the web since ChatGPT does rely on old data.

The term \"emergency food\" is synonymous with \"on the go food\" in the Whole30 lexicon. It doesn't mean \"only eat during emergencies,\" it means \"these foods are portable, easy to eat, and perfect for travel, errands, or when you have a need for convenience.\" It certainly doesn't mean you can ONLY eat them during emergencies.\n\n  \nLarabars have virtually no protein, so though they do contain some healthy fats, they're not ideal as a meal. RXBARs have some protein (from egg whites), but again, they're *very* light, and don't offer much in the way of fiber, vitamins, or minerals either (compared to a whole food-based meal). For context, both are about 200 calories in a serving, which isn't much if that's one of your 3-4 \"meals\" a day.  \n  \nIf that's your whole meal, I hope you're making up those protein and calorie needs in your *other* meals--otherwise you'll be greatly under-eating, and your energy, sleep, cravings, etc. will suffer. But there are no rules about our meal template, serving sizes, portions, etc. so if you eat an RXBAR every day for lunch, you'll be perfectly Whole30 compatible.", "I think W30 is more about noticing habits as opposed to necessarily having to break all of them. For me, I was hooked on diet cokes with meals and replaced them with plain seltzer water. I figured out that I don\u2019t need the cola flavor, I just genuinely enjoy the sensory experience of having a fizzy beverage with a meal. I drink seltzer every day now (and savor the occasional dc) and I think that\u2019s just fine. \n\nI think the protein bar habit could be fine for you or it could not be. It depends on the nutrition of the bar and why you\u2019re eating them. Maybe you experiment with having Lara/rxbars or not having them and be really mindful of the sensations in your thoughts, emotions, and body. Assess. \n\nAlso, I think they\u2019re listed as emergency only because dates are as close to a sugar fix as you can get on W30 and that can be problematic to some peoples goals on the program. I had one or two before workouts a few times and found that they were counterproductive to my needs (they were feeding my sugar dragon and I found myself literally licking my lips craving them)\n\nThis whole thing is an experiment and all about self determination. Only you can decide whether or not a food habit is problematic for you.", "I allow myself to eat them as more than an \"emergency food\". Same as you, I don't like to eat too much during the day and will have them as lunch or mid afternoon and then have a big supper. They don't make me want more sugar or trigger anything.

They are mostly just dates and nuts, but RX has some eggwhites thrown in. I wouldn't use them as meal replacements.

Just my two cents.", "Its not the worst thing in the world but its not super good for your body, u should try to insert some healthy snacks in your daily routine", "Most bars (including most Lara bars) aren't allowed.

All of the recipes I\u2019ve made of hers have been super simple. \n\nI\u2019m on Day 1 and haven\u2019t done whole30 in about 6 years, but here are a few things that have gotten me through multiple rounds:\n\n1) Rotisserie chicken - when you get home, take 10 minutes to take the meat off the bones while it\u2019s still warm and put it in a freezer bag. This was you can take off a chunk of already-cooked meat and just heat quickly in a skillet or microwave (skillet will taste better).\n\nPair this with whatever veggies, fruit, sauce, etc. \n\n2) Frozen veggies - put your serving in a bowl with a little water and microwave for a couple minutes. Season and you\u2019re done. \n\n3) Pre-make things like potato and squash, then after they\u2019re cooked, put in a freezer bag for quick meals. You don\u2019t need to thaw them out first, just cook in skillet for a few minutes and they\u2019re ready (don\u2019t recommend microwave for potatoes, it\u2019s like reheating fries lol)\n\n4) Stir fry - I buy a bag of frozen mixed stir fry veggies, then I make a stir fry with frozen rotisserie chicken, frozen veggies, and coconut aminos. Sometimes I get fancy and add a little sesame oil too. You can top with sesame seeds or cashews, then green onions and serve over frozen cauli rice (thawed out for a minute or two in microwave). Super easy and basically no prep other than chopping up the green onions. I recommend taking out the chicken from the freezer the day before you want to make it, but it can be thawed out slowly in the pan too. \n\nIf you want a bit more flavor, I suggest trying with chicken thighs, ground pork, or even doing a Thai basil beef version with ground beef. Lots of flavor combos. \n\nIf you want a little crunch for the chicken or other meat, sprinkling in some arrowroot powder once the meat is cooked through (or coating chicken and cooking it while coated) does wonders. \n\n5) Soup - this one has a little more prep when making it, but if you make a bigger batch, you can eat it for 3-4 days. You can also freeze most soups. I like making chicken and veggie types. Again with rotisserie chicken. Veggies: onion, carrots, celery, potatoes, cauli rice, peas, bell peppers, plus spinach, kale or similar at the end. \nBroth, then coconut milk if you want it creamy. \nSeason with whatever you like. Garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning is a safe bet. \n\n6) hard boiled eggs - I make half a carton at a time and put them in a sealed container in the fridge. If I\u2019m feeling lazy, sometimes I\u2019ll just eat a couple eggs and an apple or some other fruit. \n\n7) deli wraps - get some butter lettuce, w30 deli meat, and some veggies like avocado, bell peppers, carrots, cucumber, etc and roll up. You could also add some nori paper if you want to make it like sushi in a way. \n\nLastly, what helps me too is focus more on protein(meat/eggs)+carb(fruit/veggies)+fat(avocado/coconut/olives/nuts/etc) and make it enough to fill me up.\n\nYou got this \u270c\ufe0f", "I do Greek chicken and lemon potatoes (:\n\nhttps://www.foodbymaria.com/greek-chicken/", "Salmon fillet and choice of vegetable. I used thawed frozen fillets and usually a frozen vegetable too. Prepping and cooking the salmon and veggie from start to finish takes about 30-45 min plus thaw time but it only uses a few dishes to make and is pretty easy to execute. Sometimes I will bake more fillets at a time to have some leftover. \n\nBaked chicken, some part of the dark meat is my preference, in a roasting pan over root vegetables and any other veggies of your choice. I like sweet potato, parsnip, beets, mushrooms, celery, and carrots. I used whatever seasoning blend I want and use it for the veggies and chicken. Oil and lightly season veg first then place chicken on roasting rack over the veg and oil and season the chicken. Bake for 30-60 minutes depending on your over and cook preference at around 425F. Literally all it takes is a cutting board, knife, and roasting pan. This meal takes about 30 minutes to prep. This can yield a lot of servings and be good for leftovers/prepping. \n\nSimple Truth rotisserie chicken from Kroger is also a super easy way to get your protein and just add whatever side you want!", "Lunch meat or microwave a sausage, half an avocado with bagel seasoning, and carrot sticks.

{"title": "Day 5 of no electricity", "selftext": "We had a storm on Tuesday and have been without power since then. I had prepped my lunches for the week on Monday and took all of that to the office on Wednesday so I would at least be able to salvage that. We put what we could in a cooler with ice and had to throw out a bunch of stuff I couldn't eat anyway (no big loss there). I'm also excited that the fridge is empty for a deep cleaning. \n\nHowever, we've had to eat out for dinner every night and I'm frustrated that every single restaurant is Dallas (that has power) puts bread or wheat flour and sugar in literally every single menu item. You can't even get a decent salad that isn't drenched in non compliant oil and sugar for some reason. \n\nTuesday Night I somehow managed to find a grocery store running on emergency power (no refrigerated items) and grabbed some blueberries, a grapefruit, some sugar free jerky and the driest pork rinds imaginable. \n\nLast night we had bbq (no sauce for me), but the seasoning 100% had sugar in it. My stomach hasn't forgiven me yet. \n\nI had an idea for a restaurant called \"... Spice and Everything Nice\".

{"title": "Day 30 Tomorrow - Some Observations", "selftext": "Just finishing up my first round of whole30. I started this diet because I was having some digestion issues and I felt like I was squeezing into my pants. Just generally felt gross and wanted to take control of what I put into my body. Some background - I\u2019ve always eaten healthy (not a fan of soft drinks, junk food, limited dairy.) and am already quite thin so I wasn\u2019t doing this to lose weight. I started to note some things in my personal notes app but decided to do it here in case it was helpful for anyone. \n\n- sugar is in EVERYTHING. Why? It\u2019s seriously such a problem and it makes me sad that we have to deal with this so much as American consumers. I didn\u2019t realize it was in things like broth, hot sauce, dressing, etc etc. Now I feel like a more conscious shopper, like I have the choice to be more picky about what I buy, even if it\u2019s more expensive to buy the healthy version (again, WHY?!).\n\n- I feel less inflamed, which I heard was a thing but I was skeptical. Even my TMJ symptoms were less noticeable. \n\n- I still had digestion problems. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve identified the culprit as being high FODMAP veggies, specifically broccoli and beets. I had a horrible time after eating both of those things (on separate days) and had to take probiotics to get me regulated again. It was not fun - gas, extreme bloating, etc. I\u2019m extremely sensitive to garlic and onions, so I avoided those on whole30. On days that I didn\u2019t have these issues (more toward the beginning of my whole30) my digestion was great! Regular bowel movements and no bloating.\n\n- I got my period twice \ud83d\ude20 - the first cycle came a few weeks early, two weeks into my whole30, and the second cycle came a few weeks after that. The first cycle I had virtually no symptoms, but the second cycle I felt SUPER tired and lethargic and had my usual symptoms - bloating, gas, lethargy, and night sweats for like 3-4 days leading up to it. I had a very regular cycle before starting this diet so I hope I go back to normal. \n\n- cooking almost every single day is SO ANNOYING. I was better at prepping in the beginning since it was new and I was more excited about it, and now it feels like a chore.\n\n- because of my period coming twice, my energy levels and mood have not been consistent. I\u2019ve had days where I feel super energized and happy, and other days where I feel like crap - not like myself. Some family members have even commented that I seem down. This might have something to do with my period coming twice, so it\u2019s hard to really piece apart my symptoms when I\u2019ve had to deal with that. \n\n- my skin has been the same, to be honest - I still get these random rashes on my arm, and a pimple or two on my face.\n\n- best change - I can fit into my pants comfortably again!!! I generally feel more confident wearing my clothes; one pair of jeans specifically, didn\u2019t look too great on me before and now I love how they look. So that\u2019s a win!\n\n- overall, I really like being more conscious about what I eat, showing myself that I can control what I put on my body, to make sure it\u2019s something nutritious and healthy. I think I\u2019ll definitely adopt some diet changes like limiting sugar and dairy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1d27wl9/day_30_tomorrow_some_observations/", "created_utc": 1716860060.0, "score": 22, "author": "chiliboots", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1d27wl9/day_30_tomorrow_some_observations/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

I\u2019m a weirdo perhaps but I really enjoyed building meals off of Whole Foods only and appreciating much more variety. Ironically, I learned NOT to restrict myself- it was freeing to eat what I wanted so long as they were Whole Foods and not to calorie count.

This is probably due to the amount of exercise I do. \n\nI suspect, too, that my low level inflammation has improved, although I won\u2019t know for sure until my next bloodwork scheduled in July. \n\nBefore starting the Whole30, my diet included whole fat Greek yogurt with 1/2 cup of bran buds (I have diverticulosis) daily, moderate sugar consumption, moderate grains, and 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks per day.\n\nOn the Whole30 we\u2019ve been eating lots of fruits and veggies, eggs, fermented foods, meat, chicken, and fish. \n\nSo, my question to you: what eliminated food group do you suspect is the largest likely contributor to my results. \n\nThanks all!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/1cvnjlr/question_about_my_results_to_date/", "created_utc": 1716122958.0, "score": 10, "author": "Muted-Run9812", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/whole30/comments/1cvnjlr/question_about_my_results_to_date/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Sugar.

Willpower Boost: Saying no to tempting treats like alcoholic drinks and sugary desserts has been surprisingly empowering.\n3. Healthy Habits: I'm developing better eating habits, exploring the science of food, and discovering delicious new recipes for healthy snacking.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Persistent Bloating: Despite my efforts, I'm still dealing with bloating and stomach issues, especially since being diagnosed with post-infectious IBS after having Covid. \n2. Calorie Intake Challenges: It's tough to strike the right balance of calories without overdoing it on fat, which can be hard to digest and leads to gassiness, especially combined with all the veggies.

You have had a process of relearning patterns of thought, the whole30 helped you become more aware of yourself and your desires. Trust that, trust the process, trust yourself. I am sure that you have done a lot of effort to be where you are right now. Human beings are scared of uncertainty, it makes us feel like we are stepping into the unknown and we don't know what is going to happen, of course we get scared.  \nYou have done an economical effort to be where you are, to choose differently what you buy when going grocery shopping. This is an investment on yourself. Be thankful for it because that means that you are taking care of yourself and of your family.  \nAfter the whole30 is over, it doesn't mean that you have to go back to the same nutrition decisions you were having before. If you are more aware of your body, listen to what makes it feel better or worse. Give your body enough nutritious healthy food so that you feel satiety and content.  \nIf you feel uneasy with what your husband is expressing to yourself, take a moment to share your feelings with him as well. If you feel like you are scared and want to keep on feeling good with your body and want to stick to habits that make you feel good with yourself, share that.  \nHope this message helps you. If you feel good in your body right now, congratulations, you have made an amazing process and work to be closer to yourself and that is something no one can take away from you.

Some people (like me) feel and perform better with far more carbs in their system\u2014trial and error over the years has shown me that. Others aren\u2019t as carb-tolerant and/or active, and feel better eating more dietary fat and more lower-carb, nutrient-dense veggies, including less (but still some) potatoes and fruit in their everyday diets.\n\nIn general, every meal should contain a decent amount of protein\u2014that\u2019s your base. (How much, once again, depends, but at minimum it\u2019s that palm-sized serving per meal, or if you choose to loosely track, 75g/day. Again, that protein number is the  MINIMUM our RDs recommend for decent health, but IMO most people will feel better with more protein than that, especially if you are active and/or big/muscular.)\n\nAdded fat can fill gaps in energy, satiety, and focus. If you\u2019re hungry between meals, add more fat to your next meal. If your energy is flagging, add more fat. If you do a lot of lower intensity movement or work an active job, added fat can be your best friend.\n\nFill in carbs as needed. At minimum, again, include a variety of veggies and fruits with each meal. But if you are active, especially in high intensity activities or endurance activities, you may want to purposefully include more carbs with each meal to support that activity, which means you\u2019re likely eating more potatoes, plantains, beets, \n butternut squash, and fruit (including dried fruit) than a Whole30\u2019er who isn\u2019t as active.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re not that active, you can (and should) still eat potatoes and fruit. You just may choose to work them into a variety of other veggies, instead of making them the star of the show.\n\nHope that helps!", "The point of Whole30 is that you shouldn't need to track, so I wouldn't say there's a formal optimal macro ratio. Similarly, there's no calorie goal or limit. The idea is more that, within these foods, you should be able to find a healthy relationship with food.\n\nNow, you might decide to track anyway. I have, and I was surprised how often I was eating keto-like macros. Eliminating sweets, grains, and legumes will keep you low carb, especially if you aren't eating a ton of fruit or potatoes. But there's no formal rule saying you must be that way; it is just what is going to happen when you eliminate so many carb sources. Some people (especially runners and athletes) might need to lean into more carby foods, and that is still keeping with the program."]}

Until this point, I'd rather drink it black than adulterate it with Nutpods.  \nHowever, I've been experimenting and I've found a combination that I think I will stick to forever going forward, as I plan to stay off dairy.

Then I found this Califia Farms Better Half creamer on Thrive Market, and decided to try that since it has the benefit of having coconut cream added to the almond milk base.  Splash of cinnamon...almost there.  But yesterday, I had the bright idea to chop up a date and add it to the blender.   PERFECTION.  My coffee is now back to being eyeroll-worthy.

You could be developing an allergy to one of the foods you\u2019re eating more of (eggs, avocado, tree nuts) or it could be environmental, medication related, etc. The cause of your hives isn\u2019t elimination of certain foods, like oatmeal, or anything else.

Some of the other symptoms could be the result of eating low carb.

Guess what...This is my very first Whole30 eating Chomps! It might be Chomps. I am cutting them and see what happens.\n\nFor the record, I think sometimes when we eat items with a bunch of dairy and bread it can mask an allergy. And when we eliminate those things that coat are stomach (dairy) or absorb toxins (bread), we see how it really impacts us. So maybe whatever is causing this was already an issue that is more concentrated on your whole30. Journaling your meals and symptoms can help. \n\nFor example, through Whole30 I learned that I am sensitive to black pepper. I have a parent who has always been, but I thought not me. Well, I also cook with a ton of it. And when I got better at cooking for whole30 (aka not just eating a bowl of grapes and  a compliant hot dog on lettuce wraps), I was ultimately eating a lot more pepper. Cooking more = more black pepper. And I developed heart burn when on Whole30. I never knew black pepper could trigger heart burn since I ate it all my life and it isn't spicy. So I cut it and the heart burn slowly got better. But the kicker is, if I am eating dairy and bread products I feel no sensitivity toward black pepper. No heartburn when I am eating poorly. So, it's not that Whole30 caused a black pepper reaction, is that I am no longer eating the foods that mask that sensitivity. So, from that I actually learned that when I am eating healthy (not the Whole30) just generally healthy and something gives me heartburn like raw onion or kombucha, I eat a piece of bread and that takes care of it. Papaya helps as well. \n\nI learned this from trial and error with Whole30 and after, journaling, talking to a doctor and nutritionist, and good old Google. I hope you figure out your triggers for issues. In the meantime...see how not eating Chomps goes. And one day try a Whole30 with zero compliant processed items.

I am also trying to add more strength training, which is another suggestion for women over 40.\n\nFrom what I've heard too, there really isn't a lot of blood work that will tell us we are in perimenopause, but I think a naturopath as someone else suggested might be a good idea. I went to my dr. to ask about perimenopause and all he said was, \"has your period stopped?\" When I said no, he just suggested Vitamin D for the winter.\n\nThe Whole30 tho has been a great help this month as I feel so much better and I have more energy, and really paying attention to what I am eating. \n\nAlso, while I am sticking to the Whole30 pretty good, I have kept in my protein smoothies after my work out - just one thing I kept.", "I also lift weights and used egg white protein powder. After working out, I would make a smoothie of 1 c unflavored almond milk, a fistful of spinach, 1 tbs almond butter, 1 tbs unflavored cocoa powder, 1 banana and the egg white protein - blended up with ice. I used unflavored collagen peptides in my morning coffee (with unsweetened nutpods) which also has a good dose of protein. The diet is also meat heavy so I did find I was getting enough protein.\n\nI\u2019m also over 40 and was having a hard time losing weight as well. My doctor did run labs and everything was fine. I did my w30 in January and have been steadily losing weight since. I still try to follow the plan at home pretty strictly but allow myself more freedom when socializing/special events."]}

There are a few answers I'd give you, and it would depend on what day you were on, and how much experience you have with the program (first-timer or alumni)?  \n\n\nThe first baseline answer is that fruit is Whole30 compatible, so as long as you're not using it in a way that is specified in the Pancake Rule (like creating an apple pie), go ahead and enjoy it. Your only job on the elimination phase is to eat Whole30 food--let it be that simple.  \n\n\nThe nuance you're asking about, though, is more, \"Is eating fruit after every meal or every dinner serving my Whole30 goals?\" And only you can answer that. If you're new to the program and in the early days (first two weeks), I'd tell you not to stress about it right now, keep eating Whole30 food, and keep paying attention to how you feel after meals and snacks (because what you're describing is essentially a snack, with carbs and fat).  \n\n\nIf you're an alumni or in the 3rd/4th week of your program and you ask me, \"I've been eating dessert every night after dinner--what do you think about that?\" I'd invite you to ask yourself a series of questions: \"Do I feel like I NEED something sweet to complete the meal? If so, do I mind that association, or is that something I'd like to uncouple during my Whole30? Is eating this after meals negatively impacting my cravings, energy, blood sugar regulation, sleep, mood, or digestion? Is there a place I could incorporate fruit into my meals in a way that feels better for my habits, my relationship with food, and my goals?\"  \n\n\nI can't answer that for you, but I'd invite you to introspect as you get further into your program; eating Whole30 food/preparing Whole30 meals starts to feel easy and sustainable; and you're organically starting to look beyond the technicalities of elimination to ask, \"What else could I do during my Whole30 to support my health, habits, and relationship with food.\"  \n\n\nHope that helps!

I've come across people telling others off for calling ground nuts & apple \"oatmeal\", but then they'll serve cauliflower \"rice\" about twice a week without betting an eye.\n\nWhat is the intent behind your dessert? Is it something easy if you're still hungry after a meal? Or is it to tide you over until you can have real dessert again? I think the intent matters.", "I definitely misunderstood the reasons behind not eating \"compatible desserts\" my first round and at the end my sugar dragon was still intact.

But you also may find with repeated experiments, you\u2019re able to dial in on the foods that you do tolerate well, and are worth it for you. For example, you may discover in life after re-introduction. That white rice is just fine, but corn or oats don\u2019t feel as good. Remember, reintroduction is a lifelong process! \n\nIn addition, there are some foods that you may be able to better tolerate if you start, including them in small amounts regularly in your diet. Dairy, legumes, and red meat are good examples. I have been able to tolerate most forms of dairy with regular inclusion in my diet, probably because my body has adjusted by creating more enzymes to help me digest them. \n\nEven if you do leave out most of the eliminated food groups, you don\u2019t have to follow the no added sugar rule forever. You\u2019ll probably discover that in many cases, a little bit of sugar in your chicken sausage or used as a maple glaze for salmon or plain old ketchup isn\u2019t it all problematic.

I brought a veggie and fruit tray. I chose to eat a hunk of sausage in red sauce and a huge serving of salad with vinaigrette. Normally I would have also had a big slice of the Italian bread and a side of pasta, and then some cookies, and maybe a cupcake\u2026but for nibbles I stuck with the fruit. But I still allowed myself some wine.\n\nToday we skied with friends and in between runs at the lodge, I opted to order just chicken wings in a dry rub\u2026plus a beer. But before, I would\u2019ve gotten a burger and fries and beer\u2026.\n\nSo for us, it\u2019s just keeping with the moderation mindset but not about obsessing about the little ingredients, like what was in the wing rub, or in the sauce, or in the salad dressing, etc.", "Check out the \u201cSlow Carb\u201d diet by Timothy Ferriss. \n\nHis book the 4-hour body discusses his approach that fit what you\u2019re looking for.", "Melissa has addressed in one of her dear Melissa articles the possibility of continuing on Whole30 until you lose your weight and her comment was basically don't do that because you're turning Whole30 into a weight loss program which it was never intended to be. I believe she said that there are better ways to lose weight post Whole30. Paleo and calorie counting comes to mind which is a lot of what I do.", "I just finished my first W30. Since I usually don\u2019t eat breakfast, just coffee, drinking black coffee gave me an easy slide into intermittent fasting. That, combined with using W30 to get off sugar, is my plan for continuing the weight loss."]}

Regardless of how my whole30 goes I will still eat French fries afterwards and do it guilt free. \n\nHas anyone done whole30 and treated themselves to In and Out fries from time to time? I really really want to be able to go out to eat SOMEWHERE with friends and In and Out is the strongest bet. I just have all this guilt because I do want to stick strong to the diet.\n\nI went out with friends the other day and sat there while they ate mac and cheese, tater tots, and then went to a special dessert diner and I held strong (ate an apple in the car on the way home). I just want my favorite food.  \n\nI don\u2019t know, someone tell me it\u2019s okay, or talk me out of it, or something.

I understand wanting to be able to eat out with friends but there are more actually compliant places like Chipotle, Cava and Five Guys. Also a lot of Greek and Mexican places will let you modify regarding kebabs and fajitas which are the \u201csafest\u201d bet. \n\nI\u2019m to the point now where I can make great fries in my air fryer but that doesn\u2019t help with the dining out.\n\nI guess if you\u2019re following in all other aspects then you would know of the oil was an eczema trigger but round1 8 days in is still new to be not following and not enough time for everything else to process out if your body.", "[deleted]"]}
