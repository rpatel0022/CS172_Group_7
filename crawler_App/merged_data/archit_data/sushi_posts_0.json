Rule 2 prevent the sushi from changing its designed temperature which will impact the taste.

This is ridiculous. Furthermore shoyu on rice tastes really good. This restaurant tries to play way beyond its league :)\n\nThose are certainly not \"big taboo in Japan\" people commonly mix wasabi and soy sauce.\n\nThe big no no is passing stuff. You have to put it on a plate for someone to take. That's because picking and passing bones is part of the creamation ritual. It would be like eating in an autopsy gown. \n\nA borderline thing here to me would be separating the sashimi from the nigiri. That's like uncooking a steak to it eat raw.

This is the etiquette for a nice sushi counter not a takeaway place.  \nYou have to eat it quickly because its raw. Asking for tiny rice is an affront to sushi as an art.

The folks here are actually really friendly and the service is top notch. It even says these are suggestions and not mandatory! Also, maybe tone is a bit strict but it's written by someone who is ESL, as they are in fact, Japanese. Either way it's fun to do things differently sometimes. Part of the experience.", "This is BS.

I can either flip the entire thing, which means the fish falls off. Or I can just dip a tiny corner of the fish, which is pointless.

Just keep trying til you get it.\n\nMy recommendations for practice: \n\nUse clean rice prepared with a solution of vinegar, sugar and salt. The rice will be sticky but will not adhere to moist but not quite \"wet\" surfaces. So with care, moisten your hands and cutting board before handling seasoned rice. \n\nThere are a variety of methods for mat-shaping your roll. Have fun making shapes :) This is one of my favorite parts about making sushi. For whatever shape you end up going with, I advise that you use a light-hand when shaping your roll. Rice that has been pressed excessively will not break apart in the mouth with as much ease or pleasure. Light pressing will allow you to form your roll while preserving as much of the individuality of each grain of rice, resulting in what I have found to be a more desirable texture. \n\nI'd like to reiterate my first point and remind you to use a sharp knife. Skilled chefs can get away with using suboptimal edges as technique is truly the most important aspect of slicing a roll. I recommend  new learners to use a knife with a blade that is at least 6 inches or 15 centimeters length. It is possible with time and practice to slice with less.\n\nSpam (fried or uncooked), Cucumber (solid when fresh), and Corned Beef (paste-like) are delicious and cheap to practice with but I recommend you apply your creativity to ingredient selection. Play with taste and texture but keep in mind the acidity of your rice and the strength of your half sheets of nori. \n\nThe Cut:\n\nYou will be utilizing a slicing motion to cut your roll. Chopping or chop-like motions will result in crushed rolls. It's not the end of the world when you crush a roll, it will be possible to re-form your roll at a later point though your interior ingredient placement will likely have shifted. I recommend placing your forefinger firmly on the spine of your blade in order to apply even pressure as you slice. Place the edge of your knife with about 4 inches or 13 centimeters from the tip to the far side of your roll. Apply a light, firm pressure as you pull back your knife, slicing your roll. The back side of your working hand will be parallel to your cutting board. To cleanly cut the roll your elbow will guide your firmly aligned kife, hand and forearm pulling your knife back through the roll (picture a vintage train wheel mechanism). Just pull your elbow back. The even elbow pull is the critical mechanism for successfully slicing your roll.Your other hand will gently secure your roll. Be mindful and cautious while handling sharp kitchen equipment. You will play with a handsaw-like motions. The fastest method is with a short, quick, single pull. You can rest your knife lightly on your roll to determine proportion and amount of pieces. Often times end pieces have some difficulty standing upright on 8 to 10 pieces. I often allocate slightly more roll to the end pieces to give them a larger base when standing but plating, presentation, and proportion varies and will ultimately be up to you. A measure of how well your slicing is progressing will be how undisturbed your roll looks after performing your cuts. You'll see what I mean with practice.\n\nBe mindful of the moistness of your hand and cutting board. This plays a role in stability and form. Work with purpose and urgency in order to prevent unwanted stickiness of rice to cutting board, hands and kitchen utensils. Wiping your knife on a damp towel between cuts can help keep your cross sections clean when working with messy ingredients. Be kind, especially to yourself and keep trying at whatever it is you set out to do in the kitchen and the world. Trying doesn't harm anyone so no need to apologize. Celebrate your victories, especially the little ones. With time you'll achieve new levels of mastery in hard skills and intuition. Keep trying. You got this.", "What the fuck", "Stoppppppppppp", "Raw spam sushi is crazy.", "Did it taste good still?  \n\nPracticing the cook on the rich, the process of handling it, and the roll takes time.  I recommend making some creative sushi rolls to keep the price down.  Good quality fresh fish adds up"]}

I would definitely trim the salmon a little more, so the part that's closest to the outer skin doesn't have any of the brown showing. Cut the nigiri slices at an angle instead of straight down, so that the tail isn't just flopping around and make the pieces a little shorter. If you want it longer, you need to cut them a little thicker. If you want a 'tail' at the end of your nigiri, it needs to be slightly at a point, and not just flat like a end of a square. \n\nThe udon soup needs some other things in there. If you purposely wanted it just the broth and noodles, I'd say add some naruto pieces and a couple pieces of inari puff tofu for some visual effect. Also cut the scallions lengthwise.

Try that, or add miso soup to the repertoire next year, it will give you that warm feeling at the back of your throat. Stuff you can make in under 30 minutes, leaves you feeling good for the next 5 hours. \n\nHere's the recipe: (for 1 serving, scale up to whatever you want and add any other boilable greens) I've put in the more traditional ingredients, but take out what you don't like and add what you do. It's a slightly salty soup made with vegetable stock and soybean paste.\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater\n\nMiso paste (you'll need to order this online if you can't find it in a local Japanese store, try the original flavours if it's your first try) - this is soybean paste, but don't go for the too expensive stuff if you don't want to.\n\nDehydrated seaweed (optional, also from the local Japanese store, comes as crumpled up hard things, but in warm water loosens up and rehydrates into rectangular pieces of very nutritious algae)\n\nTofu (if you're going to the store anyway..., still optional)\n\n1/8 head of Broccoli, \n\n2 large button mushrooms, (or approx size)\n\nAsparagus if you like them.\n\n(1/2 stem?) Green onions (any kind really, normal onions are fine too!) \n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Wash all the vegetables, bring out your knife and cutting board. Get out all the vegetables that are green, or any that are good when boiled. I haven't tried carrots, but I've tried radishes, onions, asparagus, mushroom, and broccoli. Whatever you have, really. Seasonal vegetables are also great to add if you've already made the soup before.\n2. Find a saucepan that can hold as many bowls of soup you want to make and still has some space for putting vegetables in. Start the stove so you can get boiling water. If you're a slow chopper, keep it on lower heat. If you have any fish bones, any extra fish pieces like the fins, etc, add them and scoop out any froth that comes up, until you see a slight sheen of the released fish oils on the surface of the water.\n3. Cut up your 'hardest' vegetables first, and add those to the pot first. This means the white parts of the green onion, normal onion slices if you are using those instead, the hard stem parts of the broccoli (with the outer skin removed, of course). This is a great time to use the broccoli stem if you usually throw it away, it has lots of nutrients. Add the dehydrated seaweed at some point here.\n4. Cut up the rest of your vegetables into bite-sized pieces too. Cut up the mushrooms into slices. The softer/faster to boil things like the top half of asparagus. Gather, and add to the boiling water. Cut up the tofu if you have any into bite-sized pieces too. Add to the water.\n5. Scoop out some of the boiling broth, and put in your eventual drinking bowl. Scoop out a tablespoon of miso paste, and blend into the water. Take care to not contaminate the miso with liquids. I don't know what happens, I've just been told not to.\n6. Add the blended paste to your pot and taste. If you want it stronger, repeat step 5. \n7. Serve in your bowls, making sure to evenly distribute the vegetables.\n\nIf you want to really kick stuff up, make warm rice, dunk in the soup, and eat the rice. My parents think I'm weird, but it tastes good. This is how it's meant to be eaten. Add all the greens you want. I'm not too sure about brussel sprouts in the soup, but I tried it yesterday and it wasn't terrible. Good luck!!", "What\u2019s in the two rolls on the top middle of the photo?

The way you cut (again check videos) you let the blade run through the sashimi so having extra real estate is helpful in getting those great pieces.  It\u2019s a gentle movement. There\u2019s definitely an art to this and the angle in which you cut against the sashimi.  In general it looks like you need slightly bigger pieces but also thinner.\n\nAll the pros use water in the rice hand to keep the rice from sticking.  You have to use a decent amount of pressure here but not too much.  This is the part I am still perfecting frankly.  Based on your picture you want to try and cover the sides of the rice ball a little more but part of that has to do with cutting the fish so there\u2019s more to drape over the side so to speak.\n\nLast tip, you can find this in your local asian/korean/etc. store:\nhttps://www.foodinno.com/wp-content/uploads/713493-3.jpg\n\nCannot recommend this stuff enough.

You need to use either properly farmed or previously frozen salmon. Wild caught Pacific salmon is known to carry parasites. At one point salmon was not an accepted sushi fish because of this.

I typically don't do different seasonings unless I'm cooking for a group, but I'm lazy.  Rice should be somewhat firm, where individual grains are distinct (but not 'crunchy'), and certainly not 'mushy' at all - texture is usually more a reflection of how the rice is cooled.  \n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, here's my starting point for seasoning:\n\nfor 5c rice:  7-8T rice vinegar, 1T salt, 4-5T sugar.  I typically adjust the vinegar and sugar depending on type.  proportions are directly scalable.\n\ninteresting variants are to use Hondawara salt, or to cook the rice with kombu leaves (which are then pulled out before cooling).  Different rice can be fun too, with short grained black or brown rice working really well and providing cool color contrast.", "i make rice in an electric pressure cooker, but i like alton brown\u2019s sushi rice recipe for the seasoning part. it\u2019s really simple: salt, sugar, and rice vinegar, 45 secs in the microwave in 15 second increments, stirring in between, and then mixing it into the rice. it smells super sharp but when it\u2019s mixed in it\u2019s perfect.", "Easy. \n\nRice cooker: Ratio is 1:1 rice to water\n\nVinegar is 1/4.

You fill it to the appropriate line after adding the rice.\n\nThose make some of the measurement efforts go away.\n\nAnother way to get rid of measurement effort: buy pre-seasoned rice vinegar that already has sugar and salt.  I use Marukan seasoned rice vinegar, and I splash it onto the cooked, cooling rice, eyeballing the amount these days.  Early in your adventure, you'll want to look up and use some measuring guidelines if that sounds too risky.\n\nFor comprehensiveness on the sushi rice making process, you'll want to add the following steps:\n\n* After adding the rice to your cooker pot, add cold water and swirl/swish that rice around to rinse off the starch.  Carefully pour out starchy water and do it again, several times, until the rinse water is no longer cloudy.  Then add water to the right fill line and cook.\n* After cooking, use a rice paddle (or a large wooden spoon) to \"slice\" and fold and stir your sushi rice to help cool it.  This is the time to splash in your su (seasoned vinegar) and keep folding, mixing the rice.  I lazily do this right in the rice cooker pot, after pulling it from the cooker and setting it on the counter... all of this helps it cool.  Traditionally, the rice is transferred to a broad bamboo container and fanned during this process.\n\nOne last rice tip: the rice is intentionally sticky.  This is unhelpful to your hands and blade while making rolls and slicing them.  Have a vessel of cold water (some suggest adding a splash of vinegar) at the ready, and dip your hands and your blade after each few touches of the rice.  It will keep the rice from sticking to your hands and will keep the blade able to slice through rolls without dragging.  My lazy solution of late is to make poke bowls a lot more often than all-out sushi.", "I recipe easy to remember I read somewhere but cant remember where is the simple ratio 9:6:1 (I tend to go 9:5:1, i like rice a little less sweet).  \n  \nThis simply means 9 parts of rice vinegar : 6 parts of sugar : 1 part of salt, then you scale as much as you want.  \n  \nVery easy to make I usually make at least 2 times for each cup of rice, so for one cup of rice, I just put a cup on scale 18 gr rice vinegar, 12 gr sugar, 2 gr salt, 10-15 sec in the microweave (the sugar doesnt solve in cold mixture), stir and it is ready.", "I love seeing how people all make sushi rice slightly different.

I'd like to chime in about the role of searching Google vs asking for help.  I've recently learned to make sushi at home and I've valued both (Google and asking questions here).

So it can't be emphasized enough that the preparation and use of the rice is extremely important.  \n\nIt's said that when you become an apprentice under a top sushi master, it can take up to three years before you understand how to select, blend, wash, cook and flavor the rice.  \n\nThen, learning how to properly form the sushi rice in your hand also takes years.  For a nigiri, the sushi rice needs to be only lightly and quickly molded in your hand so that each rice grain maintains it's integrity and isn't smushed and has \"air pockets\" in between each grain.  On the other hand, it can not be so lightly made that it easily falls apart.  \n\nWhen a sushi master places the finished sushi on your plate from his hand, the sushi will actually \"sink\" a tiny bit because of how lightly and carefully it's made.  \n\nUnderstanding how to properly select and process fish can also take years.  \n\nIt's said that how you cut the fish can effect how the fish tastes.  \n\nSushi may seem like such a simple dish with only a few ingredients but it is because it's \"simple\" that it is difficult to master.  \n\nHaving said that, there are different levels of sushi chefs from those that work at the corner neighborhood grocery store to the top restaurants in Ginza.  But even those that work at the grocery store need to understand the basics in order to make \"good enough\" sushi.  \n\nAdding mayo based sauces, chives, cucumbers, avocado etc can make properly rolling the sushi difficult as the fats and/or the loose vegetables can cause the filling to slip and not roll properly.  For the maki rolls, you might want to start with just a simple tuna (only) roll until you get a good technique down.  \n\nSpace the rice out cleanly and evenly.  \n\nWhen adding loose ingredients like chives, scallions or cucumbers, add them first/closest to you so that when you roll the sushi, it gets rolled first and held in by everything else.  \n\nBe gentle with rolling so as not to squash the rice.  \n\nMake sure your knife is very, very sharp.  Also a longer knife will be better when cutting/slicing to minimizing going back and forth in a sawing motion.  Use long, even motions when slicing from one edge of the knife to the other.   It should only require one slice when cutting fish and one, maybe two and a bit slices when cutting maki rolls depending on the size of the maki.  It's worth mentioning again, make sure your knife is very sharp.  \n\nTry to buy fish from a reputable Japanese or Korean grocery store.  They will usually have the fish in nice sized, clean blocks all ready to be sliced as is.  If you buy your own large fillet,  the fish is more likely to come out irregular and possibly more difficult to cut and the consistency will be off.", "For nigiri at least, the literal only variables are the quality of the fish and the preparation of the rice.  If your nigiri isn\u2019t as good as restaurant nigiri, start there.  Once you\u2019ve got that dialed in, the rest of your sushi will likely improve too.  If at all possible, try to sample the restaurant\u2019s sushi rice on its own.  Everything layers on top of that.\n\n[edit] some restaurants might wasabi-press or brush their nigiri with nikiri \u2014 that may be another factor but I doubt it\u2019s nearly as important as the fish and rice.  In any case, nigiri is the thing I would start your troubleshooting with.  There are likely too many variables in the rolls to start there.", "For me the biggest hurdle to get over to get my sushi closer to the taste of restaurant sushi was the rice. The rice has to be just right or it all falls apart. Get cooking and seasoning your rice correctly down and you'll see a huge improvement.", "Trust me, idk but theres 97% chance the rice is the problem.", "Incoming rant warning:\n\nAh, I completely understand. I think that when I make sushi at home the \u201ccali\u201d rolls  are always too sweet, I think it\u2019s the brand of Krab. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s really easy to try to overpack the rice, making it kind of mushy. At home, I think in the excitement of a fun kitchen project it gets a bit rushed, if that makes sense, and the rice doesn\u2019t cool down enough, or I don\u2019t really take enough time to do it properly because I\u2019m so pumped lol. \n\nI think also when you purchase fish, you usually can\u2019t go nutso so a lot of the rolls are similar-ish. \n\nDon\u2019t forget chefs are (usually) awesome at what they do. They also have prep cooks etc that help with the processing of the veggies, etc. it takes practice to learn to julienne cucumber, etc.  \n\nIf you are into Americanized sushi, (no judgements! I love it too) restaurants have access to deep fryers, which allows for a lot of fun textural options. Yeah, I know you can fry at home but it\u2019s normally kind of a process. \n\nThe cuts of fish matter too, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself for not having perfection without putting in the dedication/years of practice. :) \n\nI think a really good solution might be to practice cutting veggies and maybe just get a few orders of sushi rice as takeout from a local place you like.

I paid $200 and got myself these - a kinmedai, a kasugodai, 3 aji fish (pic 8), and a kanpachi. \n\nFilleting all of them and learning how to best treat and process each fish was a stressful encounter.

None of the fish that you prepared are species that I know are likely to carry parasites, but I am mostly familiar with fish that are common in the US. I don't think you need to worry about your health, but it would be wise to read up on the fish you may want to be concerned about.

And then once your knife could cut God himself, pay more attention to your cuts. Straight lines, with confidence--and remember that knives don't cut with an up-and-down motion, they cut by sliding.

With your recent series for omakase/sushi, while the overall images are beautiful, I find that when I stare too long, it begins to fall apart at the level of the hands. I know that the chefs move lightning quick and even as a enthusiast photographer with a digital camera, it takes me several tries to capture something I'm happy with; I can only imagine how much more difficult it is for you with a medium even more manual and laborious than mine. For Shinn East and The Menu, the chef is seen presumably brushing nikiri to the nigiri, but they are seen doing so on the platform which isn't typical---it's usually applied in the hand. For this piece from Nakazawa, I think there's improvement but still, the manner in which that chef's hands are clasped together doesn't immediately convey that sushi is being made (rather, I arrive there from context). When a chef is forming the nigiri in their hands, fingers/wrists are flexed and splayed in a very distinctive way. [I've thrown together this mishmash of sushi chefs' hands](https://i.imgur.com/5MwjkL0.jpeg) that I've captured over the years for your reference---if you continue this series for omakase (which I hope you do!), I hope these help you capture more critical details with the language of sushi chefs' hands."]}

There's nothing wrong with garnishing your nigiri; but the philosophy underlying nigiri is to keep things small, balanced and harmonious.

That said, I'm not sure the pipework is necessary on the first picture.   \n\n\nLet the rolls and nigiri speak for themselves.   \n\n\nAgain, though, great work overall.", "You definitely show early potential for plating. You can tell it's amateur though by WHAT you are using for garnish and some toppings used as well. But you have an eye for spacing, colors, and obviously photography which would be lighting.

I have my own small sushi restaurant here in San Diego, CA. and have been making sushi for over 15 years.", "The 5th photo is beautiful but also a bit overwhelming to figure out how to eat.

It misses the mark on the elegance of sushi, and worse, would obscure the simplicity and clarity of taste.\n\nPurportedly, on how to get her curated simple elegance look, Coco Chanel said \u201cBefore you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.\u201d I would suggest before you serve (or photograph), look at the plate and take two things off.", "Immaculate presentation and it all looks delicious.

For example; the scallop crudo would look better with no lime or flower or criss-cross green onions, imo. Still a very beautiful dish. As much as I love the little cute radish mushrooms, I'd personally never plate anything with them. They'd be awesome as decorations for potlucks and buffets though!

Would be prettier without all the fluff. Like a beautiful girl hiding under a bunch of makeup.", "I recommend you go to Japan, see how it\u2019s actually done and rethink your approach.

Usually I microwave my rice vinegar with a piece of kombu in it. The additional umami is definitely noticeable and appreciated. I dissolve salt and sugar in it just to taste. Techniques for mixing and cooling the rice are tricky, but if you have any questions I'd be happy to give you a quick primer.\n\nSome people cook the rice with kombu in the cooker/pot. Haven't tried this yet myself. I mostly do a lot of sashimi lately since it's easier and mad delicious. Make sure you cut against the grain to make the fish tender. And my main tip here involves rinsing. I rinse the fish under cool running water, dry it with a paper towel, and then repeat. Two rinses gives it a nice clean flavor (slime is fishy) and it's important that it be pretty dry. Also look into premium soy sauces cuz they'll take your sashimi game to another level.

Then when you roll it, simply roll the bottom behind the rice at the top, tuck it in tightly, and flip it over so the stroke of nori seals it shut when it gets moist.", "That looks yum!", "I like to do salmon zuke too that\u2019s always nice", "Yummy", "Looks yum!

Haters gonna hate.", "Not half bad man. Nigiris have a bit to much rice I think but hard to tell that through a picture. All in all I give this a perfect score 5/7.", "Dude this is actually pretty well done! Some constructive criticism coming in hot though haha-\n\nSo I would personally still advise less rice and more filling haha. See where your nori goes into the roll? From what I've learned, I would have a slight overlap there on the rice just enough to seal it. Your rolls here have about a half layer of rice on the inside still.\n\nHere is an example of a roll I made the other day to give you a better picture for what I'm saying,\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/l7wZwQ3\n\nEither way, with the exception of maybe like 3 pieces (and who is really going to get it 100% perfect anyway lol) the rolls look nice and tight, well filled, and your cuts are clean and that's exactly what matters. The thickness of your fish slices are right on the money. I also wish I could give you a high five because you used nice solid pieces of avocado inside the rolls. That makes a big difference compared to mushy ones. \n\nA personal tip- After you cut your rolls, try shaping them one more time but with very light pressure. The focus here would be to \"lift\" the roll but you don't want to squeeze anything out of the sides or make anything on top mushy. Square up the end pieces, and a slight press inward to make the roll slightly taller. This makes it easier to stand up on a plate and makes your ends uniform and pretty like the rest of the roll. \n\nAlso, try sliced avocado between your fish when you put it on top of a roll. Looks super nice.  \n\nI can't say much on the nigiri as I'm still learning to get those right myself and I find it very tough, but I think a lot of chefs would say that's either too much rice, or too little fish. I like my nigiri with a 2-finger-wide, thin rectangle slice of fish on a fluffy pill of rice- say about the length of the space between one knuckle to the joint on any given finger. To keep your rice airy with a defined texture just don't squeeze it too much when forming. \n\nFor your sashimi, both the thickness and direction of your cut, as well as what part of the fish you're cutting influence the texture and how you taste it so the best I can say is that's situational and just a matter of trial and error in learning the cuts. But if you want them to just look pretty, 1/4 inch thick trapezoid-like or rectangle cuts sit very well on plates, and long thin cuts can be folded over and laid on eachother or fanned out or even rolled into a flower or cylinders. That's just a matter of having fun with your presentation. \n\n\nAnyway sorry for the long wall of text, just figured I'd throw any pointers out there that I could think of! The biggest two things I can say are important (to me) when making food is to always give a shit, and actively seek to do better with every plate. But you definitely already got the hang of this!"]}

I feel they use colder than needed fridges, and the rice dries out and get hard / loses that nice texture it should normally have. Letting the sushi sit out doesn\u2019t help.

We haven't been disappointed.\n\nETA: someone pointed out it has to be the kiosk with the people actually making it. Do not make the mistake of getting the sushi from the deli or cold case that is not freshly made. Those are made offsite in a factory, frozen, then thawed. Yuck yuck yuck. AFC Sushi or Tsunami Sushi is the name of the kiosks where people are making on-site and that's what you want.", "I made sushi in a local grocery store for 6 months or so between restaurant jobs. I was the lead sushi chef and I took the job very seriously. I coached the other people and brought the quality of the rolls up a little bit from where it was before. The ingredients were always great. The verity was bad compared to a restaurant but I understand why. \n\nObviously our product wasn\u2019t as good as I have made at restaurants but I was proud of our product. We made some pretty damn good sushi. It\u2019s definitely hit and miss from store to store but in general it\u2019s worth the cost if you\u2019re craving sushi. \n\nAlways check the date and time on the label. If it\u2019s been in the cooling display for 4 hours or more then the rice will be hard and it won\u2019t taste that great. If you can get it within an hour or two it\u2019s pretty dang good though. I heard some people say they microwave it for 15-20 seconds and it makes a world of difference but I never tried that myself. \n\nA lot of times the chef won\u2019t mine making a custom roll for you (if they have a way to price it out and are allowed to). I was always happy to make the customer a custom roll. I\u2019d definitely recommend this route if the person doesn\u2019t mind. getting it fresh never refrigerated is by far the best option. \n\nThat looks bomb though!

However, to prep nigiri take your index through pink finger and lay them flat on your salmon perpendicular to it.  That will give you a measurement of the perfect width of a filet for nigiri.  Once you have your four finger wide filet cut, instead of slicing parallel with the filet like you do correctly for sashimi, flip it 90 degrees and slice at a 30 degree angle.  You will not have pieces that fall apart and separate like they can slicing straight across the filet vs perpendicular.  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/uiOq9EdFcys\n\nThere are videos showing both methods.  After slicing over 1,000 salmon, I slice the same way Morimoto does because it ensures the neta doesn't separate, it creates a perfectly rectangular neta vs an elongated trapezoid shape, it has much less waste, and you don't have to adjust and change angles as you are slicing down the filet to compensate for the different thickness of the filet going towards the tail.

I'm sure I have a long way to go to perfect my rolls, but it was easy to start. \n\nMost interesting things I learned:\n\n- Sushi literally means \"vinegar rice\", I loved learning this because I now understand what helps give the rice it's unique flavor. \n- Vinegar was originally added as a way to preserve the rice (before refrigeration).\n- \"Sushi grade\" fish is an unregulated term of art\n- A cool way to cut and remove seeds from a bell pepper. \n- 1lb of tuna, and half lb of crab goes a very long way! I probably made 6-8 sashimi, 2 California rolls, 5 temaki, and over a dozen nigiri.  \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Want To Try It Yourself?**\n\nHere's the starter YouTube instructions [video](https://youtu.be/Y3wUntEvUAw) that I used. The video also includes a basic shopping list. \n\nAnd the [sushi rice recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10754-sushi-rice) that I used. The mix contained:\n\n- INGREDIENTS\n- 2 cups sushi rice (as measured uncooked)\n- 2 tablespoons sugar\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- \u2153 cup rice vinegar\n\nLastly, you may want to find your own video on how to put the mix into the rice. I tried a number of them, and didn't necessarily prefer any one over the others.\n\nGood luck, and happy sushi making! \n\nE: formatting\n\nE2: minor improvements\n\nE3: someone asked in a comment if \"crab sashimi is a thing\" .

Directly on the rice, or top of fish or whatever topping, I put wasabi or some other seasoning like chili flakes, old bay, paprika. Any interesting seasoning blend that you think will match the flavor of the nigiri might be worth trying. You can put any sauce you want to. Anything you might like, but only a bit. Anything else you might use like herbs, tempura bits, fried onions/garlic, beef, bacon, fruit, etc, go crazy, just don't overpower the flavor of the nigiri itself.\n\nBut the food look great, the fish looks nice, and the rice/topping ratio looks good on both.

Or just another white one, and make the plating distinct.\n\nNice work both of you, looks delicious.\nAlso I hate that I can't see the picture as I'm commenting,  reddit is so annoying.\n\n\nEDIT: on second look, white plate could definitely use less sauce/garnish in general and specifically on the salmon on the bottom.

Don't bother with the rice if you can't make good sushi rice. \n\nA good tip when prepping raw fish to eat is to very lightly salt it and let sit for about 10min, then dab it dry. The salt really helps to bring out the flavor, especially if youre eating the fish plain. A lot of times, lackluster tasting nigiri or sashimi thats otherwise high quality and fresh just needs a little salt. If you wanna really go nuts, use a light amount of ponzu, orange, and/or citrus juice and some flake salt. The acid component balances the fat and the salt really sets off the flavor. Ponzu works well because it's umami and sweet, and orange adds a little sweetness as well. I'd go pretty easy on the dressings though, you don't overpower the fish. But definitely experiment with the level of salt you use and see what tastes best!\n\nLightly seared is very good! It changes the texture a little, in a good way! The fat gets a little melty and it ends up tasting buttery. Just salt the outside, and cover with paper towels and let it sit in the fridge for about 30min, sear in a ripping hot pan, almost smoking with some cooking oil for 45sec to a minute on both sides.\n\n\nCold smoked is very good! A restaurant I frequent smokes it with a smoke gun, but there are other ways to do it as well. The smoke and fat work well together.\n\nI've never tried it, but cured would probably be delicious. You could probably do it lox style, and use sugar, salt, and sake. You can also do a tuna conserva.\n\nAny scraps/ends/odd pieces, make tartare, or mince it almost into a paste. If you go with the mince, try putting it on top of crispy rice with chives, roe, and a really good flavored mayo or creme fraiche, or make toro maki of some kind. I had a dish with a tempura shisho leaf, uni, ikura, and seaweed that was pretty great, you could probably just exclude the uni. Ceviche might be good too!\n\nIf you want to veer from Japanese recipes, there are many good Italian recipes that utilize belly. Carpaccio, minced and added to pasta raw (Many sicilian pastas have raw fish), preserved, grilled/seared, salads, etc", "My boyfriend is a fisherman so we\u2019ve got a lot of it and I love making it into poke. Once I had a nice piece in my freezer and my mom (who\u2019s been a vegetarian her whole life) casually mentioned she boiled it and fed it to the dog.

It looks really bad.", "So sorry you got the newbie!", "Honestly this looks really bad. Some of the worst I\u2019ve ever seen anywhere. I don\u2019t want to be that guy but if you\u2019re a good friend to this person, you\u2019ll do more help by letting them know they need to train way more and should take it more seriously if they intend to continue in the industry and it\u2019s honestly unacceptable to sell this in a restaurant, even if it is an AYCE. \n\nThere\u2019s so many things wrong in these two simple pictures and there\u2019s a reason why some of the higher end places charge what they do sometimes and why they taste infinitely better.\n\nThe rice texture looks wrong could be from over squeezing it as she made the rolls or the wrong ratio of seasoning when they made the sushi rice or maybe even an issue with water when making the rice to start. \n\nThe filling to rice ratio or even the fish to rice ratio for the nigiris is way off too. They\u2019re covering the mistakes of being unable to cut the fish well or roll the maki without it falling apart by just adding more rice everywhere. \n\nThe cuts on everything is just terrible, some rolls get a smidgeon of salmon on top others get it covering it completely. The sashimi all look different in shape and size and looks like the fish was butchered with a knife that wasn\u2019t even sharp to begin with. The makis are all different sizes too. \n\nThen the plating itself is overcrowded and with no rhyme or reason as if they just wanted to see how much they can load up like they went through a buffet line. And presentation may not impact final flavor a whole lot but it should show a level of pride in a chef that can at least make something that makes me want to eat it. \n\nAnd finally no offense I saw you said it tasted fine but with the lack of attention to detail coupled with all these mistakes I find it hard to believe this sushi tasted decent. In fact I\u2019d be surprised if they even held much standards into the way they keep any kind of quality control. Just something to think about before you dine here again. \n\nIf your friend is serious about this as a career though, my advice is to find somewhere else to work that\u2019ll train her properly or maybe going online and finding some more tutorials, practicing more and inspiring her. Most sushi places usually start off new workers by training them in simpler tasks such as making the rice or seasonings, learning how to filet and prep the fish, prepping the veggies and fillings that\u2019ll go into makis and such. This looks like they had her running before she even figured out how to crawl.\n\nSorry if this was a bit harsh, I\u2019m not trying to be offensive to you or your friend or gatekeep sushi or anything but selling this is almost a crime imho. And if your friend just did this as a hobby then I prob would\u2019ve just passed by but as a restaurant this is offensive to me that they charge money for this kind of quality of food.", "It looks fine, and I'm sure it tasted even better.\nEvery piece of sushi that you enjoy is wonderful.\nIt's nice that some high-end places strive for perfection.

Eat it and enjoy it the way you want.\n\nThat being said, there are varying degrees of traditional, habitual, and cultural aspects of preparing and consuming sushi that doesn't hurt to know.\n\nTraditionally, nigiri - the cuts held into elongated shapes with rice underneath - are eaten by hand, in one bite, as prepared by the chef.  It is not uncommon for a more established sushi restaurants to provide a moist towelette to clean your hands from time to time.  \n\nIt is on the chef to prepare the nigiri to be bite sized.  \n\nSame with rolls, whether it be maki (seaweed on the outside roll) or gunkan (seaweed rice base with cuts resting on top), they are meant to be single-bite sized.  Can be eaten with hand.\n\nObviously, using chopsticks to eat nigiri or rolls is just fine too.  Both are very much the norm and acceptable in traditional etiquette.\n\nAs for dipping the sushi in soy sauce - again, traditionally, the chef will prepare the sushi exactly as how it is meant to be tasted.  You do NOT have to dip into soy sauce, and in many omakase style service, it can be a little rude to the chef to do so.  (It's like American equivalent to serving someone a perfectly seasoned dry aged medium rare steak, and watching the person drown it in A1 sauce and ketchup.)  \n\nBut in most casual establishments, even in Japan, having a little soysauce for dipping on the side is no biggy.  Do what you want.  \n\nWhen dipping nigiri, roll the nigiri gently to the side or even upside down (assuming there's no loose toppings on top) to have the cuts touch the soysauce instead of the rice. \n\nIf you are finding your rolls are too large for one bite, I am guessing that you are visiting a more westernized or contemporary restaurants that serve sushi.  US in particular has a habit of over-loading their rolls with tons of cream cheese, mayo-mixed toppings, deep fried toppings, etc.  \n\nTake multiple bites if you have to, don't force yourself to unhinge like a snek.  The restaurant already probably doesn't really care about etiquettes of sushi consumption.  \n\nAnd enjoy!  \n\nP.S. Futomaki is by design an oversized huge behemoth of a roll, and is meant to be eaten in many bites.", "One bite almost all the time. \n As you said everything else ends up being super messy and also you won't get a perfect bite from a round shape. Either your first or your second bite will have way too much rice.\nNigiri is different though. You can even nibble on most of those without making a mess and you will get proper nigiri taste with every bite.", "yeah or else they fall apart in two unfortunately", "Usually with chopsticks and with one bite.", "Yes", "Usually with my face", "Take however many bites you need to and don't care.", "One bite if it fits reasonably. 2 bites if it\u2019s a large roll since I\u2019m sure accidentally choking on a large bite at the table would be pretty embarrassing", "Real way is to use your hands. Dip the fish in soy sauce not the rice. Eat in one bite. If it's a nice place, you don't dip just eat how it's served by the taisho", "Yeah usually a piece in a single bite, if you're a regular at a spot tho and tip I wouldn't be afraid to ask to cut it in a few smaller pieces cause it's not hard if it's a basic roll. \ud83d\ude01", "One nigiri at a time.", "For nigiri, one or two bites. Either hands or chopsticks. Yes, I do dip in soy sauce mixed with wasabi / horseradish.\n\nGunkan sushi can be messy to eat in 2 bites, so sometimes I will do a 1-bite on that.\n\nFutomaki, two bites.\n\nI have had a sushi chef stare me down and I wasn't even at the sushi bar. What an asshole. This was at Sasabune restaurant.\n\nIMO, if I'm being polite, not loud, not demanding, and tipping, I should be able to eat sushi in a way that's comfortable for me."]}

We had a joint called Lobster House that was out-farking-standing for ayce but they closed (before Covid, I think).  Another ayce called Nori Nori is great if you like the goofy froo froo rolls and never want to see \"boring\" rolls like California rolls and simple tuna rolls (I much prefer the boring rolls)."]}

The hatsuyuki handroll bar in fort worth also serve two different kinds (santa barbara and japanese, sometimes more).\n\nBut Gunkan is not the only way. In fact, that is the least prefer. I prefer either a handroll (open half-size handroll with better uni to rice ratio) or a uni-ikura don. I believe a restaurant in the bay area have that. \n\nuni and ikura mix well although some times I do want to just taste the uni.", "Uni is by far my favorite thing on the planet. Unfortunately I live in a landlocked city in the US. It is not even available at sushi restaurants around here. I can only ever get it when I go about 2 hours away to Atlanta and there the going rate is about $20 for a single piece of Nigiri. Basically it\u2019s a once or twice a year treat for me.\n\nI am super jealous of the people on here that tell stories like \u201cI was walking by my local fish market and bought a fresh sea urchin for $8, they cut it open and gave me a spoon.\u201d", "I\u2019ve ordered trays of Uni to my house before, they overnighted it and it was fantastic quality. \n\nTypically you are choosing between Santa Barbara Uni, and Hokkaido Uni. Both are fantastic and also very different.", "I had an uni cocktail (yes, ridiculous) recently at Taps Barcelona. I got the worst food poisoning of my life.", "It\u2019s not always this way. Great uni I can describe as mildly sweet and like you said, it tastes like the ocean. It\u2019s definitely one of my favorite things to eat. Bad uni is on the other side of the spectrum.", "It was always described to be as an acquired taste, so I was nervous when I first tried it but I loved it. \u00a0I think if you enjoy oysters then you\u2019ll generally like Uni.", "Uni goes bad very quickly and the taste is different between locations of harvesting like with eel. It sounds like you got something worth buying again, but I would not expect it to taste the same everywhere else you go so just be a bit cynical when ordering it outside of any place known for uni.", "When I used to do more coastal fishing, I would go out on the tidepools and fill buckets with sea urchins. Then spend 3 hours that night cleaning them.\n\nI love cracking one open and eating it right there in the tide pool when it\u2019s super fresh. However, they really only keep in the fridge for a few days. I personally think they start tasting off after only one night in the fridge.\n\nI\u2019ve only had it at restaurants a few times and honestly, once you\u2019ve eaten it straight from the ocean, the restaurant stuff just doesn\u2019t compare.", "I too love it. I look at the color to gauge quality. Orange = good. Slightly more yellow, less bright, or even slightly green tinged = bad", "When it\u2019s good, it\u2019s good. When it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s BAAAAD. And I\u2019ve been to otherwise good, well-regarded sushi restaurants where I\u2019ve been served bad uni.\n\nGood uni has a mildly sweet, somewhat oyster-like flavor and very unique texture. It\u2019s quite pleasant. But bad uni is worse than good uni is good, and I don\u2019t trust most restaurants to consistently serve good uni, I\u2019m probably not ordering it.", "I like it when used as more of a condiment! A little scrape of uni on a piece of fish or roll can add a certain deeper flavor. It\u2019s too much for me to have a whole mouthful.", "I\u2019m a sushi chef and even I don\u2019t like uni. The only time I\u2019ve ever liked uni was fresh Santa Barbara that was cracked right in front of me", "I have pretty much loved every piece of sushi I\u2019ve ever been served; from monk fish liver to eel to oysters and every cut of fish and shellfish. But not uni. Never uni. Tastes like a vomit loogie. Last time someone tried to convince me that I would love it from Morimoto\u2019s. Wrong.", "Bad uni is SO much more common than good uni, to the point where some people have grown accustomed to (and even love) the slimy ammoniated taste, thinking that\u2019s actually how it\u2019s supposed to be.  *Some* foods have a little of that going on, but proper uni should absolutely not.", "Ocean butter!", "i smiled a little when i read your description.  \n\ni always tell people that when someone loves uni they say it tastes just like the ocean.  \n\nthen, when someone hates it they say ewww, tastes just like the ocean.  \n\nso you got it right either way \ud83d\ude09", "Why is uni so expensive?? It\u2019s an invasive species and there\u2019s way too many of them around the world.", "I only tried uni at an omakase dinner in Tokyo. Scared to try it, but it was so good. I dream of it. But I\u2019m scared to get it from my local place, I might try it at a nice place in NYC.", "I tried it once at an upscale Asian fusion place in Nashville. I\u2019m pretty fearless when it comes to trying new foods. I enjoyed it, but I\u2019m not sure I would go out of my way to try it again. It was creamy, slightly salty and sweet (like the ocean). Although now that I\u2019m thinking about it again I kinda want to try it again lol"]}

I just sprinkle it over the rice until it feels like enough. :)", "I would use considerably more than suggested, FWIW. I've heard multiple master sushi chefs suggest a ratio of 1/4-1/3, which would be roughly 4-5oz of vinegar. Of coursr, with practice, you'll get a feel for what works and make it to your liking. Too much vinegar is rarely a problem IMO, and you can always add a little more vinegar if appropriate.", "A regular cup, 8 ounces, is 236ml, and i assume since they use tablespoons as a measurement they mean 8 oz cups.\n\n*\"\u00a0I bought it because I didn\u2019t want to make the seasoning myself every time\u00a0\"*\n\nMaking the seasoning is probably the easiest part of making sushi!  I make mine in a small Mason jar because shaking it up to mix is a wee bit faster than stirring, and on top of it the ratio of rice/vinegar/sugar/salt is super subjective - what you love make make someone else gag."]}

{"title": ".", "selftext": "Hello i am Kush from India. Ive worked at a sushi bar for 1year in dallas,TX, USA making sushi over there. But that job wasn\u2019t a proper one as i used to get paid under the table because of my visa issues ( i went to the US primarily to do my masters in computer science where later i found my passion in cooking and switched). So now ive moved back to India and ive been doing apprenticeship at a hotel here in my hometown. But i dont really like this. I wanto to go japan to study more about sushi. I wanto work over there in japan for a few so that i can gain all the knowledge that i can use. I wanto to go back to the USA someday when i think im ready to open a business, but before that i need to go and learn sushi in japan..ive been thinking of culinary school but its hard for me right now as i have to manage the budget for school and expenses over there at japan. I recently came across an place called Tokyo Sushi School at Ikebukuro, Japan. They say that they have a intensive sushi program for a month where they can train people giving them an experience of a chef who worked for 3years. Also they said that they would assist me in finding a job on their website. The program at tokyo sushi school falls under my budget and the time i need to finish my course is something i could manage..i really wanto do this course thinking it might earn me a job over there in japan and at the same time i dont want to believe in such hunches and totally move out to a different country.

{"title": "GAME CHANGER: How Premium Japanese Rice Revolutionized My Sushi After 30 Years", "selftext": "*(Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with any mentioned brands and receive no compensation for discussing them. Brand names are used solely as reference points. Many other premium options exist on the market - I encourage you to conduct your own testing rather than simply taking my word for it.)*\n\nAfter 30 years of making sushi, including several training sessions, mainly focused on fish prep, in Japan, I thought I'd reached the ceiling of what was possible with ingredients available in my region. Then yesterday, everything changed. I discovered UONUMA Koshihikari rice, and it's literally a revelation that completely transforms the homemade sushi experience.\n\n# The Kokuho Rose Struggle\n\nFor decades, I used Kokuho Rose like many of us without access to premium Japanese varieties. Let's be honest: this rice never really allowed us to succeed\u2014we were just \"failing less.\" With Kokuho, you're forced into an impossible compromise: either the core remains al dente with a decent surface, or it's well-cooked in the center but becomes mushy on the outside.\n\n# UONUMA Koshihikari: The Revelation\n\nThe difference is MONUMENTAL. This rice has a homogeneous texture from surface to core. It's tender and melting without ever being sticky. It glides in the mouth while perfectly maintaining its structure during handling. Each grain is like a perfect little pearl of texture.\n\n# My Technique Summary\n\nHere's a quick overview of my approach:\n\n1. **\"Thick Mud\" Washing Method**: I weigh the dry rice, then use very little water to create a thick mud. This promotes abrasion between grains and effectively removes starch while limiting water absorption. I rub vigorously, then rinse 2-3 times.\n2. **Precise Water Calculation**: While Kokuho barely tolerates 20% additional water (1.2 ratio), UONUMA performs best with 30% extra water (1.3 ratio). This superior absorption capacity is directly linked to its exceptional texture.\n3. **Cooking and Resting**: After cooking, 10 minutes of rest is crucial. Success indicators include: no excess water on the surface, grains oriented in all directions (some even pointing upward), and an incomparable shine when transferred for seasoning.\n4. **Vinegar Seasoning**: For 500g of dry rice, I use 125ml of vinegar mixture (25%). UONUMA absorbs it with remarkable ease, each grain being uniformly impregnated without crushing.\n\n# The Result\n\nThe final result is light-years ahead of anything I've achieved in three decades with Kokuho. The sushi is light, the texture precise and defined, each bite offers that characteristic melting sensation of Tokyo's finest sushi.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you're a perfectionist who has never been fully satisfied with homemade sushi despite years of practice, I strongly encourage you to invest in Premium Japanese rice. The price difference is more than compensated by the radical transformation of the experience.\n\nI'm planning to write a more detailed article about my specific techniques for washing, cooking, and seasoning this exceptional rice. Let me know if that would interest you!\n\nWho else has made the leap to premium Japanese rice?

Also in many fish shops the person handling the fish also handles the cash register and even money. Not that big of a deal when frying up the fish, but raw I prefer it to be more controlled.\n\nAs for proper preparation, you can find plenty of youtube tutorials that will explain you how to clean the surfaces and consequently how to cut it. The most important thing however is storage and potentially thawing the fish. That is where the biggest risk is.\n\nDon't shy away from preparing sushi rice as well, make your own rolls and niguiri.

{"title": "Confused about Toro!", "selftext": "For context I work at a sushi restaurant and recently we\u2019ve been able to acquire several different cuts of bluefin belly. We\u2019re selling them respectively as toro, chutoro, and otoro.\n\nMy confusion stems from the fact that I was under the impression that toro is a broad term to denote all of the tuna\u2019s belly, while chutoro and otoro are some specific cuts of the belly. Our sushi chef insists that toro is its own cut but no resources I\u2019ve seen in the past nor present seem to support this.\n\nI acknowledge he\u2019s got a lot more experience in preparing and selling sushi than I do, but he also has a bit of a history of dumbing things down for us front of house folk. I\u2019ve asked him what part of the fish this \u201ctoro\u201d comes from and he doesn\u2019t really have an answer for me.\n\nWhen I asked him most recently he went on to explain that this toro is less fatty than chutoro but fattier than any akami cuts. He then pulled up [this graphic](https://karenlynncharters.com/how-to-cut-bluefin-tuna/) breaking down tuna cuts and pointed to the word toro on the side and said that was the part of the fish being used but to me it appears the graphic is just noting the cutoff point at which something can be classified as toro/belly.\n\nMy coworkers all think I\u2019m crazy for caring about this at all but I\u2019m just passionate about what I do and I like to try to educate the customers when they seem like they want to learn more about sushi.\n\nIf anyone has experience breaking down whole tuna or anything like that I\u2019d love to hear whether I\u2019m wrong about this!

So yes, toro is a general term which encompasses all the fattier cuts of bluefin tuna. And there is no specific line to differentiate between otoro and chutoro: it varies by individual fish, by season, by the person cutting the tuna. For example, that entire belly section labelled otoro-chutoro in the diagram, if it is from directly behind the kama, I will mostly sell as otoro because of how fatty it is.\n\nHowever, some restaurants do delineate further: chutoro from the belly is fattier than chutoro from the back, for example, and likewise chutoro closer to the head is fattier than chutoro closer to the tail.

Also a lot more likely to get on a school and land fish with the fall back being pacific yellowtail which is itself an excellent option.\n\nI fish for yellowfin tuna mainly and as long as you\u2019ve bled them properly and iced immediately you\u2019re going to have a quality product that\u2019s far better than what you\u2019d buy in stores.

Freshness of Ingredients\n\t\u2022\tRestaurants usually use fresher, higher-grade fish (often sushi- or sashimi-grade), stored and sliced to order.\n\t\u2022\tGrocery stores use fish that\u2019s been pre-cut, pre-packed, and refrigerated \u2014 sometimes for hours or even a day or more.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Rice Quality and Temperature\n\t\u2022\tSushi rice is crucial. Restaurants make it fresh, season it properly with vinegar, and serve it slightly warm or room temp \u2014 ideal for flavor and texture.\n\t\u2022\tGrocery sushi often uses cold or dry rice that\u2019s been refrigerated, which changes the texture and dulls the flavor.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Mass Production vs. Handcrafted\n\t\u2022\tGrocery sushi is made in bulk, often early in the day, with a focus on speed and shelf-life.\n\t\u2022\tRestaurant sushi is made to order, with precision in slicing, seasoning, and rolling.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. Ingredient Quality & Variety\n\t\u2022\tRestaurants might use real wasabi, fresh-cut vegetables, and premium nori (seaweed).\n\t\u2022\tGrocery sushi often uses imitation crab, low-grade nori, and pre-cut or frozen produce to save costs.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. Storage & Refrigeration\n\t\u2022\tSushi isn\u2019t meant to be eaten cold \u2014 refrigeration dries out rice and alters the texture of fish, making the whole bite less appealing.\n\t\u2022\tGrocery sushi has to meet safety requirements, so it\u2019s kept chilled longer than ideal for flavor.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nIf you read up until this point then I applaud you for absorbing all this information.

If you ever doubt your own intelligence or have a question, please feel free to abuse the ai system", "I have found grocery store Sushi taste to be based on who prepares it.

{"title": "Sushi Vinegar recipes", "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nI've been lurking on this sub for some time, and love seeing everyone's pics. I especially love when you guys and gals share your homemade sushi. As we all know, sushi making is about attention to details, and the more you can manage, the better your sushi will be. That being said, one of the most fundamental aspects of the sushi (whether it's nigiri or maki) is its rice, called shari, in sushi lingo. And shari's life is in the vinegar the chef is using.\n\nI've done my research and found several recipes I liked, and I'm here to share some of that journey. And ask for your recipes too XD! Let's start with the most common recipe we've all seen:\n\n* Beginner style:\n   * Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 120 ml\n  * Sugar: 3 Tbsp\n  * Salt: 1\u20131.5 tsp\n  * Simple, slightly sweet \u2013 common in Western cookbooks. Dissolve sugar + salt in warmed vinegar; cool and mix into hot rice.\n\nToo boring!\n\n\n* Kanto style:\n   *     Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 100 ml\n   *     Sugar: 2 Tbsp\n   *     Mirin: 1 Tbsp (optional, for extra sweetness)\n   *     Salt: 1 tsp\n   *     Kanto sushi vinegar tends to be sweeter. Some folks even use more sugar. Good for \u201cclassic sweet\u201d shari.\n\nToo sweet for my taste.\n\n\n* Kansai style:\n  * Rice vinegar (unseasoned): 100 ml\n  * Sugar: 1 Tbsp\n  * Mirin (optional): 0.5\u20131 Tbsp\n  * Salt: ~1 tsp\n  * Kansai vinegar is often less sweet and sometimes slightly saltier. Good if you want a more delicate, subtle flavor.\n\n\nI've experimented with these and gradually ended up with my own recipe by piecing different ones together. I have to say that my recipe is not something I would suggest to home cooks as it requires pre-prep (one or two days before you will be making your sushi). It uses two different vinegars (you can experiment with more) and kombu + mirin and sake.\n\n* My style:\n  * Put 10ml of (junmai) sake and 10ml of hon-mirin into a glass bowl and microwave until alcohol had evaporated (~15s or so). To test, swish the liquid, if long leg streaks of alcohol  do no show up -- it's good to go.\n  * Add 70-75ml of seasoned gourmet rice vinegar by [Marukan](https://www.instacart.com/products/16884141-marukan-seasoned-gourmet-rice-vinegar-12-0-fl-oz?retailer_id=279&product_id=16884141&region_id=12398438854)\n  * Add 30-25ml of brown junmai rice vinegar (I used one from [Mizkan](https://a.co/d/1slrrPR), don't buy it on Amazon, Uwajimaya has it for $11, if you're around). If you want darker color -> use more of this type.\n  * 0.5-1 teaspoon of sugar\n  * 1 teaspoon of salt (I used regular, but you can experiment with sea salt, aka `sel gris`, as you can add more of it for flavor while not increasing the overall saltiness)\n  * A piece of kombu (small enough to fit the glass bowl, wipe it slightly before sticking it in)\n  * Put back into the microwave for another 10s\n  * Mix things while the combined vinegar solution is pretty warm (100-140F or 40-60C), do not boil this, the vinegars will fly away.\n  * Cool, cover with the wrap and put into the fridge for at least 12hr, I prefer 24-48hr, it is then usable for up to a week.\n  * When making the rice, put a SMALL piece of kombu (2-3\"x1\") on top of it in the rice cooker. Technically, this isn't part of the vinegar mix, but this is an essential part of my recipe, so I'm listing it.\n  * Add vinegar to the rice while rice is hot and work your hangiri (or steel bowl) magic.\n\n\nI use this for my lighter color shari, it turns almost golden and definitely not white. It is a slightly different color than what Akazu gives you though. To make it darker and even more mouthful (you feel like you're almost eating bread) put a \u00bd cap of sake into the rice cooker, and add \u00bd teaspon of nikiri sauce to the recipe. That will make it prettttty dark, and I am not sure if this shari will be suitable to all maki and nigiri (I only experimented with salmon). It has a very rich, deep, earthy and savory flavor. Despite all the additives, the texture is exactly the same.\n\n\n* Lastly, here is a recipe from [Japanese Food Lab](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/akasu/) which is basically their 3-star Michelin shop's version of the vinegar, with the original notes from the [author](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/aboutus/):\n   *     Unrefined sea salt: 18 g (very mineral-rich, e.g. Maldon; otherwise reduce salt)\n   *     Yokoi\u2019s Yohee Akazu: 40 g\n   *     Iio Jozo Junmai Rice Vinegar: 60 g\n   *     Rishiri Kombu: 8 g\n   *     Aged Soy Sauce (3-year barrel): 5 g\n   *    (Total ~110\u2013120 g before any heating/infusion.)\n* Note: Steep the kombu in the vinegar mixture, possibly warm gently. It\u2019s a salty, umami-heavy blend meant for fish that\u2019s pre-salted (like in true Edomae style). Brands (Yohee, Iio Jozo) are tough to source but represent the chef\u2019s actual preference.\n\n\nI have not tried the last recipe yet, but I have Yokoi's Kohaku vinegar on the way from Japan ($82 for 1.8L) and actively looking to source the Iio Jozo Junmai Rice Vinegar now.\n\n\nI would LOVE to hear feedback and see your recipes. I am especially interested in your vinegars that work with specific fish/filling.\n\n\nAnd remember folks, I am a noob, so doubt me and correct me, I will only appreciate it!\n\nThank y'all for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1jwhctv/sushi_vinegar_recipes/", "created_utc": 1744345008.0, "score": 28, "author": "Informal-Purpose5979", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1jwhctv/sushi_vinegar_recipes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I personally wish we could tag this article.

Of course bringing a knife bag makes sense for the setting, but I\u2019ve not worked in restaurants (apparently long/or proffesion enough) in positions where this is something that would have crossed my mind. I imagine if I went to culinary school this would be a standard, but I\u2019ve only had my fill of being in restaurants that have basic standards and in unorthodox kitchen environments where my own intelligence were at gift to explore for itself.

Or to one of the local Michelin star restaurants that a good friend of mine had affiliation with and asking a chef that same thing, with expression about how important to me it would be to score this position. As well as looking up tutorials and studying some basic cutting/mincing/chopping techniques. Also, getting my own knife set. I know something\u2019s might be above and beyond, but those ideas have come instinctually due to my determination to land a position with this restaurant, and the opportunity to head a culinary career.

Before I ever made one nigiri at home I already had 35 years of cooking experience and 20 years of professional culinary experience. I was pretty far along with knife and rice skills. I had also made shari that I consider excellent. Those are three big parts of the puzzle. \n\nI also only have interest in making hamachi nigiri, which simplifies things. It gets complicated fast trying to source and serve 3-5 types of fish. I\u2019m perfectly happy to eat 30+ pieces of hamachi nigiri, some miso soup, and nothing else. I know what I like, so I can make those better (in my opinion/tastes) than anywhere that\u2019s affordable. If I want more variety, I\u2019ll pay someone else to have that variety on hand. \n\nFor me the biggest learning curve was with making the neta stick to the nigiri properly without over compacting the rice. That\u2019s a huge difference between low/mid tier and top tier. The best advice I have for that is actually watching the hands of a master, then another, then even more. Handling everything *just enough* to get it right is something that most people will not pick up on easily. Some will *never* really see the difference in what is being done when it is done really well. \n\nSome people will never make decent nigiri, much less top tier. Some just need to practice. Pretty much nobody will do it the first time (or even in the first few years of trying). You have to try before you will know how far away you are. You have to keep trying if you want to get better.", "We've made sushi, including nigiri and rolls at home, but it does take some planning and practice.\n\nThe fish needs to be commercially frozen to get rid of any bugs.

I found I could cut off what I needed and then seal the fish to go back in the freezer for the next time which is helpful when using different fish.\n\nThe rice is the hardest part IMO. It takes some experimenting to get the right taste and level of ingredients. \n\nOnce you get the fish sliced how you like it and the rice dialed in then assembly is the next challenge.

A real master makes it look easy because he/she was training for years!\u00a0\nTop-shelf with michelin grade quality - imho unfeasible by an amateur at home.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you make it to perfection without proper training let me know thoug.

It\u2019s an art form and honestly, part of the experience.", "Of course it's possible to make nigiri sushi at home, but unless you've had some training and some experience it's going to be close to impossible for it to be \"good\".\n\nSourcing the fish and preparing them is the least of your worries; 75% of a good nigiri is in the shari: the rice you use, the way it's cooked and seasoned, the way you form your shari, etc. Apprentice sushi chefs work years prepping and cleaning even before they're allowed to cook the rice.\n\nThere's a reason why Japanese families don't make sushi for dinner.  They'll make temakis, or donburis or even makimonos but if they want nigiri sushi, they go out to eat it even if it has to be at a kaiten place.\n\nThis isn't meant to dissuade you; just to temper your expectations.  If you're eating it and not expected to serve guests, try all you want and you'll learn how difficult it is.", "Longos and Costco are your friend. Longos carries (or they were since I was last there in 2024) Bluehouse/Atlantic Sapphire brand salmon, which is marketed as sushi grade. Costco also carries sushi grade salmon in the form of their Norwegain farm raised without antibiotics. Don't buy anything from Fortinos, No Frills or FreshCo. Sobreys also has their oceanwise land raised salmon which is good for sushi. Southern Ontario has plenty of options. For actual sushi making kit, if you are ever in Etobicoke, Sandown Market at the south end of the 427 is a place I swear by. Don't bother with Markham and Richmond Hill. Sandown Market is where it's at.", "I started making sushi at home during the pandemic. I have improved along the way and I\u2019m at a place I\u2019m happy with my hosting skills. I really can\u2019t find like minded people at my level which is just mid tier at best. But I enjoy my sushi as much as my second tier sushi favorites. And at home I can put together all my favorite dishes plus give my friends a fun night out.\n\nI\u2019m at a point where people are saying they enjoy my sushi more then eating out elsewhere.\n\nI do sashimi and sushi. No rolls. Too much work for me. I serve myself and 5 guests. I have a bar outside I use. I don\u2019t use words like nigiri because I\u2019m not trying to impress anyone. Haha. It\u2019s like when I went on a cave tour with full gear in the sequoias with a small group of 5 at 10pm. Only a few hundred people get the chance to do this tour every year. The first thing the tour guides told us was it\u2019s not \u201csplunking\u201d it\u2019s called \u201ccaving\u201d. The people saying splunking have never been caving.\n\nI know that\u2019s a false equivalent but use whatever term you impress yourself with. I just want to have fun and surprise my friends with better than expected sushi, good music and sake and good company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yy5mqy9eccve1.jpeg?width=3017&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4aedd886555dd6dd5d10bb09c9ed2cd0329a047\n\nI make the rice a few hours before my guests arrive. The rice is the most important. If you have good quality fish and rice then nothing will taste bad. You must rinse the rice until the water is no longer cloudy (about 7-8 times). I get Nishiki rice. I rinse it in the slow cooker pot. After rinsing I fill water like one knuckle above the rice. Then let it soak for 20 minutes. I use room temp water for all these steps. Then after soaking I turn on the rice cooker. For 6 people to feed I use 5 cups of rice.\n\nAfter the rice is made I will add seasoned vinegar which already has sugar in it. I use Marukan. This is where I see others seasoning the vinegar themselves. I\u2019m not a restaurant. I\u2019m having fun and I\u2019ve found the seasoned vinegar that works for my taste buds. Save yourself the early stage of starting to make sushi at home. I add about 2 tablespoons er cup of rice plus a little more. It\u2019s important to gently add it and mix it in well. So it is uniformly spread.\n\nI leave it in the rice cooker on warm (and fold over the rice every 20-30 minutes before my guests arrive) and around 30 minutes before my guests arrive I turn off the rice cooker completely with the lid on. I do ask my guests to arrive promptly. By the time my guests are settled in I put about 10-15% of the rice in a separate unused rice cooker pot which I will use on my first batch of sushi.\n\nSo it is cooling off at this stage. It\u2019s like a half inch of rice at the bottom of my fresh unused rice maker pot.\n\nI like to wear nitrile gloves while making the sushi. I have a little vinegar (you could probably use water also) in a tiny cup on the side and were my gloves lightly with it when touching the rice to make the rice not stick to my hand. I cut the fish slices. Wrap the fish in Saran Wrap and put back in ice. Then make my sushi. I use whatever toppings I\u2019ve enjoyed at sushi restaurants.\n\nI take off my gloves and eat with my guests.\n\nAnd we eat about 1 dish every 15 minutes. This goes on for 4-5 hours. Dishes could also be appetizers.\n\nFreshness of fish matters. I put mine on frozen ice packs in my fridge with the fish wrapped in Saran Wrap. I buy it the same day I use it. I bring plenty of ice and a cold sealable bag to the fish market and come straight home.  I also prepare the fish for that evening so it\u2019s all blocked and trimmed properly. I have the fish market remove the skin.", "I've been told by sushi lovers that my nigiri is top-tier. It's not super special, but getting the rice-to-fish ratio makes a big difference in perceived quality. Once you get your rice to a good level, and you have good fish, then the actual assembly is what makes the biggest difference. \n\nSure, amazing rice, and homemade vinegar can elevate it even more, but IMO, that's a possiblee \\~5% improvement. A nice perfectly cut thick slice of fish over an appropriate sized ball of rice is going to be a much bigger piece of what makes your nigiri go from \"pretty good\" to \"luxurious\".", "Making quality nigiri is much harder than people think. Years to get to top shelf quality.", "I'm working on nailing sticky rice", "It is easily worth the time and effort. If you source well - but even Costco salmon is good - you will have a lovely serviceable meal in short order.\n\nPoke bowl? Easy. \n\nIt may be a B+ but it will be pretty good. Eventually handrolls and nigiri but just sashimi will be lovely over a bed of rice."]}

Think low lighting, warm wood interiors, and intimate seating at the chef\u2019s counter (I believe there are only 8\u201310 seats). It feels exclusive without being pretentious \u2014 very much main character energy.\n\nThe Experience:\nI opted for the full \u201cKill Bill\u201d omakase (MX$2,200, about $130 USD). It\u2019s a 10+ course tasting menu featuring a mix of Mexican and Japanese ingredients. The chefs explain each course, and the pacing is intentional \u2014 slow enough to savor, fast enough to keep it engaging.\n\nStandout Dishes:\n\t\u2022A truffle-topped tuna tartare on crispy nori with edible gold \u2014 literal perfection.\n\t\u2022Wagyu beef with a quail egg yolk in a soy reduction \u2014 melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\n\t\u2022House-cured sashimi selection served in a beautiful ceramic bowl that made me pause before even eating.\n\t\u2022And yes, the sushi is served on those iconic wavy ceramic plates you\u2019ve probably seen in videos.\n\nDrinks:\nThey have a curated sake list and cocktails, but I stuck to sparkling water to keep my palate focused on the food.\n\nReservations:\nYou have to book through Instagram (@killbillcdmx) \u2014 they use WhatsApp to confirm. I recommend booking 2\u20133 weeks in advance since seats fill fast. They offer two seatings per night.\n\nOverall Verdict:\nTotally worth it if you\u2019re a fan of omakase and appreciate a theatrical, multisensory dining experience. The blend of Mexican terroir with Japanese technique is beautifully done. It\u2019s not just about the food \u2014 it\u2019s about the full ambiance.\n\nWould I go again?

Small premise: my partner didn't feel safe having raw tuna at home (and we don't like salmon), so all the fillings didn't have raw fish:\n\n- Surimi, cucumber, avocado (California-inspired)\n- Tuna (can), sushi mayo, cucumber, avocado.\n- Asparagus tempura\n- Prawn tempura, avocado\n\nOverall, I'm not very happy with the result (apologies it looks messy with the sesame seeds sprinkled directly on the plate, but since it took me 2.5h I was running out of time, also slicing the avocado very thinly to put at the top was very hard), particularly because:\n\nRice - I think the quality of the rice was not great (it's what I found in the shop as sushi rice). I rinsed it very well, till the water came out clear. Put 1 cup of rice in 2.5 cups of water in a pot, high heat, when it started boiling reduced the heat, lid on, for 10 mins; after 10 mins, turned off the heat, still lid on, let it sit for another 10 min. Seasoned the rice with 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1.5 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt (previously heated in the microwave so sugar and salt could melt). Distributed on a baking pan and let it cool down. I still think it was slightly overcooked and I was worried it was too much water for this rice I used.\n\nFillings - mmh, not sure what, but I need to come up with better ideas. My partner liked them all, except the tuna one, I didn't mind the tuna one either. I had Philadelphia as well which I planned to use, but didn't in the end. And maybe I felt I was pressing too much when rolling, sometimes the filling was coming out slightly... But felt they were generally bland...\n\nCutting - I had a sharp knife and kept it wet when cutting, but somehow I felt it wasn't sharp enough, cause I couldn't just push down of course, but had to cut by going back and forth... Yet somehow, even though I thought I was gentle, holding the inside out with my other hand's fingers, sometimes was ruining the shape of the roll... So I still feel that the rice was not firm enough (?)\n\nAnyway, maybe I'll give it another try soon... But there's so much to improve, I know. :( any suggestions are welcome!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jstac6", "created_utc": 1743943483.0, "score": 37, "author": "No-Hurry-5593", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1jstac6/my_first_time_homemaking/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Very nice first effort.

Inb4 all the \"there's no such thing...\"\n\nbut really, OP, there's no official regulation and process in the US for what is labeled 'sushi grade.'  It is purely marketing terminology.\n\nThere are details to how most fish handling and shipping is done post-catch, and BASICALLY ALL fish you buy at most stores have been frozen in blast freezer or commercial freezer for long enough to be considered safe for consumption, even if raw. \n\nThat being said, consuming raw food will ALWAYS come with a certain level of risk that is higher than consuming cooked version of the same item, however miniscule that risk may be.\n\nIf you are in doubt of the condition of the fish, freeze it yourself in your household freezer for 2\\~3 days, then thaw unsealed in a fridge over a day.   That should give safety and texture you desire.", "My opinions, 15 years into this journey and no problems:\n\n-  Almost any frozen tuna is ok. Usually frozen vaccuum packs. When you buy the fish frozen it hasn't thawed and started becoming less tasty, and you have complete control from freezer to plate.\n\n-  Follow instructions for thawing, what I have read is to thaw in the fridge removed from the vacuum pack. I put it in a covered glass dish in the morning and it is ready to cut by 4:30pm. Some bags have instructions that say running water over the sealed package ok, but I imagine it isn't as evenly thawed.\n\n-  Fish with less prominent lines of white tougher parts is better. In the southeast US, Publix frozen tuna is better, then Costco, then Aldi. Better texture, not safety.\n\n-  Experiment to find the best time to cut (for me, ever so slightly frozen) and direction (minimizing the impact of that grain by cutting across it.) Odd shaped bits and anything with too much white streaks gets turned into spicy tuna mix at my house.\n\nYou do you, you can't really go wrong if you buy frozen and thaw safely, practice makes it easier, you'll be fine.\n\nEdit to add, I reread post, apologies I thought it said tuna, not just fish. I haven't found any fish other than tuna and crabsticks that I like for home use (and crabstick has to be a specific brand made in Japan, in my town purchased at the Vietnamese market, the US grocery store has a weird flavor and texture to me.)", "Somewhere in Mekong Plaza or H Mart in Mesa."]}

IIRC, its due to botulism.", "I will give you the truth. 99.99999% of sushi restaurants in the U.S (and many in Japan) thaw fish vacuum sealed. As long as you keep the thawing temperature below 37 Fahrenheit, there is a one in tens of millions chance that botulism will occur.", "Some misunderstanding and half-truths in op.\n\nOxygen does not kill harmful bacteria.  What it does is inhibit toxin formation from spores of certain bacteria that cause botulism and these thrive in moist environments that are low in acid and oxygen, just like in a vacuum sealed bag.\n\nThe bacteria is kept in check in cold environments so thawing them in the fridge is fine.  The problem occurs when temperatures exceed 41F/5C because that's when these spores germinate and it takes about two hours at that temp to create enough toxins to make it a health risk.\n\nSo, it is safe to thaw while in a sealed bag but it should be done quickly and close to just above freezing temps as possible.  The best way to thaw frozen fish quickly is in ice water.  Thawing in a sealed bag above the 41F/5C temp for an extended period of time is risky and that's why it could be a health code violation.\n\nShould you report it?

Yea technically you shouldn't thaw stuff in warm water in a vacuum seal because of the risk - but at the same time...you also expose the fish to a ton of oxygen while thawing that basically oxidizes the fish.\n\nPersonally, Id prefer to eat the fish that was thawed in a sealed environment as long as it isnt left too long. From a professional stand point they absolutely 100% should adhere to the inspectors advice. There can be serious legal repercussions if someone gets sick or god forbid dies due to not following them.", "Is it technically a food safety violation? Yes\n\nIs it actually going to harm somebody? Most likely not\n\nIf you want to be truly correct about defrosting stuff, as far as I know, it's best done over night in the fridge, or as others say ice water, and then replace the bag it's in and put a paper towel with it to collect excess moisture since it won't be completely defrosted by then (probably)\n\nIf they habitually defrost this this way every time and it's the same amount every time then I'd suggest bringing it up to them like yo we could just do this overnight in the fridge to be a bit more safe\n\nIf it's an emergency and they know they'll need it in an hour or so then me personally I wouldn't care but that's just my opinion \n\nI do have servsafe certifications among others so I know I really shouldn't say that but what good is having a certificate if you don't use it to your advantage \n\nRealistically speaking it's probably more likely you win the lottery than this becomes an issue", "So my Costco sealed chicken packs can\u2019t be thawed in the sealed bag ?", "I'm sorry the oxygen kills bacteria?\n\nThis is 100% not true.", "[deleted]"]}

Also while I did have a mild case of covid last year, this has been an ongoing thing for 3 *decades*.\n\nThis issue: I've always been excited to try new foods and I've dabbled in trying raw seafood at sushi restaurants for over 3 decades. I like to try simple versions of new things before complex so when I first tried sashimi (raw fish no rice or extras?) I didn't dip in soy sauce or add mayo or wasabi. I tried different cuts of tuna from different parts of the tuna fish, as well as salmon, a piece of yellow tail, and mackerel and I'll be honest I couldn't taste much of anything. My cup of green tea had more flavour and scent. Myself and my sushi-fan friends were all confused. This was at a popular and busy restaurant in Michigan.\n\nI've re-tried over the years at popular places in Illinois, New York, Queensland Australia and New South Wales Australia and still *plain white rice has a stronger flavour*. I'm baffled. Obviously I can just add sauces, seasonings, etc but at that point it's just a textured, flavourless vessel for other flavours.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Is there a way I can *teach* my body to detect the flavours? I'd love to sit and enjoy a poke bowl or a plate of fresh sashimi but at sushi restaurants I have to stick to seared and cooked fish and meat to taste anything.

Lower quality ones tend to be firmer but salmon still has this addictive taste and texture.\n\nId say just enjoy your meal. You will figure things out eventually", "So, different people have different amounts of sensitivity to taste and smell, so besides smoking and drinking, you could just have less sensitivity to taste.\nAs others have mentioned, it's possible also that frequently eating very seasoned food, as you like to try new things, may mean that subtle flavors aren't going to be noticable.\n\nOn the other hand, there is something to be said for having seasoning. Wasabi, like salt, is a flavor enhancer. If you've had vegetables that tastes bland before salt, added a tiny bit of salt and noticed not the salt, but the flavor of the vegetables, you're familiar with this effect.\n\nI'd suggest adding the tiniest bit of wasabi or soy and seeing how that affects your sense of taste of the fish.", "if you tend to eat/drink sugary and salty things along with smoking and drinking, then I would speculate your taste buds would not detect subtle sweetness some fish has raw. if you take a break from that kind off food (I do a lot due to a sugar addiction) you may able to appreciate things some things others don\u2019t understand. \n\nother than that, maybe it\u2019s just not your thing.

This drip includes not only the fish's natural moisture and nutrients, but flavour compounds like umami as well.  The more drip you have, the less flavourful, less nutritious, and drier textured fish you get.\n\nThe way to minimize drip is to thaw it as slowly as possible, the exact opposite concept to flash freezing.  This means, the closer you are to the 0C-1C range, the less risk of creating drip and the way you create that environment is salted ice water.  The only drawback to this is the time it takes to thaw completely which of course will depend on the size of the saku, but generally a 200g block should take about 3 hours or so.", "Probably a temperature thing since it can get colder without freezing than just plain water.", "I would not recommend thawing vacuum packed fish in the sealed plastic.

I let it sit for half an hour or more with the lid on then I take it off, pour the rice vinegar mixture (idk exactly the vinegar amount I use, maybe 80ml, a teaspoon of salt, 3 teaspoons of sugar and a teaspoon of apple vinegar). Then I let the rice cool down and when it's at room temperature I start making sushi. It's not dry, not wet, it's not too sticky and it stays together just fine"]}

{"title": "First timer - need help with a few difficulties?", "selftext": "Our family loves sushi rolls so my wife and I took a sushi class on a recent cruise. Cue my new obsession (thanks ADHD!). I dove head-first down the YouTube rabbit hole, spent way too much on supplies and ingredients at my local Asian market, and we had our first home sushi meal last night.\n\nIt was... not as easy at home as it was on the ship.\n\nIssue #1 - I made 1 cup of rice expecting it to make 5 to 6 rolls (based purely on Google). It *barely* made 2. It seemed like I was using a lot more rice than we did on the ship. We used a full sheet or nori for both so idk what the deal was. I just know on the ship the sushi chef kept telling everyone they had too much rice. And yet I used almost half of my 1 cup of rice for 1 roll.\n\nIssue #2 - my rice was WAY too sticky. I'm talking super glue sticky. I washed itultiple times before cooking (until water was running clear) but it still came out like rat trap glue. That may be what contributed to issue 1 above since I had a difficult time spreading it due to the stickiness. I kept my fingers & hands damp but it didn't matter. \n\nIssue #3 & #4 - the shrimp. Oh my gosh the shrimp. \ud83d\ude21 I bought fresh shrimp (I think they were labeled like 12-15 size) from a local market and went to skewer them (right under the back \"spine\", where the vein runs) in order to boil them and keep them straight, but that's when I noticed they were not deveined. In order to devein them I had to cut the backs open, which meant I could no longer skewer them for cooking.\n\nWhich leads me to the real issue #3 - How the crap do you devein the shrimp without mutilating them? Cutting the back open often times cut the vein open as well, leaving me with a lot of cleanup under cold water. \n\nIssue #4 is a result of #3 - cooking them straight. I resorted to peeling them, cutting slits in the bellies, and cracking the spine in order to flatten them. A couple of them just split it half. The rest of them still curled up when cooking. And they got tough and kind of rubbery. Maybe this is caused from over-cooking them? \n\nEven with all my issues, the family still said it was the best meal I've ever cooked. I'll wear that badge with honor. Taste still ended up amazing.\n\nPrep - 2/10\nPresentation - 6/10\nTaste - 8/10\n\nHow can I improve on my issues above? Is it just practice and experience or is it a procedure and preparation issue?

But I may be able to help with your issues based on my limited knowledge/experience and the information you provided. \n\nIssues #1 & 2: Washing sushi rice should be a long and tedious process. I\u2019m not sure what kind of rice you were using or what you were doing exactly, but it should be short, fat grains (Cali Rose), and you should be washing it by moving the rice around a lot with your hand and rinsing and repeating many times. Always cook more rice than you think you\u2019ll need, and you don\u2019t need a full sheet of nori per roll. You should cut them in half horizontally and that should be enough for a roll with rice on the outside. A full sheet is usually used for maki-style with the seaweed on the outside and uses a lot more rice. The amount and mixture of your rice vinegar, salt and sugar (sushi zu) will also determine stickyness (along with how cooked it is), so make sure you have that sugar/salt ratio right too (I use 3 - .5 sugar to salt). \n\nIssues #3 & 4: The only help I can give for this issue is spend more money on peeled, deveined shrimp. Boil to cook, and if you\u2019re blending it for a mix, make sure it isn\u2019t blended too much and wring it out or dry it out somehow before rolling it up. \n\nI hope this helps a little, and I wish you luck on your future sushi-related endeavors."]}

Unexpectedly adventurous & unique flavours.\n\nGot the Oki Omakase set (17-course, $120 USD) from Chisai Sushi Club. Overall, the interior has a very hip ambiance and you can tell off the bat that it\u2019s not your traditional omakase spot. A lot of unique flavours were brought, some standouts:\n\n(1) Was a bit freaked out by the snail roe on the oysters, but it had a nice brininess and texture similar to ikura. \n\n(2) Albacore sashimi with Chinese seasonings was very unique and had tons of umami. \n\n(4) One of my personal favourites - the fluke with olive oil, flaky lemon salt, and cucumber oil. \n\n(6) Horse mackerel with Indian seasoning paste - I appreciate the creativity, though I found the flavour to be a touch too overwhelming and didn\u2019t let a lot of fish flavour through. \n\n(7) Madai with licorice salt and shiso - really enjoyed the playfulness in having the licorice salt bring out the licorice notes in the shiso, and the madai was a great fish choice to bring that to life. \n\n(12) Loved the European / Mediterranean theme of this piece: mackerel topped with Swedish mustard and dill. Almost had a lox bagel vibe to it. \n\n(13) Barracuda topped with caviar and 1 black peppercorn - such a fun experience when the peppercorn pops in your mouth and brings a little brightness to this otherwise quite savoury bite. \n\n(14) Scallop seared with foie gras - this one wasn\u2019t as unique but had to include it because it was just too good. Impossibly rich and the scallop was very plump and sweet. \n\n(16) The hand rolls were okay. Yellowtail + zucchini, spicy tuna + bamboo shoot. \n\nOverall had a great time and chef Darren has such a whimsical and fun spirit that ties the whole room together. Definitely a spot for sushi enjoyers who are looking to step out of their comfort zone and experience unique flavour pairings.

Cutting it in the opposite direction creates torsion which makes the flesh prone to separate from the sinew.\n\nOther than that, it looks like a nice piece of toro.", "That looks like jabara toro, not ideal for nigiri due to those huge fat lines. They tend to separate like in your first pic\n\nId try again with toro from a different part like kama toro (collar). It's way easier to work with"]}

My understanding is that flash freezing kills parasites. Even warmer freezing temps will kill parasites if it is prolonged freezing.\n\nNow I know that bacterial growth is a concern if the fish has thawed and refrozen, but I don't see how that risk is different from any meat you buy at the store? My understanding is that it isn't just the bacteria that is a concern, but the toxins they leave behind because cooking doesn't get rid of toxins.\n\nI know it isn't a %100 safety guarantee, but it seems reasonable to say that most frozen seafood from any regular grocery store is reasonably safe to eat.

{"title": "Is there a sub for sushi making? As in, specifically to discuss certain aspects that may too niche for broader audience", "selftext": "Subj. I want to get some opinions on my sushi vinegar blend and cutting techniques, but afraid it may be too niche for this sub.\n\nIf this is the right sub then here are my questions (in case anyone would like to share their experience):\n\n* I\u2019ve tried both Mizkan sushi rice vinegar and rice vinegar (plus sugar and salt and a bit of Mirin), using 20% of dry rice weight. Which was the suggestion on the label (4 tablespoons for 2 rice cups, which comes out to 20%). It wasn\u2019t bad at all, but the rice smelled a bit pungent compared to our local sushi restaurant that has good reviews. Their rice was a lot less vinegar\u2019y. \n\n* Roll slicing. I\u2019ve got the yanagiba (I\u2019m lucky as I have access to good knives), but sometimes my rolls are sliced with very little resistance and sometimes my knife just gets stuck in it. My knife is still very sharp, so that\u2019s not the issue. Right now my theories are: mayonnaise is what\u2019s sticking to my knife the most (so use it sparingly); or, slice the rolls RIGHT after they are made, don\u2019t wait to finish all the rolls first (so the rice changes its structure/texture while cooling down and that\u2019s what makes it harder to slice). Also, do I need to prep my nori before using it? Hold over fire (or put in a pan). Does it affect the cutting at all?\n\n\n* Preservation of sushi rice with right temperature. After I make it, my understanding is that as long as it stays body temperature \u2014 it will stay in this ready to make nigiri/rolls state for at least 30 minutes or so. Equally, on the other hand, if the rice isn\u2019t kept at the body temperature after making it (and mixing in the vinegar) then it will become unusable (too sticky and just not as yummy).

Fancy rolls and sauces are good enough but you really lose so much by masking the fish. \n\nSalmon vs tuna vs escolar vs hamachi, each is unique. You try the four grades of fatty tuna side by side and you can taste the subtleties between each cut of tuna, same with salmon and salmon belly.  You try cured salmon roe and you have something a world different from any muscle cut. Sea urchin, scallop, different types of sweet shrimp\u2026 they are all so incredibly different. \n\nSomeone who loves sushi can pick each of those out with a blindfold on. It\u2019s ok to not like nigiri. I like the fancier rolls but will usually choose to eat mostly or entirely nigiri and supplement with shared rolls for the table. For me nigiri is the real art of this cuisine and the fancy done up rolls are to get a more diverse group of people into the restaurant.", "It tastes way better than cooked fish", "its like wine.  the more you eat it in differing qualities the more you recognize the complexities.\n\n  \nThe images you provide are not very good quality as example.

If I see any signs of sub par prep, I will eat other things. \n\n  \nAt that, with salmon I would rather have smoked salmon than straight up raw. I have made smoked salmon sushi with cream cheese and it is freaking delicious.", "You just described the appeal. Everything you dislike about it is the reason everyone else loves it. The taste and texture of fresh, clean, raw seafood can be divine.", "Melts in mouth and the texture is a nice mouth feel. Soft to eat. If it\u2019s high quality, it\u2019s really buttery too. I will admit the flavor of any raw fish is pretty mild and you need to put something on it to amplify it.  Like when I put pickled ginger on salmon, it tastes sweeter.", "If you know, you know", "I didn\u2019t appreciate raw fish much until I was in college.  I had also had *a lot* of sketchy sushi where I was living previously (Missoula Montana, USA, long before there were decent sushi restaurants there).  \n\nThere\u2019s a whole spectrum of raw fish, but with a few exceptions, raw fish tends to have a subtle but pleasant flavor, satisfying texture, and sometimes buttery quality that almost sticks to your teeth.  When you use raw fish in one of those big many-ingredient rolls, a lot of this charm gets lost.  I can see why it doesn\u2019t appeal if that\u2019s how you\u2019re most familiar with it.  Personally, I prefer most foods with more than one texture, so my favorite thing ever is nigiri rather than sashimi.  Good rice + good fish is greater than the sum of its parts by an indescribable margin, but this can be hard to find depending on where you live.  \n\nAnd everyone likes their own thing!  My fianc\u00e9 was stealing her parents\u2019 sashimi from the age where she learned to walk.  I personally would have run out of the room screaming when I was that age.  Nowadays I\u2019m the opposite, but tastes and preferences change over time and sometimes you just can\u2019t learn to like something.  It\u2019s okay if a food isn\u2019t for you, but I\u2019d encourage you to try it again if you find yourself at a place known for their sashimi.  For me it was like a switch flipped in my brain, and maybe it will be for you too.", "Because it tastes good and has a nice texture. Biggest downside is the risk of parasites", "It taste like butter with a little iron to me. Texture is good too. Some fish I won\u2019t eat because they don\u2019t vibe with the buttery iron.", "Taste and texture!! Tuna is my favorite for its flavor :)", "Taste good", "Hard to put into words because I can\u2019t imagine not liking it. Liked it the first time I tried even though I was very apprehensive. I mostly stick to very mild fatty fish like salmon, tuna, the like. The buttery soft texture of fatty raw fish is just unbeatable and melts in your mouth."]}

{"title": "Making tempura", "selftext": "Hello. I have a job in a sushi restaurant. I've been working there for a couple of years as a dishwasher and server but people keep quiting so I was put with no prior experience or knowledge to fry tempura. It has been extremely hard for me. I have an extremely hard time learning things and the cook who is right next to me and teaching me yells and cusses at me everyday. He roughly grabs things out of my hand and he lightly hit my hand when I did not do it right. He is angry with me because I struggle to be fast enough and know when the tempura is done. I also have to help the cook with other things like frying crab puffs, vegetable egg rolls, microwaving things, and assisting him in things he needs help in. I have forgotten the tempura while I'm helping with other things too.  \n\nThe only part of making the tempura I am responsible for is putting it into the flour and then dipping it in batter and frying it and looking after it and then taking it out and knowing if it is done or not. I am struggling especially with the vegetable tempura. The vegetables I have the most trouble with is the cucumber, banana, and yam. I am very confused about what is considered done so I have overcooked then or undercooked them. I also do a Las Vegas Roll tempura and shrimp tempura.  I am yelled at everyday and I go to work with dread and anxiety. I really want to learn this new skill and this is a very good opportunity to me to transition to dishwasher to making tempura. \n\nCan you help me with some tips to making the tempura?\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1j2hqnb/making_tempura/", "created_utc": 1741005544.0, "score": 2, "author": "Cautious_Boss_3211", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/sushi/comments/1j2hqnb/making_tempura/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I haven\u2019t tempura\u2019d anything other than shrimp before but you can try applying a pragmatic solution: (size of cucumber/banana/yam cut) + (amount of flour dredge) + (fry oil temp) = (some perfect frying time).

Should only take a few tries per different vegetable. If you don\u2019t experiment and do the same thing over and over, the results won\u2019t change.
