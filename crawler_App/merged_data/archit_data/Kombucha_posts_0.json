Remove from heat, let sit in pan for 60-90 minutes until ginger flavor is strong. Strain out ginger, bottle syrup, store in refrigerator. Makes approx 8oz of syrup. **Edit 2/6:** I've since experimented with using fresh ginger juice instead of ginger simple syrup and have found that 0.5oz is about the right amount. If you have a juicer, try out ginger juice!\n* 1 tbsp blue spirulina powder. I bought mine online from The Reserve (no affiliation) for $15 for 30g during a sale. 30g looks like \\~5 tbsp, visually. When I make this again I'll try reducing to 1/2 tbsp to see what that does to the color - right now it's very intense.\n\nMix ingredients together (use a whisk to get the spirulina powder to mix in well) and split in half.

And then you'd be able to see like the range of gas production. \n\nLastly, but kinda why I'm commenting in the first place: you may know this already, but generally the more sugar you provide your batch during the secondary ferment (in the sealed bottle), the more carbonation and pressure you will get. Particularly early on in your journey, I'd recommend aiming for a \"dry\" kombucha where you add minimal sugar/fruit to your second ferment, until you get a feel for how much sugar you like in the drink. Even without burping, bottles shouldnt be exploding (I have made a few kombucha bombs as well that totally fucked up my fridge).

If you're wondering what's growing on your kombucha and if it's normal, you've come to the right place.\n\nPlease review this information before posting a picture of your batch to the subreddit.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Dry + fuzzy on the surface of the liquid/pellicle/SCOBY is most likely mold: mold pics [https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi](https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi)\n* Geometric growths or wrinkly patterns on the surface of the liquid/pellicle/SCOBY could be kahm yeast: kahm pics [https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox](https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox)\n* Anything else and anything under the liquid level is most likely normal: normal pics [https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv](https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv)\n* If you're not sure, wait a few more days: mold or kahm will get more obvious as they grow, normal will stay about the same or form into new pellicle/SCOBY\n* If the kombucha is already bottled for carbonation (commonly called second ferment or 2F), mold/kahm is very unlikely due to the high acidity and lack of oxygen access.\n* Always use at least 2 cups of starter per gallon (125ml/L) when making kombucha to acidify the batch: high acidity (pH < 4.6) protects the kombucha from mold and kahm. \n* Read our getting started guide for brewing tips: [https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how\\_to\\_start](https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how_to_start)\n\n**Terminology**: in this guide, \"pellicle/SCOBY\" refers to the rubbery blob that forms at the surface of a batch of kombucha. SCOBY stands for \"symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast\", and those bacteria + yeast are found both in the liquid kombucha and in the solid rubbery blob. The rubbery blob's more accurate scientific name is \"pellicle\": it's a biofilm/mat of bacterial cellulose secreted by and connected to the bacteria forming it (some yeast also live in the pellicle). Culturally, however, the term \"SCOBY\" widely refers to the pellicle so this guide uses both terms.\n\nRead more about pellicles here:\n\n* [https://fermentaholics.com/whats-that-white-waxy-layer-growing-on-my-kombucha-brew/](https://fermentaholics.com/whats-that-white-waxy-layer-growing-on-my-kombucha-brew/)\n* [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12073](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12073) (scroll to \"Tea fungus (fungal biomass) and its applications\" section)\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002013001846](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002013001846)\n\n**Diagnostic Quiz**\n\n1 ) Is the growth/odd thing on the top surface (exposed to air) of the liquid kombucha or existing pellicle/SCOBY?\n\n* Yes - go to 2\n* No - go to 8\n\n2 ) Is the kombucha already bottled for carbonation (commonly called second ferment or 2F)?\n\n* Yes - likely pellicle/SCOBY growth (it can happen in 2F!) or a yeast cluster. Mold/kahm are extremely rare in 2F due to the high acidity (pH <4.2) and lack of oxygen access (required for mold to grow). Booch on!\n* No - go to 3\n\n3 ) Is the growth dry and fuzzy looking with white or green color, and/or with black spores growing out of it?\n\n* Yes - likely mold. Go to Mold section for pictures.\n* No - go to 4\n\n4 ) Is the growth a wrinkly or geometric pattern, very rough patterned surface, or very large air-y bubbles that cover large areas of the surface?\n\n* Yes - likely kahm yeast. Go to Kahm section for pictures.\n* No - go to 5\n\n5 ) Is the growth one of: white/translucent + wet, disconnected oily/patchy sections, or a thin film with bubbles trapped underneath?\n\n* Yes - likely normal pellicle/SCOBY growth. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 6\n\n6 ) Is the growth flat, leathery, and brown?\n\n* Yes - likely a dried out pellicle/SCOBY area. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 7\n\n7 ) Is the the growth brown/black, wet, and partially/completely surrounded by pellicle/SCOBY?\n\n* Yes - likely a yeast cluster. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - probably normal, but review all Normal, Kahm, and Mold pictures to be safe.\n\n8 ) Is the growth/odd thing completely submerged in liquid?\n\n* Yes - likely yeast. Yeast can form dark brown clumps in the liquid or on the pellicle/SCOBY, or alien-like formations suspended in the liquid. Mold and kahm cannot grow beneath the surface of the liquid without also showing on the surface exposed to air. Go to Normal section for pictures.\n* No - go to 2\n\n**Normal**\n\nGallery of normal kombucha: [https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv](https://imgur.com/a/HJaENDv)\n\nPellicles/SCOBYs have a **ton** of natural variation. A normal pellicle/SCOBY should look wet, tan/white/translucent, and be mostly smooth (some bumps are normal). There may also be wet brown/black yeast blobs that attach to the liquid side of the pellicle/SCOBY, get absorbed into the pellicle/SCOBY, or float around inside the liquid.\n\n**Mold**\n\nGallery of mold: [https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi](https://imgur.com/a/SzhysHi)\n\nMold occurs when the kombucha is not acidic enough (pH < 4.6) to prevent mold organisms from growing. Other factors that make mold more likely are unsanitary conditions and cold brewing temperatures (<65F/18C).\n\nIf there is mold on your batch:\n\n* You **must throw away everything** (liquid + pellicle/SCOBY) and start from scratch with fresh starter tea. By the time mold is visible on the surface of the brew, it has already contaminated the entire batch.\n* Sanitize the vessel, cloth cover, and any utensils used in brewing with a homebrew sanitizing solution (StarSan, OneStep, SaniClean, potassium metabisulfite, etc) or throughly wash with soap + hot water followed by a pasteurized distilled vinegar rinse (no raw vinegar, which contains live microbe cultures).\n\nTo prevent mold, **the most important thing is to use at least 2 cups of starter tea per 1 gallon of kombucha (125ml per L)** to acidify the batch. Starter tea is mature kombucha: either from a previous batch (yours or a friend's), from a SCOBY hotel, or from raw/unflavored/unpasteurized commercial kombucha such as GTs or Health-Ade. \n\nThis amount of starter tea is a good rule of thumb for safe acidity: if you have a pH meter or strips, check that the starting pH is <4.6. Another important factor is maintaining clean/sanitary brewing practices: however, because kombucha is an open air ferment some mold organisms may get in even with a cloth cover, which is why acidity is also important.\n\n**Kahm Yeast**\n\nGallery of kahm: [https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox](https://imgur.com/a/XlnO7Ox)\n\n\u201cKahm\u201d is a generic term for many species of usually non-harmful but also non-desirable wild yeast that can take hold in kombucha (outcompete the kombucha culture) and appear as surface growths on the the pellicle/SCOBY. Kahm often looks geometric or wrinkly vs the smooth/bumpy normal pellicle/SCOBY.\n\nSee this excellent writeup about the science of kahm yeast from u/daileta in r/fermentation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/ytg2vy/kahm_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/ytg2vy/kahm_down/) Their post is focused on lacto fermented vegetables (not kombucha) but is worth a read. \n\nKahm itself isn\u2019t usually dangerous, but to quote our resident food microbiologist u/Albino_Echidna:  \u201cKahm is a term used to lump a whole bunch of unwanted yeasts together, all of which are indicative of an unsafe fermentation environment. Kahm growth is indicative of a fermentation gone wrong. 'Kahm' itself isn\u2019t harmful, but it is a warning sign that your environment wasn\u2019t quite right and will be at higher risk of pathogenic growth as a result.\"\n\nIf your batch has kahm, it is up to you whether to toss + sanitize + start over with fresh starter kombucha or to try to scrape off the kahm from the surface and continue brewing. **It is always safest to toss and restart** \\- see the instructions in the Mold section.\n\nTo help prevent kahm, use at least 2 cups of starter tea per 1 gallon of kombucha (125ml per L) to strongly establish the kombucha culture and acidify the batch. Kahm may also be related to unsanitary conditions, high brewing temperature (>85F/30C), or oversteeping tea (>1hr, but may vary).\n\n**Further reading:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/whats\\_wrong**](https://www.reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/whats_wrong)\n\n**If you still aren\u2019t sure after comparing your batch to the pictures here, please make a post and ask!**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/pqu7oq/is_it_mold_is_it_normal_whats_growing_in_your/", "created_utc": 1631998127.0, "score": 474, "author": "mehmagix", "num_comments": 122, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/pqu7oq/is_it_mold_is_it_normal_whats_growing_in_your/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I wrote a little poem: \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou ask if your batch is a flop  \nWith spots of white or green atop  \nWondering if mold's what it was?  \nThe giveaway is the tell-tale fuzz\n\nIn this case there'd be no doubt  \nThe next step is to throw it out  \nBut hope for tasty booch springs anew  \nFind a fresh SCOBY for your next brew!", "Absolutely the best wiki/onboarding I\u2019ve ever seen on Reddit!

How do you plan on drinking that kombucha anywhere other than your own home now? Do you realize half of your kombucha is down the sink now?

If people inform what they consider to be done wrong and/or accept our suggestions so other can learn from it. Keep on learning, that is the reason why I am here and o would say many others.\n\nSecondly, many don\u2019t actually see it as a failure, since it might be the very first time they have gotten an actual carbonation. And I have had my first two batches of low fermentation, so it was quite a good thing to have an over fermentation the first time.\n\nThird, people should be able to share their findings with no judgement on themselves (we will all judge the kombucha!). Specially on these dark times, forums like this are a great way to find comfort and a way to distract yourself. Imagining for a while that the worst thing happening is an over carbonated drink is such a good thing ;)\n\nNevertheless, we all should enjoy what we read, so maybe a tag for it that you and others who don\u2019t like it can filter on?", "Oh my goodness YEEESSSSS!!

The carbonation porn is simply annoying, and is one of 3 reasons that I may ultimately stop coming to these threads. It is a senseless waste of perfectly good kombucha. That these posts can get 100's of upvotes while solid informational posts are lucky to get a dozen, is very perplexing.\n\nThe 2nd item that might drive me away is the mold/not mold pics. Any newbie who comes here and refuses to actually read any of the excellent pinned information, really doesn't deserve all of the helpful responses they receive. A second annoyance in this is the people who immediately state that they see mold and the batch should be dumped. Most of the time the batches are just fine, if a little odd looking. \\*Let the OP decide and simply point out that fuzz=mold. Only a live inspection can determine for certain if there is mold.\n\nFinally, we reach what is fast becoming a major pet peeve for me; questions regarding \"growing scoby's\" and then proceeding to make batches of kombucha. I don't know who is perpetuating these myths about the need to grow a scoby before you can brew, but I am sick of reading about it.

I thought that's what I was sharing when I share pics or vids about F2 carbonation and what this thread is about. \n\nAll that said, there are many things that can affect carbonation and i don't think im at expert by any means.

I checked in on it once every 3-4 days and found no mold and a nice pellicle forming, so I knew the process was working. \n\nAfter 10 days, I bottled into two 16oz bottles with a teaspoon of dry sugar each. This second fermentation food turned out to be very ineffective at producing carbonation. I tried a few different ideas (homemade sweet chocolate syrup was too \u201corangey\u201d; agave syrup was ridiculously sweet; 100ml coconut water and filled up the rest of the way with Coffeebucha in a 16oz bottle gave the cleanest flavor so far, so that is where I have settled). \n\nAfter bottling, I let the second fermentation do its thing for 4 more days. I left enough Coffeebucha in the jar to act as my starter tea, so the tea kombucha was phasing out and the Coffeebucha was phasing in. I added 32oz more sweetened cold brew coffee to the jar and repeated the process. \n\nThe Coffeebucha you see in the picture is my fifth round, so pretty much all the tea kombucha starter is phased out and has converted to a pure Coffeebucha SCOBY. This is the best carbonation and flavor I have gotten so far. \n\nAnother idea I have tried with Coffeebucha is a variant on the White Russian, which I call the \u201cWhite Kentucky Hippie\u201d. It is equal parts Coffeebucha and heavy cream over ice, topped with a shot of bourbon (or perhaps a slightly longer pour, depending on the mood).", "I love cooking down coffee kombucha to use as a syrup.

Start with a tablespoon and go up to about a quarter cup for a strong ginger taste that doesn't overpower. Same amounts for juiced ginger.

You can filter it out as the flavor will remain, as with the fruit if the ginger is good quality).\n\nFor those who are new, fresh or frozen fruit is best.

Be careful using purchased juices as additives and preservatives can hinder or prevent fermentation, even kill the live bacteria in your kombucha or JUN.\n\nMaking kombucha should be fun.

More images and data at link below.[https://imgur.com/a/FwHCass](https://imgur.com/a/FwHCass)\n\n**Hypothesis:**  Steeping the base tea longer leads to more active yeast and bacterial  communities (SCOBY) during the 1F brew. Further, including a pellicle  (in addition to mature starter liquid) leads to a more 1F active brew.\n\n**Experiment:**  I don\u2019t have the time, resources, or expertise to actually test the  microbial content. Nor do I care that much. So for the purposes of this  experiment, we\u2019ll be making the assumption that bacterial/yeast activity  of the 1F brew is proportional in some way to the weight of the  pellicles produced over the course of 2 weeks.\n\nThe  base tea used is a black tea (Signature Select bags), was brewed in one  large batch, and 2cup volumes for testing were removed at intervals to  isolate the varying steeping times (5 mins, 2 hours, and 8 hours). Sugar  was added after isolating the varying brew times to ensure the same  amount of sugar was dissolved into each batch.\n\nBase tea proportions were: 10 cups of water, 7 tea bags, and \u00be cup white granulated sugar.\n\nThe  base tea was placed into 2.5 cup jars with \u00bc cup of mature starter  liquid each. Two 1F jars were used that included 22g pellicles. These  all got labeled and went into the cabinet for 2 weeks. I monitored the  temp / RH with a data logger at 30 minute intervals. In summary, these  at the jars and varies test conditions:\n\n1. 5 minute steep\n2. 2 hour steep\n3. 2 hour steep + 22g pellicle\n4. 8 hour steep\n5. 8 hour steep + 22g pellicle\n\n**Data + Conclusions:**  [Pellicle growth after 2 weeks shows a clear increase with longer  steeping times.](https://imgur.com/pDXk2k6) Including a pellicle in the tea also made dramatic  increase in pellicle growth. Based on the reasonable assumption that the  pellicle\u2019s weight is an indicator of SCOBY activity/growth, my  conclusion is that base teas steeped for longer times and included in 1F  brews with starter pellicles will yield more bacterial/yeast activity.\n\n**Some more assumptions / things I don\u2019t know:**  Obviously the bio-film (pellicle) and the liquid tea are two different  things and the little bit of research I did points to the microbial  content/activity being different in each. Just the same, I do think my  assumption that the weight of the pellicle as an indicator is a fair one. What the contributing factors within the simple conclusions of more steeping + include pellicle = more SCOBY activity... I don't know. Is it the caffeine content of the base tea?\n\nIf one was so inclined the tea (base + post 1F) could be tested, but that\u2019s not  something I can do at home (as far as I know). I included the temps/RH I  recorded, but without measuring the pellicle on the same interval, there isn\u2019t much to gain from this data. It would be interesting to  understand when the bulk of the growth is happening and how that can be  optimized base on the environment. This spreadsheet is for sourdough  bread, but I imagine a similar time-temp-inoculation relationship can be  ascertained with enough data points. [http://www.wraithnj.com/breadpics/rise\\_time\\_table/bread\\_model\\_bwraith.htm](http://www.wraithnj.com/breadpics/rise_time_table/bread_model_bwraith.htm)\n\nAnd finally, with faster growth/more activity, the ideal time to pull the 1F and stop bulk fermentation probably changes. I find that I don't have to brew for quite as long as I used to (ready in \\~a week) before I start pushing into vinegar flavor territory. Are faster brews a good thing? Is the quality affected in any way? What am i missing? So many questions!\n\n**For the haters:**  Keeping throwing your pellicles out and preaching your \u201cstarter tea is  just as good\u201d non-sense. It\u2019s clearly not. LONG LIVE THE GENERALIZED USE  OF THE WORD SCOBY (which I did a very good job of not doing in this  post).\n\n**That\u2019s all. Happy Sunday!!!**\n\nEdit: Some typos and additional conclusions.\n\nEdit 2: Lots of good discussion -- I am wiped for the day, but will summarize some of the pertinent comments tomorrow in this post.", "Statistician here, this is cool! Unfortunately it's not enough to make firm conclusions. The same process would need to be repeated a few times.\n\nAssuming that weight of the pellicle is a useful metric to assess the activity of the culture, there's a crucial component missing: Variability. We might do the same thing in the same way and get slightly different results. The degree to which those results vary will determine whether your observations here are evidence of a pattern, or just \"noise.\"\n\nA few things I didn't see mentioned were:\n\n- Pellicles retain a bit of liquid, so it makes sense that a thicker pellicle (from the \"with-pellicle\" batches) would appear to gain more weight, just from the liquid. Would need some way of accounting for this or \"draining\" the pellicle to make a better measurement.\n- Was there additional yeast/stuck to the bottom of the starter pellicles that would make those batches have a stronger inoculation? Sometimes the bottoms of mine are fairly clean, other times there's a lot of yeast.\n- Is it reasonable to assume that the starter tea was equivalent between batches? E.g., How was it divvied up? Just taking some from the top as batches came ready? Was it stirred up? Etc.\n\nNot knocking this at all. Like I said, I think it's cool, and applaud the effort and the detail provided. Just adding some considerations from experimental design and statistical analysis perspective.\n\nMight be interesting to get a chemist (I think? Maybe biologist?) to weigh in on whether the weight of pellicle means what we're assuming it to mean.", "This is exactly what i needed today after checking my latest batches! Used to steep for a long time and then read somewhere that less was better and my pellicles have been coming out like the saddest little swamp patties. Will steep longer - thanks!!", "Doesn't longer steeping cause bitterness? At least that's what I've heard", "Great stuff - the level of detail here is outstanding!\n\nMy current experiment is to steep more tea bags for less time and see what happens. My current observation is that it seems slightly more vinegary and slightly less yeasty this way..", "Really interesting! As someone else mentioned I think taking pH levels will provide a more concrete result, especifically when it comes to a starter pellicle. One of the major confounding issues I see is that cellulose (which most of the pellicle is) is biosynthesized by the polymerization of glucose (chaining short molecular units end to end), which I believe would mean it would proceed much faster if there was already cellulose there to start with. I could very much see it being the case that the pellicle and non-pellicle batches actually fermented at roughly the same rate as measured by sugar consumption and acid production, but that the starter pellicle provided an initial site for the polymerization to start and led to faster or more concentrated growth of the pellicle - if we assume the null hypothesis (the pellicle does nothing) is true, which we should when doing an experiment, that would mean the pellicle just speeds up pellicle growth. Think of it like dropping a crystal into a supersaturated solution - it will crystalize on its own if you wait long enough, but giving the crystals a place to start growing speeds it up exponentially. Regardless this is really cool, we need more science in this community! Would love to see a follow up with some replication and pH values in the future.", "Wow this is incredible knowledge!! I'm just about to start another batch, I will definitely try an 8 hour steep plus the pellicle. Thank you for sharing!", "Hmm, curious now what will happen if I don't remove the tea until 1F is finished. I think I'll try this.", "Thank you and great informative post. I am glad you mentioned the quickness of your brews resulting in vinegar flavor, I have noticed this and you have helped me realize that the composition of my tea has changed over time and that it doesn't require as long to brew. I recently shortened my 2F to 3-5 days, down from 7-10. Much better results.", "This is very cool! I've anecdotally noticed this as well when I've forgotten to transfer the steeped tea and left it out overnight.", "I was just wondering about this! I had been doing 24 hour steeps and was just about to try a 3 minute steep as I have been reading more on tea and the best practices for brewing it. I was watching someone on youtube who did a 1 hour steep at 181 degrees F. Which I thought was interesting because I bring my water to a full boil at 212 degrees F. Then add my tea. I guess there are a lot of ways of doing things and I\u2019m thankful you have documented it for everyone!", "I'm currently testing a hypothesis that you can get more carbonation when only using the starter liquid. It seems like when I use the pellicle it F1 is shorter but the carbonation is significantly less. I think it has something to do with the amount of oxygen available and the pellicle blocks some of the oxygen but I'm not sure yet.", "8 hour is my favorite, that's a good looking scoby.", "Just to be clear: when you steep the tea for X time, it doesn\u2019t mean you do anything to keep it hot for the whole steep time, do you?\n\nReason I ask, and I find it cool so many of us have been tinkering with this steep question, is I have been experimenting with steeping in hot water for extended periods.  So when I get the water to 200F and apply the tea bags, I have the steeping tea in a double pot, applying heat to keep the tea near the 200F.  I also apply a lid so as to keep the moisture and anything else in.  I figure if I am able to smell the tea, those molecules are tea molecules leaving the batch.\n\nSo many unknowns.  I will check this thread out tomorrow S I hope more scientific minds chime in.", "This was a super interesting read, thanks so much for sharing! Recently I\u2019ve been steeping 24 hours (just works best with the schedule right now - black tea, loose in the pot and strained out before transfer into the jar with pellicle and starter liquid). I\u2019ve definitely noticed a huge difference in the pellicle growth with the longer steep time. Prior I would only let steep a few hours, the pellicle was good but nothing like the growth I\u2019ve seen lately. Thanks again for sharing your well thought out experiment. :)", "If you're just trying to optimize for pellicle formation, start using honey instead of sugar: equal mass sugar to what you use normally, honey is about 75% sugar by weight. I routinely get a half inch within a week when doing so (and I throw it out between every batch, so no \"starter pellicle\").", "Was the mature start liquid just compounded from each of these ? That is to say the 2 hour's starter liquid came from the 5 min's 1f, the 8 hours came from the 2 hours brew?\n\nI ask namely cause I feel to be a proper comparison they all need to come from an equal starting place and an equal starting liquid. I often find I don't just have ONE bad batch, I have 2 or 3 in a row until my SCOBY rebalances itself.\n\nI'd be more interested in the difference between the starter pellicle and it's new growth on the bottom. Not the sum of the starter and new growth. Please correct me if I misread and the picture IS the difference!", "For the 2 and 8 hour steeping did you aim to maintain a certain water temperature, did you initially bring the liquid to a boil and then let it cool under ambient conditions, or did you do something else?\n\nAlso, great post and explanatory comment. We need to produce and encourage content like this to cut through any misinformation which might otherwise confuse people new to kombucha.", "Firstly, I am very grateful OP that you've taken the time to contribute this experiment to our community.  I think it is of great value.\n\nHowever, I think it is important to define what exactly its value is, and that is what I hope this post achieves.\n\nThere is a Conclusion and TLDR section at the end of this post.\n\nIt should be noted from the outset that I firmly believe the distinction between SCOBY and pellicle is important in order to provide clarity -- it eases both discussion and future experimentation such as this.  In the following paragraphs I will address OPs bias, and I want to acknowledge that I have my own as well.  Future readers should empathize with both perspectives in order to reach a broader understanding of the culture we love.\n\n-----\n\n**Hypothesis Testing Methodology**\n\nAs a mathematician (I teach math) I use hypothesis testing more than most, in part because it is required in my profession, and in part because I enjoy it more than most.  For all generic hypothesis testing there are actually *two* hypothesis.  It is statistically significant that these are worded *identically* with the only distinction being that the null is written in the negative:\n\nThe Null Hypothesis - claims that a change in the dependent variable has no effect on the independent variable (ex: steep times have no effect on culture virility)\n\nThe Alternative Hypothesis - claims that a change in the dependent variable does have an effect on the independent variable (ex: steep times have an effect on culture virility)\n\nTo avoid confirmation bias and leaps in logic, it is imperative that the experimenter attempts to *reject* the null hypothesis rather than *prove* the alternative.\n\nIn this experiment, OP has sought only to affirm the alternative hypothesis -- that steep times do matter -- in part due to the preconceived notions and biases that OP themself acknowledge.\n\n-----\n\n**Using the Null Hypothesis**\n\nLet's use this better understanding of hypothesis testing to re-examine this experiment.\n\nUsing the null and alternative hypothesis defined above (which I've tried to keep as true to OPs intentions as possible), and using OPs observational data, can we reach the same conclusion as OP?\n\nNo.  OPs observational data does not examine culture virility, it examines pellicle weight, so there is no data to disprove the null and therefore accept the alternative.  OP accepted the alternative, which is a [Type II statistical error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors).\n\nWe can reuse OPs data, however, with modified hypothesis:\n\nNull Hypothesis: Steep times have no effect on pellicle weight    \nAlternative Hypothesis: Steep times have an effect on pellicle weight\n\nNow we *can* reject the null, which makes the alternative hypothesis true, and reveals the statistical significance of this experiment:\n\nWe may conclude from this experiment that increased steep times increase cellulose coagulation and pellicle formation in OPs kombucha culture.\n\n-----\n\n**Conjectures**\n\nAt the outset OP notes:    \n>  I don\u2019t have the time, resources, or expertise to actually test the microbial content. Nor do I care that much.\n\nTherefore, all of this very high quality data collection that I am so appreciative of has been unfortunately misused.  OP knows therefore that the purported hypothesis is not actually the real hypothesis of the experiment at all.  Its being used to defend conjecture.\n\nThis leaves us all wondering: \"So *is* increased cellulose production (pellicle development) indicative of increased culture virility?\"\n\nI don't know.  And I don't have the means to test, same as OP.  But...\n\n-----\n\n**More cellulose=?=More virility**\n\nAs I said immediately above, I don't know.  But I do have access to a fantastic journal article that sheds light on how exactly cellulose is formed (among many other things):\n\n[Understanding Kombucha Tea Fermentation: A Review](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01945573)\n\nAt this point I could insert my own assumptions and preconceptions (I did and then deleted it).  Instead I will simply encourage you to *read that journal article*.  It is the single greatest resource I have ever come across for understanding the kombucha culture.\n\n-----\n\n**Additional Musings**\n\nOP, at the end of their post, seems to make a further leap of logic -- that those of us who insist on distinguishing between \"SCOBY\" and \"pellicle\" are the same group of people who insist that the pellicle is arbitrary.  Being part of the latter may imply inclusion in the former, but the opposite is not so!    \nI include a pellicle in all my new batches.  I distinguish it as a pellicle so new brewers do not falsely assume that it is solely responsible for fermentation, but I wholly acknowledge that it has some influence on final product.\n\nMy intent of this post is only to illuminate the hypothesis testing error OP made.  I recognize it may come across as negative, which is largely because I have seen the dangerous effects of Type II errors many times and it troubles me.\n\nAs others have noted, culture virility is crucial, but will always be second to final flavor -- as that is why we do what we do.  Longer steep times are not desirable if they negatively impact final flavor.\n\nLong steep times have been linked to excess release of lead and other heavy metals.  See [this study](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jt/2013/370460/).  The tea plant is exceptional at purifying soil of heavy metals -- unfortunately this is transferred to the leaves and finally to our cups.  We must also consider that soils in China - a leading producer of tea - are more highly contaminated with lead due to leaded petroleum products being permissible until very recently.\n\n-----\n\n**In conclusion; TLDR**\n\nOPs test is valuable, and contains statistically significant data.  It proves that longer steep times and the inclusion of a pellicle increase cellulose coagulation.\n\nOPs test does *not* prove that longer steep times leads to a more virile culture, nor does it prove that including a pellicle leads to a more virile culture.\n\nSteeping tea for long periods of time may have other detrimental effects not discussed by OP (see last two points in \"Additional Musings\".\n\nRead the linked [journal article](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01945573) as it is incredible, and will give far more insight into the kombucha culture than either OPs post or this one."]}

{"title": "Reddit Master Kombucha Recipe", "selftext": "**Master Kombucha Recipe** - Standard Batch Method\n\nThis recipe is for a 1 gallon or 4 liter batch of kombucha. Use the same proportions for larger batches.\n\nProportions | \u2018Merican | Metric\n--------|-------|-------\nBrew Jar Volume | 1 Gallon | 4 Liters\nTea | 2-3 Tbsp loose, or 7-10 bags| 15-20 Grams\nWater | 12 Cups | 3 Liters\nSugar | 1 Cup | 225 Grams\nSCOBY Starter | 2 Cups | .5 Liter\nSCOBY Pellicle | 1 | 1\n\n**Ingredients:** Try to use high quality ingredients (filtered water, organic sugar and tea), but it's not necessary. The tea is generally a mix of green and black tea, or can be all green or all black. Different teas will differ by weight/volume, so use your own preferences as to how much.\n\n\n**SCOBY = Pellicle + Starter:** Ideally, both pellicle and starter should be used. The starter liquid contains the main culture and should be fully-brewed, plain, unpasteurized Kombucha from a previous batch, from a friend, or from a commercial bottled product. The pellicle is the layer of cellulose that forms on top of the brew to create a protective barrier and control gas exchange. As the pellicle grows with each batch, remove older layers to keep it about one inch thick or less. \n\nIf you do not have a SCOBY pellicle to start with, it's OK to use only the starter liquid and grow a new pellicle. The pellicle does contain some culture, so if you have only a pellicle and no starter liquid, you can substitute with about half the volume of distilled white vinegar or pasteurized apple cider vinegar in order to lower the pH and allow the culture to thrive, which may take a few extra days.  \n\n\n**Containers:** One large glass brewing jar and several glass bottles. Bottles should be sealable air-tight and able to hold pressure, such as swing-tops bottles or re-capped beer bottles. Mason jars, recycled GT bottles, or wine bottles not recommended.\n\n\n**Brewing and Fermenting:**  \n1. Bring half of the water to boil, turn off heat, add the tea and let steep according to type of tea and your preference.\n2. Remove bags or strain out tea leaves, and then add sugar, stirring to dissolve.  \n3. Add the remaining water, should be as cold as possible. Let this sweet tea sit as needed to cool to room temperature.  \n4. Pour the SCOBY starter into the jar, then add the sweet tea, leaving room to then gently float the SCOBY pellicle on top of the tea. It's OK if it sinks.  \n5. Cover with a fine mesh cotton cloth secured with a rubber band. Let sit 7-14 days at warm room temperature, in a cupboard or out of direct sunlight for the first fermentation.  The length of first fermentation is highly dependent on ambient temperature.\n6. Begin tasting the brew with a straw at about 6 days. It's ready when it tastes good to you. Should be sour and not too sweet.  Be patient.\n\n\n**Bottling and Flavoring:**  \n1. Pour using a funnel into clean glass bottles for the second fermentation.  \n2. Reserve 2 cups for the starter for your next batch.\n3. *Optional:* If you want to boost carbonation, add a small amount of sugar to the bottle, approx 1 tsp per 16oz bottle.  \n4. You can also add juice, chopped or blended fruit, ginger, herbs, spices, etc. to the second ferment to both add flavors and boost carbonation. To prevent over-carbonation, *do not add both sugar and juice/fruit.*  \n5. Seal the bottles air-tight and let sit at least 2 days in warm temp, and up to 7 days in cool temp.\n6. Put in the fridge to chill and it's ready to drink.  \n\n*This recipe is based on input gathered from r/Kombucha [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/59rw0l/can_we_make_a_reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5a35gw/draft_2_reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/).*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/", "created_utc": 1478239097.0, "score": 302, "author": "Balsamicon", "num_comments": 124, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Just cracked my first brew!

No suggestion for vessel size but the 4L vessel for 3L of water seems about right so that's 1.33L of vessel space for each 1L of water.\n\nFor the above 3L recipe I'd suggest that 210g of sugar is closer to the 1 cup of sugar (approx. 200g)  for 12 US cups (2.84L) of water. Indeed 210g is also spot on with the metric recipe I was given. I suppose the extra 15 grams won't do any harm though.\n\nOn the tea quantity I refer to this link https://www.teatulia.com/tea-101/how-to-measure-loose-leaf-tea-for-brewing.htm\n\nThe joys of mixing up different units (2 grams per 8 US fluid oz.), but that suggests 8.45g/L or about 25g of tea for 3L of water. Though I'm finding the 7g/L (21g for 3L) in my recipe is plenty strong enough.\n\nBased on the fairly standard guideline to use 10% SCOBY starter to brewed tea quantity, then I'd say that 300ml is plenty enough for 3L.

{"title": "Can we stop confusing the pellicle and SCOBY?", "selftext": "Similar to another recent thread [\"Can we stop bragging about overcarbed 2F?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gttsqj/can_we_stop_bragging_about_overcarbed_2f/), I feel its also time to make a post to clarify that your SCOBY and your pellicle **are not the same thing**.\n\nI know. You watched a bunch of videos where some guy points at mushy pancake looking thing, calls it a SCOBY, and you go on watching, no reason to ever question the teacher. You are the student after all. But some times a lesson we need to learn in life is that teachers aren't always right. Some times they were taught wrong by a teacher, who was also taught wrong, and now, they're gonna teach you just the same. The cycle never breaks. And we stay intellectually stuck. You come to this sub, and since half the people think like you do you encounter the same mistake never realizing its a mistake. Heck, even the wiki probably has it wrong.\n\nWhen I first started out, I too was duped into thinking I needed to buy a [12$ \"SCOBY\"](https://www.amazon.com/Fermentaholics-Kombucha-Twelve-Starter-Culture/dp/B01N7S1CV5/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?cv_ct_cx=kombucha+starter&dchild=1&keywords=kombucha+starter&pd_rd_i=B01N7S1CV5&pd_rd_r=6fdea165-30b5-479d-b57f-6731d9f02bca&pd_rd_w=UrskJ&pd_rd_wg=zPnx1&pf_rd_p=1da5beeb-8f71-435c-b5c5-3279a6171294&pf_rd_r=BX94XY5YQFDF8CD79HN7&psc=1&qid=1591205965&sr=1-1-70f7c15d-07d8-466a-b325-4be35d7258cc). In fact, I bought 3, one for my very first 1 gallon jar. Then I was dumb enough to buy 2 more when I wanted to upgrade to 5 gallons because I thought my \"SCOBY wasn't big enough\". I'm willing to admit I was naive and dumb until I finally thought about it for a minute. And its time this sub come around and admit it too so we can start growing our breadth of knowledge like other more mature brewing communities. (FYI, kombucha isnt the only type of beverage that uses a SCOBY)\n\nThe SCOBY is the liquid. SCOBY stands for Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast. The pellicle is a waste product of the bacteria, mostly cellulose. Please notice, cellulose isn't in the acronym S.C.O.B.Y. Its effectively bacteria poop. Its important insofar as it means your bacteria is healthy. Otherwise it is not necessary and can be thrown away. Just like carbonation is important to gauge the health of your yeast. CO2 is the waste product of yeast. No one goes around thinking we need CO2 to start our cultures. So why do we think we so need a pellicle?\n\nSo what is a SCOBY? Its your liquid. You can refer to this liquid as \"starter liquid\" at the time of starting a new batch. Or you can refer to as \"kombucha\" at literally any time. They are the same thing. A mother culture is simply the culture you used to inoculate a new colony. Sometimes brewers designate a strong batch, as in a very healthy and acidic colony as the starter for all new brews. But dont confuse this with a \"SCOBY hotel\". You dont need a bunch of pellicles. You do however need to know that your colony is healthy, and if it is, it should be producing a pellicle. *But you dont need the pellicle*.\n\nHere's why the distinction matters. Once we know the liquid is actually the SCOBY and the pellicle is bacteria poop these questions become nonsensical:\n\n* [How do I transport my SCOBY?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gvtqc0/transporting_scoby/) Answer: have you ever seen kombucha in a bottle?\n* [I need to create a hotel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gv7ve5/scoby_hotel/) Why? If the pellicle is poop then why do you want a jar of poop?\n* [Are my SCOBYS too far gone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/guihei/are_my_scobys_too_far_gone/) Yes. You left a bunch of poop in a jar and the poop did what poop does: attract bugs and other infestations.\n* [Why is my SCOBY misshapen?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/gui14u/started_making_a_scoby_about_3_weeks_ago_and_is/) It doesnt matter. Liquid has no shape.\n* [What do you do with your SCOBY while cleaning your vessel?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/grov0n/what_do_you_do_with_your_scoby_while_cleaning/) Again, bottles hold liquids.\n* [My SCOBY wont stay down](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/grbl51/1f_scoby_wont_stay_down/) It doesnt matter where the pellicle is at since you dont need it.\n\nI have also seen questions like:\n\n* Can I fold my SCOBY?\n* Can I cut my SCOBY with a knife to share with friends?\n* Is my SCOBY big enough to use for X gallons? (this was the very first question I posted to this sub)\n\nI apologize if your post has made my list here, I am not trying to single you out and make fun of you, its just these questions dont make any sense.\n\nUltimately, what I'm really trying to say is please dont go buying pellicles from someone because you think you need one. Not to single out fermentaholics, but they give you just a cup of liquid for 12$. That's about half your standard 16 oz bottle. You can get a raw unflavored bottle for [maybe 3$](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GT-s-Synergy-Organic-Kombucha-Watermelon-Wonder-16-fl-oz/438028947). Do the math. That means fermentaholics is selling you a cup of liquid + some dead bacteria poop you dont actually need for 8x the price! **That is a 700% markup!** Just because people dont know any better. Just find a bottle of raw unflavored kombucha. Technically you can use flavored kombucha too, it'll just take a few batches to ferment out the flavor to become \"plain\". It just needs to say raw/live. \n\nThank you for reading my ted talk / rant.

Its hard to endure people using a backronym that is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of how the consortium of bacteria and yeast accomplish fermentation.  We've revived so much lost knowledge about how to brew kombucha effectively, and to move any further forward in scientific discovery it is time we use appropriate scientific terminology.\n\nHowever, I must agree with u/rawrghost and the many who will defend the SCOBY side of this disagreement -- your tone undermines your goal.  I've been guilty of this before myself.  There have been plenty of threads similar to this for people to search and read.  To further \"pellicle\" usage the best thing we can do is rationally and calmly explain the difference to newcomers who are notably confused, and always defend the importance of proper and precise terminology in threads that take a more serious or scientific tone.  Best not to force this distinction into places it doesn't belong.\n\nThere is also a lack of scientific study on the effects of the pellicle.  As it impacts the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide it definitely plays an important role in 1F.

I've had this dream of building and growing our very own kombucha brand since late 2017 when I first tried it while living in NYC. \nThen I moved to Paris and despite trying many different brands and tastes, I couldn't find one that was enjoyable to drink.\nIn all the above mentioned brewers' offence, I must admit that making good kombucha is pretty damn hard and there's a tedious learning curve for it. I still don't know if I got there yet, but sure managed to drastically improve the results along the way. \nHopefully, I'll soon scale up and start producing it for the public.\nKombucha is still a very controversial drink, but I feel that just like with beer, there should be a kombucha for every taste. That's why i only follow my own rules (within reason).\n\nI hope to get everything ready by the end of this spring and start producing it under a brand. I'll definitely love to share the journey here with everyone.\n\n*\n\nPS1: Not all scobies are perfect, I get a 75/25 ratio of good/ok looking ones. \n\nPS2: I am not a world famous surgeon haha, just a random art director."]}

These \u201cprobiotic cultures\u201d only stay viable with a balance of sugars to eat and nitrogen & oxygen to \u201cbreathe\u201d just to put it simply; when these are out of balance is when you get the different \u201cexplosions\u201d of brewing kombucha.

Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\n**The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end.

I def think it could be a good, healthier replacement for beer or they even make actual hard kombucha if you want it to have a more similar alcohol content. If you drink super often just be careful if you stop suddenly bc alcohol withdrawal can be deadly and most ppl who aren\u2019t hardcore alcoholics don\u2019t even realize they are physically dependent until they try and stop drinking for a couple days. Kombucha has alcohol in it too but it\u2019s usually such a small amount that it wouldn\u2019t give you a buzz or anything especially if you drink regularly. Also even if they did add sugar after the fermentation process, it\u2019s still no where near as unhealthy as beer or other alcohols that literally damage every organ in your body. Plus alcohol is like straight sugar anyway so even if there\u2019s not added sugar in your beer, your body is still processing it as a simple carbohydrates so not only is it straight up empty calories but it also slows your metabolism and hurts your gut microbiome.

I don't think I've ever gotten that much carbonation in 1F", "10 days fermenting in  @75-80 degree office", "Great work u/gsdde! Oh, the joys of home (read: office) fermentation. From my experience with both home and commercial KT brews, I can take an educated guess at whats going on here. \n\nFermenting at a constant 75-80f is putting the yeast KT into overdrive--it is the yeast that produces carbon dioxide as it feeds on the sugars. A lot of ppl put more emphasis on the bacteria/probiotics in KT and neglect the importance of the yeast (SCOBY: it's all about symbiosis yo). Which brings me to my next point. If you aren't pouring out all the yeast on the bottom of your jar and/or are doing a continuous brew cycle then the yeast will culminate in the F1 cycle and often creates  \"one stir volcano fizz.\" \n\nAdditionally, if you have a thick multilayered healthy pellicle (often referred as the actual mother SCOBY) sitting on top of the liquid for 10 days (especially with a small neck jar as seen in the video) then you're in fact creating a 'loose cap' on the liquid which only allows carbonation to exit on the side of the jar from time to time, instead of free-flow exchange that comes with a small layered pellicle and wide-mouth glass jars (Note: as widely known, a pellicle isn't necessary for fermentation--just the starter liquid with appropriate pH). \n\nLastly, your ratio of starter liquid to new sweet tea plays a big part in how the carbon dioxide builds. It is a lot of fun to play with the ratios in your batches to see how it imparts different flavors. Interestingly, if you have a lot of yeast or collect the yeast and reserve, and intentionally introduce too much yeast into your F2 bottles, you can produce an alcoholic version that reaches 2.5-5% abv fairly easily (with bottle burping or bubble airlock in F2).\n\nSide notes: For F2 everyone needs to be using round shaped glass bottles, it's just simple physics. And not using round safe bottles when capping live fermentation is irresponsible and dangerous.  \n\nSide notes: For those that struggle to get the carbonation they want in F2, y'all need to add a dab of fructose or sucrose to the mixture to help reinvigorate the yeast after a F1. Don't strain the yeast out, if you don't like drinking unfiltered kombucha filter at the time of drinking, after the fermentation and chilling period. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for sharing the video.

I will post some pictures immediately following this one (apparently I cant add a video & pixs in same posting). \n\nF1: Brew 1 gallon organic green tea, add 1 cup sugar, cool to room temp, remove tea bags, add 12 oz starter brew with reusable pellicle and cover with blue paper towel (type used in car shops - nice thick weave and doesn\u2019t shed particles), wrap in Propagate heat mat with Propagate Pro thermostat at 74 degrees, store in dark cabinet for 1 week. \n\nF2: Add 1 tablespoon sugar & brew to 16oz Grolsch type bottle, seal and shake.  Store in same dark cabinet on Propagate mats for at least 4 weeks and as much as 6 weeks.  I used a \u201ccontrol\u201d bottle with pressure gauge and wait until it achieves at least 20 PSI.  Then I refrigerate, pop open, strain and consume.\n\nIn the summer I don\u2019t bother with the Propagate mats. \n\nThanks.", "url": "https://v.redd.it/wbswpcd3gsqa1", "created_utc": 1680125628.0, "score": 231, "author": "BigZero", "num_comments": 44, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1261f3u/new_to_the_community_not_new_to_brewing/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Looks tasty!", "That\u2019s a long F2!

Amount of tea should be in grams/L so it can be scaled up and down. And starter and sugar should just be listed as a percentage of the total liquid volume. Learning bakers percentage helps with more than just baking. For my booch I use 7 g/L of loose tea, 10% starter and 10% sugar of total volume. I'm an American who loathes Imperial measurements, why the fuck can't we just all go to metric please?!

And yes, we left the industrial closet, actually outgrowing two factories. This rag-tag operation is what became known as Rise Kombucha (https://risekombucha.com/).\n\nIn 2014, I left Rise Kombucha to start my company, Mannanova (https://www.mannanova.com/), where I brew kombucha while educating, consulting, and training the next generation of brewers. I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of clients all over the world, helping them develop kombucha brewing methods that work best and spreading fermentation culture everywhere.\n\nIn order to keep practicing, and innovating, we also run a boutique kombucha production in the heart of Montreal, Canada, producing 700L every week using seasonal ingredients. We also make batches of other fermented products like hundreds of kilos of kimchi. We\u2019re constantly innovating to make products like sak\u00e9 and penis-shaped kombucha scobys. And, last year, in order to help more people, and to reduce our carbon footprint, we put our commercial kombucha course online: it\u2019s called the Kombucha Masterclass https://kombuchamasterclass.com/\n\nI also somehow became the coauthor of Fermentation Revolution, a cooking book with 70 easy recipes for sauerkraut, kombucha, kimchi and more. That also technically makes me a cofounder of https://fermentationrevolution.com/\n\nMy Proof: https://imgur.com/a/lBnU78E", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/ft2ifm/ive_been_brewing_kombucha_for_10_years_at_every/", "created_utc": 1585756935.0, "score": 224, "author": "Thatkombuchaguy", "num_comments": 191, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/ft2ifm/ive_been_brewing_kombucha_for_10_years_at_every/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Is this mold????", "What are your favorite flavors?\n\nWhat\u2019s the weirdest kombucha-related experiment you\u2019ve done?", "What brix and pH do you target for the beginning of a batch and what is your ideal finish at?", "I was already very intrigued, but then I read the phrase \"penis-shaped kombucha scobys\" and now I'm truly fascinated.

Sustained temps above 84 and below 76 will lead to imbalance and can throw your culture out of symbiosis and the dominance of either yeast or bacteria. This is true for the primary fermentation.\n\nIn regards to the 2f in the bottle, based on my understanding, temps can be allowed to get slightly lower without many drawbacks. Dropping below 76 will start to slow things down. I can't speak with certainty how it will behave with sustained high temps. My intuition and experience leads me to believe that 80\u00b0 is the sweet spot, either in the bottle or the brewer.\n\nBut perhaps you're enjoying your results. Either way, do what work best for your tastes and preferences. I would not recommend keeping your primary ferment at temps above 84 for any sustained amount of time.

The starting pH of the hard booch (once everything was mixed together) was 3.6. Final pH of the hard kombucha was 2.75.\n\nI used a 1 gallon jar with an airlock and a heating belt to keep the temperature at 70F.\n\nI have a small kitchen scale that I use to keep track of the weight of the jar every day or two. I use a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l1an0rBb_qV4DXV-AZbR3Usy49tCWOsIzngPFfiun-c/edit?usp=sharing) that does all the calculations to tell me how much sugar remains and what the ABV of the hard booch is currently at.For this batch, I measured the ABV using both the weight (measuring how much CO2 is produced) and a refractometer. The ABV was between 6.0 and 6.6% on day 11, which was my target ABV. Note: in the spreadsheet picture, I didn't update the refractometer readings everyday. I only made six measurements over the 11 days.\n\nOn day 7, I took a cup of 1F kombucha (from my normal kombucha) and I mixed it with half a cup of crushed raspberries. I let that kombucha sit (covered with a coffee filter) until day 11 when I added it to my hard booch and then bottled it all.I did a 24 hour 2F with my hard booch to build up some carbonation. I think I should have done one more day to get a little bit more. Then I moved the hard booch to the refrigerator for 24 hours before I tasted it.\n\nThe taste is pretty good. The raspberry flavour is good. It's nice and tart. The alcohol taste isn't too strong and I think it will age well.\n\nThis is the first time I used the fermaid k. It was cheap at my local homebrew store ($3). I think it helped a little. I've made hard booch with this yeast before and 10-18 days is a pretty normal fermentation time.\n\nEdit: the spreadsheet I linked to has data from a previous batch.", "thank you from the bottom of my buch loving heart", "I\u2019m So impressed with your spreadsheet!

Unless you're going to add preservatives or heat it or something? You can always airlock the scoby to kill off the bacteria(acetobacters) and leave you with a yeast culture that will produce booze. An even quicker way is adding alcohol to the scoby. 10 percent ABV is gonna destroy pretty much all of the bacteria, guaranteed. \n\nSo you no longer have kombucha.... Kombucha flavored, maybe. You've killed most of the probiotics. And leaving it sealed, you are giving a solid middle finger to the scoBACTERIAy. They needs oxygen. That's the heart and soul of kombucha. It's not the booze. It's what the bacteria turn that booze into."]}

{"title": "FAQ and master recipe - check here first!", "selftext": "#RECIPE\n\nIngredient | US (Imperial system) | EU (Metric system)\n-- | --: | --:\nWater | 1 qt or 4 cups | 1 L\nSugar | 1/4 cup | 70 g\nBlack tea | 3 bags or 1 tbsp | 7 g\nScoby starter liquid | 1/2 cup | 0.1 L\n*note: scale amounts up or down as you wish*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Brew the sweet tea. Let it cool until it reaches room temperature. Alternatively, brew a smaller batch of hot sweet tea, and add cold water to bring it to room temperature.\n\n2. Combine sweet tea with starter culture (this can just be kombucha from the previous batch) in your brewing vessel. You can include a pellicle, or pieces of it, if you choose - but it is not a requirement. If this is your very first brew, it is beneficial to double the amount of starter liquid. This will bring down the PH-level from the start, and help keep away mold.\n\n3. Cover the vessel with a fine breathable cloth (or coffee filters) that will let air pass through but not bugs or dust. Cheesecloth is not suitable; the holes are too big! Use a rubber band to secure the cloth tightly.\n\n4. Leave it to sit in a warm corner of the house (no direct sunlight, indirect is fine). Minimum recommended temperature is 65F or 18C, with optimum around 80F/27C.  After about a week, you can begin tasting it. Does it taste too sweet? Leave it alone for a while longer. Does it taste perfect? Bottling time! Brew time depends ENTIRELY on preference.\n\n5. For bottling (\"2F\"), add either fruit juice, fruit, or sugar (*don't use square bottles*). This will help create carbonation/fizz. If fruit juice, add 10-20%. Sugar, try to start out with a tea spoon per bottle (1L/4 cups), and adjust based on experimentation. If fruit - again, experiment, or check what other people have done by scrolling through the posts. If you need flavour inspiration, [check this chart](https://i.redd.it/0d72isivpts21.png).\n\n6. The bottles should sit at room temperature for anywhere between 1 and 7 days, to create enough fizz. It depends on amount of sugar, the strength of your kombucha etc. Check them daily to see if they \"pop\", this ensures you don't get bottle explosions as well. You don't have to check all the bottles each day - check one of them, and the next day choose a different one, and so forth. Once ready, they go in the fridge.\n\n\nNote: There is a process description with pictures here: https://imgur.com/a/TwS0UMU .\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n#FAQ\n\n\n###I don't understand all these strange words\n* Pellicle: cellulose layer that forms on top of kombucha (also sometimes referred to as \"scoby\")\n* Scoby: symbiotic culture of yeast and bacteria - the liquid that makes kombucha work\n* Starter liquid: when kombucha has finished fermenting, can be used to start a new culture\n* 1F: first fermentation, mixing sweet tea and starter liquid\n* 2F: second fermentation, where you block the air supply, and you begin to generate fizz\n* 3F: optional third fermentation, people use this if they strain out fruit from their 2F\n* CB: continuous brewing, a method where you keep refilling the same vessel with new tea\n\n&nbsp;\n###My scoby pellicle sunk\nYes, a new one will form at the surface in short order. If you are using an existing SCOBY to start a new batch, don\u2019t expect the pellicle to keep floating at the top \u2013 it is normal for it to fall down!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Is this mold\nProbably not. The pellicle can look very nasty, which is often mistaken for mold. Mold will *always* be on the surface, in contact with air. It will be black, blue, white or brown, and it will be fuzzy. If you are unsure, wait a couple of days, and see if the spots grow bigger and/or more hairy. There are some great mold/not mold pictures to be found [here](https://www.kombuchakamp.com/kombucha-mold-information-and-pictures).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###There\u2019s a bunch of gross looking brown strands or clumps in my kombucha\nYou are looking at long strands or batches of yeast, this is perfectly normal! Just really nasty looking. \n\n&nbsp;\n###Do I need to have a pellicle to start brewing kombucha?\nWhat you need is a starter culture, which can include the pellicle. But it is not strictly necessary. In most cases you can start your own culture from store bought kombucha, as long as it's unpasteurized, and preferably raw - no added fruit, as those can cause mold in your first brew. The \"you need a mother to start\" was a myth for a very long time, so you will still see many sites and books claim it to be the case.\n\n&nbsp;\n###Do I need to use filtered, reverse osmosis, or distilled water for my brew?\nIt's normally not required, but in some cases it could be a good idea. Some municipalities include high amounts of chlorine in the water, which is removed by reverse osmosis and activated carbon filters (like Brita filters). Chlorine is added to water to kill microorganisms, and you\u2019re trying to grow them, so it\u2019s not a good match. Water can often just taste bad for other reasons, so just as you might use filtered water for tea or coffee, use it for your kombucha too!\n\n&nbsp;\n###I have little scoby pellicles growing in my bottles. Is this normal?\nYep! Some fermentation will continue in the bottle, even if it\u2019s refrigerated, just at a slower rate. \n\n&nbsp;\n###I\u2019m not getting any fizz in second fermentation! Help!\nFizz is a very fickle thing, and often it will grow stronger as you go through more brew cycles, cultivating your yeast population. Check to see if your bottles are good enough, they need to seal tight. Try to leave less headspace in the bottle. Try to add more sugar, or add fruit for your 2F. Pineapple/ginger is considered the most fizzy combo. Try to let the second fermentation continue longer.\n\n&nbsp;\n###Which bottles should I use?\nThe best thing is to buy bottles specifically designed for fermented beverages (pressure rated). However if those are not available to you, many people have had success with Grolsch beer bottles, as well as the ALDI lemonade bottles with swing top lids. **Avoid** square bottles at any cost, they are more likely to explode, as the pressure is exerted at the four corners, instead of uniformly distributed around the whole bottle.\n\n&nbsp;\n###Can I make it more alcoholic?\nYes you can make booch with for instance cider yeast, champagne yeast, beer or wine yeast - which will take you to upwards of 20% abv. For that you need to buy the yeast (try eBay) and an airlock.

You can put a towel under the jar and push the jar back a bit when not in use.

The temp it\u2019s reading is 3deg higher than what the temp strip on the jug is reading. Is your room warmer than the liquid? \n\nI use a thermowell and keep the temp probe in the liquid to get more accurate reads. Doing this has also allowed me to realize that there is a really big differential between the liquid above the strip and the liquid below it. Sometimes this difference can be as high as 15-20 degrees. The hot liquid heated by the strip rises and the cold liquid drops to the bottom. Because yeast also drops to the bottom and prefers cooler temps you get more yeast on the bottom and more bacteria on top. \n\nYou\u2019re basically Brewing two different cultures in the same container. \n\nI used to have this set-up until I realized the thing about temp differences. I still use this set-up in the summer when the ambient temps are hot enough that I don\u2019t need a heating pad.

Is that common?", "Does the Jun prefer a lower temperature?", "Hey there, this is such a great setup for just beginning to brew! Looking at your station, the first thing that comes to mind is I would swap out the cotton bar towels with a thinner cotton fabric. I have used cut up pieces of cotton t-shirts and stretched them over the vessel to allow proper oxygen flow. I also find it easier to check on how the smell is progressing with the thinner fabric. The next thing I would suggest is about your kombucha heating setup. For the heating strip that is attached to your kombucha tank, your heating strip looks like it's in excellent position, however, the thermometer attached to the propogate pro that reads the temp of the brew appears not to be connected to the vessel. I would use painters tape to tape the thermometer underneath the stick on thermometer, in between the heating pad (maybe slightly above the spigot) so it is level with where the heat is hitting the brew. Do not put the thermostat attached to the propogate pro into the brew. The acidity of the brew will eat at the plastic. I have found heating pads/strips to sometimes not be true to the actual temp. I use another separate digital thermometer with an alarm system to alert me if the temp of the brew goes above 80 degrees. I tape it right next to the heating pad's thermometer, that way I can calibrate the actual temp of the heating pad, and be alerted if I am in danger of cooking my scoby. It's an extra thing to buy and setup but I find it to help immensely and avoid accidents. Best of luck to you on your booch adventures!", "Set up looks great! I bought the same dispenser from Target and started reading some scary things online about reactivity to metal and plastic. I know the spigot is supposed to be made of stainless steel, but I'm a little nervous about the plastic lining and the quality of the stainless steel. \n\nSince you posted this a year ago, I'm wondering how brewing in those dispensers have been for you.

I've been doing this since 2023, and I just love seeing the improvements I've made along the way. Its also nice just being able to reap the health benefits of a beverage I put my heart, soul, and time into.

{"title": "Why you shouldn\u2019t add sugar directly to boiling tea when brewing Kombucha", "selftext": "If you\u2019re brewing kombucha, you know that tea and sugar are the foundation of the fermentation process. BUT there\u2019s a common mistake that can subtly affect your brew - adding sugar directly to boiling tea. It might seem harmless, after all, sugar dissolves easily in hot liquid. But the temperature matters more than you think.\n\nTable sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide, meaning it\u2019s made of two simpler sugars: glucose and fructose. During kombucha fermentation, the SCOBY naturally breaks sucrose down into these components, which the microbes then consume.\n\nHowever, if you add sugar directly to boiling tea, a premature breakdown can happen. That is, high heat speeds up the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose before the fermentation even begins. While the SCOBY can still use these sugars, faster breakdown of sucrose can lead to quicker acid production, potentially making the kombucha too sour too soon.\n\nWith that being said, the microbes in your SCOBY have evolved to break down sucrose gradually. When that process is altered, it may impact fermentation speed, acidity, and flavor complexity.\n\nInstead of dumping sugar into boiling tea, wait until the temperature drops to around 70\u201380\u00b0C (160\u2013175\u00b0F). This is still hot enough to dissolve the sugar completely but not so hot that it alters its chemical structure. After dissolving, let the mixture cool to room temperature before adding the SCOBY, as high temperatures can kill the beneficial bacteria and yeast.

A few minutes of boiling isn't going to convert an appreciable amount of sucrose into glucose and fructose.

The heat is simply speeding things up (ie anything above room temp, including 70-80C will also cause this process to speed up). I mean yes, there is likely a noticeable difference in the rate of hydrolysis due to the increased temperature from 70 to 100C, but I\u2019m not sure how much that matters, especially compared to the difference in heat from 25 to 70C. \n\nIf the SCOBY is both breaking down sucrose and consuming the fructose and glucose, then heating will just shorten F1.

{"title": "Everything I know about making hard kombucha (long)", "selftext": "I have seen many posts about hard kombucha -- how to make it, how to measure the ABV, etc. I've spent several months collecting information and performing experiments. I hope that I can answer some questions and put to rest some misconceptions.  \nIf you have some questions after reading this or if part of the post isn't clear, please let me know.  \nDisclaimer: Hard kombucha is just a hobby, I'm not a professional brewer in any way.  \n\n## Let's talk about the alcohol already in your kombucha\n\nThere are a lot of questions about how much alcohol is in normal (non-hard) kombucha. Obviously it depends on a lot of things, so I'll be pretty general, and mostly I'm just talking about homemade kombucha.  \n\n1. Popular numbers are 0.5 - 3% ABV.\n    1. https://kombuchabrewers.org/resources/approved-alcohol-testing-methods/\n1. Here is a research paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01188.x\n    1. ABV rises from 0.1% (whatever comes from starter) at day 0 to 0.55% at day 14\n    1. ABV stays roughly constant at 0.55% from day 14 to day 20.\n    1. ABV falls from 0.55% to 0.15% from day 20 - 60.\n1. 3% ABV would be all your sugar turned to alcohol (for the basic recipe)\n    1. This would be nearly impossible in normal homemade kombucha\n    1. The few times I've seen normal kombucha tested it falls between 0.5 - 0.7%\n\n\n## Recipes for Hard Kombucha\nHere's one from Boochcraft: https://boochcraft.com/diy-high-alcohol-kombucha/\nAlso, here's a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iltwiy-SZug  \n\nI have a different approach. I start my hard kombucha from a mixture of finished 1F kombucha and filtered water. Essentially, it's like starting a batch of kombucha with more starter, more sugar, and a special yeast.  \n\nMy recipe (should produce 5-6% ABV):  \n1. Steep 4 black teabags in 4 cups of boiling water for 5 minutes. Remove teabags.\n1. Add 2 cups (400 g) of granulated sugar to the black tea. Stir until dissolved\n1. Cool sugar/tea mixture to 75-85F (24-30C).\n1. Pour tea mixture into gallon jar.\n1. Add 6-7 cups of finished 1F kombucha. Adjust to get desired tartness.\n1. Top off the rest of the gallon with filtered water.\n1. Add 3/4 tspn of yeast (I recommend SafAle S-04). I never rehydrate the yeast.\n1. Stir up the yeast/kombucha a bunch.\n1. Put a lid on container (it should be loose enough that gas can escape it). Use an airlock if you have one.\n1. One day later, open the container and give it a few good stirs. Close it back up again.\n1. Start tasting the kombucha at about day 4, fermentation could take up to 20 days.\n\nWhat to expect:  \n+ A ring of fine bubbles around the top of the fermenting kombucha within two days.\n+ A different fermentation smell (not vinegary, more like fermenting wine).\n+ I usually don't get a pellicle to form. Sometimes you might though. I never use bottles with narrow openings.\n+ ...\n\n### When should you stop the fermentation\n\nThis is up to personal preference. For me, I stop when 70-75% of the sugar that I've added is consumed. I've let a few batches go to 95% of the sugar consumed and it tasted very dry. I didn't enjoy that. So, by trial and error, I discovered that 70-75% is what I enjoy drinking. It usually takes eight or nine days to ferment to that level.  \nIf you ferment too much, you can always add more normal kombucha to dilute it back to something you enjoy. I rarely do a 3F with my hard kombucha (adding flavour from fruit). Instead I will drink the hard kombucha straight, or add a little flavoured kombucha that I have sitting around.  \nFlavour-wise: There might be a strong alcohol taste. Often times this is confused to be a high ABV. The other possibility is fusel alcohols. These are alcohols other than ethanol (e.g. methanol). They can give the kombucha that strong alcohol bite. The good news is that yeast will naturally break those alcohols down eventually into ethanol. If you get these flavours consistently and don't like it. I would either try fermenting longer or switching yeasts.  \n\n## Some helpful hints\n\nIf:  \n+ it seems like it doesn't ferment well\n+ after 14+ days the kombucha still tastes sweet\n+ you don't notice a \"different\" fermentation smell (if you know what wine/beer fermentation smells like, it should be like that)\n\nHere are some things that helped me.  \n\n+ Use more yeast. There aren't too many downsides to using more yeast. It'll speed up the fermentation, and impart a little more yeast flavour (which I don't think is very noticeable).\n+ Keep it warm. Make sure the temperature is over 70F (21C).\n+ Use less kombucha. I noticed that the higher the concentration of kombucha the lower the rate of fermentation. When I used a full container of kombucha (just adding yeast and sugar) fermentation slows to a crawl. I think 25% kombucha is about as low as I'd go though. Otherwise you're just fermenting sugar water which I tried and it was disgusting.  \n+ Use less sugar. At first I was shooting for higher ABVs (10 - 12%) and it wasn't working at all for me. Partially that was because I was still learning the ropes. But also, some yeasts do not like high sugar concentrations. For your first couple batches, aim for 4 - 6% ABV.  \n\n## What yeast to use\nHere are some that I've tried:\n+ Red Star Premier Blanc\n+ Lalvin EC-1118\n+ Lalvin K1-V1116\n+ Lalvin 71B\n+ SafAle S-04\n+ SafCider\n\nI recommend: Lalvin EC-1118, K1-V1116, and SafAle S-04. EC-1118 is very quick and seems robust to different conditions. S-04 is a little slower and I think the taste is a little more mellow. K1-V1116 has been working really well the last few batches, my recent favourite.  \n\nI don't recommend: Lalvin 71B, SafCider. Even though people have had luck with the Red Star Premier Blanc, I haven't. So, I don't use it much.  \n\n\n## Potential ABV of your kombucha\n\nIf you want to alter the recipes that you've seen for hard kombucha to get a specific ABV, here are some ways to calculate the potential ABV from an amount of sugar. Many equations exist, these are the ones I like.  \n\nThe easiest equation to use is:  \n```\nABV% = grams_sugar_per_litre / 16.83  \n```\n_Here is an example using my recipe from earlier in the post:  \n2 cups of sugar = 400 g  \n1 gallon = 3.8 L  \nABV% = (400/3.8) / 16.83 = 6.25%_\nThis equation assumes a very high percentage (95%+) of the sugar will convert to alcohol.  \n\nI prefer a different equation: \n```\nABV% = (0.75 * grams_sugar / 2.0665) / (grams_of_liquid) * 1.26046 * 100  \n```\n0.75 is the estimated yeast attenuation (75% of sugar consumed by the yeast)  \n2.0665 is how many grams of sugar it takes to produce 1 g of alcohol  \n1.26046 is how you convert from alcohol by weight (ABW) to alcohol by volume  \n100 is to turn it into a percent  \n_Using the recipe above as the example again:  \n2 cups of sugar = 400 g  \n1 gallon = 3800 grams of liquid  \nABV% = (0.75 * 400 / 2.0665) / 3800 * 1.26046 * 100 = 4.82%_  \n\nThe amount of alcohol in your hard kombucha will be related to how much sugar you add. For every cup of sugar you add to one gallon of kombucha, you'll add about 2.4-3.1%. So, 1 cup = 2.4%, 2 cups = 4.8%, 3 cups = 7.2%.  \nThe yeast you use will limit how high your ABV can go. For example, Lalvin EC-1118 can go up to 18% ABV (which would require a stunning 7.5 cups of sugar per gallon).  \n\n**Note:**\nYeast attenuation is the amount of sugar (as a percentage) that the yeast will consume. Wine yeasts can often have attenuations above 90%. If you let them ferment until they stop (you stop seeing bubbles rising along the side of your fermentation vessel) you will have a very dry kombucha (like a dry wine).  \nBeer and ale yeast has an attenuation that is between to 65 - 85%. I'm sure some beer/ale yeasts fall outside of that range, but it's a good estimate.  \n\n## Measure the ABV of your kombucha\n\nI have considered 3 ways to measure the alcohol in hard kombucha:\n1. Compare the specific gravity from the start to the finish of fermentation\n    1. This can be done with a hydrometer or refractometer\n    1. Both hydrometer and refractometers have weaknesses\n1. Compare the weight of the kombucha from start to finish of fermentation\n    1. Doing this correctly requires you to account for all weight loss (due to tasting, etc.)\n1. Compare boiling point of finished hard kombucha to boiling point of water\n    1. There is an old but interesting tool for this: ebulliometer\n\nLet's discuss each of these methods:  \n**Note:** During this section I'll mention specific indexes of refraction, densities, etc. Those numbers depend on temperature and concentration. I chose numbers that made sense for kombucha making (where I could find them). Also, there are a variety of equations for these calculations. I chose my favourites.  \n\n### Specific gravity / Hydrometer / Refractometer\n\nThis is the go-to way of measuring alcohol content in beer brewing. Alcohol, water, and sugar solution all have different densities and indexes of refraction. This fact can be used to calculate how much sugar has been consumed and converted to alcohol.  \nUnfortunately, in the case of kombucha there is another important component in the solution--acid. The presence of the acid, and the fact that it is produced by a different process than the alcohol, means that you cannot be as sure of how much alcohol has been produced (or consumed by the bacteria). \nHowever, we can predict what will happen to the refractometer readings when acid is added. The refractometer measures the difference between the index of refraction between water (1.33), sugar water (1.36 for 20% wt/wt solution), and alcohol (1.34 for 10% wt/wt solution). Acetic and gluconic acid both have index of refractions that are higher (1.37 and 1.61) so they will skew the refractometer readings higher than they should be. This will be interpreted as less sugar being consumed and less alcohol present. \nSimilarly, using a hydrometer which measures the density of the water (1.0), sugar water (1.081), and alcohol (0.078). Acetic and gluconic acid both have higher densities (1.049 and 1.240) which skew the hydrometer readings higher. This will cause you to under-estimate the ABV as well.  \n\nI've never used a hydrometer on kombucha. I have used a refractometer on many batches. I took three samples to a local lab to have the ABV analyzed.  \n\nHere are the results:  \n\n|Sample | Refractometer ABV | Lab tested ABV |  \n|:-----:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|  \n|1      | 6.3%              | 7.2%           |  \n|2      | 4.7%              | 5.6%           |  \n|3      | 4.9%              | 6.2%           |  \n\nRMS error: 1.0%  \n**Note:** Notice how the specific gravity ABV estimates are all below that actual ABV. This agrees well with our prediction that it would under-estimate the ABV.\n**Note:** The error depends on fermentation time. Longer fermentation means the refractometer will read an increasingly lower ABV than the actual one. In particular, gluconic acid which is produced later in the fermentation process has a much greater effect on both the refractometer and hydrometer readings.  \n**Note:** The brix reading on the first day or two may actually rise instead of falling. I'm not entirely sure why, I think it has to do with the suspended particles of yeast. It happened on about 50% of my batches.  \n\n#### Equations to calculate ABV from specific gravity\n\nIf you have a refractometer, you must first convert from degrees brix to specific gravity.  \n\n```\nThe first SG is: 1st_SG = (brix / (258.6-((brix / 258.2)*227.1))) + 1\n```\n\nAfter fermentation begins, you need to use a different equation that accounts for the alcohol that is being produced.  \n\n```\nThe final SG is: Final_SG = 1.001843 - 0.002318474 * 1st_SG - 0.000007775 * 1st_SG^2 - 0.000000034 * 1st_SG^3 + 0.00574 * brix + 0.00003344 * brix^2 + 0.000000086 * brix^3\n```\n\nIf you have a hydrometer, or if you've converted your refractometer measurements to specific gravity, you can calculate the ABV with the following equation.  \n```\nABV =(76.08 * (1st_SG - Final_SG) / (1.775 - 1st_SG)) * (Final_SG / 0.794)\n```\n\n**Note:** If you are using a refractometer, the suspended particles/yeast make the refractometer readings harder to see (the line is fuzzy) and it will read a little high. I always refrigerate the kombucha for a day or two to let the yeast settle to the bottom of the container when taking my final refractometer reading.  \n\n\n### Measure weight\n\nThe reason to measure the weight of your kombucha throughout the fermentation process is because most biological processes that consume sugar in kombucha produce CO2. This CO2 is lost to the atmosphere and your kombucha gets lighter. The CO2 loss is related to how much sugar remains in the kombucha and how much alcohol has been produced. You need to be able to measure the weight of the kombucha plus its container with an accuracy around 1 gram. One gram of weight change for a gallon of hard kombucha is 0.03% ABV.    \nThis is not a perfect estimate for the ABV. My equations assume that all sugar is converted to alcohol and nothing else. It will over-estimate the alcohol because it does not account for the glucose that is converted to gluconic acid nor the alcohol that is converted to acetic acid. Because you ferment hard kombucha anaerobically, the alcohol/acetic acid process should slow down (it requires oxygen). The gluconic acid process takes a few days to really get going from what I've read. It's in that paper I linked at the top of this post.  \n\nThis is my main way of tracking my hard kombucha fermentation and what I recommend most people do (if you have a fermentation vessel that you can lift/weigh). Here's how it compared with those same three samples that I had tested:  \n\n|Sample | Weight ABV | Lab tested ABV |  \n|:-----:|:----------:|:--------------:|  \n|1      | 7.3%       | 7.2%           |  \n|2      | 5.7%       | 5.6%           |  \n|3      | 6.6%       | 6.2%           |  \n\nRMS error: 0.2%  \n**Note:** Notice how the estimated ABV is always higher than the actual ABV. That agrees well with our prediction that it would over-estimate ABV. \n\n#### Equations to calculate ABV from weight\n\nFirst, before you ever start fermenting, you need to record the weight of your fermentation vessel including lid (this is your vessel_weight_grams). After you've put together all of the ingredients of your hard kombucha, immediately weigh the total weight of kombucha and vessel (this is your initial_weight).\n\nHere are the equations that should help you calculate the ABV:  \n```\nCO2_lost_grams = initial_weight - current_weight\nalcohol_grams = 1.0455 * CO2_lost_grams\nalcohol_by_weight_percent = alcohol_grams / (current_weight - vessel_weight_grams) * 100\nalcohol_by_volume_percent = 1.26046 * alcohol_by_weight_percent\n```\nSince we noticed that the reading is always a little high, the true ABV is probably about 0.2% below what you calculate.  \n\nAdditionally, if you want to track the amount of sugar that remains in your kombucha.\n```\nsugar_consumed_grams = 2.16048 * CO2_lost_grams\nsugar_remaining_percent = (initial_sugar_grams - sugar_consumed_grams) / initial_sugar_grams * 100\n```\n\nI recommending weighing your hard kombucha most days. It will let you see how the fermentation is progressing. You can stop the fermentation exactly when you want based on your taste preference.  \n\n### Measure boiling point of kombucha\n\nAdding alcohol to water decreases the boiling point of the solution. The process to estimate the ABV is fairly simple. Measure the boiling point of water (it should be near 100 C, but will change based on your altitude and atmospheric pressure in your area). Measure the boiling point of your kombucha. Subtract the boiling point of your kombucha from the boiling point of the water to get a 'delta_temperature'. Calculate the ABV.  \nAgain, I would like to predict what effect the acid will have on this method of estimating ABV. The boiling points of our ingredients are: water (100 C), ethanol (78 C), acetic acid (118 C), and gluconic acid (I can't find a good number other than \"greater than 100 C\"). The acids will again offset the decreasing boiling point due to the alcohol and will cause an under-estimation of ABV. \nOne cool aspect of this method is that you don't need to do any measurements before fermentation.  \n\n\nDemonstration of how this works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM1ST2Yd-XU\n\nIn that video they use a plastic wheel that acts like a slide rule. You can buy them online for $40+. Or use these equations. In the following equations, temperatures are in centigrade.\n\n```\ntemp_delta = water_boiling_temp - kombucha_boiling_temp\nABV = 0.122 + 0.865 * temp_delta + 0.0603 * temp_delta^2\n```\nTo convert fahrenheit to centigrade:\n```\ntemp_centigrade = (temp_fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n```\n\nI attempted several tests to see if I could do this without the ebulliometer. I tried heating water on a stove or in a microwave while using a kitchen thermometer. It was a failure. My ABV results were off by 1 to 2%. If anyone has an ebulliometer and has some data, I would love to see it.  \n\n**Note:** The equation for ABV was created by fitting a polynomial to the table in this document: https://www.umpqua.edu/images/areas-of-study/career-technical/viticulture-enology/downloads/conferences/technical-symposia/2014-dec-wine-chemistry/2014-ts-ethanol.pdf\n\n### Hard kombucha with just kombucha yeast\n\nI wanted to gain some understanding of whether kombucha yeast on its own could make hard kombucha. In this experiment I followed the same recipe that I always use for hard kombucha but I ommitted adding wine/ale yeast. Going into the experiment, I've read that kombucha yeast does not tolerate alcohol levels above 2%. In a variety of long-running academic experiments, I've only seen ABVs in the 0.5-0.7% range.  \n\nThe experiment ran for 21 days with the following results:\n+ 13 grams of CO2 lost (1 quart of liquid)\n+ ABV estimated from weight loss: 2.1%\n+ ABV estimated from refractometer readings: 1.6%\n+ Taste is like very sweet tea. Just a hint of kombucha tang.\n\nThis experiment gives me more confidence that kombucha yeast alone will not produce much alcohol. The refractometer readings are not what I expected. I anticipated that the brix readings would dip slightly and then begin to rise as acetic and gluconic acids are produced. I am unsure what combination of processes could result in little CO2 production and a drop in the index of refraction.  \n\n### My final thoughts\n\nIf you want to try out some hard kombucha. I recommend you start small (make only a quart/litre) and use a kitchen food scale (they are really cheap) to track your fermentation by weight. Make a little spreadsheet to keep track of your progress. If it turns out gross just iterate a few times. Try a different yeast, more or less kombucha, etc. Don't expect it to work every time.  \nMaking hard kombucha has been a super fun experiment for me. I've learned a ton about all the biological processes in kombucha and beer. I've read a lot of academic papers. I've made nearly two dozen batches, varying sugar concentration and type, yeast, kombucha concentration, temperature, fermentation time, etc. The results haven't always been great. Some of it was super tasty and some was just miserable. I've dumped out many batches after just a few tastes.  \nThis post is my attempt to collect the lessons that I've learned over the past few months. It is based on my experiments and my research. Any mistakes I've made are done in good faith. If you notice an error, please point it out to me along with some supporting evidence and I'll update my post. If you have any interesting data about your own kombucha experiments, I'd love to hear about it.  \n\nEdit 1: fixing markdown for tables.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/dpu894/everything_i_know_about_making_hard_kombucha_long/", "created_utc": 1572557112.0, "score": 194, "author": "b7500af1", "num_comments": 63, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/dpu894/everything_i_know_about_making_hard_kombucha_long/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["[deleted]", "I appreciate the post, but this solidified my opinion that hard kombucha is not worth it.

{"title": "The pellicle is not a useless cellulose raft", "selftext": "It seems like there have been quite a few posts where people are telling folks that the SCOBY is the liquid and that the pellicle is just a cellulose byproduct. While it is very true that you can start a batch of kombucha  without a pellicle, it\u2019s not true that it\u2019s just a useless byproduct.\n\nThe SCOBY is the community of bacteria and yeast cells in kombucha. There are bacteria and yeast cells in the liquid. There are also bacteria and yeast cells in the pellicle. Both the liquid and the pellicle contain a SCOBY.\n\nThe pellicle is a biofilm, a matrix built by the bacteria. The bacteria in the liquid is in a planktonic (free-floating) state. The bacteria in the pellicle are in a sessile (adhered to a surface) state. The pellicle also contains significant quantities of yeast, which the bacteria use as a scaffold while building their biofilm. Bacteria build biofilms for many reasons including protection, to access nutrients, and for community benefits including the exchange of DNA.\n\nYes, you can throw away the pellicle after every batch and a new one will form. There are plenty of bacteria and yeast in the liquid to get a batch going. The liquid is enough, by itself, to start a new batch. You are, however, tossing a bunch of bacteria and yeast when you do so.\n\nYou generally can\u2019t start a batch with just the pellicle, which is probably where the idea that it\u2019s useless comes from. There are actually plenty of bacteria and yeast in the pellicle to start a batch of kombucha. The problem is that, without starter liquid to quickly lower the ph of your sweet tea, the brew won\u2019t be acidic enough, fast enough, to prevent the growth of mold and other undesirable microbes that can live in less acidic environments. \n\nTLDR: the pellicle contains lots of bacteria and yeast, just like the liquid. It\u2019s not enough by itself to start a batch of kombucha, but it\u2019s also not a useless inert mass of cellulose.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1gsdi9i/the_pellicle_is_not_a_useless_cellulose_raft/", "created_utc": 1731724635.0, "score": 176, "author": "BedrockPoet", "num_comments": 77, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1gsdi9i/the_pellicle_is_not_a_useless_cellulose_raft/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I have faster F1's when I keep the pellicle between batches.

I haven\u2019t posted in a while but I\u2019ve been around again lately. \n\nYour second to last paragraph is I think the most important, and what I would like to discuss in this comment.\n\nYou contradict yourself: you say there is plenty of bacteria and yeast in the pellicle to start a batch, and then you mention the problem of needing the appropriate amount of starter liquid so that other microbes can\u2019t take over.\n\nTry this: grab a pellicle straight from a brew, and squeeze it. What comes out? Liquid, which contains a SCOBY, which can be used to start kombucha! And this is where all the confusion is! The cellulose itself is NOT a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, but if you pulled it out of an active brew, yes, it contains one. The pellicle holds a SCOBY the same way a bottle of kombucha holds a SCOBY: it\u2019s just a container.\n\nYou absolutely do need an appropriate amount of SCOBY (liquid) to start a batch. And as you already acknowledged, you do not need cellulose to start kombucha.

I always take a significant portion of the class to explain this. I make sure to tell them that we do not call the pellicle the scoby. Scoby is in both pellicle and liquid. I don\u2019t suggest trying to start with only a pellicle, we go over protective PH. I then explain (from 10+years of experience AND experimentation) that with the pellicle added, batches will ferment faster and logically leads to better biodiversity (as you\u2019re not throwing away cellulose-forming bacteria each batch). While you can squeeze the liquid out of the pellicle, it still isn\u2019t as effective as adding it in. \n\nSome people are coming at you like you\u2019re calling the pellicle the scoby, but you\u2019re saying that the pellicle is USEFUL which is true. And as long as you follow like 1-2 rules when transferring it (if you even need to, lots of ways to circumvent this) it won\u2019t lead to contamination, and can actually be positive reinforcement for beginners as they\u2019ll see more positive signs of fermentation. \n\nWe use the pellicle in all our batches.", "I disagree.  While the pellicle does have critters in it, it\u2019s very hard to brew a batch with the pellicle alone.  Mold. Mold, mold.  You have to drop the ph low enough and the pellicle just doesn\u2019t have the ooomph.  The pellicle seals the brew and once it detaches, it\u2019s useless to me except for jerky or face mask (again it does contain beneficial critters).

Instead of all these tips for how to open bottles to somewhat minimize a total mess with a potential bottle bomb, how about we just promote people using the scientific method and record the amount of sugar/juice/sweetener/etc they add to their batches? So if you end up with a geyser even after chilling, you have an idea of how much is too much sugar and too much 2F time for your next batch. Geysers are not successful brews imo, as you stated you lost half of your bottle due to you being unaware that your booch was overly sweet and you didn't give the carbonation a chance to dissolve into the liquid by refrigerating. To me, if you're wasting that much to fizz, it's just as bad if not worse than a flat kombucha. Imagine if you bought a beer or soda and you didn't shake it at all and yet when you open it you lose half the drink to over carbonation, you would not be happy. Dont add more than 5-10% juice or sweetener of the total volume for  your 2F bottles, and as others have stated, chill before opening. Occasionally even with these numbers you'll get a little spillage because different fruits contain varying amounts of sugar in their juice, but when you observe and record your findings your easily able to adjust your variables to get an optimal amount of carbonation. It's funny to me that saying this within this community causes debate. If I were to suggest using good science for better results in any other brewing/fermentation community like r/homebrewing, no one would bat an eye. But as I've learned, apparently good science is too much for some kombucha brewer's to be bothered with.

A purist might disagree on the basis that sourdough feeds on flour while kombucha feeds on sweet tea, but I can attest that starting a starter with flour only is by no means exclusively the best way to get a functional starter and a tasty loaf. I've been a professional baker and doing sourdough for over 20 years, so I feel qualified to judge.\n\n# Preparing the Sourdough Starter:\n\nFirst you must prepare the sourdough starter: Mix about a cup of active, yeasty, bubbly kombucha with about a cup of flour. You are going for thick milkshake consistency. This is called a poolish (POO-LEASH). Leave it covered on the counter - it should get pretty active in a matter of hours. In about 12 hours feed it again with about 2 cups water and 2 cups four.  If your kombucha was lively, after about 8-12 hours this starter should be ready to mix with additional flour, water, and salt into a dough for sourdough bread. It should smell strong of alcohol. If it doesn't, give it a few more feeding cycles.\n\n*As a general rule I keep my starter active by feeding about once every 12 hours. You want to basically double the amount you have, so if you have too much, pour a bunch out before feeding so you aren't wasting too much flour.*\n\n# Mixing the Dough:\n\nMix together:\n\n12oz starter (about 12 hours after last feeding)\n\n1 lb 2oz water\n\n2 lbs 4 oz flour\n\n1 1/2 Tbsp. salt\n\n# Proofing and Baking:\n\nAfter mixing the ingredients, knead the dough on a floured surface for several minutes. Let the dough raise and double, covered. This will likely take 6 hours at least. Divide and shape into loaves (there are many different shapes and techniques). Let the loaves begin to rise, then refrigerate them, covered, 6-12 hours. This is called retarding. It allows the bacterial culture to flourish producing lactic acid. It's not essential, but it's a nice thing to do. Remove the loaves from the fridge and allow them to rise, covered. Your goal is for them to come close to room temp and be fully risen at about the same time. It may take a couple hours. Preheat the oven to 450. There are different methods to get a good crust. For years I used a large baking stone and sprayed the oven for steam. I had mixed success with this approach. A foolproof, easier approach is to bake your loaves in a preheated cast iron dutch oven. (YouTube it). Put your loaf/loaves into the oven, and after 25 minutes turn the temp down to 425. If you're using the dutch oven, remove the lid now. Bake for another 20-30 minutes. Remove when your crust is a nice orangey-brown. When it looks ready, give it a few more minutes - let it get just a shade darker than you would have. Cool. Eat.\n\nYou will eat this bread on its own with nothing on it, but, with butter, or chili, or split pea soup, or cheese, anything, it's wonderful.\n\nu/TheCoolStepDad69 u/TheBurritoMonster u/dadelibby u/KamesJirk u/porkchopunited u/punkisnotded u/3nebs u/AZBeer90", "Please share the recipe, super duper interested", "This might just be the most hipster thing going on at the end of the decade.", "i'll join the echo chamber of HOW??", "How does that even work ?

I\u2019ve never made kombucha but have wanted to for years. Thanks", "That bread looks delicious!\n\nOnce I made water Kefir bread simply by replacing the water in the recipe with water Kefir. I plan on doing the same thing with Kombucha but haven\u2019t got around to it yet.\n\nThe water Kefir bread rose really well. One of the best rises I ever got. The bread was more yeasty and less sour tasting than my standard sourdough but this is probably because I did not develop the flour starter mix over a period of time. I just did an overnight ferment before starting the recipe.", "So, same logic, it should be possible to use a ginger bug for a sourdough starter?", "Hi there!

I tried typing it out but it didn't make much sense.", "cant believe iver never thought of this! thanks for your help this is a life changer! sometimes i just get depressed and cant be bothered to open up my bottles and so they get explosive. so this is perfect", "This is effective, but not nearly as fun", "Somehow I have that exact same bowl.

With a small heater in the cabinet, the bottles stay at about 80F for both parts. \n\nI use 175-200g of white sugar per 1 gallon batch (really more 80% of 1 gallon). I've reduced the sugar to keep things less sweet. Yes, I can proof longer but then it's too acidic for me. \n\nThroughout my experience, carbonation has been low. I think I recall a fruit puree or fresh strawberries causing the most fizz. \n\nI would like more fizz, without more sweetness...AND without being too acidic with the CO2. I should be able to get fizz with e.g. ginger or habaneros and not just berries. \n\n**Is fermenting with some honey a good option to accomplish this?**", "I just put it in the fridge and that solves my explosion problems. Has nice carbonation too!", "If you\u2019re getting this much carbonation, it\u2019s easier to adjust the recipe with less sugar or the timing of bottling and fermenting. Also throw it in the fridge for 24 hours after F2 to allow it to settle and absorb some of the CO2. \n\nThis is helpful in a pinch but you just wasted half the bottle\u2026", "Better to freeze for a little and retry as then it holds in the carbonation", "Why not refrigerate, then open after cooled?\n\nYou wont waste half your bottle.", "Fun fix for when a recipe goes poorly. But seriously guys, just add less sugar and/or F2 for a shorter period. You should never have to clean kombucha off your ceiling because it should never be pressurized enough to explode like that", "Go outside.

I promise I'll start doing savory kombucha recipes soon, but dessert ideas have just been so easy. I recently grew a pellicle using nothing but koji (the second picture), which involves a separate process--the incubation of Aspergillus oryzae on rice. This fungus (also referred to as \"koji\") produces enzymes that break down the complex polysaccharides within the rice. When the enzymes go to work, they essentially turn complex starches into simple sugars. Aspergillus spp. are used to make rice wines (like sak\u00e9), because the resultant simple sugars can be digested by yeasts. So in kombucha, the yeasts are still able to consume these sugars, produce the trickle of alcohol that the SCOBY--or, the acetic acid bacteria in the SCOBY--needs, and keep the system working without additional processed sugar. Rice--like tea--is also rich in tannins and essential nutrients, which allows the pellicle to thrive without tea. The taste is very reminiscent of the fermented rice used to make certain Asian rice puddings, likely because both fermentations involve acetic and lactic acid bacteria. So, I strained the sour rice that was floating in the kombucha (in sak\u00e9 production, this would be referred to as the \"lees\"), added about a quarter cup of the kombucha liquid, a can of coconut milk, coconut oil (to congeal it when chilled), sugar, and spices, and made rice pudding! The final plating was topped with mango, cinnamon, cardamom, and licorice root powder. I'll definitely be making more recipes with this kombucha, as it is an excellent--and stable--alternative to the brightness you usually get with citrus. But, I'm also still deciphering texts about sak\u00e9 in order to get the best tasting kombucha out of homegrown koji. I'll keep everyone (slowly) updated!  \n\n\nEDIT: I initially used some vinegar to lower the pH, and added a piece of pellicle from a different brew. This pellicle grew, and this is now the second batch. I didn't add any processed sugar. Now I add some of the previous batch--along with the pellicle--to nothing but koji and water. I thought it would be confusing if I explained it that way, but I guess it was confusing not explaining the full process.", "This is insane. Love it!

There's actually two kinds here: a white mold that developers dark pins before releasing spores, and a couple patches of green mold (not really on the picture).\n\n\n_____\n\nSo what now? Dump it, scrub the hell out of the vessel with highly concentrated soapy water inside and out, upside and down. Then visually inspect to make sure *nothing* remains on the glass, not even streaks or water spots... then sanitize. Without brewing specific supplies, there's probably only two options to sanitize: heat or bleach.\n\nTo heat the vessel, fill it with hot faucet water (this is to prevent the otherwise cool glass from cooling down the boiling water), then boil enough water to completely fill it. Fill with the boiling water and leave it for at least 10 minutes just to be safe. Or you can bake it, but it's kinda risky with glass.\n\nTo bleach it, well, use bleach. Directions are on the container, I'm sure. Vinegar is not a substitute here, nor is any home remedy sanitizer that some blog recommends. You need bleach. After rinsing, let it dry out overnight to make sure everything has evaporated away. If you don't have bleach and plan to buy some just for sanitizing things, consider getting a sanitizer like StarSan instead. Bleach has other uses, but for sanitizing vessels/equipment it's a hassle and StarSan (or similar) is a much better product for the job. \n\nFinally, clean and sanitize the entire space that it was stored in and the area it was dumped out in (unless you dumped it somewhere that doesn't matter, like outside). Disturbing mold spread spores, you gotta chase down and kill whatever escaped as you dealt with the container. It seems excessive, but it took over a year for the first case of mold to appear and this will help ensure that it takes a whole year for the next.", "[deleted]", "But....

If it has been in storage for a while, fill it with water for 24h so that the spores will wake up (dormant spores are pretty tough). Dry it and 15 mins in 120c would do it. Do not fill it immediately, let it cool first, otherwise it'll break. Also put it on something that doesn't conduct heat, like newspaper, until it has cooled down.\n\nAnother easy way of Sanitizing it is to use dishwasher powder. It is potent stuff, but rinses easily and doesn't leave a taste.", "Nah man that's just you pellicule forming", "Good to know"]}

You'll want to go longer in a colder climate.\n\n2F - transfer kombucha to a second open vessel and drop in a nutmilk bag full of your favourite fruits (thawed from frozen is best as they break down faster). After another few days squeeze the nutmilk bag to get all the juice out from the now mushy fermented fruit.  Give it a quick taste from a spoon and if it's good then proceed to bottling for 3F, otherwise leave it another day.\n\n3F - bottle into something that'll hold carbonation (I use 1.8L growlers) and leave for 3 days (maybe longer if you live somewhere cold) and then refrigerate for at least 24hrs before opening to lock in the carbonation.  I put rubber bands on my caps to make them easier to grip to seal tight/re-open.\n\nI discard most of pellicle off my scoby every couple of weeks after she's about 2~3cm thick, keeping only the thinnest more recent layers."]}

They seemed sturdy and strong enough. I also used a heating mat that is used for growing seeds. It was December so it was cold, that's why I decided to use it for my bottles. They were just standing on the mat. I assume that mat accelerated the fermentation, but I'd have never thought it would lead to explosion. I used various different flavours, but don't think that matters as the explosion caused chain reaction breaking 3 bottles with different flavours so I don't know which one could've caused the issue. But I can say that I eyeballed the sugar that I added because I wanted it to be highly carbonated and sweet (and I paid for it). \n\nSo my question is what do you think could've gone wrong? Was it the quality of bottles (assuming they're weaker than I thought), heating mat or the amount of sugar I used? Or mix of everything? What would you suggest for second fermentation? Is there a limit for how much added sugar can I use? Should I ditch the heating mat (it's usually cold in my house)? \n\nI'll appreciate any help!

Kombucha itself is a SCOBY! And an active SCOBY will always form a pellicle.\n\nTo answer your question, as long as it\u2019s not moldy, it should be fine.\n\nI would ask, how much starter SCOBY (liquid) did you use?

It was once believed to be essential to brewing but we now know that the yeast and bacteria are predominantly in the liquid. The cellulose is optional.

It looks juicy, doesn't appear to have any excessive overgrowth of yeast, and has no visible mold.\n\nBut you should know that pellicles aren't ever alive and cannot die. They can't get sick or anything like that: at worst they can play host to mold, kahm, or fruit fly larvae. (Yours doesn't appear to have any of that going on, either.) This is analogous to mold on a piece of bread: the bread isn't alive, either. \n\nThe living part of kombucha, the SCOBY, is in the liquid; the bacterial part of it is what secretes the bacterial cellulose that eventually becomes a pellicle. In fact, the pellicle isn't even necessary to brew kombucha - the liquid is.

The difference between a booch mother and commercial vinegar is that commercial vinegar is made using a 2 step process so generally will not have any viable yeast or LAB since yeast and LAB sink to the bottom when going dormant. A \u2018dead\u2019 booch pellicle is likely not dead but yeast and LABs are no longer present in viable numbers, but the acetic acid bacteria is probably fine as long as it hasn\u2019t been put in chemicals, heated, left in the sun or left to dry out. \n\nIf it\u2019s \u2018dead\u2019 because you don\u2019t see fermentation, well that\u2019s a yeast problem.

{"title": "Mold + Zero Carbonation in 2nd Fermentation after successful first batch??", "selftext": "Hi! Looking for some advice on what went wrong here...\n\n**My first batch:**\n\nI made a super successful first batch of Kombucha following[ this guide](https://www.youbrewkombucha.com/guide-to-first-fermentation) to the T. I used [this SCOBY + tea starter](https://a.co/d/cbiLEW4). I have [this heat pad](https://a.co/d/8wpdDby) which keeps the 1 gallon glass bottle at around 80 degrees F. First fermentation went for 11 days, second fermentation I added blended raspberry, lemon juice, and ginger (some had jalape\u00f1o as well) and put them in [these bottles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LB1862A?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_10&th=1). Went for about 5 days. They all tasted great, with good carbonation, and no issues.\n\n**My second batch:**\n\nEverything about the setup was the same. I cleaned the bottles with dish soap, water, and bottle brushes -- leaving them open and on a window sill in the sun to dry as I'm on the coast and it's humid here. I wanted to get a more tart and carbonated brew this time around so I made some changes with that in mind. I let the 1st fermentation go for 13 days. Went with the same general recipe for the 2nd fermentation of raspberries, lemon juice, and ginger -- though I added more ginger, more lemon juice, and more jalape\u00f1o. I experimented with a mango + tamarind (kombuchelada attempt) in one bottle.\n\nFive days into 2nd fermentation and there is no carbonation. 6 days in I start to see what I think is mold forming in one of the bottles. I'm 7 days now and there is still no carbonation in the bottles. I've tasted one and it seems okay but not the best tasting/ no carbonation.  \n  \nThe mango tamarind experiment is actually incredibly carbonated and tastes pretty good with no visible mold that I noticed. This leads me to believe it's a problem with the ingredients in the raspberry lemon ginger bottles.\n\nI have another 1st fermentation (from the same SCOBY) going on day 7 now and it all seems healthy with no mold visible. So I really don't think the mold came from the 1st fermentation despite the internet saying that's likely the case.\n\n**My best theories:**  \n\\- not enough sugar because the ratio of ingredients I used decreased the raspberries and the longer 1st fermentation resulted in less sugar as I bottled  \n\\- too cold in 2nd fermentation (mid to high 60s in my house, heat pad isn't used as it's hard to wrap it around 7 bottles)  \n\\- The fruit and/or lemon juice I used was maybe too old and had already started to develop mold I didn't notice  \n\\- Was not sanitary somehow and contaminants were introduced to the \"clean\" bottles -- though this wouldn't explain the lack of carbonation\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mudiq30agnxe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f993c705b03cd0c709a2caf9e62d95d7c563807\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zydfy10agnxe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe2dd0a6e99922b8a5d2a821b001a8ee25387090\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2a2zz0agnxe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e1f971735db797750425074f9c4435d1b271a60", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1ka8623/mold_zero_carbonation_in_2nd_fermentation_after/", "created_utc": 1745878403.0, "score": 1, "author": "HardToBeAHumanBeing", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1ka8623/mold_zero_carbonation_in_2nd_fermentation_after/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Trying to determine if your kombucha may have mold, if your pellicle/SCOBY is healthy, or if something has gone wrong? \n\nCheck out the [pictures and info in this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/pqu7oq/is_it_mold_is_it_normal_whats_growing_in_your/). \n\n**Note:** If other posters have deemed your problem to be `mold!` or `not mold`, please update the post flair accordingly.

Now I have two more batches fermenting, in the second it seems like a SCOBY is forming, the third is unchanged for now, I don't even know if fermentation has started, I'll know in a bit. \n\nIn any case, I have a philosophical question, more or less we all do it with a handkerchief on top so that the kombucha can breathe, however the scoby that forms on top hinders the gas exchange so much that it traps bubbles underneath itself.\n\nHow do you combine these two things?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/2tef6lw9btve1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745077473.0, "score": 1, "author": "jack84botwell", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1k2z7gh/gas_exchange/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["For clarity we like to make the distinction between the SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) and the pellicle / biofilm / cellulose raft.

Some brewers swear by, others toss it in the compost every batch. \n\nFinally the biofilm is not a direct indicator of the health or taste of your kombucha. It is simply a byproduct of the acetic acid bacteria converting ethanol into acid. Case in point, you will have more biofilm growth in the same timeframe if you are using caffeinated tea compared to caffeine-free tea. Nothing more.\n\n\nAlright, other comments: \n\n> The result is a good, very acidic flavor, an almost unpleasant acetic odor.\n\nWe recommend that you sample your kombucha every day to help you track the progress. If your batch tastes too acidic, you fermented it too long or used a *very* strong starter. \n\nYou can soften the acid taste by watering it down, adding sugar / fruit, or adding sweet tea. In the long run, it is easier to stop your primary fermentation before this happens. \n\n> however the scoby that forms on top hinders the gas exchange so much that it traps bubbles underneath itself.\n\nThe gas will get around if it wants to, there is plenty of gas exchange still happening.

Now I\u2019m trying to get back into it, but I keep running into the same problem: my kombucha molds after about a week, every single time I start a new batch.\n\nI\u2019ve been using my old equipment (mostly swing-top jars) that\u2019s been sitting in a storage room for a couple of years. Before each brew, I\u2019ve tried disinfecting everything with boiling water, but it clearly isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve made three attempts now \u2014 twice with SCOBYs from friends and once with a professionally produced SCOBY \u2014 and every time it ends up molding.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think there might be something lingering in the jars that boiling water alone isn\u2019t killing off. Has anyone dealt with this before? Should I look into something stronger, like a chemical sanitizer (maybe sodium percarbonate, oxalic acid, or something similar)? Or do you have any other tried-and-true tips for making sure old brewing gear is truly clean and safe to use again after a long break in storage?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any advice \u2014 I miss my kombucha!\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/1k1gyr5/my_kombucha_keeps_molding_what_am_i_doing_wrong/", "created_utc": 1744907072.0, "score": 5, "author": "Kaka95DK", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/Kombucha/comments/1k1gyr5/my_kombucha_keeps_molding_what_am_i_doing_wrong/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I'd think of the recipe and pH before considering stronger sanitation.

If the pH from the start is above 4.5 ph, automatically bad bacteria and mold can get a foothold and start eating sugar before the kombucha culture is able to lower the pH further. That's how mold starts. \n\nThere will always be mold spores present from the air unless you're working with sterile equipment under a hepa filtered flow hood in a sterile lab. \n\nSo you just gotta make sure there's enough active kombucha microbes present from the start and that your fresh tea pH dropped to 4.5 or lower. Cheap pH strips can help give you a rough idea. \n\nThe best method tho starting with a new culture is just be patient and gradually step it up on volume. \n\nIf you're friend gives you 1 pint of active kombucha liquid for example, only add it to 1 pint of fresh tea. Wait until that ferments, and then add those 2 pints of starter to more fresh tea, maybe only 3 pints or so of fresh tea, so you got like 5 or so pints total now. Let that ferment \n\nNow you gotta fair amount more of very active kombucha culture, and you can add that to more tea than before. \n\nI don't ever go as high as 1 part starter to 9 or 10 parts fresh tea personally, I do about 1:4 ratio when I'm chugging along.", "First things that come to mind are: 1. Too much mix for the amount of starter fluid\u2026 I always err well into the side of too much starter fluid, it\u2019s a little less efficient but much less likely to produce mold. 2.

Wear gloves if you use the PBW. Now that being said, lowering the PH of your starting fluid may actually be more important, as this makes an environment in which unwanted microbes just can't grow. You'd want your ferment to be at least 4.5 when you start it, although I like to get mine closer to 3.5 if I can. A pack of litmus tests for this is under $10 I think. Or, you could just squeeze 1 or 2 lemons into your starter. Those will likely get your PH close to target for up to about a gallon.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, look at your ingredients... organic tea and sugar are best because there are no pesticide residues that can harm the scoby. Also, if your water has a lot of chlorine in it you might consider using carbon filtered (not RO) water for your sweet tea. However, if your tap water only has chlorine, you're probably boiling that off when you make the tea, so that shouldn't be an issue. Some municipalities use something called chloramines, and those don't boil off, so you'd have to carbon filter it if they use those in your area.\n\nGood luck and happy fermenting!", "When all else fails go back to 6:1:1. 6 black tea bags : 1 cup sugar : 1 cup strong starter.

Very interesting question. \n\n\"When light enters a liquid at an angle, it changes direction. This phenomenon is called refraction. Light will refract more when travelling through a liquid with dissolved or suspended solids. Therefore, refraction can be used to measure the concentration of dissolved or suspended solids within a solution. Refractometers are scientific instruments that measure refraction angles and correlate them to an already established refractive index (nD).\nWhat is the Brix Percentage?\n\nDegrees Brix (symbol \u00b0Bx) is the sugar content of an aqueous solution. One degree Brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution and represents the strength of the solution as percentage by mass. If the solution contains dissolved solids other than pure sucrose, then the \u00b0Bx only approximates the dissolved solid content.\"\n\nSource https://www.instrumentchoice.com.au/blogs/news/what-is-a-brix-refractometer-and-how-do-they-work?srsltid=AfmBOoo9Yby91C0naKSLvCb0XQXvml72prQM7jBm-GS63R7e8VdyF0hg\n\nIn other words: Sugar is not the only substance inside kombucha that affects its refractive index. Yeast is probably one of the other \"solluble solids\" that effect the refraction of light, next to sugar. As such a reading on sugar with a refractometer in kombucha is only an estimation. Probably not very reliable.", "I've been struggling with the same problem.  The commercial brand I buy (Aqua ViTea) has a 3 brix, according to my refractometer, but I can't get below a 6 brix with my homebrew.  I believe they use centrifuges to remove solid particles but I can't do that.  I check my blood sugar afterwards (I'm a type 2 diabetic) and don't see a noticeable spike after drinking my homebrew, so I'm comfortable with those numbers.  \n\nI've been following the basic recipe posted on this sub which calls for 70 grams of sugar per liter of water, which is starting roughly with a 6.5 brix.  I then monitor the pH of the F1and cut it off when it starts approaching 3.0.  Below 3 is too acidic for my taste.  This results in a delicious homebrew.  I've been using purple tea lately which is delicious and supposedly very healthy, also.", "Use less sugar. \n\nLess sugar a d when you fully process the sugars to acids the acid level will not be to high to drink.", "If, when the rate of fermentation seems to plateau, it\u2019s still too sweet for your liking, then make a new batch with a reduced amount of sugar. It requires note taking and trial and error to figure out what works for you. \n\nMy generic recipe calls for 1 cup sugar added per gallon of water, which is a starting point of roughly 5g/100ml. What it ferments down to, I\u2019ve never measured. If I were to measure, I\u2019d keep track of how much sugar I\u2019m adding, and then use a hydrometer to track the difference between the OG and FG.\n\nAlso, beer still has sugar. Some styles have little, some styles have quite a lot.", "It's more expensive but will lower total sugar but still sweet. I make jun kombucha with on 3/4 cup per gallon with a brix above 10 before f1. After 10 days you'll half that easily. Mine is always under 5 before bottling", "10mg/100ml is almost nothing at all. You could drink nothing but kombucha all day and still consume less than there is in a cup of cucumber or half an Oreo. Are you sure your refractometer is working right?", "I\u2019m very surprised by the amount of sugar you mentioned. I\u2019m more used to seeing 2 to 5 grams of sugar (not milligrams) per 100 mL, which is considered low \u2014 but it can still be misleading if you consume 1L of the drink.\n\nSo, 5 mg of sugar is virtually nothing. Are you sure you meant 5 mg and not 5 g? Did you read this on a commercial product label?", "Unfortunately, there is no easy way to measure sugar content of kombucha (unless you have lab equipment). Refractometer is totally inaccurate, since alchool and vinegar have same refraction index. You can try with a densimeter, but it will be still not accurate due to the presence of co2 & lots of sediments."]}

I was also a home brewer and have picked up kombucha in the last couple of years. I haven't tried measuring anything other than pH, but even that doesn't tell you much other than an idea of how safe your brew is. I do hops at flame out or shortly after depending on quantity and aa% and what I'm wanting from it. Citra has been super tasty, but pretty bitter as expected. Also depends on how you brew the tea and how long it takes to cool.\n\nAs for consistency, just keep practicing. Have plastic bottles to test for carbonation. Understand the science behind what is happening to help inform your decisions when playing around. For instance, you're asking which teas will work. Nitrogen is needed, which comes from caffeine, so black tea is an easy win. I do the cheapest black tea I can find. \n\nMy scoby/kombucha probably has the ginger bug, it brews much more aggressively than it had in the past. Definitely recommend using ginger!", "1) If you're following a recipe similar to the master recipe (found in the [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/wiki/how_to_start/) guide), you don't \"need\" to add any more sugar. Most people ferment for 1-2 weeks, after this upwards of 80% of the sugar remains. So more is not required ... but not forbidden either. Also the biofilm on top is not a direct indicator of health or taste. It is a byproduct of acetic acid bacteria, it can be stimulated to grow faster/thicker with caffeine but caffeine is not required for kombucha.\n\n1a) Understand that your first batch is usually slower as the culture multiples, so you next batch shouldn't take as long. If you do want to brew faster, it is best to use more starter. \n\n2) Brettanomyces is a natural part of kombucha, so is pediococcus. If brett isn't there ([which happens](https://reddit.com/comments/fererl) ) the pediococcus runs rampant and your kombucha becomes a thick ... sludge. In kombucha, brett is a good thing. \n\n3) You can bottle condition with sugar or juice or puree or any natural really. I've never used xylit. Honestly not sure what that is.\n\n4) Yes, you can search for old posts where people discuss their process and the trial & error that helped them along the way. \n\n5) I've read many things that just aren't true but are regarded as \"facts\". For instance most guides refer to the biofilm as \"the SCOBY\" and tell you it is required. This is not true. Your SCOBY is anywhere the yeast and bacteria are and the biofilm is optional. The liquid is prominently your SCOBY. The biofilm is only a portion of it. And plenty of brewers toss the biofilm each batch. (Plenty keep it too, entirely personal choice.) \n\n5a) I bought a supply of earl gray tea last week. The oil in flavored tea is rumored to kill your SCOBY ... except there are posts about successfully brewing with earl gray for weeks or months. So time to test whether this \"no-no\" is another urban legend myself. \n\n6) You may have read that hydrometers and refractometers are not reliable for kombucha because the density of the liquid changes not only from sugar -> ethanol (like most other fermentations) but also ethanol -> acid ... the density change of acid throws off both of these results. It is annoying. \n\n6a) You may test the pH, some folks regularly do but many just go by taste. I believe the FAQ has a section on \"ideal\" pH levels. If you taste test a small sample everyday (highly recommended!) then you'll be able to track your kombucha's process and stop the F1 before it is too acidic. The aerobic / acidic nature of kombucha is more hands-on in this regard, compared to the sterile environment of anaerobic fermentation for beer, wine, cider, etc. I wouldn't open a bubbling carboy of beer, but I didn't think twice about sampling kombucha."]}

Stick in a spoon or measuring cup (rinsed)\n2. Taste\n3. If I like it, I bottle\n\nSeriously. Your taste buds are amazing measuring instruments that can tell you much more than all those fancy devices. I used to work with those devices daily in a research lab. The reason we use them is to get objective, repeatable measurements that aren't beholden to personal taste, so we can directly compare them to other people's measurements. But if your goal is to make a brew that *you* like, none of that matters. In fact, scientists would be jealous of your incredibly direct evaluation technique. They have to make a lot of assumptions about the environment in which their product will eventually be used, and hope they've correctly modelled the effects of transport, long-term storage, packaging, etc. You don't have to make any assumptions, because you're testing directly in the final environment: your own mouth! Well, almost: the taste experience will be a little different after carbonation and chilling, if you plan on doing that.\n\nDon't worry about disturbing the pellicle. Most of the bacteria doing the fermentation are actually in the liquid. You could take out the pellicle completely and have a perfectly good ferment.\n\nFermentation speed depends heavily on temperature. Where I live (Netherlands), my F1 time varies from 7 days in hot summer weeks to 21+ days in winter with a heating mat. Without the mat, it goes almost entirely dormant, not fermenting at all. Tasting really is the best way to know where it's at.\n\nWhat's the effect of fermenting longer? More of the sugar will be turned into acids, so it'll become less sweet and more sour over time. If it tastes too sweet for your liking, wait. If it's too sour, you've missed your window. Refresh and try again. I like to keep my overly sour brews and use it as a mild vinegar. For long-term storage, I boil it to stop all fermentation (so I'm not making bottle bombs) then bottle it. It's also perfect as a starter fluid.\n\nYou could do a pH test, but the affordable ones aren't super accurate. Your taste buds are better. And again: why bother with second-hand measurements from gizmos? It goes in your mouth in the end, so using your own taste buds to assess readiness is about as perfect an assessment as you can get!\n\nWow, I ended up writing an essay. Anyway, I hope it helps.

You might decide you like to brew longer than 10 days even. I personally don't like it that sour but some folks like a booch with real pucker power. \n\nIf you already like the taste, just drink it until there's only a couple of cups of SCOBY (kombucha) left, and then add fresh sweet tea and wait some more. Alternatively you can bottle it and just start a new batch with the last few cups so you have some finished F1 to drink while you're fermenting more. \n\n\n2. Yes.\n\n\n3. Yes you can, but the batch will taste a little different. The next few batches will still taste a little like it too.\n\n\n4. Yes.

I followed the instructions and brewed my sweet tea, adding the starter liquid and the pellicle. After two weeks, I was expecting some tang, but the tea was still overwhelmingly sweet. I also noticed the pellicle had sunk to the bottom, which seemed odd based on my previous brewing experience.\n\nThen came the concerning part: when I fished out the original Amazon SCOBY, it was really dark in color. It didn't look healthy at all, and frankly, I was worried it had died or something was wrong, so I ended up throwing it away.\n\nThinking the batch might still be salvageable, I took a healthy-looking pellicle layer from another batch that was fermenting perfectly and dropped it into the questionable (still very sweet) tea.\n\nNow, it's been about two weeks since I added the new pellicle. I'm seeing the pellicle floating on top and even forming new layers, which is what I'd expect from a healthy fermentation.\n\nHowever, I'm really worried about the initial two weeks where the original (dark, sunken) SCOBY was in the sweet tea. Could there have been any undesirable bacteria or mold growth that I didn't see? Is this batch still safe to drink or use as starter liquid, even though the new SCOBY seems to be doing its thing?\n\nMy main concerns are:\n\n* **Safety:** Could the initial period with the potentially dead/bad SCOBY have contaminated the batch in a way that's now masked by the new fermentation?\n* **Taste:** Even if safe, will the flavor be off due to the prolonged sweet period?\n* **Starter Liquid:** If the new fermentation progresses, would you trust this batch to be used as starter liquid for future brews?\n\nHas anyone else experienced a dark, sunken SCOBY from an online purchase?

I hope y'all's experience can help me. :) I have a bit of experience with homebrewing beer (and so approach kombucha with that knowledge), but not a lot of total experience in either beer or kombucha.\n\nContext:\n\nThis is my second full batch. Process for my first batch: I got a SCOBY from a friend and brewed a mini batch to get up to \\~4L. Then, for my first full batch, I brewed about 20L total using a ratio of 5g black tea/50g cane sugar/1L water and cooled it to about 95F. I used a sort of partial boil method where I boiled half volume of water, turned off the stove and steeped the tea for a few mins, added sugar, then added the remaining water volume to get to target pitch temp. I pitched the \\~4L of starter + SCOBY. I fermented in a 7gal SSBrewtech brew bucket with a fermwrap and InkBird monitor set to 78F. Fermented for about 3wks, transferred about 20L to a keg, flavored, and enjoyed on tap for a month. :)  I left several liters in the fermenter at room temp so I would have starter for the next batch. Cleaned the fermenter before starting batch 2.\n\nJust did my second batch, similar format. This picture is from about a week in. It seems to be behaving differently than my first batch.\n\n1. My \\~hope\\~ is that the growth on the surface of the liquid is new pellicle, and that things are just going a big slower than I want. Can y'all tell?\n\n2.

You can measure the amount of sugar using a hydrometer (also called a densimeter). It measures the density of your brew, which allows you to calculate the sugar content.\n\nAnother way to measure sugar, and also alcohol, is by tracking weight loss if you're brewing anaerobically while allowing CO\u2082 to escape, as with an airlock. In that case, the weight loss corresponds to the CO\u2082 released during fermentation, which is directly related to the amount of sugar consumed.\n\nYou can estimate the sugar consumed using the following approximation:\n\n1 gram of CO\u2082 released \u2248 0.511 grams of sugar consumed\n\nSince fermentation converts sugar into ethanol and CO\u2082 in roughly equal molar proportions, you can also estimate alcohol production:\n\n1 gram of CO\u2082 released \u2248 0.538 grams of ethanol produced\n\nSo, by weighing your fermenter at the start and throughout fermentation, you can calculate the amount of sugar consumed and the alcohol produced based on total weight loss.\n\nIn summary:\nVessel open: use a hydrometer to measure sugar. Alcohol production is minimal.\nVessel closed: use a hydrometer to measure sugar and alcohol, or weigh the brew to determine how much CO\u2082 has escaped, and calculate sugar consumption and ethanol production from there.\n\nMy methodology: I brew kombucha.

Via via I was able to find a lady who is offering me the SCOBY from the picture. She says there\u2019s 5 pellicles and about 1.5 cup of liquid and she\u2019s had it for about a year and doesn\u2019t use it.

It came from the fridge so I allowed 1 cup of starter tea + 2 pellicles to come to room temp while the sweet tea had time to cool. I rinsed the pellicles with cool water before putting them in. A thin dark brown layer peeled away from the thickest pellicle and revealed a nice light color underneath - it was quite satisfying. I topped the jar off with room temp sweet tea.\n\nOn the right is about 1-1.5 cup of GTs raw kombucha, which I allowed to get to room temp after which I topped it off with room temp sweet tea. I did notice that the original kombucha is a mix of black and green tea and has about 2% kiwi juice. I hope it will be alright still.\n\nAll in all the ratio of starter tea to sweet tea was about 1:3 for both. To make the sweet tea I used 6 cups water, 4 bags of black tea (steeped about 15min) and \u2153 cup (75g) granulated white sugar.\n\nI have some sweet tea and some jars left so I\u2019m considering going on a final unflavored kombucha search to see if I can set up a third batch with that.\n\nI thoroughly cleaned and then sterilized all my jars and equipment using a big baby bottle sterilizer. I also thoroughly cleaned the cabinet they\u2019re in and spritzed the coffee filter and cheese cloth with white distilled vinegar. I really hope this will stop the mold in its tracks. It\u2019s also in a closed cabinet this time, while I had it on an open shelf before.

To get the lowest amount of sugar, don't add anything to your second fermentation. And if it's too sweet for you, then let the 1st fermentation go a day or two or three longer.
