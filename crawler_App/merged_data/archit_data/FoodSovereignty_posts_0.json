Personally I think they approach the question backwards in that in order to feed yourself, you need to start by adopting a local diet, and only then can you start replacing purchased parts of that diet with stuff that you grow yourself.\n\nThe problem the article highlights though is that in some parts of the developed world, very few people grow or can grow enough to live off of because their immediate area lacks production of the staple crops which are the foundation of self sufficiency. Sure you can just start on your own but it's much harder without a community that can offer knowledge, equipment, and support.\n\nWhich brings me to the second thing it highlights, which is the idea that you actually would need to feed yourself on your own. This is an inherently Western idea in my mind that seems to come partly from the complete separation of modern society from food production, making most people clueless in the beginning, partly from the complete lack of true community or experience of it, and partly from the romanticization of homesteading rooted in cowboy movies.\n\nIn comparison, I live in rural Japan where *everybody* grows rice if only out of habit, many of whom grow more than they consume. Then it's just a matter of growing enough vegetables, and what I see around me is that anyone who does so, invariably at a small scale, grows more vegetables than they consume as well, so they sell, trade, and gift some leftovers and preserve the rest.\n\nSo I do know a few people who are almost fully self sufficient, almost as a matter of course, and almost everything one would need to survive is currently available in the immediate area or could be easily produced if necessary (such as salt for example - I have several friends who make salt)."]}

{"title": "Food Security vs. Food Sovereignty", "selftext": "The terms food security and food sovereignty are often used interchangeably. I have always been a bit confused by these concepts so I did a little research and this is what I have found. Feel free to comment and let me know what you think.\n\nThe state of being food secure is when a community has sufficient availability and access to safe, nutritious foods. \u2018Sufficient,\u2019 in this case, refers to foods being able to meet the dietary needs and preferences of a community. Food security does not always specify the types of foods being provided, where these foods are coming from, or level of community involvement. Many food security projects start as disaster relief projects requiring immediate food sources. In emergency situations it is often easier to bring food in from outside sources than source food from devastated local communities. When food imports increase, local producers lose business, while community food security seemingly increases. But as local producers go out of business the community becomes increasingly dependent on imports, which creates a cycle of perpetual dependence on outside markets. This is where food sovereignty differs from food security. \n\nFood sovereignty is a more specific than food security in that it requires a greater level of community involvement. The state of being food sovereign is when the community itself is capable of producing \u201chealthy and culturally appropriate foods that are produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. This includes the community right to define their own food and agriculture system\u201d(Via Campesina 2009)(Alkon and Mares p. 347).  While food sovereign communities may have varying degrees of independence, they all share the common resources needed to regulate their food systems from within.

If you yield control to others it will be eventually used against you. ", "The difference is huge. Security has to do with supply versus demand. This can be easily faked with high volume imports that skew the data on food availability and nutritional value while ignoring the issues associated with importing subsidized grains to agricultural economies. Sovereignty is focused on being self sufficient and meeting to needs of the people domestically so as to eliminate the dependence on foreign export crops and food products. The push to industrialize in the developing world addresses food security from an economic perspective but ignores the more important issues like equity and local development, which undermines grassroots movements towards food Sovereignty and reduces the ability of a society to provide for itself in the long run. Food security is based on a unilateral metric of economic strength and import capacity that ignores social justice and equity. ", "The concept I worked with on our Food Security City Council is based on the FAO international definition but we expand it towards deeper community preferences. We found a midpoint between food security and sovereignty to work wand gave us [good results](http://www.alternativascc.org/toolkit/building-urban-food-policybest-practices-lessons-learned-la-paz-bolivia)"]}

While there I began to focus on African politics and specifically the issues of food security, agriculture, and climate change. It was in one of my classes on \"global hunger and food\" that I first came across the term food sovereignty as opposed to food security. At that time it was in the context of Via Campesina (didn't they invent the term?). I didn't pay much attention then, but filed it away as pretty interested.\n\nFast forward to getting out of school and I became directly interested in tbe manual side of growing food crops and started pursuing that. Being out in the \"real world\" and experiencing how harsh our system can be to poor people, I got politically radicalized and became an anarchist. It immediately dawned on me how well radical left politics and permaculture/agroecology/food sovereignty interlink. It was at that point that I joined this sub. I was really happy to see that it exists. \n\nFood sovereignty to me basically just means democratizing food - food by and for the people - the end of corporate food, and tbe beginning of self-reliant and sustainable food. I really think that changing the way we produce and share our food will be the bedrock for the social transformation that we desperately need to avert some of the looming threats posed by industrial capitalism, from mass plague, to psychological alienation, to climate change, to mass extinction events, and so on. It's a topic of huge interest to me. Glad to be here!"]}

{"title": "Food Sovereignty in Puerto Rico", "selftext": "Food Sovereignty advocates for the right of communities to determine how and where they want their food to be produced and processed. It is an international, grassroots movement led by peasant farmers who are educating citizens and challenging companies and governments for change. One of the most prominent groups championing food sovereignty is La V\u00eda Campesina, and since their founding in 1989, many local organizations around the world have joined under their umbrella. One of these organizations is Organizaci\u00f3n Boricu\u00e1 de Agricultura Agroecologica (Boricu\u00e1). Boricu\u00e1 is a group in Puerto Rico that has been promoting agroecological practices on the island for over 30 years. They noticed that local knowledge about agriculture was being lost to industrial food production, and initiated a campaign to re-establish traditional knowledge. Since then, many different farms have joined their network. \n\nA bulk of Boricu\u00e1\u2019s work consists of solidarity brigades, wherein farmers go out to other farms and help establish projects, upkeep, or just provide a helping hand. They also do education and promotion of agroecological practices.\n\nIn 2017, hurricanes Irma and Mar\u00eda collectively destroyed over 80% of Puerto Rico\u2019s agriculture. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, Boricu\u00e1\u2019s farms ensured that their respective communities had food, because their mixed agriculture systems ensured that some of the crop was saved. However, as hurricane recovery shifted into the long terms, and damaged farms struggled to recover, it was other organizations not affiliated with Boricu\u00e1 that took the mantle in organizing relief work. El departamento de la Food, for example, which was a restaurant/ vegetable supplier, set a goal to carry out 200 solidarity brigades over two years. They were able to mobilize people on a level that Boricu\u00e1 never could. \n\nGiven this, some interesting questions arise. Was the effectivity of El Departamento de la Comida solidarity brigades brought on by the hurricane itself, or would they have been able to rally folks regardless? Does the fact that they\u2019re not associated directly with Boricu\u00e1 have sociopolitical implications for their work? Alternatively, can their work be called Food Sovereignty even if it is not explicitly stated as so? In situations like this, how do we value intention versus outcome?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "created_utc": 1557172671.0, "score": 9, "author": "Correct_Customer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

We believe inspiring children, teaching them and letting them delight in eating fresh snacks from the garden are keys to unlock doors of future potentials. Children are the hope for better tomorrow's and if they learn young and enjoy growing food, we feel honored to be a part of that. \n\n\nMost recently we were an integral part of getting an EBT machine for our farmers market and grant money for a new pilot project supported by the FDA where families on EBT can get double their produce for half the cost up to a certain amount. \n\n\nI hope you enjoy the pics.

They are cultured to fast food, Doritos, beer, soda and like that kind of food and have no interest in paying for Bibb lettuce or mr stripes tomatoes.  Their palate is tuned to iceberg lettuce and green picked tomatoes slices on the Whopper.  I have seen the Pottstown farm market struggle for years while the Chinese and pizza joints thrive.

Required to promote food production, manufacturing A to Z , commodities speculation, futures, wholesales to the middlemen, retail sales to the consumers so that healthy economy and the profits of the corporations, multinationals on a world wide scale reflect positive numbers.\n\nThe higher these numbers, the better is the world economic state of affairs, success other factors that induce happiness, health, wealth, prosperity and posterity for the continuation.\n\nAs long as these expectations are met, it matters not how each nation and the world at large gets there and in doing , what may be the ramifications. That is precisely what classify as viable, economically sustainable prosperous and supposedly healthy, tranquil world with establishment of laws, justice, insurance of domestic and international tranquility, that may provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty and posterity. At least that is what states in our US Constitution and this nation to regulate commerce within, among several states and with foreign countries..\n\nWhat is intended has never worked and neither is their any mention of equal justice for all, domestic tranquility for all, promotion of general welfare of all and security of liberty and posterity of all. More so that the above equability has never existed.\n\nTo that end we and the world has always gone separate ways to achieve high standards we proclaim for economic prosperity and posterity.\n\nIt has taken us over 100 years to reach this point of chaos & will require 100 to reverse dogmatic trend of waste /abuse.\n\nEdits:\ntldr: Capitalism creates waste by necessity. Giving away food is in contrast with the values of capitalism, thereby either eroding values or eroding our economy (I'd rather change our economy). \n\nPersonal comment: Umm, it will take way longer than 100 years to repair the damage we have done. \n"]}

Primarily, we work on providing technical and informational solutions to problems facing the agricultural community in developing countries. We do this both with an online platform (which I\u2019ve linked to above) and a premium SMS platform which mimics most of the functionality of the site (putting people in contact with buyers, help people check prices, etc).\n\nIn one of our previous [posts](http://www.agroam.org/blog/when-data-isnt-enough-keeping-agriculturalists-informed-via-the-new-traditional/), we discussed how we can provide certain data well, but have issues with other types, where complicated ideas need to be brought forward.\n\nWe thought about some solutions to this, and generally what farmers are looking for in developing countries and we realized a wiki might be useful. We get decent traffic from developing countries and have several large scale projects lined up to bring in even more. Most questions we come across are along the lines of \u201cI grow Y but I am thinking about growing X - does anyone have experience growing X?\u201d\n\nWe think a low level agricultural wiki explaining the basics of how to grow various crops would be a large benefit to the people that stop by our portal. Basic information, such as how to plant, the growth cycle, how to manage the item, what pests to watch out for, etc. We understand that most farming is highly contextual based on various climatic and economic conditions, but even very broad amount of information could help spur some growth.\n\nIf there are people willing to help, we just deployed [our wiki software](http://www.agroam.org/agro_wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) (not linked to on our main site).\n\nI will be answering any questions about this for the next 5 hours.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnthony\n\n**tl;dr \u2013 We run a website for farmers in developing countries and think having basic farming information would help cover a lot of gaps in local knowledge.

The notion of hybridity has been used to help conceptualize the \u201cblurring between conventional and alternative food supply systems\u201d (Ilbery & Maye, 2005), since the \u201cbinary opposites\u201d of so-called conventional and alternative food activities \u201care not as simple and clear-cut\u201d as much discourse generated by actors in alternative agrifood movements might indicate. The interconnections arising from both alternative and conventional food activities between and within wild, rural, suburban, and urban areas have a wide range of effects across communities in developed and developing nations. Scholars increasingly turn their attention to examining, measuring, and understanding these effects.\n\nThe cultural and political ecology of human-environment relations comes to life through the subject of food. Critical questions concerning the burgeoning alternative (or hybrid) food economy may encompass the following: Who is included and who is excluded in new alternative or hybrid activities? What actors are attracted and involved in these activities? How durable are new approaches to food production, provisioning, and distribution? What cultures or traditions are being created, attenuated, revived, and/or strengthened through alternative or hybrid agrifood practices and activities? What is the role of the state and/or supranational regulatory bodies in these activities?\n\nThese sessions invite an array of methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of food and food systems at a variety of scales. Accordingly, they will examine interconnections between various actors, places, institutions, and networks related to food production, processing, distribution, preparation, retailing and marketing, and consumption, and their social, cultural, political, and environmental outcomes.\n\nTopics might include alternative agrifood movements and institutions; shortened agrifood-supply chains; food security and sovereignty; local, regional, and global food systems; defensive localism; food availability and accessibility; food and inequality; food trade; food and public health; foodsheds; state policy; supranational and private regulatory bodies; food aid; globalization; food and development; subsistence; food identities and cultures; feminism and food; decommodification of food; alternative distribution systems; farm-to-institution; community-supported agriculture; marketing local foods; food safety and quality; traditional foods; the role of industry and retailers; farmers markets; school food; community gardens; squatters\u2019 gardens; and more.\n\nInstructions: If you are interested in participating in these sessions please register for the 2012 meeting and submit an abstract.  Send your abstract and your Program Identification Number (PIN) to either Gina Thornburg (gkt@ksu.edu) or Rachelle Beveridge (rbeverid@uvic.ca) by Sunday, September 18.\n\nSorry if this is not what you are looking for in r/foodsovereignty.

Like drinking a dew drop with it in it.\n\n2. they are disorienting for bees. Bees who come in contact with neonicotinoids have trouble finding home. They get lost. And some end up dying from exposure.\n\n3. they are addicting. This is the biggest killer. Bees will continue to visit nectar and pollen sources where neonicotinoids have been sprayed, even if there are better sources of food.\n\nThe third one is huge. All the research talks about the first one... yet disorientations and addiction are by far bigger killers."]}

(i.e. CNN)\n\nWhere i live at least, stuff like McDonalds is *far* more expensive than grabbing some kale, andive, brocolli, potatoes, rice, eggs, red cabbage, and other raw ingredients, and cooking them. Dont supermarkets offer them? (meat is more expensive, but you dont need it)\n\nIf they don't, well here too, what supermarkets offer can be a tad limited, especially for cheaper ones. I think they have trouble pushing perishables through without some of it .. perishing.. Turkish or other foreign shops often have more variety/different things, though. Its more of a matter of \"boredom with cooking the same thing\" than lack of vitamins/minerals.\n\nQuite frankly, i expect quite a bit of obesity is about behavior.\n\nAnyway, even if food availability is good, i do like the idea of food-co-ops.", "Your local quicky-mart located in the classic urban food desert, will stock whatever sells, that simple. If there was a demand for X and they can make money selling it you can bet it would be on the shelf.\n\nThe reality is that if you emptied one out and stocked it with dry legumes, fresh produce counter and brought a grass fed cow in every morning to give milk straight from the teat even at a reasonable price, more often than not, it's not going to turn over before the produce goes bad and cow goes dry. \n\nAs big a problem as access, is education and demand from the customer, actually the former is caused by the latter. Much of the country (speaking US here) has forgotten how to really cook, from scratch, in the first place. Until that changes, nobody is going to stock perishables to supply a demand that does not exist, that's economic suicide for a business.\n\nYou need to create the demand and the supply will follow."]}

All the signals are there such as working automated vehicle prototypes, upcoming battery giga-factories, affordable array of depth and environmental sensors, portable miniature computing platforms, heavy graphene research, and an initial release of programmable small business robotics such as Baxter. Google's acquisition of the most innovative bipedal robotics companies is going to spur on many competitors once they release the initial version of their robotics platform in a few years.\n\n\nAgriculture is an interesting area in regards to automation because it's already being implemented at the top levels. Already farms are using more and more technology such as drones, self-driving equipment, and automated task-based robots such as dairy farm milking machines. I think this area will be huge once we see truly affordable robotic components hit the market. Currently projects such as FarmBot are appearing which are the early beginnings of a much larger movement in the future. I really hope we can get to a point where automated vertical farming with aquaponics is possible so we can free up land while increasing our food production, lowering costs, and reducing environmental impact.\n\n\nFarmBot\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CJt4MFn22M\n\n\nMilk Automation\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0ywHnjcQFQ\n\n\nVertical Farming\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFQOkzEjxQ\n\n\nAquaponics\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26xpMCXP9bw\n\n\nInsect Farming\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwC4WRKi5QY\n\n\nLab Grown Meat\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rJwZkOzWsQ\n\n", "My rough guesstimate: Automation will be deployed in society in basically the same manner as all other technologies. Large businesses will produce the vast majority of output with it, but everyone else will certainly be free to use it as well. \n\nIn other words, automated farming won't change our social structure. It's another piece of technology-- another tool in our arsenal. The basic format of human societies isn't changed by the introduction of new tools. The way our society runs (the manner in which it does what it has always done) is the only thing that changes because of technology. ", "At least initially, introduction of more-or-less universal robots into agriculture would make the \"economy of scale\" (i.e. big farms, big fields - so one tractor/worker can process large amounts of land / product to be commercially viable) of large farms less of a competitive advantage.\n\nFor example, if you have a universal robot that can seed potatos, water them (now you can grow potatoes in the desert!), weed them (no need for pesticides), cultivate soil and then extract them from soil -- viola -- you can provide for your family from an acre of land with next to 0 physical effort on your end. \n\nToday I would never even consider growing my own food, but with robots doing 90% of the job -- why not? And that thing charges itself in the sun during the day and can work at night time...\n\nEventually though the big players on the market will be able to consolidate the means of production in the hands of the few and may be even outlaw the local production of food and/or highly tax robot owners. Similar to how today few cable companies removed all competition via incremental legislation today. "]}

Food Sovereignty in Canada explores how communities all over the country are actively engaged in implementing alternative agricul\u00adtural and food models within the framework of food sovereignty \u2014 taking control over food-producing resources, markets and agricultural policy. This framework offers Canadian citizens, researchers and policymakers the opportunity to build alternative agricultural and food models that are less environmentally damaging and that keep farmers on the land while ensuring that those living in cities have access to healthy and safe food.
