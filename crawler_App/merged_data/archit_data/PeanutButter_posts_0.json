Each scoop is a declaration of self-love, a reminder that joy can be found in the simplest of pleasures.\n\nLet us not be swayed by the naysayers who deem it inappropriate. Instead, let us stand united, spoon in hand, declaring that we deserve this moment of indulgence. We are not just eaters; we are connoisseurs of flavor, and peanut butter is our muse.\n\nSo, I urge you: let us reclaim our right to enjoy peanut butter with a spoon, to savor every bite without shame.

They took an interest in helping us grow and were challenging us to come up with ways to increase our sales. We were presenting different ideas when they shared this feedback: \"Lee, you keep telling us that adults eat Peanut Butter & Co more than kids, and that you are making a higher quality product with certifications that appeal to adults, but the cartoon monkey on the label makes this look like a kids brand. That's something I think you should seriously consider changing.\"\n\nWe did a tremendous amount of research on our customers and found that the number one way they eat our peanut butter is with a spoon. At the time, no other brand featured a spoonful of peanut butter as the hero image on their label (now several do).  We tested different versions of the label with and without the monkey with new and existing customers and most preferred the version without the monkey, so we decided to give the monkey (his name is Bananas) a vacation, and give our products a new look and feel.  For the most part, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nWe miss Bananas too. We always planned to bring him back in some way, shape, or form in the future., but Covid everything that came after happened, and we've had to focus on other things.\n\nThank you all for the interest in our brand and the feedback!

I don't want to be rude or too pedantic, but in the hope that I can help people learn, I'd like to share what I know.\n\nMy background is purely as a home cook and food enthusiast. But I did work for Hershey's main warehouse for their third party logistics partner. I've gotten to know Hershey brands very very well.\n\nIf you notice on the label, it says \"Chocolatey\" which is industry lingo for something that cannot legally be called \"chocolate\". I couldn't say for sure if that \"lava\" filling could legally be considered ganache either. But it's certainly not \"milk\" chocolate.\n\nWithout getting into boring details, it's probably a less intense flavor because chocolate itself is very expensive compared to the oils and sugars they can use to engineer something that tastes good.\n\nAnd finally, Hershey, along with other American chocolate producers has a very distinct, acidic flavor from the milk chocolate process that they use. If you ask people from other parts of the world, they often think it tastes like vomit. No lie.\n\nBut more importantly to this topic, Hershey \"Special Dark\" and other \"Dark\" products are also not legally considered \"Dark Chocolate\". You'll see on their packaging that they are very deliberately not calling anything \"Dark Chocolate\". I suspect their special dark and other dark products use a similar recipe to their milk chocolate, and to me, it tastes terrible. I love real dark chocolate, it tastes nothing like what Hershey's makes."]}

Place on cookie sheet and press each ball twice with a dinner fork to form a criss-cross design.\n\nBake for 10 - 13 minutes, or until the edges become a light golden color. Do not overbake, as these are supposed to be soft and chewy. Let the cookies rest for at least 5 minutes before moving to cooling rack.\n\n**My notes:** I skipped the sugar coating this time, as it's an annoying (and IMO, unnecessary) extra step. As you can see, I also used chocolate chips and peanut butter chips in place of the roasted salted peanuts.\u00a0\n\nI also used salted butter, instead of using unsalted and then adding extra salt to the recipe. I'm not sure why anyone would bother doing it that way, unless they just happen to already have unsalted butter in their house.\n\nYou can also make the cookies smaller, if you wish. I made both big and small ones out of this dough. Just keep an eye on the smaller ones, as the bake time may be a wee bit shorter.\n\nEdit: I forgot, I also threw some leftover Reese's Pieces in there too.

The peanut butter formula gives children a nutritional buffer that helps them survive illnesses like malaria, which are a part of life for children in Africa.\n\nBecause of Dr Manary\u2019s work, this therapy is now standard care world-wide and has since been endorsed as the best way to treat severe malnutrition by the World Health Organization, United Nations and UNICEF.", "I use peanut butter when I'm really struggling to eat.", "I think I first heard about this food under the name [Plumpy\u2019nut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumpy'nut?wprov=sfti1#Use).  \n\nIt was patented, but the patents have since expired. \n\nThe basic idea is to mix milk powder into peanut butter. \n\nAs anti-milk people have pointed out, the purpose of cow\u2019s milk is to make the baby gain a thousand pounds.

{"title": "Ohio Peanut Butter Buckeyes (revised recipe)", "selftext": "So, the traditional recipe of like 3-cups of confectioners sugar, 1-cup PB, stick of butter was just cloyingly sweet even if dipped in super dark chocolate. Only problem is that the sugar is structural. Add too little and they stay mushy/gloopy even when chilled. So I needed to up the PB flavor and diminish the sweetness while giving it structure. \n\nNew recipe uses the shelf stable hydrogenated (yes, hydrogenated, just don\u2019t eat these every week) veg oil in PB chips. It\u2019s super stable at room temp and adds some sweetness and more PB. \n\nSo this recipe uses a bag of Reese\u2019s PB chips, 2 cups of PB, 1/2 cup dehydrated PB powder (in the US \u201cPB2\u201d), and 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  Gently melt PB.  Like just barely liquidy. Add the PB chips. Stir to melt the chips and also to bring down the temp of the PB. Add the PB powder and sugar. Mix.\n\nFor crispy mouth feel, feuilletine is great but too hard to make. So I substituted good quality store bought ice cream cones (traditional kind, like Dutch waffle cones) lightly broken up. Added all that to KitchenAid to mix. Scooped out with spring loaded scooper. Chilled in fridge. \n\nI used the cheat method for tempering the chocolate.  Guittard extra dark chocolate chips. Nuke on 20 second cycles until just starting to melt. Rest. Stir. Do NOT over heat. Just barely melted. Around 100\u00b0f/38\u00b0c.  \n\nSeparately, finely FINELY chop (almost shaved) a 100g bar of 85% bittersweet (Lindt) chocolate. Once the chocolate is just melted, add the shaved dark chocolate. It\u2019ll recrystalize the cocoa butter to give it that snap.  \n\nDip. Tray. Fridge. Eat.

So when I realized that [CB\u2019s Nuts](https://www.cbsnuts.com/) in Washington (known for their many peanut farms) had a dark roast that was pledging only one ingredient, I did not hesitate. I do not hesitate to share my findings.\n\n\n\n**IN THE JAR**: This hulking glass jar is very modest, its huge white peanut label kind of disguises the insides. I could tell it was dark and roasted deeply despite its attempts to hide from me. When I opened it up, I was surprised to see no oil on top (ed note: this is becoming a frequent occurrence and I am on board for not stirring for 2 hours).\n\n\n\n**ON THE SPOON:** Oh dark roast, hello, you are so wonderfully intense. This is some *thick* peanut butter. I am pretty sure when \u201cthey\u201d came up with the statement \u201cstick to the roof of your mouth\u201d it was actually CB himself. If you like the bottom of the natural jar that you forgot to stir, this entire jar is for you.\n\n\n\n**ON THE BREAD:** My difficulty with extra *thick* peanut butter is that it just obliterates the bread when you try to spread it out. So I got real lazy and just pretty much piled it on there. This is a really nice dark roast, it only has peanuts so I think it could use just a tiny bit of salt, but somehow the non-salt does not bother me. The thickness is really nice once you can get it spread out a little.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is a really nice dark roast, a little too thick for me which is why I am knocking it down a spoon to 4/5 spoons. If I lived in Kingston, WA, I would probably live at CB\u2019s Tasting Room ([what?](https://www.cbsnuts.com/retail-shop-copy))", "[All my silly rankings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQsX8nknr2Bj4shwiFFoWckJ-ek86VGFMHsr9mCPnVZpWq7P3J1j4cRDWKO91Z0Vh0eji66GM1B5_iq/pubhtml)", "I love to see it", "That looks phenomenal.

Honestly, I groaned and said \"Oh no\" out loud. I don't care for dark roast/toast anything.

It\u2019s rare that someone decides to take the caviar of the peanut world and smash it up. Enter Koeze? From Michigan?   \n\n\n  \n**IN THE JAR** well now this is the weirdest shape I have seen for a jar. A little oil separation at the top, but not a lot of oil in there. Opening it up, the tiny mouth actually makes it easier to stir without the dreaded oil spraying all over the counter issue that I assume I only have.   \n\n\n  \n**ON THE SPOON** I can really taste the distinct flavor of the Virginia Peanuts, but this is a darker roast than it appears to be. There is something dark about this that does not appear to be. Perfect amount of salt. This is a thick thick peanut butter.   \n\n\n  \n**ON THE BREAD** if you like to spread it on thick, this is for you, and for me. It is not so dry that it rips apart the bread (hate) but is also not a liquid that can sometimes happen with natural peanut butter. On the sandwich I get less of the darkness I tasted from the spoon test.   \n\n\n  \nOverall though, this is a highly enjoyable, dark roast hiding in light roast\u2019s clothing.

It is definitely on the thick side, my kids are bothered by how messy every other brand is whenever we travel and Koeze isn't available.\n\nThe major downside of this stuff is that because it's so thick, it's incredibly difficult to mix, BUT if you store the jars upside-down before opening them, the job is much easier, as you don't have to fight the dense oil-free part at the bottom of the jar."]}

{"title": "Justin's PB - Review", "selftext": "As a fellow peanut butter lover occasionally I'll try out a brand that is outside of the norm of the Skippy, Jif, Peter Pan. Sometimes they're good, sometimes I just don't get the point. \n\nI actually got this as a gift... someone who knows I love peanut butter! It appears to be a bit of a higher end brand as it's priced above the staples. \n\nFirst things first... it's runny. \n\nOK, I've had experience with peanut butter that doesn't use hydrogenated oils. That's fine. It needs a little stir. It's supposed to be \"better\", right? It says non-GMO. Pollinator friendly. That must ensure that they're really trying here...\n\nWell, it tastes like... well, nothing. It's a little gritty. A little peanutty. But really, it feels oily. Mostly without flavor. That's because I found that the typical added salt, sugar and occasional molasses have been omitted. OK, it must strive to be a healthier, bougie brand. The kind people pick up at Whole Foods holding a $7 coffee. I can fuck with that, maybe. Sure...\n\nSo with the omitted ingredients, you're left with peanuts and... wtf? Palm oil. One of the trashiest oils on the market. A low rent, environmentally unsustainable product that, really, I've only found with any regularity in Dollar Store food. \n\nSo we've ditched ALL the flavor and used an oil that is used as the primary component of biodiesel fuel. But that's not all. \n\nWith all of this strange formulation, at least the peanut content has got to be top tier... right? No. This clearly CANNOT be marketed as peanut butter due to the slightly smaller \"spread\" underneath the words \"peanut butter\". It can't be peanut butter if it's less than 90% peanuts. It's just a \"spread\". Justin's is not even true peanut butter and it doesn't come with the bonus of being \"honey roasted\". \n\nSo, not only does it have a reduced peanut content over commercial brands, it costs a bit more. Not only did it eliminate salt and sugar, but it effectively increased the crappy palm oil level to the point that it not only took over the place of those 2 other ingredients but it went FURTHER with it and disqualified this from even being a comparable product to budget-level Peter Pan. This has likely more oil than any PB on the market and it's not better for it. \n\nI don't understand the reason for this formulation. Maybe it's good for diabetics? Idk, is this keto friendly? But it's not delicious. And it's not peanut butter. It's a flavorless oily mess. \n\nGrade: D+.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hn81n9", "created_utc": 1735277863.0, "score": 109, "author": "alkie90210", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/PeanutButter/comments/1hn81n9/justins_pb_review/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["R u on the toilet in this pic", ">This clearly CANNOT be marketed as peanut butter due to the slightly smaller \"spread\" underneath the words \"peanut butter\".

According to FDA regulations, for peanut butter to be labeled as peanut butter, it has to contain at least 90% peanuts. The only other allowable ingredients are salt, sweeteners and hydrogenated vegetable oils. Fully hydrogenated oil does not contain trans fat and all major brands of peanut butter in the U.S. contain zero grams of trans fat per serving.  Natural peanut butters that include peanuts as the only ingredient also meet the criteria and can be labeled as peanut butter.\n\n>**Products that include anything else, like palm oil** (which is higher in saturated fat but is not-hydrogenated and is trans fat free) or flavors or other ingredients **must be labeled as peanut butter spreads. They may still contain at least 90 percent peanuts and have a similar nutritional profile, but they\u2019re outside the standard definition of \u201cpeanut butter.\u201d**\n\nhttps://www.mashed.com/1175834/heres-the-difference-between-peanut-butter-and-peanut-butter-spread/\n\n>As the National Peanut Board explains, peanut butter is made via a very straightforward grinding process. It's typically made up of at least 90% peanuts, with extra ingredients including basic items like salt, sugar, and oil.\n\n>The difference between peanut butter and a peanut butter spread all comes down to the ingredients. The Florida Times-Union explains that oil is one ingredient that separates the peanut butters from the peanut butter spreads.\n\n>Food scientist Bill Skinny told the publication that **peanut butter must be made with hydrogenated oil.

I drained 24 grams of oil that accumulated on the top of the second jar of peanut butter sitting in the pantry.  I stirred the remaining contents and refrigerated the jar.

When I'd get the one with the paper label it was off when I'd get the one with the glossy label it was fine. Fast forward a few months later I got a glossy one and flavor was off too. So I emailed Skippy aka now Hormel Foods and they told me that the, formula hasn't been changed and to give them the lot code on top of jar and that they'll look into it. So far I haven't heard anything back, so I solved the mystery. The top of the jar has an exp date and a lot code and manufacture time.\u00a0 To get the good Skippy the jar must have those numbers engraved on it and not stamped on it with white or black ink. It seems to me that Hormel Foods has various manufacturing facilities in the US. And some of the facilities don't produce the real good formula. Also the good Skippy is a lighter reddish brown and the bad one is a more dull darker brown and on the bottom of the jar, the good one has little dabs of oil bubbles in certain areas, the bad one is more bland without any of those oil bubbles. The bad Skippy is as bad as generic store brand peanut butter. The problem is that it could be months before the good Skippy shows up and if those batches end then the, shitty ones appear soon after. I hope this helps. When Skippy is the good batch the super chunk one nothing can touch it nothing.

{"title": "PBCC Bar Update", "selftext": "Hi guys I posted in here a couple weeks ago about PBCC bar i would buy from a bakery and asked for recipe suggestions. Ive baked maybe 6 since then and the results have been really good! So i will share what I\u2019ve learned.\n\n\nThe recipe for the PB I tried with pb/condensed milk and using tube cookie dough from the store-the ratios with condensed milk:PB was bad, not nearly PB enough. Then i tried 1.5 cup PB, 1.5 cup powdered sugar, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract. IT IS VERY GOOD. It smells like butterfinger and after 4 more times i started thinking this is like the form of PB you want to use for confections. Hence, its often called confectioners sugar that makes perfect sense. \n\n\nSo i experimented with some homemade dough recipes and its pretty great. It goes how you would expect, spread dough in bottom, spread PB mix on top, but then instead of a full dough layer to seal it, \u201ccrumble\u201d the cookie dough onto the topNo different recipe than your usual fav chocolate chip cookie dough but maybe half, or thirnd, or even less chocolate chips. but if you want me to post mine I can.\n\n\nIn my last bake, I had some remaining dough and PB mixture, and just rolled them together into a couple cookies and it was just as good as the bar, possibly even better. Tonight I tried ripping off another bakery\u2019s delicious good, a chocolate cookie with PB filling. They are just out of the oven and dont look all that right, but probably will taste awesome too. It is the chocolate cookie recipe from the back of the reeses chips package that i kind of expect everyone here to be familiar with, flattened, drop in the same PB mix from above, and seal then roll into a ball.\n\n\nI was extremely impressed with this sub, i kept scrolling and telling my wife that after 20 years online, ive finally found my community.

Palm oil production is a problem for the environment (and the people involved iirc). The other ingredient you didn't address that's generally in these peanut butters is sugar. LOTS of sugar.

The one good reason they're largely banned from bringing pb to school)", "The stir type just tastes a lot better to me. It's worth the effort.

I don't like the consistency, and how it melts when it's out of the fridge as I'm eating it. \n\nI grew up in a blue collar family on store brands and budget foods, like we ate margarine. I didn't have butter on a regular basis until I moved out on my own. Trans fats used to be the major health concerns with hydrogenated oils, they weren't banned until I was an adult. Now hydrogenated oils in my country are somehow made without producing trans fats, which were a byproduct of the hydrogenation process. The issue with palm that I know of, is it's often unethically sourced, like chocolate. It's sourced from regions where workers and the environment are exploited. Still, it's in so many foods! It's hard to avoid when you do not have the resources to buy everything from a specialty grocery store. \n\nI am not against palm oil, but I am against exploiting workers and the environment. Saturated fat is not my biggest concern, since I do not have heart disease, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure. Of course, I'd wish everyone got check ups by the doctors on a regular basis.

I think natural tastes better, but stirring is annoying, and also, I like to keep my energy intake consistent, and with natural, the peanut butter at the top of the jar is much more calories than at the bottom.\n\nThe fully hydrogenated oil in Jif is probably relatively healthy, since it should be mainly stearic acid, like in cocoa butter. Palm oil is controversial - it takes valuable tropical land to grow those trees. But those trees can produce a lot of oil and you're using such a small amount in peanut butter.", "Hydrogenated oil, yes I avoid at all costs.\nPalm oil, no but have been inclined to get natural more often as of late.\n\nI do like the taste of different types whether natural or not", "If the second ingredient is sugar or oil it\u2019s basically poison.", "I honestly don\u2019t care.

Even just seeing jars of it at the store sometimes makes me shudder because I see all that oil on top and just. Ew. Really nasty to look at. I like thick but soft, smooth, lightly sweetened (just enough to notice it) and slightly salty PB. Thick like a DQ Blizzard, able to be held upside down without moving even slightly.

I only keep one jar stocked at a time, and typically will go through it within 1-2 weeks with 3 weeks being the longest.\n\nI was in my former apartment when this first started, and had been storing the jars in an overhead cupboard which was beside the microwave. I eventually stopped storing them there and moved them to a cupboard not next to appliances. In my new apartment, I just had jar go bad today that I've only had for 1 week. Currently I've been storing them on top of the fridge as this apartment has very limited storage and the only open area would be right besidge a microwave again.\n\nAny ideas what's going on here? Am I just getting very unlucky with some bad jars?

The label is also camo, which is also wild. It had minimal oil but boy did that dill slap me in the face when I opened it up. Stirred up really easily. \n\n\nON THE SPOON: I thought the spoon might be as far as this peanut butter went. But I surprised myself when I actually enjoyed the flavor. The peanuts are nicely roasted which you taste first and then there\u2019s a hit of the dill pickle. I went ahead with trepidation to the bread.\n\n\nON THE SANDWICH: it\u2019s a lot, and maybe more of a once in a while thing for me. I like the added flavor from the dill but the texture is a great balance of thick and spreadable which is what\u2019s keeping me interested. It\u2019s definitely on the saltier side but that seems right, maximizing the salt? \n\n\nAnyway, this gets its own 4/5 pickles.

Even water is toxic in a high enough dose. Here are some pb concerns that I didn't bother to look up because there's a more thorough looking response already but at a glance I think it might be at least partly AI generated:\n\nThere's definitely the calorie issue. You can easily overdo it from a dietary perspective. Pb is pretty calorie dense which is great if you're trying to meet a calorie need cheaply and easily but not so good if you're trying to watch your weight.\n\nI think I've heard/read that it can cause kidney stones and/or gallstones if you eat way too much, but not sure if that's for anyone or just if you have a pre-existing health issue of some kind. Could also be untrue.\n\nI think too much fat and too much protein can both cause problems, so maybe those are the kidney and gallbladder issues? Maybe something else, I don't know. But I'm sure you could overdue fat and protein by eating too much pb.\n\nPersonally, as much as I love it I might risk getting sick of it, and that would be devastating.", "To a number of posters in this specific Reddit, the answer is an absolute no.

While peanut butter is a good source of protein, healthy fats, and nutrients, excessive consumption can lead to:\n\t1.\tHigh-Calorie Intake & Weight Gain \u2013 PB is calorie-dense, so eating too much can lead to an excessive caloric surplus.\n\t2.\tDigestive Issues \u2013 The high-fat content can cause bloating, diarrhea, or discomfort, especially if consumed in very large quantities.\n\t3.\tExcess Sodium & Sugar \u2013 Many commercial PBs contain added salt and sugar, which can contribute to high blood pressure and other metabolic issues.\n\t4.\tAflatoxin Exposure \u2013 Peanuts can contain aflatoxins (produced by molds), which, in extreme amounts over time, have been linked to liver damage.\n\t5.\tNutrient Imbalance \u2013 Over-reliance on PB may lead to an unbalanced diet, lacking in other essential nutrients.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no exact \u201ctoxic\u201d amount, moderation (around 1\u20132 tablespoons per serving) is key. If you\u2019re eating multiple jars a day, you might want to reassess!", "1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of peanut butter has 38 mg of oxalates.\n\nTo reduce the risk of oxalate kidney stones:\n\nKidney doctors (nephrologists) advise getting 1,000 to 1,200 mg of calcium every day (from food or calcium citrate pills) so the calcium binds with the oxalates in food.\n\nThey also say every day one should drink more water (10 to 14 cups is the current recommended amount), consume less sodium (under 2,300 mg), consume less, and consume normal (not excessive) amounts of protein.\n\nFor some patients they advise staying below 200 mg of oxalates from food every day after doing medical tests.

It was specifically the gallbladder area and got so bad I went to see a doctor and he said I might have to get the gallbladder removed.  Thankfully the MRI didn't show any gall stones or any reason to remove it.  But after that I learned my lesson.  Just my experience so not scientific in any way, but there is definitely a limit before your body will break from too much PB.", "Well that depends I've heard of people going into anaphylaxis just looking at peanut butter.

The kernels for runner peanuts are mostly uniform in size, which makes them perfect for evenly roasting so that your peanut butter has a consistent taste in every jar.\n\nValencia\n\nHaving three or more kernels per shell, the Valencia has a sweet flavor and is commonly used for all-natural peanut butter. Also, they are excellent for use as boiled peanuts. Valencia peanuts account for less than one percent of U.S. production.\n\nVirginia\n\nConsidered the \u201cgourmet\u201d peanut type, Virginia peanuts have large kernels and are the type you get in the shell at ballpark stadiums. Because of their large size and premium characteristics, this type is best suited for snacking instead of in peanut butter.  Peanuts that end up as in-shell peanuts are the biggest and prettiest out there. They not only have to pass grade for size, they have to pass for color. \n\nSpanish\n\nA smaller type of peanut compared to others, Spanish peanuts are known for their red skins and nutty flavor profile. They have a slightly higher oil content, which adds to their flavor when roasted.  Spanish peanuts are typically used in candy, confections, and peanut butter, and most of the organic peanuts produced in the U.S. are of the Spanish type.", "I use Spanish redskins for my home made peanut butter.
