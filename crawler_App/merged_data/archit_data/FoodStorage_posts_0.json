{"title": "vacuum sealing freeze dried food - why do some foods seem unsealed after a few days?", "selftext": "Hey all: have a question regarding storing home freeze dried food in vacuum sealer bags for medium term storage. I remove food from the dryer while ensuring there is no moisture remaining in the food (cold spots, etc), put it into a typical vacuum sealer bag you might buy in 100 packs from Amazon, clamp it into my sealer and press the button. The vacuum pump engages, the dried food gets a little crushed due to the vacuum created, all air is sucked out and the sealer engages. The now sealed food is in an air-tight bag where the plastic clings to the food and nothing can move around. Why then, in some cases can I come back a few weeks later to my dry, cool basement pantry to find the bags of food still sealed, but seemingly not in the air-tight condition I left them? E.G. you can pick up the bag and shake it and the food within moves around, but when you squeeze the bag, there are no air pockets to be found? This tends to happen more with powdery food such as raw eggs, but I've even had it happen to whole freeze dried green beans. Is there somehow more air in the void space between the food that the vacuum sealer doesn't get out on initial sealing or am I dealing with minute impurities in the seals of my bags?

AAA can help recommend and resolve any questions, issues and concerns the customer may have. \n\n5. There may be other questions and concerns that a customer or vendor will need that we can assist with. \n\nExisting Freezers/Coolers\n\nFreezers and Coolers do have a lifespan of approx. 25 years. After years the insulation will start to fail, and your R-value will decrease and cost money. Your refrigeration equipment will need to work harder to keep the temp inside your freezer/cooler. \n\nThe seams of the panels may become compromised and allow air penetration that will cause moisture and water issues. (We all want to prevent the presence of mold that will happen if not addressed.)  Also, ice around the outside and inside of the box may happen that will cause safety issues for slips and falls. We all want to minimize injuries that can be costly.\n\nThere are options and solutions for the customer that will save money and down time that AAA can offer. \n\nDoors, hardware, walls may have been damaged by vendors, employees and others while loading the freezers and coolers.  This will happen and should be expected due to human error. \n\nFeel free to call if you have any questions about how AAA Cold Storage Consultants can assist with your cold storage needs.\n\nAAA Cold Storage Consultants\n\n585-576-6127", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodStorage/comments/172ckvq/aaa_cold_storage_consultants/", "created_utc": 1696701678.0, "score": 1, "author": "Due-Professional1049", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodStorage/comments/172ckvq/aaa_cold_storage_consultants/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
