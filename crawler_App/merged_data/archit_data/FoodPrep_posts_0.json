This is run on donations from the community in a community of about a thousand. The \u201cmeals\u201d must be shelf stable and require no more cooking than a microwave and that\u2019s to be avoided if possible. We\u2019re talking feeding 3 each breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack items to 40ish homeless or impoverished kids from 3-15 years of age for three days each. To the point of the post, I have access to a state approved kitchen and to a source of farm fresh meat and a usda butcher.
