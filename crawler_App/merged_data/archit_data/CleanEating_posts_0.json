{"title": "Just started clean eating, question about weight loss", "selftext": "I have struggled with my weight all my life. I realized the problem won\u2019t be solved by losing all the weight with a diet, and then going back to my bad habits. So I decided to make a lifestyle change and eat clean from now on. I am 2 weeks in and feel pretty good.\n\nIdeally, I am doing this because it\u2019s what my body needs. Aesthetics put aside, my health will improve by not eating processed foods. But I can\u2019t help but succumb to my obsession with thoughts about my weight, so my question for those who have been eating clean:\n\nWhat is your experience with eating clean alone (no added exercise yet) and weight loss? They say weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise so I\u2019m curious if eating clean alone has helped you trim down. Was it significant? Or barely noticeable?\n\nI do plan on incorporating exercise in my lifestyle, but I\u2019m trying to make changes bit by bit so they\u2019re more likely to stick. I\u2019m focusing on eating clean first.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanEating/comments/jn2bsk/just_started_clean_eating_question_about_weight/", "created_utc": 1604371590.0, "score": 18, "author": "girl_ineedhelp", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/CleanEating/comments/jn2bsk/just_started_clean_eating_question_about_weight/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Firstly Congrats on wanting to better your lifestyle and achieve a more active and healthier life. From my own experience, and god I have tried many different diets/ways of eating in order to figure out what my body needs. I came back to clean eating for the way it makes me feel also, however this time I chose to keep my carbs on the lower end of the spectrum, incorporating OMAD here and there, which has significantly sped up my progress. I agree as like many would - 80% diet and 20% exercise. It is hard to begin with holding onto your mass and trying to work out, so cut yourself some slack and just walk or cycle to break a sweat and be content with that at the beginning. You will notice with eating clean - (when I say clean - I chose to eliminate all packaged foods, except of course where I couldn\u2019t control going out for meals at restaurants and pubs) weight loss might seem slow to begin with. But no word of a lie - it just gets faster and faster as you go along and you may even reach a point where you will have to up your intake in order to maintain. That was/is the case at least with me, however everyone is different.\n\nLook - at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about what you want and need to maintain your lifestyle, mental health and physical health. You may not get it right the first time, but keep researching, asking questions, but ultimately- listen to your body. You\u2019d be surprised how much it can and will tell you as you go along. Good luck with your new way of life!!", "I eat clean, I always have. I actually consider myself quite lucky to have been raised eating Whole Foods. With that being said I also count macros (carbs, fats and protein) to be sure my body is getting the \u201cbest\u201d fuel/energy. Depending on gender, height, current weight, current activity level and goals the fuel you need will be different from the fuel I need. You could eat a 100% clean diet and NOT loose weight because you are over fueling your body or not fueling it correctly. Nuts and dried fruit are a fantastic snack but eating a 1 lb of cashews and a bag of raisins won\u2019t help you reach your goals. And the same goes for junk food. You could \u201cdiet\u201d and eat low fat, sugar free processed foods without much nutrition and loose weight but your body isn\u2019t being adequately fueled so it will plateau and stall, besides feeling completely deprived and like a total failure (did that a few times when I was younger, totally SUCKED). \nBy properly fueling your body you will be SHOCKED at how much food your body needs and by fueling it with clean foods that are full of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) you get sustained nutrition. I\u2019m never hungry and I have so much more energy. And it feels really good to eat food that you know is 100% good for you. \nAs far as exercise goes, like you said. 80% food and 20% exercise to loose weight, but to have sustained health, exercise is an absolute MUST. To change your the composition of your body (the shape and size) exercise is a MUST. I also 100% believe that beyond just the physical, exercise offers mental and emotional benefits as well. Strength training/weight lifting for women (for men too!) is an amazing confidence and self esteem booster along with all the other health benefits of bone density, balance, and injury prevention. Find something you love to do. I love to workout (can you tell) but I didn\u2019t always. I love it for so many reasons but mostly because it\u2019s MINE! I own it. And I\u2019m not some crazy CrossFit person out rolling tires in my driveway at 5am. Im a middle aged mom. I spin, jog(only if it\u2019s warm), lift and I incorporated a daily yoga practice during quarantine.", "I also focused on eating clean and will add exercise later.  I think I was about a week or so in when I knew I would keep eating clean even if I never lost weight because the health benefits for me kicked in pretty quickly.\n\nDue to my own issues with ED in the past, I've deliberately chosen to focus on health and not weight loss.  It will be 23 weeks of clean eating for me this Thursday and in my effort to change my focus with a new approach I didn't weigh myself at the start and haven't since.  \n\nCounting either lbs or calories gets me into a weird headspace where it becomes an internal competition to lose faster which for me leads to unhealthy thoughts and behaviors.  \n\nI am down 2-3 sizes in jeans (depending on the brand.)  I had to retire a couple of pairs of pants I can no longer wear to work as they are too big, and I'm wearing things I haven't been able to get into for a while.\n\nIt's definitely been significant for me, and other people have definitely noticed a change; people who didn't know about my clean eating because I never discuss food, weight, or any personal stuff with them have asked me what new diet I'm on because they've noticed my weight loss.\n\nNot gonna lie - nice to have confirmation that the weight loss is noticeable but I really, really am not a fan of commenting on each other's bodies at work so I just say I switched to clean eating and change the subject.\n\nI had a plan to focus first on clean eating for a few weeks, then portion control, then exercise.   But a collateral benefit of clean eating is well before the end of my first week portion control was a non-issue.  Once my diet was 100% clean I was fully satisfied with smaller portions.  So much of processed food has such little nutritional value that our bodies are always craving nutrients.  \n\nFwiw my issues were never binging and I generally ate moderate portions (just of crap food), so Idk how portion control resolves in people with those struggles.  \n\nIn the past 22+ weeks I had one cheat when I deliberately chose to have a small piece of cake on my son's birthday.  I had 3 bites and lost interest.  I worried for weeks if it would cause me to fall off track, or if it would reignite cravings but really I was both happy and sad that I have no interest even in the occasional oreo ice cream cake.  \n\nI also was pleasantly surprised in how my palette has changed.  Before this I couldn't imagine eating fish without some kind of sauce and now salmon filet with just a touch of salt and lemon is one of my go-tos a few times a week.  And those few bites of cake were way too sweet for me now.  \n\nSorry - didn't mean to write a thesis.  Your post resonated with me because I could have written it not long ago.  Congrats on making the change - it does become second nature after a while.", "Just eating better is not enough. You need to have a high calorie deficit every day if you're not gonna exercise. And after losing weight, you need to move to have a regular lifestyle of clean eating to keep it up.\n\nWhen I was at my thinnest, I was exercising very little and I was only eating clean, about 1500-1600 calories every day (I'm 158cm).\n\nNow I exercise a lot (HIIT 3x week, dancing class 1x week, biking whenever covid allows it). I eat mostly clean, but probably more close to 2k/day now. I weight about 10 kilos more, but I look pretty good. Most of  the weight is muscle and it's looks pretty good. I don't know what I prefer, but regulating food is easiest when you are single, working out is easier when you have a partner. IMO, that is.", "This is definitely doable! Exercise is an add on of course is great for your health, and it would make your process a bit faster but it\u2019s doable! \n\nOnce your gut and body start getting used to to cleaner foods you will start having more energy and exercise might come on it\u2019s own :) \n\nCheck this out lots of tips on this https://www.instagram.com/askfercci/guide/weight-loss-made-easy/17870486135195037/"]}

I consider myself very fortunate to be introduced to fruits, vegs, seeds, etc at a young age- even though I was raised on mostly unhealthy stuff.

And others just are content with eating processed garbage. \n\nI'm also fortunate in the fact I never liked chips or cheetos or really anything crunchy due to my teeth problems from my medical condition. I liked pretzels and goldfish, but I swallowed it without chewing.\n\nIt's just so satisfying to snack on raisins or sunflower seeds or fruit. It feels good.

The most important intrinsic motivation to take with you along the journey is \"I want to actually feel good and healthy\". Hold that close to your heart and mind.\n\nBasic principles of food and eating would look like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(1) The food you eat is energy and information\n\n(2) Focus on \\*what\\* you eat AND \\*how\\* you eat it\n\n(3) Eat for the \\*unique you\\* and your unique life\n\n(4) Eat food as close to nature as possible\n\n(5) Hydrate\n\n(6) \\*Respect\\* the food and \\*respect\\* your body\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBegin by looking through everything you have in your pantry and fridge, and everything you eat from take away and when dining out, and ask yourself \"how did this get here?\". Then, after you eat a meal, \"how did this make me feel?\" The first question ties in with principles (1) and (4),  and the second question to principle (2) and (3). \n\nRemember that you are an entirely natural organism and even though it may sound obvious, everything in you runs on energy. The quality of the energy (food) you fuel you body with, will determine how your body and mind functions, and therefore, how you feel. When you put something inside of you that has been processed with man-made additives, chemicals, and the like, you are inherently giving your mind and body the information that something \"unnatural\" is being used for energy. This confuses your brain and digestive system. It makes it work harder for less fuel, and usually, the fuel it obtains from the food, is of a lower quality and out of sync with your natural organism. So principles (1) and (4) say, start to look at the food as energy and information, and do your best to eat food that is entirely unprocessed, as close to being from the ground where it grew as possible without human manipulation. \n\nThen, as you start eating, you want to come to know the inherent qualities of individual foods and curated meals. This is when you begin to pay attention to the food, and then, the process of eating. And the simplest way to do just that, is to eat slowly, with your entire focus being on the taste, smell, texture of the food, as well as how your stomach responds to it. You will begin to notice that some foods, even though they are recommended by food blogs and nutritionists the world over, just don't jive with you. While others, at specific times of the time, make you feel truly wonderful. Your mind and body know best. By paying attention to what you put inside of you, and then how you eat it, you will start a positive feedback loop of learning more about the energy you give yourself and your unique self.\n\nAnd, remember to hydrate frequently throughout the day on high quality water (purified water is the best when buying water from stores, as it is as close to nature as possible).", "Fiber Fueled is a book about resetting your diet for gut health. It has a 4 week meal plan to ease you into it and all that jazz. I think they are releasing a full cookbook this year.", "For me, routine is everything. I fall off but I know how to get back on.

I have issues with swallowing and so need my food to be quite wet, but store bought sauces are just full to the brim with additives and flavourings, I also didn't want every sauce that I had to be full of oil either. So that was a challenge.\n\nI'd say for me the biggest thing that helped was start small and build. Rome wasn't built in a day. Start off with focusing on one meal, like breakfast for example and build up a few meal ideas that you can have for that. It will be quite boring at the start, as you will probably find yourself repeating the same meals over and over, but you can expand on that over time.\n\nI'm also coeliac so have to be completely gluten free which added an extra challenge, but again using the method above of finding say 10 ingredients that I knew were safe and clean and basically mixing and matching them gave me a really good foundation that I could build from.\n\nComing into the world of AI is also a major help. I did a lot of this before there was so much information.

Treating myself as I would a friend, and becoming my own therapist/friend/parent that I had always wanted. That in itself did wonders for my outlook, because over time, the better I became at it, the less I brought myself back down. \n\nI'm not perfect by any means. Soda is a massive challenge for me that I am still trying to overcome, but generally my diet is so much better than it was a year ago and I am seeing the results in my energy levels and my general outlook on life. I am someone who firmly believes that progress is better than perfection. Last year was focusing more on my mental health whereas this year I am shifting that to physical health.

Get in the habit of reading ingredients lists on labels and look up which ingredients to avoid - you don\u2019t want to straight up avoid everything you can\u2019t pronounce because some of them are just the scientific name of something natural. I do curbside pickup so that way I can sit at home and check out the ingredients instead of standing in the aisles forever. And it\u2019s okay (and generally cheaper) to buy frozen veggies and smoothie fruits, they\u2019re usually just flash frozen without preservatives. It\u2019s super easy to just toss some veggies in oil and seasoning and bake in the oven. \n\nCouple of things I\u2019ve decided to fudge on: bread - I hate whole wheat, I half mine with bread flour instead of just wheat flour. Still better that way than buying bread. Sauces - I do not have time to make 2-3 sauces every week, so I just buy them. It\u2019s a tiny amount of my diet. If you\u2019re just wanting to be healthier, I\u2019d say what\u2019s important is just changing your overall eating style. What I mean by that is as long as you\u2019re cutting out 90% of processed sugars, drinking plenty of water, and putting mostly raw, unprocessed foods into your diet like fresh veggies and cuts of meat, you\u2019ll do alright. \n\nHere\u2019s my general day: \n\nBreakfast: 3 eggs scrambled with homemade greens powder, diced bell pepper, onion, and jalape\u00f1o, homemade hot sauce, and a slice of homemade honey wheat toast with butter \n\nLunch: plain Greek yogurt with local honey, chia seeds, cinnamon, and pepitas. A banana or other fruit, Crunchmaster multi-seed crackers with cheddar cheese, great value omega-3 trail mix. And maybe a pickled veggie or tortilla chips and homemade salsa. \n\nDinner: I mean, there\u2019s tons of recipes, I just make sure there\u2019s a protein and a veggie, sometimes with brown rice. One of my favorites is pork chops, onion, bell pepper, potatoes, and beets with olive oil, salt, and pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder baked at 400F for 7 minutes per half inch (thickness) of a pork chop. \n\nhttps://greenhealthycooking.com/clean-eating-meal-plan/\n\nhttps://www.eatingwell.com/article/288643/14-day-clean-eating-meal-plan-1200-calories/\n\nhttps://homemadeforelle.com/clean-eating-meal-plan-week-2 \n\nhttps://www.100daysofrealfood.com/recipe-honey-whole-wheat-sandwich-bread-for-bread-machine/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.popsugar.com/fitness/Honey-Ginger-Lemon-Popcorn-44208623/amp\n\nhttps://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248510/lemon-tahini-dressing/\n\nhttps://www.kristadabel.com/clean-korean-beef-bowl/\n\nhttps://breaddad.com/bread-machine-honey-wheat-bread/\n\nhttps://www.loveandlemons.com/air-fryer-french-fries/\n\nhttps://www.kristadabel.com/clean-korean-beef-bowl/\n\nhttps://www.budgetbytes.com/black-bean-roasted-salsa-soup/\n\nhttps://www.mastercook.com/app/Recipe/WebRecipeDetails?recipeId=21363270\n\nAnd my favorite bread: https://everydayannie.com/2008/07/24/american-sandwich-bread/ Instead of all-purpose flour, I do 1.75 cups wheat flour and 1.75 cups bread flour. That doesn\u2019t add up to what the recipe says for flour because when substituting wheat flour for white, you do 7/8 cup wheat for every cup of white there was supposed to be. I also do bread machine yeast instead of instant since I use the machine instead of doing it by hand because who has time for that? \n\nI\u2019ve got a lot more information and recipes, this just seems like a good stopping point, probably far past a good stopping point.", "Have you considered Noom? -I\u2019m not endorsed in any way- but it has worked for me.

I\u2019ve been on this journey for years and am still learning, but here are some of my tips. \n\nA meat thermometer is your best friend. It\u2019s also not a sin to eat over cooked meat, just won\u2019t taste as great. Cooking ground beef to 160 degrees kills any E. coli that may be present. Chicken is probably the one you need to watch out the most for. It should never be undercooked. \n\nYou can eat out and eat clean. Avoid chain restaurants, they\u2019re the most processed. Also try to avoid places that are heavy on frying things. They might have one or 2 cleaner things on the menu but will most likely still be high in fat. Avoid dressings and dips, they most likely contain inflammatory oils, high sugar, high sodium, etc. \n\nSome swaps that may be possible while eating out but definitely at home to get you towards cleaner eating: \n\n- syrup for maple syrup\n- sugar for coconut sugar, monk fruit sweetener, honey, or maple syrup\n- bacon for turkey bacon\n- sausage for chicken sausage\n-  white breads for whole wheat, sourdough, multigrain\n- choose chicken & fish over beef and pork\n- avoid corn syrup (it\u2019s in a lot, start checking ingredients)\n- Vegetable oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil etc. is also bad. It\u2019s hard to avoid but there are some brands out there that use avocado oil (which you can also cook with) & extra virgin olive oil (which you can you use for adding after cooking & for dressings) \n- choose organic whenever possible \n- low sugar/ no sugar\n- low salt/ no salt\n- avoid filler ingredients in boxed items like corn \n\nIt\u2019s going to take time for your body to adjust, especially with sugar. I no longer crave anything sweet, (this took a few months, but can take as little as 2 weeks) and even just thinking about something as simple as a Starbucks drink makes me cringe. \n\nThere is way to much to cover here but google is a great place to start. Just type in stuff like \u201chow to eat clean.\u201d And you\u2019ll soon go down never ending rabbit holes :)", "I agree with the other comments. Start slow and make shifts to better, less processed food. Read the ingredients. Do you know what they are, then eat it. If you can pronounce it, don\u2019t. Stick to food that came from the earth whenever possible and not from a factory. Cook at home so you can ensure that everything is cooked and handled properly. Cut out red meat and processed meat. Swap soda for water or fruit enhanced water. I also like Poppi. Research \u201cclean\u201d brands like Primal Kitchen or Lesser Evil. Clean out your pantry and fridge of the worst of the worst. It takes time! I started my clean eating journey in April of 2023 and it\u2019s still a work in progress but it gets easier the more you do it.", "Not direct advice but something that has personally helped me \u2014 listening to health science/nutrition podcasts and interviews of people like Chris Van Tulluken and Tim Specter.

I've learned so much about food and how what we eat affects our bodies and our health, and hearing it explained by all these experts (especially Chris and Tim in regards to processed foods) seriously changed the way I think about food. I've been transitioning to clean eating for the past month or so now, cooking more at home and always reading food labels.

The best trick that I used to switch over to clean eating was don\u2019t try to change your diet completely all at once and do a lot of research on the food that you want to start eating, how to prepare it, even watch other people prepare it so you get more comfortable making it on your own. However, don\u2019t overwhelm yourself so you have less anxiety surrounding it and it will make it easier on you to make the change. \n\nI have a fear of undercooked meat as well but once you start getting comfortable with cooking for yourself it\u2019s super easy to cook meat the right way! \nI\u2019m also 26 and I was in the same boat up until this year. I feel a lot better now that I\u2019m eating healthier and I honestly enjoy eating way more and I crave healthier food more than any other types of food. I still enjoy eating out as well, just be mindful of what you\u2019re ordering from where. But having an unhealthy meal every now and then is still okay too. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this, I believe in you!! It\u2019s so much fun going on a health journey, you can take as much time as you need.

Maybe it could help you, too!\n\n\nAnother tip is to remember that the longer the list of ingredients, the more processed the product is.\u00a0\n\n\nGood luck on your journey!!!", "Clean eating is basically no seed oils, no artificial or natural flavors (natural flavors could mean thousands of things and it\u2019s not regulated), no dyes, organic when possible, no enriched flours, no fake sugars but natural sweeteners like maple syrup, honey, coconut, and dates, no preservatives or caking agents, no fast food etc. \n\nI feel like everyone has their own preferences for clean eating. Like for me I won\u2019t eat anything with cane/ artificial/ or processed sugars or anything above 4gs added sugar. I buy organic when I can but try not to stress when I can\u2019t. I make sure things I buy that are boxed have a short ingredient list and I can pronounce and recognize the ingredients. The only fast food I\u2019ll eat if I have to is chipotle & Panera bread (which is very rare.) For honey you want to make sure it\u2019s local. Grocery stores can add fillers and it won\u2019t be listed. Not sure about maple syrup but I always buy that local too. Beware of stevia (which is natural) because it\u2019s usually added with a filler. I just switched to the liquid stevia and it\u2019s lasting way longer than thought it would which is great because it\u2019s pricey. Read the labels on EVERYTHING. Even some of the liquid stevias I was seeing also included natural flavors. \n\nSurprisingly I actually buy a lot of my boxed items in the gluten free section.  Some brands to consider: Siete (chips, tortillas, sauces, etc. they have a lot), Simple Mills (snacks), LesserEvil (snacks), Briana\u2019s (dressings & marinades). Luckily a lot of non-seed oil items will usually have it on the front of the bag and will mention avocado oil, olive oil, or coconut oil. These items will also usually have better ingredients overall. Just make sure you look at the sugar content. \n\nGoogle is your best friend, there is so much to learn!

Slow cooker meals. Dump and freezer recipes were the ones I did most often. Easy to make half your meal veggies. I even converted my childhood favorite (chicken & dumplings) into a crackpot meal, and it's the best thing I ever did.\n\n2. Bulk meat, portioned, and marinated before putting it into the freezer. Pull out what you need the night before and defrost in the fridge. Roast it with your favorite veggies. I would bake a sweet potato as well. Super lazy *cough cough*... I mean efficient! Or rice in the rice cooker. \n\n3. Cook salmon straight from the freezer! I will coat lightly with oil, put on parchment, season, and bake at 425 for 20-25 min (high altitude times, adjust for yours). Comes out amazing! And you can roast with most veggies as well on the same pan.\n\n4. Meal prep breakfast. Burritos, egg sandwiches, protein waffles, egg wraps, etc. I also have yogurt parfait items prepped so I can toss it all together in 5 min or less. \n\n5. Future plans: Currently looking to buy a home. I want one of those French door fridges. Goal is to make the wide drawer a \"salad bar.\" Can make salads, wraps, sandwiches, omelet, pizza, etc. With everything that's prepped. Make stir fry or soups, etc with the leftovers at the end of the week.\n\nPrepping ahead has been a HUGE help and success for me in the past. Find seasonings you like. Frozen veggies are OK! Canned veggies are OK! Whatever you prefer. Pinterest has also been my go-to for finding dump/freezer crock pot meals or marinades for meats. Doing the prep ahead of time (even if you don't feel like it) saves you so much hassle later on.\n\nMaking a lasagna? Double it and make a few freezer ones to heat for another night. Pair with a salad! \n\nHard boiled eggs and guacamole cups make for a super easy egg salad!\n\nI feel like my brain could keep going \ud83d\ude05 At the very least, this is a start.

I understand there has to be an effort to do those things to get where I want to be but there has to be an ultimate place for beginners to start. For example, I want SIMPLE and EASY recipes. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nBut every time I google simple or easy clean recipes, I never find what I am looking for. I guess other people's \"simple and easy\" is a recipe that calls for 10-15 items that include obscure different ingredients, and takes 2-3 different cooking methods to make the meal come together ( start to boil this, while you are frying this at the same time while mixing together that). I know that is what cooking is, but you feel me right? I want to get something SIMPLE and EASY down first that can become HABIT for me before I start following interesting and unique recipes that look super good and would love to try but the stage I am at right now looking at recipes makes me dizzy and I end up caving in and do what I always do. Frozen meals here, take out there, with smoothie recipes on the side, sourdough bread with jam for breakfast to fill me up.\n\nOne time I paid a woman $30 on this website called FIVERR to create a clean meal plan for me and silly me I thought it would be tailored to what I was experiencing but I have a feeling it was just a template meal plan she gives everyone- a general clean eating meal plan. Anyway, I purchased everything on her grocery list which was almost $100 and I was overwhelmed. I tried like 2 days of it and it was just too much and most of my veggies spoiled :( I have to start shopping for every 3 days or so until I get a groove on.

Take a bit of aluminum foil and fold it up at the corners to make a little container (can google 'fish packet' to see how).\n\nIn your little foil packet place the fish, 2-3 slices of tomato, 2 slices of lemon, and asparagus spears on top.  Squeeze the rest of the lemon so you have a fair amount of juice (bottled lemon juice works, too) and a bit of garlic in the juice (or if using onions thinly sliced, just toss them in.)\n\nSeal the packet completely (if you turn it upside down no juice should run out) and put on baking sheet.\n\nBake for 25 minutes and voila - your whole meal is done.\n\n(if you want to use a bit of oil drizzle before sealing.)\n\nWorks well with tilapia, flounder, and cod as well.\n\nIt's as easy as assembling a basic salad.  If you want something starchy it works with a baked potato (poke a few holes in skin and about 5 min in microwave on high) or brown rice (also microwavable.)\n\nBonus, works if the fish is frozen as well.  The fish steams in the lemon and juices from tomatoes which release in baking.  Delicious, clean, and super easy.\n\n\\*Tip - when buying fish I avoid anything with preservatives including carbon monoxide which is in some to preserve color.  Aldi has wild caught salmon, cod, flounder, and tilapia in the freezer section with no preservatives very reasonably priced."]}

Losing weight isn't a bad goal, but it's important to remember that the number on the scale is not the only (and not always the most important) aspect of health. Make sure that your weight loss is done in a healthy, sustainable way. Don't take weird drugs or supplements, starve yourself, or do anything that would make you lose weight very quickly (doing so can mees up your metabolism in the long run). Exercise in ways you find enjoyable, get plenty of sleep, and drink plenty of water \n\n2. The higher calorie content of wholer foods is probably due to the fact that they contain more healthy fats and protein. Yes calories may be higher, but fats, protein, and unrefined carbs keep you feeling full significantly longer than the calories you typically find in processed foods. So yes while you may take in more calories in the moment, staying fuller will result in less snacking and less calories consumed over time. It's also important to be really mindful of your eating habits too. Before I eat anything, I always try to ask myself \"ok am I actually hungry right now or do I just need water or a nap?\"\n\n3. Processed foods typically contain more sugar, which spikes your insulin and actually makes it more difficult to lose weight, even if the calories are less. Idk the scientific way to explain it but basically, your body CANNOT burn fat if your insulin levels are high.\n\n4. If you're still concerned about calories, I reccomend getting a calorie tracking app for the peace of mind. Also bookmarking websites that have a variety of clean eating recipies. It can be overwhelming at first, but there's so many resources out there to help.\n\nHope this was helpful!", "Fresh fruits and veggies are your friends.

Avoid the middle aisles of the store as much as possible.

If you are going to venture down the aisles, look for items that have 5 ingredients or less. \n3. Stay away from High Fructose Corn syrup. It's a manufactured product that your body doesn't know what to do with. Sugar is better, turbinado or raw sugar is best. \n4. Use maple syrup instead of \"pancake\" syrup.

I've made a similar life change in the past month, after let's just say surrouded by a green haze for the past twenty years or so.  After about three weeks of night sweats, and poor sleep, it's getting much better, and it will for you too.   \n\nGive it at least three weeks total, it's going to be the toughest right now, and doubt will creep in everyhwere; it's just human nature when a change happens, but it's the best (some might say, the only thing) to induce growth.  \n\nWhen I quit soda pop about 12 years ago, it was tough for at least the first month, I couldn't really believe how much so.\n\nBy you changing your food consumption towards the eat clean lifestyle, think of it like your Neo in \"the Matrix,\" before he took the coloroed pill that opened his eyes to the reality of the true situation.  You've been conditioned (as most of us have) to believe eating these crap foods are the normal way of life, and so once the huge change like you've done, it's pretty alarming to the body as it becomes dependent on the salt, sugar, and bad fats that are abundant in the modern processed diet, and so there will be withdrawls, (as sugar for example, light up the same region of your brain as cocaine, and rats in studies have had an easier time quitting cocaine than sugar!)\n\nYou may not be getting enough calories too as you speculate; making any kind of difficult, life changing altertation often dims appetite (when I made that change in the last month even though I read about and was forewarned about appetite loss, I felt like I was eating similarily, but I lost 10# so I defintely wasn't).\n\nJust know, it won't be tougher than it is now, and you're probably at least halfway through the toughest part.   With my experience, though sleep suffered, and there was a little bit of nauseau, I still had more mental and physical energy than I can remember.\n\nAs for the headache drink plenty of water, as that's the most common reason for a headache the vast majority of the time.\n\nWith my personal training clients making food changes, they've reported some of the similar things you have, but they don't last, and usually however bad you're feeling now, it will balance out with similar goodness in the next few weeks.\n\nStay strong brother (or sister) and give it at least two more weeks, it will be the best decision you've ever made for personal health, and once you get pas the three week mark, you'll NEVER look back.", "First few weeks are the toughest. Once over the hump, you\u2019ll start to feel great with more energy.  It\u2019s a big change, one that most can\u2019t stay with long enough to make.  You can do it. "]}

Have you ever tried an apple topped with honey? The first time I ate this combination, I knew I wouldn't ever eat industrial sweets. It was like heaven. I thought to myself that healthy food is much more delicious and nutritious for me than anything processed food could give me. \n\nYou can do this. I never thought of myself that I could do this. I ate a bag of chips daily for a year. I don't crave chips any more because chips are poisonous. I don't crave any type of fast food or junk food because it is pure poison. It's about the mindset, that will bring you success. \nAll beginnings are hard, but you will thank yourself in a month when you see progress and that will keep you going and stop you from going back. Give yourself some time to adapt to new habits and the rest will be easy. Start treating yourself like you would treat someone you love. Hope that helps :)", "Girl, health is hard. You have a battle ahead of you but you've got this. There are a hundred great social media folks that show great high protein and lower bad stuff recipes you can use. Find foods you love and find good alternatives and keep at it. It's a marathon not a sprint. You are perfect now. Always remember that. Perfect and worthy. If you want to be healthier,  you can be. Walk while listening to music or books and love yourself and life. I intend to join you.", "What kind of nutrition do you follow?"]}

{"title": "Plant Based Clean Eating, Where Are the Calories?", "selftext": "TLDR: Seeking recommendations for high calorie, plant based, clean eating food and snacks.  \n\n\nI was diagnosed with osteoporosis last autumn, at age 39, primarily due to cancer treatment. I began weight training and working on my overall fitness that December to try to combat the bone loss, but did not see any change in my body; this led me to a dietitian back in February. Turns out I unintentionally starve myself which is why I have difficulty building muscle and bone. Since then, I've adopted clean eating habits and now track my calories to ensure that I get enough each day. (As a side note, I've followed a plant based diet for the last 12 years.)  \n\n\nSince February, I've lost about 25 pounds, which was not my goal. I'm noticing a little bit of muscle mass and I have changed my workouts to encourage more muscle building, but I still tend show a slight loss of muscle and bone each month along with the fat, which is very discouraging. My dietitian has upped my caloric intake recommendation twice since February, so that  I am now trying to consume 2000 calories a day on a plant based, clean eating diet.   \n\n\nThere is the background, here is the point: I cannot seem to find \\*high calorie\\* plant based foods that fall under the clean eating guidelines.

Also ethnic stores sometimes have veggies for pretty cheap a price.\n\nA chia seed pudding is another pick me up that can me made so quick at home.

Once you buy the ingredients you're kinda committed cook it or it's going bad and it becomes expensive to be lazy. \n\n We used to do planning/shopping on weekends, but now we pick recipes and make a shopping list on Tues then hit the stores on Wednesday, that way we can relax on the weekend. Plus, much less shopping crowds.\n\nAlso personally we make leftovers when we eat dinner so we don't have to plan lunch. Lunch is always left overs. This makes planning every week SUBSTANTIALLY easier. Breakfasts are simple (I wing it), lunch are leftovers, so that makes it just 7 recipes a week. \n\nOh, our resources is \"clean food crush\". Have to admit that most of her stuff is so damn good.. we often feed friends who aren't on a \"clean eating\" diet and they wouldn't know we are except for the lack of empty carbs like rice and bread.

This mostly meant realizing that a larger proportion of fresh foods will spoil faster, so we needed less stuff in our fridge and better ways to access the stuff at the back so that it didn't languish there.  This meant clear bins, mostly, for how we organized the fridge... but also just a tendency to have it be a lot less full all the time. \n\n\\-- We realized that we'd need to shop much more frequently and that we needed to tolerate food waste/spoilage while we developed new habits.\n\n\\-- We completely vanquished unclear products from the kitchen.  First we drew down what we could and then when there was just a little bit left, we started tossing stuff   Felt very good.\n\n\\-- The whole instagram pantry \"clear bin\" organizing trend has some value: when things are out of their packages and uniform, you start to see the food in your kitchen as an inventory rather than a giant messy collection of marketing messages.  Helps a lot with bringing greater intention to your whole process.\n\n\\-- We invested in a NYTimes Cooking subscription.

Nuts, olives, unpasteurized sauerkraut and fruits are  eaten raw for example. \n\nClean eating is greatly balanced. You have your sweets, salty and fatty foods. Keep always in mind that you are doing this not as a diet, it's more of a lifestyle thing like veganism. We want to be healthy, that's why we do it. You can't be healthy when eating these forbidden fruits.\nKeep up the good work!! Many pounds will come off soon. I lost almost 15kg in 2 months and I never felt this great in my life."]}

Fixed meal plan for me is just a plan that you follow the entire week, you don't make any drastic changes (maybe the only changes are when you don't have certain food for your \"diet\"). You should make it simple and sustainable. You know exactly what you have for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nMindful eating for me, on the other hand, is when you don't have any plan and just trust your instincts ; hunger and fullness cues. You eat only WHEN you feel you need food and WHAT food you need. You can easily have a scramble and toast for breakfast today, but tomorrow you can have a fruit smoothie or a bowl of oatmeal. And mindful eating for me is also when you're aware of food that is beneficial for your health, looking and performance and what has bad effect on your own body.\n\nSo, I've clearified these 2 terms and now I would like to get your opinion on what I should choose. I'm really stucked right now and can't find what works best for me. I've been searching for the answer a really long time. Hopefully, there is someone, who can help me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nThanks for reading.

Symptoms came pretty quickly after with pretty intense bloating, acid reflux, nausea, and increased anxiety.  I'm wondering if it's a coincidence or if it's possible to get such quick symptoms from a few grains. \n\nFor context, I've been \n\u2022 vegetable oil free for almost 3 months,\n\u2022 gluten, dairy, soy free for 4 months\n\u2022 grain free for 1 month. \n\nThe only reason I ate those foods today was because I didn't have access to other foods and my blood sugar was very low(pre-diabetic).

{"title": "Food item check for \"clean\"", "selftext": "I have just started my eating clean journey. I have a question about a few of my food items.  \n\n\nAvocado Oil Mayo: Before starting this, I bought avocado oil mayo to be healthier. All the ingredients are natural whole foods except EDTA. It is the very last ingredient, so I imagine there isn't much in it. Is this a no, then? I am hoping not. Everything else in the ingredient list is real whole foods. \n\nButter: We have a bulk butter stash, all great value brand, in our freezer. The unsalted butter lists pasteurized cream (milk), natural flavoring as the ingredients. I am confused why that natural flavoring is there since the salted version by the same brand is just pasteurized cream (milk), salt. So does this mean I just need to avoid the unsalted, but can have the salted one? Yes, I am aware that is is better to do grass-fed butter, but that is going to be a no go with our grocery budget. \n\nGranola: I buy the bear naked brand and put it on plain yogurt. I love it. I checked all the ingredients on the three flavors that I buy. For the most part, the sugar they use is natural: honey. But one of them has sugar listed in the cranberry ingredients and another has sugar listed in the banana chip ingredients. So the granola as a whole is sweetened with just honey, but they have sugar added one of the fruits in the granola. Because it is so minor, I am hoping this isn't a huge deal. If so, is there a better granola brand out there?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSnacks: any recommendations for clean eating snacks that are already prepared? I work for a few hours in the day while a nanny is watching my kids, so it causes me to eat lunch a little bit later in the day, as I need to use the whole time my nanny is here to work, not make lunch. So I get by with snacks. I have always used raisins, trail mixes with just fruit and nuts, apple, oranges, and plain yogurt with granola as my snacks. All my trail mixes have added sugar, I discovered, and I already mentioned the issue with the granola. So any other ideas?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanEating/comments/vll1ty/food_item_check_for_clean/", "created_utc": 1656297791.0, "score": 1, "author": "dsrt16", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CleanEating/comments/vll1ty/food_item_check_for_clean/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Honestly? You are better off making your own avocado oil mayo than buying it, I'd imagine it gets costly trying to keep on buying that compared to making your own xxx\n\nBut tbh I recommend you check out the Bobby Approved app !! <3 Because it lists alternatives within the store and whatnot. So you won't be left wondering what you should do instead. Certain things aren't the end of the world- like the natural flavoring in the butter, it's not like you'd be eating straight up butter. Better get unsalted than salted, salt isn't bad for you and the goverment's recommendation for salt intake- like a lot of things- is nonsense. But it's about the flavor. So it's up to your own personal choice. \n\nHope this helps!", "Bobby app is a good one! Primal Kitchen is a good mayo. Granola isn\u2019t a thing I buy so can\u2019t help you there but grass-fed butter by Kirkland or the Ghee brands are good. Check out Flavcity on IG. Great knowledge!"]}

Otherwise, I eat the same things day in and day out, I have learnt how much tolerance I can have (eg: I normally eat 125g raw 5% beef or pork mince at dinner, it's roughly 26-27g protein. If I am hungry/fancy it/have worked out hard that day, I'll add one egg, maybe two, to the mix -> won't mess up my macros nor my training; same goes with veggies, if I can't have 100g of mushrooms and green beans at dinner, and swap them out with similar things eg courgettes and cherry tomatoes, I won't go crazy trying to log the new things and make them work)"]}
