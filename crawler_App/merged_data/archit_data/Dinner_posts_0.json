Leave it for 2 hours at least.\nFinely dice one shallot & a few green chillies.\nOther veggies include cabbage, green beans, mushrooms & bell peppers.\n    Cooking steps: Heat up some vegetable oil in a large pot. Throw in the shallot & green chillies with a healthy amount of gochugaru. Saut\u00e9 em for like 30 seconds & then add in your marinated pork. Cook it till the colour darkens & a little bit of char forms on the meat. Add your veggies & continue cooking for 7-8 mins. Then water for the soup. Let it come up to a boil. Add soy sauce, black vinegar, fresh ginger garlic paste & another spoonful of gochujang. Continue simmering & check for heat & salt. Now for the not so Korean part, I add a bit of Indian Chicken masala while the soup is simmering. You may skip this step but the combo actually works & the flavour is just beautiful. And that\u2019s basically it, continue cooking & the soup\u2019s done.\n\nSpinach with garlic & sesame:\nI just heated up a pan with a tiny amount of oil. Threw in sliced garlic & then the spinach. Cooked until the greens shrank and added salt, black pepper & drizzled sesame oil. Garnish with sesame seeds & you are done.\n\nHot & sweet pork chops:\n    Prep: Take your pork chops & using a fork poke holes into it. For the marination, mix ginger garlic paste, soy sauce, black vinegar, gochujang, honey, salt, msg, sesame oil. Again, marinate for two hours at least.\n    Cooking: I used a cast iron skillet to cook the chops but you can use stainless steel as well. Just not non-stick. You want the marinate to stick a little bit & give a bit of that burnt flavour to the meat. Don\u2019t overcook it please.\n\nWhite Rice:\nI\u2019m not teaching you how to cook rice.

I used sirloin cause it\u2019s what I had in the freezer.  \n  \n1 head broccoli washed and cut into bite size pieces  \n  \nSoy sauce\n\nOyster sauce\n\nRice wine vinegar\n\nChicken broth or chicken bouillon mixed into warm water\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n2 teaspoons ginger (I used it from a tube but can use fresh)\n\n4 dried red chilis with seeds (this is optional)\n\nGochugaru (korean chili flakes, also optional. I like everything spicy)\n\nSugar\n\nWhite pepper (can use black)\n\nBaking soda\n\nCornstarch\n\nNeutral oil (vegetable or whatever you have)\n\n\n\nMarinate the beef:\n\nCut the beef into strips, put it in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add 1tbsp soy sauce, 3tbsp cornstarch and 1tsp baking soda. Mix well and let sit for 30 minutes.\n\n\n\nMake the sauce:\n\nCombine approx \u00bc cup soy sauce, \u00bc cup chicken broth (could probably just use water here and balance out the flavor to your taste with the other ingredients), 1tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1tbsp oyster sauce, sugar to taste, gochugaru to taste, white pepper to taste. Mix together and set aside. You can add more liquid so you have more sauce, just play with it until it\u2019s the amount you want and it tastes good to you.\n\n\n\nBlanch the broccoli:\n\nBoil a pot of water and add broccoli. Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute. Drain and set aside.\n\nCook the beef and broccoli:  \n  \nAdd neutral oil to pan over med-high heat. When it\u2019s hot, add the beef and stir fry for a few minutes until cooked. Remove beef from pan and set aside. To the same pan add in the minced garlic, ginger and dried red chilis and saute for about 30 seconds. Add meat and broccoli back into the pan. Pour the sauce into the pan and saute everything together for a minute or two. Now add cornstarch slurry (1 tbsp cornstarch mixed into 2 tbsp water) to the pan and mix everything together well, cooking for another or minute or two until the sauce is thickened. Serve over rice or can make a noodle stir fry.\n\nEdited to add: top with sesame seeds if you have them", "Looks amazing!!", "Looks legit!"]}

{"title": "I cooked [ prime rib roast ] reverse sear.", "selftext": "Not feeling great, but my kids really wanted it. This was the laziest oven roast I\u2019ve done. While waiting for beef to get to room temp, I sealed it in various spices, oils, marinade mix, just for an hour or so. Maybe a bit longer. Set in oven on convection roast, around 225. It went until internal temp was about 125, the took out to rest. Loose cover with foil and vented an hour. Popped oven up to 475, then put roast in to sear. Like I said I was just not well today, so it went a bit longer on the sear. Kids like it more done anyway, but I prefer it more rare. This was about 130-135 after sear. It was soft enough to glide right through with a horribly dull knife. lol. It tastes amazing. Green beans were just a big frozen bag defrosted, pan fried with garlic n butter, lightly salted oh and onion powder too. Mashed potatoes with way too much heavy cream n butter. And just popped some Hawaiian rolls in oven to warm a bit. OH! Gravy made with pan dripping, beef bone stock, various spices, heavy cream and milk, just basic. Thickened with a bit of corn starch and tiniest bit of white wine went in while it was boiling too.  I threw some shallot oil in it too. Anyway, I\u2019m pleased it came out pretty good tasting at least. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4v4a8", "created_utc": 1745287543.0, "score": 264, "author": "MadamTargaryen", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/dinner/comments/1k4v4a8/i_cooked_prime_rib_roast_reverse_sear/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you /u/MadamTargaryen for posting to /r/dinner!

Place oil in deep-fryer or skillet preheat to 370\u00baF. Mix 3 cups flour, salt in bowl, then whisk in beer and egg till smooth in consistency. Place remaining flour on plate.\n2. Pat walleye / cod fillets dry with paper towel then dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip each fillet one by one into batter, then gently place in hot oil.\n3. Deep fry till golden brown, turning only once. Use slotted spoon to transfer fish to a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle lightly with salt immediately! \n\nOnion Rings 2 cups all purpose flour, divided2 teaspoons paprika1 teaspoon garlic powder2 teaspoons salt1/2 teaspoon pepper12 ounces of your favorite beer 2 large Vidalia onionsVegetable or Peanut oil for frying \n\n* In a large bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of flour with the paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Whisk in the beer until the mixture is well combined. Let the batter rest at room temperature for 10-12 minutes.\n* While the batter rests, cut the tip off of the stem side of the onions then remove peel. Slice the onions horizontally into 1/2 inch thick rings and toss them with the remaining 1/2 cup of flour.\n* Add the oil to a large, Dutch oven to a depth of 2 inches and heat it over medium high heat until a deep fry thermometer reaches 375\u00b0F.\n* Working in batches, dip onion rings into prepared batter shaking off excess, then immediately drop into hot oil. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Allow the onions to cook in the oil, flipping them once to guarantee even browning, for a total of approximately 3 minutes. Remove onions with slotted spoon and transfer them to paper towel lined plate. Immediately season with salt. Repeat coating & frying process, returning the oil to 375 between batches, with remaining onions!  \n\nHomemade Tartar Sauce \n* Worcestershire sauce Mayonnaise \n* Fresh squeezed lemon juice\n* Garlic smashed to taste \n* chopped dill baby dill pickles \n* fresh or dried dill weed\u00a0\n* pepper\n* Mix all ingredients together.

I eye balled the olive oil, so I couldn\u2019t tell you how much I used. Just use enough so the chicken doesn\u2019t stick but remember you\u2019re not frying the chicken.\n\n3) Cook the seasoned chicken in a cast iron skillet with the lid. I usually eye ball the time, can\u2019t give you a specific time on how long I kept it in there. Just don\u2019t dry the chicken out.\n\n3) After flipping the chicken over, add minced garlic and butter to the cast iron pan and let the chicken finish cooking with the lid on. (The lid on locks in moisture so the chicken doesn\u2019t dry out)\n\n4) Shred the chicken once cooked. I shredded the chicken in the cast iron pan with forks. Do not remove the chicken from the cast iron pan.\n\n5) Pour heavy cream in the pan on top of the chicken.\n\n6) Add butter, tony chachere\u2019s seasoning, paprika, black pepper, red pepper flakes, parsley flakes, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian blended cheese to the heavy cream and chicken.\n\n7) Mix the pan until the cheese melts and then add your favorite noodles. I like to use spaghetti noodles, but it\u2019s whatever you like.\n\n8) Put the lid back on the pan and lower the heat to low. Let this simmer for roughly 20-30 mins. The point is to let the heavy cream thicken and the noodles and chicken to absorb everything.\n\n9) Enjoy! I like to garnish with parsley at the end, but it\u2019s your preference.", "Looks great!!", "Looks great", "Looks fkn creamy mate"]}

However you can get a great sear on the chicken in a pan, and throw them in the over for 5 minutes to finish cooking them through. Cast iron pan, and stainless steal work best for searing. Make sure you preheat your pan long enough, and toss enough oil in the pan to cover the bottom of it.\n\nAlso the last thing I love them for is stir fry.

It can be a little salty for those not used to shiojake, so feel free to decrease the salt % to ~3%.\n\nPickled mushrooms: I use this adapted [Momofuku recipe](https://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/momofukus-pickled-shiitakes-recipe-20161118-gss6ve), but use a variety of fresh mushrooms in place of dried\u2014enoki, nameko, shimeji, shiitake... whatever you can find!\n\nHiyayakko (chilled and dressed tofu): this one has no recipe as it\u2019s a quick and basic side to throw together. Use half a block of silky soft chilled tofu, cut into large cubes, top with bonito flakes, grated ginger, green onions, shiso (perilla) leafs, or any other aromatics you feel like. Keep chilled until serving, and pour about a tablespoon of soy sauce over the top.\n\nCelery Itame (quick saut\u00e9): slice celery thinly on the diagonal (in Chinese cooking this is sometimes referred to as Horse Ear shape), and quickly stir fry on high heat with a dab of Yuzu kosho (salt-cured yuzu zest and pepper blend), and a couple spoonfuls of stock, dashi powder, or even some of that mushroom pickling liquid. It\u2019s even better with thinly sliced pork, but I didn\u2019t have any on hand. You can also replace this with basically any vegetable.\n\nTamagoyaki: I use [Just Hungry\u2019s recipe](https://justhungry.com/basics-tamagoyaki-or-atsuyaki-tamago-japanese-sweet-omelette).\n\nMiso soup: Bring a small pot of dashi stock (or water) to a boil, add cubed tofu (the other half of that block from Hiyayakko) and wakame seaweed, and bring it back to a boil. Turn off the heat, add thinly sliced whites of green onion to the soup and miso in a ladle to dissolve. The important part is turning the heat off before adding the miso\u2014this is the traditional way of making miso soup and keeps all the cultures alive (assuming the prepackaged stuff is actually still full of probiotics).\n\nRice: okay, I feel kind of silly adding this one in here, but if you\u2019re gonna make a traditional Japanese meal, the rice is the star of the show. In fact, the word for \u201cmeal\u201d and the word for \u201crice\u201d are interchangeable in Japanese.\n\nI have an easy way to remember how to prepare rice on the stovetop: 1:1, 10, 10, 10.\n\nThat is... water to rice ratio is 1:1.\n\nAfter washing the rice thoroughly (I was taught 3 times), soak in it\u2019s cooking water for 10 minutes (at least).\n\nCover the pot, bring it to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.\n\nTurn off the heat, and let it steam, covered, for 10 minutes.\n\nSome prefer their rice a little softer, but I prefer \u201cal dente\u201d... if you prefer it softer, increase the water by a tablespoon or two per cup.", "Looks great!", "Really impressive!

No seasoning after the breading. Wasn\u2019t too much of a dealbreaker because the carryover flavor from the skin stuck around while eating the meat.\n\nBojangles was surprisingly good.

The skin and meat both seasoned well and flavor lasted throughout and was boosted with every bite. \n\nPopeyes good LAWD it was awful not a piece of seasoning to be found.

Preparation:\n\nDefrost and pat the wings dry before cooking.\n\n\n\n4.

Sauce:\n\nDip the wings in the sauce instead of coating them entirely\u2014this gives a better flavor balance.\n\n\n\n6. Side Dish:\n\nToss broccoli in extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n\nRoast at 400\u00b0F for 20 minutes.\n\nFinish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nThis version should be easier to follow.

I grew up with my mom making pho every Sunday before going to the temple. This is how I make it, I hope you like it. I don't measure when I cook, but I will try and guess my measurements. \n\nIngredients for stock\n\n16 quart stock pot\n\n2-3 onions peels off, left whole or cut in half.\n\n3-4 inches of ginger cut in half\n\nbeef bones (I buy whatever my butcher shop has in stock)\n\n3-4lbs of ox tails\n\n1/4 cup rock sugar \n\n1/4 cup salt\n\n1/4 cup fish sauce\n\npho seasoning bag (Old man que huong pho bac spice seasoning is the one I use often cause I don't have room in my kitchen to hold spices I don't use daily)\n\nToppings/noodles\n\nfresh pho noodles ( I buy mine at our local asian market and one bag makes about 3 medium bowls)\n\nlimes\n\ncilantro\n\ngreen onions\n\nthai basil\n\nsugar\n\nfish sauce\n\nhoisin sauce\n\nchili oil\n\nsliced jalapenos \n\ncooked tendon, sliced thin (if you want, we love it)\n\nbeef meatballs with tendon (my kids favorite)\n\nthinly sliced beef ( I buy a chuck roast and partially freeze it and slice it, I used the fatty pieces in the stock, you can use whatever you want)\n\nDirections\n\n1.  Fill your stock pot with water almost all the way to the top, leave enough room for your bones and aromatics. Put it on the stove and bring it to a boil.\n\n2. Turn your broiler on high. Line a sheet pan with foil and place your peeled onions, ginger, beef bones, and ox tails on it. Set it on the middle rack and let your meat/bones brown and your aromatics turn dark. Should take about 20 ish minutes. (I prefer doing it this way over boiling my meat to get the impurities out because I think it gives the broth more flavor)\n\n3. Put all your aromatics, bones, and ox tails in the pot and turn it down to a simmer. Add rock sugar, salt, and fish sauce. Simmer for at least 8 hours. A lot of fat well float to the top, you can skim as much or as little off as you want. I skim about half out, I think the fat gives the broth a nice mouth feel. \n\n4. After 8 hours, I like to add the spice bag for another hour or two. If you want meat balls, now would be the time to thrown them in the broth to warm up. \n\n5. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil (this is for the noodles). \n\n6. Before serving, pull out all the bones, ox tails, aromatics, and meatballs. Slice the meat balls and pull the delicious meat off the ox tails.\n\n7. Cook your fresh noodles in the boiling water for 5 seconds. I use a stainless steel blanching basket.  Set them in your bowl. Add your meatballs, sliced beef, ox tail meat, and tendon. I like to add my condiments in before I add my broth. Squeeze of lime, fish sauce, hoisin, sugar, and chili oil. Pour the broth over it and mix it up and adjust if you need to. Sprinkle over cilantro, green onion, and basil. Enjoy!"]}

You flip the bird over and cut out its spine (save for gravy), flip it back over and, using your weight, press it flat. You will probably hear/feel bones break. It\u2019s  like giving chest compressions to an already dead chicken (hmmm...tangent, that might be a good way to get people used to the sounds of chest cracking during CPR training). I would cut up potatoes and vegetables lay them on a roasting pan and put stuffing on top of that. Cut slices into the skin, like you mentioned. I prefer thin orange slices and melted butter mixed with rosemary and thyme and cracked garlic cloves. Insert that beneath the skin with the thin orange (or lemon) slices last. Place the chicken over the bed of vegetables and stuffing in the roasting pan. Season the top with whatever seasonings you prefer. Cook at 450-475 for 30 minutes with the roasting pan top on and a final 15 min with the top off to crisp the outside. Remember, times are less critical than temperature measurements deep in the chicken. The juices from the chicken/turkey will drip down and flavor the vegetables and stuffing without worrying about food poisoning for undercooking the inside of the turkey trying to keep it from getting too dry. \n\nIn the beginning, it\u2019s better to check on it often, You WILL be caught off guard as to how fast and even it cooks the first time! 3-4 years ago, i went out on a limb and tried this method ON our Thanksgiving turkey. My wife\u2019s family was basically calling me a fool because i put it in TOO late and the turkey would be raw. I wanna say, the 20lbs turkey took about 1 hour and 15. Minutes to complete. When I went to carve the turkey i pulled out my favorite, freshly sharpened, knife and the meat just fell apart. No knife needed. It was juicy all the way through and nothing was over or under cooked! Only o couple of them admitted that they were wrong and that I didn\u2019t ruin Thanksgiving dinner, but made on of the best turkeys they\u2019ve ever had.\n\nThe science behind it is that by removing the spine and making is as flat as you can, you remove that giant void in the the center, that\u2019s where the drying out starts. No matter what the temperature of your oven is, the temperature within the void is different than that of the outside of the fowl. When people stuff that void with vegetables and stuffing, that\u2019s where food poisoning can come in to play because you have now undercooked the inside and had the raw juices dripping on your vegetables and dressing. This is why when you spatchcock it, you can raise the cooking temperature, thus reducing the cook time because you eliminated that void and now goo juices are flavoring the vegetables and dressing. \n\nI am apparently addicted to stress. I would recommend doing it to a chicken on a random Tuesday night for dinner before attempting it on Thanksgiving for the first time! I never claimed to be a genius!", "To make this one, first pan fry the chicken to get the skin crispy, then jam it in the oven at 175 C (350 F) for about 50 mins with the vegetables. Season with pepper, salt, parsley, and whatever else you want. Makes a huge difference to put lemon slices underneath the chicken as it sits in the oven.", "It looks a bit dry.", "I think you did a great job!!! Looks perfect. One thing I do that no one else does anymore is put everything directly on the sheet pan. I don\u2019t use parchment paper or foil. I know it provides easy clean up but I prefer my meat and veggies to be in direct contact with the pan. They just seem to get a bit more crisp and it\u2019s worth it to have to scrub the pan.\nHow did it taste?"]}

I made this huge dinner tonight because I was hungry and wanted some egg fried rice and beef. \n\nI made 500g of beef with some tomato puree and spices (garlic cayenne pepper tons of salt/pepper and some cumin, kept it simple) \nFried it up in my trusty cast iron with some butter got it lovely and coloured. Juicy af. Drained the juices back into the skillet and got it a bit hotter, melted in some beef tallow and a bit of butter and stuck in some rice and cayenne peppers, fried them babies until it was sizzling and smelling crazy, added some tomato puree and got it all stirred in, finished frying her up and stuck it on top of the beef.  \n\nThen I scrambled a goose egg in the same skillet, didn\u2019t wash just straight in to get them flavours kicking. Got the goose egg scrambled up with some butter and beef tallow to get it crispy, added in some more rice and salt, a bit of chilli and tons of pepper. Got it all fried up and yellow and added more butter to get it golden and coloured and to stop it sticking. Tasted brilliant. \n\nThe vague ingredients go something like this\n600g beef mince \n50-75g beef tallow\n200g salted butter\nSalt (idk how much I used, but I use a lot of it, maybe ten tablespoons?)\nPepper (same amount as salt? Idk really but just cover them babies in pepper and cayenne chilli)\nCayenne pepper ^\nCumin (maybe a tablespoon for the beef, same for the rice)\nTomato puree (idk again, maybe two tablespoons on the beef, one on the rice)\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go heavy on the fat, butter, salt and maters, it\u2019s all flavour and all good for ya. \n\nSo yeah, that was my dinner.

{"title": "Salisbury Steak w/ Mushroom Gravy, Honey Glazed Carrots & Mashed Potatoes.", "selftext": "I broke this recipe down into the different parts. You can make the patties a day ahead if you like and put them in the fridge on parchment paper.  Use whatever mushrooms you prefer.  I like to use the yellow potatoes in my mash.  \n\nSalisbury Steaks: \n1 large egg\n1/2 cup breadcrumbs\n1 tablespoon ketchup\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 pound lean ground chuck (I used 93% lean)\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\nYour Mushrooms: \n2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 pound sliced mushrooms\n4 garlic cloves crushed \nYour Gravy: \n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n3 tablespoons all purpose flour\n2.5 cups low sodium beef broth\n1 tablespoon steak sauce\n1 tablespoon tomato paste \n\u00a0\nTo make the steak patties combine the egg, breadcrumbs, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper and stir together until well combined. Add the ground chuck and mix until well combined. Use your hands to form into four patties.\nDrizzle a large saut\u00e9 pan with olive oil and bring the pan to medium heat. Lay the patties in the pan in a single layer and cook for 3-5 minutes until the bottom is golden. Flip and cook for another 3-5 minutes until beef steaks are cooked through. Remove to a side plate and cover.\nTo make the mushrooms, add olive oil to the saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add sliced mushrooms and stir to toss in oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-6 minutes until the mushrooms are softened and gold around edges. Add crushed garlic. Stir and cook for another 60 seconds. Remove to the side plate with meat patties and cover to keep warm.\nTo make the gravy, add butter to saut\u00e9 pan and melt over low heat.  Add flour and whisk to combine: it will make sort of a paste \u2013 don\u2019t worry about anything stuck to the bottom of the pan from what was already in it.  It will come up when you add your liquid. Add in the broth a little bit at a time stirring to combine as you go so that the flour dissolves into the broth and you scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the Beef broth, steak sauce and tomato paste and whisk into the sauce. Raise the heat to bring the sauce to a boil, stirring regularly, and then reduce the heat to low to simmer. Simmer uncovered for a minute until the gravy thickens a bit.\nTo finish the dish, add the mushrooms and steak patties back into the pan, along with any juices on the plate. Spoon some gravy over the top of the steaks and mix the mushrooms into the sauce. Cover the pan partially with a lid set slightly askew, and leave the burner on low for five minutes until warmed through, stirring occasionally. Garnish with parsley. \nOven Roasted Carrots\nOne pound of fresh carrots cut lengthways. \nExtra-virgin olive oil - this helps carrots soften and brown in the oven\nHoney is a trick that my Nana taught me growing up cooking with her.  It lightly glazes the carrots and highlights the sweetness. \nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper. \nPlace the carrots in a large bowl. Toss them with the honey, olive oil, salt, and pepper, mixing well to  coat them.\nSpread in a single layer on a sheet pan at 425 and roast for 40-50 minutes turning as needed. Check often so honey doesn\u2019t burn.  Garnish with fresh parsley! \n\nI serve with homemade mashed potatoes and the yummy gravy!  \n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y7ewiceb21re1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742992074.0, "score": 62, "author": "KarinsDogs", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/dinner/comments/1jkak5k/salisbury_steak_w_mushroom_gravy_honey_glazed/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you /u/KarinsDogs for posting to /r/dinner!

Whisk until smooth and combined. The sauce will be on the thinner side. Make sure to use full fat greek yogurt for a thicker garlic sauce!\n\n\nInstructions\nAdd chicken to a large ziplock bag along with all of the ingredients except the chopped fresh parsley. Cover and store in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.\n\n\nWhen you are ready to cook preheat oven to 425 F degrees. Place chicken in a greased baking dish and bake until golden brown and cooked through. (Mine took about 15 minutes because the chicken was on the thinner side).

Let saut\u00e9 5 minutes. Add broth, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until the leeks are tender for 10 minutes. Uncover and cook until almost all the liquid is gone.  It\u2019s ok if your leeks have some nice color.  Transfer the leeks to a bowl. Stir in cheese until well mixed. \n\nIn another pan over medium heat, melt the rest of the butter add to the mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until the mushrooms are soft about 5-6 minutes. \n\nPreheat oven to 400.

Wash the chicken wing pieces with 3 quarts of water mixed with \u00bc cup salt and 2 tablespoons white vinegar. Then drain and dry them with paper towels.  \n2.

Deep fry the chicken in batches for about 12 minutes or until fully cooked (no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear) and golden brown on all sides.
