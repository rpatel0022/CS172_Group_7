We had the owner come with her family. Coworker told me go stay on left side to essentially run expo. So I did. No point in arguing.

You want to be in charge, fine. Fail without my help. When it came to the 13 steaks, she asked me to cook them. So I did my thing. She rushed the plating and we had a lot of red plates. I was asked by the actual hotel manager to re-plate. I go to do that and my coworker snatched the romesco out of my hand and told me to get out of the way so she could plate them.

I've had women take pictures with me. Leave me positive reviews in their reviews for the hotel. I just can't figure out why the fuck she is so rude to me. \nAny advice please.

So fast forward to today, it\u2019s gotten way worse because we work with an indoor charcoal grill and our hoods haven\u2019t been working properly. So now my throat is hurting the worst in my life and I\u2019m having a hard time breathing and i\u2019m in excruciating pain. Yesterday, I coughed all day at work and the sou chef was mimicking my coughing and making fun of me and told me I was faking it. The head chef is super nice and he\u2019s way more respectful. I feel like I need to call out today because a simple sore throat and slight fever has now turned into breathing problems and excruciating lung and throat pain. Every cough my lungs burn so badly. Any advice? I\u2019m good at my job I do saut\u00e9 and I\u2019ve sacrificed a lot to be as good as I\u2019ve been and i\u2019ve been nothing but reliable.

I was only trained very, very briefly before the head chef and the other prep cooks quit. One of my duties is to prep the vegetarian egg roll mix. I use the robot coupe to cut the cabbage, carrots, and celery. When I was trained to prepare it, the girl who trained me did NOT wash any of the produce. I even questioned her about not washing it and she said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019ve only been working in kitchens for a year and the place I worked at before my current job did not wash the produce either. I asked the manager there, too, about washing the produce and was told it wasn\u2019t necessary. I always wash my produce at home, but somehow just convinced myself that maybe restaurants don\u2019t do it and I\u2019m just overly paranoid. Long story short, after preparing the egg roll mix today and cleaning up my station, we found an earthworm cut up on the table (I\u2019m assuming it was inside a head of cabbage). I tossed the entire mix so none of it was eaten.

As someone that\u2019s worked everything from a dish pit to chef/kitchen manager I prefer jeans hands down to anything else. I\u2019ve had hot grease hit me many times and the \u2018oil resistant\u2019 poly blend crap chefs pants are made of literally just melted to my skin. Wranglers and thicker denim have never done that. And for those that say that denim is not flexible, does not breathe, and isn\u2019t heat resistant knows nothing about fabric. Denim absolutely is more flexible and is a thicker fabric than most \u2018chefs clothing\u2019 is ever made of. The stuff supposedly for kitchens is literally the same as medical scrubs.\n\nAs for the grease issue. \n\nTreat the stain right away with a degreaser. Like Dawn. Scrub at it until you get a nice foam and let it sit for a few minutes then rinse with HOT water. Gotta be stupid hot temp for the oils to break down and rinse out.\n\nAlso for when you wash your clothes arm and hammer has an excellent brand of laundry detergent that is designed for going after and breaking down heavy grease and soil stains. It\u2019s the one with Oxi Clean. I throw all my work clothes (aprons, chefs coat, jeans, bandannas, all of it including under garments) into the wash at the end of shift. The detergent gets added then I add about a cup of baking soda around the top. Then a cup of white vinegar. I know we\u2019re now cooking in the washer. And performing fun experiments!  Set your cycle to normal and water temp to HOT.  That should help. I know none of us want or can really afford to throw everything in the wash at the end of the day (mentally or physically) but the longer the clothes sit with that in them the more likely the oil will just permanently bond with the cotton fibers. On the flip side it could eventually make them oil and water resistant. Also don\u2019t forget to swap the load so you\u2019ve got your stuff ready for next shift. I\u2019ve totally forgotten that a few times. Or just had to dress myself from the dryer.", "Brown paper bags are your answer. \n\nGet your Iron and iron the item with brown paper on either sides of the item.

Was a while ago, synthetic material", "Rub the oil stain with white chalk and let the chalk dust absorb the oil for a bit then wash.  \n\nIf it\u2019s still there, rub the oil stain with the blue dawn dish soap, let it soak, then wash.", "My first thought is to drop them in a bucket or tub when you get home & pour straight degreaser over them. Insist that the restaurant give you a jug when you need it. Agitate by hand, rinse, repeat, then throw in the wash.

I would be concerned about the fat starting to accumulate in your washer. \n\nDon't know if it will make clothes last longer but at least you'll have cleaner and nicer feeling clothes.\n\nIf possible, air dry because heat can make oil and other stains set into the fabric.\n\nI don't think waxed jeans will be a solution, I'm not a denim expert but oil can break apart oil.

(I assume it's probably different for certain broths)\n\nBecause I want to go all out and learn as much as possible, I'd like to use four different types of chicken broth. Each question will apply to each broth, and I know that's an absurd number of things to answer, so just answer what you can.\n\nThe four types of broth are:\n\nA. Meat, Bone, Mirepoix  \nB.

I explained how close I lived, and she told me she doesnt believe that(she was trying to say I ordered the food along time ago, and let it sit, I guess she forgot reciepts have time stamps on them???!!!!).

Will clean up formatting after I post 'cause it looks like shit:\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomer Letter | U.S. Tariff and Trade Policies\n\nDate: April 29, 2025\n\nTo our Valued Customer,\n\nSysco has been preparing for and responding to evolving trade policies, including the United States\u2019 announcement of a 10% reciprocal tariff on nearly all imports and a tariff of at least 145% on products from China.\n\nThe newest tariffs do not apply to goods from Canada and Mexico that comply with the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nOur goal is to provide customers with transparency, alternatives and options to help minimize impacts and disruption to their businesses. Our Tariff Task Force has identified products and items that could be impacted by as well as thousands of alternative products to minimize cost increases and supply chain disruptions. Your sales representative can assist in helping you find alternative products when possible.\n\nIn addition, we are making additional changes and updates to our product lists and how we operate to both meet the moment and ensure we provide you with quality products at a good value.\n\nHere are a few things we are implementing to help provide you the best service:\n\n* Identifying product alternatives, including locally grown and locally produced items, to help minimize the impact these tariffs will have on your business and your customers.\n* Creating better internal visibility on product Country of Origin so we can more quickly identify which items require alternatives and provide you with options and relevant information.\n* Daily Tariff Task Force meetings to respond quickly to new developments.\n\nAs the largest food distributor in the world with thousands of suppliers, tens of thousands of products and a global workforce of more than 76,000 people in 10 countries, we are well-positioned to provide solutions. We want to emphasize that as this situation continues to evolve, there remains some uncertainty regarding whether there will be exceptions on specific products or categories. We will continue to closely monitor the situation, update the list of alternatives, and communicate regarding the steps we are taking to minimize disruption to you and your business.\n\nFor items that will be subject to tariffs, those costs will be passed through, so we encourage you to review the list of alternative products designed to minimize cost increases and impacts to your business. Tariff cost increases will not be a separate line item on invoices. We appreciate your continued partnership and trust in Sysco and look forward to helping you and your business succeed.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSysco Corporation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kbjhge/sysco_letter_regarding_tariffs/", "created_utc": 1746027328.0, "score": 72, "author": "Paradigm_Reset", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kbjhge/sysco_letter_regarding_tariffs/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["> Tariff cost increases will not be a separate line item on invoices.\n\n\nThe only reason not to do this is because they don't want you to know how much they're paying\u00a0", "FUCKING COWARDS - Sysco breaks out tax on our invoice.

{"title": "Not sure what to do, need some help", "selftext": "I went to culinary school, did my internship (sorta) loved it, it was casual fine dining and was quite hard especially because it was my first job, the first 3 months were tough I was quite bad and one of the chefs was always on my back, not bullying more so he was pushing me to make me better and I knew that. Still, it was tough being told off every day. \n\nThat chef left, I stayed part time and loved it. A new chef came in, Je was great and felt more like a mate than my boss. However, my skill did suffer. Eventually that chef got really sick of the other staff and kinda turned sour on everyone, so made it a bit shit for a while but I always looked forward to going into work. \n\nThen, the restaurant closed. Quite suddenly, and I found myswlf without a job but I decided to stay unemployed until I finished college in 6 months. I finished college and the tough chef from before called me, he was the head chef of a Michelin recommended place and needed staff. \n\nSo, I found a temporary place to stay, started the job, did well on my first day I fit into their service quite well and that was it. Then I started the following week, I hated the whole day, I wasn't fast enough and I was messing up, I was anxious because of this and completely thrown off, I had gone back to before where he was mocking me for getting stressed and little things. The pressure really got to me and I decided not to come back in. It was definitely a temporary solution to the problem. I moved back home and said I was done being in kitchens, I couldn't handle it. I thought of this as an opportunity to get out and try new things. Then, a few months later I ended up trialing in a few places, the same standard as the place I had left. Just in case it was just an issue with the chef and not the actual job as a whole. \n\nI found the perfect job that said they'd love to have me, they were committed to training me up and genuinely felt like they wanted me there. The chef had worked around 2/3 star places so I knew he would be good to learn from. But the day before I was meant to start he calls me saying he was let go, and the new chef that was coming in didmt need anybody so I was out of a job. I was distraught.\n\nI'm still at home and ended up getting a local pizza job aswell as a minimum wage job in a shop bakery but I feel like a bum. After working for better money, with more responsibility, good produce, coming up with menus, learning every day and working to a good standard I feel like I've just gone so backward. I'm making videos on the side and that keeps me sane but I just don't feel like I'm doing enough. \n\nI also feel like I don't want to work in a kitchen but I'm really not sure. Is it worth the hours and pain? Am I thinking too much into the future? I'm afraid I'll get stuck and not be able to pursue other things. I love working with food but that chef has really gotten in my head and I feel like I have some sort of PTSD reaction when I get into a new kitchen, it's really weird, I'm not even bothered by shouting but the pressure I feel during prep especially just makes me numb. I've also developed a chronic pain that I believe is a result of the stress. \n\nIf I'm not going to pursue cheffing, what else can I do ? I like making videos and everything else to do with food but I feel like such a fraud because I haven't worked that long in kitchens.

{"title": "Same old story", "selftext": "To start, I'm not a chef coat or a trained chef or anything. I've worked in a lot of kitchens, Pizza, Italian, wings, bars, tacos. I'm just a well seasoned cook, pun intended. I've been in management as well a couple of times. This is more of a \"Who can relate? Any advice\" post\n\nThe place I'm at right now, I love. I've never worked in a kitchen like this, it's super free, we kick ass, we make awesome food, no uniforms, no one breathing down our necks, no camera jockies. We are probably the most popular spot in our city.\n\nEverywhere I have worked, the story is always the same. There is this neverending quarrel between AM and PM. Granted our guys can work both sometimes, but for the most part the same people work specific shifts. We are all really good friends and get along very well and work well together.\n\nWe have a few issues in our kitchen but the one that's the most frequent is Morning crew always has some complaint, against the way night crew closed. We either did something, didn't do something, forgot something, didnt clean something or whatever. From time to time there is a real issue like someone leaving the fryers on but for the most part it's trivial nonsense.\n\nOver the 3 years I have been here I have tried to tighten up wherever someone had a complaint about the way I close, I might get butthurt but I try to improve.\n\nThe big issue lately has been two openers complain that the line didn't get stocked, or someone didnt wash a dish or something. I don't keep score, if I come in and the line isn't stocked I just get it done (the other main night guy feels the same way) I come in and there's no cheese, no steak, no rice, no one stocked the cold line, no tortillas so on and so on. And I'm not telling myself \"OOOOh I'm gonna have a talk with them tomorrow, oooooo this feels personal, they suck at their job.\" Nah, it's like it never happened. I want things to be right. However we know to stock the line for the morning it's important to do that and if it isn't getting done, then it's a problem.\n\nBut I find myself paranoid everyday I come in to close of what complaint the AM guys are going to pull me aside to discuss as if it the end of the world. To clarify it's our aim to leave everything buttoned up and clean and stocked but you can't babysit everyone all the time. The newer guy I'm closing with already has the line covered and I assume, knowing he knows what's expected, that he did his job.\n\nRecently the AM guy gets me alone on a Sunday and starts talking about how the line wasn't stocked right and it's a real issue for him, it feels like and I quote \"A personal attack.\" and someone found a queso pan uncleaned under the cutting board drying on the sink and we cant be leaving dishes unwashed. He goes on and on, the other AM guy (we're all good friends btw) chimes in and you can tell they have been talking about this all day.\n\nThe entire time this conversation is happening I am standing in front of a load of AM prep dishes that aren't cleaned and these two have already clocked out. And not just a few either, I'm talking pans, pots, cambros, sieves you name it. They aren't planning on doing them either. At the same time, I know that the line isn't stocked for night crew...in fact I could have accurately predicted which items weren't stocked because they never are. And this pile of dishes would make me upset if it weren't ALWAYS the case, like it is every Sunday. Likewise when I come in I know not only will there be dishes in some form unfinished, and a line that needs attention, I know I will find someone bent over the line on their phone, or standing near or behind the bar. Which, only exacerbates my frustration.\n\nI'm a lazy SOB sometimes too, I'm not perfect, if I make a mistake I do my best to own it and not get an ego. But I don't keep score, I try not to, it will take me less than 10 minutes to remedy the line not being restocked and someone can take some initiative to do the dishes. As frequent as an issue might be for AM when they come in, its likely 3 times more frequent for night crew, and AM wouldn't hear about it because we're just gonna get it done and move on. Even though it's important for us to have everything ready to go at night because were in the middle of the work day right before dinner rush and you can argue, despite a prep list, AM has 3 hours to deal with something before hand. Still we try to close to open and the favor should be returned.\n\nAt the end of my day I have to make sure they have what they need for the morning and then still have an hour of cleaning to do, these dudes just have to wait to see our faces walk through the door and then they get to crack a beer, all the time in the world to clean up their mess and do what needs to be done.\n\nI love these guy with all my heart, as one of them says, and I agree \"We're all C#$ts\" we all make mistakes and we all do or don't do something that pisses someone else off.\n\nWe also have a daily checklist and temp log for every shift to assure accountability, the other main night guy and I were looking at it last night.....every night time shift is filled out and every temp accounted for, take a wild guess what AM looked like.\n\nThat being said, you have a checklist signed with the initials of who did what. If something wasn't done then you know who didn't do it. Talk to that guy. When I and the other main night guy close together we've been told our closes are beautiful. I even suggested \"Then I'll start checking everyones work.\" AM responded \"You don't have to do that...\" Ok so if it's not my problem why are we talking about it? The more these conversations happen the more irritable I am when they happen and I hate being short with friends. I'm afraid I sound like someone who can't take criticism and don't know how to deal with it. Is it me? I have to ask, do we just suck as a crew or should someone else maybe not be so critical?\n\nI just don't understand being able to complain about things not being done while a literal pile of \"What needs to be done.\" is right over my shoulder staring you in the face and that's not even the first time that's happened. That conversation with the pile of dishes ended 20 minutes later with me doing the dishes and one of the AM guys come into dishpit and says \"Yeah man I'm sorry we didn't do the dishes dude, I really am.\" Ok, why am I doing them? Put your beer down and do these dishes or next time there's something to complain about just keep it to yourself. If you're gonna complain make sure your actually doing what your complaining that others aren't doing. You don't get to not do your job and complain when you think someone else isn't doing theirs.\n\nThere was even a day when there was a pile of AM dishes and I asked the Mid guy, \"They left these dishes?\" and he said \"Yeah, he said not to do them because something about last nights close.\" I would never do something on purpose to spite another crew member because of a mistake they made. Also, you're leaving work undone ON PURPOSE because of something ACCIDENTAL and Lord knows how many times they left things the way they did intentionally. That's never ok. What they didn't know was that we had a guest bartender on the patio and he left things in the dishpit after we clocked out, he didnt know he had to them himself. \n\nLately I have been vocal like \"OK, if you're keeping score I'll start keeping score too. Here's what you did wrong yesterday.\" When PM makes a mistake its \"You guys need to do better, it feels like a personal attack.\" When AM makes a mistake its \"WE, are a team and WE need to improve. WE need a kitchen meeting.\" Not necessarily \"YOU need to do your job better especially if YOU are going to be so critical about everything.\"\n\nThere's a big difference between Mistakes and Patterns. There's a big difference between accidental and on purpose.\n\nYou might ask \"What does the kitchen manager have to say about all of this.\" I will tell you that is whole other story for another time.\n\nIn case you guys see this, I love you, I love working there I just needed to get this out.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kb4r51/same_old_story/", "created_utc": 1745976826.0, "score": 10, "author": "Capnmcquacken", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kb4r51/same_old_story/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Goddamned day crew", "my advice is the next time you get shit you say \"Ok, why am I doing them?

The closest I\u2019ve been able to find hard numbers on is an hourly rate for renting out commercial kitchens (it\u2019s about $25-$30/hour for comparable HCOL cities).\n\nHas anyone successfully hosted pop-ups in their kitchen? We\u2019re not opposed to \u201clong term\u201d pop-ups, featuring the same kitchen for a month or two; and would also like to know more about short term pop-ups, like one night or a weekend.\n\nDo y\u2019all charge them rent? A flat rate? A percentage of their sales? If you go percentage, what\u2019s that percentage? We will mostly be working with people we know, and we DO want to make sure we\u2019re coming to the table with a fair deal for everyone. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kb4adb/renting_out_our_kitchen_popups/", "created_utc": 1745975431.0, "score": 1, "author": "You_Exciting", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kb4adb/renting_out_our_kitchen_popups/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Are they using your space for storage and prep or just showing up and slinging food? If they\u2019re using a lot of your facilities you should probably be charging rent unless them being there really brings a lot of value to your business. If they\u2019re just showing up and slinging food you should work out a percentage of sales. 5, 10, 15, that depends on a lot of other factors. You also need to look in to the health code and insurance liabilities. Letting someone come and serve food can open you up to lawsuits if anyone gets sick."]}

He was pushing, I was guiding in the front and helping lift over the lip. \n\nWELLLLLLL, the lip came up faster than he realized, and he had it tipped forward just a bit too much and the inertia of the (inadequate) transporting containers was enough to slide them forward and tip the wheel barrow cart forward.

I'll never forget Chef's face as he calmly put the (unlit) cigarette back in the pack from his lips and tucked it in his shirt pocket. \"You boys better get this place spotless so I can have a cigarette .. and don't you dare let it go out that door; if it makes it into the bay, it could be a huge fine for the restaurant.\"\n\nHe was ice cold, but calm and collected, and it was my most magnificent fuck up.\n\n\nIt took us like 10 broken down cardboard boxes as makeshift dust pans and the squeegee to get the oil back into the pots, this time after we got it over the lip, and not a drop made it out of the door.\n\nThankfully, we didn't lose our jobs. \"Mistakes happen... Once\" - the wise words of Chef. \n\nThat next Sunday, a shiny brand new shuttle was waiting for us in the dry storage.

I'd try to make 2 or 3 courses small canap\u00e9s or cold starters you can plate in advance and keep the actual cooking on the night to a minimum, maybe one fish course cooked to order, one meat course cooked to order, sorbet course/palate cleanser, dessert, cheese. 6 or 7 courses shouldn't be a bother.

For this placement in the progression, hopefully it leans toward the drier end of the spectrum.   A salad or cheese course would work here.\n3. Next white... again, details matter.  A lighter, more acidic white (ex: Sauv Blanc) would lend itself to a fish course.  A richer, more full bodied white (ex Chardonnay) could also work with fish or a pasta course \n4. Beaujolais (gamay varietal) is similar to pinot noir in weight/body and acidity.  It can be fruitier or earthier but the acidity gives it some nice pairing options.  It pairs well with poultry and game birds.\n5. This will be your meat course.  Ch Musar is a cabernet blend -  full bodied, rich and earthy flavor profile.  Grill/roast/braise beef or even lamb for this one.\n6. Dessert course.  You don't want the food to be sweeter than the wine.  Port, Sherry, Sauternes, etc will all have classic pairings that will be easy to look up once you know which one it is.\n\nAs others have said, be sure to get the tasting notes for each one.

Artichokes should be avoided, they alter one's palate.", "Guest with lots of wine experience here. I just want to say you've lucked out with their list. They're not super fussy wines about food. If they were old Bordeaux lovers, you'd be much more restricted. For the Musar, give them something with rich and dark flavors, a little bit of spice would be fine. The others are likely to play well with whatever yummy thing you come up with. Enjoy.", "Dos: make the portions smaller than you think, six courses is a lot, you don't want people getting overly stuffed or skipping courses\n\nDont: overcomplicate the dishes trying to impress with ambition. 5 components are plenty. 19 will just detract from the pairing.", "Spicy foods are supposed to pair well with Rieslings.\n\nI'd do some sort of dessert with the sparkling white and cheese for the dessert wine.\n\nThe reds I'd stack up against some sort of beef dish, like steak or a braise. Or if you're a glutton for punishment, a wellington\n\nNote, these are purely my tastes. I would also like to point out that this is a major ask. You're being asked to make a six course meal, and that is more of a fine dining thing.", "Chatgpt has you covered", "Salt will be the friend of all the wines.  Riesling if particularly floral would be better for a bolder dish, ie Thai curry/ shawarma.  If you\u2019re making a salad the acidity should be close to wine you pair with.  The dessert wine kind of sucks here, you will kind of have to match sweetnesses. I\u2019ve never had chateau musar, but would steer clear of strong bitterness or very spicy with this pairing.  It will probably be a red meat or grilled course.  In general tomatoes and vinegar aren\u2019t best friends with wines so you have to use your best judgement. If the undisclosed white is delicate than a light seafood or fish.  Beaujolais should be pretty versatile if it\u2019s unoaked.  Sparkling is often paired with petit four as long as they aren\u2019t very sweet", "Easy Peasy, you got this.  I will assume that as a working cook staging and serving for 9 (come on your dad will want to eat too) is not a problem.  But of course KISS. Anything you can prep ahead is a plus.  I do know a very small bit about wine pairings. \n\n1. Think champagne, pretty much anything light.  You got 6 courses so a small appetizer. Something finger friendly might be nice, like a duck eggroll, or a crab rangoon. Springroll? \n\n2. Soup course. For some reason, my mind is going to a squash or pumpkin type soup, but it's summer. Borscht? Gazpacho? maybe a cucumber soup? Maybe a minestrone if the white is hearty enough to handle it. \n\n3. Sounds like time for a palate cleanser.  maybe a sorbet, or a short cheese course.\n\n4. Beaujolais can be light, particularly a nouveau.  I would make this a salad course.  Perhaps a citrus salad?  \n\n5. That's probably your big dog.  I'm  sure you have ideas for a main, but again remember 6 course, so keep it smaller. 3-4 oz tournados wine sauce with a whipped potato?  I'm fond of roasted beets at the moment. \n\n6. Go wild. Everyone will expect a sweet for desert, so I would avoid a sweet desert wine.  If you have to pair with say a sweet port, I would go cheese course, but I like that for desert.", "1. Oysters with cucumber ginger mignonette\n2. Shrimp ala plancha. Thai green curry. Herb salad\n3. Salt and pepper squid. Sweet chili aioli. Pickled radish\n4. Pad Kra pao. Thai basil pork\n5. Penang braised grouper. Bell pepper and green beans\n6. Mango cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e \n\nMy .02", "Here is a quick take.\n\n1. Sparkling with pre-meal appetizers.  Puff pastry bites with a few nice fillings.  Formulaic, but it is a classic for a reason.  Make them like the frozen ones you see at every catering event, but make them actually good.  Good brie, a walnut and a raisin, spinach/feta etc. They can be prepped ahead, then a quick trip to the oven.\n\nButtery pastry is amazing with sparkling. Potato chips are an amazing, and surprising pairing. I am playing on that.\n\n2. Salad. (plated, composed).  Choice of blue cheese or green goddess dressing. Creamy dressing go well with Riesling. No vinaigrettes. Or endive spears stuffed with blue cheese filling and shaved hazelnuts to garnish, if you want to get fancy.  Again, all prepped and plated ahead. Sitting in the refrigerator, take the plastic wrap off to serve.  Riesling and blue cheese are fab together.\n\n3.  Scallops in lemon/thyme butter with a some brunoise veg.  Is Souse Vide an option? Some home Instant pots have a setting for Souse Vide. Over a risotto cake.  The risotto cakes can be made ahead, warmed in the oven.  Scallops in souse vide can hold.  (any mild seafood works here).\n\nWe don't know the white, but presumably it will be something different than the Riesling. Most white go well with shellfish.\n\n4. Mushroom ravioli.  If it Beaujolais Nouveau a lighter creamy sauce.  If it is a village Beaujolais I'd lean to a little heavier sauce to complement the aged wine.  Beaujolais is one of lightest reds, so I like the earthiness of mushrooms to pair.  Black truffle, parmesan and ricotta would be a nice filling too.\n\nA restrained red sauce could work too. Make Marcella Hazan's 4 ingredient red sauce. Use passata instead of canned whole tomatoes. Strain. Use only the strained sauce. Super elegant. You can add a little Wondra flour to thicken since we aren't cooking pasta in the sauce.  Shaved parm and chiffonade basil to garnish.\n\n5. Lamb chops seasoned with Za'atar would be kick ass with that wine. Harissa roasted carrots and root vegetables.   A little Tabouli salad, find an authentic middle eastern recipe, one that is half herbs and uses like a half a cup mint leaves. Taziki sauce (to cool things down), go easy on the Harissa or look for a \"mild\" variety.\n\nChateu Musar is a big, mediterranean red from Lebanon. I am really leaning into the middle eastern flavors here. I prefer bone in chops, but lamb medallions might be a better choice for an elegant, ladies dinner.\n\nFilet, is a safe, if boring option.\n\n6. I am not a dessert guy so you are on your own. The usual split, and this depends in on the wine too, is chocolate or fruit. If it were me, it would be cheese.\n\nMuch of this you should prep ahead of time, either morning of or day before. The appetizer fillings, salad dressing, risotto cakes, the brunoise veg, ravioli filling, even the ravioli can be assembled the day before. Bordelaise sauce should be made ahead.\n\nSmall portions.\n\nPre-prep everything. Cook as little as possible and only for the things that count like the scallops and steaks.  Work out your timeline and make sure it is actionable and reasonable.  Apps are in the fridge on a sheet tray, straight into the oven. Appetizer is served.  Salads come out of the fridge, remove the plastic wrap, let them warm up a bit, give the dressings a shake.  Risotto cakes in the oven, scallops are quick.  Roasted vegetable already prepped in foil, ready to go in the oven. Etc.  There should be no stress emanating from the kitchen. \n\nI am guessing with 6 course, two hours minimum?  That would be a wine every twenty minutes? I assume it is going to be a slow paced dinner.  Make it easy in the kitchen.  Clean up between courses. Leave after dessert with the dishwasher running. \n\nThe only think that screws with me are different ovens cooking times and temperaments. \n\nI like everything I came up with but the sauce for the mushroom ravioli. Maybe the doubt is not knowing the Beaujolais.  There is a huge variation in Beaujolais.  Nouveau is one thing. Fleurie is a very light red redolent of strawberries. An aged Morgon is earthy and deep like good Pinot.  Maybe brown butter and fried sage?\n\nYou can run this up and down the \"fancy spectrum\". I'd make everything from scratch except for the puff pastry, I'd buy that.  You know you and your customer. Want to buy the salad dressing, fine with me. Frozen ravioli (from scratch is so much better though), but I won't think less of you. Jarred sauces have come a long way from Prego. \n\nThat was fun.", "We do quite alot of wine dinners where I work, and a dinner focusing on pairings might feel scary, but it's not as scary as one might think. \n\nDon't overdo it, do simple nice dishes with clean flavours. Classic pairings are usually the classics for a reason.\n\nWe also have some stuff to watch out for; raw onion for example, boiled eggs, raw asparagus, going to sweet or spicy can really mess things up aswell.\n\nI might have gone at it something like this with your list, if I take some things for granted.\n\n1: sparkling white - oysters might be a nice pairing here, feels fancy and very simple to start with, also its easy to make a vinaigrette that makes them pair well with alot of different wines. \n\n2: white riesling, germany - super versatile grape variety that, especially from Germany, might vary ALOT in sweetness. We're hosting a dinner with a riesling producer from Germany next week, and I'll be serving white asparagus with beurre blanc & salmon roe to go with a little more full bodied dry white riesling. If it's a bit sweeter riesling you could look to some Asian flavours aswell, add a touch of heat. If it's a really crisp one you might look towards something like a ceviche, sashimi etc.\n\n3: unknown white, hard to say when it's unknown, but the list of wine feels like here we might have maybe a chardonnay (especially since it's listed after the riesling so probably a fuller bodied white at least), which tend to like a bit of fat and more elegant flavours. The asparagus dish would pair well here also, swap the asparagus for lobster or langoustine and you're golden. Other pairings could be stuff like turbot, scallops, mussels, hollandaise and so on. \n\n4: Beaujolais, -as someone said, is close to pinot noir in  pairing and would go well with lighter meats like poultry, chicken, lamb or even some fattier fish. A duck rilette toast with a red onion chutney and cornichons could work here.\n\n4: Chateau Musar - cabernet blend. A classic steak frites would be a banger pairing here- grilled steak, bearnaise, a splash of red wine sauce and fries/roasted potatoes. Maybe a parmesan salad on the side. A tannic wine like a cabernet wants protein and fat to smoothen it out.\n\n5: Dessert wine, -depends on the wine, again, as someone said you don't want the dessert sweeter than the wine. If it's something like a sauternes that's got some freshness to it -Fresh strawberries, a little lime zest, meringue and lightly whipped cream could work and also work as a kind of palate cleanser to finish of the dinner. If the wine is considerably sweeter  you could do something like a french toast with ice cream, maple syrup and almonds. If it's a red variete dessert wine like a recioto you're probably looking towards a hard cheese like parmesan or maybe something with a little chocolate, a tiramisu perhaps?\n\nBest of luck to you! :)", "These are all amazing advice and ideas, i\u2019m already feeling much better about making this happen and doing it well.

It\u2019s a skill green cooks don\u2019t tend to grasp until they\u2019ve been in the weeds a few times.

All i have to go by is a sheet of paper that says \u201cgrease trap\u201d or \u201cextraction filters\u201d Which ain\u2019t much of a help \ud83d\ude44.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the industry 2 years and i fucking hate it, im burnt out, im miserable and just hate the thought of stepping foot in a kitchen. but i know if i dont be a chef i\u2019ll be miserable.\n\nI hate missing out on things because i have to work, I felt so miserable i didn\u2019t want to see anybody on my days off. When i wasnt at work i just wanted to sleep all day and do nothing. It affected my relationship, it affected friendships. It affected my mental health to no end. How do people cope? If i stay in this industry i don\u2019t see myself living past 21. Has anyone got any advice on how to live as a chef because fuck me im struggling right now.\n\nThanks\n\n(This is my OP but i posted it in another subreddit before posting on this one.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k9icd9/advice/", "created_utc": 1745798765.0, "score": 7, "author": "Adhjbrhvd", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k9icd9/advice/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["It sounds like this isn't the industry for you my guy.

When i wasnt at work i just wanted to sleep all day and do nothing. It affected my relationship, it affected friendships. It affected my mental health to no end.\u201d\n\nI recently quit a job after working 3 years as a dishwasher that turned into a prep, cook, and dishwasher position as needed because I would do more than went in my job description to help out and picked up what I could learn on my own. Eventually they ended up expecting all this from me but doing nothing to help me out - no raise, nobody helping me with my increased responsibilities and workload, nothing.\n\nSame to both of these, I\u2019ve said the exact same thing about not realizing how miserable I was until I left and wasted away my time because on my days off I was drained. Dishwashing is generally a low paying, shitty, thankless job in my opinion.\n\nFocus on college if you want to get a degree or certification! It will be much more difficult to do so once you\u2019re years into working and in the industry in my opinion.\n\nAfter leaving I took a break for a few months just focused on college, passing my exams and just living life. I didn\u2019t realise how miserable i was when at work and how much i was missing out on.\n\nThis job was shit, barely making minimum wage for a shit job, it\u2019d come to pay day and you\u2019d remember the hard graft you had the month prior then i\u2019d think \u201cfucking hell is that all i\u2019ve made?\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s really important for you to find a decently run spot where you actually can work with how things are run, otherwise problems will just arise and continue to compound. Is that really worth your quality of life and time spent in an industry that often doesn\u2019t provide health insurance, healthcare, retirement, and has long hours? (Not that it\u2019s worth it in any job if you can find better) It\u2019s not worth your physical and mental health. If you miss kitchens but can\u2019t find a good place, maybe find a place you\u2019re only needed part-time so you don\u2019t have as much commitment or responsibility until you move on.\n\nHopefully the right person will see your eagerness to learn and work hard and be willing to invest in taking you under your wing. Best of luck."]}

Anthony Bourdain became famous and then worked his ass off to maintain a level of fame, to continue being a writer, a creator.  He was an artist,  he was aware of what he was doing and the impact he had on people.  And people like him get bio pics made about them.  He maybe would have been self deprecating about it sure, but it comes with the territory.  He was smart enough to know that.   He also loved film,  so of the film is good it will be triumphant.  If it\u2019s bad, then we can all talk shit,", "I knew him, came up at the same time in the same places as he, even shared a drug dealer with him. One thing I think people lose sight of is that in spite of his persona, Tony was always also a product of downtown NYC and the postmodernist movement from which he, figuratively and literally, was born and in which he evolved. He succeeded as a man, a chef and as an artist in and from that time and place because he was, and had to be, a masterful self-promoter. \n\nWithout seeing a script, I\u2019m not prepared to reject this project and its potential out of hand. As another means of cementing his legacy, there is no reason to think that he would, either", "Maybe the director is keenly aware of the consensus of how Anthony Bourdain would receive this idea. Maybe he is going to subvert the expectation that this is all a cash grab over his grave. \n\n\nIt'll either be transcendental and redefining, or absolute hot garbage. I personally don't envision this going any other way.", "I don't know why you'd try to tell a story the man himself told better other than for a fucking cash grab, which he definitely would have hated.

Hard to believe he'd have anything but contempt for it.", "I don\u2019t totally agree. He sacrificed a lot of himself to give us his art. He did it to raise and support his family. If this movie goes to supporting his family, his daughter specifically, I think he would be all for it. Even if it he hated it. He was a true goat.", "So these comments confuse the shit out of me. A lot of people in these comments act like they know him personally. the truth is we dont fucking know what he would think. He humbled himself a lot but he also had at least *three* shows under his belt about food and the world.\n\nHe was also one of the most influential and all around well liked tv personalities in the 21st century. No shit thered be a biopic about him. Frankly im surprised it hasnt happened sooner since his passing 7 years ago.

I personally think Tony wouldnt mind, hell he probably would wanna write on it, but i guess save ur harsh opinions until you have *actually* seen it", "I was just thinking the other day it would be interesting to see a retrospective of his life and career with some of his industry friends and colleagues.

The library only had the audiobook which is read by Tom. He was very open and honest, even when it didn\u2019t make him look very good. It was fascinating.

She told me, \u201cYou\u2019re working six days a week, 12+ hours a day. If you blink, your son will be all grown up.\u201d Those words hit me harder than anything else ever could.\n\nSo, in late October of last year, I made one of the hardest \u2014 and best \u2014 decisions of my life: I walked away from the career I had poured everything into.\n\nSince then, everything has changed for the better. I\u2019m at baseball and soccer games. I\u2019m helping with homework, sitting in IEP meetings, and getting to be present for all the little (and big) moments. Every evening, I cook dinner and we sit together as a family, sharing stories about school, friends, and life.\n\nCooking at home has become a family affair \u2014 my stepkid is always by my side, helping roll pizza dough, cut veggies, stir soups, fry food, and handle all the mise en place. We make everything from scratch, and we make memories right alongside it.\n\nToday, I received a note from one of their teachers \u2014 a small reminder that the love and time we pour in really matters.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful to my wife for encouraging me to choose my family over my career \u2014 for reminding me that some things can\u2019t wait. I\u2019ll never regret it.\n\nMaybe I didn\u2019t get the Michelin star.\nBut I got something better \u2014 a kid who looks at me and says, \u201cI want to be like you.\u201d", "url": "https://i.redd.it/nyc8nc9ec6xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745671086.0, "score": 658, "author": "renegademk5", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k8bzj3/i_left_my_kitchen_job_of_20_plus_years_for_my/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["i left restaurants to cook in corporate. at the beginning it was hard to adjust to, and i hate all the ass kissing you have to do with these stupid vips i couldn't give a shit about. but being able to see sunlight and hit the gym made my mental health the best its ever been. \n\n  \ncongrats!", "Lads this is the good ending", "First, your story is beautiful, especially the part about cooking with the kids and adopting your nephew.\n\nYou're a mensch, bro. \n\nI have to ask what kind of work are you doing now?", "I left kitchens after 25 years, 15 as executive chef I was just mentally, physically and emotionally burned the fuck out.

(They liked my resume for pastry and wanted me available for the new casino opening). It's all just growing pains, and I've been able to secure the pastry team's place in the casino with a few crowd-pleasing recipes. (The team is just me and one other guy. We have a great rapport.) We're nowhere near work capacity for the two of us, so I'm hoping to get a few more recipes developed and some better marketing for our products.", "I make over six figures doing what I love, with people I care about, and get to make/eat amazing food all day. Some can't hack it, I am sure glad I stuck it out.", "I went from commercial cooking to running a small deli and over the last year have perfected baking some things. It\u2019s very calm.", "Intensity, we\u2019re finalists for serious awards this year and my chef pushes us hard to get better every day. At this early stage in my career, I couldn\u2019t ask for more. Except more money\u2026", "Cause it's all mine!!!", "I wish I could say I loved my job but everything seems overwhelming the last few months.", "I love where i work right now because I make double what I did in the industry and i wfh. (Sorry I'm one of the ones that 86'd myself. I do miss it but I also don't miss the schedule and the public)", "Km, cause the job is super easy, pays pretty well, and I only work about 45 hours a week. The food is boring, but its a big team, and I like teahing people.", "As a line cook i get to creat recipes and go kinda wild. Chef will come in ask us to make a potato salad for an event and I have free reign. I also work 7-3 Monday to Friday it's pretty awesome.", "I get breaks, employee meal, shifty, and the people are alright! Work four day weeks, set schedule. Done before 20:00 every night.\n\nIt has a separate dry storage / prep area. The main kitchen is large, extremely well organized, well-staffed and in a great location. We are the envy of the main drag, and easily pull 80% of food sales!\n\n\n\nThe only place I\u2019ve worked that had better benefits was in a healthcare setting, where they offered cheap insurance, but oml the people were TOXIC", "I make the breakfast buffet food for a hotel. A two man team. One of us cooks bacon and trays pastries, one of us does short order breakfast. It\u2019s simple, I actually enjoy making breakfast food without the rush of brunch. I sometimes get to do catering stuff. We\u2019re attached to the hotel at the local university so sometimes I get tagged in on doing events for the sports teams and occasionally get to go to some football games.", "I love it because I have a whole supermarket as my pantry,I have complete freedom to decide the daily offerings, no management overlook whatsoever, fast paced-the day just flys by. Great schedule, basically a 9-5, never work Sundays or national holidays.", "I wouldn't say that i LOVE it...that's too strong.\nBut my bosses listen to me and respect my exoerience. \nThat right there goes a long long way. \n(Cook for several years in a nursing home. Been working in that same kitchen for about 20 years, now. Recent reshuffling of management.)", "great head chef. all veg grown by us, only working with seasonal produce. great vibes and 4 day work week, i cannot complain one bit", "FINALLY landed a prep position after 30+ years in food service. 7-3, Sunday-Thursday. Good food, local chain, fresh produce. \n\nAll that and they actually appreciate my work and input. \n\n... And tell me so.", "Because I left the industry 2 years ago and haven't looked back\n\nEdit: I now see that my answer was outside the scope of your question but my favorite cook job and longest one was at a hospital and I internalized the ability we had as the kitchen to brighten dark days. Ingredients were set but I studied techniques intensely to do what I could with what I was given and I hang my hat on it proudly.", "I'm a sous at one of the most popular restaurants in Austin, we do 50-70k days regularly. Staff is big but we have a great vibe and genuinely fun people. I adore the food, this is my first job BOH I was usually front before. Started on the line two years ago and became chef in 14 months. It's exciting and fun and interesting and I'm never bored and learning so much. When I leave here it will be to start my own catering business.", "First casino gig, first head of banquets gig. Love my co workers, the environment took a bit to get used to. I avoid the gambling floor at all costs if I can help it, it\u2019s depressing honestly. But the work is great and the team is a bunch of misfits ranging from 20-70 and we have a great time. \n\nFull creative control, we often do one offs for vips so I can still make nice food. Mostly all buffet as we have a small core team of 5, but the perks of a casino are great. If I need spatulas or tongs I just buy them. If I need cambros or food pans, sheet pans we just buy it. Nobody asks why, nobody asks if we can split it into 6 months for finance reasons. \n\nIt\u2019s so rare and I doubt I\u2019ll experience it again after this but I\u2019m embracing it while trying to make the best food we can! Recent pnl meeting the fc for last month trended a bit higher at 30, no questions asked. 30 would have been a hard convo at anywhere I\u2019ve worked in the last ten years.. \n\nGreat post OP. There is a lot of doom and gloom around here which we\u2019ve all experienced. It\u2019s great to read stories of the ones who are enjoying it!"]}
{"title": "Working as a spus chef in a Michelin rated restaurant", "selftext": "After being a head chef in the summer I decided to settle down. I was sending my CV to every office job I could find for 6 months with no success. Eventually I gave up and went back to the kitchen. Found a cozy place with it being rated a Michelin plaque already. Colleagues told me to go for it - why not?\n\nHead chef over there has a birth defected left arm. However, he works the hell out of it. I am a person who learns to respect otgers through the work ethics - and he FUCKING CRUSHES EVERYBODY. I decided to work for him.\n\nThe place - an open kitchen steakhouse with always burning charcoal fire. Order sides seperatelly with tataki or ceviche starters kinda place.\n\nPrep guy - Jacob. A kind of \"my job is to know everything\" kinda guy. I love him. Pity he leaves us in a couple of weeks. Works from 8am to 5pm. In charge of prep, pastry and all sorts of inside politics. \n\nFor the first month I worked with him. I outworked him. Came in earlier, stayed longer, helped though all the rushes. I even outbested him in his section, while he had 4 more years of experience in fine dining than I do.\n\nCold sectiod - Davey. A hard nut to crack. He has experience as a head chef and will go to seaside in couple of weeks. There is a hate-love relationship with us, but he taught me how to work around everyone.\n\nTo be honest, we had our fights on how to conduct this kitchen. Therefore, throught every service I saw him appreciate me more every day. Last service (this Friday) was a revalation when he publicly defended me when I made a mistake. Cool guy after all.\n\nThe other SousChef - Rytis. A fucking cunt. I met him twice or thrice but he became my best friend. We had an outspoken bond of \"make as much prep as you can for the other person\" kind. Today was his Brunch shift and I did as much prep as I could have done for him - from cooking beef cheeks for him, to packing hollandaise sauces seperatelly and preping the bread mix. He's a cunt because he leaves in a week.\n\nWhat I learned so far? Polish delivery services bring your goods quicker if you speak Polish. Lithuanians are very adapt to gendet jokes (also delivery drivers). Orders - everything is too much and something is not enough. That is a difficult part from my last chef gig (also in here). \nSome of our recipes are stolen from local niche sushi places. Nevertheless, I have no originality myself so I can't be mad. This is a second place with that much technicality I have seen. But it's the easiest money I ever gained. I am perpetually tired, but I am happy. \n\nI am saving for an engagement ring and a new car, considering we just bought our first apartment. Things are going well. Eill notify if anything changes.\nLove you guys and have a good service!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k8qhv4/working_as_a_spus_chef_in_a_michelin_rated/", "created_utc": 1745711068.0, "score": 5, "author": "ToddaS8", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k8qhv4/working_as_a_spus_chef_in_a_michelin_rated/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Perhaps it's because you wrote \"spus chef\"?", "Rytis?"]}

Then Thursday night I ended up being cut early and apparently right after that he went all out and had to receive narcan 3 times to bring him back.  Cops and EMS in the store.  They found a good amount of fentanyl on him but the cops didn\u2019t arrest due to a law protecting those in active overdose.

Without high heat, a live fire will just fizzle out. Then you have to feed the fire more logs to burn down into coals as service wears on. So you\u2019ll always have a bit of both flaming logs and hot burning coals at any given moment. Both are useful for achieving excellent results. Coals for more delicate proteins like fish, flames for more intense charring and searing of steaks. I like the flaming logs bc they impart a smokier flavor to the meat which is nice when done well, and sets your meat apart from other places that use gas powered equipment. Of course, be careful not to get that sooty black char on your meat. This tends to take some practice. Personally, I prefer the flaming logs but it is difficult to master cooking over them. A well balanced fire of coals and flaming logs produces the best results.", "I mean it works great for yakitori makes sure skewers don't take to long to cook and gives a nice caramelized layer that would take longer on a coal bed"]}

I had my large meat mallet in my hand as I was collecting my things and I put it to his throat, pushed him away from me, and told him if he touched me again id go to prison and he would go to the hospital if he was lucky.

It ruined her retirement plans and upended her life after 20 years of working for Shell Oil.... (i think this is worth the read)\n\nI was working for Shell Oil in Wyoming making breakfast for 150 oil riggers that ate like 450 normal people. I had put in 20+ hours of overtime because the assistant manager caught a serious drunk driving charge, leaving me all alone for almost a week. For reasons unknown, when he came back to work he decided to scratch out my time card and fill it back in without the overtime hours.\n\nObviously I noticed and immediately called the kitchen manager about it. I asked her over the phone to look at my timecard because there was probably an innocent mistake made during payroll. She said she had it in her hand and the hours added up to exactly 40. I asked her if it looked like my timecard was altered in any way and she said no.\n\nI can't always tell when someone is lying to me, especially over the phone, but this time I knew there was fuckery afoot. I told her I'll be there in 10 minutes to see for myself and she tried to stall me. I wasn't having any of it.\n\nWhen I showed up she was bumbling around in the kitchen trying to act like she was far too busy to let me look at my timecard. I said I would wait, and she said I can see it tomorrow. Nope. I sat there staring at her for over three hours before she couldn't find a single thing left to do. She even cleaned the hood for an hour past her shift in hopes I'd give up lol\n\nAt that point she begrudgingly brought me my timecard which was obviously altered and the new values were obviously not my handwriting. The confrontation really kicked off at that point.\n\nHer response to me calling her out on her lie was to put the 20+ hours on my next paycheck, but I scheduled several days off already, meaning that those hours wouldn't be counted as overtime. This was the only \"solution\" she was offering, and that's when I took it to the next level... actually more like 15-16 levels at once.\n\nMy first instinct was to go over her head but I thought, fuck it, I'm going to the top. I called corporate, talked to 6-7 different receptionists, and actually got one of them to route my call to the VP of Shell Oil. No answer, so I left a message.\n\nI got a call back from this ultra crazy rich guy who was not happy with the situation, or his secretary for that matter, but he made it right very very quickly. He asked me how I want it handled and I told him to fire the assistant manager, double my missed overtime hours, and Ihat I need a hand written apology from the kitchen manager. A couple hours later my manager was on my doorstep with a check in one hand and an apology letter in the other. She had tears streaming down her face asking me to please please please call the VP of Shell back and tell him everything is OK now. I didn't, and I walked.\n\nA week later I found out that the VP decided to demote her, which completely fucked her retirement benefits while busting her salary down to hourly. After 20 years of working her ass off for Shell, and about a year before her planned retirement, she had to move back to Canada because of financial issues.\n\nI think the VP was a bit harsh, but legally he could have done a lot worse to her\n\nFAFO I guess \ud83e\udd37", "Last cooking job I had actually, a summer gig, shithole dive-bar pizza joint type place, attached to a movie theater.

They'd fuck up orders left and right, wrong drops, wrong tables you name it, and then scream at us for it. The male owner, husband of the other, had a habit of really ripping into the seasonal teens they hired, and me being a high school culinary teacher it wasn't really jiving with me. So the last straw, we're in a rush, he's fumbling around the kitchen fucking everything up, starts screaming at this new kid who was in no way at fault, and I just lost it my dudes. Ripped him the new one I'm sure countless others wished they had been able to, then snapped off my apron and launched it at his face full force.

I did have a tumultuous relationship with the owner though, because he always had a really hot temper, and did a lot of yelling and screaming for no real reason. He used to come in to the store like a bat out of hell, running around and being in this huge needless rush just because. \n\nAnyway, he hired this kid who came straight out of culinary school. He was a nice kid, and was eager to learn, but it was clear to me at that point that culinary school doesn't really prepare you for working in a real kitchen or a real bakery. I had to train him in pretty much the exact same way I had to train anyone else. So we were going through training, I showed him how to make pretty much everything we had in our menu from beginning to end when I eventually found out he was making about triple what I was making? Because he went to culinary school? And I was his manager? No. \n\nI called my manager, and without even *attempting* to negotiate or speak to me respectfully about it, the very first thing he said, \"well if you don't like it, there's the door\" \n\nSo I took off my apron, left things in the oven, left my mess, and left on the spot.

Feet hurt more than they ever have (yay hard concrete floors).\n\nKitchen was supposed to close 21:00. The owner rings in an 8-top at 21:08, just starters. Rings in their mains 21:35. Desert 22:05. We told her that we could do that for day one, but obviously never again. She proceeds to do this at least twice a week for a month. Chef just went along with it.\n\nBecause of the huge menu, all three of us in the kitchen have to work 50 hour weeks. At least we got paid overtime though.\n\nWe are close do dead after the first month, so as a 'compromise' she stops ringing in orders after kitchen close. Chef clearly starts to resort to using cocaine to cope.\n\nOne evening the owner can't handle the pressure she created herself anymore, has a breakdown and lashes out agains the young waiting staff. \"DON'T YOU KNOW HOW YOU ARE ALL RUINING MY REPUTATION!?\"\n\nBoth me and my sous-chef wanted to walk out right there, but it was february and we needed the paycheck. We also felt somebody needed to take care of the young waitresses that started crying.\n\nAt the end of february I found my girlfriend of 6 years in bed with my roommate after coming back from a 14 hour shift. Still fell asleep like a rock in that same bed the same night of exhaustion. Luckily my contract ended that month, so I told the owner I didn't want to extend it. However, they offered me a promotion in the form of running the small bistro that was on the estate grounds. I stupidly agreed to extend, hoping the new challenge would keep me distracted from my broken heart.\n\nRestaurant-time is over and we go back to catering, all head waiters had quit by now and the sous-chef got a fat raise out of it. Coked out head chef has now started to actively herass me at work. I finish prep for one item, am about to clean my station and he reminds me to clean my station. Every. Single. Time. He. Sees. Me. Finish. Anything.\n\nWhen I started to talk about the plans for the bistro the owner said that I didn't perform up to standard and I was messy, according to head chef, which meant I didn't hold up my end of the bargain, so no promotion.\n\nThat's when I quit. I broke out in a tirade worthy of a german dictator.\n\nThat's last year, I'm still recovering from the burnout that shit caused me. Luckily I live in a country with amazing weed, decent unemployment benefits and amazing healthcare support. I also finally have all the time in the world to see my friends as much as I want, whenever I have the energy.\n\nYes this is a trauma dump, and yes there were a gazillion spots I should have quit; so let this be a lesson.

Then I came in to find a tub of INACTIVE NUTRITIONAL YEAST on my worktable with a post-it on it from my least favorite of the sous with \"no more excuses! :)\" written on it. \n\nLater that day I made 120 trifles in martini glasses for a banquet. I put them on sheet pans on a rolling rack. The same sous tried to roll the rack down a steep grade and spilled every single one of them onto the floor, smashing most of the glasses in the process.

I was hung over badly, shaking from the pills we took for energy (We called our Sous Nurse Ratchet) and I was just paralyzed. \n\nChef honed in on me, lost his mind, screaming with his dry halitosis breath in my face.  I don't remember exactly what he yelled to me, but when he said \"If you don't want to be here, you can leave.\"\n\nSo I took my knives and notebook down off of the shelf above me and walked out the back door.\n\nBest career move I've made.

On Sundays, we closed an hour earlier, but we were just as busy as we were on a usual day so we basically always had a line until close which made getting pre closing done a real pain. \n\nTo make things worse, the cheap ass gm kept hiring high schoolers. So the issue was I had high schoolers on shift who had to leave basically when we closed, and no time to get the pre closing done.\n\nAnyways, we still managed to get the pre closing done, but it was rough. One of the high schoolers was working on their pre closing, sweeping behind a fridge, and I told them to plug it back in. They told me that the assistant gm told them they could unplug the unit to sweep better. I told them that's a bad idea because if we got busy they weren't going to remember to plug it back in. \n\nAnyways the next day, the assistant manager starts yelling at me when I come in for my shift, because the fridge didn't get plugged back in and I had too much else on my plate to double check it considering I was basically  doing all the closing work by myself on Sundays because the high schoolers had to leave because of labor laws.\n\nThere's more to the story, like how the assistant manager always passed his duties to me, and always took smoke breaks instead of working on his shifts. \n\nBut really I just walked off when they started yelling at me over something that's his fault in the first place, after spending 2+ hours closing the store by myself the night before. \n\nWhat's funny is that they were complaining so much to the staff about having to close on Sundays after I left.

The owner was cheap and the building is owned by a former mayor for the city, so that should have been my first red flag. \n\nI got hired lower than the area standard because I needed the job badly. Walked into the smallest kitchen I've ever seen, maybe 10x12 if I'm being generous, and it looked like cleaning was done with the same dirty rag every single night. \n\nOn my second day the owner pulled me aside and said \"let's keep your pay between you and me alright buddy\" and then tapped me on the shoulder, winked, and went back to drinking at the bar. I later found out it was because he also paid the lead cook the same amount for 70-80 hour weeks and 3x the work. \n\nAfter a month of trying to clean the place up so I wouldn't want to vomit every time I worked, I started missing pay on paychecks (for the 12-18hrs I got) and then the owner became really hard to get ahold of unless he needed me for something. \n\nSo when I went in one Friday to grab my check and start my shift, and my check was only for 6 hours, I walked out of the kitchen and told everyone at the bar how fucking disgusting it was then just fucking left. \n\nThe owner called me many times after that, including to ask me if I wanted to come back????, but I never replied or even tried to continue contact.

After opening the side panel on the dumpster I summoned all my might to lift this thing and as it reached the apex of the lift my strength gave out. It came crashing down on my pinky catching it between the can and the edge of the dumpster. Despite this fact I did manage to tip the can into the dumpster successfully but once that was done I realized I had split my finger open. I could literally see my bone. I was bleeding profusely.

The wife did all the sales and would go off book quite often. We had a menu of what I considered standard fare to choose from, but if a client came in with a request, the wife would sell them on it and type it up.\n\n\nWe would get our sheets a week before so we had some idea of what we needed to order. And this would be the first time we would see any of the items/parties that she had decided to \"hand craft with the client\". And tracking her down to get a description of what she sold was like pulling teeth.\u00a0\n\n\nOne of these times was a party she had sold as\u00a0 traditional Greek wedding. Sauces and olives and tomatoes and spices and flatbreads and spreads and spanakopita and spit roasted lamb. And she was nowhere to be found to help decipher what she had sold them.\u00a0\n\n\nWe dove into the books and did our best to find recipes for this Greek wedding. And I was the one to go on site and take care of everything. Loaded up everything into the mobile kitchen and drove out into the middle of nowhere for this event.\n\n\nAnd it was wild.\n\n\nWe had set up so much stuff for then. I had been roasting the lamb on a spit, getting the buffet layout done, and readying the food. The whole group is having a blast. Singing, dancing, drinking, carousing...it was like watching a movie. They were having a joyous celebration of life and love, and there I was just hoping I didn't fuck up their day.\n\n\nIt was one of the coolest events that I had ever worked. They made sure I was taken care of, inviting me to celebrate with them, and were heavy handed with the Ouzo. We talked and traded stories and had a wonderful time. They complimented me on all the food, said it was perfect. I think they were being generous with the praise, but I knew I had done a credible job with the menu.\n\n\nExcept for the Kreatopoita.\n\n\nWhen I read the recipe and saw that it was basically a meat version of spanakopita, I felt okay with figuring out how to put it together. But cinnamon in the ground meat was something I could not get my head around. But that was what the recipe had called for and I made it as listed. Of course I tasted it when putting together...and it was awful. Like I didn't want to serve it, but I had nothing to redo it with and no time to remake, so I put it on the truck and figured it was better than not having it.\n\n\nWhile chatting with the party after everyone had ate, I checked with the client to make sure everything was okay by them. Again they raved and complimented, even when I specifically asked about the Kreatopita. They were so kind and happy and had drunk so much Ouzo, I chalked it up to drunken politeness. But they paid the bill and hugged me as we parted.\n\n\nAnd I never tried making Kreatopita again.\n\n\nBut, 15ish years later, I found myself in a new place in a new life with a wife and family and my job was being a stay at home dad and several years removed from working in any kitchen but my own.\n\n\nMy wife won an award at work and they were presenting at Disneyland.\u00a0 They paid for our flights and hotel, we just paid for our kids flights and Disney outing. And it was great. Each day we would eat breakfast in the room, pack some lunches to eat, get some snacks through the day, and then find a sit down place to have dinner.\n\n\nOne night we picked a place billed as a Greek/American fusion kitchen. We get seated and quickly order apps and food for the kiddos to keep then occupied and then my wife and I looked at the menu to find something for ourselves.\n\n\nAnd there I see it...Kreatopita. And I have to know. I order it because I have to get some idea of what it was supposed to be, because it could not have been what I had made so many years ago. So I order it and they bring it out.\n\n\nI took one bite and it tasted exactly like the recipe I had made. I took a second bite just to be sure and my stomach turned. I went from ravenously starving after having chased my kiddos through Disney all day to absolutely losing my appetite.\n\n\nMy wife offered some of her food, the leftovers from the apps and the kiddos meals, but I could not force myself to even think about eating. Just absolutely done. Placed my utensils on the dish and set it aside to keep my boyos entertained while my wife enjoyed her meal.\n\n\nWe chatted and had a nice time decompressing and reliving all the days events. My wife finished her meal so I asked for the check. And that is when the server sees that I barely even touched my meal and they go into cover mode, asking me if there was a problem, was there anything wrong with the dish, why had I eaten nothing.\n\n\nI tried to placate them, tried to get them to realize I was not upset in any way, shape, or form. They ask if I want it remade, if I want another dish, anything at all. And I keep trying to tell then it is okay and there is no issue. But they keep on and I finally explain to them the story of the Greek Wedding and the Kreatopita that I had made and that it had always been something I had wondered about and finally had the chance to find out. And that it was perfect and I still could not stand it. 100% my fault, I got exactly what I ordered and had no complaints.\n\n\nAnd they went even more into cover mode, again asking if I wanted a new dish, please let us get you a bottle of something, we are taking it off the bill. I was completely embarrassed and did my best to talk them out of it. They still took it off the bill apologizing profusely no matter how much I assured them it had had been perfect.\n\n\nSo, TLDR.... my meal got sent back (against my request) because it had been exactly as awful tasting as the last time I had eaten that dish.", "Th ox tale gravy wasn't vegetarian", "The Sunnyside eggs yolk was too runny.\u00a0\u00a0", "cobb salad rang in as dairy free sent back due to the hard boiled egg", "Customer wanted their steak medium rare, no pink", "Food sent back because of a hair...

Idiot managers deliver me 30 catering events with 17 minutes notice.  Wife gives me permission to quit on the spot.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCast of Characters:\n\nMe: me \n\nCD: Catering Director\n\nCM: Catering Manager\n\nCA: Catering Assistant\u2014college kid, server turned office helper\n\nOC: Original Chef, retired by CD\n\nNC: New Chef\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI worked in Institutional Catering at the time, for a public university in a major American metropolitan area. Our events ranged from sandwiches and chips (crisps) for 4 to black-tie sports banquet fundraisers for 300 and everything in between.\n\nWhen I was hired as Sous Chef 18+ months earlier, the CD (CM at the time) told me that I was selected because of my extensive background in higher end catering, something that the OC didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with and struggled with (he had taken the position years earlier because he was nearing retirement, and our sunny, subtropical region was attractive to retirees). She informed me that he was retiring soon, and that I would be promoted to his position when that happened.\n\nHe retired within two months, but had accrued eight weeks of vacation that had to be used prior to official retirement, so for eight weeks I had the job FUNCTIONS, but no promotion (authority, hours and money). Job functions that were essential to being the Chef yet restricted to salaried personnel (planning meetings where details of upcoming events were hammered out weeks in advance, for instance) were being handled by our newly minted CM, someone who has worked with our CD previously and transferred in to help her out. His policy was \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you need to know,\u201d a policy as effective in practice as a Kindergarten game of Telephone.  Perhaps this is why, in their wisdom, Corporate required the head of the kitchen to actually have that authority and attend those meetings, ya think?\n\nAt the end of eight weeks, another Chef in the kitchen was leaving too, so Corporate wanted to review a possible reorganization of the kitchen staff while positions were vacant before refilling them\u2026.. another two months.\n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nSix months in, they add another Sous to the kitchen (mine I\u2019m told, when the paperwork finally goes through), and after two more months he admits that they hired him to audition for Chef, but he\u2019s beginning to believe that\u2019s not ever happening, so he bounced.  Now I\u2019m once again the only skilled person left in the kitchen, and they\u2019re obviously never making good on the job offer. For over a year they strung me along, always dangling the prospect of promotion, all the while I\u2019m doing the work of a salaried Chef at the hourly rate of a Sous.\n\nEventually, CD got a call from Corporate informing her that there was a corporate Chef transferring into our area that needed a position, and since they had \u201chad so much trouble finding someone to fill their Catering Chef position\u201d, he was being assigned there. According to CM/CD, they tried to put me there (a year too late) but Corporate overruled them because they needed a spot for incoming Chef.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSimultaneous to the personnel issues, there were three institutional catering companies in our area that vied for the contracts of the two major universities and three sports arenas. Whenever one\u2019s contract was up for renewal, the others would attempt to poach the account away from them. I mention this because we had just finished a year of trying to steal the other university away, and we were now six months into a year of them attempting to steal OUR contract away.\n\nThe competitor that ran the other university had been particularly aggressive this time, and had actually handled 1-2 minor independent events on campus (alumni, so not bound by our contract) and the Catering Office was particularly nervous about these. As a result of this, CD came up with a policy directive designed to stave off the wolves:\n\n*We would never say \u201cNo\u201d.  Ever.*\n\n[here, I pause for the collective groan of you all who know that this NEVER ends well]\n\nAt first, this was a minor inconvenience, with the occasional odd dish requests or last minute quantity changes. But, as time passed, the university staff began to realize the new policy (or our staff was dumb enough to tell them outright) and everything went out the window. Gone were 72-hour deadlines for menu finalization, no more upcharges for increasing party sizes at the last minute and \u201cpop-up\u201d events became the norm instead of the exception.\n\nWe now had clients bringing us photos (not even menus) out of Martha Stewart Living of tiny intimate dinners for four, and expecting us to replicate that for an off-site, plated banquet dinner for 75\u2026..and then changing it to 85 upon arrival.\n\nWe had clients calling to ask if it was \u201cat all possible\u201d to provide a buffet breakfast for 80, tomorrow, only to be met with a banner announcing the \u201c3rd Annual Conference of Whosawhatchits\u201d hanging above our tables the next day. \u201cAnnual\u201d means you\u2019ve been planning this for a YEAR\u2026.\n\nAnyhow, that\u2019s the background story of my work attitude at the time, a hitherto unmentioned yet relevant character in this tale as well.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSo, for six weekends a year, our regular catering duties also included football games.\n\nOur campus included its own stadium for football (both American and the other kind) and for home games we catered the entire stadium on game days\u2014this consisted of 25+ private skybox viewing rooms, press box, and occasionally a coaches\u2019 area. All of these rooms had a three page menu to choose from to fill 16\u2019 of banquet table. This meant that, while the choices were more limited than our usual selections, every room was configured differently and contained differing food combinations. It was essentially 25 small events going off at exactly the same time.\n\n[Anyone with three brain cells rubbing together should realize that\u2019s a very difficult proposition on a good day. But, we know this wasn\u2019t a good day, don\u2019t we\u2026..?]\n\nWe used to have a hard deadline of end of business day on Tuesday for football skybox orders. This was because we needed Wednesday morning to turn 25 separate event orders into a single shopping list\u2014Wednesday orders had to be placed by 3pm, were received on Thursday, prepped Thursday and Friday, cooked Saturday and delivered to the stadium by no later than 6pm Saturday\u2014Game Day. It was a schedule that was tight, but allowed for minor updates, missing ingredients and adequate prep time so that Saturday was JUST a cooking and delivery day.\n\nBut now, because of our \u201cJust don\u2019t say no\u201d policy, football days had become an increasing nightmare all year. We now had skybox orders dribbling in all week long, up to and including Saturday morning. I eventually just guesstimated what we would need based on previous events and placed the Wednesday order. Frequently I was driving to our wholesaler in my own car to pick up items needed after the order was placed, and just as frequently I had to answer \u201cwhy do we have so much XXXXXX left over in the cooler?\u201d after a game.\n\nHowever, on this crisp October week (well, hot humid and muggy actually), this was no ordinary football game.\n\nThis.\nIs.\nHOMECOMING!\n\nHomecoming is a tradition (IDK it\u2019s origins, so I explain for all) where a college holds a week of events attended by current students and alumni celebrating the history of the school. There are dances, homecoming courts (kings and queens crowned), etc. It\u2019s a big deal in collegiate life.  It\u2019s also a week where the typical college football game isn\u2019t played on Saturday like the rest. Homecoming games are Thursday. This means that our usual ordering and preparation schedule runs Monday to Thursday, not Wednesday to Saturday.\n\nWhen I left work the Friday before, I checked on the status of football orders, knowing that none of the people ordering would be on campus over the weekend. We had 6\u2026. out of 25. I pressed the office staff about when we would be getting the rest, because I would have to start working on them when I walked in on Monday. I was told that the deadline was Friday 5pm, but I also had no faith that any of our clients would be honoring that.\n\nSure enough, Monday morning yields SEVEN BEOs (banquet event orders, the lifeblood of catering) out of an expected 25, so I set off on my usual \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d process. Three days and several trips to the wholesaler later, all the prep is done, most of the event orders are in my possession and prep is all but completed. Thursday morning comes, and we embark on the task of firing all the food, assembling it into multiple hot boxes, cold racks, and storage racks (room temp items like chips, bread, etc.) all sorted by room number for easy delivery (if three fully loaded trips of a box van across campus can truly be called \u2018easy\u2019).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAt 2:40pm\u2026.\n\n[but\u2026.. this was eleven years ago. How could you POSSIBLY know exactly what time it was?]\n\nCA walks into the chaos of the kitchen and stands at the end of the counter trying to get my attention. Looking her way, I notice she is holding a stack of BEOs.\n\nMe: \u201cI already have today\u2019s BEOs\u2026.\u201d [gesturing to the 25 sheets taped along my counter where I\u2019m checking off items as they\u2019re completed, sorted, stored and wrapped]\nCA: \u201cThese aren\u2019t today\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\nMe: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have time for next week\u2019s right now. Just put them in my box and I\u2019ll look at them later.\u201d\nCA: [looks panicked] \u201cUmmm\u2026.. they\u2019re not next week\u2019s.\u201d\n\nI peel off my gloves and take the papers from her. The top of the first order shows the event location as Skybox #1\u2026 the next, Skybox #2\u2026. I count the orders\u201430. THIRTY?!? We don\u2019t have that many skyboxes\u2026. The last five are labeled \u201cGreen Room\u201d\u2026.? And they are all dated for Saturday.\n\nAs I mentioned, Homecoming centers around many events, and this particular week included a night of concerts at the football stadium on Saturday. Someone\u2014to this day I don\u2019t know whether that was campus staff or catering staff\u2014decided to sell the skyboxes for the concerts AND agree to provide food for all the bands too\u2026..and they didn\u2019t mention it to the kitchen until 2:40pm on Thursday.\n\nMe: [finally looking up at CA] FIND. ME. CHEF.\n\nUp until now, I\u2019ve not mentioned Chef (NC, the new chef foisted upon us by corporate) because\u2026. Well, he wasn\u2019t present. For any of it. Not the cooking, the preparation, the ordering, ANY of it.\n\nYou see, NC was what we call in the profession \u201cuseless\u201d.\n\nHis idea of being Chef was to have me continue to do all the things I\u2019ve been doing for over a year, and just show up in a nice clean coat at the events and shake people\u2019s hands and take credit for the food. His idea of writing menus was to copy the names of recipes out of cookbooks (not commercial ones, the ones you get at Barnes & Noble) and then promptly forget where he got it, forcing me to write recipes from scratch for all of his \u201capproved menus\u201d. He didn\u2019t know how to order, which was fine since he didn\u2019t DO it either\u2014he delegated that to me. He was also a disciple of CM\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you what you need to know\u201d school, executing it just as flawlessly as CM.\n\nChef entered the kitchen within minutes.\n\n\nNC: \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nMe: [handing NC Saturday BEOs] \u201cHave you seen THESE?\u201d\nNC: \u201cYes, I know about them.\u201d\nMe: \u201cHave they been ordered already?\u201d\nNC: \u201cWell, no. You can do that\u2026.\u201d\nMe: \u201c\u2026.WHEN? Order cutoff is in [glances at the clock] SEVENTEEN MINUTES!!!\u201d\nNC: \u201cYou can order them tomorrow, right?\u201d\nMe: [fighting off an aneurysm] \u201cTomorrow\u2019s orders arrive MONDAY. These are for Saturday\u2026..\u201d\nNC: \u201cOh\u2026\u2026. Well, go do them now.\u201d\nMe: [looks around at the chaos happening trying to get food out the door]. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve got this?\u201d\nNC: \u201cYou\u2019ve already given everyone instructions, right? I can watch it til you get back.\u201d\nMe: [starting out the door, riffling through the orders]. \u201cChef, this order\u2026.. no, ALL the green room orders don\u2019t have menus. Two just say \u201csandwiches\u201d without any specificity of filling or bread. Two are hot food buffets that just say, \u201ctwo entrees, two sides\u201d.\u201d\nNC: [huffs]. \u201cJust feed those two the same thing. It\u2019s not that hard\u2026..\u201d\nMe: \u201cExcept that one green room has multiple ALLERGIES listed and this one is VEGAN!!!\u201d\nNC: [waves dismissively]. \u201cJust get it done.\u201d\n\n\nI walk (storm? probably) out of the kitchen and into the Catering Office to use the computer.

Between that and whatever we have left from today\u2019s football, I hope we\u2019ll have what we need.\n\nI walk back to the kitchen where NC is watching people work.

Good one.\u201d\n\nAfter I fixed the three things that had been done wrong under NC\u2019s watchful eye, I wrangled my cats back into order and got everything finalized. Boxes full. Racks sorted. Trucks loaded. And away we went.\n\nThe entire time I was setting up the rooms at the stadium, my phone is chiming with texts from my wife\u2014job postings that she had found online [did I mention how much I love this woman?]. At 6pm, the entire setup is done\u2014all of the food in place, backups stashed, front of the house is now in charge and my work is done.\n\nI walked back to the kitchen and up to Chef.

I enjoy cooking for family again and I havent eaten over a garbage can and I sleep regularly", "I'm kind of echoing what everyone else has said. Overall, it has been much better.\n\nThe transitional year or so was brutal. I got the job in a big part because of the level of food I had worked at. I really sold the \"every plate is as perfect as we can make it\" my ability to see and deal with a 20-man team preparing an ungodly amount of food efficiently. \n\nYour boss, their boss, and everyone up the chain loves to hear the \"How we do something is how we do everything.\" \"We move quickly and we are done when we are done\" and all of those things that are kind of required to be a good chef. But the people that work for you and your coworkers. They hate that stuff. It took me 8 months to stop micromanaging people, and really learning right time and place for a 1-1.\n\nAnd then there was the drop in workload. I was working 65-75 hour weeks, to I'm working 32 and on a hard week I was doing 40. The reduction in intensity to me felt insane. Like I was watching paint dry.\n\nThrough many many therapy sessions and a lot of focused work on my part (shout out out to the spare time at work) I was able to really let out all the pressure and keep it reasonable.", "Personally, I'm a workaholic.

I left the industry because I had my first kid and in the first few months, I knew this wasn't a sustainable life for me being present and being the best father I could be. Being forced to work on father's day after doing everything in my power to not work that day was the final straw. I got out a month later and life has been amazing. I do miss the kitchen life some days but I know it would never work with where I am in my life now.", "I have been in the industry since 1982. I've owned my own restaurant for 18 years now.

I completely understand about the 24/7 thinking of the business, but that is what it takes. Even on days off, I am shopping and looking for the restaurant", "Honestly, I'm still in the process. Had a long, successful career but found I lost passion. I've certified in a few other professions most recently truck diving regionally. Gave it a 2 year shot, but it's just not for me. I'm still figuring it out, and fuckit I'll drive Uber in between. I'm thinking of a pilot license next though.", "I work in banking now, when I look back at my days as a cook it\u2019s wild seeing how much of my quality of life was taken away from me working in a kitchen. \n\nHaving a regular Monday-Friday schedule where I have time to enjoy my life. I went from dreading summer and weekends because that meant I\u2019d be slammed to looking forward to warm weather and getting to spend my weekends with family and friends. \n\nIt sounds weird but to this day I still get an odd feeling of guilt on holidays and Friday/Saturday nights when I get to enjoy them now instead of having to bust my ass on them. For example I got that feeling on Easter last week when I got to spend it with family instead of doing a 400 cover brunch like I used to.

As kitchens do, we had pretty high turnover, and we were also pretty high a lot of the time. Some of us were just plain stupid too. \n\nMy buddy Dimwit and I were mopping up around close. Chef was off that day, and Crypto Bro was second. Crypto was running around checking stations, trying to get us home asap. Someone, I don\u2019t remember who, had been catching up on sauces. We had made something like 50 gallons of a sauce that takes hours to make. Between mixing, cooking, and cooling, it was probably a 4 hour project, costing several hundred to a thousand dollars in ingredients. \n\nObviously the place to leave the cambros full of this sauce while it cooled enough to go in the walk-in was on the floor. Uncovered, not elevated in any kind of way. Simply separated from the tile by 3-5mm of clear plastic, and a prayer. \n\nI remember turning over my left shoulder to find Dimwit standing with the mop in two hands, parallel to the floor. The business end was hanging over the uncovered cambros, and I watched as the ripples of mop water on the surface of the sauce slowly spread. I yelled, pointed, and as he looked over and realized what he\u2019d done, he jerked the mop back, flinging more dirty mop water into the cambros full of fresh sauce. \n\nCrypto, may he be damned to hell, saw this and let out the sigh of someone who has seen too many kids fuck up this kitchen. He then took a small cup, took a couple of scoops of sauce out of the cambro, and put that shit in the walk in. \n\nI, to my everlasting shame, did not do enough.

We got a couple new guys that actually had good potential and slowly we were raising the bar. \n\nI had asked for a raise at 6 months in, and was denied. \n\nAt 8 months I asked again, because we were running a skeleton crew and I was doing the work of at least two people, working 6 days a week. \n\nWe recently got a new guy, I trained him, and was happy with how fast he was learning and gaining even more confidence in our new team I felt I was playing a big role in forging. \n\nI learned that he asked for a raise shortly after being hired because he realized how much work it was, and was approved.

So I asked if they would consider $19. She told me that they couldn\u2019t do that. This isn\u2019t a mom and pop shop, this is a large company, and our volume absolutely can support this. \n\nAfter her giving me the run around, and explaining why it wasn\u2019t going to happen, I told her that that was unfortunate, stood up, shook her hand, wished them luck, and walked back to the kitchen. \n\nI had told chef that I was going to ask for a raise on Friday and he agreed with my move, acknowledging the hard work I put in. So I went to tell him sorry, but it was denied so I am walking. \n\nI felt like it was a slap in the face to not raise me even .50c in the year I had been there considering all the extra bullshit that came along with the job, and when I learned that the new guy got a bump and I hadn\u2019t received one it was indicative of their disrespect for my efforts and I had to walk on principle.

We were a tight, hardworking team with most of us having been there at least a couple years. The Kitchen Manager and assistant KM had been there about a decade, and were considered the glue that held us together.\n\nIt was typical for incorrect orders to be placed in the window (expo) and announced to the servers that is was fair game to eat. Sometimes we'd play pranks like making a \"molten cake\" out of used coffee grinds or a \"scoop of ice cream\" made of butter, and laugh as a server unknowingly took a bite. \n\nOne day, the KM went to the grocery store for a few personal purchases, one being canned cat food. Well, our cherished KM and assistant KM thought it would be funny to put some of the cat food on some nachos and give it to the servers. \n\nSure enough, a female server quickly approached and started nibbling away, and as quite a few people were in on the joke, a small crowd started to watch. Eventually, the KM started \"meowing\" at the server. That caught her attention, and she looked around to notice the crowd. Finally someone spilled the beans, and everyone burst into laughter. She went pale, and then her face distorted in anger. She grabbed the nearest steak knife and threw it through the expo window at the KM, and stormed out the restaurant.\n\nShe never came back, threatening to sue. Three days later, the GM was forced to fire the KM and assistant KM.\n\nMoral of the story, don't fuck with peoples food.

Then I'd get you to cook something again simple. I tend not to have a commis in during service least on a busy day.

If they do that just follow it.\n\nGeneral advice ask questions, taste things, clean up and at least offer to wash up any equipment you use. Ask for something to do if you find yourself standing around. \n\nIn a commis I'm more looking for attitude then skills. I can teach someone to be a chef but they have to want it.\n\nAdvice learn the menu as much as you can before going in. Chances are whatever you are doing will involve prepping or cooking for it.

{"title": "This weekend nearly broke me.", "selftext": "So we have been open for about 3 years now. The first year our Good Friday was slow because we were still new and word hadn't gotten around. Last year on GF we did about $5000 in sales. This year we did nearly $7000 in sales. To put that in perspective, a really good Friday would be around $3500-$4000 in sales. \n\n  \nLast night our expo walked out middle of supper rush and just abandoned us. Needless to say by the time we were finally done everyone was exhausted, we were beat down and burned out. My boss said just do the -absolute- min we had to do to get out, as he didn't want to have to pay 1.5X pay just to do cleanup and dishes, and that he would come in early today and do them all. \n\nAfter working a 14 hour shift (Everyone else worked 6-8 hour shifts) I didn't say boo, I was completely and utterly exhausted as literally $5000 of that $7000 sales were fish and chips and I am on fryers. \n\n  \nSo today I woke up and was already tired and ready to be done but stuff had to be done, prepped, cleaned etc. for tonight so I was at work at 10:30 this morning. I was already pissed off at my boss for other BS stuff when he calls me at 11:00 wondering why I was at the restaurant already (I am kitchen manager and put in 2-3x as many hours as everyone else) and I told him I had a TON of stuff to get ready for tonight, etc. He tells me he needs to go to the bulk produce store to get a box of sweet potatoes and then he would be in to help with cleanup. AT THREE THIRTY HE WALKS IN AND ASKS WHY THE KITCHEN IS STILL A DISASTER!!!!!!!\n\n  \nOn top of that we had a PVC pipe break in the basement leading to a bunch of water pouring directly onto the hot water tank, shorting it out, so no hot water for the night...\n\n  \nI told my boss I am not working till Wednesday as I needed a few days off to rest after a brutal few weeks and I am VERY strongly looking in to a anonymous tip to the health inspector about the lack of hot water and putting out some resumes as, to be blunt, my boss cannot afford to pay me what I am worth.

Meat/fish and saut\u00e9ed veggies is safe for most people. \n\nYou could argue that it\u2019s simply too big of a liability  to serve someone that has a long list of severe allergies, and you\u2019d certainly have a point. The way it plays out is just never really that simple though.\n\nSay I have a table of four people that rarely go out. They do not know restaurant etiquette, and they don\u2019t know how much of a pain allergies are for us. Say they are a celebrating a special occasion like a birthday, and they made this reservation a month ago. One of them has numerous severe allergies, that will require heavy modification. If we say no to this person, I have now ruined this occasion for not just that person, but also the 3 other people in the party who have done nothing wrong. It\u2019s a nightmare. It\u2019s hard to describe just how awkward that moment is. I would rather serve the allergic person a simple plate of crudite than to say \u201cno\u201d, if that\u2019s what it took. To them, the most important part is just being there. Ultimately, we work in hospitality, and that means being hospitable even if we don\u2019t want to. I will gladly put myself in the weeds to try and figure out what the hell we can feed this person, and if that means they have to wash every cutting board in the kitchen and whip up fresh mise en place, then so be it. I\u2019m blessed to work somewhere in which the kitchen team is equally hospitality minded, and is always ready and willing to just figure it out for that person.\n\nThe other thing is, if we say no to that party, that means there are now four people out in the world that are gonna tell all of their friends that we refused them service over some allergies. The ripple effect of that is considerable. So we find a way to serve them, and we put a note of their allergies in their profile in the booking app, as well as politely asking them to give us advanced notice next time.", "Got written up serving someone at red lobster who said she had a shellfish allergy. She asked me what she should get an I simply said \u201cthe hell out\u201d", "I've been refused service at a restaurant due to a tomato allergy. The owner doesn't wash his pans between orders just does a quick wipe. So, good to know and we won't be going there.", "People with REAL food allergies call ahead or just deal with what's on the menu. You should always say no to selfish assholes who only want gluten free or whatever because it's trendy. There will always be a genuinely allergic person nearby who will back you up on this. \n I am severely nut allergic, like death-by-walnut severe, and I do NOT make it anyone else's problem. I put a note in the reservation comments and always tell the waitstaff \"I'm not a pu**y, just don't let me accidentally eat a pecan.\" Never had a single problem or reaction eating out. \nI think all restaurants should have big red signs that say \"we don't care about your stupid food sensitivity. Be a grownup and manage your own body.\" I would tip 30% in a place like that.", "I'll do what I can for people with allergies, even its a pain in the ass and I reserve my right to bitch about it.

And had the balls to say that I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about because she orders it all the time!

Either the kid doesn't like eggs or they are terrible parents bringing someone with an allergy to a place that sells mostly eggs. \n\n\nBut I do try my best to keep everything clean and have specific spots for gluten free bread or pancakes, spots I try not to set anything that has any kind of egg, and I try to keep pork items in the same place because we do have a large Muslim client base. All that said if there is ever a time I am not 100% confident I tell the server to talk to the table and make sure that whatever their preference is, it's not something that could actually harm them. And if it is I usually tell them even if we did everything perfectly,  their is no guarantee that every factory, farm, and packing facility didn't make any mistakes.  I've only had one table ever say they changed their mind and wouldn't be eating with us and they were actually super nice they even left a couple bucks for the server even though their bill got comped.", "I give out \"no\"s pretty frequently, but honestly, I kinda get the people who bend over backwards. It's part of the job... kinda. For all our cynicism, we do choose join something called the *service* industry for one reason or another, and we try to be respectful and accommodating to the best of our abilities, because people are just kinda chill like that.

You'll find a lot of people in the food industry that has some wintering tell you about the time management blundered into the cooler snow blind as hell and pissed on the potatoes.\n\nI do think most people will be honest though and give em a no if we genuinely can't meet the expectation, but a lot of us can probably see that we can and at least *try*.

(But still tell the customer it's allergen-free). The allergy disclaimer is on the menu, the customers knew what they were getting into... and that's why corporate keeps lawyers on-staff! \n\nI'm shocked my food hasn't killed anyone yet, but to be fair 99% of allergy requests are 100% fake.", "What on earth was going through this woman's head", "Places should have Jimmy.

I did have a lot of go-getters in the kitchen though, and I was blessed with ownership who let me (or were scared enough of me leaving? lol) have a full staff.\n\nMany times I would go sit with a table (usually two tops) of regulars who just really had so many questions or wanted to catch up from the last time they were in, and I\u2019d be with them for 20 minutes or more.\n\nIt all felt very natural to me, but different circumstances could certainly lead to different results.", "I never saw that growing up and we ate out constantly at a lot of fancy places.

Part of my job was getting a little extra PR. We had a very famous woman chef who LOVED talking to the guests and going on TV. We had a blast every time and she had lots of requests for interviews. Eventually she moved out of state to open her own restaurant so we got a new chef who was great but had no PR experience and was nervous about the TV gigs. So we sent him for some TV training and he totally aced it. So here\u2019s my take on this: There are chefs who hate going to the FOH and some who love it as long as they\u2019re not in the weeds. Maybe diners should think about how they would feel if they were interrupted in the middle of their work day but I get that people do like to meet the chef!", "People who ask the chef or owner to visit the table are the worst, it's different if by chance they are walking by and they subtly wave them down.", "I personally really enjoy booking a seat at a chefs table-type dining experience, often solo, so I can watch while I eat and have access to the chef and other kitchen staff to ask my questions and learn about their craft, express my delight at their food, etc.\n\nBut that\u2019s when a restaurant is specifically offering that experience and everyone I\u2019m interfacing with has at least the expectation (if not eagerly signed up for it) that\u2019s part of their job/role for the night.", "I\u2019ve had a Chef come out to see who ordered the fried kidney dish I raved about.

Even then it's basically \"bravo and what should I know about this secret off-menu meal and what can I reasonably share about it that wouldn't be obnoxious to your restaurant?\" Hope that made sense.\n\nEdit: also to clarify, I'm going to be \"asking\" in a \"please relay our compliments\" way via a server, *not* \"we're special come talk\"", "You should start with an assumption that, if you have a reservation or are a familiar face to the host, and you are genuinely friends with the chef and/or owner, they will already know you are here, assuming they are in the house.  If they want to come out and talk to you, and are free to do so given whatever's happening in the kitchen, then they will come say hello without being asked.\n\nIf you want to nudge that along a little or maybe didn't make a res and want to ask in a diplomatic way that conveys sympathy for the situation, you could say something like, \"Please let Jeff know I'm here and would love to say hi if he has a minute.\"  This gives the server the out to say, \"Jeff is very busy in the kitchen but sends his regards / this dessert with his complements / etc.\"\n\nShort of that, you can ask to speak to the chef, but it's treading into more entitled-looking waters, and the devil is in the details.  Saying, \"OMG this is the best thing I've ever eaten; if the chef is available I would love to complement her personally\" is one thing and seems perfectly fine; saying \"Can you please ask Jeff to come out and say hi to me\" is another and seems very entitled to me, especially if you don't know them actually that well.  Like there's some guy in the middle of a shift with food all over his togs that has to decide if he wants to step away for 20 minutes to clean up, come out and talk to you, and then get stuck talking to 3 other people on the way back to the kitchen.\n\nIf your aunt is one of those people who can't differentiate between these scenarios, or who will hold the chef down once they arrive by asking more questions and showing no urgency about being mindful of the scarcity of their time, she has no business asking for the chef.", "Guest: \"i know the owner/chef\"\n\nMe: \"same\"", "Our managers are super friendly to everyone and about 50% of our guests ask to say hello to \u201cJason\u201d or \u201cLyla\u201d.

{"title": "A TL;DR. From the perspective of a Burnt out Chef seeking peace at the end of a career.", "selftext": "Chef Blues. I made it in the industry all the way out to Food and Beverage director as a promotion from GM which was a career path from Chef. I'm past my middle age and just want a cake job to retire with where I can't be bugged basically something I can show up for, know how to do, and get paid. Fuck all to boredom. I need boredom right now even though i still have that itch.\n\nFlash forward, to find the job I wanted to retire with got hired as simply Lead Cook with emphasis on handling Caterings in an institutional environment. M-Thursday 7am to 5 pm is what I work. But I have found and in my 2+ years of this job is ALL the exec turnover. I wanted to get out of the grind and the cutthroat mindsets of some of these chefs who will take an entire team down to save there own asses. That is how institutionalized Chefs operate I suppose, but I have been through like 6 of them in 2 years and they  all behave the same. They ALL micromanage the SHIT out of me. . Yes, Just me. Not anyone else. Just me.\n\nI know why they do it. I know I have more real world experience and I can't seem to willfully be able to turn my chef notch down and NOT make good food when I have the ingredients. That is My job, as Caterer they put me in that position for the sole purpose of giving me a certain degree of culinary autonomy to do the executive caterings. So I do it like I would anywhere else. These Chefs, all 6 that I have been though have always made sly comments like: That looks better than what I could do, or I would get a big complimentary email from a client, or the Area director would come in and see one of my spreads and compliment it.  \nThese Chefs seem to hate that as always after they request me to go \"help\" Dishes, or go Take out trash etc. They all micromanage on a level to where I feel like I gotta ask to pee. I don't know how to dumb down myself to suit the personnel. But I get a sense that every exec assumes I want their job and try to protect it, so I always feel like I'm in a state of getting \"run off\".\n\nHow do I enforce to these chefs without directly telling them \" I don't want your job\"? So they have less to feel a threat by? Surely some of you have been in this situation where you are extremely over qualified for the job you do but are resented on the assumption that I do well because I want their job? They are all about the cutthroat mentality so I think they assume I am as well and am coming to take jobs. I don't know how to tell them without offending them further or making them feel more inadequate. They all seem insecure.

You take what you just said and tell them plainly what you told us. \"Been doing this for too long\" \"perfectionism is second nature after all this time\" \"can't wait to move on\" \"don't need the stress\" After all these years I've noticed there are clear indicators of the Chef who has served his time and wants out. Typically no one messes with them. I'm sure if you start using these sort of comments unprovoked around the new young Chef, they'll get the hint."]}

{"title": "\"Mean girl\" (grown woman!) prep cook- what would you do?", "selftext": "After 22 years with the same company, I started a new job as a catering coordinator, with a small nonprofit.\n\nWe have a prep cook, line cook, lead cook, catering coordinator, cafe/catering mgr and two baristas. The assistant culinary director is above all of us. \n\nI've been there 1.5 months and like it ok but I've run into a \"mean girl clique\", as if I were back in HS. \n\nApparently, the cafe mgr and the prep cook are bff's. In addition to the cafe mgr and the assistant director being friends. I'm also a minority in this kitchen. I'm white. I speak Spanish better than I understand it. I'm about 75% fluent in spoken Spanish. \n\nThe prep cook bullies the line cook and gets away with it. We have a seasonal menu. The spring menu just rolled out Monday and the line cook is still arranging it according to what works for her and the lead cook. The prep cook keeps rearranging it back to how she likes, even though she doesn't do the line. \n\nWhen I saw the walkin, I wondered why all the top shelves were empty. I finally realized it was because everyone who works there is short and can't reach. There's lots of space that isn't being used up top. It could be organized better, but if I did organize it, with permission, I'm sure the prep cook would probably move everything back. \n\nTwo days ago I freed up a rack for catering orders/prep. I noticed someone (prep cook) has moved everything back onto my shelf. This has happened twice. \n\nYesterday I cut perfect squares of melons and pineapple, picked grapes, and went through an entire case of strawbs to find the smallest ones and removed the stems. These are for fruit skewers. I stored the strawbs in their own pan, dated and labeled it catering. I left everything else in another pan, dated and labeled it as catering. \n\nToday I came into the walkin looking for my fruit. The prep cook was in there with me. I asked if she used it. And she looked like a deer in headlights! She tried to tell me that it wasn't labeled. I called her out on it. Then she tried to tell me there were cut berries in it and I can't cut berries the day before. I let her know the berries were in another pan. Then I told her she needed to cut me new fruit into perfect squares. She said ok. Then I noticed my rack was full of shit again! I asked her why she keeps moving things back to my rack? Am I not allowed to have a single rack in the walkin? So she started moving everything back and clearing up my space. \n\nThe entire conversation was in Spanish and was also in front of the cafe mgr, who she has known for 14 years. \n\nLater on, I went back in the walkin and noticed the plastic on my berries was removed and replaced with plastic without a label or date (this place has GOT to be paying off the health dept...no one dates anything!) WHY? I labeled and dated it catering. \n\nWhat would you do? I'm borderline ready to be petty. This woman wants to fuck around and find out or something! Moving forward, I plan on storing prep on the top shelves so she can't even see what it is. But shit, it's slow enough for the cafe that this grown ass 56 year old woman has time for games! But catering isn't slow. I don't have time for this.

They worked through the POS exactly like everyone elses loyalty cards that gave 1c back for every $1 spent, but each week when he did payroll the owner would load $2 per hour worked on everyones cards.  \n\nSo no free food your first week, after that you just ring in and pay for your meal but an 8-hour shift gives you $16 to pay for said meal. You want a steak or something you can pay a bit extra of your own money. If you bring a packed lunch you can use it for drinks after work.

Something everyone wants to eat. You can use this to motivate your cooks\n\n\n2 they can order off the menu. Just put in a staff meal button. Then make sure they use it correctly. If you have high value items, or, low margin items, they arent allowed them. You can program POS systems so each staff only gets one a day.\n\n\nThose are the easiest things to do. And easiest is going to be best here because you are trying to save money, not create a bunch of new admin that no one is going to be happy with.\n\n\nYou could even do 1 and 2. And if nobody eats the family meal, you use that to tell your cooks to get better because this is their chance to show you they are good at their job, and what they are showing you is that nobody wants to eat their food.\u00a0\n\n\nAnywhere I have ever worked that did not do either of these things were either super strict and no fun to work at, or, had staff taking whatever they wanted anyway, just better hidden.

An ap\u00e9ritif before I made my long suffering bartender party to the crimes I planned to commit. \n\nThe crimes of which were simple to commit. A malort martini: \u201c(long pause, a stare gauging the soundness of my soul) \u2026dirty?\u201d, \u201cobviously\u201d then a trip to the glassware rack. It\u2019s possible this is one of a short grip of times any fool has ordered a martini in the history of the shop, so unsurprisingly the search turns fruitless and we settle on a short goblet for the deed. \n\nWhat I expected in that puss-yellow gimlet of vermouth, malort, and olive juice was the distillated flavor of the slow death of hopes and dreams a man consigned to the industry incurs, the essence of the sound of birds outside your window post-coke bender and pre-clopen. \n\nWhat I got was surprisingly drinkable. Salt from the olive brine, vermouth (not enough on the first pass) and the botanicals of the malort. It\u2019s\u2026 not a good drink, more drinkable then a clean malort shot by far, actually has merits. 7/10 would drink again.\n\nThe bartenders sensing blood in the water continued, the floodgates now opened. Next a malort Negroni. Sweet vermouth covers a lot of the malort, orange peel pulls weight as well. I\u2019m not actually sure if it\u2019s better than the martini because it obfuscates the malort more 5/10 probably won\u2019t order again. \n\nNext, quick fire after the Negroni I have a malort Ferrari foisted on me. It\u2019s the worst of the bunch. Heavily malort-forward. The last two have been improvements over just having a shot of malort, this is just malort with extra steps.  3/10 do not recommend. \n\nBonus: The fireball manhattan off the ticket.\nJesus Christ it\u2019s worse than the malort. Cinnamon overcomes everything. Manhattan is salted with a dirty bomb of cinnamon. Children play in the streets with a dry dusting of red herb on their coats. It\u2019s real bad don\u2019t do it 1/10\n\nNow oiled up, I take my day of rest before going back into an institutional kitchen down 3 cooks out of 6 after a firing spree with a 2500 some conference. Pray for me. \n\nEdit: I am adding +1 point to the malortini post-scientific endeavor based on the input of a bar patron post experiment stating: \u201cyour ass is fantastic\u201d.

I love finding the worthiness in struggling employees and drawing it out of them. I love teaching young people how to be a worker.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve found my real calling. Turns out running a Waffle House pays double what I made as a social worker, so that\u2019s nice as well.", "So my current job is the first time I've been in management, at least at this level. I ran a kitchen for an assisted living, but that was me and 1 other cook. I've been atmy current job for 4 years, and I've had the privilege to have an amazing GM to learn from. I told her early on that I wanted to promote up, and she took that and ran. It's been an adventure learning and developing myself to meet her demanding expectations, but we have an amazing team and store to show for it.\u00a0\n\n\nTo start, hopefully the training you go through will do this - but you'll want to learn every category. Grill, prep, cashier, whatever the job you need to be able to do it. Maybe not 100% perfectly, but competently enough to get through a day. Never know when there will be a call off and you can't find someone to work.\n\n\nYou won't be in the office much, hopefully. Every staff I've ever worked with responds better to a manager who is in the shit with them busting ass and supporting where needed than they have a manager that stands around drinking coffee and sitting in the office. This isn't to say there won't be times you need to be in there handling your own work - you need your staff to know that you'll be with them to help. Learn to delegate tasks, don't try to do everything yourself because you'll burn out. This is a hard to learn lesson, and you can't do too much of their work because they'll expect you to do it every time. You can go overboard really easy.\n\n\nTo follow up on that, find other staff that want to learn and teach them how to do various jobs. This is part of delegating - teach others how to do parts of your job, like inventory, scheduling, coaching and the line. You'll end up with a well rounded team that can cover for each other in a pinch, and you'll have more time to do more important tasks like training staff, coaching and development. Learn how to delegate tasks, set an expected time to complete the tasks, and follow up on the staff to see how progress is going.\u00a0\n\n\nCultivate your staff, coach, train and develop them into the team you need. Be available, be flexible, but stick to policy and procedure. Don't let them run the asylum, that's YOUR job! Constant communication is key - if there's a schedule change, tell everyone about it. Don't rely on them seeing the schedule, make sure they know and follow up on it.\u00a0\n\n\nI keep a pad of paper and pen with me at all times because if someone asks me a question, or has an availability change, or really anything that needs attention but can't be dealt with immediately, I have something to write it down on. When you get a spare minute go deal with that note. I also keep a calendar style planner to put daily tasks i have to get done, extra cleaning tasks to assign, people I need to talk to, etc. This helps keep you organized and on track to finish your own work while running your store and leading your team\n\n\nYou'll have to learn how to do figure 8's, as we call them. You'll walk the store, looking at everything you can. Guests, staff, prep, food quality, cleaning, building lighting and maintenance, organization. This is also why I keep paper handy, then I can write down any issues that need to be dealt with.\n\n\nThis isn't an exhaustive list, just the main points I can come up with right now. It's taken me quite a while to get where I am, don't expect to be perfect right out of training. Learn, develop and learn more", "At least it's fast food and not a horror story of you inheriting a real kitchen. Your job is put on rails mostly. Keep people happy and keep the business running smoothly. Support any and everywhere, but know when to delegate. Don't let them walk on you. Hold on to your good people and get rid of your bad ones quick. No one in your establishment is getting rich with you. Take care of them in any way possible. Opportunities in the future only takes you so far. A meal for tonight goes further sometimes. You should humble yourself a lil.

I love cooking... but the higher up a chef goes the less you do. Even then... I'll put it to you this way, I'm trying to learn how to trade futures. I would love my own restaurant, but no position in a kitchen pays me enough to live a modest life and save for this investment. I'm marrying my fiance, we have cars, she has student debt. Houses are crazy. This industry is not a lucrative one. We, I, do it for the love of the only artistic thing ai have ever done. I love the Labor, but it's caustic to my life and time. 70hr weeks every week. Years to decades now on end. It draws on you...\n\n I'd love it much more if it was all my own\n\nI live comfortably, and I stack a modest savings, and I invest; but that's all pennies compared to the cost of opening a restaurant. It's a risky business to venture in the restaurant industry. Fast food isn't it.. lemme go ahead and give you thr heads up. Shoot for a chain steak house or something...

Restaurant life blows, as you have probably witnessed.\n\n\nTop comment is right:\n\n\nHone your skills as the best home cook ever. Make a holiday your one-day only pop up restaurant to scratch that itch.\n\n\nFor example, my Easter menu each year is killer. I consider it an exclusive one day only restaurant. My chef brother HATES this, but also I'm the only one he allows in his kitchen when he cooks for a holiday. Every year I have a theme and I usually serve a 7-course meal.\u00a0 This year, the weather will be nice so I'm forgoing that and doing just hors d'ouevres, mains, and dessert, but I'm going all out on a Mexican theme.\u00a0\n\n\nTo me, it's actually better than my professional experience: I get to set my menu, source my ingredients, make my stupid food puns (this year's highlight will be 'tuna y at\u00fan, I am the only one laughing, and thats ok) make some dream dishes, bask in my skills, cook for my brother who seriously deserves a gourmet meal he had no hand in for once, and then the next day, I get to not fucking do it again, not deal with bad management, not deal with SUB this SUB that, and go to sleep before midnight.\u00a0\n\n\nCook for your friends, your family, whatever chance you get. Read books, make yourself fancy meals, keep up studying cooking in your spare time.\u00a0\n\n\nVolunteer to cook at a pantry. Its not haute cuisine, but it's satisfying and a nice way to both give back and to feel like you're in a 'real kitchen'.\u00a0 I cook for the homeless at my church once a month. It's not much, but it scratches an itch.\u00a0\n\n\nLast of all, remember that if you really want it, and you can deal with the hours, the burns, the management, the CUSTOMERS, you'll be far from the first or last person to change careers. If the itch just can't be scratched, maybe one day you'll just back up to that tree and it'll be the right time. I think I will.", "A lot of places need prep cooks, that's what I would look for. You need some skill to prep meat and veg, but not the whole kit. Preps usually work early into the morning shift, so you would still see what's going on for service.

Most important thing is that nothing prepped goes in a fridge unless it is dated. And you keep the walk in organised so raw fish, raw meat, cooked meat/fish dairy etc all have their own shelves and you keep to that religiously.\nAs far as organising my own section's back stock, I generally use mushroom crates with a label for each dish and neatly store everything in there, just find it much easier to know what i have by breaking it down that way.\n\nCleaning, the most important thing is to do it as you go. Do a job, get the section looking like before you started, get rid of everything for previous jobs, sanitise/wipe down, reset and go again, then I'll hot soapy and sanitise literally everything before and after every service, fridges i generally pull out all the trays and change/wipe them out, sanitise them/the fridge at the end of the night.\nAgain it depends on the place but i think a bare minimum in most kitchens is a deep clean once a week...

But anyways, yeah that position can be a bitch to handle solo. I\u2019m sure there are others, but I\u2019m just not fast enough. \n\nI think what nearly caused me to crash out though was a waitress. She rang in a caesar and then stood at the line staring at me as I made it. Then, after WATCHING ME make it to order she said, \u201cThis has been sitting in the (mixing) bowl too long.\u201d Like, THE FUCK IT HAS, you WATCHED ME MAKE IT. She\u2019s also constantly going off about me putting too much dressing in salads, and then always comes back when I make em the way she likes saying she needs an extra on side dressing. Some people ffs. \n\nOh yeah also my window isn\u2019t even an arms length across. It\u2019s tiny. Hot wheel\u2019s window is slightly bigger, but still can\u2019t fit an 8 top\u2019s order all at once. So, that\u2019s fun. \n\nYeah thanks for coming to my ted talk. I\u2019m done with today.

{"title": "Is quitting justified?", "selftext": "For context I started working at an assisted living home a few months back right out of college to make ends meet. I have kitchen experience working at summer camps and bars & whatnot so that wasn\u2019t an issue. \n\nAnyway, it was just the kitchen manager and I for a bit and that was fine. We managed to get everything out for our residents and dishes done within a timely manner. Fast forward a few weeks and he gets canned, no warning whatsoever. From then on it\u2019s been just me in the kitchen with the exception of a temp on my days off.  \n\nI guess I\u2019ve proven myself worthy of running the kitchen by myself to management because now they\u2019re fucking me. I told them as soon as the kitchen manager was fired that I can\u2019t do this job alone, yet here I am, alone. I\u2019ve asked them about hiring another person but they haven\u2019t really shown any effort whatsoever. \n\nI\u2019m doing breakfast, lunch, dinner, two desserts a day, & all the dishes for this place by myself with no help. The only thing I\u2019m not doing is creating the menu, you know who is tho? Some ass hat manager who has no idea how to run a kitchen or how inconvenient some of these meals are.  Half the time we don\u2019t even have the ingredients for the shit they put on there so I\u2019m stuck creating shit on the fly.\n\nNot only that but they find ways to fuck me on the schedule so I don\u2019t get any OT, even tho I\u2019m in that kitchen way before my shift starts and way later than it ends.  The other week they had me on 8 days with no break and I almost walked out on the spot on day 7.  The following week I hear from the temp that management hadn\u2019t contacted anyone from their agency to come in for the rest of April. It\u2019d be just me without a day off for weeks if he hadn\u2019t said something. It\u2019s bad enough that they have me working Easter alone, idk how they thought they could get away with a whole month. \n\nOne last thing to mention, this kitchen is a shit show. Our vent hood hasn\u2019t worked for the past week, our flattop went out two weeks ago, & our door handles keep falling off.  \n\n\nI know it could be a lot worse but idk man. I didn\u2019t go to school for this and I sure as hell didn\u2019t sign up for the ass fucking from management. I had a job interview for something closer to my field of study last week, I\u2019ll hear back on Wednesday.

Put the back ups in the back of your fridge so when you need them, they are there, and you can access the stuff you use more often in the front.

Do this so you don't get backed up and have stuff in the way.\n\n I scan the first 10-14 tickets. If I see a well done protein or similar long cook item, I start it. Then I work the first handful of tickets from longest cook times to shortest cook times. If I have something that is very active and takes my hands and eyes (think that stupid salad you have or the club sandwhich with all that shit you have to stack on it or the finicky thing on saute that always gets fucked) I make it in between the long cook time items and the short cook time items. Then I send it. I scraped the grill and wiped my boards down. Now we are on the next handful.

Three risotto at once, no bueno. the important thing to remember is that your customers are there to spend time with the people they brought with them.

Use a different color if that helps visually. When I have to drop things, I look at the first 5 to 7 tickets depending on their length. Other ones only get things fired if they take considerably more time (ie raw meat). Once things are dropped on the flat top I move it to the right so there is a visual space between the tickets that have and have not been dropped. Try to figure out what visual cues you can give yourself to show where you are. If it takes you a minute more to be organized and clean, that is ok! The quality of the food will show for it. \n\nCommunicate with front of house if there is something they can do to make the tickets easier to read or understand. \n\nI also like to set myself a \"canvas\" to show visually what I am doing.

I need them to pace themselves to me.) \n\nI always do my best to keep the out first items and solo apps working and going out.  Sometimes my fry/pantry person has a lull while I'm working on finishing burgers and steaks and I'll tell them to do the next couple apps or salads.

Group them for as much as you can handle at once, and leave gaps between the groups so you know exactly what you're working on. Always keep them in order (like left to right, left being the oldest ticket). Do not worry about the next wave until the current wave is done, unless you actually have nothing to do, then you can do some simple set up to expedite the next wave such as getting buns/breads plates, etc counted out and ready. And i know this is easier said than done, but try not to panic when the tickets pile up. Any reasonable costumer will know that if it's busy, they'll have a bit of a wait for their food. \n\nOnce you get this down there is a bit more you can do for further efficiency. For instance, if your current wave has low fryer demand, you can skim through future tickets for orders with only fryer items and put them on the current wave. Just be careful not to overload any one station as this will make the wave take too long and you'll have finished dishes getting cold.\n\nAlways helps me to remember that im just serving people food.

{"title": "I might be going back to the kitchen", "selftext": "I guess I should preface this with a little backstory.   \n\nI worked in the kitchen from 2008-2022. I went from dish washer to line cook to a manager-ish role back to line cook to sous chef back to line cook, prep cook then I left in 2022. I was at one place from 2014- 2022. I worked as sous for a little over 2 years.

I drank to feel normal. To feel relief from my constant anxiety and (unknown at the time) CPTSD. It stopped working. It stopped doing what I needed it to do. \n\nSo instead of continuing and getting fired, loosing everything in the process, I went to rehab. I was gone for 2 1/2 months. Rehab for 30 days and a month after that of time off to \u201cgain some stability\u201d at least until I ran out of money. \n\nI went back to my job as a dishwasher at a different location. It was fine, but I wasn\u2019t making enough money and my (still unknown to me) CPTSD was making stability very difficult. Images of being on the line deep in the shit were constant flashing through my head when I was there and sinking feelings of panic accompanied them. \n\nMy dream of becoming a chef was over. I knew I had to leave or risk relapsing. So, I did. I found a really relaxing job as an exterminator. I drive around in a truck by myself going to 10-20 peoples houses and treating them for bugs. Unfortunately, that peaceful job has been plagued with my life having constant barriers. My fianc\u00e9 getting shot, money issues, a small lapse where I drank for a few days and went back to rehab. \n\nIve had a tough time letting go of the feeling that I need to fix my fianc\u00e9\u2019s problems (she\u2019s bipolar 1) and i would put all the pressure of figuring out what\u2019s wrong with me while trying to work while she goes to school, struggling to pay the bills, buy food for us and the 3 pets we have (one of the cats we recused from a soup can on her head in our back yard and sort of adopting her, just had 4 kittens and we\u2019re now making sure they\u2019re safe and trying to find homes for the kittens when they turn 8 weeks and a home for the mother (we can\u2019t afford to keep her). \n\nAfter a heart to heart wife my fianc\u00e9, we both agreed that school was too much for her mentally right now (surviving being shot in the neck and having PTSD having just had a psychotic break and having to go back to the psych ward for 2 weeks will do that to her) and I also need her working full time so we can catch up. \n\nAnyways, yeah, my life can be viewed as a nightmare when you frame it *just* like that. I\u2019ve been in therapy, I\u2019ve had a psych eval, gotten my medication somewhat where I want it. We\u2019re still tweaking my vyvanse and celexa, but I\u2019ve got a good hold on things lately. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m an alcoholic and I stepped back from pursuing my dream job to recover and realized that it\u2019s not something that I can pursue at least for the time being. \n\n\nNow that those of you you are still reading are all caught up; The other day I\u2019m scrolling on indeed and I find a prep cook position offering $17-$22/hr which, where I live, is unheard of. I apply, figuring that it\u2019s probably bullshit. The gm texted me the next day asking me to come in for an interview. \n\nThe interview went pretty good. The position sounds pretty stress free (not having to work on the line is a big one for me) and the $22 I held firm on, and she, looking at my resume, agreed that if they\u2019re offering up to $22/hr that i meet whatever requirements they could possibly have for that pay. She said she\u2019d call me by Monday. I don\u2019t have a great feeling since she asked what the lowest pay I\u2019d accept would be and I said $22 is the lowest. \n\nAnyway, seems pretty chill. It\u2019s a restaurant that\u2019s been in my city for over 30 years and they have great reviews and 5 locations. \n\nIm waiting to hear from her, with the expectation that I\u2019ll get it, but my gut\u2026.. idk what it\u2019s telling me. I feel comfortable where I work in terms of stress management, but the pay and inability to make more money or move up really weighs on me. Idk if this is the right move or if I\u2019m making a huge mistake. \n\nI loved being a sous when the stress was manageable. I loved making specials, solving problems, ordering food trucks, shit I liked doing inventory and scheduling. But just writing this, thinking about the job, my chest feels tight.

The idea is sound, but it doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that most customers who have a problem with the restaurant choose to take it out on the location rather than raising the issue with their server/chef. If a customer is upset with how I made their meal, I want to know why and what I messed up on so I can fix it, get them a good meal, and hopefully not make that same mistake again.

I applaud your eagerness to solve a problem, and I\u2019m not hating on you in the slightest, I just think it\u2019s a situation that needs to be solved by having managers who actively concern themselves with how the guests are doing, rather than trying to over engineer a program in order to do that, you know?

I love spending time with him, we always have such an amazing and special time when we\u2019re in person together and feeling like things are going in a great direction. \n\nThe problem I\u2019ve noticed is communication between us, specifically with texting. As far as attachment styles, I think I am a bit more anxious where he\u2019s a little avoidant. I put affirmation behind texting but only when I\u2019m newly dating someone. I\u2019ve been trying to reframe it to just enjoy when we spend quality time together and not all the texting. He works SO much since the restaurant newly opened, he\u2019s pretty good in his actions which is my favorite thing about him. I see him regularly, and when he\u2019s falling behind with effort and that\u2019s been communicated, he makes time for us and steps up. Outside of work, he has a lot of life stuff going on (his dad recently got diagnosed w cancer)\n\nAt first, we would text every day and it was pretty consistent and then the restaurant opened, I noticed we texted less and then it got better again, it\u2019s been pretty inconsistent in terms of texting giving me anxiety. For example, this week he noticed he hadn\u2019t been texting me as much so he texted me to apologize and tell me that he got sick this week (i got him sick lol) so I really appreciated that because I have said that communication is a big thing for me and really important to me. I responded to his text on Thursday saying that I was off work on Friday if he wanted do something after work and I still haven\u2019t heard back from him. It\u2019s not the first time this has happened, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily happen often.\n\nWhenever we\u2019ve talked about it he\u2019s told me that he\u2019s gets in super work mode and completely forgets to respond and gets distracted & then goes home and passes out.\n\nAnyway, Im wondering how can I navigate this with someone in this field? He has so much going on rn that I feel horrible voicing anything, he very recently found out about his dad\u2019s cancer diagnosis so I\u2019m also trying to allow space and not feel like I\u2019m pushing him. Anyway, I have strong feelings for him and see a serious future between us so I want it to work. All and any advice is welcome!!

The important thing here is that you actually don't care what their reasons are (unless it's actually relevant to where you work/a workflow issue etc in which case work on that too). \n\nLet them feel heard, but don't get involved in an argument. Because what is more important is to then focus on the desired behaviour and what change you need to see from.\n\n \"I hear your reasons, however in this kitchen that's not acceptable behaviour. We expect sous chefs to have full responsibility for their team and their actions, so if something goes wrong, you are ultimately accountable, do you understand?\"\n\nAnd then a couple of additional points you should add:\n- if this is learned behaviour from being in a toxic environment, reassure them that things going wrong won't reflect badly on them (assuming this is true)\n- follow up with some examples of what good looks like. You can tie this to the point above by talking about times when things went wrong and nothing bad happened to the person or it was turned into a learning moment etc or talking about how you'd like to see them respond in future. (If X happens, I expect to see Y from you)\n\nFrom there it's just a point of watching, following up if needed (reinforcement is important! If they change and get better it's good to point it out and tell them they are doing a good job!)

This has always been the trend and I do not see any reason why that trend would change. \n\nGimmicky boutique eateries will be on the cutting edge of pretty much anything and will serve as a test bed for new tech and innovations and corporate places, if they are smart, will learn what works and what doesn\u2019t from them. \n\nCafeterias will be able to better handle bigger and bigger volumes while owners will continue to low man the schedule to keep costs down. \n\nFine dining on up will be insulated by either their or their customers sense of entitlement.\n\nHospitals and nursing home have the most to gain, in my opinion. AI can help patients and residents better understand what their particular diet restrictions are as well as help the kitchen take orders and make suggestions for those restrictive diets. I doubt this will happen as in my experience, the dietary department is more of an afterthought for the board and not a priority.\n\nAll that said and done, I also doubt that the experience that the customer has will change all that much.

{"title": "Just whining about a coworker", "selftext": "\nThis is a massive rant. I genuinely just wanted to shout into the void. If you want to avoid bad vibes and a whiny line cook complaining, scroll on :)\n\n\n\n\n\nI work in a nursing home kitchen. The way the kitchen works is weird. We supply three \"satellites\" which, servers work in and send out the food we make in our main kitichen- we also have a main dining room that fits a single lunch seating and two for dinner. Those are usually 100-150 people a piece over roughly 45 minutes. One position handles making our \"mains\" (protines, soups, and the garnishes for each), plating and any sauces. The other handles altered diets (Purees, mechanicals, chopped, ccho, heart healthy etc) the sides and the backline (a large carte). I've worked in kitchens since I was 14. A while with a catering company my mom ran, nothing serious really. Mostly fast food or a gas station kitchen. \n\n\nAll of this is just background context because I've now spent a year and decent change in this kitchen. I wouldn't call myself incredible what I do. I'm learning a lot, and steadily getting better, but I would really only call myself competent.\n\n\nWe hired someone recently with claimed decades working as a line cook. Listed some proper resturants as some experience, too. They are hands down one of the hardest to work with humans I have ever met. I am so confused as to why, in the comparatively easy-as-shit kitchen i work in am I able to literally run circles around them. Some examples\n\nRegularly cannot get mains or soup done in time for service. Exe chef has to step in and help get things distributed and panned. We have from roughly 1130 to 4 to make two main protines, and a soup. Not enough time for them. \n\nI have to hear them bitch and moan for like 10 minutes when servers ask for something without saying please. Note they regularly don't bother with niceties when asking for things themselves. Personally I am of a mind when we're in the middle of trying to slam all these plates out I don't want you to waste any breath when you need something from me. Tell me what you need, get it, and get back to whatever you need to do. Otherwise yeah, I'll be nice and try to be polite.\n\nThrows little tantrums whenever we run low on something, or they recieve any criticism. Was told a soup that was made was a little to think for the old people (for some reason they want soups almost thicker than gravy) but if it were anywhere else it would be perfect. This ruined their entire day and they loudly and repeatedly blamed our sous for this because he \"didn't come check on them\". Made chili once and during our lineup the servers tasted it and said it wasn't very good. Claimed it was their first time making it. After decades working in foodservice. Chili.\n\nLeaves the kitchen for ~10 minutes at the start of service to \"go to the bathroom\". Every service. Every day.\n\nIs also just sensitive. To be fair, this I think is me just being a dick, but the kitchen I am in regularly talks shit amongst ourselves. Not jn any kind of malicious way. Just the regular banter bullshit. Definitely cannot say a word to them though or you'll get a tantrum.\n\nRegularly forgets things called for when A la carte is ordered. Once, asking three times for an omlette, it took them fifteen minutes to start it. Wasn't even doing anything, either. Just standing around jabbering in my ear about shit I genuinely don't give a fuck about, like places they have worked or weird shit from their life. Will also prioritize prepping dinner sides over making the A la carte orders needed at lunch. \n\nLeaves me with about 2 days in 14 that I can actually look forward to going into work. I love my job, I love the work I do. But fuck has this person spoiled a lot of my joy for where I work.

Depending on where you are in South Florida, if there are few options for veggie diners, you may be able to gain a large number of diners that aren't getting their needs met elsewhere. And it better reflects your goal, which sounds like you really want to welcome people to your place!\n\nGnocchi is easy enough to make vegan (the meat eaters won't know the difference) and you can provide the option of chicken or some other protein/meat sub (both tofu (done well it is amazing) and braised mushrooms would fit nicely with the flavor profile mentioned on your menu).\n\nI echo making the labneh vegan (for all of your dishes) and leaving off chicken skin off the squash to offer a second vegan option, but play around with the addition of a nice vegan protein to this dish, because I think it's lacking otherwise (i.e. I wouldn't order it if it was literally just squash).\n\nI'd also make the broccolini veg/vegan - or at least make it an option (some places willingly can make some of their dishes veg/vegan when asked).\n\nI also think you need a different dessert menu - it feels sort of like your dessert menu is the red-headed stepchild to the main menu. When you offer ice cream as one dessert option, this feels as if it's not really a true dessert (I can get ice cream anywhere). I love donuts a lot, so this sounds good to me, but the title isn't appealing -- it sounds like they are old, stale-ass donuts, and even though your description does explain that it's a fluffy warm donut, first impressions are important here. Also, as much as I love a glazed donut, that's essentially a Krispy Kreme, so it doesn't sound impressive.\n\nI read in the comments that the ratio is off, and I agree. Add a third dessert, I would offer a vegan option, such as a brownie or a cake (both easily done vegan), and reconsider your other two options.
