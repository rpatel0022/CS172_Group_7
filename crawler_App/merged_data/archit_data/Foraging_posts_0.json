I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s always done this and I haven\u2019t noticed (she likes to eat them), but once I did notice I praised her extensively. \n\nMy pup is a dog who responds to praise like an addict.

Now on our walks (three times a day, usually, in our back woods) hunting truffles is ALL she wants to do. I wouldn\u2019t mind except she keeps finding them! I have five white truffles, the largest being golf ball sized, and while I love truffle flavor I don\u2019t want to waste these.

The mycelium is all there in the network, burying the truffles won't do anything besides result in then decomposing. \n\nDon't bother preserve the truffles in oil. Truffle Oil is actually made with a synthetic truffle flavour.\n\nAvoid heating the truffle as well when it's by itself. \n\nThe best way to preserve truffle is in a dairy fat. To the right conditions, the truffle can continue to permeate throughout the fat, eg cheese/butter. \n\nGet some brie or whatever cheese you like. Slice it laterally, thinly add some layers of truffle, wrap back up and put in the fridge. \n\nGet some unsalted butter, soften it, and then use a fine grater to grate the truffle into the butter. Mix it up. You can put some of these blocks of butter in the freezer. This should be the foundation of any truffle cooking. Shaving truffle on top of things really doesn't do anything. It's like shaving herbs on top but not actually putting it in the food. \n\nI also like to add a few slices to a bottle of vodka. The vodka can be topped up year on year.

Do you use the natural yeasts on the berries?", "Inventive airlock", "(edited to add details)\n\nI've got roughly 5 gallon bags of elderberries frozen. They're waiting for my fermenter to be freed up then I will turn them into wine.\n\nFor anyone interested, 4# of Elderberries is enough to make one gallon of wine. Once your berries have been mashed and strained add enough water to the juice to bring it to one gallon in volume. If you're only making a gallon just use a sterilized gallon jug as your fermenter fitted with a #6 rubber bung and bubbler.\n\nAt this point, I always heat the juice to 165-170 F and hold it there for at least 5 minutes. I do this to kill any stray yeasts or bacteria that might spoil the wine. Immediately after pasteurizing the juice I add 1 teaspoon of yeast nutrient, 1 teaspoon of acid blend (both available from Amazon) and 1.6 pounds of sugar and stir it with a sterilized spoon until the sugar is completely dissolved. These measurements are for 1 gallon batches. For a five gallon batch use 5 tsp yeast nutrient, 5 tsp acid blend, and 8 pounds of sugar.\n\nNow I pour the juice into a sterilized fermenter, in my case I use a 6 gallon bucket originally intended for beer making (I always make 5 gallon batches) Put the lid on the bucket and cover the hole in the lid for the bubbler and let it cool overnight. When you know the juice has cooled to room temperature, add the yeast.\n\nMy wife & kids like really high alcohol content so I generally use one packet of Wine Yeast Red Star Premier Classique (Amazon or any decent homebrew shop)\n\nAfter pouring in the packet of yeast I install the bubbler which is half filled with sterilized water in the bubbler hole on the lid and walk away.\n\nIf you've done everything correctly it will start to bubble within 2-24 hours, if it doesn't start bubbling either your yeast is dead (most common problem) or something else is wrong with the juice.\n\nAssuming the juice (wine must) begins to bubble leave it alone until it stops and then let the wine rest for one to two weeks. After a week or two your wine is now ready to bottle. It's fine to drink it right then but if you age it for at least six months the flavor is infinitely better.\n\n#", "The English grape", "Such a nice wholesome post, i like to see it.

If a little bit gets in the food, so long as its white mold it's still basically safe, but you should aim to get rid of the gel and mold as much as possible.\n\nIt IS possible however that the pine cones may have fermented into a soda-like product; if that's the case simply remove the gel/mold and strain the liquid into a bowl, and discard the pine cones. Give it a taste, and if its too strong mix in a simple sugar syrup.

Collect acorns from a tree and remove the outer shells.\n\n2. Dry the acorns in the sun or in a dehydrator until they are hard and dry.\n\n3. Grind the dried acorns into a fine powder using a blender, coffee grinder, or food processor.\n\n4. Sift the ground acorns through a fine mesh sieve to remove any large pieces or debris.\n\n5. The resulting flour is acorn flour, which can be used in a variety of recipes such as bread, pancakes, and cookies.\n\nAcorns from Norway should work fine for making acorn flour. However, it's important to note that acorns can vary in flavor and nutritional content depending on the type of oak tree they come from, as well as the location and climate in which they grow. Some acorns may be bitter and require more processing to remove the bitterness before they can be used in cooking. It's also important to note that acorns contain tannins, which can give them a slightly bitter or astringent taste. Soaking the acorns in water for a few days or boiling them in several changes of water can help remove some of the tannins and improve the flavor of the acorn flour.", "the perfect joke scenario\nFriend: damn these cookies are good.

If this is hemlock, you will have a really bad time.", "Here is an entry on the CDC website about Water Hemlock:\n\n \t \nWater Hemlock Poisoning -- Maine, 1992\nOn October 5, 1992, a 23-year-old man and his 39-year-old brother were foraging for wild ginseng in the midcoastal Maine woods. The younger man collected several plants growing in a swampy area and took three bites from the root of one plant. His brother took one bite of the same root. Within 30 minutes, the younger man vomited and began to have convulsions; they walked out of the woods, and approximately 30 minutes after the younger man became ill, they were able to telephone for emergency rescue services.\n\nWithin 15 minutes of the call, emergency medical personnel arrived and found the younger man unresponsive and cyanotic with mild tachycardia, dilated pupils, and profuse salivation. Severe tonic-clonic seizures occurred and were followed by periods of apnea. He was intubated and transported to a local emergency department. Physicians performed gastric lavage and administered activated charcoal. His cardiac rhythm changed to ventricular fibrillation, and four resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful. He died approximately 3 hours after ingesting the root.\n\nAlthough the older brother was asymptomatic when he arrived at the emergency department, he was treated prophylactically with gastric lavage and administered activated charcoal. He began to have seizures and exhibit delirium 2 hours after eating the root; he was stabilized and transferred to a tertiary-care center for observation. No additional adverse effects were reported.\n\nThe root ingested by the two brothers was identified as water hemlock (Cicuta maculata). In October 1993, postmortem samples of frozen liver tissue, blood, and gastric contents from the man were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography for cicutoxin, a poisonous substance in water hemlock. Cicutoxin, a neurotoxin, was not detected; however, the toxin is labile and may have degraded during storage.\n\nReported by: K Sweeney, MD, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner; KF Gensheimer, MD, State Epidemiologist, Maine Dept of Human Svcs; J Knowlton-Field, Damariscotta, Maine. RA Smith, Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center, Dept of Veterinary Science, Univ of Kentucky, Lexington. Health Studies Br, Div of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, National Center for Environmental Health, CDC.\n\nEditorial Note\nEditorial Note: Based on mortality data files maintained by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, from 1979 through 1988 (the most recent national data available) at least 58 persons in the United States died after ingesting a poisonous plant that was misidentified as an edible fruit or vegetable; inadvertent ingestion of water hemlock, as in the two cases in this report, caused at least five of these deaths. During 1989-1992, the American Association of Poison Control Centers recorded four deaths attributed to ingestion of poisonous plants (1-4). Water hemlock -- also known as beaver poison, children's bane, death-of-man, poison parsnip, and false parsley -- is in the same family as parsley, parsnips, celery, and carrots. It is similar in appearance to parsnips, smells like fresh turnips, and tastes sweet, but it is the most toxic indigenous plant in North America (5).\n\nAlthough cicutoxin is present in all parts of the water hemlock plant, the root contains the highest concentration. Ingestion of a 2-3-cm portion of the root can be fatal in adults (6), and use of toy whistles made from the water hemlock stem has been associated with deaths in children (7). The plant is poisonous at all stages of development and is most toxic in the spring. Poisonings typically result from ingestions; however, cicutoxin also may be absorbed through the skin.\n\nMild toxicity from water hemlock produces nausea, abdominal pain, and epigastric distress within 15-90 minutes. The early gastrointestinal response of vomiting may be somewhat protective as many persons regurgitate the undigested root. Diaphoresis, flushing, and dizziness also have been reported. In severe intoxications, profuse salivation, perspiration, bronchial secretion, and respiratory distress leading to cyanosis develop soon after ingestion. In fatal poisonings, severe seizures occur after the initial symptoms, and death results usually from status epilepticus. The case-fatality rate for poisonings reported from 1900 through 1975 was 30% (8). The last fatality attributed to ingestion of water hemlock in Maine occurred in the early 1970s. No antidotes exist, and treatment is supportive. Complications associated with serious poisonings include rhabdomyolysis with renal failure (transient hematuria, glycosuria, and proteinuria), severe metabolic acidosis, bradycardia, and hypotension (9).\n\nThis report underscores the need for persons who forage for edible wild plants to be aware of and able to recognize poisonous plants in their area. Water hemlock causes most of the fatalities attributed to misidentification of poisonous plants because the plant is lethal in small quantities, resembles edible plants, and is found throughout North America. Health-care providers who know that their patients eat wild plants should caution them about the potential adverse health effects.\n\n\nPlease, for the love of everything dear in this world, DO NOT EAT ANYTHING YOU CANNOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFY WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT.", "That hemlock is helping to prevent erosion, please put it back in the earth.

To prepare the acorns I stored them in a cool dry place to let them dry out over the winter. Then I spent the day cracking and grinding the acorns. Since they were dried, I could easily break the shell with my hand. I took the cornmeal and leached it in changes of cold water every day for about a week. Once leached, I spread the meal on metal trays and let them sit in the oven for a few hours at the lowest setting until dried. Once the acornmeal was dry I ran it through a coffee grinder and sifted it to get acorn flour. I added the flour to my sourdough starter until I was able to have a starter that was fed with only acorn. This didn\u2019t make much of a difference, the loaf ended up pretty dense. \n\nI dug some cattail runners in the late summertime and stripped the starchy cores from the spongy outer layer. I then cut the cores into pieces a little larger than a pencil eraser. These dried out very quickly in the sun after about a day. They were then put in a jar \u2018till winter. I was surprised to see how easy the starch was to extract from the runners. I pounded them in my mortar and pestle, as the fibers separated the starch just fell out and was easily sifted to make a fine powder. \n\nI then mixed salt, cattail starch and acorn flour with some acorn sourdough starter and enough water to make a dough. I didn\u2019t measure, but kept adding flour or water until the dough held together nicely. I let the dough rise a bit overnight and baked at 475 for 30 minutes. \n\nThe result was a dark dense loaf with a crispy crust. It had a very earthy flavor, but was still something that I think a child would like. There was no lingering pond water smell at all from the cattail starch. The addition of a little Irish Kerrygold butter made for a delicious lunch. I\u2019ll definitely make it again, but maybe with a stronger starter, or with dry bread yeast.", "Was it\u2026\u2026 good?", "Also thanks to u/PlowUnited for giving me the idea to do this!", "This is so cool!!", "While it looks kind of dense it also looks like you got it to rise a bit. Looks like your dedication paid off. I\u2019m super impressed and also salivating at the thought of the earthy flavors.", "Mm graveyard acorns.", "Impressive!  I personally probably would have added an egg (free range chicken eggs from my property count right?) and a decent amount of commercial yeast, possibly also a pinch of local sea salt to enhance the flavor. \n\nIf you\u2019re a forager and are even remotely near the sea, salt is definitely not cheating. Next winter when I use a woodstove I plan on evaporating my own as an experiment\u2026it\u2019s certainly simpler than sugaring.\n\nI\u2019ll have to try the cattail starch sometime, there\u2019s more than enough available here.", "Acorn flower makes amazing pancakes", "This is great! I was unable to gather enough acorns this season, but I\u2019ll definitely give this a try next.", "Also kudos on cattails. They have a wonderful history and are the fastest growing starchy edible out there, it is to bad it isn't grown as a staple crop. I love it's cucumber smell at harvest.", "Saving this for later! Thank you!", "This is awesome, I hope to work with yeast and foraged foods to make risen breads this year. I'll follow your acorn processing method next time, thank you for sharing your method!\n\nWhen I tried acorns a few years ago, I only leached 3 days and they were whole shelled acorns, skin still on so they were quite bitter after roasting unfortunately. Hid it in hemp banana bread, which was alright until I got a few crunchies at the end... \ud83e\udd22\n\nGrinding would be much better before leaching, since removing the skin is too labor intensive, that should help the taste a lot. Does the cattail starch help bind the acornmeal together?", " You're practically in My Side of the Mountain over here. Wonderful!", "Fascinating!", "I like it", "Looks really good, and thanks for the super informative thread. I'm kinda hungry now.", "Really cool, mate! That colour is amazing, and also well done for converting your starter over to acorn flour.\n\nWhat's cattail starch like? Does it make a gum/gel at all? The reason I ask, I've been experimenting with non-wheat breads, and the best gluten-substitute I've found so far has been psyillium husk, hydrated in water. It absorbs tons of water and forms a really strong gel in a few seconds. It does a really good job of holding onto the bubbles during proofing and baking of a loaf.\n\nPsyllium comes from the [plantain family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantago) which are pretty widespread around the world. Flaxseed does a similar thing, too. Maybe there are some around you worth investigating?", "That\u2019s amazing.

Fabric and wool fiber need to be treated with a \"mordant\" (usually a solution of water and alum) to hold the color, though. Vinegar acts as a mordant for cotton.\n\n For ink, you may need only the berry juice and a bit of vinegar and salt. To better preserve the ink, a clove or a few drops of wintergreen essential oil should be added to ink jar and keep refrigerated.

Indiscriminately pulling up the soil around these trees can damage the complex michorizal network and damage tree roots. Packing some soil back after is not a fix. As a professional chef I can tell you restaurants often avoid spending money on domestic truffles. Part of the reasoning for this is because if I spend $200/lb on some Oregon truffles I can expect a box of truffles that range wildly in their ripeness. A good fully ripe PNW truffle is an incredible experience and imho can compete with European truffles. A lot of chefs just think domestic truffles suck, largely because they have not been educated. The issue is our harvesting techniques are clumsy in comparison to the use of dogs and pigs as is a much more common practice in Europe. Of course there are different species etc. but US truffles can be incredible! It ends up feeling much more worthwhile to buy less of a higher quality product from Europe.

Porcini stems are very white, these ones have a bit too much colour. I can also see that some of them are staining slightly blue at the base, which porcini do not do. Lastly, the tops also look too orange, whereas porcini start a very pale brown turning darker brown with age."]}

It definitely makes a statement, growing up to eight feet tall on a straight, upright stem. Its large woolly grey leaves grow in attractive rosettes, although it is flowerless for the first year of its biennial life. In the second year, its now-alternate leaves grow more upright to deliver water to the roots. Yellow flowers grow along the stem, starting about three-quarters of the way up, opening a few at a time from the bottom up.\n\nAs with so many plants, mullein, Verbascum thapsis, is a noxious weed to some, while it\u2019s a garden wonder to others. In Alberta, it is classed as noxious, but in Ontario it makes both the weed list and the Ontario wildflowers list. Manitoba is silent on the subject of mullein.\n\nIt has been hybridized in many lovely varieties with large, eye-catching flowers, but few if any of these varieties are hardy here.\n\nThis amazing survivalist plant attracts a great many pollinators but it is also self-pollinating. Thanks to this and its size, one plant can produce up to 150,000 seeds that can remain viable at least 100 years without any external protection.\n\nThere are over 30 common names for mullein, collected over its millennia of practical use in the pharmacopeia. Some of its more colourful handles? Bunny\u2019s ear, flannel-leaf, beggar\u2019s blanket, velvet plant, felt wort for its soft leaves; candlewick, Jupiter\u2019s staff, Aaron\u2019s rod, torches and hag\u2019s taper for its tall, woody stalks, which were often used as torches, easily lit thanks to the fine, volatile oil-filled hairs on its leaves. The Romans dipped the stalks in tallow to keep them burning.\n\nRecorded history dates mullein back to Roman times, but it was doubtless in use long before that. A staple in treating many conditions, mullein was chiefly helpful in managing respiratory illnesses. It is still so used in Germany and is said to relieve coughs and colds by serving as an expectorant. It was even used to treat tuberculosis, where, counterintuitively, its dried leaves were smoked to alleviate consumption coughs. It has been used to treat herpes simplex type one and some anti-influenza strains. Other prescriptions were written for the treatment of everything from hemorrhoids to ear infections, toothaches, migraines \u2014 the list goes on.\n\nPoachers used mullein seeds, said to contain rotenone, to kill fish. Ethanol from the leaves killed mosquito larvae. And first year\u2019s leaves were often placed inside shoes as insulation and to provide cushioning.\n\nVerbascum is a corruption of the word barbascum or barba meaning beard, for its hairy leaves and stalks. The fuzz on these leaves can cause mouth irritation for some people. \n\nCommon figwort (Scrophulariaceae), a family that includes foxglove and penstemon as well as mullein, was used to treat hemorrhoids, also known back then as figs. The plant was also used to treat scrofula, a tubercular infection of cows. \n\nMullein, until very recently, was the chief remedy for tuberculosis in people. It is now being scientifically examined for its beneficial properties in treating the disease.\n\nMullein contains mucilage which helps to soothe membranes and serving as an adhesive in glues. It contains saponins that loosen phlegm and provide foaming agents in soaps.\n\nRemarkable and attention getting as it may be, getting rid of the plant once it is established is not easy. It simply produces so many seeds that once it flowers you are guaranteed to get revisits.\n\nHere are some strategies: 1. Hand pull the plant before it ripens and distributes its seeds. Consider covering the seed head with a plastic bag tied to the stem before disturbing the rest of the plant. Introduce a biological control such as the mullein moth. Plant other invasive plants all around the mullein to choke them out. Of these, I recommend pulling.\n\nDorothy Dobbie is the publisher of Manitoba Gardener magazine.

Some plants are capable of pretty nasty things just through touch alone so WHY in God\u2019s name would anybody just go grabbing at random unknown plants????\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the ones people have already EATEN without knowing what they are (and I mean ones they just found for the first time out in the woods or something, not something their family or friends already eat just fine that they just don\u2019t know the name of).\n\nWhat is so wrong with just taking a photograph of the plant in situ? Why do I continue to see post after post of picked plants from people with not even the slightest clue of what they are? Why is this not a strongly enforced rule here and on the other ID subs? Picking an endangered plant can cause further damage to its population and picking an invasive one can spread it around even more and can devastate an ecosystem. Why can\u2019t people just leave things alone when they don\u2019t know what they are?\n\nUgh this makes me so mad", "Seriously. I see this so often and it\u2019s downright offensive and absolutely disrespectful to the whole function of foraging. Rule number 1 is take what you need and leave what you don\u2019t. How can you possibly need it if you don\u2019t even know what it is? \n\nMaybe the only way to deter this behavior is to downvote into oblivion - because it always seems like a karma grab. Social media has evolved such that there are few better ways to gain \u201cengagement points\u201d on any platform than by being wrong and having people correct you.\n\nEdit to add: maybe you don\u2019t take your phone with you. Just take a leaf, a berry, a twig\u2026 not the whole dang plant. Better yet, take a journal with you and record some actual data. Date, location, recent weather, and press the leaf or better yet, draw what you see. Botanical drawing is quite literally a dying art and as trash as I am at it I have received wonderful feedback just given the fact that the art itself is rarely seen (despite being a superior way to do field identification compared to photographs)", "Great PSA.  There are plenty of apps out there where you could mark your location and come back after you\u2019ve identified the plant or mushroom in question.", "The term I\u2019ve seen for this is the \u201chonorable harvest\u201d and anyone foraging, even if you don\u2019t think you need to leave anything for nature, you should always assume that others might be foraging as well.", "Cosign. This is among the first things that I teach in classes and walks. The most important question isn\u2019t can I eat this but *should* I eat this. \n\nBeyond even impact on the environment, too, it\u2019s important to remember that every organism is just trying to be alive, and reproduce etc. At some point we have to have a basic respect for life, regardless of what Kingdom it comes from. There seems to be a real lack of this, and it\u2019s why I get uncomfortable when people start throwing around the phrase \u2018free food.\u2019 Looking at nature as just another commodity isn\u2019t going to help anything in the long run.", "The guests on todays foraging walk were all handed a leaf from Oenanthe crocata, hemlock water-dropwort to aid in identification. Couple of reasons for doing this. Feeling the shape of the stem and looking at a cross section, plus noting the aroma and closely examining the serrations can really help identify this plant from potential edible look a likes. There are flowers that can be more accurately identified by picking and examining the sepals behind the flower. Picking a couple for study is fine. Picking fungi for identification is also important, we need to see under the cap, note colour changes when cut or bruised and the smell is often useful. For example Amanita citrina has a distinctive smell like cut potatoes, Lepista nuda smells like frozen orange juice, the mushroom needs to be cut so as to get the aroma, there are other fungi where the smell can be key. Plus picking fungi is no different than picking apples. Fungi are the fruiting body, the main body is the mycelium. Picking fungi does not harm the mycelium. Picking a glut hoping the plant/fungi is edible is a waste. Picking one sample for study can often be essential to getting an accurate identification. Without a microscope all a spore print will do is tell you the colour of the spores. Many species of fungi have similar coloured spores. When mycologists take a spore print they do it to study the shape of the spores under a microscope. Spore prints are fun but are rarely needed.", "Great tip! Learning foraging (on your own especially) takes a while. I don't harvest it if I don't have a plan for using it, which means I already know what it is.\n\nMaybe this year is your \"learn what it is and drool over recipe videos\" year, then next year you're ready to harvest a big basket.\n\nForaging is how we can put ourselves in touch with natural limits, like seasonal abundance, how long it takes to harvest and process things, imagining the other creatures we're sharing the resource with... Being patient with the learning process, passing up a potential haul, letting go - these are really important habits of mind.", "If I can't ID something in the field and don't plan to be in the area again for some time, I may gather a small amount of something for further study. Not a \"ridiculous amount\". And if it's a mushroom, and I'm fairly sure about an ID, but need more confirmation, I might take as much as I feel I will be able to personally use, because mushrooms don't get affected by how many are foraged. The majority of their body is mycelium, underground. But I also don't pick ten pounds of mushrooms and then post \"Can I eat this?\" photo.", "we all have these amazing machines in our pockets that have full multi-media creation abilities, even video.  Take a shit load of pictures, put a pin on your gps map so you can come back, take a video of it swaying in the wind, then when you get back home use the miracle that is the internet to connect with a million nerds and figure out what it is growing near you. \n\nLets use some of this horribly dirty technology to preserve nature while we learn.", "As an environmental scientist who works in weed management, and hates the irresponsible treatment of invasive plants in the foraging community, thank you!", "Omg I have this massive cringe feeling when I see posts of things already picked and people asking for help identifying. \n\n Can you imagine if people went hunting and shot animals, then asked for help figuring out what animals?  Or fishing and then asking for help identifying dead fish?  No, you must know the type of animal and fish, including its protected status before you harvest it, and whether you need a license to do so.  Imagine telling the game warden you didn't know it wasn't deer season...", "Someone not too long ago in a different sub dug up a rattlesnake orchid then posted a picture of it in a pot asking what it is", "Depends. Taking a lot of something you can\u2019t ID is dumb, but taking a small sample (and photos) to try to get an ID layer is usually a great idea.", "I'm not a fan of clear-cutters.\n \n\nNear me, giant puffballs grow like crazy.   Most years there are probably 200+ of them in the same area.\n \nI usually take 2 or 3 of them each year.\n\n\nLast year, for the first time,  I went back and someone had come and taken every single one in the area.   hundreds of them.   I don't even now how.  The entire area had been trampled and every puffball taken.  The only couple that were left were growing under brush piles and nearly impossible to reach.\n \nI'm blown away by it.   A single puffball the size of a basketball could feed a family for a week,  what could you do with 100 or more of them?\n\nand now I don't know if they will come back next season the way they have in the past.", "Sounds like common sense", "Perhaps it\u2019s because I focus on fungi, but I will always take a sample size of something that I can\u2019t ID with full certainty, even with the field book in hand for quick reference. With mushrooms, there are things you can\u2019t redo with just a picture, such as check the spore print colour, smell it, cut it and bruise it, all of which are important in getting a fully certain ID some of the time (I\u2019m looking at you, boletes).\n\nWith that said, I agree with care for the environment, common sense, and responsible harvesting and I do see people taking way too much. Especially with ramps in the spring time, where it gets so crazy that people have gone back to the private property locations I do guided walks at to pick even more of them. Some people I even just don\u2019t allow to come if I can tell they are only there to pick 40lbs of ramps\u2026 if they want that, I can sell them my ramps that I harvest in a 7 year cycle for completely sustainability and low damage to the patch.", "Agree. And yet people have shat down my throat every time I\u2019ve mentioned this under a post like those.", "Yes!

{"title": "Big! Lesson learned about sharing foraged food. I will NEVER share again.", "selftext": "I wanted to share my experience so that others can learn from it. To begin, I consider myself a very experienced forager. I started foraging when I was 15, (I\u2019m 50) after I read Tom Browns \u201cThe Tracker\u201d. I\u2019ve accumulated many books on survival and medicinal/edible plants. So when a close friend of mine got extremely sick and blamed the moringa tea she had drank three days prior, I was devastated. \n\nBefore I gave her the tea I had her try just a little, and then we waited until the next day. She was fine so I made all of us a cup. Everyone was fine. She continued to enjoy a cup of tea every couple of days until her illness.\n\nShe got sick very quickly, with sudden and severe abdominal pain. It got so bad we took her to the er. Her abdominal pain was so severe they gave her morphine and then began to do run test after test to find out what was wrong. All of her tests and scans were coming in negative. They couldn\u2019t find anything wrong. All the while she was telling them about the tea she had been drinking. I was confident it wasn\u2019t that, but then the doctors started saying that could be the cause. That her body could be having a reaction to it, like a food allergy. I felt so sick inside. I was beside myself with guilt and shame. \n\nShe was admitted to the hospital and I had the longest night of my life. She called me throughout the night, her symptoms getting worse and every time she mentioned the tea.I have NEVER felt so bad about myself. Even the doctors were saying l could have caused this.\n\nBy noon of the next day they found a blockage in her bowls and did emergency surgery. But for nearly 13 hours I was being blamed for what happened. \n\nI will NEVER share any foraged foods with anyone again. The fear and guilt I felt has had a huge impact on me. I was shaken to the core. I\u2019m so grateful she is recovering and will be okay, but also saddened that she so quickly blamed me for what happened.\n\nI hope this helps others from getting into a similar situation.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foraging/comments/kvuhdx/big_lesson_learned_about_sharing_foraged_food_i/", "created_utc": 1610467582.0, "score": 857, "author": "anntler20", "num_comments": 216, "permalink": "/r/foraging/comments/kvuhdx/big_lesson_learned_about_sharing_foraged_food_i/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["If they found a blockage it had nothing to do with you or the tea and she needs to stop blaming you for her choices.", "Moringha?!

Their rationale being - b-but it would be a waste to leave them out there.", "People can be weird about food they don't understand or is \"different.\"\n\nSo, I used to have what amounted to a small farm. I brought in chips and salsa to work one time, with the salsa made entirely from home grown vegetables -- tomatoes, chilis, cilantro, onions, garlic. I mentioned it was \"from my garden\" when I first set it on the table for everyone to share -- there was a giant bowl of salsa, easily over a gallon, because I had a bumper crop of veggies.\n\nEveryone went nuts over the salsa. People from other departments wandered in, and walked off with little dixie cups of salsa. All good.\n\nAnyway, I'm casually talking to a couple other gardeners at work, and we got to talking about fertilizer. When asked, I mention my preferred fertilizer was goat manure, composted with alfalfa chaff. The other gardeners nodded, one asked if I had extra manure (nope), and it all would have been good if the department Fussy Woman hadn't overheard my tomato-growing secret.\n\nI. Fertilized. My. Tomatoes. With. Goat. Shit.\n\nOMG, Fussy Lady was \"instantly\" sick with food poisoning even though she'd only sampled the salsa a few minutes before (then declared it \"wasn't spicy enough\" after eating a couple chips, and told me Chipotle's was better and mine was \"white people\" salsa, all in the same breath -- she was also white), and she ran gagging very dramatically to the bathroom to barf, and then went home sick. Okay, fine. Fussy Lady was dramatic.\n\nHowever, two other people also \"got sick\" from food poisoning within the next fifteen minutes via the power of suggestion -- both her friends.\n\nAll three later complained to HR, and I was banned from bringing food that \"wasn't from the grocery store\" to work ever again. I could no longer bring in veggies or eggs to share (for free) due to \"liability.\" I had a huge garden and ended up feeding most of my extras to the chickens when I ran out of space in the pantry and hungry friends and neighbors.\n\nI hated that workplace.\n\nAlso, the salsa was cooked the previous evening from freshly harvested veggies (or roasted and frozen chilis), so it was very unlikely to have caused puking level food poisoning fifteen minutes after consumption.\n\nTwenty years later, I ran into a former coworker who mentioned the salsa incident. She asked me for my recipe because she remembered that salsa, and we shared a laugh over the memory of Fussy Lady's dramatics.", "Sounds like someone owes you an apology. Sorry that that happened OP. Glad everyone is ok.", "Even if the tea had caused it, you can't really be blamed for a food reaction that neither of you were aware of ahead of time. Imagine if you made lobster for someone who had never had it before, and they turned out to be allergic to it. No reasonable person could blame you for that.", "So she was actually just full of sh*t", "I honestly thought this was going to end with \u201cand now she\u2019s suing me for medical bills and pain & suffering \u201c. Ugh. I\u2019m so sorry this happened!", "In a way her reaction is understandable because the tea was something new to her diet so in her mind it was the odd man out. Plus, I'm sure she was scared. \n\nYour reaction is also understandable and I think you're making the best choice to no longer share foraged foods. I'm sorry that happened to you and I'm really glad the situation ended on a positive note.", "Sharing foraged foods is tricky. On the one hand it\u2019s a beautiful gift. And I think the more familiar foraged foods can be gifted harmlessly (who doesn\u2019t want a basket of wild berries or a handful of mint??!!!). However, when it comes to less familiar and more exotic foraged items that people might never encounter on their own, I stay very very careful. I admit to myself the \u201crisks\u201d involved, and take responsibility for my own learning and diligence in identifying plants and mushrooms. I\u2019ll never forget the CDC MMWR articles on the multiple California residents who accepted baskets of wild mushrooms from \u201cexperienced\u201d friends and ended up either dying or having their livers replaced. This was just a few years ago, and entire families including infants were impacted. Therefore I avoid introducing most of my friends to unfamiliar things, purely because I don\u2019t want to put them in the position of trusting someone who I might not trust. Is this arrogant? Maybe. I see it as the opposite. Don\u2019t trust me, don\u2019t trust anyone but yourself and your own knowledge of wild foods. That\u2019s the advice I give. Just the other day a friend was walking with me and I jumped off the trail for a handful of chanterelles and they told me of the experienced coworker who had handed them wild mushrooms I didn\u2019t recognize the description of. And I\u2019m a biologist. I think this is tricky territory!", "I'm always surprised how quickly people will accept as a gift or be served foraged items they can't identify themselves. I usually pick at least a hundred pounds of mushrooms each year, but will not eat foraged mushrooms served to me if I can not clearly identify what I am eating. It's not worth even the tiny risk imo.", "Even IF moringa had some sort of negative effect, it is metabolized rather quickly. If whatever she felt happened 3 DAYS after she drank the tea, she was very wrong to blame it on you.", "Sucks you got blamed. Must have been terrifying!!", "First thing I always tell people when they are foraging is that it should not be taken lightly. You must be under the assumption that anything you consume could cause affect or harm. I always only share my foraging with friends that I know are interested in foraging and know the risks. It like swimming at a beach without a lifeguard, at your own risk.", "Everything has a risk in being eaten even shellfish, wild or  farm grown it could cause paralysis or even death you can't blame yourself for such things happening you might've bough green tea and she would have been poisoned I don't think you should hold yourself accountable for such shit happening.", "I can't empathize with this at all. If a consenting adult chooses to ingest something that doesn't sit well with them, it's their responsibility\u2014or at the very least, it's not yours. Beyond that, it sounds like you took all reasonable steps to ensure that they would not have a negative reaction. In my view, there's no reason to feel guilty. If anything, you should be alarmed that your friend's immediate reaction was to assign blame. \n\nThe takeaway from this story is that your friend was quick to blame you for something you didn't do. You should keep sharing forageables, just not with that friend. The benefit of getting people engaged with foraging and nature outweighs a heavily mitigated risk.", "My first thought, given moringa\u2019s stimulative effect on the GI tract, is maybe the moringa \u2018awoke\u2019 the blockage by causing more / accelerated processing through the intestine, which while painful was necessary and may have even been beneficial because it led her to discover the problem and address it! \n\nI am not a doctor but green tea, matcha and moringa all have a big and beneficial effect on my digestion. So maybe it \u2018was\u2019 the tea ... but in a really good way to help her address this problem before it got even more serious without being detected ! (Reddit disclaimer: Just my theory . Not a doc.)\n\nAlso really sorry about how stressful that was ! I think you did the right thing in trying to slowly test her on it and that you sound like a very good friend. I\u2019m sorry she kept thinking it was the tea, but it sounds to me like you were careful and responsible as possible about sharing.", "Sending you good energy!! So sorry that you were blamed so quickly without any apology.

I wouldn't say not to share with your family, but maybe if you move to a new country get to know the mushrooms a bit better before you put them on the plate.

I know in this case it probably wasn't your fault, but I sometimes wonder with some of the ID requests and stuff I see on Reddit how often people are actually poisoning themselves.", "This kind of just shows the double standard people between wild food and domestic food. She could have been allergic or sensitive just as easily to any domestic food. Its probably wise to be cautious about eating anything new.

Was a freak coincidence, she was obviously freaked out and was looking for a answer, people often blame something new or something they dont understand.

This is a short fermentation that only takes 24-48 hours before you can enjoy the soda. It\u2019s fizzy and so refreshing! \n\nFor 1 gallon of soda:\n\n225 g conifer tips (or more)\n250-300 g raw honey\n3 limes, sliced\n3.5 L water (non-chlorinated)\n1/2 cup wild yeast starter (optional)\n\nDirections: \n\n\u2728Clean all equipment you will be using to make the soda. I use lots of soap and hot water.\n\n\u2728With clean hands, place all ingredients in a large container. Add water, honey (or sugar) and mix well. \n\n\u2728Add a wild yeast starter and stir well. Cover the jar to keep little insects out, but loosely enough so fermentation gases can escape. If you don\u2019t have a wild yeast starter, a small amount of champagne yeast is good too\n\n\u2728Let sit 24-48 hours. Stir 2-3 times a day with a clean spoon. After 12-24 hours you should see fermentation bubbles when you open the jar and stir. \n\n\u2728Taste the soda (with a clean straw!) to monitor the sweetness and flavors. Once it\u2019s to your liking, strain the soda with a sieve or cheesecloth and bottle into flip-top bottles. \n\n\u2728Let sit for 8 hours at room temperature to build carbonation. Burp the bottles every 8 hours by opening the bottles. It\u2019s still an active fermentation so pressure builds fast, especially if it\u2019s warmer. \n\n\u2728Once the soda is nice and bubbly, store the bottles in the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation.

They spotted this lovely bundle of leathery earthfans after collecting some white chanterelles and hedgehogs at 2100' elevation. Indeed, I first thought these were a tight bundle of black trumpets huddling together in a microclimate, or perhaps a discolored purple chanterelle (Gomphus clavatus).\n\nThough these are colloquially known as \"blue chanterelles\", they are not a Cantharellus, or \"true\" chanterelle. In fact, they belong to the genus Polyozellus, which used to contain a singular species (P. multiplex). It has since been discovered that there are a variety of species in this genus but the trail begins to get a little cold there.\n\nThey are, of course, edible and good.\n\nThe season has wound down at 2100 feet and most mushrooms have gone to sleep for the year. We found a fair amount of Suillus luteus, or slippery jacks, as well as a saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus). Though we didn't find any porcini, these two are amazing indicator species. There is a very good chance they grow here earlier in the season. There is a lot you can infer from the other mushrooms that grow in an area.\n\nAnother one of our interesting finds was Tricholoma focale, a sister species to the prized matsutake mushroom. We were able to use some of its distinguishing traits to learn about Tricholoma matsutake.\n\nWe also discovered a variety of gorgeous Ramaria and Artomyces, which can be notoriously difficult to identify. We also learned that there are no poisonous white coral fungi, and Clavulina could be consumed in a survival situation.\n\nIt was a true pleasure adventuring with A, D and M today.

{"title": "I made a bunch of spruce gum for holiday gifts. NY z6. (Picea sp.)", "selftext": "After reading about how loggers in the Adirondacks would send boxes of spruce gum home as gifts I decided to give it a try. \n\nI gathered spruce resin from trees while hiking this winter, and stop them all in a clean cloth that I got from an old shirt I was turning into rags.\n\nI tied up a sleeve at both ends and boiled it. The resin melted and filtered through the cloth leaving behind debris. \n\nThen I ladled the floating resin into a pot of cool water, where it cooled down enough for me to form into blobs that I pulled like taffy, and then rolled into sausages. The sausages were cut up and rolled into gumballs. I ended up individually, wrapping each of these in wax paper to stop them from sticking to each other.\n\nThis resulted in what would\u2019ve been the first popular chewing gum in the United States. Apparently it used to be sold at just about every general store. It tastes like chewing a Christmas tree, and it shatters when you start chewing it until it warms up and forms into a blob of gum. The flavor lasts a long time and it makes your breath woodsy fresh. Apparently it can be used several times and people used to store it for chewing later. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m into that, but it\u2019s definitely still spruce resin after you\u2019re done chewing and you can use it to make pitch.\n\nIn 1603 English explorer Martin Pring commented that American spruce resin was no less sweet than frankincense when used as an incense. I was curious if his claim was just an attempt to get funding for another voyage from his patron, so I tossed some of the resin on it oil burner like you would to do with frankincense.

Now, and this is crucial, Neanderthals were by no means some backward cave-people. Quite on the contrary. Their sophistication is incredibly impressive! Our own species is probably older than 300,000 years (see the Moroccan sites), meaning that the difference between us and Cleopatra constitutes just 0.5% of the difference (in years) between us and \"them\".\n\nNow, what does 0.5% even mean? It means, that said distance in years is comparable, mathematically, to a person that reaches the age of 80 and a toddler of 4.\n\n\"Brian\", I'd argue, is an extreme exception in human history. Trial and error was not the norm. Culture and teachings were. If we would, just for a second, allow ourselves to consider that Homo erectus and other species of Homo were, perhaps, able to \"pass on\" their knowledge, then the difference between the toddler and the granny or gramps would amplify even more (and by a lot!).\n\nHomo sapiens might have been around for (roughly) 15,000 generations. If there'd just be an average number of \"groups\" of 1,000 per generation (which is an incredibly low estimate), and each group had only one \"Brian\", then we'd end up with around 15 million possible deathly plants to be ingested. Given that most of humans \"journey\" happened in specific parts of Africa and the Middle East (and partially Central Asia, Europe and South Asia) and that many toxic plants follow certain patterns and \"rules\", we'd have a pretty good chance minimizing the brianization of our social groups.\n\n(I just wanted to say brianization once) \\[Haha!

A later, 13 point, version appeared in FM 3-05.70, of May 2002.\n\n**FM 3-05.70  is no longer active.**  It was prescinded 06/12/2020 - so is now just a historic curiosity, although many veterans will view it with  either fondness or loathing, depending on their learning experiences ...\n\nReturning to the UET.    In FM 3-05.70, the notes, caveats, warnings, about the 13 test point protocols went on for many pages.  It still fails to consider fungi.

It also advised that you are better to recognise edible plants rather than testing for toxins/poisons.  However, it too has been overtaken by new developments in plant toxicology and SERE techniques.\n\nATP 3-50.3 is still Active,  and the latest version (published 2019 ) is  restricted to \"C U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR CONTRACTORS ONLY\", though it can be bought openly through regular suppliers.", "Or, you know, you can watch the animals and see what they eat before you try it.

They have their finger in all the local businesses, not really doing any harm necessarily, potentially even acting somewhat symbiotically in some instances.

If you're new to oysters here's what you'll wanna look for and rule out: \n \nSpore print: white-cream, white-lilac, or grey-lilac. Never brown, purplish, or black.\n\nSubstrate: growing from wood, trees usually dead or dying. in my area they only grow on deciduous trees. I'm not sure about globally. \n\nGrowth pattern: in a cluster, bracket-like\n\nStem: small to not present. if present often off center. Avoid a well centered, long stem. \n\nGills: smooth, rubbery, touching and often running down the stem. \n\nCap: smooth surface, free of any scales.\n\nOlder oysters tend to be prone to bugs as well so watch out for that. In my experience it's when the caps start to flatten out. You can soak them in salt water to purge bugs."]}

With knotweed in such abundance, and the window of time that they're still tender drawing ever closer to its close, I would like to gather more soon, and would also like if I can speed up how I'm getting the shoots ready. What I did today was just sit outside for about an hour with what I picked, which I'd already washed, went through each stalk, stripped off the mature leaves, broke off the tips to keep separate, and folded over the ends of the stalk to peel off ribbons of the outer skin. Some pieces seemed soft/small enough to not need peeling, but others seemed like if I bit into them without peeling I'd end up chewing on a wad of cellulose for ages. Any thoughts on going any faster or smarter?\n\nAlso, I was wondering about killing the scraps before disposing of them. I boiled what I had from today, but was wondering if leaving in the sun on pavement for a few days to dry, or in a black bag for the sun to heat, or any other more passive method, would work.\n\nI'd also appreciate any ideas on preserving or storing what I have if I do end up with a lot.

Even halfway decent acorns seem to be missing. \n\nThis weekend I was on the trails and an area that look like it might have been a patch of ramps (If I could at least find any left I\u2019d be able to tell what they looked like) and it looked like someone tore up the ground to get them all. \n\nI could chalk it up to bad luck and other people getting places first but there\u2019s only a handful of people I\u2019ve seen here over the years and most of them are SAR people running drills.

Micronutrient value & prebiotic fiber are IMO extraordinarily important and lack of prebiotic fiber in western diets is likely a leading cause of the huge surge in colon cancer rates among younger people.\n\nRamps are a great source of soluble fiber, like other allium, this makes them a top tier prebiotic food, meaning it feeds your gut microbiome. Foods grown in the wild also benefit from colonization by healthy bacteria that thrive in the soil, something a lot of grocery store vegetables lack due to chemical treatment & harsh washing. Those beneficial bacteria contribute to microbial diversity which is important for a healthy digestive tract. Early season ramps are also extremely high in beneficial sugars (beneficial sugars help regulate blood sugar and feed your brain), plus ramps contain plenty of Micronutrients, which are also boosted by the nutrient content of the soil they grow in.\n\nThe best diet is the most diverse one. The more varied the whole foods you eat are, especially when eating seasonally and from organic/wild soils, the better health your gut, and therefore your whole body will be in. Calories are one tiny little part of a very large mosaic of things you need to fuel your body. \n\n(Also you saying ramps taste like every other allium tells me either your palette is not very sensitive, or you're cooking them in a way that's underutilizing them. When I throw a ramp on the grill it *does not* taste like a regular leek or any other onion/garlic analogue. They have a particular flavor that I like to compare to the smell of sour cream & onion chips.)", "I agree, they're alright, though I do not feel they meet the hype around them.

It's why police detectives have a wall covered with pics of persons they're looking for. Frequently looking at something makes it more likely that you'll recognize it when you see it out in the field or forest. \n\nOf course, you should get several books on foraging the foods that grow in your area. I find a lot of my foraging guides at thrift stores, and in the section at my library where old or unneeded books are sold. It's nice to have several books, because you get to see different pics of the same plant or berry. When you go out looking for your berries, you can't expect the berries to present themselves exactly the way they look in the photo in one book. Lighting, sun, shade, angle and camera quality, etc can cause differences in pics of the same species of plant, flower, fruit, or fungus. \n\nI'm a visual learner, so this is what helps me the most."]}

You could then add a small amount of water and strain, but I would simply portion it out, vacuum pack and freeze the resulting syrup without straining.\n\nWhen making an oleo, all of the volatile oils are preseved.

L:\n\nThe dandelions went super smoothly, after straining out the main petals and such, I used coffee filters to get out most (90%\\~?) of any pollen, I know it's technically good for you- but I'm also technically allergic if there's any tree pollen mixed in lol.  \nIt came out super wonderful, although it did smell strangely like **potatoes** when I was steeping it, and pre-sweetened also *tasted* like some kinda potato tea (Do not reccomend tbh lol)  \nBut after boiling it down for an hour or so with a cup of 2/3 turbinado sugar, and 1/3 white sugar, I was left with a super delicate flavor reminiscent of floral honey, next time I'll use less turb-sugar for a bit less caramel taste, still good tho.  \nLove putting it in with club soda's, and I WILL find out a way to make a clone of Buc-ees candied cashews with this syrup.

I like to eat them raw when they're young and the seeds are soft, as a cucumber substitute. You can have them in soups, stuffed, stir fried, pickled (REALLY delicious), boiled for broth etc. Some varieties are less bitter.\u00a0", "I pulled the seeds out of the ripe ones I grew and let the seeds sit on a plate overnight. The next day, the Ed stuff around he sees was sort of lie gummy bear consistency and slightly sweet.\n\nThe rest of it can be cooked like zucchini or squash. You can find recipes online.

This is least risky in privately managed woodland, as you can be sure of controlling how frequent and heavy the harvests are. Sugarbushes are a perfect combination of circumstances for ramp harvest, as they're already being managed to be fairly open woodland and just a little bit of effort in transplanting and spreading seed can make for large areas of ramps that can produce significant harvests when thinned heavily on a rotation.", "AMEN!!
