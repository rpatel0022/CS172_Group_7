The main concept revolves around building up cooperations with local supermarkets and food dispensaries, to pick up the food that is not 'good enough' for sale, or would be thrown out due to overproduction. On a daily basis different *foodsavers* go to these supermarkets and food dispensaries to pick up the \u2018leftovers\u2019 and share them with their friends, neighbors and less fortunate. I am shocked every single time when I see the masses of food that are perfectly intact but destined for the trash. Of course, this not only includes fruits and vegetables, but also meat, canned food, bread, dairy products and more. This is in no way supposed to be promotional, just a depiction of how I became more aware of the issue and my take on the nonsense that our society is doing by destroy our natural resources even faster.\n\nI simply cannot understand why we have to be producing so much more food than what is being bought or can be consumed. It is estimated that the production of food plus the supermarkets are producing 22% of the food waste found in Germany. That leaves around **2.4 million tonnes of food**, that is thrown away yearly, although it is still perfectly good for consumption! Just because the tomato isn\u2019t red enough or the cucumber not straight enough consumers in stores refuse to buy it. We have more than enough people that could benefit from this wasted food, and now especially with the new energy crisis and 30% inflation, putting at least an additional half a million households in poverty.\n\nBy being part of Foodsharing, my family and I have been able to cut down our food expenses, only going to stores for household items and clothing. It is sad enough, that we need organizations like this, due to the lack of work the government is doing in restricting overproduction and food waste!!\n\n[The picture is an example of one of my pickups at a food dispensary.

{"title": "I was shocked that every person throws away over 80 kg of leftovers per year and so I created the app \"Scraips\" to do something against this huge problem", "selftext": "I would be so thankful for your feedback on Scraips! :-)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Scraips preview](https://preview.redd.it/bjc7m2rx67ec1.png?width=5000&format=png&auto=webp&s=66324ec73375ab45e14090a95fef0c8b28da0d0d)\n\n**Before you read this I will summarize the key facts so you can skip it if you are not interested in my story:**\n\nOut of frustration by my previous experience with how much food is thrown away yearly, I built an app called Scraips. Scraips is the only app, that takes your leftovers exactly as they are and creates amazing recipes. Instead of throwing away leftovers, you can use the creative AI of scraips to get some inspiration of what to cook with these ingredients. This is good for the enviroment and saves you lots of money.\n\nThe app is available for free on iOS and Android, with a membership option to generate unlimited recipes for 4,99 \u20ac or 3,99 $ a month.\u00a0**Everything else is free**.\n\nYou can check it out on iOS and Android by scanning the QR Code below:\n\n[Get scraips](https://preview.redd.it/qcv57g8l67ec1.png?width=312&format=png&auto=webp&s=51aa1265557282c54fc08fc0a16e718189a19529)\n\nOr visiting this link: [https://scraips-landing.web.app](https://scraips-landing.web.app/)\n\n**Now to our story and** ***why I built Scraips:***\n\nHello! I am Christian, a software developer who used to be terrible at cooking and finding inspiration for what to cook next. I tried countless of apps and read many blogs which I usually abandoned after a couple of days because they either put too much pressure on me by providing too much information. It seemed like nothing works and I thought maybe I am just too lazy...\n\nOver a year ago I found out about ChatGPT and the revolution it started. It made accessing AI so much easier and I was wondering if I could use it for something good. I have read countless articles and many of the currently popular books about the science behind AI in general and the food industry. During this time I have discovered so many things that\u00a0**fundamentally**\u00a0changed my way of thinking about leftovers.\n\nSince I am a developer the answer to how I wanted to share the ideas was quite simple.\u00a0*An app*.\n\nWell, there are\u00a0*countless*\u00a0of apps already available and I almost tried every single one of them. Most of them are very similar: You track your leftovers and get some recipes providing the ingredients you have. While these apps can work quite well for some people, I had a frustrating experience with most of them. Some of them were too aggressively monetised, some focusing too much on data, some of them were basically just not providing delicious and simple recipe suggestions for exaclty the ingredients I have. So IU collected some useful insights and put all of them into a new product called \"Scraips\".\n\nWith\u00a0Scraips I focused on three main things:\n\n* Simplicity\n* Zero Food Waste\n\nSimplicity\n\nFirst of all I wanted something super easy to use. I found that a lot of apps offer so many different ways to create or explore recipes, that often it\u2019s quite hard and time consuming to find your way around them. Also many of the apps which are well designed are only available on iOS. So I made the app as simple as possible to use and focused heavily on making it as pretty as possible.\n\nZero food waste\n\nSeeing how much food waste I avoid by using Scraips would really help me realize the impact. Throwing away a brocolli once is certainly not a bad thing, but if I could see how many leftovers I could save over a longer period of time through a simple tracking system, I would be much more motivated to make more of my leftovers in the future. The goal of Scraips is simple: never throw away food again.\n\nPricing\n\nLast but not least I want to be completely open with you about our pricing because that\u2019s something that bothered me a lot with other apps:\n\nI offer Scraips for free, but with a Membership option to support us. Since Scraips is a side-project I do not depend on any type of income from it so I reduced it to a minimum.\n\nThe free option allows you to create up to 10 recipes, because it costs me around 5 cents to create a recipe. The only second restriction is that you can create 9 different recipe types (like vegan, high protein or glutenfree) only as a premium user. Everything else is completely for free in the app! The price of the membership is 4,99 \u20ac or 3,99 $ per month.\n\nScraips is a project I am super passionate about. My goal is to help people easily avoid food waste, which I think is one powerful method to do something against climate change.\n\nI am happy about any kind of feedback, so feel free to share your appreciation or criticism!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodwaste/comments/19dpald/i_was_shocked_that_every_person_throws_away_over/", "created_utc": 1706019112.0, "score": 3, "author": "smartlifeapps", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/foodwaste/comments/19dpald/i_was_shocked_that_every_person_throws_away_over/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Once you've purchased an item from the list, it'll move the item into your inventory. This inventory contains all of the grocery items that you currently have. You'll get weekly reminders to update your grocery list. You can mark each item as being consumed or wasted. When you add an item that you've previously wasted to your next grocery list, it'll prompt you to come up with a strategy to avoid wasting that food next time. You can also write reflections which make you do some introspection to see what made you waste the food.\n\nIf you're interested, here's how to download our app! Unfortunately, the app will only be available for Android devices\n\n**Steps to download app:**\n\n1. Download the app, *Expo*, from the app store\n\n2.

{"title": "What features you would like to have in nosh - food stock management app to benefit you the most?", "selftext": "Hi folks,\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic started, people started to panic buy groceries in order to maintain social distancing and reduce the time they have to shop. But the biggest challenge that came with this new routine of buying habit is food waste. Managing a lot of food items in the fridge, especially the ones with shorter shelf life.\n\nTo respond to this issue, scientists of the University of Essex, UK, came together to develop free to use (with no in-app purchases) smartphone app which reminds the users of the expiry date of their stocked items before they expire. The app - called **nosh** \\- also provides recipe suggestions on the stocked items and has an in-app Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to show the user their buying and food wasting trend such that they can make an informed decision on what food items to buy the next time. Nosh also has an integrated shopping list planning so that the user can make a shopping list in-app before they buy the items (online or physically).\n\nWe have already gained more than 1K active users on the platform in our first month of release, and ranked in the Top 10 Free New apps for Productivity category in the UK's Google Play Store. Though the app can be downloaded for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.F6NHQc92Bw.nosh.technologies) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1508051308?pt=121395416&ct=reddit&mt=8).\n\nSince, our app' vision aligns with the reduction in Food Waste movement, I thought it would be good to reach out to the community and seek feedback to help in the movement.\n\nCould you please let me know what features or functions we can introduce to the nosh app such that we can serve you better and contribute to No Food Waste?\n\nThank you for your support and feedback.

We seek to mitigate that!\n\nOur company Cornucopia Group has acquired the exclusive distribution rights for a Safe (GRAS/USDA approved), Natural, GMO free, protein coating for food products that allows for smart dehydration without using costly, energy intensive, and wasteful dryers, freezers or chemicals. Our protein coating shields the foodstuffs being dehydrated from bacteria, while allowing moisture to escape. \n\nWe are applying this technology to nutrient rich \"waste\" streams such as the peels left over from juicing oranges, or sweet potatoes that are undersized, or funny shaped (but still perfectly good to eat). \n\nOver 1.3 Trillion lbs of food is wasted annually before it even gets to the stores shelves. \n\nBy capturing and utilizing pre-store food waste, we can reduce the wastes of energy in producing the food in the first place, and also in the production of more to make up for the past unnecessary losses.\n\nPlease comment in order to help refine this proposal to include the answers to your questions. I had the wonderful opportunity to attend to Climate CoLab Crowds and Climate Conference in 2015 as the winner of the Buildings category (3D Printing Hempcrete, project still alive and well). One of the most valuable parts of the whole experience was the interaction right here on the colab proposals comment sections, so dont be shy mates, chime in I treasure your thoughts!\n\nWe will continue to seek new \"waste\" streams of needlessly lost nutrients. We seek opportunities to capture the stuff that most food producers/processors are throwing away or giving away for pennies on the dollar, or in some cases are paying to get rid of...Because more often than not, its that portion of the foodstuff that has a majority of the nutrition.\n\nExample: Oranges. When oranges are juiced, the peels are either tossed on the ground to rot somewhere, or they are sold for next to nothing to be made into cattle feed, or other such \"low value\" use. The funny thing is, the peels contain vastly more nutrition than the orange fruit itself. So what we have managed to do is capture orange and other citrus peel before it is tossed out, dehydrate it using our PS Coating, and then mill it into any particle size that's needed.\n\nSince our citrus peel ingredients are not ever exposed to intense heat or cold or UV radiation, and are protected from bacteria and oxidization, they maintain significantly better appearances, nutritional and flavor profiles than similar products produced using contemporary technologies.\n\nWe primarily seek funding at this stage, as we have many exciting projects lined up with very interested parties (many of whom are companies we have all bought products from most likely at some point). Generally we see a lot of interest, but the companies are unwilling to put for the the capital to set up a facility to handle their bi-product, but if we were to do so, they would be happy to provide us with as much raw material as we could get our hands on. Which, if the model is able to spread, would allow us to significantly supplement the worlds food supply, relieving pressure on current producers.\n\nAlso I would love to assemble a true group of Abundance Advocates to join me in a social/new media blitzkrieg to build public demand for an answer to agricultural waste, and food wastefulness. To help us prove that scarcity is an illusion if we start utilizing more of what we already create. \n\nCornucopia Group, \nas well as Natural World Ingredients (one of our subsidiaries that focuses on the acquisition, production, and distribution of high end and organic food and beverage ingredients.)\n\nAlso of course we hope that MIT will join us in taking our projects to the next level via its incredible network of outstanding alumni and cohorts!\n\nThere will always be a need as well for good folks who believe in creating abundance, and are willing to help spread the word, and connect us to decision makers at food producers/processors/farmers/ingredients distributors/spice and tea makers/any entity or person who could do something better with their unused but nutritious food byproduct than throw it away. Are you one?\n\nWe currently are engaged in projects in Mexico, and Texas. Also we are in talks for projects in CA, WA, CO, OR, AK, IL, Canada, and elsewhere.\n\nAn additional benefit to our processes is that they can be implemented for a much lower capital investment, and operating cost than conventional commercial scale food dehydration systems. also, PS Coating is a much more consistent, and sanitary method for dehydration as opposed to sun-drying etc. But due to its nature, it is relatively cheap and easy to scale up using off the shelf equipment and local materials and labor. Creating jobs, and stimulating local economies as well.\n\nIn summary, these actions shall be taken worldwide, anywhere food is being needlessly wasted. We are open to leads! chad@cornucopiagroup.org\n\nAnother benefit to our processes is that we have opportunity to capture the very pure potable water that is recovered via dehydrating, and utilize it on site for drinking, or bottle it, or recycle it into the system. We capture upwards of 300 gallons of excellent H2O per hour in many cases.\n\nHeres some perspective:\n\nIn 2010, 1.5 Gtonnes of CO2 was emitted by the entire USA transportation sector. \n\nThat same year, 3.3 Gtonnes of CO2 were emitted by world FOOD WASTAGE. (from wasted energy expenditures from producing all the wasted food). \n\nImagine if this could be eliminated! We have a method to attack this problem. We would be honored to have your help!\n\nCosts for implementing our processes vary greatly from case to case, based on a number of variables. But our technology allows us to utilize all easy to obtain, off the shelf, and local materials. \n\nSome projects can cost 50K, others 5M. But in the right locations (anywhere central to agricultural production), and circumstances (we have buyers for all the material, which we usually do), our facilities can act as central hubs for collecting and preserving food that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nFolks tell their kids to think about starving kids in 3rd world countries when we want them to eat broccoli and not waste it, but someone really needs to say the same thing to big agriculture apparently. And we would like to be that someone. Except in our case we are offering people the opportunity to get paid to not waste their byproducts. It's as if a mother told her picky eater of a son not to waste his brussle sprouts because there were starving children somewhere else...but then said that actually, if he wasn't going to eat them, he could literally give them to someone who needed food...and then get paid too.\n\nWe currently have projects under way, and so the timeline for us is Now - 'till whenever we manage to capture, preserve, and distribute 100% of the worlds nutrition that is needlessly lost through waste.\n\nWe are ready now for introductions to folks interested in investing in the future of food security technology, and helping us take a bite out of waste.\n\nCheers, and I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nChad K."]}

{"title": "Food waste in big brand stores - can we do anything about it?", "selftext": "Hello fellow Reddit users. I work at Giant Eagle (A big grocery store) and the amount of food that is thrown away is just ridiculous. Last week, I was asked to help clear out the dairy section. And by clear out I mean throw away anything that is about to expire ( 5 or less days before the expiration date in this case). At least 30 gallons of milk were disposed of on that day. The volume of other diary products that I was asked to get rid of was about the same. After I got back home  from work, I began to research how much food is going to waste in those big name chains, and unsurprisingly the numbers were too high. It is depressing to know how much food is being thrown out because it expired when there are people starving all around the world. My question is, can anything be done about this waste? Is there a way to make corporations pay for their waste by donating products to communities of lower income or something?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodwaste/comments/8e70i5/food_waste_in_big_brand_stores_can_we_do_anything/", "created_utc": 1524438698.0, "score": 2, "author": "goldsamsong", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/foodwaste/comments/8e70i5/food_waste_in_big_brand_stores_can_we_do_anything/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Food waste perpetrated by food stores in America is a national disgrace. I urge you to YouTube an excellent video titled: CBC Marketplace Food Waste, This will tell you the real story on how these major grocery store chains throw out perfectly good food rather than donating it to area non-profits or churches for distribution to the needy. \n\nI do dumpster diving in Dallas and several years ago I actually found 3,000 full-size Baby Ruth candy bars on a loading dock. All the cases were sealed with an expiration date that was expired by only two weeks. I took them all and gave 2,000 to a local food pantry and distributed the other 1,000 myself to homeless people in downtown Dallas.\n\nThe question being. WHY would anyone throw away 3,000 perfectly safe and edible candy bars rather than donating them? Most of these grocery store managers are absolutely nuts for doing this. "]}

An example being salmon, it was obviously vacuum packed in a more home setting and not as sealed as in an industrial setting.

I have been reading about this topic and I found some disturbing facts about food waste. \n\nWhen we say, global hunger is for real and it's happening right now, it is actually *NOT* due to lack of food. It is because of the huge about of food we waste every day (approximately **1.3 billion tons of food** waste each year). This happens for so many reasons and at so many levels. Some of these reasons could be due to surplus seasonal food in your nearby store, buying groceries with an unplanned menu or even because of poor quality of products. \n\nAll these lost and wasted foods land in landfill, turning slowly into hazardous methane gas that is bad for human health. Worst, it also can lead to uncontrollable leakage of gas that could kill us. Remember the catastrophic waste avalanche of the Leuwigajah landfill from 2005 that killed about 143 people?\n\nHere's a detailed [blog](https://martie.com/blogs/news/what-is-food-waste-and-how-to-fight-it) about food waste and how to fight it.

It uses a fermentation process and a bacteria found in yogurt called  Lactobacillus acidophilus. It takes about four weeks (two weeks to fill the bucket, two weeks to ferment) and you can add stuff you would usually compost in addition to milk, meat and eggs. You can take the liquid fermented product and water it down before adding to some soil (you have to dilute or it could burn your plants); or take the chunks of food still in the bucket and bury them or add them to a compost pile (for the microbes in the soil to further break down). It's supposed to be a faster, more passive and  way more compact method of composting. You could also just give the end product to your local garden or composting facility (or sell it to gardeners).", "I think it\u2019s okay as long as it\u2019s not frequent. Mold on food permeates beyond what is visible. You\u2019ve probably heard that the harder a food item is, the safer it is to cut the mold off. Hard cheeses with mold, for example, are much safer to eat after cutting off the visibly bad spot than soft cheeses with mold. This is because the invisible hyphae penetrate the soft foods a lot easier. Mycotoxins released by molds can cause a number of problems. Some mycotoxins are carcinogenic, which means that just because you\u2019ve noticed no immediate effects from eating a mildly product doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not accumulating damage. We\u2019re already accumulating damage daily just by living out our lives, but there\u2019s no sense in increasing the damage by consuming things that we know will contribute to that. Cancer is all about probabilities. The more carcinogens you are exposed to, the higher the risk. \n\nI occasionally cut off mold from my food instead of throwing it out, but I\u2019m mindful that the consequences of doing so may not be immediately obvious."]}

Quand on pense au gaspillage alimentaire, on pense d'abord \u00e0 ce que gaspille le consommateur, c'est-\u00e0-dire nous, et on n'a pas tort parce qu'on est responsable de 33 % du gaspillage alimentaire global, ce qui repr\u00e9sente 30 kilos par Fran\u00e7ais et par an. Alors la premi\u00e8re question qui vient, c'est : \"Pourquoi on gaspille autant ?\" Selon Eric Birlouez, c'est en grande partie parce qu'on est encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 le faire par notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation. On s'est mis \u00e0 gaspiller beaucoup en France, comme dans d'autres pays, \u00e0 partir de la fin de la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale, dans cette p\u00e9riode qu'on a appel\u00e9 les Trente Glorieuses o\u00f9 il y avait une hausse consid\u00e9rable du pouvoir d'achat et o\u00f9 la nourriture devenait accessible. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 profusion. On avait, dans les hypermarch\u00e9s, des tonnes et des tonnes de nourriture accessibles physiquement et bien s\u00fbr financi\u00e8rement. Petit \u00e0 petit, la nourriture s'est banalis\u00e9e. Elle a perdu de sa valeur, ce qui fait qu'on lui pr\u00eate plus vraiment attention. La cl\u00e9 pour r\u00e9duire son gaspillage alimentaire, ce serait donc tout simplement de faire plus attention. C'est ce qu'est venu m'expliquer Christopher, un sp\u00e9cialiste de la lutte anti-gaspillage. Christopher, est-ce que tu peux me donner des astuces et des conseils, mais vraiment tr\u00e8s simples pour moins gaspiller? Tr\u00e8s simple : la premi\u00e8re chose, c'est aller voir ce qui est dans vos placards et vos frigos comme \u00e7a quand je fais des courses, je me souviens de ce que j'ai, je sais ce que j'ach\u00e8te. Deuxi\u00e8me conseil : apprendre \u00e0 diff\u00e9rencier les dates limites sur nos produits. En France, il y en a deux : DLC, date limite de consommation \u00e0 consommer jusqu'au. Et \u00e7a, c'est une date sanitaire, ne consommez pas apr\u00e8s. Et DDM, \u00e0 consommer de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence avant le. Vraiment une date purement informative qui informe sur la qualit\u00e9 de texture et de go\u00fbt du produit mais pas du tout sur le fait qu'on puisse le manger ou pas. Bon. Ces astuces peuvent para\u00eetre anodines et vous avez peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'impression de les mettre en place, mais \u00e7a reste tr\u00e8s important. Surtout quand on sait qu'en France, environ une personne sur cinq ne mange pas \u00e0 sa faim alors que des tonnes de nourriture sont jet\u00e9es quotidiennement \u00e0 la poubelle. Et puis produire de la nourriture, \u00e7a demande \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'\u00e9nergie et donc \u00e7a pollue. Par exemple, on estime que pour produire les 10 millions de tonnes de denr\u00e9es alimentaires qui sont gaspill\u00e9es en France chaque ann\u00e9e, il a fallu 15,3 millions de tonnes de CO2. Et \u00e7a, ce ne sont que les chiffres fran\u00e7ais. \u00c0 l'\u00e9chelle de la plan\u00e8te, on estime qu'environ un tiers de ce qui est produit termine \u00e0 la poubelle, c'est \u00e0 dire 1,3 milliard de tonnes. Je vous laisse imaginer le nombre de baleines que \u00e7a fait. En tout cas, en 2013, on estimait que \u00e7a repr\u00e9sentait 8 % des gaz \u00e0 effet de serre dans le monde. Et dans le cas des aliments qui sont finalement jet\u00e9s \u00e0 la poubelle \u00e7a pollue donc pour rien. Bon, nous les consommateurs, on a vu qu'on avait un impact sur le gaspillage et qu'on pouvait le r\u00e9duire. Mais nous ne sommes pas les seuls responsables du gaspillage. En fait, les aliments comestibles peuvent \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la poubelle tout au long de ce qu'on appelle la cha\u00eene de consommation. Et \u00e7a, \u00e7a commence d\u00e8s la phase de production. Pour le comprendre, je me rends \u00e0 Saulty, pr\u00e8s d'Arras, pour rencontrer Emmanuel Dalle, un arboriculteur qui produit des pommes. Comme on est en pleine saison des pommes, on pourrait s'attendre \u00e0 ce qu'il vende toute sa production. Et pourtant aujourd'hui, Emmanuel sait que tout le contenu de sa camionnette ne pourra pas \u00eatre vendu. Ici \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 400 kilos de pommes. Elles sont juste sales ou un petit coup mais qui ne se voit pas forc\u00e9ment sur l'\u00e9piderme. Si notre fruit n'est pas esth\u00e9tique ou n'est pas sexy, il ne va pas pouvoir trouver place en magasin. Donc l\u00e0, juste parce qu'il y a eu un coup de vent et que les pommes sont tomb\u00e9es par terre il y a 400 kilos de pommes qu'Emmanuel ne peut pas vendre sur les circuits traditionnels. Mais Emmanuel a trouv\u00e9 une solution pour sauver sa r\u00e9colte. Plut\u00f4t que de la voir perdre, On pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la ramasser et pouvoir la donner donc aujourd'hui, on va la donner \u00e0 une association qui s'appelle Andes et qui va pouvoir la distribuer \u00e0 ses associ\u00e9s. Et \u00e7a, c'est rendu possible par Solaal, Une association qui met en relation des producteurs et d'autres associations qui luttent contre la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 alimentaire. On n'a pas fait tout ce travail pour rien. Pour nous, c'est vraiment tr\u00e8s important. Si on peut trouver un avenir \u00e0 des fruits qui ne sont pas conformes \u00e0 ce que veut le march\u00e9, il faut foncer. Une fois que les denr\u00e9es ont pass\u00e9 le cap du producteur elles arrivent au niveau du distributeur. Et l\u00e0 aussi, le risque de terminer \u00e0 la poubelle est grand. En 2011, on estimait que les pertes alimentaires d'un seul supermarch\u00e9 \u00e9taient d'environ 197 tonnes par an. Mais en 2016, une nouvelle loi relative au gaspillage alimentaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place. D'abord, elle interdit aux grandes surfaces de d\u00e9truire ou de rendre impropres \u00e0 la consommation leurs invendus. Et puis elle oblige les supermarch\u00e9s de plus de 400 m\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s \u00e0 chercher des partenariats avec des associations d'aide alimentaire afin de leur c\u00e9der gratuitement leurs invendus. D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, \u00e7a marche, puisqu'aujourd'hui 96 % des grandes et moyennes surfaces pratiquent le don \u00e0 des associations. Mais il y a encore pas mal de marge pour \u00e9radiquer le gaspillage. En fait, un magasin sur deux n'est pas collect\u00e9 tous les jours ce qui fait que de nombreuses denr\u00e9es p\u00e9rissables finissent tout de m\u00eame \u00e0 la poubelle. Souvent, c'est \u00e0 cause de probl\u00e8mes logistiques : par manque de main d'\u0153uvre ou parce que les invendus des magasins ne correspondent pas aux besoins des associations. Mais depuis quelques ann\u00e9es certains magasins se sont sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration de denr\u00e9es vou\u00e9es au gaspillage. C'est notamment le pari des \u00e9piceries Nous anti-gaspi. Elles ne proposent que des produits qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 jet\u00e9s sur le circuit traditionnel. Pour comprendre comment ces \u00e9piceries s'approvisionnent on m'a donn\u00e9 rendez-vous \u00e0 5h30 \u00e0 Rungis. C'est parti. Rungis, c'est tout simplement le plus grand march\u00e9 de produits agricoles du monde. Sur plus de 230 hectares, 1400 grossistes vendent de la viande, des fruits, des l\u00e9gumes des produits laitiers \u00e0 tous les professionnels de l'alimentation de l'\u00cele de France. Alors forc\u00e9ment, quand vient l'heure de la fermeture du march\u00e9 vers sept heures du matin, il reste pas mal de choses. Chaque jour, il y a des tonnes et des tonnes d'invendus et donc potentiellement de produits qui terminent \u00e0 la poubelle. Et \u00e7a, \u00e7a repr\u00e9sente une opportunit\u00e9 absolument \u00e9norme pour des entreprises comme Nous anti-gaspi. Et c'est l\u00e0 qu'entre en jeu Rapha\u00ebl. Rapha\u00ebl, c'est quelqu'un qui dit bonjour \u00e0 tout le monde. Mais c'est surtout l'acheteur des \u00e9piceries Nous anti-gaspi. L\u00e0, nous avons du filet de canard. Il peut y avoir quelques d\u00e9fauts,\n\nsoit \u00e0 l'arrachage ou soit compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 l'abattage, il peut y avoir des ecchymoses. C'est pour \u00e7a qu'ils les classent dans cat\u00e9gorie B. Les clients ne les veulent pas. Et donc nous, on les r\u00e9cup\u00e8re,\n\nparce que la date avance. Et quand il n'a pas les ventes, au bout d'un moment, il les jette. Chaque jour. Rapha\u00ebl fait tout le tour de Rungis. Il cherche des dates de p\u00e9remption qui approchent\n\ndes produits qu'il faut trier, ou d'autres qui sont mal \u00e9tiquet\u00e9s ou tout simplement un peu moches.\n\nEt notamment gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa tourn\u00e9e, les \u00e9piceries Nous anti gaspi r\u00e9ussissent \u00e0 sauver 150 tonnes de produits alimentaires par mois. En conclusion, les choses sont en train de bouger et chacun \u00e0 son \u00e9chelle peut contribuer \u00e0 r\u00e9duire le gaspillage alimentaire m\u00eame nous \u00e0 la cantine.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodwaste/comments/isc5gs/causes_du_gaspillage_alimentaire/", "created_utc": 1600050419.0, "score": 1, "author": "Christotoooo", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/foodwaste/comments/isc5gs/causes_du_gaspillage_alimentaire/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": [" 'e gaspillage alimentaire \nExiste aussi niveau international.\nCommerces familles...\nTriste constat !", "Gaspillage alimentaire.\n25 kgs a la poubelle ?\nRevoir tous les acteurs \nDe l alimentation.\nCommerces et foyers.\nLes conseils en alimentation \nDes restaurateurs.\nEt m\u00e9decins nutritionnistes.\nLes associations humanitaires \nEt manque de nourriture.\nAutres ?"]}

{"title": "Am I wrong for feeling angry at my friend?", "selftext": "My friend was recently injured so I've been trying to help her out by visiting and cooking for her. About a few days ago now I made my friend a big pot of spaghetti and garlic bread. Today as I was visiting, J told me out of the blue how she ate two bowls of spaghetti and threw everything else into her trash can. She then said tell your grandma not to make me anymore food. I don't want her to waste anymore money. This statement bothered because I made the food not one of my relatives. And second of all she made it seem as if anything I brought her would just end up in the trash. I didn't say anything about her statement and kept J company for about an hour longer before leaving but this comment she made has been bothering for hours now. I feel annoyed because my friend is always saying how she is frugal and doesn't waste food. When J has made this comment to me on multiple occasions in casual conversation, she must have been saying I'll never waste my food but I'll waste other people's food. \nWhat makes this scenario worse for me is that I was purposely starved and yelled at for eating as a child so now any food waste at all greatly upsets me. It upsets me so much to the point where I'll ignore or won't talk to anyone who intentionally wastes food. I won't argue with the other person at all. Instead I'll just fall silent and won't talk. I know this sounds childish but it is awkward to say I'm upset at you for throwing away the spaghetti that took me time to buy, prepare, and bring to you. It is just easier to disappear until my emotions about the event cool down. \nP.S. I was just trying to help her the was she has helped me many times in the past.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodwaste/comments/13wh564/am_i_wrong_for_feeling_angry_at_my_friend/", "created_utc": 1685524651.0, "score": 0, "author": "Busy_Construction_52", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/foodwaste/comments/13wh564/am_i_wrong_for_feeling_angry_at_my_friend/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Food waste management solution", "selftext": "What is Food Waste Recycling and Composting?\n\nFood waste recycling and composting are two processes that aim to convert food waste into a useful product. Food waste recycling converts food waste into energy through anaerobic digestion or other processes, while composting turns food waste into a valuable soil amendment. Composting involves breaking down food waste into a nutrient-rich material that can be used to improve soil health and promote plant growth.\n\nBenefits of Food Waste Recycling and Composting\n\nReduces Landfill Waste: Food waste makes up a significant portion of the waste that ends up in landfills. When food waste is recycled or composted, it reduces the amount of waste in landfills, helping to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced.\n\nImproves Soil Health: Composting food waste results in a rich soil amendment that can be used to improve soil health and promote plant growth.\n\nReduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Landfills are a significant source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By reducing the amount of food waste in landfills, food waste recycling and composting can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSaves Resources: The production of food requires significant amounts of resources, including water, energy, and land. When food waste is composted, these resources are conserved and can be used to produce more food.\n\nFood Waste Recycling and Composting Machines\n\nTo make food waste recycling and composting more accessible and efficient, many companies have developed food waste recycling and composting machines. These machines make it easy for households and businesses to recycle food waste, and they can be used to produce compost in a matter of days, rather than weeks or months.\n\nSome examples of food waste recycling and composting machines include:\n\nFoodCycler: This compact machine uses high-heat to rapidly break down food waste into a nutrient-rich compost.\n\nJora Composter: This composting machine uses a patented system to compost food waste in a matter of weeks, and it can be used both indoors and outdoors.\n\nGreen Cycler: This machine shreds food waste into small pieces, making it easier to compost and reducing the time it takes to produce compost.\n\nIn conclusion, food waste recycling and composting are essential steps towards sustainable living. These processes can help reduce waste in landfills, conserve resources, and improve soil health. With the availability of food waste recycling and composting machines, it is easier than ever to incorporate these practices into our daily lives. So let's do our part in creating a more sustainable future by reducing food waste and turning it into a valuable resource.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodwaste/comments/10wp5t8/food_waste_management_solution/", "created_utc": 1675836609.0, "score": 0, "author": "Nanjgelgreen", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/foodwaste/comments/10wp5t8/food_waste_management_solution/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
