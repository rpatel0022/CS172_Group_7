This will allow us to heat the hollandaise with water on the stove top.\n\n2.Now melt down your butter. Separate the water and fat solids from the butter and transfer pure butter into a measuring cup. You'll need approx. 250ML of pure butter. Let cool for a few minutes.\n\n3.Now mix the egg, lemon, salt and water together. Whip the mixture and slowly add heat by heating the pot and placing the bowl on top and continue to keep mixing and whipping air into the mixture with a whisk. Do not allow this to get too hot or you will scramble the eggs.\n\n4.Once you applied heat move the bowl to a safe place to whisk. You can use another pot with a tea towel inside to prevent the bowl from moving and to provide a soft surface. Continue whisking and slowly add the butter continuing to whisk and mix in evenly. Do not add the butter too fast or when its too hot.\n\n5.Mix together well and you are ready to serve. You can store this in a thermos for about 30 minutes to keep it warm.", "\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29", "It looks delicious, but is this comfort food or gourmet?"]}
