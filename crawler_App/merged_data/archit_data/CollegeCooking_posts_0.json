I usually use 4 or 5)\n\n\u20223 cherry peppers \n\n\u20223 Serrano peppers \n\n\u20221 Poblano pepper\n\n\u2022Salt and Pepper to taste, but I don\u2019t use that much.\n\n**RECIPE PROCESS**\n\nDeseed all vegetables.  Blend every thing but the tomatoes first.   A food processor is easier to get the consistency you want.   Deseed everything.  Then either add the tomatoes and blend them a little less, or hand cut for chunkier salsa. (That\u2019s the way I do it anyway).    You can control how Spicey it is based on the amount of habaneros you use.   That makes by far the most difference.", "This looks delicious \ud83d\ude0d, going to try to make this thank you!

I've done this and a ramen noodle stir fry (which I think I'll post next time I make it). It's wicked cheap, and the ingredients I bought made about 3 portions.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 chicken breasts\n\n* 2 bags of baby spinach\n\n* Your favorite jarred pasta sauce (this one was from Trader Joe's)\n\n* Olive oil (or canola oil, I guess anything like that works, really)\n\n* Salt, pepper, garlic powder, red pepper flakes (optional)\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Season chicken breasts on both sides with oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. A little goes a long way with the oil, you only need enough to rub on the chicken.\n\n2. Broil the chicken in the oven. I should have paid attention to how long it takes for it to cook all the way, but there should be no pink when it's done. I want to say it took about 15-20 minutes. **PRO TIP:** I do this on a baking tray and put foil on the tray first, so I don't have to clean it later.\n\n3. Cook the pasta according to the directions on the box.\n\n4. Put some olive oil (enough to just coat the bottom of the pan) in a frying/saute pan, and the two bags of spinach. One the spinach wilts down, season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes (optional).\n\n5. When the chicken is finished, let it sit (so all the juices don't run out) and slice.\n\nAfter the chicken, pasta, and spinach are all done, it's easy to portion out everything if you're saving it for later. Everything (pasta, sauce, chicken, and spinach) goes in the same container, and you can divide it for your own portion size, or as many days as you need it.\n\nI wish I could be more exact, but I tend to eyeball a lot of things when I cook."]}

You\u2019ve done this before I\u2019m sure. \n\nTry using a vegetable peeler to cut the lamb mince loaf into thin slices. Or those slicey bits on the side of the cheese grater that no one ever uses. Or just use a knife but the thinner the better. \n\nPut them in the flat bread too. \n\nWrap up in tin foil. And eat it. \n\nTry switching it up if you don\u2019t have everything to hand. Stick in cheddar instead of feta. Put it in a pita not a flatbread. Change the meat. Burger sauce. Garlic mayo. Whatever your drunk heart desires. Literally anything. It\u2019s basically a sandwich. You don\u2019t need instructions. \n\nThey can be premade and wrapped in tinfoil for later. I managed to pass out on the sofa waiting for it to reheat in the oven and it survived being cooked for 7 hours so it\u2019s definitely hard to mess up because I still ate it. "]}

I do. You\u2019ll know how to make tapioca pearls and classic boba milk tea just as good as store bought after this. It\u2019s super easy with only 4 ingredients and you know exactly what goes into your favourite cup of boba tea.\n\n[Full recipe with visual instructions here if anyone needs](https://youtu.be/lSZkaPxEdp4)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 180 tapioca starch\n* 100g water\n* 12g dark cocoa powder\n* 90g dark brown sugar\n\n**Boba tea recipe:** (Adjust to your taste. I used 5tbsp milk powder for 500ml black tea)\n\n* Whole milk powder\n* Black tea\n* Dark brown sugar\n* Whipping cream (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a bowl of 180g tapioca starch, mix in 12g dark cocoa powder. Mix well until combined.\n2. In a saucepan, add 100ml water and 90g black sugar. Whisk until dark brown sugar is dissolved, cook under medium heat until just started to boil, turn off the stove and pour in our tapioca and cocoa powder mixture.\n3. Gently mix the tapioca starch to sugar water. Pour this mixture to a clean surface and gently knead for 3-5 minutes or until it\u2019s fully combined. (If this mixture is too hot for you, don\u2019t forget to wear gloves)\n4. Divide the tapioca dough to 8 small pieces, wrap the rest of the dough to avoid drying. Shape the tapioca dough to a long log, cut into 0,5 cm pieces. Shape it to small round tapioca balls. Do not make them too big as the pearls will get bigger once it\u2019s cooked.\n5. After you passed the patience test of shaping all of those little tapioca pearls. Sprinkle on top a thin layer of tapioca starch. Shake it to remove excess starch, pour into a hot boiling water pot and boil for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid the tapioca pearls stick to the bottom of the pot.\n6. After 25 minutes boiling, turn off the stove and let the pot sit for another 20 minutes. After 20 more minutes sitting, drain the pot and tapioca pearls to a strainer.\n7. In a sauce pan, put in 120ml water, 50g black sugar and the tapioca pearls back to bring it to a boil for 3-5 minutes. Now our tapioca pearls is done.\n\n**Making boba milk tea**\n\n8.\tPour hot water to a cup of black tea leaves and let it sit for a while. Drain the black tea leaves and put in whole milk powder, stir until the milk powder is fully dissolved. 9.\tPut tapioca pearls in the bottom of a cup, pour milk tea to the cup, top with whipping cream if you like, and more tapioca pearls.  Oh yummy!\n\nEnjoy making this delicious homemade bubble tea and I hope the tapioca pearls cure all of your sadness!", "Interesting that you included cocoa powder in the tapioca pearls - never tried that before! Will try that out next time\n\nI usually use the [bubble tea recipe](https://www.honestfoodtalks.com/how-to-make-bubble-tea-boba-recipe/) from Honest Food Talks. Pretty simple, but I like the tea blends suggested, combining Assam, Oolong and Ceylon/", "Should I adjust the amount of tapioca starch if I don\u2019t want to use cocoa powder? I don\u2019t have it and I do not care about the color", "Did any actually try this?  It made soup for me.

This is a **very** versatile dish, and the seasoning packet that the beans came with just made things easier (I believe there are more than cajun, saw one say chicken). You could easily use many different types of meats, broths, and add in many different types of vegetables and seasonings.\n\nThe entire pot will last me quite a while (made in a dutch oven and it makes things SUPER easy and you can do everything in this one pot to really get all the flavors, it's been the most versatile cooking vessel i think I could ever use). \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 Hurst's HamBeans Brand 15 Bean Soup pouch (I used the one w/ cajun seasoning packet), you can find it at pulbix or walmart or wherever (pretty easy to find)\n\n* 1 onion, diced\n\n* 2 garlic cloves, minced\n\n* 1lb meat (honestly, could use damn near anything here, I got some mild Italian sausage for cheap to make a gumbo style)\n\n* 1 14oz can diced tomatoes \n\n* 1 quart chicken broth (totally optional, could easily just use water but i wanted more flavor)\n\n**Process**\n\n1. Thoroughly rinse beans\n\n2. Bring 2 quarts water to boil in a large pot. Once boiling, drop in 3 tablespoons salt and remove from heat and fully dissolve. \n\n3. Dump beans into pot, cover, and let sit for an hour (remember, this is off the heat)\n\n4. Drain beans (you can optionally save 2 cups of drained liquid for later. *Note,* it will be rather salty so either use less if you like less-salty, or wait until the soup is done to salt/pepper to taste)\n\n5. Wipe the pot clean, place 1 TBSP oil in the pot and heat until just smoking, then brown/cook your meat (if using sausage, remove from casing and crumble it. If using chicken, make it into small slices or cubes). Once meat is browned, remove and set aside in a bowl. Remove any excess grease\n\n6. Throw in the diced onion and cook until just turning brown. Throw in the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30seconds (I also used some red pepper flakes here because i wanted extra kick)\n\n7. Dump in liquids/water and the can of tomatoes (should be a total 8 cups liquid here excluding can of tomatoes, again can be any arrangement of broth/water/reserved liquid really) and then the beans and meat. Cover, and  lightly simmer for roughly 1 hour or until beans become soft (may take longer or shorter, check/stir every once in a while)\n\nI poured it over some rice and tore some parsley over it. CAME OUT AWESOME! Overall, this probably costs $10 and will last me the next week or two (assuming i don't eat it all tonight). Freezes very well also\n\n"]}

Cook it for 10/12 minutes (look at the package of the pasta, a little *al dente* is the best). When the time is up, drain the pasta (better to taste it first) and put it in the pan with the \"sauce\" or \"condiment\" or whatever you call it that you will have prepared while the pasta was cooking \n\n**The Sauce or Condiment or Whatever:**\nClean the anchovies from the spines, cut the olives and the cherry tomatoes in half or smaller parts. Have the tuna ready (I used the classic canned one). \nPut oil in the pan and let it heat up. Then put the anchovies in, let them \"flake\" a little and then put the tuna in. Then, the tomatoes, that will release the water inside them making the liquid/sauce part of the dish. At last, the olives. I put them last because I don't them to become too soft, but that's a personal choice I guess. \nAs for the time, the pasta required 10 minutes to cook, so I put the anchovies in the pan when there were 5 minutes left and finished cooking the sauce or condiment or whatever when the pasta was ready.\n\nThen put the drained pasta in the pan and mix everything together. A little hot pepper can be added, if you want. \n\nOf course this being a very simple recipe, the quality of the ingredients is a key element. I mean, the quality is always important, but with a simple recipe like this the \"goodness\" and overall tastiness of the dish is directly proportional to the quality of the ingredients. The anchovies were fresh from the market (here in this little town in Sicily everything is fresh and godly good), the tuna was canned with olive oil, the cherry tomatoes and olives were \"kilometer zero\", from the countryside around the town.

{"title": "How about some more realistic college recipes?", "selftext": "In this subreddit, and seemingly across the internet, people seem to have no idea what constitutes \"student food\".\n\n\nStudent food should:\n\n- have relatively few, common, cheap ingredients\n\n- require no special equipment beyond a frying pan or a single standard pot (microwave, toaster oven a bonus for our dorm-bound brethren). That means panini presses, no waffle irons, no pressure cookers.\n\n- take no more than 15-30 minutes for prep, cooking, eating, and ALL cleanup (amortization over several days via leftovers is acceptable, as long as its not more than 1 hour in a given day). Most days I seriously have 30 minutes for the ENTIRE DAY to eat, and the larger the block of time, the harder it is to fit it in. Even 5 minutes extra is cutting into my already unhealthy sleep schedule. I also think some people seriously underestimate cleanup time -- having to do dishes at all adds 15 minutes or more.\n\n\nGood examples:\n\nPB&J (errynight!)\n\nKraft dinner (pushing it time-wise, but can cook multiple boxes)\n\nGrilled cheese\n\nFried balogna sandwiches\n\nDeli sandwiches, whatever meat is cheapest (Bologna or mortadella usually)\n\n\nAnyways, just trying to give some perspective of what an actual student goes through, since most of the pinterest \"lists\" are clearly not written by students (brie? baked salmon? hell even hamburger is so expensive these days you might as well eat out).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/3fle31/how_about_some_more_realistic_college_recipes/", "created_utc": 1438585169.0, "score": 21, "author": "None", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/3fle31/how_about_some_more_realistic_college_recipes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["What about fried rice?

Keep Stirring.\n* Mix 1 tbsp of Corn flour with water nicely in a small bowl and put it into the pan, keep stirring it fastly\n* No need to add salt because all the sauces already are salty, but taste it once and if you want more salt add it.\n* The saucy gravy is ready\n* Add your fried chicken now, stir it nicely for few min\n\nAnd the tasty Chicken Manchurian is ready.

{"title": "Cheesy Buffalo Croissants", "selftext": "[My rather artsy photos...](http://imgur.com/az92GBD)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 package of croissants \n* 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese\n* 1/2 cup Ranch dressing (I used a homemade Ranch and it was *delicious*, but any kind works!)\n* 1/4 cup Frank's Buffalo sauce (more if you like it spicy)\n* 8 slices mozzarella cheese\n* deli meat of your choice (I used ham, but I think shredded chicken would be amazing in this recipe)\n* 1 T. butter\n* garlic powder\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Pre-heat your oven to 375 (or whatever temperature your croissants tell you to) and pop those suckers open, rolling them out onto a non-stick pan.\n\n2. In a bowl toss in your shredded cheddar, pour in the Ranch, the Frank's, and add in a bit of garlic powder (how much is up to you) and mix it all together.\n\n3. Spoon out the buffalo mixture and spread it across your croissant triangles. Top that with a slice of mozzarella, whichever meat you chose, and then spread a little more of that buffalo on top of that!\n\n4. Roll your croissants up as you would normally. They'll bulge and the buffalo mixture will squish out deliciously. This is normal, you aren't a failure. :)\n\n5. In a microwave-safe mug/bowl melt your butter and some more garlic powder for about 10 seconds. Get it melty enough to spread it across the tops of your croissants and let a little drip into the stuffing of your croissants if you wish, because garlic butter is magical.\n\n6. Stick the pan in the oven and bake for about 12 minutes, checking on it occasionally. You may have to adjust the baking time depending on your oven. When the tops are golden and the cheese is bubbling it's ready to take out of the oven!\n\n7. Let it cool, or don't. But you've been warned. Now eat, and enjoy that crap!\n\nPlease let me know what you thought if you make them!

So over the day I googled each recipe and tried making them. After making 50 or so sandwiches that I really enjoyed tasting, I had an idea to share these recipes as an app and to spread the sunshine. So I created the following app keeping in mind of all the difficulties I faced while searching for exotic sandwiches to make. You can download it at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eightloop.com.a101sandwiches&hl=en.\nSome of the sandwiches you can find in the app are\n\n1. Croque Madam\n\n2.

Enjoy\n\n**Note for extremely lazy people:** If you don\u2019t want to prep and cook the ingredients in a pot before adding it to the rice, just add all of the ingredient and seasoning to the rice cooker, it would turned out fine even tho it\u2019d be better if you cook the garlic and shallot to make it smell better.

Add baking soda, 1 teaspoon of salt, and \u00bc cup of water. Let it sit for 15 minutes \u2013 1 day. This process will give the shrimp a snappy texture, as well as brining them, ensuring that they stay juicy. Feel free to skip this step.\n2.\tRemove shrimp from solution and rinse them thoroughly.\n3.\tBeat the eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt\n4.\tIn a pan, add a generous amount of oil (2 \u2013 3 tablespoons)\n5.\tAdd the eggs to the pan. When the eggs start to bubble and you can see the that the underside has started to set, add cooked rice.\n6.\tWorking quickly, work the egg on top of the rice, then break up the rice and eggs. Cook and stir until the rice starts to separate into smaller chunks, about 3 minutes.\n7.\tPush the rice to the far half of the pan and add in shrimp. Allow them to cook for about 30 seconds per side. Add sake to the shrimp and allow it to cook for another 20 seconds, then incorporate the shrimp into the rice. Cook together for about 1 minute.\n8.\tAdd sliced green onions and stir. Season the rice with salt and pepper. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes.\n9.\tFinally, make a small amount of space in the pan and pour soy sauce in the space. Allow the soy sauce to cook until it becomes very fragrant, then incorporate it into the rice. Once incorporated, turn off the heat.\n10.\tTaste the rice and season if necessary. \n11.\tAdd the shrimp to a rice bowl first, then add rice on top.\n12.\tFlip bowl onto a plate and allow it to steam for 1 minute, then remove the bowl.\n13.\tGarnish with pickled ginger on the side.\n\n### Notes:\n- If you want to substitute meat for shrimp, skip the baking soda-salt brine, instead, marinating with soy sauce and sesame oil. Then cook the meats beforehand until fully cooked, then add them in place of the shrimp in step 7.\n- Likewise, if you want to use pre-cooked shrimp, jump to step 3.\n- Cooked rice is safe to use in this recipe, as long as it isn't overly moist. If the rice easily mushes when scooping into a bowl, then it's too moist. If using day-old rice with this recipe, cook the rice in the pan until it begins to soften up, but still has a bit of hardness to it. Remove it from the pan, then continue on from step 4.\n", "Looks yummy and very easy! the pickled ginger would taste great with it! Thank you! "]}

Alrighty, that being said...\n\n**What you need**:\n\n*For the rolls*\n* 1 can of regular size crescent rolls\n* 1 Tblsp butter\n* brown sugar\n* cinnamon (there were no specific measurements for these two)\n\n*For the icing*\n* 1/2-1 cup powdered sugar\n* 1/2 tsp brown sugar\n* 1/4 tsp vanilla\n* 1/2 Tblsp butter, melted\n* whole milk, as needed\n\n**What you do**:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 375 F\n2. Roll out your crescent rolls and press them into one long sheet of dough.\n3. Spread the butter over the dough. Mix your brown sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle it over the top of the butter in a nice, even layer.\n4. Roll the dough into a log. Slice the dough every one inch.\n5. Place rolls in a greased baking pan and bake about 9 minutes.\n6. While the rolls are baking, you'll mix up your icing. Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Add brown sugar and vanilla and mix.\n7. Next, add your powdered sugar. Stir together, adding milk as needed to reach the right consistency. \n8. Drizzle your icing over your rolls when you pull them out of the oven and \"let them cool\"... I skip that part, usually.\n9. Enjoy! :D\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/1fmvaf/cinnamon_crescent_rolls_step_by_step/", "created_utc": 1370323897.0, "score": 13, "author": "unforgiving_cake", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/1fmvaf/cinnamon_crescent_rolls_step_by_step/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["This sounds fantastic.

Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and return it to the stovetop over medium heat. While continuously whisking, heat the mixture until bubbling and completely thickened. Remove the pot from the heat. Whisk the vanilla and butter into the custard until smooth, then transfer the custard to a bowl. Cover the custard with plastic wrap, carefully pressing the plastic directly against the surface of the custard to avoid a skin forming. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until completely cooled. Punch the risen dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out until about 1/2\u2033 thick. Use a 3\u2033 biscuit or cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough. Knead the remaining dough back into a ball and continue to roll it out and cut rounds until you\u2019ve used as much dough as you can. Place the rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving about 1\u2033 of room between each round. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow them to rise for 20-30 minutes, or until doubled in size. Heat the oil in a large pot to 360F.

Made some dumplings using a recipe my    Grandma and Dad gave me for authentic dumplings made exactly like  they   do in China. It takes awhile, but it makes A TON of dumplings  that   easily serves 6 - 8 people. Or you can freeze them and reheat  when   needed.\n\n[Step by Step Instructions Here](https://youtu.be/knVNnD4SqOs)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Dough:  \n\n   * 6 Cups of Flour\n   * 1 \u2154 Cup Lukewarm Water\n* Filling:  \n\n   * 2 lbs Ground Pork\n   * 4 - 5 Napa Cabbage Leaves\n   * 1 Tbsp Minced Ginger\n   * 4 Spring Onions, Minced\n   * 1 Tbsp Salt\n   * \u2153 Cup Water\n   * \u00bc Cup Soy Sauce\n   * 1 tsp Sesame Oil\n\n**Directions:**\n\nDough\n\n1. Add the Flour and lukewarm water in a bowl.\n2. Knead it into a shaggy dough\n3. Turn    it out onto a lightly floured counter and knead for 5 - 10 mins or    until not sticking to you or the table. The motion is to PUSH the dough,    then pull back. Not just press into the dough\n4. Set it aside, covered, while preparing the filling\n\nFilling\n\n1. Chop up the Napa cabbage leaves into a fine mince, then set in a bowl and salt it. Let it sit while the prep the rest\n2. Mince up the ginger and green onions then set aside\n3. Add    ground pork to a bowl and add the salt, water, and soy sauce in small    additions while stirring in one direction (I chose clockwise) - this    will develop a better protein matrix that stays juicier as it cooks.\n4. Add the ginger, scallions, and sesame oil and stir again\n5. Wring the cabbage out dry - it should release a shocking amount of water. Then add the cabbage to the pork and stir\n\nAssembly\n\n1. Rip a chunk of dough off and lightly knead it into a flat disk\n2. Then poke a hole in the center and working your hands around the doughnut shape, stretch out the circumference of the dough\n3. Rip the dough at a point, then roll it into a log about the diameter of an adult thumb\n4. Cut or rip pieces off the dough log the size of half and adult thumb\n5. Roll those pieces into balls, then smash flat to make small disks\n6. Using    a rolling pin, roll from the edge of the disk to the center then    slightly rotate and repeat, making sure to leave the center thicker than    the edges. This will allow more filling to be put in the dumpling.    Repeat this till the disk is \\~3in/7.5cm\n7. Put a Tbsp of the filling in the center of the dough\n8. Press it down to remove air pockets\n9. Take the opposite ends of the dough and fold them together, Pinch em to form a seem.\n10. Using your thumb and base of your index finger, crimp/seal the edges to form the dumpling.\n11. Repeat steps 1 - 6, THEN steps 7 - 10 in batches. Doing all the dough at once will dry it out before you can fill all the disks\n\nCooking\n\n1. Bring a pot of water to a boil\n2. Stir it to form a current/whirlpool\n3. Drop the dumplings into the whirlpool\n4. Cover and lower the heat to medium\n5. Once the water starts boiling again, add some cool water and gently stir to form another whirlpool\n6. Cover the repeat step 5 two more times, or until the meat registers 165F\n7. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked dumplings from the pot and plate em up\n\nThat's    it! Again, it does take some time and is best done with others. But    this recipe makes a truly staggering amount of dumplings that last for    multiple meals.\n\nI hope you make it and let me know how it goes!"]}

If you\u2019re anything like me, you  used to either burn your rice into a brick of charcoal or turn it into a  waterlogged mess.

Made a  video of both methods along with two dishes where rice is a major  component, so that we\u2019re not always eating plain rice. A Crispy Rice  Plate, and Egg Fried Rice.\n\n[Take a look here if you\u2019re interested](https://youtu.be/IOyVWbG1O6o)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Crispy Rice Plate Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 Cups Cooked Rice\n* 1 Cup Water\n* Oil\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Blend \u00bd cup of the cooked rice and the 1 cup of water until you get a smooth slurry\n2. Preheat a non stick pan, or well oiled pan on medium high heat then pour the slurry in\n3. Cook the slurry until bubbly\n4. Spread the remaining 1 \u00bd cup cooked rice on top of the bubbling slurry in an even layer\n5. Pour oil around the edge/outside perimeter of the pan\n6. Let the rice fry without disturbing or touching it\n7. Once  your hear it stop steaming and start crackling AND once the top of the  rice looks dry, put a plate on top of the pan and flip the rice over. It  should come out in one piece with a crispy, crackly top facing up\n\n**Fried Rice Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 Cups Cooked Rice\n* 3 Eggs\n* 3 Green Onions\n* Oil\n* 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n* 1 tsp Sesame Oil (Optional)\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Dry out the rice, if it\u2019s fresh cooked, spread it out onto a sheet or plate in a thin layer and let it sit out for 15 mins\n2. Slice the green onions, separating the green parts from the white parts\n3. In a bowl, crack the eggs and scramble them\n4. Preheat a non stick pan, well oiled pan, or Wok on high heat\n5. Pour a bit of oil into the pan then turn the heat to low\n6. Pour  the scrambled eggs in and with a spatula scrape towards the center of  the pan, starting at 12 o\u2019clock, then 6 o\u2019clock, then 3 o\u2019clock, and  then 9 o\u2019clock\n7. Fold up the eggs and cut them up a bit, then take them out of the pan\n8. Turn the heat to medium high, pour some more oil into the pan, and dump the white parts of the cut up onions and the rice\n9. Using the spatula break up the clumps of rice into small pieces\n10. Dump the eggs back in and also break them up into small pieces\n11. Pour the soy sauce in the pan and mix the fried rice around to coat it in the soy sauce\n12. Repeat step 11 with the sesame oil if using\n13. Take it out of the pan and enjoy!\n\nIf you try either method or made either dish, let me know. Would love to hear the feedback from you all!"]}

Add in your dough and cover with cling film or a clean, damp kitchen towel.\r  \n\r  \nWe are going to let this proof in a warm space for at least 30 minutes, or untill it has doubled in size.\r  \n\r  \nWhile your dough is proofing you can use this time to make a great pizza sauce that\u2019s ready in literally minutes and will elevate your pizza game.\r  \n\r  \nFor a great homemade tomato sauce you\u2019re going to need 1 shallot or half of a yellow onion, 3 cloves of garlic and some fresh basil.\r  \n\r  \nDice the shallot into small pieces. Then take 3 cloves of garlic and crush them with your knife so you can easily peel them and then cut them into small bits as well.\r  \n\r  \nPluck a handfull of fresh basil leaves , roll them tightly toghether and slice them thinly.\r  \n\r  \nIn a small saucepan add in some olive oil and place it on medium low heat\r  \n\r  \nOnce the oil is hot you can add in your diced shallot- sweat it for a few minutes until it becomes translucent. Then you can add in your diced garlic- after a minute or so you can open up your can of diced tomatoes and add it in along with your freshly cut basil. Add some salt and pepper and let it simmer for 10 minutes on low heat. This way all the aromas will infuse your tomato sauce and you\u2019ll end up with a great tasting pizza.\r  \n\r  \nNow that your sauce is ready you can prep your toppings - this is the part where you can get creative \u2013 anything is permited.\r  \n\r  \nPlace your pizza stone inside the oven one hour before you actually cook your pizza and set your oven on the highest temperature (mine goes up to 250 celcius 482 f).\r  \n\r  \nWhen your dough has doubled in size and is nice and fluffy lightly punch it down, then turn it out onto the work surface - Divide it into 2 equal portions. You can weigh them to keep them even, but I almost always just eyeball it.\r  \n\r  \nNow it\u2019s time to shape your pizza- first you need to oil your work surface\r  \n\r  \nUsing a rollingpin, shape your pizza by rolling it into opposite directions so it stretches evenly.\r  \n\r  \nNow that your dough looks like a pizza, it\u2019s time to assemble it.\r  \n\r  \nSlide it onto your pizza peel and then directly onto your hot pizza stone. This will be ready in under 10 minutes, depending on how hot your oven is it could take anywhere from 7-15 minutes- just keep your eye on it, once the crust is golden and the cheese is melted your pizza is ready!"]}

You need to have a relative that had a cow go down and they don't have any more room in the freezer for hamburger.\n2. You need to thaw the hamburger out in the fridge, and let it sit in a big Tupperware container for at least a week. When you scoop it out with a spatula, it needs to stick to the spatula like tar. Slap it in a saucepan and set it to medium heat and put a lid on it.\n3. You'll need half a box of pasta. I used Rotini because I had it, you could use the wagon wheels too. Boil some water and add the pasta.\n4. Stir and break up that hamburger and make sure it's browning good. When it's good and browned, drain the goop out of the bottom. Put it back on the stove on low-medium heat.\n5. By now your pasta should be al dente, which means not quite done. So let that sit another five minutes. Then drain it and let it sit in your sink, but not the side with the two Asian beetles on an expedition.\n6. Look through your cabinets for some tomato sauce. Of course you don't have any. Don't use that cream of mushroom soup, this isn't 1985. Look in your fridge for a half jar of spaghetti sauce. Look at the date on the lid: today should be at least 4 months past that date. Open it up. No mold? Good to go! Dump that on top of the meat.\n7. Add some seasoning. I used Lawry's. Add as much as you think you need to cover up the stank from the meat that sat, I mean seasoned, in your fridge. I also used some Bootleg BBQ sauce, but you could use Boetje's mustard, or some paprika, or if you're from Central MN you could use Heinz ketchup. Stir it up and let it simmer for five minutes.\n8. Add your noodles to the meat sauce. If you did your measurements right, you should have too many damn noodles for the saucepan and you'll have to smoosh the lid down on it to keep the heat in. Stir occasionally so you don't burn the shit out of the bottom, and after ten minutes of that, you're done.\n\nBon Appetite!", "[deleted]"]}

This would honestly be a huge help and would most likely help me actually eat real food.", "hey. not sure if you are still looking at this thread.\nim a full time college student and working part time. i have been eating a lot of fatty stuffs which are fast to cook and result is that im getting fat. it will be greatful if you could suggest me something. keep in mind that im running on a low budget. i do not have any food restrictions but i only have a gas stove to cook. no ovens or microwave. \nthank you.", "i wish you were at my college, i wish i had the movitation to do something like this"]}

My Grandma has been making these for my entire life and recently showed me how she does it. Wanted to share the recipe with you all as it\u2019s super simple and can be filled like any flatbread with a myriad of things like eggs, beef, pickles, etc. Below is a video of me making it, if that\u2019s easier to follow along with:\n\n[Take a look here if interested](https://youtu.be/NUyurWRemRw)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 \u00be Cup Flour\n* \u00be Cup Water\n* 1 tsp Salt\n* 4 Green Onions/Scallions\n* Oil\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1). Add Flour, Salt, and Water in a bowl and mix until a shaggy dough forms\n\n2). Turn that dough out onto a work surface and knead for 5 - 10 mins, or until it looks smooth\n\na). The motions should be to push the dough outward, then pull it back; rotate the ball of dough periodically and repeat the push/pull.\n\n3). Cover the dough and let it relax for 5 - 10 mins\n\n4). Slice Up the scallions into thin rings and set aside\n\n5). Flour the work surface and roll out the dough into a rectangle-ish shape about \u215b inch thick\n\n6). Drizzle oil on the dough and smear it all over the the surface so there are no dry spots\n\n7). Sprinkle the sliced scallions all over the oiled dough\n\n8). Roll up the dough into a long snake\n\n9). Seal the edges by pinching them and tucking under the roll\n\n10). Cut the snake in half and seal the cut edge like you did in step 9\n\n11). Take one of the halves and gently pull it while banging it on the table. Don\u2019t have to be too rough, just stretch out the roll a bit\n\n12). Coil up the roll then tuck the edge under the coil\n\n13). Flatten the disk by rolling it out again, feel free to flip and rotate the disk as you roll it out.\n\nSome scallions will poke through, and this is ok\n\n14). Preheat a pan on medium heat with just a bit of oil. Take some paper towels and spread the oil around the pan like you are trying to clean it\n\n15). Once the oil starts smoking a bit, lower the heat to medium low and add the pancake\n\n16). Cook for 2 mins then flip it over\n\n17). Keep cooking for 2 mins then flipping the pancake until you get some dark brown spots,\n\nlike a leopard\n\n18). Once you get those spots on both sides, you\u2019re done! Cut it up and enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or how it turned out for you if you made it. Would love to hear what you guys think of my Grandma\u2019s recipe!"]}

This keeps the healthful cultures in both of these foods alive.\n* A little miso goes a long way! Use sparingly until you know how much you like.\n* Miso and kimchi will keep for quite a long time if properly stored, preferably in glass containers.\n* These are pretty high-sodium concoctions, so try to get the low sodium versions of any of the above ingredients whenever possible.\n* If there is *any* kind of Asian community in your town, find a local grocery and shop there for the miso, douchi, and kimchi. They tend to be much cheaper there than at places like Whole Foods (total rip-off). Don't worry if they aren't Japanese or Korean. My local source is a Cambodian grocery here in Long Beach that sells American-made low-sodium miso. You can also often find analogs (such as the Korean version of miso, *doenjang*.)

Been trying to challenge myself to   make recipes that are both simple and budget friendly. As a rule, the   dish needs to be 6 ingredients or less and cost under $6 excluding   water, oil, and/or salt. So as my first attempt, I\u2019m going with Lentils!   I like them more than the tried and true beans and rice because dried   lentils are similar in cost to dried beans, but don\u2019t need to be soaked   and cook in way less time; 45 - 60 mins for beans as opposed to 15 -  20  mins for lentils. Also made a video of the whole process.\n\n[Take a Look Here if Interested](https://youtu.be/GKvkCJXQQJ8)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* \u00bd Onion ($0.35)\n* 3 Medium Carrots ($0.30)\n* 3 Celery Stalks ($0.25)\n* 3 Tbsp Oil ($0.12)\n* \u00bc Cup Soy Sauce ($0.19)\n* 2 Cups Lentils ($0.77)\n* 4 Cups Water ($0.00)\n* 2 Tbsp Garlic Powder ($.0.29)\n* Salt to taste ($0.02)\n\n**Total Cost:** $2.28\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Dice the onions, carrots, and celery into even sized pieces\n2. Add the oil to a soup pot and add the diced onion, carrot, celery\n3. Turn the heat onto medium high and stir the vegetables to coat them in oil\n4. Let the vegetables cook and give them the occasional lazy stir until you see browning on the vegetables and bottom of the pot\n5. Add the soy sauce and scrape all the browned bits on the bottom of the pot\n6. Add in the lentils and stir to coat them in oil\n7. Add the water and bring to a gentle simmer, like a flat soda\n8. Add the garlic powder and mix it around\n9. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to a gentle simmer and let it simmer for 10 mins\n10. Check   the water level after those 10 mins and see if more is needed or not.   If so, add a bit of water and continue to simmer for 5 - 10 mins\n11. After   those additional 5 - 10 mins taste a few of the lentils to check for   doneness, take a few samples to ensure they\u2019re all cooked\n12. Once cooked, serve and enjoy!\n\nLet   me know if you give this a shot and how it turns out. Also if there\u2019s   any other dishes you think would fit this 6 for $6 challenge, I would   love to hear about those too!"]}

Like a sausage jacuzzi ;( heck if you drink the water then you\u2019ve basically for that yummy hot ham water from arrested development. \n\nBrown the beef mince in a pot. Use a stainless steel pot to get a fond (bless up babish) and deglaze with vinegar/beer/wine/water but I don\u2019t have one so I didn\u2019t. \n\nChuck in the jar of chili mix. Maybe another time I\u2019ll go in depth about homemade chili but for this I couldn\u2019t be bothered and it turned out just fine. They\u2019re chili cheese dogs for Christ sake. Don\u2019t overthink it. \n\nCut the bun open. Put your sausage in the bun. Hehe. Stick a slice of cheese on it and put in the oven set to broil. Like making cheese on toast. The cheese won\u2019t be fully melted but it helps plus the bun is toasted and the sausage is warmed. \n\nTake the cheesy hotdog out the oven and pour on some chili. Top with chopped chives. \n\nNow. When it comes to mise en place just make sure you have everything ready and organised. \n\nSausages in a pot of water/ or on a plate. \n\nBuns cut open and on an oven tray. \n\nCheese slices peeled and spread out for easy grabbing. \n\nChili in a big pot on the stove. Keep on a low heat. You can\u2019t over cook it\n\nChopped chives/shallots in a bowl for garnish. \n\nTin foil or napkins or plates ready because these will be messy. \n\nI used to avoid doing mise en place because I wanted to avoid any extra washing but it keeps things tidier and it\u2019s super easy to wash up anyways. Just set it all out as if you\u2019re presenting a buffet. Think of the subway sandwich station because that\u2019s basically what this is anyways. "]}

You can either cook the thighs on the bone or cut the meat off the bone. \n\nTypically a recipe will specify what type of chicken to use, if you want it to cook quicker then chop it up into small blocks. Cook at ~180\u00b0C for ~20mins if it's a full breast, keep an eye on it from here as it will depend on the size and shape as to how well it cooks\n\nTypically if the juice from it runs clear then it's cooked but if you're cautious you can just give it a slice through the thickest bit and if it's not pink then you're safe\n\nGet a separate chopping board for RAW (!!!) meat if you've not got one already, most of the time if you get a set there's a red one for you to easily know which is for raw meat", "Get a chicken breast, put the dial at like 3-5 in your stove. Put some oil in a pan, put it on that stove. Set a timer or look at a clock and note the time. Salt this chicken, then set it in the center of the pan and don\u2019t touch it until it is white halfway up the side (or a little more to be safe). \n\nOnce it is, flip it using a spatula or something that can separate the now nicely seared chicken from the pan. Let it go for the same amount of time minus 2-3 minutes. Take it off, let it sit on a plate for like 5 minutes (not because I\u2019m elitist, but because the chicken will continue to cook from carry-over heat). Cut and see if it\u2019s done at it\u2019s thickest point. It can have a pink hue, but can not be glassy or different texture-wise, and the juices should run clear on the plate. This chicken will be juicy af and crispy on the outside too. \n\nNow if you don\u2019t want plain salted chicken, toss some seasoning on it or some random shit, and cook onions/mushrooms in the pan next to it to eat with it. Dry as shit? Cook it shorter on the second side. Burnt skin but raw middle? Turn down the heat next time. \n\nIf you\u2019re like me and the chicken breasts you find are like 3-4 inches thick, look up \u201chow to butterfly chicken breast.\u201d With a couple easy cuts, it essentially lets you \u201cunfold\u201d the chicken breast into a thinner, wider piece of meat that will cook evenly and easily. Don\u2019t be the roommate that scorches some dry ass cubed chicken in a pan and smokes up the apartment. If it is smoking up bad, then turn the heat down because your oil is burning while you\u2019re cooking. Enjoy! This is long but none of it is hard to do and you won\u2019t regret it.", "Sometimes you can find a big bag (close to 4 lbs) of tenders at a grocery store for about $10. If you can find them, buy them. Typically they have a bit of fat that needs to be trimmed out, but otherwise they are very useful for recipes that call for both breast or thigh meat. \n\nThighs are cheap too, and typically will be a little juicer/more flavorful than a breast. However, they have less meat per cut, in most cases.\n\nI personally like chicken in just about any form. You can saut\u00e9 it, bake it, boil it, slow cook it, grill it - whatever form of cooking you are most comfortable with or can access the easiest - and it will PROBABLY turn out well. It does take a bit of practice to learn how to cook it well, but as long as you cook out the pink you should be okay. Buying a digital meat thermometer might be helpful to you as well- they usually include the ranges that each meat needs to reach before being done. \n\nAs for the cutting, it just takes some practice. Get a chef knife, but don\u2019t feel the need to spring for anything fancy. Mine was $5 at Walmart, has a colorful plastic handle, and is probably the most sturdy and comfortable knife I\u2019ve ever used. You\u2019ll also want a decent cutting board (preferably with a gutter-type cutout for juices and some kind of rubber grips on the bottom/a separate mat to set it on). These tools are great to have on hand for chicken prep, but also for general day to day cooking. Look for a separate cutting board for veggies though, probably. It\u2019s easier to have 2 than it is to wash and disinfect your chicken cutting board before prepping the rest of your meal. Use the same specifications in purchasing that one too; the grips are just good for the safety of your fingers, and for speed and quality of cuts made. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure how to prepare it, go look at the grill seasonings and marinades in your grocery store. Most of them are really good and will explain how to prepare it on the packaging. If you want a recipe for a meal, or something a little more complex than seasoning alone, search for chicken recipes on Pinterest. Even just using those recipes to read about cook times in different means of cooking would help you out greatly. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t cover something, let me know. From one college student to another, good luck. Cooking can be a great stress reliever and very enjoyable, but it\u2019s a little bit stressful to get yourself started. ", "Look all you need is some seasoning like McCormick rotisserie chicken seasoning as well as Goya seasoning. Then you need to chop the chicken pieces with some olive oil on the stove and cook it there for a little. Then you can eat it with rice or with hot sauce or whatever ", "Get large \"family\" packs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. As soon as you get home, take them all out and put each one individually in a freezer/Ziploc bag. That should be a serving size for a decent dinner. Once you're ready to cook, take one bag out, make sure its sealed, and throw it in a bowl of warm\\-hot water and let it defrost (about 10 minutes). \n\nTo cut, lay it down lengthwise, put your palm on the top, and use your knife to cut parallel to the plane of the table. \n\nIf you need any recipes, PM me!"]}

{"title": "Picky eater who's looking for healthy recipes...please help!", "selftext": "Hello fellow Redditors! I need your help. Soon I will have my first college apartment (where I will be responsible for my own cooking). Right now I eat pretty unhealthily (I eat fast food at least 3-4 times a week) and I'm looking to change that for this upcoming school year. However, I am EXTREMELY picky! Most healthy recipes I find online include things I can't bring myself to eat...anyone know of any good recipes for picky eaters? Some foods I don't like include soups, sauces, chowders, tomatoes, peppers, and dressings (there's more but I can't think of them right now). Thanks for the help, Reddit!\n\nEDIT: since someone suggested it below, here are some foods I like: seafood, chicken, broccoli, fruits...and unhealthy foods of course. I've tried asparagus and I actually like it...pastas (without sauce), breads. I know that's not a lot to work with, but it's hard to think of all the things you like in one go. Sorry!

Find things that you like from loads of cultures. Maybe try to like new things. Other than that. Baked potatoes with fillings. Butternut squash frittas with some cheese. Things using cheaper meats like pork shoulder, chicken legs and turkey. Sausage recipes like toad in the hole or casseroles, or add them to pasta and sauce. Eggs. Eggs are the best. Omelettes, fried eggs, boiled eggs, poached eggs, eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs, deviled eggs, egg salad, egg mayonnaise (works with jacket potatoes). On top of that, every culture has cheap quick recipes that you can learn pretty easily. Things like a stirfry , fajitas, ramen, jap chae, the list goes on. For cheap things look at beans and pulses, things like chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils etc. All cheap, all have decent protein and flavour. Get excited by food, explore it with hungry eyes and you will find so much to enjoy. One extra tip, acid makes flavours pop. Lemon juice, lime juice and vinegar are used for basically everything. Learn which one goes in what dishes.", "Do you like rice? I'm a poor college student and what I do is buy a $1 box of paella rice mix, add 2 more cups of Uncle Ben's rice, then follow the directions on the box. It'll make enough food for 4-5 days if you just add more chicken or sausage. You can also put in seafood if you want. It's really healthy, filling, and cheap. Also add in diced onions and garlic and you'll need a giant saucepan to cook it in", "Also you say you don't like soups, but they are so varied. A broccoli and Stilton soup is so different from a garlic and lentil, which are so different from a Vietnamese Pho. Don't rule something out if it is similar to something you don't like :)", "Try this - we call it stone soup because you start with nothing, add in vegetables and meat that you like and follow the basic recipe - bingo - soup! http://www.motherwouldknow.com/journal/its-a-beautiful-day-to-make-soup.html\n\nOr for a pasta version, try this pasta primavera - very simple and use only what you like. Cutting up asparagus would work well. http://www.motherwouldknow.com/journal/pasta-primavera.html", "invest in a rice maker that has a steam basket. In said basket here are a few favorites you can to and add to the rice (and maybe some soy)\n-Broccoli and cauliflower\n-Green Cabbage and Potato (season with dill (reduced gasiness from cabbage) and parsley (goes well with potato), maybe a little olive oil. \n-can black bean and carrots (Killer!!!)\n-Tuna in rice (don't steam tuna)\n\nAlso crock-pot is nice to have. You can make chicken in it. Take some boneless skinless breasts and cook with rotela and brown rice (added like an hour to hour half prior to being done) then dollop into tortilla, add cheese. If you master this you can roll and store in baggies and nuke later. Or just make enough and store in container, but more tortillas later and prep. \n\nAlso, growing your taste buds would be pretty sweet too and not be such a picky eater, jsut saying. My wife is a damned picky eater, and she ends up getting over it and indulging in my awesomeness.  \n "]}

Ideally, I'd like to find 3 or 4 different smoothie recipes for breakfast that use some of the same ingredients to reduce cost. Same idea with the salads - I'd like to find 3 or 4 with overlapping ingredients. And if there are any smoothie/salad ingredients that overlap, that would be even better. \n\nIf anyone has budget-friendly advice for these meals, it would be greatly appreciated!

This will ensure you get the vitamins you need and make planning for meals a lot easier. \n\nThe next thing I would do is think of veggies you like to eat. This will be your baseline for weekly grocery shopping. The thing is I don't know what you like to eat so it's hard for me to say what would work for you, but  for example, some of the things I get every week are: Potatoes, green peppers, carrots, and onions. I also get tortillas, shredded cheese, milk, eggs, rice, spaghetti, and pasta sauce. \nHere are some things I make with that (because although I love pasta, I don't like eating it every night)\n\nMini pizza: Tortilla with pasta sauce and shredded cheese. Add onion or green pepper for toppings. Toast in toaster oven or regular oven.\n\nStuffed green peppers: Rice + pasta sauce + seasoning + onion mixed together, stuffed in a pepper, and baked with shredded cheese in the oven\n\nBreakfast-for-dinner1: 2 eggs with diced potatoes (potatoes are fried in a pan mixed with green pepper + onion + italian seasoning)\n\nBreakfast-for-dinner 2- Egg burritos: Scrambled eggs w/ green pepper + onion, wrapped in a tortilla\n\nPotato pancake: Shredded potato mixed with diced onion and very finely chopped carrot. Mix in egg to help it form into patties, and fry. \n\nCarrot Salad: If I plan to eat this one week, I buy oranges that week too. Its Shredded carrot, diced oranges + minced onion, with a dressing of oil, salt, and lemon juice. It sounds like an odd combination but its amazing\n\nYou can also store unused ends and peels of veggies in the freezer to turn into vegetable broth for soup. \n\nNow for some of the things that you specifically mentioned in your post\nJust get milk and strawberries/blueberries/banana. When the fresh fruit is on sale at the store, I stock up and buy a lot of it and it gets me through several months because I immediately freeze it. (Except for banana, I just buy that each week and peel and dice the banana and then freeze it for the week because its less expensive so I dont have to wait for it to go on sale. With just those 3 fruits you can make smoothies with just 1 fruit, 2 fruits, or 3 fruits. Thatll give you some variety without having to buy tons of different fruits. \n\nSnacks: Raw veggies are always a great snack. I eat carrots and green peppers w/ salad dressing for dip (usually bleu cheese dressing but I know not a lot of people like that. Ranch works great for veggie dip) \n\nUnfortunately, I don't really have experience with salads other than the potato salad, broccoli salad, and carrot salad I make (let me know if you want the recipes for the potato or broccoli salad). I don't really like regular salads with lettuce and stuff because like you, I have a hard time coming up with things to put it in. My only suggestion would be get lettuce, tomato, carrot, green pepper, and cucumber. That makes a good salad and except for the lettuce and tomato, all the other veggies can be used as snacks. \n\nNow, if you're a meat eater, a simple way to add meat into your diet is to meat sauce for pasta and add meat to the stuffed green peppers. \n\nThats all I can think of for now. \nSorry this was long. I hope it gave you some ideas. \n", "Oh also, one other thing I forgot that I like to make is fried rice. I cook carrots and onion in a pan, then I take rice (that I have already made) and add it to the pan. I add some soysauce and seasoning, then after Ive cooked the rice mixture a bit, I push everything over to one side of the pan and cook a couple scrambled eggs that I then add to the rice mixture. You can add other veggies like corn, green pepper, or peas if you like those. "]}

You can check out the many cooking subreddits to learn. \n\n\nDoing most cooking at home, eating fruits, vegetables, rice, pasta, chicken, eggs, etc, without a lot of snacks/soda/premade stuff I'd say $50 per week is more than enough most weeks.

And these particular slices are about three quarters of an inch step. You want a thick bread for this. I'm just using this regular sandwich bread you can use brioche. If you want or French bread, you know, whatever kind of bread that you like, regular bread makes the best French toast to me. Now get a frying pan over medium-high heat,\u00a0 add about a teaspoon of vegetable oil as well as just a little thumb of butter. Now the reason I add both vegetable oil and butter is because butter has a natural nonstick property to it, but the vegetable oil raises the burning point of the butters so The butter doesn't burn . \n\nReally don't want burned butter on your French toast. So that's why I do both. And you want to make sure that your butter and oil are hot before you add in your first piece of French toast. Otherwise, your French toast is going to stick and you don't want that. And you know, when it's ready. When the solids, the milk solids in the butter start to Brown. That is your French toast is ready. \n\nflip the other side of the French toast over.\nNow, a lot of recipes for french toast call for you to soak the bread. I do not like soaked bread for french toast, but if you do, no problem I don't I like my French toast custardy.\nI'm just going to let this go for a couple minutes until it gets nice and golden brown on the bottom, don't be tempted to move your bread around, let the heat do its work,\u00a0 make sure that it is nice and golden brown, and then you can go ahead and remove that off to the plate.\nand just a little bit more butter and vegetable oil to your pan between each slice and continue, frying up the rest of your French toast. \n\nAnd then you can go ahead and pour some Delicious maple syrup right over the FrenchToast. If you're feeling extra, decadent dust the top with a little bit of powder, you can serve these with fried eggs and bacon on the side, or if you want just like a little bowl of fresh fruit. Would be delicious. french toast is a simple meal."]}

Or you like Doraemon and Japanese foods? Or you like both. Try it out this cute mini chocolate Dorayaki recipe. It\u2019s super easy to make and I have all of the important notes for you in the bottom of this recipe.\n\n[For full recipe with visual instructions please watch it HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNaRFAJFQD0)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 large eggs\n* 100g all purpose flour\n* 30g cocoa powder\n* 70g sugar\n* 15g honey\n* 1 tsp baking powder\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 60ml water\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Crack 2 eggs to a big bowl\n2. Add 70g sugar and 15g honey to the bowl\n3. Whisk it well until sugar and honey are fully dissolved\n4. Add 1 tsp of vanilla extract and mix it well again\n5. Put a sifter on top of the bowl and add 100g all purpose flour, 30g cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder\n6. Sift all of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients\n7. Mix the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Be gentle so the cocoa powder don\u2019t get to everywhere ;)\n8. Once the dry ingredients are incorporated to the wet ingredients. Add 60ml water and whisk until the batter is smooth\n9. Wrap the batter bowl and let it chill in the fridge for 20 minutes\n10. After 20 minutes, heat up your non stick pan under low heat for a few minutes (3-4 minutes)\n11. Use a small spoon, scoop the batter and gently drop it to the non stick pan\n12. Make mini dorayaki about 5-6 cm(2-2,5 inches) or make it the size you desire\n13. Cook under low heat until you see the bubbles on the surface pop and stay open then flip the pancakes\n14. Cook for another minute or until the dorayaki cake do not stick to the pan anymore\n15. Put the chocolate dorayaki to a pan and let it cool down\n16. Spread Nutella in the middle on one side of the pancakes, gently spread a thin layer around the edges of it\n17. Gently pinch the edge together to seal the dorayaki\n18. Enjoy\n\n**Important notes**\n\n1. Your pan need to be a real good non stick pan so the pancakes won\u2019t stick. If it\u2019s perfectly non stick, you don\u2019t need to use oil. Just cook it under low heat\n2. You can make any size of dorayaki as you wish, just adjust the cook time accordingly to the size\n3. I use Nutella as my chocolate filling but you can use chocolate ganache or any other filling.\n4. After you\u2019re done making these chocolate dorayaki. You can store it in a food container in the fridge and it\u2019d be good to use in a few days.\n\nI hope you like the recipe and enjoy this soft and chocolaty dorayaki ;)"]}

Here\u2019s a recipe for Shakshuka. A dish that\u2019s very budget friendly and can be eaten any time, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Normally it can include more spices, but I wanted to keep the ingredient list under 6 items (not including water, oil or salt). This is for a challenge of making dishes with up to 6 ingredients that costs less than $6. Made a video of myself cooking it with instructions.  \n[Take a look here if interested](https://youtu.be/7jcfcFrvMTk): \n\n  \n**Ingredients:**  \n\\- \u00bd Medium Onion ($0.35)  \n\\- 1 Red Bell Pepper ($0.99)  \n\\- 1 \u00bd tsp Paprika ($0.08)  \n\\- 1 \u00bd tsp Cumin ($0.03)  \n\\- 1 tsp Salt ($0.16)  \n\\- 28oz Can Diced Tomatoes ($1.99)  \n\\- 6 Eggs ($0.85)  \n**Total: $4.45**\n\n  \n**Directions:**  \n1). Dice the onion and pepper  \n2). Add the onions and some oil to a pan on medium high heat, cook until the onions get some golden brown color  \n3). Add the diced peppers and the spice with a drizzle of more oil, cook until the peppers are softened  \n4). Add the can of tomatoes and a but of water (use the water to rinse out the can) and bring to pan to a boil  \n5). Once boiling, lower the heat to a gentle simmer and let it cook down uncovered  \n6). In the meantime crack the eggs. It\u2019s best to crack the eggs one at a time in one bowl and pour it afterwards into another, larger bowl. This way if you get a broken yolk, you can discard if desired  \n7). Once the Vegetable Mixture/Sauce has cooked down into a thick salsa and you can draw a line with a spoon on the bottom of the pan, make indentations in the sauce for where the eggs will go  \n8). Pour the eggs into those indentations, slowly and carefully to ensure they pour our one at a time  \n9). Cover and let simmer for 4 mins for runny eggs, longer for more firm one  \n10). Serve it up and enjoy!\n\n  \nLet me know if you decide to give this a shot and how it goes for you!"]}

They flavor differently. You might need more pink salt than you would iodized but if your diet is low in iodine, the iodized might help to supplement it. Otherwise, pink or sea all the way.) \n\nPepper. Black pepper grinder is best. Try to get one that can be unscrewed and refilled so you aren\u2019t \u201cthrowing out the baby with the bathwater\u201devery month or so (so to speak.) White pepper can be bought ground/powdered and it is still potent but beneficial for classical recipes or those where you don\u2019t want the specks, yet want the pepper flavor. White pepper can be powerful so use judiciously.\n\nGarlic and onion powder. (They add the flavor without needing to chop onions and garlic all the time or if you are in a pinch or don\u2019t like the texture of onions and garlic. Helps with spoilage if you aren\u2019t using garlic and onion all the time.)\n\nSoy sauce. Just a splash can add a nice umami to dishes that you wouldn\u2019t think could use soy sauce. (Spaghetti sauces/bolognese, mushroom or beef-based soups, Swedish meatballs or stroganoff. Earthy dishes can be improved with a little soy sauce.  But it is all according to your personal taste or preference.)\n\nA seasoning salt: Slap Yo Mama, Tony\u2019s Chachere\u2019s, Lawry\u2019s (if you don\u2019t mind the celery salt/taste), Old Bay for seafood (also has celery salt/seed), a standard barbecue seasoning (for just about any meat), and poultry seasoning if you want the more classical blend that would suit poultry/roast chicken.\n\nI prepare a lot of regional/international foods so I find these blends work for said regions/styles/inspired-by foods\u2026\n\nCajun/Creole: the holy trinity: bell peppers/green if you have to choose, onions, celery \n\nMexican/Tex-Mex: cilantro, green onions, cumin, chili powder, onions, garlic, cinnamon (sometimes), oregano (sometimes), jalape\u00f1o peppers with or without seeds and white membrane (more capsaicin here so if you want the flavor without the heat, remove these and wash your hands thoroughly/don\u2019t touch eyes, nose, mucus membrane until your hands are clean, and Serrano is a good small pepper to use with caution if you don\u2019t like a lot of heat. It is small but mighty!)\n\nAsian: cilantro, green onion/scallions, soy sauce, garlic and onion powder, ground ginger, sesame oil ( a little goes a long way!!) Palm sugar (or dark brown sugar if you can\u2019t find palm sugar), fish sauce, gochujang (or ground red pepper (a little goes a long way!!)+ rice wine vinegar/white vinegar+and little brown sugar, toasted sesame seeds, rice wine vinegar, mirin can be good to have at times. Some dishes might use peanuts, basil, mint, coconut milk, lemongrass, and you might see some crossover between Latin and Mexican spices and spices used in India/Bharat, Morocco and other Northern African which might see you use: cumin, coriander, turmeric (if you want to get the full benefits of curcumin in turmeric which lowers blood glucose or helps to stabilize it, add black pepper which helps bioavailability and use with a fattier, unctuous dish as fat helps increase bioavailability as well), cardamom( which is also a good addition to coffee if you follow Ayurveda) and to add to saut\u00e9ed apples/pies, spice cakes, or gingerbread, clove, garam masala, nutmeg, cinnamon, mustard seed, fennel\u2026\n\nItalian: sage. (If you have ground pork and no Italian sausage or other ground meats, the addition of sage will do), basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, red pepper flakes, extra virgin olive oil and olive oil with good flavor when you might want to impart the taste of olive oil. \n\nEuropean: dried or fresh dill, chives, rosemary, fennel, ginger, marjoram, tarragon, parsley, oregano.\n\nFrench: might include some of the European and Italian herbs/spices and saffron (also crossover spice used in many regional and international cuisines from Paella of Spain or Saffron Chicken Korma or maybe Zafrani rice/pulao of India. It\u2019s expensive but sometimes grocery stores might have the spices on clearance that aren\u2019t selling well and you can get them for a great price.)\n\nI tried to cover a lot of options as I don\u2019t know your plans for cooking but I sometimes having a few from each category without being redundant (getting ground fennel or fennel seed and not getting anise or tarragon might be sufficient to get the warm licorice flavor, for example, or getting coriander in place of cilantro but maybe keeping something like tajin which has the cilantro and lime flavor for quick addition to mashed avocados for guacamole.) \n\nAlso, better than bouillon is a great thing to have on hand for broths or seasoning anything that requires a specific flavor profile if you haven\u2019t time to cook a stock or to source all of the costly ingredients.\n\nTomato paste is a great thickener to keep on hand in the fridge or in small cans. And if your spaghetti sauce or any sauce with pasta is thin, save your pasta water and add a little at a time and cook down to thicken your sauce. If you haven\u2019t a lot of time, pots, or stove space you can use a large microwaveable dish with water and salt (enough to season not a cloying amount) and boil your pasta in the microwave while making your sauce or anything else on the stovetop. Check it every 10-15 mins at first and every five after until it is done to your liking. There should be enough water in the container to cover the pasta by an inch or so. I\u2019ve cooked long spaghetti in a long Tupperware and it has worked great. Some pastas cook for shorter times and may need to be checked more often for doneness. Also don\u2019t forget about carryover cooking. Food still cooks for 5-20 mins or so after being removed from heat source or while resting so be mindful of that as well. \n\nON COOKING by Harold McGee is a great resource for the science of every aspect of cooking and THE DESSERT BIBLE by Christopher Kimball (from America\u2019s Test Kitchen) is another amazing resource for baking. All in all, trust yourself and be fearless and keep a lot of tasting spoons to taste as you go. \n\nHappy Cooking!\u263a\ufe0f", "No problem! \n(Tasting spoons/washing the utensil used for tasting with soap and water may not always be a necessity when cooking for yourself, but\u2014aside from food safety and sanitation\u2014when you\u2019re making cream-based sauces or soups/chowders, gravies, anything thickened in some way, the acidity of saliva could cause the sauce/soup to breakdown which makes the final product watery.

Baking powder is activated (mostly) by heat and (a bit) by moisture while baking soda is activated by an acid so keep in mind when baking with baking soda or experimenting to add an acid (e.g. lemon juice, white or apple cider vinegar, buttermilk, or any cocoa powder that isn\u2019t Dutch-processed/alkalized thus neutralizing the acidity making the cocoa powder much darker, but also needing baking powder for the chemical leavening.) If you ever have any questions, feel free to post here and I\u2019ll answer them to the best of my knowledge. \ud83c\udf73\ud83e\udd58\ud83c\udf6a"]}

Also, never buy reduced unless you plan to use it the day of purchase or the day after - they're going out so they want to sell them fast, which is fine, but that reduced sticker is only in your favor as long as the meat is good, otherwise you lost money that could have been spent elsewhere and this is not the economy to play with.\n\nBuy fruit last unless you eat it most or know for certain you will eat them before they ruin - it's expensive and goes bad quicker than most other things. Most berries and cut fruits last longer in air-tight glass.\n\nBe the asshole to pull bread, milk, and other perishables from the back - if the store you go to follows food safety, the ones with the later date on them will be in the back.\n\nRemember that it's okay to buy frozen heat-to-eat meals. They may stay in the freezer for a while, but there will come a day that you're too tired (physically or mentally) or too pressed for time to cook. A lot of them have your staple foods for cheap and fed is better than unfed.\n\nIt helps to make a list of meals you'd like to eat, but keep them simple enough that the ingredients can be made into something else. I grabbed the ingredients for an authentic curry, but I never made it and don't know how else to use a lot of them - the ingredients are still sitting a month later, and I had to buy more because I never had the time to make it and the one day I had time, I wasn't in the mood to eat it.\n\nKeep in mind that, in the freezer, milk and cured meats last 1 month; butter, fish, cooked meats, soups, stews, and casseroles last 2-3; frozen dinners, minced meat, and shredded cheese 4; uncooked meats (save mince) last about 6; and raw vegetables up to 12, but are best if used by 8.\n\nIf you decide to do something with bone-in meat, if you take out the bones before cooking, you can boil them with salt and vegetables to make stocks for soups - a life saver for when you do get sick, but they have to be kept in glass or else you'll ruin them (maybe not actually, but they will taste like the container).\n\nI hope this helps!", "SPAGHETTI SQUASH! I am a Junior in college now and me and my friends are obsessed with this recipe! We moved in 2 weeks ago and have had it like 5 times!\n\nIngredients:\n\n1. Half a spagetti squash\n\n2. Boursin Cheese\n\n3. Cherry Tomatos\n\n4. Spinach\n\nPut the spaghetti squash and cherry tomatos in the oven for 40 mins at 400F. Then melt the boursin cheese and spinach on a pan (You may need to add half and half if the consistency is too thick) and add to the inside of your cooked squash. Then with a fork mash the inside of the squash and it turns into spaghetti like noodles. This recipe is healthy and such a staple I hope you use it!!"]}

{"title": "Best appliance?", "selftext": "Hi! For black friday my parents have agreed to buy me another appliance I can use to cook from my dorm room (already have an air fryer).  \n\n\n I was wondering what would open be the best between a pressure cooker and a mini convection over/ bigger air fryer (that would replace the ninja foodi I have atm).  \n The oven would allow me to bake pasta/bread/snacks etc (the main drawback of the air fryer, the two zones make it impossible to cook something other than a cookie in it).   \n\n\nBUT the pressure cooker would allow me to make rice, soup, curries and chilis which would reduce my grocery bills (I currently eat a piece of meat + veggies cooked in the air fryer). Drawback of the pressure cooker is that I still can't bake and will likely end up buying a ton of muffins lol.  (I buy like 10$ worth of muffins weekly, although it's paid in cash with old tips from a previous fast food job so not actually in my budget)  \n\n\nI do have access to a kitchen, but there's a lot of stealing and it's fucking gross most of the time (There's like two girls on a floor of 40)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecooking/comments/1799r7s/best_appliance/", "created_utc": 1697472877.0, "score": 2, "author": "NukeNukedEarth", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/collegecooking/comments/1799r7s/best_appliance/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["You can actually bake stuff with a pressure cooker!

We\u2019ve all found that meal planning has really helped us eat better and save money. After using several recipe sourcing, grocery shopping, inventory / pantry management, and meal planning apps we realized that all the apps out there seem to only do part of the job.   \n\nOur goal is to generate personalized meal plans that consider your budgetary, dietary, taste, and cooking preferences, track and incorporate ingredients you have on hand to minimize waste, and generate easy to use grocery lists that don\u2019t break the bank.  \n\nCheck us out at [www.budgeat.app](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts) and if you\u2019re interested download the app to give us a try! We're still early in our journey so just having more people try the app and provide feedback is immensely helpful.

I know some people who eat microwave frozen meals, they aren\u2019t my favorite but still better then nothing. I also like to get small russet potatoes and make cheesy potatoes. Really a lot of different options with this one too \n\nRice cooker : pretty straight forward. Rice can go with alot if different things i have it often. I have also made small proteins of Soup in mine. One of my Favorites meals is Tuna and Rice. I will even buy seaweed so i make make little like tuna roll type things\n\nElectric kettle: Boil eggs in the electric Kettle they are a good source of protein. You can also use this a for anything that requires boiling water. expect for Pasta i haven\u2019t done it before but i don\u2019t think it will work well. \n\nA Electric Stillet: This is allowed in the kitchen of my dorm, we don\u2019t have stove tops. you can really make anything with this one some of my favorites is fried eggs and Fried Rice. Grilled cheese i is an easy one \n\nA Crock Pot : i actually have alot of things i make in this. Easy thing to throw together the night before and cook during the day especially when your planning to stay in your dorm for most the day. \n\nFor Ingredients, i use the salad station for alot. We also have a Sandwich station. The side dishes at my school Arent always horrible so occasionally i grab things from there. If you don\u2019t want/ can\u2019t go to the store to shop insta cart works but they tend to up charge things. One of the easiest things to get is a rotisserie chicken then cut it up and use it to add to meals during the week.

{"title": "My take on meal prep.", "selftext": "**What is meal prep?**\n\nMeal prep is cooking food in advance. This could be by making extra of your dinner so you will have planned leftovers. Or it could be to the extreme of planning and cooking all of your meals for a week in advance. I personally have been meal prepping for about 2 years now, and I don\u2019t think I will ever not do it again since how much it helps during the week.\u00a0\n\n**Why Should I meal prep?**\n\nThe number one reason why you should meal prep is that it saves a ton of time. Instead of cooking 3 meals a day that takes about 30 minutes each, you can bear the burden of cooking for a few hours all at once, and then not have to worry about cooking for a while. All you have to do is heat your food up and you\u2019re set to go.\u00a0Another great benefit of meal prepping is that you can prepare healthy meals in advance. If you already have healthy meals made, you will be less tempted to stop for a fast-food burger or something else that you really don\u2019t want. You will be able to get a great meal, very quickly, and feel great about yourself afterward.\u00a0Meal prep is also a great way to save money. If you plan out all your meals, there is a small chance that you will have to waste much food in the process. Also, a lot of foods that go great meal prepping, can end up being super cheap while still tasting amazing,\n\n**Is meal prep for me?**\n\nIf you have a very busy lifestyle, are constantly on the go, or spend long days away from your house, meal prep will be great for you. As long as you have a few hours to sacrifice for cooking, you will do great preparing your meals. I know many people who work 9-5\u2019s who love meal prepping for the fact that they can just grab food quickly to take to work. And personally, as a college student love meal prepping because it allows me to grab food fast after class, and have more time for homework, and fun.\u00a0\n\n**What foods can I prep?**\n\nThere is a ton of food that you can prepare, you just have to be careful not to keep it in your fridge too long, or else it could go bad. Usually, the expiration of prepared food is about 5 days. This is usually how long I plan for, and I\u2019ve never had any problems with food going bad. Some of the best foods to prepare are:\n\nProteins:\n\n* Chicken\n* Ground Beef/ Turkey\n* Fish\n* Lentils\n\nCarbs:\n\n* Rice\n* Pasta\n* Vegetables (Steamed broccoli, carrots, chopped spinach, sweet potato, etc..)\n\nFats:\n\n* Olive oil (goes great with pasta)\n* Cheese\n\n**How do I start meal prepping?**\n\nThe best way to get started meal prepping is to just hop in and experiment. You will learn fast, and before you know it you\u2019ll be an expert, and you\u2019ll be eating healthy all week long without the extra stress of constantly cooking.

In a large bowl, add in 160 grams / 3/4cup of brown sugar , 80 grams/1cup of white sugar and a pinch of salt, whisk to combine. Now add in the melted butter in a slow stream and whisk until no brown sugar lumps remain ( bring melted butter to room temp).\n\nThen add in 1 large whole egg +1 egg yolk. The extra egg yolk adds richness, soft tenderness, and binds the dough Whisk until the sugar is dissolved and you get a lighter colour. Finally add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\n\nIn a separate bowl measure in 200 grams / 1+1/4 cups AP\u00a0flour and 1 teaspoon of baking soda whisk and set aside. Pour the flour mix into the wet ingredients gradually \u2013 just add in half of the flour in first and mix until incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chunks into your dough. They may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them. Use an ice-cream scooper and fill it with cookie dough and then place on the lined baking trays. Make sure to leave space in between so they have room tospread while cooking. Bake the cookies for 13-15 minutes. The cookies will look very soft and underbaked. They will continue to bake on the baking tray. \n\nAllow to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes\u00a0before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely."]}

Put green cabbage and red cabbage in each bowl to to soak and wash the cabbages.\n3. Thinly sliced 1 large mushroom and put it on a bowl aside\n4. Slice 50g sausages and a quarter of a medium onion\n5. In a small pan, put in a little bit of oil to saut\u00e9 the mushroom until it\u2019s soft\n6. Crack 3 large eggs, beat them well\n7. Pour the beaten eggs to our red and green cabbage and mix them well together\n8. Heat a non stick pan under low heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and spread them evenly on the surface of the pan\n9.

I have two types of cabbages so I like to mix them together. If you don\u2019t have either red or green cabbage, just make it with one type of cabbage is fine\n\n3. The toppings is totally depend on your creativity. The sausage is optional, it's not a must. Go out and try it with your favourite toppings.\n\nHave fun making this awesome cabbage recipe!"]}
