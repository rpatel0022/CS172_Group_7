Considering things like labor cost, printing cost, and packaging, it's really not that expensive but compared to other \"postcard\" sized prints on Etsy, it seems so expensive.

I put on an art show in Austin, TX almost ten years ago and didn't recoup my investment in sales. It was something I'd never done before, and I had a great time doing it. The actual prints were a wonder to hold. I loved seeing what has only been digital put into a physical form. Plus all the unsold pieces were enough to decorate a hip local coffee shop for a month. It still costs money though.\n\nI don't know what the kids are doing now, but a Society6 or similar does on-demand printing on a number of different items. Your proceeds are small compared to the cost of the item though.\n\nIf you live in a larger city, look into printers in your area. It's not uncommon to find printers that can print in seven different colors straight on to canvas. If you have a relationship with them, it could fit into your Etsy idea.\n\nI think your products are beautiful and wish you success!"]}

{"title": "Does imported \"authentic\" foreign delicacy such as Turkish Delights not mean its tasty even made back at home?", "selftext": "My store started selling Turkish delights. The item is basically sold in Turkish and there is a small English print saying Made in Turkey. I always heard Turkish delight as being very hyped as out of this world sweetly delicious so I bought it. It was very very very bland and did not taste sweet at all despite on its Turkish box there also being a few printed words \"made out of real oranges\", \"Imported from Ankara\" and \"made authentically\" (though the rest of the box is in Turkish excepting the \"Made in Turkey\" tiny print and a few foreign European languages).\n\nI was pretty disappointed. With that said the labels claiming to have been made in Turkey in authentic methods and imported into the West made me wonder. If a food is supposedly made in another country and shipped over to your local supermarket (esp with claims of authenticity), does that not automatically mean it will taste good?\n\nI'm about to buy some expensive French wine thats been shipped at the local ABC store made in authentic methods and shipped from a farm in southern France. French wine gets all the hype thats good. I am worried about wasting money on a bad experience like with the Turkish Delight so should I be worried?\n\nTo the main gist of the question...... Does say authentic Bratwurst shipped in a jar from Germany does not automatically mean it will be the best Bratwurst I ever ate?

{"title": "How Come People Were Willing To Kill Each Other In The Past Over Delicious Foods? Even As Far As Mere Condiments Like Food Spices? Was Food That Terrible Back Than?", "selftext": "I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken, and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living. The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......\n\nA bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.\n\nIn addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which \"Ninja Chefs\" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. \n\nThe project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.\n\nThese two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.\n\nThe first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. \n\nAnd what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.\n\nHell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!\n\nIn addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:\n\n\"Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death\".\n\nHe explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.\n\nHell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.\n\nI am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?\n\nCan anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!\n\nWhat is the logic behind this? Why did historical peoples act this way?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodart/comments/cbmfz8/how_come_people_were_willing_to_kill_each_other/", "created_utc": 1562792702.0, "score": 1, "author": "SaturnineSasuke", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/foodart/comments/cbmfz8/how_come_people_were_willing_to_kill_each_other/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I admit you had me in the first half."]}

I understand Europe's colder climate often kills of worms and germs associated with pig diseases. But what about Latin America where half of the world's Christian population live in and traditionally had pork as a common meat because of its ease in raising as livestock? Latin America often reach the average heats found in desert countries (and often surpass it!) but it also even has the added problems of humid and wet environment perfect for bacteria to thrive in! Yet no on there gets sick from pig diseases such as trichinosis!\n\nIf the scientific theory behind Islam and Judaism's prohibition of pork is because of diseases, why doesn't South America, traditionally a hotbed of Catholicism and pork cuisine, suffer from the diseases ancient Hebrews and Muslims often got from eating pork (which led to the prohibition in the first place)?\n\nI mean the theory is that its the hot environment of the deserts of the Middle East that caused trichinosis and other pork related diseases because it made it a thriving environment for worms and germs to grow in pigs as well as the stuff pigs ate in the deserts.
