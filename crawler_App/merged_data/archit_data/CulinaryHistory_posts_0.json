{"title": "Rosehip Electuary (late 15th c.)", "selftext": "Today, I\u2019ll talk a little about an experiment I made to prepare my lecture for my medieval club\u2019s \u2018online university\u2019 event. Based on a North German recipe from the late fifteenth century, a sweet and spicy preparation of rosehips:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssb0wr5ivsee1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11b854c53e1b0f19116766e67a302e35d38040d7\n\n***12 Item if you would make an electuary of rosehips (wypen), pick them around (lit.: between) Our Lady\u2019s Day \u2019der lateren\u2019 (?) eight days before or eight days after, as you choose. Cut them in two and take out the stones (seeds). When the stones have been removed and (the rosehips) have been cleaned, boil them in wine or in mead and pound them in a mortar with the same cooking liquid. Pass them through a cloth. Take pounded rice as much as you need for this (quantity). And boil the same with honey and with its own cooking liquid and with good spices, with cloves, with ginger and with good pepper. Boil it (down) as thickly as you can. And put it into clean white cups. And put it forth.***\n\nThis recipe from the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf) describes what South German cookery texts know as a [latwerge](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/13/quince-electuary-after-walter-ryff/), a sweet, thick concoction of fruit, sweetener, and more or less medicinal material. It uses the Latin term electuarium for this. Electuaria were originally a way of administering medical drugs. The term means literally \u2018something meant to be licked\u2019, usually plant juices cooked with honey and mixed with various drugs for the patient to lick up. By the 1400s, electuaries had left the medical sphere to become culinary luxuries. We have recipes mentioning them added to sauces, mustard, and porridges. This is ultimately the origin of modern jams and marmalades, though it is still a long way off from the recipe used here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r4i34ojvsee1.jpg?width=165&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79029b7df0ef9f35569df298362dbc4033f3691c\n\nWe do not have many recipes using rosehips in the medieval corpus though they must have been available widely. Today, rosehip tea (*Roter Tee* or *Hagebuttentee*) is common throughout Germany and rosehip jam in the north. This is a different use for the fruit, and an interesting one. For my experiment, I gathered, washed and cleaned about 700g of rosehips and steamed them with white wine. Then I passed them through a foodmill with a small amount of the wine and added about 300g of honey to the mash. I cooked it on a very low heat for about an hour before seasoning it with cloves, pepper, and ginger. Then I drew off half of it to put in glass jars. The rest cooked for an hour more before I spread it out on on a board to dry. This was one way *latwergen* were prepared in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the resulting sheet of thick jelly was cut into decorative lozenges or rolled up in strips for storage. It could be eaten as it was of dissolved in liquid to make a sauce.\n\nThe recipe here is unusual in that we normally find quinces or pears as the basis. Rosehips are laborious to process, but they taste very pleasant. If I make again, I will use a good deal less cloves, but it is definitely something to remember and will make a nice practical addition to my presentation come Saturday.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/23/rosehip-electuary/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/23/rosehip-electuary/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1i8cljo/rosehip_electuary_late_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1737662773.0, "score": 35, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1i8cljo/rosehip_electuary_late_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Ye Olde Fruit Rollups", "Did you include the rice flour?", "That is so cool!

The Dorotheenkloster MS also has similar ones made from other ingredients:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t166xrph0ee1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=add261716be43451073bba47b438e010e8807064\n\n***65 A cheese of poppyseed***\n\n***Take poppyseed and make enough milk of it for one serving (zu einem essn). Take one lot of isinglass and boil it so it dissolves in the water. Pass it through with that. When you have passed it through, the milk should be as thick as almond milk. Pour the milk to the isinglass and stir it together. Then add sugar and do not oversalt it. It should be sweet. Now pour it into a bowl that is not too wide, like a cheese strainer (kese naph). Once it has gone cold, it turns hard. Put the cheese out onto a different bowl and stick the cheese all about with nuts. If you wish, cut it into four pieces. Make a sweet almond milk or nut milk to go with it and serve it.***\n\n***66 Another cheese of hemp***\n\n***Take hemp that is raw, pound it, and pass it through 2 or 3 (times) with boiled water. Take one lot of isinglass with it and \u00bd (pound) of almonds for a sweet milk. That was, you make a hemp cheese. Stick it all over with whatever you please and do not oversalt it.***\n\n***67 A cheese of nuts***\n\n***Take nuts, shell them nicely and pound them very small. Boil one lad of isinglass, take the boiled water, and pass it through with that (the nuts). Sweeten the milk with sugar, but do not let it boil. Put it into a cheese bowl (kese naph) and let it cool. Make a thin sweet milk to go with it. Slice it or leave it whole, and do not oversalt it. This is how you make all manner of cheeses.***\n\nThere are further recipes for soups and other dishes made from hemp, poppyseed, and nuts that all depend on this remarkable creative facility for making milk out of plants. They are not always entirely clear, such as these two:\n\n***53 A poppyseed cheese***\n\n***Take the poppyseed and pound it small. And you must wash it clean and boil it. Take off the curds (schotten) from the top and put it into a reindel (cooking vessel) with oil. Take two apples, cut them lengthwise, and fry them in oil. Put them on (the cheese). This way you are to prepare it with milk and with sugar.***\n\n***54 A hemp curd cheese (schotten)***\n\n***Take raw hemp and pound it small, wash it, and drain it on a cloth twice, that way it is clean. Then boil it and take off the curd (schotten) of it. You must have ready a reindlein (small vessel) with oil in it. Put the curds in that. Then take 4 apples or 5, cut them lengthwise and small, and fry them in the oil. Put that on top of the curds in the pot, and (put) sugar on it (as well).***\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure how the cheese is formed here, but again, the point that interests me is the first step. Clearly, plant-based milk was a much more important part of broader European culture before the Reformation. Also, and this is what makes these recipes especially interesting \u2013 unlike imported almonds, hemp and poppyseed as well as native nuts would have been available to people of much smaller means. We should bear in mind that when our recipes speak so readily of almond milk, just as when they mention capons, pike, or venison, a more affordable alternative would have been readily available.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

Take one pound (libra) of almonds and pound them small, and pass the almonds through and let them boil. Add starch (ummerduz), that way it turns thick, and add sugar, that way it turns sweet. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis isn\u2019t very exciting as a dish. Basically, it\u2019s a Mus, a spoonable dish, and what we would call an elderflower-flavoured blancmange. *Ummerduz* is an odd word, but just a variant spelling of [*umerdum* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/30/almond-starch-pudding/)which is, of course, *amydon* \u2013 starch. What makes it interesting is that there are[ a lot of recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/27/elderflower-mus-again/)that[ use elderflower](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/21/elderflower-porridge-from-cgm-384-ii/) as a [seasonal flavouring](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/20/elderflower-pasta-from-the-innsbruck-ms/). This seems to have been an extremely popular thing to do in Germany. The time window for elderflowers is narrow, though, and I haven\u2019t found any for preserving the flavour as we do today in [beverage syrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderflower_cordial). Since all surviving recipes depend on steeping or boiling the flowers in milk, they would be off limits on fast days. Except that here, the flowers are boiled in water which is then used to make almond milk, the upper-class standby for Lent. This could easily be used to make all the other recipes, from plain porridge as in the [Munich Cgm 384 collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf):\n\n***48 Elderflower muo\u00df***\n\n***Take elderflowers and boil them in milk and pass that through a cloth, and make a muo\u00df with this as you please, and with grated white bread or other things, that will taste very good (gar wol geschmack) and also be healthy. You may also colour it and spice it if you please, but it has a good flavour by itself.***\n\nAnd all the way to the elaborate elderflower-flavoured pasta in the [Innsbruck MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Innsbrucker-Rezeptbuch.pdf):\n\n***128 If you would make a chopped elderflower porridge, boil the elderflowers in good milk and pass it through so that the milk takes on the scent. Take two eggs or 3 and good flour, beat the eggs into it and chop it very well and prepare the porridge from that etc.***\n\nAnother reminder, if we needed one, to keep in mind that cooks in the middle ages were just as inventive and creative as ever.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

The Dorotheenkloster MS has almost the exact same recipe in the company of three others that make it a little clearer what is going on. I was on the wrong path.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jotnstfl7u9e1.jpg?width=331&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cf8ceab7fc0393623612f22630de66135158053\n\n***41 Of a quick porridge (geyslitz)***\n\n***For a white geislitz, take a pound (libra) of almonds. Blanch them nicely, grind them small, and pass them through (a cloth) with the geislitz, as much (of it) as is needed to make a good dish. Set this over (the fire) in a cauldron or cooking pot and let it boil together. As it begins to thicken, add water. Add salt and sugar to it, but do so in measure. When it has boiled, put it into a bowl and let it stand.***\n\n***42 A black porridge (geyslitz)***\n\n***Take 1 pound (libra) of raisins and grind them thoroughly so they become small. (And) you should take small ships (schifflein) made of gingerbread. If you cannot get those, use another kind of gingerbread (letzelten), slice it thin, and toast it until it is black. Let it cool, pound it small, and sieve it through a pepper sieve (pfeffer sib). You should do this with as much of it as is enough. And you must have one pound (talentum) of honey and add it to that, and also add good spices. You must mix this with the geislitz and pass through the raisins, and let it boil well. Add white ginger and stir it well, and also add sugar. If it becomes too thick, add Romania wine (rumanie) and serve it cold.***\n\n***43 Of a red porridge (geislitz)***\n\n***Take \u00bd pound (talentum) of raisins. You must pass them through with the geislitz and \u00bd pound (talentum) of honey. Let this boil together. Add spices: pepper and saffron. When it has boiled, pour it on (a bowl?) and let it cool. Do not oversalt it.***\n\n***44 A coarse (or grey?) porridge (geyslitz)***\n\n***Take geyslitz and pass it through a cloth. Let it boil well so it becomes nicely thin. Pour it in a bowl and let it cool. Take off the skin, and prepare it with wine or with cold milk, as you please. And serve it forth.***\n\nIn this sequence of recipes, we can see that what they describe is not the *geislitz* itself, but methods of colouring it. The dish itself is simply taken as familiar, and it makes sense as the kind of porridge[ usually known by that name](https://mhdwb-online.de/wb.php?buchstabe=G&portion=3420&link_lid=61863000#61863000). It is typically viewed as a humble food, so these are ways of ennobling it with expensive, high-status ingredients like almonds, honey, raisins, and spices.\n\nAgain, we meet the \u2018little ships\u2019 of gingerbread that we [discussed ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/04/fake-roast-of-pike/)[previously](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/29/geislitz-a-raisin-dish/). As I said before, I do not believe Aichholzer\u2019s emendation is correct. This is very likely a reference to shape and may refer to a specific kind of gingerbread. Unfortunately I have yet to find any other reference to this. We are lucky the recipe itself suggests a substitution because we have [surviving recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/gingerbread-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-2/) for [other kinds of gingerbread](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/06/twice-baked-gingerbread/).\n\nAs to the basic dish, it is poured into bowls to solidify after cooking and can be served cold. Another recipe for a [jelly called a *geislitz*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/04/calves-foot-jelly-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) from [Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf) suggests that the original had a fairly stiff, sliceable consistency. This can be achieved with millet or barley porridge which turns into a kind of polenta and can be sliced and fried, but there is no reason why it couldn\u2019t be done with other grains as well.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

It is a  bit of a war story, so if you would rather not read all of that, you can  cut straight to the recipes [here](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Late-Antique-Feast-at-Golden-Arrow.pdf). \n\nAs some of you may know, I am active in a medieval society, the [Society for Creative Anachronism, in Germany](https://drachenwald.sca.org/#/).  Most of what I do there is cook approximately historic food for events,  traditionally in the form of evening feasts on Saturday. A few months  ago, the queen of Drachenwald \u2013 that translates into normal English  broadly as the chairperson of our European branch \u2013 announced she would  be in Southern Germany the third weekend of December and would anyone  care to meet. I replied that if there was a social get-together, I would  be happy to come down and cook for it. Things snowballed from there,  and we ended up renting a local shooting club\u2019s premises for an event  for forty people with archery, armoured fighting, arts classes, and a  feast. That part was my job. \n\nThe queen eats neither meat nor fish, so I started looking into options  that would give her a satisfactory meal. Most medieval Lenten food  relies on fish, so that was not an option. However, one reasonably well  documented culinary tradition that does not treat meatless food as a  penance is the Roman one. I had [done Roman food before](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/28/a-roman-supper-before-trier/) and also had good experiences with [Late ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/26/a-dark-age-meal/)[Antique ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/23/gregorian-frittata/)recipes. Some of the research translated into a [cooking session this autumn](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/15/experimental-recipe-session-hits-and-misses/) which is also documented on my blog. By then, the menu had taken on a viable shape. \n\n As the number of participants grew and more and more armoured fighters  registered attendance, I expanded the feast to include more meat. Thanks  to a donation of venison, I was able to include two more dishes, which  meant pork, beef, and deer for anyone who wanted it. at the same time,  replacing the Roman fish sauce garum with vegan soy sauce made the rest  of the feast suitable for vegetarians. I was happy with that solution. \n\n By that time, preparations for the event were well under way. I had  recruited a second in command (always important in case the primary cook  falls ill) and serving and cleanup coordinators and was writing  ingredient lists and menu cards when the cold season of 2022 struck.  While I was recovered enough to be able to cook on the 17th, my writing  had fallen far behind. In the end, I only finished the ingredient list  on the train Friday evening and e-mailed it to the event coordinator who  printed out ten copies for posting in the hall and distributing on  tables. We do this to ensure everyone can check for allergens and  intolerances.  \n\n Cooking began inauspiciously. Over the course of the week, I learned  that my kirtchen staff had all fallen ill and I would be working with  temporary volunteers. Once in the kitchen, the stove refused to light.  We were able to get it working (a valve had frozen), but it took a  nerve-racking hour and we found that the main oven had no bottom heat. A  quick rearrangement of plans worked around this problem, but then  shortly before lunch someone observed that the crockpots the stews were  in had been plugged into a dead outlet. With an hour to go, we  transferred their content to the main gas range and got everything  ready.  \n\n The rest of the day went smoothly. I had a series of volunteers cycle  through the kitchen who proved skilled and dedicated, and there were no  more equipment failures. We did find that the ingredient list printouts  had disappeared, but one volunteer transcribed the list by hand three  times from the screen of my laptop before the battery ran out, a truly  medieval experience. In the end, we served the feast in time as an  enthusiastic team of volunteers coordinated by a head server with just  one of the handwritten lists for instruction worked miracles.  \n\nI am very proud of everybody who pitched in to make this happen. The  result was delicious: We started out with honey mustard, horseradish  sauce, epityrum olive relish and must bread on the tables. The main  course consisted of honey-roast pork, beef stew, venison stew, an  asparagus frittata and one of dates and olives, lentils with chestnut  puree, beetroots in a mustard-vinegar sauce, and carrots in cumin sauce  with barley polenta. For dessert, we had dairy fritters, honey-glazed  dates, white cheese with honey, quince bread, nuts, and fruit.\n\nThe menu card and ingredient list that should have been available to  the feasters as well as the cooking instructions that I forwarded to my  kitchen staff are [now available online](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Late-Antique-Feast-at-Golden-Arrow.pdf).  I wish I had been able to have all of it available on the weekend \u2013 it  would have made things so much easier \u2013 but at least it is here now. I  hope some of you will enjoy cooking some of the recipes yourself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/zue0sa/a_late_antique_feast/", "created_utc": 1671901794.0, "score": 24, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/zue0sa/a_late_antique_feast/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This is so cool!!"]}

{"title": "Sweet Hedgehogs (15th c.)", "selftext": "Since I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to post much over the next few days, I\u2019ll be putting up three recipes today. The Dorotheenkloster MS parallels recipes for decorative hedgehog subtelties [found in the later Meister Hans collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/30/a-collection-of-hedgehogs/) very closely:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9f5v8qkdvtae1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0422b2a2baf4a0c0dbe178d3d7b1ecbcd5aa4295\n\n***38 A white hedgehog***\n\n***Take a pound of almonds, pound them very small, add sugar, mash it together and shape a hedgehog from it. Take 12 almond kernels and cut them lengthwise. Stick the hedgehog with them in the middle and all over (misplaced here: 1 talentum) like spines. Do not oversalt it and serve it.***\n\n***39 A black hedgehog***\n\n***Take a pound (libra) of raisins, wash them nicely and pick them cleanly so nothing unclean remains. Fry (swaissen) them nicely in a pan and let them cool. When they are dry, pound them small and add cinnamon, cloves, and sugar. Mash it together and shape a hedgehog. When it is ready, stick it all over with cloves, those will be its spines. You must give the hedgehog a gilded nutmeg in its mouth. Do not oversalt it, and serve it.***\n\n***40 A red hedgehog***\n\n***Take a pound (libra) of figs and wash off the flour. Let them dry again. Then chop them small, pound them with good spices, and add saffron. That makes it red. You must not forget the sugar. When it is pounded small, you must mash it together and shape a hedgehog. Stick it with silvered cloves. Those will be its spines. Give it a fig in its mouth.***\n\nThese are not quite exactly the same recipes. Meister Hans omits silvering the cloves on the red hedgehog and makes a quip about healthy food for hedgehogs on the black one, and most centrally, has ginger instead of the more plausible raisins as its main ingredient. However, they are clearly very closely related. The fact that a manuscript most likely dating to around 1414 so closely parallels one dated internally to 1460 and purporting to be the work of a named individual is a salutary reminder not to trust what our sources say about themselves too much. Meister Hans may be the work of an individual, but date to a much earlier time than its surviving copy. It may be ascribed to an individual at that tiome, but in fact be a compliation of earlier material. Or the dating of either manuscript may be wrong. Certainly, things are not as straightforward as they appear when looking at just one source.\n\nAs recipes, these three are very attractive. A hedgehog is and easy shape to master, and they make lovely centrepieces on a dining table arranged into a small family. The white one, mild and sweet, and the more intensely flavoured black and red with their spicy spines will offer something for everyone, eaten as the meal comes to a close. Especially [white almond hedgehogs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/01/an-almond-hedgehog-from-the-inntalkochbuch/), [not an uncommon recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/05/almond-cheeses-from-the-innsbruck-ms/) [in various iterations](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/21/rice-recipes-from-the-kuenstlichs-und-fuertrefflichs-kochbuch/), are also a fun activity for children taking their first steps in historic cooking and can be made with storebought marzipan if you are in a hurry. But with enough effort and talent, they can be turned into stunning pieces of art.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/03/more-hedgehogs/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/03/more-hedgehogs/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hsub1u/sweet_hedgehogs_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1735931429.0, "score": 21, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hsub1u/sweet_hedgehogs_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I'm not adding sugar to something already as sweet as figs, that's a total sugar bomb and would be more so for late medieval Germans, for whom it was more expensive and therefore rare"]}
{"title": "On Red Cabbage (16th-20th c.)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/01/of-rotkohl/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/01/of-rotkohl/)\n\nThe taste of winter in Germany is deep, rich purple. Few of the heavy, meaty dishes that mark festivities in the darkest time of the year come without Rotkohl. Stewed slowly and usually preserved in glass jars, it can now be had cheaply in supermarkets or, at a higher price, made to perfection in restaurant kitchens. Soft, but not quite mushy, richly spices, with a sweet note of apple counterbalancing the bite of vinegar, there is little to recall its vegetable origin. It is almost fruity, and many children who will balk at the mere suggestion of eating greens can be persuaded to have a portion of this seasonal pleasure. It almost feels as though it has been with us from the dawn of time, so deeply is it rooted in German holiday custom, but in fact, it is a relatively recent addition to our cuisine.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6opckdur4eae1.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06a8516c7f1b8e645b9f0c30ad213c1c5dfcd899\n\nRed cabbage can be documented in German recipes since the sixteenth century, though it was probably known and used earlier in Italy. The earliest evidence we have suggests it was valued for its colour and served in salads. Thus, Marx Rumpolt writes:\n\n***Take a red cabbage head, cut it very small and cook it shortly in hot water. Then cool it quickly and season it with vinegar and oil. After it has lain in vinegar for a while, it turns beautifully red. (New Kochbuch clvii v)***\n\nThis, incidentally, is a feature of the plant that has fascinated people for a long time: It is a natural pH indicator. A high acidity level will make it turn red, closer to neutral it will be purple, and an alkaline environment makes it very nearly blue. The more vinegar is traditionally added to the dish, the redder it is, the less of it, the closer to blue. However, the distinction between *Rotkohl/Rotkraut* in the north of Germany versus *Blaukraut* in the south did not come about because of culinary preferences. German simply lacked a widespread word to describe the blend of blue and red at the time the words were formed.\n\nAs late as 1723, it is still completely plausible for the Brandenburgisches Koch-Buch (a pirated edition of [Maria Sophia Schellhammer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sophia_Schellhammer)\u2018s [Die wohl-unterwiesene K\u00f6chin](https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/17730/1) of 1697) to state that red cabbage \u201c\u2026only serves in salad.\u201d (II.11, p. 453). It was probably served cooked, so the step to making it a warm dish would not have been great, but that did not make it the Rotkohl we know today. Despite the association with the north of Germany, the Hamburgisches Koch-Buch of 1830 gives these bare instructions:\n\n***Red Cabbage***\n\n***The same is cut very thin, like Sauerkohl, and cooked in a stoneware pan with a glassful of red wine, vinegar, butter, and salt. It is covered and steamed slowly, then served. (VII.11, p. 216)***\n\nJohann Friedrich Baumann\u2019s Der Dresdner Koch of 1844 describes a similar process, but suggests the sweet note we expect today as an option:\n\n***Steamed red cabbage***\n\n***The red cabbage is cut in fine strings, like white cabbage is for steaming, and steamed like the latter with a large glassful of red wine or a little vinegar and meat broth. Finally, it is stirred with a few spoonfuls of brown sauce and seasoned as desired with pepper or a very small amount of sugar. (vol. 1 p. 378)***\n\nOur first encounter with the flavours of the modern version comes in the [Anweisung in der feineren Kochkunst](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tk07AAAAcAAJ&pg=GBS.PA570&hl=de) by [Johann Rottenh\u00f6fer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Rottenh%C3%B6fer), personal cook to King Maximilian of Bavaria, in 1859:\n\n***Steamed red cabbage (Blaukraut)***\n\n***Several heads of red cabbage have the coarse outer leaves removed and are halved and sliced thinly with a knife or cabbage slicer (geschnitten oder gehobelt). Then, a piece of white bacon is cut very fine, placed in a casserole, and saut\u00e9ed to a yellow colour with two tablespoons full of finely cut onions. The cabbage is quickly washed and put in, then a glass of vinegar, the necessary salt, a piece of sugar, and a glass full of Burgundy are added together with two peeled apples cut in thin slices. Thus it is slowly steamed on a coal fire until it is soft, stirring frequently. Shortly before serving, it is lighly dusted (with flour) and cooked for a few minutes more. It is served piled high, with roasted pork cutlets or pieces of roast hare, bacon, roast bratwurst, mutton or veal cutlets and the like arranged around it. (#1313, p. 570)***\n\nThis is clearly a courtly dish for an opulent table with many guests, but it comes quite close to what we know as Apfelrotkohl. The 1866 edition adds a further recipe for red cabbage \u00e0 la Valencienne that adds pepper and nutmeg, two spices still popular. Meanwhile, the 1879 Illustrirtes Hamburger Kochbuch by Louise Richter moves in a similar direction:\n\n***No. 708 Red cabbage***\n\n***You cook red cabbage as you do white Sauerkohl, except the caraway is omitted and white wine is used in place of red. (this is an error: red wine instead of white)***\n\n***No 713 To cook pickled Sauerkohl***\n\n***For 5 persons, take 2 pounds of Sauerkohl from the vat, press it out, and lay it in boiling water in which about 1 pound of pork belly has been boiling for an hour. Then you add a few large Mus\u00e4pfel (mushy cooking apples), 2 glasses full of white wine, a tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon of ground caraway and let it cook slowly for about two hours until the cabbage is very soft. Now, you scatter a heaped spoonful of flour over it, stir it through, let it boil for a little longer, and serve it with bread dumplings (Semmelkl\u00f6\u00dfchen) or small potatoes cooked in salt water.***\n\nThis does not really support the idea of an often-claimed origin in the Hamburg region. Rather, it seems to be a general fashion that we find very similarly in Isabella Beeton\u2019s Book of Household Management (1859 edition #1099). Interestingly, while Mrs. Beeton suggests sugar and apples, Eliza Acton\u2019s 1845 Modern Cookery for Private Families from which many of Beeton\u2019s recipes are lifted does not. Here (p. 340), red cabbage is stewed with butter, pepper, and salt and has only vinegar added at the very end. This is much closer to the earlier recipes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wlu4gyy4eae1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f218abc3c17d3914a83c6e7d1dd7e50351bd5d6\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, red cabbage as we know it has arrived fully. Katharina Prato\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche K\u00fcche suggests just a hint of apple:\n\n***Red cabbage. You cut the cabbage noodle-style, sprinkle it with a little vinegar, and leave it to stand for half an hour. 1 1/2 hours before serving, you put it into hot butter or lard with onions fried yellow, salt it, and layer slices of tart apples on top. Let it steam while regularly adding a small amount of broth. When the apples have softened, they are removed and stir the cabbage all the way through before serving it. If it is too little sour, add a little vinegar, if it is too sour, add a little sugar. (p. 156, 50th edition, Vienna 1912)***\n\nHer northern counterpart Henriette Davidis (32nd edition, 1901) is wordier:\n\n***Red cabbage or kappes. Red summer cabbage is preferable to winter cabbage because the latter has a stronger taste and requires twice as much time to cook. In preparing, cut the head in half, remove the coarse outer leaves and strong ribs, and slice or cut it into thin, long strips. To remedy its bloating effect, parboil it and mix it after draining with as much vinegar as will give it a shiny red colour. Then bring water to the boil with pork lard, goose or duck fat, or half suet and half butter. Add a few raisins, two sour apples cut in pieces, several small onions, a little sugar, and some salt and stew the cabbage soft in this. Best use Bunzlauer-style cooking pots (A type of glazed pottery still produced in Boleslawiec, Poland). Shortly before serving, dust a little flour over it and add a glass of red wine and, where this is liked, a few spoonfuls of redcurrant jelly. Steam quartered apples lying on top of the cabbage to serve it adorned with them. Cabbage cooked this way requires no further addition of vinegar because its fine flavour is tart enough and far more digestible than if it had received its tartness from vinegar. It is best to serve it with small fried potatoes, but where time is lacking, boiled salted potatoes can be served.***\n\n*Kappes*, incidentally, is a dialect term for cabbage found in the northern Rhine valley near the dutch border, and adding currant jelly to red cabbage is today thought of as a Dutch habit.\n\nThe twentieth century added little to this, but it simplified the recipe into the dish familiar not as a laboriously made one-off serving, but as suitable for preservation in glass jars to be opened at need. The famous \u2018blue Book\u2019 Das elektrische Kochen (4th edition, 1938) produced by the Berlin utilities company BEWAG suggests in its inimitably economical style:\n\n***Red cabbage***\n\n***1 1/2 \u2013 2 tablespoons of lard, 1 kg cleaned red cabbage, 1 onion stuck with cloves, salt, 3-5 tablespoons of water, 4 apples, sugar, 1 pinch of cinnamon, if liked, 1 pinch of cloves, vinegar***\n\n***Spread the fat around the pot, layer in the finely sliced or cut cabbage, the onion stuck with cloves, salt, water, and the sliced apples, bring to a boil at setting 3 and steam for 35-45 minutes on setting 1, ten minutes without further electricity. Then add cinnamon, cloves, and vinegar to taste.***\n\nFinally, the much underrated, quietly ingenious Grete Willinsky leaves us intructions for the version without apples as well as with \u2013 now named for Hamburg \u2013 in the 1958 Kochbuch der B\u00fcchergilde:\n\n***Red cabbage (which called Blaukraut south of the Main river!)***\n\n***2-3 pounds of red cabbage, 1 large onion, 3-4 cloves, 2 bay leaves, 100 g lard or goose fat, 1/2 cup of vinegar, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, broth, water, or red wine***\n\n***Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage, quarter it, remove the stalks and slice it very fine. Melt the fat in an enamelled pot, add the cabbage, and saut\u00e9 it while stirring permanently. Then add the vinegar and stir it in thoroughly. Only then may you add meat broth or, better, a mix of meat broth and red wine in equal quantities (altogether about 1/4 of a litre). This is the only way the cabbage keeps its lovely red-violet colour. Now also add one large onion stuck with 3-4 cloves, 2 bay leaves, salt, pepper, and sugar, cover it, and let it stew on a low heat for 1-1 1/2 hours until it is done. Serve it with chestnuts or dumplings and venison or gamebirds, pork cutlets, pork roast, in some parts also goose and duck.***\n\n***Red cabbage the Hamburg way***\n\n***It is prepared exactly as described above, except that you add 2-3 peeled, cored, and julienned apples to the cabbage. In Pomerania, a pinch of caraway is popular, in Holland \u2013 a tablespoon of redcurrant jelly stirred in. (p. 200)***\n\nWillinsky follows up these recipes with one for red cabbage salad:\n\n***1 small red cabbage, salt water, 1 cup wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 3 tablespoons oil, salt, pepper, 1 pinch of sugar, apples if desired***\n\n***Finely slice the cabbage, soak it in a cup of wine vinegar, and boil it in salt water for five minutes. Drain it and mix it with 1 tablespoon of vinegar, 3 tablespoons of oil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar while it is still warm. Add one peeled, cored, and julienned apple if you wish. The salad, once prepared, must rest for several hours to soften. Red cabbage salad is beautiful on a winter salad platter next to white cabbage, celeriac, and carrot salad.***\n\nRumpolt would be proud.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hr3qat/on_red_cabbage_16th20th_c/", "created_utc": 1735740977.0, "score": 21, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hr3qat/on_red_cabbage_16th20th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["These sound amazing \ud83d\udc4f Thanks for including the ones without apples.", "this is wonderful, thank ya!", "> However, the distinction between Rotkohl/Rotkraut in the north of Germany versus Blaukraut in the south did not come about because of culinary preferences.

They had been in such a hurry that  they had fallen into the dirt. They needed water, and it was brought to  them immediately. Farindkuo pushed in front of Else (I think he felt the  wait was too long) and ordered that he should be given water  immediately. The servant poured it carefully from above on his sleeves,  not into the middle of the basin, holding up his head and thrusting out  his legs stiffly. The basin was a wide sieve that had been bought for  the wedding.***\n\n***The maiden Else was unhappy and she also went where the  water was poured.

Oh, when she saw this she regretted  it. She had no breeches and did not want to ruin her shift by drying her  hands, and to rub them in the air took too long and seemed pointless to  her. Thus she came to the table wet and sat on her arse rightaway (*****auf dem ars gesass*****). Her feet were not idle: they pushed over pitchers and shifted the tablecloth.***\n\n***\u201cSo, you sow, so, you sow, so!\u201d (*****so sau so sau so du so*****) said*** **her Ochsenchropf (Sir Ox-Gullet)** ***then,  \u201cI do not like your fun, it harms us in the stomach.\u201d If the had drunk  more, this would have ended in blows, but the matter was settled and the  tablecloth spread out again.***\n\nThis description is designed to evoke the mockery of and trigger  disgust in the upper classes of fifteenth-century Germany. Going to the  table with unwashed hands was unthinkable, and doing it properly was a  social ritual. You held out your hands over a basin held by a servant  while another poured a thin stream of water over your hands from above,  and you quickly  and neatly rubbed it over your fighers. This was no  thorough wash. If your hands were actually dirty, you had to get them  clean before. After this quick ablution, you dried your fingers on a  proffered towel and were ready to enjoy your meal. \n\nObviously, the servants were expected to be clean and skilful. These,  with their long, pointy fingernails and awkward stance, are already on  record eating spilled soup from the bare earth and surely would have  disgusted any listener at the time as much as they do us. Wiping  your  hands on your breeches (*pruoch* \u2013 *Bruche*) is a similar breach of taboo. The *Bruche* was an undergarment that was not meant to ever be visible in polite company. \n\nOf course, every aspect of the company is a disgusting caricature.  The titles are wildly inappropriate and the bynames deeply dehumanising.  *Ochsenchropf* means the gullet or dewflap of an ox, but the word *Kropf* used  in human contexts refers to a struma, a common ailment in mountainous  regions until the twentieth century. A very exaggerated version of it  can be seen on the woman depicted on page one of the manuscript above. *Farindkuo* may  charitably be thought of as a farmworker engaged in veterinary  obstetrics, but it should be noted that later fifteenth century sources  record *ch\u00fcefigger* as an insult aimed at the Swiss. \n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem \u201aDer Ring\u2018 (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself to  translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners, but  would advise anyone with enough command of German to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11rn5h5/how_not_to_wash_your_hands_in_the_fifteenth/", "created_utc": 1678858160.0, "score": 21, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11rn5h5/how_not_to_wash_your_hands_in_the_fifteenth/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Thus they become thick. Make the mass quite thick, as for meatballs (*****flaysch knoedlein*****).  When the meat broth is boiling, lay them in and let them cook quite  gently. They must not cook long. And put in fat and eggs beforehand,  otherwise it does no good.***\n\nThis recipe makes an interesting addition to previous ones for [meat ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/10/dumplings-with-boiled-veal-from-the-oeconomia/)and [bread](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/13/dumpling-recipes-from-the-oeconomia-part-three/) [dumplings](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/11/more-dumplings-except-these-arent/). It is not entirely clear, but  it seems that finely chopped onions are seasoned with  pepper and fried in oil (*brennen* always  refers to a high heat and is used in roux recipes and for drizzling hot  fat over foods to give them a crust). They are then mixed with eggs and  the result worked into a  dough with flour, semolina (*grie\u00df* refers  to coarsely ground grain suitable for porridge), and grated bread. The  mass is worked into dumplings and cooked in hot water, probably simmered  at a low heat. \n\nThe final sentence is a little cryptic. I guess it means that you  must properly first fry the onions and then work the dough, not add the  onions to the dough as one might. The recipe allows for the  interpretation of cooking the eggs with the onions, but I am not  sure  how well  scrambled egg dumplings would hold together. The flavour  profile could well be interesting though.  \n\nAs to the attribution of the dish, it is possible that this kind of  dumpling was eaten in peasant  households. Eggs, onions, fat, flour and  even grated bread would be available in a rural kitchen. Like many  dishes called \u2018peasant\u2019 in surviving recipes, they are not poverty food  by any description, though. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.  Despite its brevity, it is interesting especially as it contains many  recipes for *k\u00fcchlein*, baked or deep-fried confections, that  apparently played a significant role in displaying status.

{"title": "Lung Sausage (15th c.)", "selftext": "Today\u2019s recipe from the Dorotheenkloster is one that occurs in several other sources. I will largely be repeating what I wrote about it when discussing [its other](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/03/a-lung-sausage-from-cgm-384-ii/) [iterations](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/21/experiments-in-sausage-making-i-lung-sausage-after-rheinfrankisches-kochbuch/):\n\n[This recipe, but in regular sausage casings. It was okay.](https://preview.redd.it/h58wy3hz2a6e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4426084912dfab41a15a5ba07eb0f770d2d01fc4)\n\n***11 A roast dish of a bung (afterdarm)***\n\n***Take the bung (i.e. the rectum, affterdorm) of a calf and clean it. Chop the lungs together with bacon, spice and colour it, and fill it into the bung. Cut sausages (into it?) if you like. Then roast it and serve it dry (i.e. without sauce)***\n\nThis recipe recurs many times, including in the [Munich manuscript Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf), [Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-Meister-Hans.pdf) and the [Rheinfr\u00e4nkisches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rheinfrankisches-Kochbuch.pdf), and I already [experimented with recreating a version](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/21/experiments-in-sausage-making-i-lung-sausage-after-rheinfrankisches-kochbuch/) of it. The wording is very similar, though in this instance we are instructed to colour the filling \u2013 most likely with saffron \u2013 and get the rather enigmatic advice that we can cut sausages if we like \u2013 that may well be garbled or an inclusion from a different recipe.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, this dish makes eminent sense. When slaughtering a calf, neither the lungs nor the rectum are good candidates for preservation. This way, they can be turned into a dish that is solid and roastable and can be sliced at the table, which qualifies it as a main course, a status often indicated by the term *braten*. Once prepared \u2013 most likely boiled in the same cauldron that was used to cook other sausages and organ meats \u2013 a lung sausage like this would last for a few days or even weeks if properly smoked, but it was not something you could lay in as supplies. Depending on the occasion, it could be served as part of the *Schlachtfest*, given to servants while the quality enjoyed fresh muscle meat, or kept to enjoy next week when the last of the very fresh veal was gone.\n\nBy way of information: the rectum is the fat-lined part of the gut that directly precedes the anus. It is known to butchers as *Fettdarm* or *Afterdarm* and used in a number of traditional preparations. *Klobwurst* and some varieties of liver sausage are still cooked and smoked in the rectum. It is no more or less unhygienic or icky than any other part of the intestine and perfectly edible, though not a pleasure to chew. However, it is not easy to source. Few traditional butchers part with it, and most meat processors do not save it separately. I recommend substituting large intestine if you cannot get it.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n   \n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/11/lung-sausage-again/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/11/lung-sausage-again/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hc30on/lung_sausage_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1733948485.0, "score": 21, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hc30on/lung_sausage_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Take a small bag, the size that a roast is supposed to be, pour in the eggs, and suspend the bag in hot water until it becomes thick (firms up). Then turn it out, stick it on a small spit so it does not break up, and lard it with boiled egg whites (so it looks) like any other roast. Pour hot fat on it.***\n\n***231 To make venison out of eggs***\n\n***Take 4 eggs and a little milk, and make a batter as thick as a batter for small fritters (kyechlin dayg). Spice it well and make it yellow. Then pour it into a bag and lift it into boiling water. Let it boil until it hardens, then take it out and cut it into slices one finger long. Then lay them in hot fat and let them fry until they are done. Then prepare a black pepper sauce (to serve) over them, and chop the whites of eggs as lardons to go with it.***\n\nAs with many other Lenten recipes, the point here is to replicate the appearance of forbidden foods, not their flavour. That said, these do not sound bad taken simply on their own merits. They might even be considered as vegetarian options for modern medieval feasts.\n\nThe first is a solid loaf of eggs, seasoned with herbs (and presumably salt) and drizzled with hot fat as it is spit-roasted. Strips of hard-boiled egg white are used to imitate larding. It would likely go well with many of the sauces typically served with roasts, but getting it to stay on the spit must have been quite a challenge.\n\nThe second recipe calls for a batter as through for fritters, presumably involving flour, spiced and coloured with saffron. It is treated as the eggs abvove, but then sliced and served in a \u2018black\u2019 pepper sauce as was commonly done with venison. This is not a new recipe; we have a [fairly exact parallel](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/28/fake-venison-in-pepper-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) in the fifteenth-century [Cod Pal Germ 551 collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf). Here, pieces of egg white are chopped for lardons, but otherwise the technique is identical.\n\nA black pepper sauce, by the way, is not made with black pepper, at least not exclusively. The word Pfeffer was a term for sauces in which spices provided the dominant flavour (as opposed to fruit-based, herb-based, garlic, or gingergbread sauces). A \u2018black\u2019 pepper sauce was named for its dark colour which was often achieved by binding it with blood, but in this case must have been provided by other means \u2013 possibly dark toasted bread. Venison was often served in [blood-based ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/01/venison-blood-and-kidney-stew-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)[sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/18/blood-sauce-for-venison-from-ggm-349/).\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1go7ojp/faux_meat_from_eggs_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1731264417.0, "score": 20, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1go7ojp/faux_meat_from_eggs_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This just sounds horrible."]}

The focus this time was one  \u201cpeasant food\u201d. It probably needs saying that this is not what most  peasants ate most days, but what the writers and readers of cookbooks  probably imagined they would eat. It is an interesting kind of cuisine,  though, heavier and heartier than the standard upper-class fare, with a  certain rib-sticking quality.  \n\n \n\n[Outer crust, freshly baked](https://preview.redd.it/bg6edkp0zosa1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c1315a1a195a90bf859665922c9bbed39d309e1)\n\nThe first recipe we tried was a *kraut* tart from [Johannes Coler\u2019s Oeconomia ruralis et domestica](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/10/layered-herb-cake-from-the-oeconomia/): \n\n***To make a good baked dish (*****Gebackens*****)***\n\n***(marginalia: To make*** **Gebackens*****)***\n\n***If you would make a good baked dish of cake, make a good  white dough of wheat flour and lukewarm salt water. Then take melted  butter and make the dough nicely smooth (*****gelinde*****) so that it becomes all pliable (*****zehe*****) and always stays warm. Break it into pieces like (the size of) breadrolls (*****Semmeln*****), according to how large you would have your cake. Draw out the dough with your hands nicely thin and lay it on a concave (*****keulichte*****)  wooden bowl on which bakers usually slide bread into the oven, and  strew flour under it so that it does not stick. Then take leafy  vegetables (*****kraut*****), white or green, cut it shaggy and blanch (*****br\u00fch*****) it in hot salt water. Press it out with your hands so that no water stays in it and strew the*** **kraut** ***on  the drawn-out dough. If you wish, you may also strew in finely cut  cheese, and drizzle it with melted butter and lay another sheet of dough  atop it. Strew the same matter on that sheet again and add as many  sheets as thick you would have it. Press it well together at the edges,  slide it into an oven and let it bake. When it has baked, serve it. You  may also make such cakes of apples, pears, raisins, and all manner of  fruit and herbs.***\n\nThis is a fascinating recipe that caught my eye the first time I read  Coler. He gets creative with garden vegetables on occasion, and  especially with *kraut*. That term could refer to all kinds of  leafy greens but usually means cabbage, so that is how I interpreted it  here. Two small heads of Wirsing (Savoy cabbage) from the Turkish grocer  served as its base.\n\n \n\n[Inside layer, very fluffy](https://preview.redd.it/i3m7anq3zosa1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2ed937ac3f1bd980cb1da6a6b36e2b144c85ade)\n\nThe dough is clearly an upper-class preparation, with white flour and butter. The reference to *kuchen* suggests it was leavened, as *kuchen* recipes always were, and the description as *zehe*, the quality of being both pliable and elastic, makes it sound like an enriched bread dough. That is what we started with. \n\nThe cake we made, with blanched shredded cabbage, grated mature  cheese, and fat (not butter  due to the dairy intolerance of one  attendant), had only two layers, but I am convinced the original  envisioned more.  We closed it carefully and baked it slowly for two  hours to make sure the dough inside would be fully done. It came out  soft and fluffy, basically a steamed bread, and I wonder whether that  was part of the original intent or a side effect of following our modern  instincts.  \n\n \n\n[Top crust removed](https://preview.redd.it/gx0nclx5zosa1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=972cf4df482f5a89c1c7b144cf72fed9f84896ff)\n\nThe crust was quite hard and tough, especially at the top, and though  we managed to cut it into sections  the way a modern cake is served, it  would probably have been better to first remove it. The inside, a  combination of rich, creamy melted cheese, soft, fluffy bread, and  savoury cabbage, was definitely a winner. I can imagine this working  very well with more refined greens like spinach and aromatic herbs, too,  but cabbage was fine. Doing it again, I would \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* add more butter to the dough\n* roll out the layers thinner\n* salt and season the cabbage more\n* use a less intense , younger cheese, maybe a Gouda\n\nI also wonder how this would perform with an unleavened pie crust,  but I do not think it would work very well at all with a modern cold  crust. Hot water crust might be worth trying out.

The only difference is that you'd not normally use salty water for strudel, but I'm sure that'd still work very well.\n\nFor strudel, you make a dough with lukewarm water and flour, make sure to work it until it's nice and pliable, coat it with butter (or oil) and leave to rest in a warm place; then you draw the dough out very thin just like it says in this recipe.

That way, they will stay fresh for long and do not turn stinking.***\n\nI cannot exclude the possibility that the crawfish are simply served with vinegar as a condiment, but it doesn\u2019t seem convincing to me. A pot (*ein rend*) is not a serving dish, and vinegar is sometimes referred to as available at the table for diners to add to their food, so adding it to cooked crawfish seems superfluous. A ready pot of crawfish in a richly spiced vinegar pickle, on the other hand, would be just the thing to demonstrate understated wealth.

{"title": "Drying Mushrooms (15th c.)", "selftext": "There are some interesting recipes hidden among the interminable list of *gmues* in the Dorotheenkloster MS. This is one of them:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1kgdyp8nkhe1.jpg?width=354&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c1914c59221e61140958c0dc3253d4dcbb84290\n\n***122 A gm\u00fces of mushrooms (swammen)***\n\n***If you want to make gm\u00fces of mushrooms, pick them in May. Chop raysling (probably Lactarius deliciosus) and r\u00f6tling (today, R\u00f6tling refers to various Entoloma species, which are toxic. It may mean the St George\u2019s mushroom, Calocybe gambosa, here). Let them dry, then you can keep them long. They are (good) in Lent, I must say that. They are also good before Carnival. You can keep them as long as you wish.***\n\nThis is interesting for several reasons. First, it is rare for mushrooms to be named in medieval recipe sources. Here, we have two specific names: *raysling* and *r\u00f6tling*. Aichholzer renders the former as *Reizker*, Lactarius deliciosus. Despite the fact that this mushroom is usually seasonal in autumn, not May, that is a plausible interpretation. The term *r\u00f6tling* is harder to parse. Today, it usually refers to various toxic Entomola mushrooms, but that is unlikely to be meant here. It might be a reference to the similar-looking Calocybe gambosa which is edible and seasonal in spring.\n\nSecondly, here is evidence in writing that people understood edible mushrooms, that they gathered them, preserved them by drying, and cooked with them in the context of a wealthy kitchen. Most medical literature of the time considers mushrooms unhealthy, if not dangerous. Clearly, the Augustine canons at least did not mind. Dried mushrooms are kept through the year \u2013 from May to Lent, which usually falls in March and April. Of course it is intuitive and people throughout Central Europe still do this, but it is nice to have documentary confirmation.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Make a filling of veal, good fat from the kidneys, and all manner of good herbs. Break eggs into it and spice the filling with saffron, pepper, and mace. Fill the cabbage with that, and when it is filled, let it boil in water. Take it out and put it into good meat broth and let it boil in that. Add a little vinegar to it and serve it warm.***\n\nA filled cabbage head is found in a number of recipe sources from the sixteenth century, and I redacted a different one in my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook). The recipes differ enough to consider them separate, but the principle is the same: Adding a protein-rich filling to a head of cabbage. Here, as in most cases, it is meat, though there are instances where eggs are used. [Johannes Coler](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/05/a-meal-from-the-oeconomia/) calls that [a *Gartenhun* (garden chicken)](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/25/garden-chicken-from-the-oeconomia/).\n\nObviously, I have tried various iterations of this and I found them all good, hearty wintertime dishes. Which causes me to pause at the mention of veal and good herbs, both quite definitely not wintertime ingredients. I do not think I would relish this version in May or June, but tastes were more robust in a more physically active world. Certainly, the combination in itself \u2013 minced meat, kidney fat, eggs, herbs, pepper, mace, and a rich broth with a dash of vinegar \u2013 is attractive and calls for potatoes which, of course, also would not have been available in the 1550s. Dare to serve it with pasta or dark, crusty sourdough bread. It is worth it.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1giv38p/stuffed_cabbage_head_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1730662376.0, "score": 18, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1giv38p/stuffed_cabbage_head_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Looks like it could be really good!", "Wow- thanks!"]}
{"title": "A Quick Roman-ish Camp Meal", "selftext": "I was unable to post this Wednesday, trying again now:\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/07/31/quick-camp-cooking/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/07/31/quick-camp-cooking/)\n\nAfter a weekend away from home and two very intense days at work, I can finally return to posting things. Today, it will be a short account of what I cooked on Saturday.\n\nThe event I went to was run by my medieval club and took place outdoors, so we all camped. Since I had to come by train, I was quite grateful when someone offered to bring a modern tent and bedding for me. As their guest, I offered to cook lunch for the people in their camp. Since Saturday was when we were scheduled to have a feast in the evening, I kept it light and meat-free. Expecting rather high temperatures, I opted for a broadly Roman theme, and given I was, in the end, reduced to one camping stove, I had to reduce the number of cooked dishes, Still, it worked, and though the rain and unexpected absence of electricity delayed things, we had food about noon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yj4xlkdy0bgd1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00ac1f73fd5fc477d4cac3ed3fc5978a11680186\n\nNone of the dishes I served were exactly based on surviving recipes, but they are broadly based on known techniques and dishes. I would call it plausible supermarket-based historicising cuisine. All of it turned out quite edible, most of it was gone by the afternoon, and while it was not economical cooking, it fed six adults and two children for a little cover 20 euros in ingredients. This should be acceptable practice for any historical recreation, except that the rain flooded out all firepits, so I could not have made it with historic equipment even if I had intended to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0ywb1701bgd1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4100f6d43d48e75326381abe5b91e643cbb999f\n\nAt the centre of our meal, we had cheese flatbread and two patina-style dishes. The flatbread was based on the recipe for *libum* in [Cato the Elder\u2019s *de agri cultura*](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/E*.html), but it was interpreted quite loosely. I could get a very solid kind of curds called [*tvorog* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tvorog)at the supermarket and made a dough with flour and egg. It worked much better than the Quark I usually use. The plan was \u2013 since we could not have a fire \u2013 to use a sandwich toaster to cook it, but in the end outdoor electricity was also ourt of the question. I had to cook it over the gas stove. Since the dough was quite heavy, I first attempred to fry it with a little oil to prevent it from sticking to the pan, but that had the opposite effect. The best method, I found, was to flatten out the dough and lightly brush it with oil before throwing int into the hot pan. It cooked quickly and well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldm3ebs21bgd1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc9001232e54d8af8e2cd78c169704df721c2d88\n\nThe patina dishes were two, one with the thoroughly modern combination of button mushrooms and onions, the other with dates and olives in [a style described by Gregory of Tours](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/23/gregorian-frittata/). This is one of my favourite recipes, but in the absence of an oven, a lid, or a reliable way to reduce the heat enough, I cooked it faster, more like a modern omelet. A mix of eggs, milk, and flour, thoroughly beaten, was first poured into the pan, then the other ingredients were scattered on top and the entire thing cooked to a solid consistency. I also prepared two smaller ones without flour as a low-carb version for a diabetic guest, and they also turned out fine.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blcf55b51bgd1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b0cc62e1ec36309046004a092695ca4a3798fd8\n\nTo accompany this meal, we had cucumber (probably an anachronism, but a pleasure in the wet, sticky heat), radishes (definitely an anachronism, but at least similar to the ones the Romans had), a relish of olives and onions (not exactly [Cato\u2019s *epityrum*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/28/a-roman-supper-before-trier/), but inspired by it) and my favourite misinterpretation of a recipe, [Apicius\u2019 beet salad](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/24/a-late-antique-feast/) (no, he would have used the leaves, not the roots).\n\nAltogether \u2013 and that was the point here \u2013 making this kept me busy for about three hours, but that time was extended by having to move the kitchen to a dry location and figuring out what equipment was usable in the downpour. Under normal circumstances, I would expect maybe one hour less. This for a meal for six, made with ingredients purchased from a nearby Aldi and very basic equipment. It is very well possible to cook plausibly historic foods in a camp without being reduced to beast-on-a-spit, and it is certainly much nicer than grilled sausages and supermarket hot dog buns.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1eija98/a_quick_romanish_camp_meal/", "created_utc": 1722627902.0, "score": 19, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1eija98/a_quick_romanish_camp_meal/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you for reminding me I should post the Bay Area Culinary Historians recent Roman potluck.", "Looks and sounds delicious!

It was served together with fish. The servants behaved in a courtly  fashion, holding the bowls in front of their bellies, resting their  fingers some on them, some in them, some spilling half, and serving the  food to the guests as though strewing grass to a calf in the manger or  anywhere. The gentlemen thanked them for it. Lastersak (lit. sack of  vices) was very hungry. He looked around like a bull and called for a  spoon. The others shouted \u201cone for us, too!\u201d. Some found spoons, others  did not. They took their hands for ladles and ate as mannerly as the  others.***\n\n***Behold, such a brawl arose around the cabbage (*****chraut*****)  and the sauce that you have never seen such chasing and rushing in our  lifetime. You could see more than ten spoons stab like spears into each  bowl. They especially sought out the lardons, going after them with  their oars. Then Twerg (lit. Dwarf) at one point threw so much bacon  into his mouth that his beard was suddenly all dripping with fat (*****smaltzich*****).  Count Purkhardt did damage to all: He held a hand full of cabbage and  moved it towards his mouth, calling to God for the weather to remain  fine until the harvest was brought in. But how Chnotz took his revenge:  He stirred about the bowl until his spoon broke. So he went in with both  hands and grabbed cabbage on both sides, a big handful of food. \u201cBe it  fair weather or foul\u201d he said at that point, \u201cYou must go into my  gullet!\u201d***\n\n***Geri picked up the bowl and took a mighty gulp. She said \u201cGod grant you die of stench! (*****m\u00fcesst derstinken*****). You have eaten (*****frass*****)  it up, so I shall drink it!\u201d and sat down again so that a great part of  splashed out again. Oh, how she coughed! The others came to her  rightaway and drank it up \u2013 I don\u2019t know how \u2013 so that the tablecloth  stayed dry. But what else there was, leaves, grass, breadcrumbs, crusts  and bones, they left lying everywhere. Some also lingered in a courtly  manner, bent over their bowls so their path was short, for their loads  were heavy. And they had yet another reason for doing so: Should  anything fall off their spoons or out of their mouths, it would fall  right back into the bowl. Their mouths (*****m\u00e4uler*****) were wide open  the entire time. Then they also did this: Whenever their fingers became  wet, they waved them about over the cabbage quite deftly and wiped the  remainder off on their boots and their garments. They had to do this  because they had no napkins (hanttuoch) before them. They they  immediately reached out again. They were also pleased by another thing:  Whenever a diner dropped something to the ground, be it chewed or not,  it had to be picked up and placed before all of them again, except if it  had landed on his clothes. Then he was free to keep the morsels as he  pleased.***\n\nThere isn\u2019t really very much novel to say here. The manners on  display, the greed and vulgarity, are meant to amuse a more refined  readership, but they are very unlikely to be anything like a real  peasant banquet. An illustrative point, especially in contrast with the [fish course](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/21/wittenwilers-wedding-feast-v-a-heroic-death/), is how abundant the *chraut* is.  It\u2019s a lower-class dish, a catchall term that can refer to any leafy  greens, but usually means cabbage. This would likely have been available  in quantity, elevated to a festive status with copious amounts of meat.  [Grieben](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/01/fake-chopped-meat-and-cracklings-for-lent/),  fried lardons or cracklings, are mentioned specifically. These are  mentioned quite frequently as toppings for various vegetable dishes, a  quick and attractive way to enrich them on meat days. Clearly, the meat  is the desirable part, the things that people fight over, and though the  behaviour is unlikely to have been common, the sense of their value is  probably accurate. People craved meat and fat. \n\nAt the end of this section, diners are described wiping greasy hands  on their clothes and boots in the absence of napkins. This could be  simple calumny, another disgusting thing we imagine peasants doing, but  there may be more to it. Leather shoes needed regular greasing to stay  waterproof. A small bowl of fat would be provided in any household to do  so, and the German saying [\u201c*ins Fettn\u00e4pfchen treten*\u201c](https://www.geo.de/geolino/redewendungen/9195-rtkl-redewendung-ins-fettnaepfchen-treten) for a faux pas originates from the consequences of accidentally upending one. The fat used for this was *unschlitt*, considered unfit for human consumption, not food-grade *schmalz*.  However, in a society where fat was scarce and coveted, reserving some  of it for technical purposes must have been contentious and the boundary  between technical and culinary fats more blurry than our sources  generally like to admit. transgressing it may hint at a broader taboo. \n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem \u201aDer Ring\u2018 (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself to  translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners, but  would advise anyone with enough command of German to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11yuguf/peasants_gorging_on_kraut_c_1410/", "created_utc": 1679514708.0, "score": 19, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11yuguf/peasants_gorging_on_kraut_c_1410/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Have you ever seen a bunch of Cajuns at  a crawfish boil?

See that the rice is not overboiled.***\n\nNo doubt the similarity is intended. It is quite possible this way of cooking cereals \u2013 whole, hulled grains rather than porridge \u2013 carried status. It will certainly look more attractive than a flat bowl of oatmeal, textured, milky soft, and golden yellow from the egg yolks.

Today, two recipes for beans from the Dorotheenkloster MS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7ruwsegjeee1.jpg?width=1476&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47c757b48c84454b445f5f3f41c28b956bf5798c\n\n***69 Mashed beans (prein von pon)***\n\n***Take the beans and make them pretty (shell them) with lye.

[Plain boiled](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/19/beans-in-a-pfeffer-sauce/) or [roasted to crisp snacks](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/03/siculo-norman-snack-beans/), ground into flour or mashed into puree, they were eaten by everybody. Served according to these recipes, they would be fit for a lordly table, but they were still humble beans and would never play a starring role.\n\nWe clearly see the artistry at work here. Even though the dish is humble, it is prepared with care and attention to detail. The right consistency, the proper colour, the right presentation matters. In the first recipe, the beans are served as a white mash either mixed with or \u2013 I think more likely \u2013 served along with a [plant milk](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/19/various-faux-cheeses/). The phrase \u201cof whatever kind you can get\u201d suggests that nut, almond, or seed milk would be fine. The dish is fit for fast days, so dairy would be inappropriate. The second dish is a *Mus*, a spoonable dish served warm. Again, the use of pea broth and oil instead of meat broth and butter tells us is it a fast day food.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Pound parsley and pass it through with eggs and the broth or the chickens. Put the same broth into a pan into a clean pan and stir it until it develops foam. Season it with pepper, cinnamon, and sugar so it is neither too sweet nor too sour. Add a little verjuice or vinegar and pour it over the chicken quarters.***\n\nThe recipe itself makes sense to modern readers, of course: It\u2019s cooked chicken in an egg-bound sauce (we would probably prefer to use starch, but eggs were considered an unalloyed good thing in Renaissance German cuisine). How it would be classed as a soup is a different matter.\n\nIt bears repeating that a soup at the time was a liquid dish intended to be served with bread. Indeed, the connection is so close that the word *Suppe* is sometimes used for the bread sops rather than the liquid. This is a substantial meat dish \u2013 a quarter chicken was traditionally considered a full portion \u2013 but its liquid component makes it suitable to serve over bread, thus as a soup. We can imagine a bed of sops or a substantial bread slice topped with a chicken quarter and covered in a generous scoop of spicy, yellow-green \u2013 soup. We would call it a sauce and serve it with rice or potatoes, but we have lost the sense of the centrality of bread to every meal that sixteenth-century Germans still felt.\n\nThe flavour profile sounds enticing: a substantial chicken broth, the richness of an egg liaison, the tang of parsley, pepper, and verjuice balancing the soothing depth of cinnamon and a hint of sweetness. It is probably easy to overdo the sugar, and I am quite sure many Renaissance cooks did.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gfwn4s/chicken_in_parsley_soup_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1730320645.0, "score": 16, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gfwn4s/chicken_in_parsley_soup_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "A Sixteenth-Century Meal Plan (1547/1573)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/29/a-sixteenth-century-meal-plan/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/29/a-sixteenth-century-meal-plan/)\n\nLike many cities throughout medieval Germany, Hamburg had a *Spital*. These charitable religious foundations were initially intended to provide shelter or permanent homes to the indigent and sick, but they tended to turn into a kind of retirement home. Though some beds were usually reserved for the indigent, many people would purchase a berth, usually known as a prebend (*praebenda*), with a gift of cash or land to the *Spital* and take it up as age rendered them infirm to receive food, shelter, and clothing in a religious institution for the rest of their lives. Most *Spit\u00e4ler* catered to the urban middle classes, people who could afford a valuable gift, but not so rich that caring for elderly infirm at home would be feasible for the next generation.\n\n[Drawings of the Spital from Gaedechens' article](https://preview.redd.it/7ix99r19ni3d1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4c4c2ad5425d345358a46aec457da3015f5425f)\n\nThe [Heilig-Geist-Spital in Hamburg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_zum_Heiligen_Geist_(Hamburg)) was of this type. First attested in 1227, the foundation actually[ continues to function as a retirement home to this day](https://www.hzhg.de/), though the original buildings have long been destroyed and the institution follows modern procedures now. The longevity of this body led to an unusually large amount of documents surviving, though much of this trove was destroyed in the 1943 bombing raids. Fortunately, a large part of the evidence was first recorded in the kind of extensive, obsessively detailed study 19th-century German historians were famous for. F.C. Gaedechens wrote Geschichte des Hospitals zum Heiligen Geist in Hamburg in the Zeitschrift des Vereins f\u00fcr Hamburgische Geschichte, vol. 8 (1889) and it is now[ freely accessible in digital form](https://digitalisate.sub.uni-hamburg.de/recherche/detail?tx_dlf%5Bid%5D=14332&tx_dlf%5Bpage%5D=1&tx_dlf_tableofcontents%5Baction%5D=main&tx_dlf_tableofcontents%5Bcontroller%5D=TableOfContents&cHash=b42fdc2ad2433966c03038e49e74ebe5). Among enormous amounts of data on the administration, architecture, financing, and political history of the Spital, he includes the full details of its meal plan. That is what I want to look at mainly here.\n\n**The Speiseordnung of 1547**\n\nUnfortunately, there is little written evidence of the food served at the *Spital* in the first centuries of its existence. The first surviving rules were written down after it had passed from the custody of the Franciscan friars into that of the Protestant church establishment after Reformation. This transition seems to have been largely amicable, with several friars staying on in ecclesiastical positions in the new Lutheran world, but the new administrative structures required records of a system that beforehand ran in a much more haphazard fashion. It is thus likely, though not certain, the *Speiseordnung* of 1547, reiterated in 1573, consists largely of what was established standard. This is what it stipulated:\n\n**Sundays**\n\nMidday meal:\n\nFirst course: cabbage between Whitsun and Christmas, otherwise beans or peas\n\nSecond course: porridge of milk and wheat bread\n\nThird course: *grapenbraden* of ox, mutton, lamb, or pork depending on the season\n\nEvening meal: uncooked bacon or ox tripe or pork or mutton sausages, two eggs each, and oatmeal porridge with milk\n\n**Mondays**\n\nMidday meal: millet, oatmeal or buckwheat porridge with butter\n\nEvening meal: green cheese or fresh milk cheese and oatmeal porridge\n\n**Tuesdays**\n\nAs Sunday\n\n**Wednesdays**\n\nMidday meal: oatmeal porridge and dried fisch (*rotsch\u00e4r* or *klippfisch*) with butter, but fresh fish is they can be had\n\nEvening meal: cheese and oatmeal porridge\n\n**Thursdays**\n\nAs Sunday\n\n**Fridays**\n\nMidday meal: oatmeal porridge with salt fish (*rothsch\u00e4r*, *salzfisch* or *schollen*) with butter and one salt herring each, as well as one *Pfennigweggen* (fine wheat loaf worth one penny).\n\n(Footnote: Household records show salt herrings were smoked in quantity, so kippers may have been served after Lent)\n\nEvening meal: none\n\n**Saturdays**\n\nMidday meal: oatmeal porridge or rice and butter\n\nEvening meal: oatmeal porridge and cheese\n\nIn addition to regular meals, there was a bread issue. One rye bread loaf of 2 lbs (or a bread allowance of 8 *Pfennige* if baking was not possible) was given to each inmate daily. It is likely, though not recorded, that butter was also issued or provided at meals.\n\n**Holiday Meals and Bequests**\n\nWhile these were the regular meals served every week, by and large, there were interruptions to the schedule. For one thing, it is likely that seasonal variation was greater than admitted to here. A later *Speiseordnung* makes allowances for *Stint* (whitebait), strawberries, and other seasonal foods. Very likely that was common practice much earlier, unrecorded because it was a matter of course.\n\nHolidays provided the second occasion to interrupt the schedule. The *Spital* was a Christian institution and though it no longer observed strict fasts or Catholic Saints\u2019 Days, it was bound up in a deep tradition and the high holidays structured its year. The meals served on those occasions are recorded:\n\nOn the main holiday of Easter, Christmas and Whitsun, the Spital served two kinds of grapenbraden at midday, one \u201ewhite\u201c, the other *willbratt* (cooked in sour vinegar or saffron sauce) with cabbage or peas.\n\nThe Christmas evening meal consisted of *Sulte* (probably an aspic) and Sunday porridge with milk.\n\nThe Easter Sunday evening meal was porridge with two eggs or one sausage per person\n\nOn the second holiday \u2013 Boxing Day, Easter or Whit Monday \u2013 the regular meal schedule was followed, but for the evening meal, the kitchen made the porridge with 18 lbs of rice and 2 *Mark* worth of milk.\n\nOn the Saturday before Sexagesima and on Carnival (i.e. Shrove Tuesday), the inmates received *hetewegghe* (a rich, white breadroll) with milk.\n\nDespite the absence of a formal obligation on Lutherans, the Spital observed Lenten fast after a fashion and marked its beginning with festivities for Carnival. On Shrove Sunday, the weekend before Carnival, regular food was served, but on Shrove Monday, the inmates had *grapenbraden* along with their porridge, Of Shrove Tuesday, the midday meal consisted of cabbage or peas porridge and either *willbrat* or *schmoorfleisch*, two other dishes made with fresh meat. In the evening, every inmate received a *mettwurst* (a sausage made with sheer muscle meat) half an ell in length, or one and a half quarter ells if it was thick. This was served along with sweet (i.e. fresh) milk and *Stuten*, a soft, enriched white bread.\n\nLent began with Ash Wednesday. Following it, Saturday and Sunday followed the regular pattern, but on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, oatmeal porridge and boiled or fried herring, *rothsch\u00e4r* or salt fish was served at midday. Each inmate also received one salt herring. There was no evening meal on those days\n\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays in Lent, the midday meal was millet or oatmeal porridge with butter and the evening meal porridge and cheese.\n\nOn \u2018silent Friday\u2019 (Good Friday), the Spital served *Handbojnen* (possibly a kind of fritter looking like beans) in the morning and gave each inmate one pound of figs and warm beer porridge with oil.\n\nUnlike the other holidays, Easter was also marked by a specific bread issue. On Easter Sunday, everyone received one loaf of wheat bread weighing 2 \u00bd lbs.\n\nOn Easter Monday, the issue was *Sch\u00f6nroggen* bread, again at 2 \u00bd lbs.\n\nOn the following day, inmates received one round loaf of fine wheat or rye bread weighing 1 \u00bd lbs.\n\nOn Ascension day, everyone received dry (i.e. roasted, not boiled) meat, for which purpose 30 pieces were specifically bought.\n\nCommunion was taken communally four times a year. On those days, both the poor and the prebendaries received egg soup in addition to their regular rations.\n\nIn addition, there is one interesting annual tradition that the hospital established within its walls and continues to honour to this day. Before the Reformation, it was common for wealthy people and religious fraternities to establish regular, usually annual feasts or distribution of food, drink, clothing, or free baths to the poor. These were often to specific groups, set up through testaments and administered by religious institutions, and they constituted a regular feature of the year. During the Reformation, these bequests were folded into the general parish welfare system the church was now expected to provide. We have no records of them continuing.\n\nWithin the Spital, however, two new bequests for its inmates were established after the Reformation and continue to be distributed today. The first was set up by the administrator of the Spital (*Hofemester*) Bruno Degener in 1550. His will stipulated that two meals were to be given to the poor, prebendaries, and staff in his memory. The administrators of the municipal *Oberalten* committee in charge of welfare and the pastor of the parish church were invited to join the master at his table. In theory, this invitation still stands, though the Spital has long moved out of the old city\u2019s limits.\n\nOn Michaelmas (29 September), *schmoorfleisch* or, if preferred, *willbratt* of oxmeat prepared with good vinegar, enough spices, and 12 lbs raisins were served in addition to the regular meal of the day. In addition, one tun of beer was brought in for all to share, and each inmate and staff member received two small loaves of fine bread (*Blaffertwecken*).\n\nOn Annunciation Day (25 March, *Marien in der Fasten*), they were served salmon or sturgeon, fresh or boiled, or pike. If no fish could be had, *schmoorfleisch* or *willbratt* as for Michaelmas would be subvstituted. Again, they were given one tun of beer to share and two *Blaffertwecken* each.\n\nOn both those occasions, 18 lbs rice and two *Marks* worth of milk would be cooked into porridge for the evening meal.\n\nThe second bequest is less well attested, but amply documented in practice. It was made by the otherwise unknown Dorothea Rathlau or Maria Rathlow (this is the same person \u2013 wide variation in names is not uncommon in Early Modern sources). It was most likely made after 1550, but before 1576 and added to the meal on Annunciation day a dish of veal soup with bread, veal, and dumplings of flour and green herbs (the dumplings were made with raisins after 1760). A further issue of beer and white bread in the evening was also provided.\n\nBeer was brewed on site and provided as needed, with no specific rules for quantities, but a repeated admonition not to overindulge. Each inmate received four sacks of coal annually to heat their room and was permitted to take hot embers from the main fireplaces twice daily.\n\nTo put this into its proper context, we need to understand the people who ate these meals. Unfortunately, we do not know how many prebendaries or poor the Heilig-Geist-Spital housed at the time these ordinances were written down. The number of poor inmates was significantly expanded to 114 in the early 17th century, so it was clearly lower then. Prebends sold for significant sums, but were still affordable to the middle classes. Thus, the food must have met the expectations of the craftsmen and small traders of the city, and this matches what we know about the diet of the urban populations of sixteenth-century Germany. If anything, the standards in Hamburg were less generous than in other institutions that served meat daily. The comparison to the standards of real wealth is made evident when we consider that the committee of the administrators \u2013 civic dignitaries all \u2013 holding court day in the village of Barmbek on the Feast of St. James (25 July) every year, this body of two councillors, two procurators, and 16 parish representatives received 32 chickens and 6 lambs which the peasants were required to provide as part of their rent. This is a different level of consumption altogether.\n\n**Thoughts on Dishes Served**\n\nThe mainstay of the diet was grain, served in the shape of bread and porridge. The bread is interesting in the gradations provided: Plain rye bread, probably the kind referred to in other sources as *spisebrod*, was issued daily. This was the daily bread of most people and subject to price controls and official regulation. Since the *Spital* stipulated loaves of a given weight, they had to be baked specifically. Bread baked for the market had a fixed cost per loaf and varied in weight on a sliding scale determined by grain prices.\n\nOn holidays and special occasions, the *Spital* served *Sch\u00f6nroggen*, a fine rye bread that often had a characteristic shape with three round sides and one developed into a point. These loaves were typically sized to be individual portions, though the record here suggests they were again baked larger and to a specific weight for the needs of the *Spital*.\n\nWheat bread was more special still, reserved for Sunday suppers and high holidays. Wheat did not grow well in Northern Germany, and though Hamburg imported large quantities of it from Bohemia and Saxony for its famous beer, it was always more expensive than local rye. The loaves for holiday issue are again identified by weight and thus likely specifically baked for the occasion, but the issues of *Pfennigwecken* and *Blaffertwecken* indicates they were bought in. These were small wheat loaves worth respectively one *Pfennig* and one *Blaffert*, small denominations that bought breadrolls of varying weight depending on the current grain price. The *hetewegghe* are actually first attested in the context of the Heilig-Geist-Spital. These most likely were a [kind of enriched breadrolls served with milk or cream, ancestors of today\u2019s *Hei\u00dfwecken* and *semla*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/21/heiswecken-an-exercise-in-speculation/).\n\nPorridge, too, comes in gradations, the finest being made with rice or wheat bread and milk. Rice, of course, had to be imported and enjoyed special status among the porridge grains. Bread porridge, too, was more common than recipe collections suggest because it required no recipe. The simplest kind was made by soaking bread in water or beer and most likely served the inmates of the Spital for a meal whenever they were individually hungry. This is what is meant by the *Warmbier* of many sources. Other porridges are made with millet, oats, and buckwheat. These were more common fare, cooked according to the occasion with water, broth, or milk, which was a particular extravagance. Regular porridge was often served with butter, as familiar an accompaniment as bread. We know from various recipes that making porridge was understood to involve a degree of skill and knowledge, with varieties in its preparation affecting flavour and consistency. People likely were able to tell good porridge from bad. It was not the tasteless gruel of workhouse myth, but a proper and appreciated meal.\n\nVegetables are attested rarely, and almost never spoken about much. Cabbage, beans, and peas represented unexciting fare, most likely sourced from the gardens the Spital ran just outside the city walls. Vegetable dishes did not enjoy high status in Germany then. Horticulture as a pursuit of the leisure class had only begun to come in from Italy, and most gardens were limited to basic foods. However, it is likely that a wider variety than this was brought in seasonally and cooked with the food or served alongside it. This would not be recorded because people did not consider it of great significance. Onions, garlic, apples, pears, parsley, carrots, turnips or radishes would come in from the gardens and be eaten together with the food that mattered.\n\nThe food that mattered above all was animal protein: meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Milk is mainly recorded as an ingredient in porridge, cheese and butter stipulated on numerous days. Much of the meat served likely was preserved. We know that the Spital, like wealthy urban householders, [bought entire oxen and hogs in winter and had them slaughtered and salted for the coming year](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/29/salt-beef-hanseatic-style-meat-preservation-part-8/).\n\nFresh meat was a rarer treat. *Grapenbraden* was made with fresh meat cut into pieces and slowly stewed in a large three-legged metal cooking pot, the eponymous grapen. This was a feast day dish that people of relatively modest means enjoyed and it is often stipulated at the feasts artisans hold in their guilds. Having it every Sunday was, if not extravagant, then certainly indicative of stable finances. Meanwhile, the rarer *Schmoorfleisch* and *Willbrat* were more refined dishes. The first is unclear, but may mean meat cooked in larger pieces and sliced like a roast. *Willbrat* literally means venison, but here clearly refers to a preparation methods, not actual game meat. We have numerous such [recipes, usually involving seasoned sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/28/faking-venison-from-beef/). The vinegar, spices, and raisins listed in the bequest of Bruno Degener fit this type well.\n\nSausages are stipulated more rarely, but the *Mettwurst* mentioned for Easter represented a treat. At the time, this did not yet mean a type of charcuterie, as it does today, but any sausages made with sheer muscle meat as opposed to organ meat, blood, and fillers. The [equivalent South German term was *Bratwurst*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/22/experiments-in-sausage-making-ii-bratwurst-after-sabina-welser/). The sausages served for Sunday supper more likely were of the latter kind.\n\nFish, too, plays a significant role. This is not surprising in a port city like Hamburg, situated at the crossing of trade routes carrying dried cod from Norway and Iceland, salt herring from Skan\u00f6r, and [dried soles from the Baltic](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/02/rumpolt-on-cooking-plateissen/). The lion\u2019s share of the fish served was of this preserved kind, [dried cod](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/18/stockfish-from-meister-eberhard/) (*Rotsch\u00e4r* or *Klippfisch*), soles, and salt herring, the latter[ possibly smoked](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/15/tanned-smoked-herring-from-the-oeconomia/). Fresh fish was served more rarely, and always with the reservation that it may not be available. The festive serving of sturgeon, salmon, or pike bequeathed by Bruno Degener represented real luxury.\n\nWhile we should not assume that spices or dried fruit were only served on the occasions they are specified \u2013 figs for Easter, raisins and spices with the Degener bequest \u2013 it is clear that these things, though they appear commonplace in our recipe sources, were unusual in the lives of most people.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the beer for daily consumption would not have been very strong. As *Hausbier*, brewed for domestic consumption, it did not have to meet the quality standards of commercial brewing. Hamburg beer of export quality \u2013 *Seebier* \u2013 was made with a very high proportion of malt to water and would have been a rather alcoholic, substantial, and probably very sweet drink. Even the less intense variety approved for sale within the region was stronger and richer that homebrew.

Various Kalinago groups coexisted  with the French colonists in the Antilles in the late 17th century and  relations were often friendly. Labat describes numerous meetings and  proved an [interested ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/06/pere-labats-banana-pastilles/)[observer](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/11/buccaneer-cuisine-breaded-palm-grubs/).  His short description can be fleshed out with references to other parts  of Labat\u2019s writings and parallel sources. We can thus arrive at a broad  reconstruction of a feast very different from the foodways of the  Native Americans of the mainland [described by Lionel Wafer](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/01/lionel-wafer-describes-native-american-cooking/).\n\nThe Kalinago Labat met were a maritime civilisation. The sea provided  them with the mobility they prized and the high-status foods of their  culture, though they likely got more of their calories from cassava and  plantains than fish or crustaceans.  On this festive occasion, seafood  reigns. Along with roasted cassava root, the men are served boiled crabs  and two varieties of roast fish. The [*coffre* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostraciidae)is most likely some variety of boxfish while the \u201cfish with large scales\u201d may be a [tarpon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpon).  Labat tried both on other occasions and wrote approvingly of their  culinary qualities, though he admits not everyone appreciated them.\n\nFinally, there are the condiments. The taumalin of the crabs is[ an internal organ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomalley)removed  from cooked crabs. Labat misidentifies it as the milt and writes that  it is processed into a sauce with lemon juice, salt, and chili pepper. *Pimentade* is  a kind of sauce described in many sources as very widespread among both  Native Americans and European colonists. If we can trust Labat\u2019s  description, the Kalinago prepared it from boiled cassava juice, grated  chili pepper, and lemon juice.\n\nInterestingly, the descriptions of buccaneer feasts we find in a  number of sources often share features with the way Native Americans  cooked and ate, and descriptions of Native American cookery often  include ingredients and occasionally techniques that were imported from  the Old World.\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/14rkz3v/a_kalinago_feast_c_1680/", "created_utc": 1688585861.0, "score": 17, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/14rkz3v/a_kalinago_feast_c_1680/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Then take good sweet wine and prepare a good sauce (*****suppelin*****) for them.***\n\nDishes made with chopped or groud meats are not uncommonly found in medieval recipe collections, representing the kind of inventive and labour-intensive cuisine the wealthy relished. This one is not uncommon. It uses veal, an expensive meat, and is heavily spiced, soit is in no way economical as ground meat dishes after the invention of mechanical grinders often are. An interesting point is the way cloves are supposed to predominate both in the spice mix and stuck about the surface decoratively. I assume, though this is not stated, that the parboiled meat would be stuck on spits and roasted over the fire to brown the surface and crisp the larding before being served.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/08/a-ground-veal-roast/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/08/a-ground-veal-roast/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1h9qfwc/veal_meat_loaf_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1733685612.0, "score": 16, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1h9qfwc/veal_meat_loaf_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["When it says good spices .. what are those good spices other than the cloves ."]}

Pass the prepared ingredients through a sieve all together with the milk. Then make a dough of flour, sugar, and rosewater. Grease the pan with fat beforehand to prevent it burning. Make the dough as thin as paper, lay it over the pan, and place the tart or rather the abovementioned ingredients on it. Put an edge (Reuffelin) on it above all sprinkle rosewater on the tart. Beaten egg white is spread on it with a small feather, and finally sugar is sprinkled on, never stint the latter. Cover the pan and the tart diligently with a covering (\u00fcberleg) and set coals above it as is needed. That way, the rosewater, egg white, and sugar will harden and draw together like a crust and the tart will be as good as marzipan.***\n\nWhiteness was a desired quality in fashionable foods, so this tart is particularly distinguished by that and, secondarily, by being sweet. Beyond that, I am not entirely clear on how it is supposed to work, but it sounds as though a custard based on egg whites is overlaid with a kind of meringue topping. For greater certainty, I would need to experiment with the recipe practically.\n\nAmong the things I do not know is the quantity of a *Seutel*. The seidel is usually a drinking vessel, so we are not looking at very large containers, but beyond that it is a matter of guessing at this point. A second point of uncertainty is whether the almonds are supposed to be passed through the cloth \u2013 remain in the liquid as a fine powder \u2013 or strained out, leaving only the oil and flavour. The resulting mixes could be very different.\n\nThere are, however, some very interesting points made here. A tart base made as thin \u2018as paper\u2019 (which even using sixteenth-century linen paper as a basis of comparison would be quite thin), a separate decorative edge added afterwards, and of course the topping. Adding sugar, rosewater, and beaten egg white separately rather than combined looks odd to modern eyes, but it just could work. We know similar techniques used with [marzipans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/) and [almond tarts](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/24/renaissance-nibbles-for-a-pity-party-iii/).\n\nClearly, the point to this recipe is a display of wealth \u2013 almonds, sugar, and a large number of eggs \u2013 and skill \u2013 the precise temperature control that would be needed for the tart to come out credibly \u2018white\u2019 from a baking dish. It isn\u2019t likely to have a very exciting taste, but will surely be sweet, soft, and rich, much as the owner of the book was expected to be.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gqkjoz/white_tart_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1731524399.0, "score": 16, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gqkjoz/white_tart_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["\"never stint the latter\" made me laugh\n\n\nThis sounds yummy!"]}

Salt it cleanly and thus leave it to stand in the salt for 3 days. Then take out the meat or tongues and wash off the blood with the salt water it has lain in. Lay the meat into a clean vessel. Then take the liquid, put it into a cauldron or pan, and put that over a fire to let it boil a little. When it begins to boil, scum it cleanly until it no longer develops foam. Then take it off the fire and let it cool. Then put the meat back into a clean container and pour the broth that has cooled again over it. It must not be warm, or the meat will spoil. Then let it lie 10 or 14 days in the brine. Take it out and hang it in the smoke as you know. That way it will turn nicely red and last long. Smoke it with juniper twigs (wech hallter bortzen).***\n\nThere is a fair amount of material on preserving meat which was an important part of feeding large and wealthy households. This recipe is not unique, but interesting in the way it emphasises the desired redness. That has not changed, and today German meat processors add potentially harmful nitrites to ham to give it that colour. Notably, this recipe does not suggest saltpetre, which we find in other early modern contexts, but relies on the salting and smoking process itself.\n\nIt makes sense to look at this recipe in the context of [later ones](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/30/salting-meat-for-garrison-troops-meat-preservation-bonus-episode/). [De Rontzier described drying salted meats](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/06/drying-meat-and-cooking-it-after-de-rontzier/) while [Johannes Coler](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/22/smoked-meat-from-the-oeconomia/) [wrote ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/23/brined-meat-from-the-oeconomia-meat-preservation-part-2/)[at length](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/24/short-term-solutions-meat-preservation-part-3/) [on various](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/25/another-wet-salting-recipe-meat-preservation-part-4/) [methods ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/26/salting-bacon-meat-preservation-part-5/)of [salting](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/27/smoking-meat-by-class-meat-preservation-part-6/) [meat ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/28/preserving-schmalz-meat-preservation-part-7/)and [ensuring](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/29/salt-beef-hanseatic-style-meat-preservation-part-8/) its [quality](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/21/adulterated-beef-a-warning-from-the-oeconomia/). The recipe from the Philippine Welser collection envisions a wet-salting process followed by smoking, and it again goes for the most luxurious cuts imaginable \u2013 tongues. Of course, Sabina Welser\u2019s manuscript has a similar recipe for salt-preserving beef tongues, so this is not out of the ordinary for the context, but we should remember that in a normal household, one ox tongue represented a considerable expense.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

{"title": "Egg Loaf Roast, an Illusion Food (c. 1450)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/14/egg-loaf-roast-from-the-innsbruck-ms/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/14/egg-loaf-roast-from-the-innsbruck-ms/)\n\n ***52 If you would make a roast of eggs, beat the eggs in a  bowl, season them, salt them, and pour them into a bag. Let them boil in  that so they turn very hard. Then take the egg, stick it on a spit,  roast them and lard (*****besteck*****) it with the egg so that it looks like larded etc.***\n\n***53 If you would make a venison roast (*****wild praten*****)  of eggs, prepare it like the (above) roast, but do not roast it and do  not baste it. Slice it as thick as a finger and serve a pepper sauce  over it etc***.\n\nThe medieval German corpus  is full of ways to turn things other than  meat into roasts. Usually, it is fish or legumes, which would be  permissible for Lent. Here, it is eggs, which makes these recipes  suitable only for times and places where egg and dairy are allowed,  called ember days in the English tradition. These rules were contentious  in Germany and  there very likely were many places where eggs were  eaten during fast before the Reformation, so the limitations of these  recipes were probably not that great. \n\nTechnically, this is quite challenging: First, you boil beaten egg in  a bag. This likely means fabric, as is recorded later for fritter  batter, most  likely a closely woven linen and possibly greased and/or  floured. Then you attach it to a roasting spit \u2013 not a trivial  accomplishment \u2013 and roast it carefully, preventing it from falling off  while you baste it and decorate it weith strips of hard-boiled egg white  to resemble lardons. The second recipe, serving it in  a sauce, is  a  lot less demanding. \n\nThese are also interesting because we learn about a few conventions  for regular dishes. Illusion food recipes are surprisingly often good  for that. First, the fact that egg white is used to resemble lardons  shows us that the bacon preferred for this was very fat, probably like  modern *R\u00fcckenspeck*. Second, venison roast would conventionally  be served in a sauce. This suggests that other recipes for faux venison  may be based largely on this convention. The food copied would have been  recognisable as deer because itz was served in a spicy *pfeffer*. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

The idea was to produce a meal from a few basic ingredients that would reflect both the technical limitations and the wealth of natural resources European settlers encounbtered in the early Caribbean colonies. The result was very pleasant.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkfgxhyovlqd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8a53c81255735fae4a185497e64baaa3da8e179\n\nThe centrepiece was albacore tuna, a fish that is mentioned approvingly in several descriptions. The preferred method of preparation, according to Jacques de Lery, was salting and roasting it, and many other accounts describe that most fish was cooked like this. Fish is quite expensive these days, so we were limited to small portions. Surely men who caught their own would have more. We roasted it in the oven and it was very good, even without the sauce Allemande de Lery would have liked with it (I am still not sure what that would have been, but surely not [what we know by that name today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allemande_sauce)).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryb4fbtqvlqd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3325d4a4a4846b10b821a2711e0fc87b3b3fe21\n\nTo accompany the albacore, we opted for plantain. Though not native to the Americas, this fruit is mentioned even in late 16th century accounts as being grown by Native American coastal communities who traded it to European sailors. The fruit was very popular and cookerd in a variety of ways, including roasted in the shell, as Jean-Baptiste Labat describes, or without as William Dampier describes. We shelled one and cut it into wedges that we then cooked at 200\u00b0C in an air frier (no fire was on hand) and left the other in its shell to roast with the fish in the oven. The wedges were pleasant enough, a bit like oven-baked potatoes, but the roasted plantain was a very positive surprise. The shell turned entirely black and burst, exposing the yellow flesh. It was soft, but not mushy, and not as dry as the pieces. I could absolutely see how this was popular with \u201chunters, boucaniers, and fishermen\u201d, as Labat writes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izxnujmsvlqd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=873d90a22a2d9d723808408fd659e329d1862b77\n\nFinally, we added sauces which apparently were commonly eaten. One was the obiuquitous pimentade sauce, in this iteration consisting merely of oil, chili pepper, and lemon juice, based on the account of Exquemelin. Apparently in some cases it was made with only citrus juice and chilis, which would be even more basic. The other is avocado sauce that is admittedly only described by Dampier. He mentions mashing it with lemon juice and sugar, and I made this in a rather sweet version before. this time, we tried to have the lemon predominate and that resulted in a sour, refreshing, and quite tangy mash. The version that Dampier specifically mentions as eaten with plantains had only salt, but since Labat states that avocado should be eaten with salt and pepper, we went with the added flavour boost. It was good, though I preferred the lemony version.\n\nAll of it went together well and fed two people very felicitously.

{"title": "Rules for Cookpots (14th/15th c.)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/06/03/rules-for-cookpots/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/06/03/rules-for-cookpots/)\n\nJust a short post today, but this is one of the little things that I so enjoy finding. I was writing about the [massive *grapen* cookpots](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/31/a-sixteenth-century-institutional-kitchen/), three-legged bronze vessels that stood in the embers of the fire, at the kitchen of the [Heilig-Geist-Spital in Hamburg](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/29/a-sixteenth-century-meal-plan/). Through the sheer weight of metal that went into them, these were expensive and long-lived items, but they were also widespread enough for the Hanseatic cities to support entire guilds of the artisans who made them. It is from the records of one of these, the Hamburg guild of pewter and bronze casters that we get regulations for the material from which their products must be made.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0bsnqs5ue4d1.jpg?width=3535&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fef819af2b405e5d555e1aacced097aadbfc2ca3\n\n\n\nThe 1357 ordinances specify:\n\n***Pewter casters are to produce bottles, bowls, saltcellars and footed dishes from pure tin without lead. However, if the tin is too hard (i.e. brittle) so it cannot be cast without lead, they may properly add a sixtieth or fiftieth part of lead, depending on how hard it is, and no more than that. They may add a fourth part of lead when casting pitchers, but if anyone should wish to have them made from pure tin, they may do that, too.***\n\nFurther down, the document also records an agreement made between the guilds of the cities of L\u00fcbeck, Hamburg, Rostock, Stralsund, Wismar, Greifswald and Stettin (Szczecin) in 1354. Is specifies:\n\n***Grapen must be cast with soft copper, with the addition of half recycled grapen metal (*****gropenspise*****) or 4 Livonian pounds (28.4 lbs) of tin to each Schiffspfund (136 lbs) of copper, without any lead. Grapen must be marked.***\n\nA further agreement of 1368 adds:\n\n***Grapen may also be cast from good, hard and pure copper that has half recycled metal (*****spise*****) added. Lead must be added to this.***\n\nFinally, we have an addition made in 1444 noting the council of L\u00fcbeck agreed with its guild of bronzecasters that grapen can also be made from different materials, namely using a mixture of 3 lbs of soft copper to 1 lb of hard copper. Where the prized soft copper was not on hand, 2 lbs of Swedish copper could be used to each 1 lb of hard copper. The text adds that all soldering must be done with tin, never with lead.\n\nAt first sight, this does not make much sense to a modern reader used to the idea of getting materials in a pure and standardised form, but it provides a fascinating insight into the struggles of craftsmanship in an age before industrial supplies. Clearly there was an interest in ensuring standardisation and the purity of the metal that people paid large sums for. Notably, the regulations \u2013 most likely instigated by the city councils \u2013 also show that people were concerned about lead being added to the metal. The regularity with which this is repeated suggests it was more than the suspicion of paying high prices for substandard material. Most likely, they understood the health implications at some level.\n\nAt the same time, the regulations show a pattern that is drearily familiar today. A ban on lead, very likely initially intended to be complete, is riddled with exceptions as it faces the practical realities of the industry. After all, you could not just order any quantity and grade from a [reputable copper merchant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir). Metal was simply not available in its pure form, and the products of different mines varied in their qualities due to their composition. Clearly, the coveted soft copper was not in unlimited supply, and after 14 years, the councils relented and allowed the use of less promising material with an admixture of lead.\n\nThe pewter casters are under a similar injunction. They must not add lead to their tin unless it is absolutely necessary \u2013 in this case the permission is given immediately, not after a span of years, but the quantity is clearly defined and quite small, between 1.7% and 2%. It is horrifying by comparison to find 25% lead permitted to be added to *kannen* (pitchers), but of course these were used daily and subjected to considerable stress. No doubt the practicality of making them from a softer, more malleable alloy that would not tear when bent outweighed other concerns. Lead is, after all, an extremely useful and pleasant material to work with. Wine served in these pitchers must even have tasted sweeter than from pure tin ones, and it is doubtful the creeping effect of their toxicity would have been noticeable. We are not the first generation to face this kind of test \u2013 nor to fail it.\n\nFinally, it is not surprising that all agreements specify a large proportion of recycled metal in the bronze mix. Medieval society could not afford to be wasteful, and the economic ecosystem of a medieval city found profitable uses for almost anything. An old metal pot, broken or battered beyond the willingness of the poorest to use, would be turned into a new one.\n\nThe relevant texts (and much more material of interest) can be found in Otto R\u00fcdiger: Die \u00e4ltesten hamburgischen Zunftrollen und Br\u00fcderschaftsstatuten, Lucas Gr\u00e4fe, Hamburg 1874", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1d7di9h/rules_for_cookpots_14th15th_c/", "created_utc": 1717443801.0, "score": 15, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1d7di9h/rules_for_cookpots_14th15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "A Sixteenth-Century Institutional Kitchen", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/31/a-sixteenth-century-institutional-kitchen/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/31/a-sixteenth-century-institutional-kitchen/)\n\nWe looked at [the 1547 meal plan of the Heilig-Geist-Spital in Hamburg](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/29/a-sixteenth-century-meal-plan/) before. However, there is another interesting resource. Its fortunate survival allows us a glimpse of the kitchen in which all of these meals were produced. Kitchen inventories are rare except in the context of probate estates, and those are usually quite limited. However, when the Spital was handed over to the committee of the Oberalten in 1528 as part of Bugenhagen\u2019s Lutheran church reform, a list of all properties and possessions was made. Such lists also still exist for a number of other church institutions, preserved again not in the original, but in Staphorst\u2019s source collection, the 1723-29 Historia Ecclesiae Hamburgensis Diplomatica. As in so many cases in the history of Hamburg, the losses of 1842 and 1943 are only partly made up by the work of the city\u2019s historians.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y35vw7apst3d1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b705a740b0d1f73bc1810be82af1eb7d116f689\n\nThe kitchen equipment in the Spital is recorded with a view to its value as a household asset here, listing metal vessels by weight. This was commonly done with larger kitchen gear whose mass of bronze or copper represented its resale value. Some of the pieces are quite large.\n\n**In the kitchen:**\n\n6 large *grapen* of 339 lbs (at about 55 lbs apiece, quite substantial)\n\n2 small *grapen* of 25 lbs (a quarter the weight, about as much as my biggest potjie)\n\n1 large *Sch\u00fcsselgrapen* (wider than the usual) of 105 lbs\n\n3 large cauldrons of 29 lbs\n\n2 small cauldrons of 12 lbs\n\n1 large cauldron holding 3 tuns of water of 65 lbs\n\n1 cauldron holding 2 zuber of water of 44 lbs\n\n1 cauldron holding 1 zuber of 22 lbs\n\n2 long dripping pans (*Bratschapen*), not usable\n\n1 colander and cauldron of 14 lbs\n\n1 chopper\n\n1 *bankschive* (metal tray?) and slaughtering knife\n\n2 spits, one long one short\n\n2 old spits\n\n1 water ladle\n\n1 large and 1 small griddle\n\n1 brass lid of 10 lbs\n\n**At the baking house:**\n\n1 large cauldron of 23 lbs\n\n4 small cauldrons of 23 lbs (6 lbs each)\n\n1 large mortar of 35 lbs\n\nObviously, this is not a complete list. It lacks the majority of articles of daily use \u2013 the wooden coopered and lathe-turned bowls, the earthenware pitchers, pots, and cups, the wooden spoons, cutting boards, ladles and whisks, and the tables and benches all the work was done on. All of these were effectively articles of consumption, things that used up over time, and thus not considered assets the way metal gear was. The kitchen certainly had these things and must have regularly restocked them.\n\nWhat is listed here is considerable wealth. Such stocks of kitchen gear, much like lands and treasuries, accumulated over generations in the hands of the church where they were never divided up in inheritance. We know from recorded wills that wealthy people sometimes left pieces of their kitchen equipment or silverware to the church, and this likely explains some of the eclectic nature of this collection. This source also demonstrates how long-lived some of these items could be: The same reform process that delivered the *Heilig-Geist-Spital* to the secular clergy also took the estate of the cathedral chapter. The list of their *domus panum* includes several items that can be identified with reasonable certainty in wills dating almost a century earlier. This is not unexpected \u2013 I use a pair of pots and a kitchen knife that are about a century old myself \u2013 but it shows clearly how long cooking pots could last. As an aside, we know from its early 16th-century statutes that the cooks\u2019 guild of Hamburg required new members to add a piece of equipment to the communal store of cooking and serving gear, so the principle also applied in secular contexts.\n\nLooking at the equipment in detail, the first thing to notice is the predominance of vessels for wet cooking processes. Large, heavy three-legged cooking pots to stand in the embers (*grapen*) and thinner vessels designed to suspend over the fire (*ketel*) are the largest and most numerous items. The larger ones, weighing in at over 100 pounds in the case of the wider-mouthed *Sch\u00fcsselgrapen* and over 50 in that of the other large ones \u2013 are legitimately enormous, but even a regular-sized one at 12 pounds was not exactly convenient to handle. This is about the weight of a 5-litre potjie, though bronze could potentially have held more in a somewhat thinner-walled vessel than cast iron. Meanwhile, a potjie of around 100 lbs \u2013 the second largest size that seems to be produced \u2013 holds about 60 litres today. You can produce a lot of porridge or stew in one of those.\n\nThe cauldrons are designed to hold more liquid. While we do not know exactly which tun measure is referred to here (there are several), the largest one holds at two tuns at least 350 litres, upwards of 500 if \u2013 improbably \u2013 the largest tun measure is assumed. A container this large may have been intended for brewing rather than cooking, though this would be an unusual use of the word *ketel*. Hamburg was a brewing city, and the vessels used for that were usually referred to as pans (*panne*). Again unfortunately we do not know which measure a zuber represents, but it puts the larger of the two at between 100 and 200 litres, the smaller one between 50 and 100. Guesstimating from these already speculative figures, the smaller cauldrons recorded would then hold anything between 10 and 30 litres, a good size for a household, but more suitable for side dishes in an establishment the size of the Spital.\n\nGriddles, spits, a colander, and various other instruments round out the equipment. Clearly, though the Spital kitchen was able to provide roasts if called upon, that was not what it was set up for. The absence of pans seems more surprising, but you can easily fry things in a *grapen*. It is interesting that the only mortar recorded is found in the bakehouse. Perhaps that was just where it stood \u2013 moving the 35-lb hunk of metal cannot have been a welcome task \u2013 but there may also not have been much call for one in the day-to-day operation of a kitchen that neither produced much in the way of complex delicacies not routinely ground spices.\n\nWe also have a record of serving gear and silver kept at the Spital. Unlike the kitchen listr, though, this one must be read with some caution. We know from a different listing that a significant quantity of serving gear, including tableclothes and candleholders, were held at the Spital\u2019s chapel and may have been used for festive occasions. What we have here may just be the basic things they did not bother moving every time. The Spital had the following on their premises:\n\n**In the Hall:**\n\n6 large handwashing basins of 32 lbs (5.5 lbs each)\n\n2 ewers of 22 lbs (11 lbs each)\n\n2 candlesticks of 28 lbs (14 lbs each)\n\n3 fire baskets and one additional candlestick\n\n14 grapen of 47 lbs\n\n2 wreath-shaped and 2 crown-shaped candelabra of 6 candle holders each\n\n28 pitchers\n\n7 additional pitchers kept in the office\n\n32 eating bowls (*N\u00e4pfe*)\n\n29 serving bowls (*Kohlsch\u00fcsseln und Salferen*)\n\n20 plates\n\n3 bowls\n\n6 small pitchers\n\n4 brass *St\u00fclper* (candle extinguishers)\n\n7 small *grapen* and pitchers, not weighed\n\n5 bellows\n\n6 seat cushions\n\n1 long and 1 short bench cover\n\n1 cupboard, 1 *Schenkschive* (serving tray?)\n\n19 old chair cushions\n\n\n\n**Silver tableware at the Spital:**\n\n1 large silver drinking cup\n\n1 bowl decorated with a face\n\n1 bowl decorated with a rose\n\n1 bowl decorated with a face and angels\n\n1 bowl bearing the names of the three Magi\n\n4 silver pitcher\n\n1 silver cup\n\n1 silver fork and pen\n\n1 silver scoop\n\n9 silver spoons\n\n3 broken spoons\n\n(total weight 135 *Loth* 2 *Quentin*,a little over 2 kg. The silver in the church weighs several times that).\n\nThis is an eclectic mix, but in that, it is not atypical. Many recorded sets of silverware consisted of individual pieces accumulated over time, not the matching sets from the 18^(th) and 19^(th) century we are used to seeing in museums and stately homes today. Since the Spital was a charity operated by Franciscan friars, it is unlikely any of it was purchased. Most likely, the pieces were left to the Spital in wills and kept as a store of wealth as much as for use.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1d560mk/a_sixteenthcentury_institutional_kitchen/", "created_utc": 1717189063.0, "score": 14, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1d560mk/a_sixteenthcentury_institutional_kitchen/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Work is crazy.  \n\n \n\n***139 To prepare a sauce naturally (*****nat\u00fcrlich*****)***\n\n***If you wish to prepare a natural sauce, take three heads  of garlic and more pepper than ginger. Temper this together and let it  become brown. That is called a natural sauce. You shall eat it in cold  weather.***\n\nThis is an interesting and potentially quite good recipe if enjoyed  in moderation. It makes sense, by contemporary lights, to eat it in cold  weather since its intense spices were considered warming. What I cannot  quite fathom is why it was called \u2018natural\u2019 (nat\u00fcrlich). At the time,  this was not the antonym of \u2018artificial\u2019, but rather usually referred to  the nature of something, its inherent qualities. There may  be  something missing in transmission. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set  of manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is  a note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

There is also evidence for the modern habit of making the fish  into dumplings instead of laboriusly putting it back into the fish skin.  However, since German audiences would have understood the recipe title  as a description rather than a proper name, these are referred to quite  prosaically as[ fish dumplings](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/17/fish-balls-from-the-inntalkochbuch/). \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

I will teach you as best I myself understand it how to  honourably keep house. First of all, you shall try to carry a second  house built of silver with you so you can buy, as you unavoidably will,  hay, fodder, straw, wine, grain, wood, millet and*** **kraut**, ***that is the custom, beans, peas, barley,*** **smaltz**,  ***lentils, dried meat, salt, household goods and bedding, cheese, fruit,  and many other things, each in its time. That will always prove useful.  And only ever buy the best if you do not want to regret your purchase***.\n\n***Feasting and invitations every day \u2013 that brings honour  once and damage twice. Do not spend your estate with guests on  musicians, and jewelry if you wish to keep your belongings and good  name, that is my teaching. But expenditures on knighthood are very  honourable, you must know, and especially have pity on your poor friend  (i.e. the speaker).***\n\n***Do not build houses at any price unless you are forced  to. A built house, a book filled with writing, a woman one has slept  with, cloth that has been cut, and pots full of old stuff (hefen alter plunder)  are valued so little it is a wonder. A dripping roof can be repaired;  Small damage is better than large. Honourable clothing, not too  elaborate, is praiseworthy if it is clean, not beshitten (beschissen), well mended and not torn, and suitable for the season. The latest fashion is worn by (reit, literally: rides on) fools only.***\n\n***You shall be glad to hear chickens crying and geese  singing, because you gain from them. Your dog shall be a strong male who  loyally guards what is yours. Spending money on training your children  is also good, and also do not stint on their dowry (haimsteur).  If you give to the poor, this (merit) will follow you to your grave,  but see your profit is much greater than your daily expenses. Something  can always happen that eats up the savings of a long time quickly.***\n\n***I will forthrightly tell you how to secure gain and avert  damage: Be the master in your own house. If your wife wears the pants,  she will be your hail and your curse before God and His commandments.  And you will be mocked for it. Thus watch her closely (sitz ir auf dem nak,  lit: sit on her neck) and hold her like a fox in a net. Make her  carefully preserve what is given into her hands. Also see to it that  kitchen, table, and bed are well kept and clean from the start if she  wishes to grow old with you. Oder her to clean, sew, spin, milk and  suckle*** (**s\u00e4ugen** ***\u2013 probably breastfeed infants) if you wish to  amount to something. Rarely allow her to be idle. And you must  understand the same applies to your daughters from the start. If they do  not know how, see that they learn it soon, day and night, as speedily  as four people. For what your wife can do for you is also good for  another man (i.e. their future husband).***\n\n***Do not give the travellers\u2019 staff to your son, and Saint  Bernard says. Quickly teach him a craft as you can, or trading, but  above all reading and writing if you want to secure him a position. But  if he does not properly achieve anything with you, send him away; That  is his*** **steuer** ***(dower).***\n\n***If you have servants in your care, do not supper pride (\u00fcbermuot) from them. Also trust no flatterer (gleichsner).  Note, a servant should be obedient, loyal, able to work long, chaste  and patient, not too rich, smart and speedy without complaint. But they  must also have an honourable master who rewards them enough \u2013 coarse  food as is their due \u2013 and does not withhold their wages overnight  because he can. Thus pay and feed them well, and see that they earn  their keep. If you would have certain gain, rise early with them and see  to your livestock yourself if you do not want to lose it. Do you know  what I know? Your own eye makes your cattle fat. But if you are lazy in  your own affairs, so will be your servants and, which is worse, they  will incline to evil thought.***\n\n***When you leave your house, be aware of what you have to  do, and when you return, check what has been taken from it. And if your  grain has not increased, know that you have lost that day.***\n\n***If you have good neighbours, be glad. Be useful to them  as much as you can and your house will flourish for a long time. If you  would sell wine and grain, approach them first and sell it cheaper than  you would to strangers. I will also add: Sell as dearly as you can to  your enemies. That is your gain. You are avenged and no blood has flowed  \u2013 the best revenge.***\n\n***If you would sell part of your land or \u2013 when something  is for sale \u2013 add to it, guard against a co-owner who is more  influential than you or one whose reputation is not spotless if you want  to be without worry. But especially I will advise you: It is better to  suffer hunger than to sell your estate. Yet it is better, this is widely  agreed on, to sell part of your property than to give all of it in  surety to a usurer.***\n\n***Do not gladly borrow unless you know from whom. And if  you know them, borrow even less gladly. Those who put their trust in  borrowing will perish in great shame. Thus you can see that you should  be happy to repay.***\n\n***Therefore, if you are wise, make your will while you are  healthy so you pay your debts before the clergy has access to your  estate, and also do not forget your servants as the sick often do. Leave  to your wife what is her due. And tell her kindly, if God calls you to  himself, to conduct herself honourably for the sake of your children  and, if she can, remain without a husband in pious memory and for a  better (after-)life. But you shall not force her with an oath, with  money, or by other means, for a legitimate husband is better for a woman  than a lord or a servant as a lover. Also more readily support the  daughter and the small child than your grown sons who can maintain  themselves.***\n\n***Finally: If your sons would become merchants, advise them  to divide the heritage among them. This way they make a better profit.  If they would be artisans, let them do as they please. But if they wish  to be idle, tell them to stay together without dividing the estate. Each  separate head wants its hat and each single house its fire. I will say  no more.\u201d***\n\n(lines 5016-5200)\n\nDespite the Grobianic style of much of the poem, this speech, like the [earlier one by the physician](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/11/the-physicians-speech-from-wittenwilers-ring/),  is meant to be taken seriously. It is what contemporaries would have  seen as commonsense advice, though much of it clearly envisions a much  more substantial household than that of a peasant. Most likely it  reflects the perspective of the author, an educated and wealthy urban  professional.\n\nThe list of purchased items is interesting, though not unexpected,  and the focus on careful husbandry and economy indicates the values of  non-noble classes. Feasting and display are the ways of the nobility,  not of the burghers or the peasantry. The household is seen as an   economic unit designed to produce profit and accumulate wealth as  insurance against an uncertain and dangerous future. All of this is  familiar from many other sources.\n\nThe role of women in all of this, too, is conventional, and the focus  on future generations a universally shared value of the time. It in  interesting how little religion or the church feature here. The clergy  only appears as a danger to the inheritance, God as a general guardian  of decency. All of this seems very Early Modern and foreshadows the  anticlericalism and self-righteousness of the sixteenth century. It is  not surprising to learn that the author was an episcopal official versed  in canon law and intimately familiar with the inner workings of the  church.\n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem \u201aDer Ring\u2018 (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself to  translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners, but  would advise anyone with enough command of German to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11pmbm6/on_good_husbandry_c_1410/", "created_utc": 1678646912.0, "score": 15, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11pmbm6/on_good_husbandry_c_1410/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you for sharing this.

Lay the slices on a  bowl so that the almond is toasted. Then take thick milk, as thick as  possible, add a handful of sugar and beat it in a pot, thus it develops a  foam. Place the foam on the slices with the almond that are toasted so  that the almond batter rises. Make a high foam, thus it melts below and  the bread softens.

Put entire cloves into the filling. If you want to have enough for one mess, add two eggs. When the filling is properly prepared and also not too thin, make little dumplings out of it. Put the filling into the claws. Take meat broth and get it boil well in a pan. Then put the claws into it, and when you have put them in, take a cauldron fill it with clear broth, place the (meat-)balls into the claws and place them in the hot broth. That way they become crooked so they stay in place. Let them boil until they are done. Prepare a congealed (? geliberte) broth with it and do not let it boil away. Serve it.***\n\nChicken feet are edible and used to be [eaten everywhere chickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_feet) were, though today most Western culinary traditions frown on them and we export them to China. This recipe is interesting because of the care it takes and because its decorative inventiveness. The process is not entirely clear \u2013 the boiling process looks to be repeated unnecessarily, or perhaps a parboiling stage is meant by the first \u2013 but the intent looks clear enough. In the end, we have an aspic or thick broth with chicken feet, each one grasping a veal meatball.

Try it, if it is not strong enough with spices, season it more as long as it is not strong enough. It should be very dry. If you would have a little sugar in it, that is your choice.***\n\n***Then work it as dry as you can, roll or twist it into thin ribbons about as thick as a proper knife\u2019s back, cut it as thin as wood shavings (Hobelspaen) or very finely cut root vegetables. Roll out the ribbons of dough three or four fingers wide, then cut them across. That way you get different lengths. Lay it out on paper sheets and place it in a baking oven after the bread has come out, or in winter into a stove\u2019s inside (Ofenroehr oder kachel). Do not let it burn, but see that they turn nicely crisp to the extent that the dough allows because of the saffron.***\n\n***Keep them in a box in a dry place and they stay good for a quarter of a year or longer. When you have a weak meat soup, throw one or ten or twelve into it. And if you want to serve it, let it boil up once or three times, that way they swell up and the broth tastes very good. (Even) if it is not bad in itself, it becomes better still. Serve it over sops.***\n\n***Another***\n\n***Take a handful of these or more, as you please, put it into a small pot or glazed pan that is (big) enough, add good fat broth, cut parsley roots into it if you wish, leave them as is proper, put it on a platter with more broth so that it is like barley (porridge to be eaten) with bread slices or spoons. It is good, just do not let it cook too soft.***\n\nFor all the detail and complexity of the instructions, it is a fairly basic recipe: dried noodles with strong spices. You boil them in broth to give it body and flavour, and optionally add parsley roots (which I highly recommend). A third preparation is slightly more complex:\n\n***Differently***\n\n***Let it just swell up a little together, not completely, then leave it so or cut it like (the size of) lentils or a little bigger, depending on how thick they are so that they stay nice and round, and throw them into hot fat so that they brown quickly. Lift them out again with a slotted spoon into the aforementioned broth and let it boil again. If you wish, season it more, the broth becomes opaque and thick from it, if you please. Cut parsley or spinach into it, very finely. It is good, though nobody can judge with certainty, and it gives a sick man the desire to walk.***\n\nHere, the noodles are first parboiled, then quickly fried in fat and returned to the broth which is enriched with leafy greens. I could see the attraction, especially if you added a good deal of spinach and maybe grated some cherese on top.\n\nWe know from the context that these are meant for sick people, but I do not think they were ever reserved exclusively for medicinal purposes. They are too attractive for that. A box of them in the house would be a luxurious treat, a quick, but flavourful and rich dish for any day you aren\u2019t quite up to a full meal or a little under the weather, and need reminding that you had cash to spare. Even in the late sixteenth century, that much spice was not cheap.\n\nAnna Wecker\u2019s Koestlich New Kochbuch is almost certainly not the first cookbook authored by a woman, but it is the first one for which we are certain of the fact. She was the widow of a renowned physician who had written many books, possibly with her help, and the name recognition helped her to launch what would become a culinary best seller.

{"title": "Yet Another Almond Cheese (15th c.)", "selftext": "This stands in marked contrast to [the previous recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/06/more-almond-cheese/).

You must pass it through so it stays thick (i.e. through a coarse cloth or sieve). Let it boil, salt it, and add a little wine or vinegar. Pour it on a white cloth and weigh it down so it hardens. Then slice it as you please and (put it) on a platter and add cold milk with sugar. Stick them with almonds, that does no harm. Serve the curd cheese.***\n\nThis is interesting, and I am honestly not sure that this will work, but I haven\u2019t tried it. The method described here is, of course, how you make acid-coagulated cheese. We have a number of descriptions how it was done using vinegar, wine, or the acidic whey of the last batch. As far as I know, though, the process depends on coagulating the proteins in animal milk and thus should not work with almond milk. Here, it is assumed that it does.\n\nAn interesting point is the use of different term: *K\u00e4se* (*ches*) versus *ziger*. Today, the distinction is formal. *K\u00e4se* is made from milk, normally using rennet, while[ *Ziger* or *Zieger*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziger) is made from whey using acid. It\u2019s unlikely this already applied across the German-speaking world in the 15th century, but there seems to be a sense of distinction at work here that may hinge on the use of an acidic coagulant rather than rennet or a bacterial culture.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

It is just almond milk combined with pounded and boiled walnuts and sugar. When the word \u2018nut\u2019 is used without a qualifier, it usually means walnuts which would give this a deep and slightly bitter flavour. They also soften when cooked more than hazelnuts, so they would produce an actual porridgelike consistency. Small portions will go a long way.\n\nI have no idea what, if any, difference the author intends between talentum and libra. A libra is simply the Latin word for a pound (that is where we get lb.) while a [talentum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_(measurement))originally referred to a much larger weight used mainly to measure metals. Clearly that cannot be meant here, and we have parallels of other recipes in this section of the text that use the German word for pound where these have talentum or libra. Possibly there is a distinction between different standard pounds \u2013 most towns had their own \u2013 but more likely, the terms are used interchangeably.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Roll up the sheet and coat it in egg batter, fry it in fat until it is hard, pass a skewer through it, roast it, and drizzle it with egg and with fat. When it foams, it is cooked fully. Then serve it. You can lard it like a venison roast of roe deer. You can warm it by the fire. This is called a pear roast.***\n\nThis recipe is strange, but not very. The Middle High German word fremd covered both the senses of \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cnot from here\u201d, so it is not entirely clear which one is meant, but [recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/02/apple-preserve-and-a-fritter/)for [similar ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/17/kugelpipp/)[dishes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/07/filled-sheets-of-eggs-a-complex-fritter/)are [not uncommon](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/19/two-complicated-fritters-from-the-innsbruck-ms/). This one is treated with rather unnecessary elaboration, though.\n\nBasically, a mixture of roasted pears, raw sour apples, and boiled pork is reduced to a spicy paste, bound with egg, and spread on sheets, probably of dough. It is not clear what these are \u2013 the word used is ambiguous and can refer to all kinds of flat things, from the leaves of plants to sheets of paper. Here, it most likely means a pancake, though it could possibly be simply fried egg or, for that matter, just pasta dough. Its existence is taken for granted as the recipe simply launches into instructions what to do with the filling \u2013 a twist that threw off the editor Aichholzer who interprets the word *condiment* as a sauce here. That is highly unlikely. Next, the dough sheet is rolled up, coated in batter, fried, skewered, and roasted until the interior is fully cooked. The coating with an egg wash and the optional addition of lardons did nothing for consistency or flavour, but emphasised the role of this dish as a roast, the centrepiece of a meal.

But if other herbs are used along with or other than sage, you may use a little bit of almonds with it.***\n\nThis is not like the[ ubiquitous](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/21/italian-influence-in-the-innsbruck-ms/) [green ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/09/two-recipes-for-green-tart/)[or ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/06/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-i/)[herb tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/07/herb-tart-with-lots-of-sage/) we find in so many sources. Instead of mixing chopped greens with egg and dairy, here, a sweet custard is coloured using the juice of fresh herbs. There is, in fact, a [very similar recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/08/a-sage-flavoured-green-custard/) earlier in the same manuscript:\n\n***50 If you want to make a sage tart***\n\n***Take 2 bunches of sage and two bunches of parsley greens and pound them together in a mortar. Press the juice out thoroughly. Then take a pound of sugar, well pounded, and put it into a bowl. Take ginger to the value of one kraytzer and pepper to the same value, and a little salt, all pounded small. Further take eight eggs and a quarter (qwerttlich) milk, or a little more. Then take the above juice, mix it all together, coat the pan with butter and make the base as thin as possible. Have a care with the embers, you must often lift the lid and make sure that it doesn\u2019t burn. It takes much effort. It is written that you should not use any base, but only flour strewn over the butter.***\n\nBoth use the juice of herbs, mainly sage, to colour and flavour a custard, with today\u2019s recipe further accentuating the colour by using eggt whites only rather than whole eggs. Both are very sweet, a combination that is unusual to modern diners and recalls, if anything, cough drops. Recipe #50 with its assertive ginger and pepper probably had the more complex flavour, though the freedom to combine herbs given in #243 could be used to get creative. Incidentally, the text in #50 indicates that the recipe was taken from a written source that we cannot identify with certainty. Clearly, this was popular, though I struggle to understand why.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

First take off the stems, then hollow them out, and put in sugar, raisins, and cinnamon sticks filled with sugar put in entire. Put the stems back in place into the holes that you cut out. Set them into a glazed earthen pan with a lid and sprinkle sugar over them. Cover the pan and put coals on top and underneath, and let them roast until they are soft. They should have a little liquid (bryelin), that way it is proper.**\n\nThe recipe is straighforward and more commonly used with apples today. Hollowing out quinces will pose an athletic challenge \u2013 they are very hard and unyielding \u2013 but the flavour profile sounds promising. I am not sure how much flavour a whole stick of cinnamon will actually convey to the fruit, but that will be worth finding out. I expect the cooking time to be considerably longer than for apples, too.

I will continue working on finishing the Philippine Welser collection, though. Here is a recipe for gingerbread:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhb6xhrr2czd1.jpg?width=657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2676d034fd6c7e3cb748c8ce19f3dc2a8b614419\n\n***239 How to bake gingerbread (Lezelten)***\n\n***Item take wheat flour and honey that is quite hot and make a dough. Have the dough kneaded well so you can barely stick in your finger, and then make flat loaves (fladen) half a finger thick. Put them into an oven (read ofen, an oven, for haffen, a pot) and bake (Prats) them afterwards. When they are nicely brown, take them out of the oven (Ofen) again and let them cool so they turn hard. Then have the flat loaves pounded with a clean pestle into small pieces on a nicely clean tablecloth. Then put them into a mortar (stampff) so they are nicely broken up (pfeitt). Then take honey again and let it heat up well so it is quite hot. Pour that in (with the crumbs) and add anise and pepper (each) half a vierdung, cinnamon bark one and a half lott, the same amount of cloves, nutmeg one lott, ginger three or four. But if you would have more of the dough, you must have more spices. You may try the dough and if it seems it is not spiced enough, you can easily remedy that. And do not let the dough be dusted with flour too much nor kneaded to strongly, and shape gingerbread cakes (lezellten) from it. Do not make them too thin. Then put them into the oven and bake (prat) them, and see the oven is not too hot. You must have proper diligence so they do not burn, and take them out when they turn brown.***\n\nWe have several[ surviving recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/gingerbread-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-2/)for *lebkuchen*, the highly spiced sweetened confections that were used widely as ingredients in sauces and other cooking. This one is not the most detailed, but it is interesting because it involves a double baking process. The [Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Culinary-Recipes-from-the-Kuenstlich-und-Fuertrefflichs-Kochbuch.pdf) refers to twice-baked gingerbread [in one recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/25/round-gingerbread-fritters/), and this may be what is meant by that.\n\nThe recipe provides exact quantities for spices: a *vierdung* (quarter of a pound \u2013 about 120 grammes) of anise and pepper, one *lott* (about 15 grammes) of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, and three to four times that amount of ginger. The proportions are reasonably exact, but its usefulness is curtailed by failing to tell us the quantity of flour and honey this is supposed to be mixed with. This, obviously, was something any decent householder would know. What is interesting is that the dough is made not directly from flour, but from already baked, dried, and ground-up cakes mixed with more honey yet. The result was likely intensely sweet and very expensive. As an aside, it is also one of the few recipes in the collection to instruct the reader to *have something done* rather than do it \u2013 surely a more realistic perspective on domestic work for the owner.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Take (reserve) the whites of two eggs and beat the rest together and pour it into the cream. Also beat that well and put a little fat into a pan and let it heat. Move it about in the pan, then take the abovementioned egg white, beat it well, and pour it into the hot fat. Move it about as well so it will for a fine tart base (*****bedalin*****). Then pour the cream and the eggs on the tart base, put embers above and below, and let it bake nicely.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe, but clearly not what we think of as a tart. Using egg or an egg-based swirled around a hot pan batter to coat the sides is a trick we encounter a few times in German recipe collections, so it\u2019s not unique or strange. But in combination with a filling of just cream and more egg, it sounded like a dish that would stand and fall with technique. I resolved to give it a try and see what would happen.\n\nIn the absence of a proper tart pan, I used a cast-iron pan. I used four eggs rather than six because the pan was not that big. This is an indicator of the tart pan Philippine Welser has in mind, by the way: It holds six eggs, so it is not very large. The whites of two eggs made the shell, the remainder of the eggs plus about a cup of whipping cream the filling. The instruction to beat the egg whites well is open to interpretation, but I went for a conservative reading and did not beat them stiff. If that was the intent, I wonder how it would hold up to cooking. The still liquid whites went into the pan once it was hot and buttered and immediately solidified along the bottom and sides and started throwing bubbles. After deflating the largest ones, I added the filling and transferred the whole to a 180\u00b0C oven to cook though.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1uvydn9daid1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=109dcd38dd7b8c104036e1ac7965a0766e192d01\n\nThe result was pleasant to eat, but supremely bland. I added some sugar on general principle, though it would really work equally well as a savoury dish. It also did not look like my idea of a tart at all, much more like an omelet or a souffl\u00e9 someone accidentally sat on. I think next time I will try it with stiff egg whites to see if it makes a difference to the consistency. If I wanted to adapt this to modern tastes, I would definitely add some kind of flavouring \u2013 maybe vanilla and sugar, honey, or herbs and garlic \u2013 but it really doesn\u2019t seem worth the trouble.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Then stir in flour so it becomes a thin batter. Take your moulds and first dip them in hot fat. Then pour the batter over them or dip the moulds into the batter so that it does not go higher than they are. Dip it into the fat carefully and let it fry.***\n\n*Rosenk\u00fcchlein* or *Rosetten* are popular in South German traditional cooking, though these days the sets for making them show up more on flea markets than in actual use. The principle is simple, if a little fiddly: You heat a metal form in oil or fat, then dip it in a batter and return it, coated in batter, to the hot fat. As the batter solidifies, it detaches from the metal and becomes a crisp, hollow fritter that can be served with cream or sauce. It takes skill and timing not to let them burn or break, but you can easily turn a session of cooking them into a social occasion much like fondue.\n\nModern rosette fritters are typically flower-shaped. We don\u2019t know what they looked like in the sixteenth century, but flowers are a possibility. Later sources locate them especially in Southwestern Germany, France, and Switzerland, but similar dishes are popular in Scandinavia and much of Western Asia. There is no reason to think they were first invented in Germany or that this is their origin point. However, this may well be the earliest evidence for the tradition in this part of the world. The Swiss [Patrimoine Culinaire website ](https://www.patrimoineculinaire.ch/Produkte?text=rosenk%C3%BCchli&canton=&categorie=5#153)dates the earliest recipe to 1742.

{"title": "Elderflower Orzo (c. 1450)", "selftext": "It's not exactly what you expect when you hear medieval food.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/20/elderflower-pasta-from-the-innsbruck-ms/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/20/elderflower-pasta-from-the-innsbruck-ms/)\n\n Another very seasonal recipe from the Innsbruck MS that I just missed  being able to replicate because a colleague fell ill and I had to cover:   \n\n ***128 If you would make a chopped elderflower porridge,  boil the elderflowers in good milk and pass it through so that the milk  takes on the scent. Take two eggs or 3 and good flour, beat the eggs  into it and chop it very well and prepare the porridge from that etc.***\n\nThere are a lot of [recipes for flavouring](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/21/elderflower-porridge-from-cgm-384-ii/) [milk with elderflowers](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/09/elderflower-porridge-from-meister-eberhard/),  usually by boiling them in it, sometimes just by steeping them. I can  attest to the fact that this works very well, though milk obviously has a  tendency to burn if treated carelessly. The milk could them be used to  make porridge dishes (or, presumably, other things). Interestingly, here  it is used to cook what we would consider pasta. \n\nThe idea of pasta \u2013 a firm dough, usually made with eggs, that is  boiled \u2013 is also not unknown in the medieval German corpus. The  tradition may or may not have come from Italy, but that question is a  bit pointless. Unlike the [*loseyns* ](http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/loseyns.htm)of the English corpus, German noodle dishes do not have imported names. They are typically described as a *Mus*. The Innsbruck MS itself includes  such a one, an early record of [\u2018shaggy *Mus*\u2018](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/23/shaggy-mus-milk-pasta/). \n\nSuch pasta dishes come in a variety of forms \u2013 shaped by hand or  rolled out and cut, with noodles long and thin, broad and flat, or  chopped into small fragments like *orzo*. One[ recipe from the kuchenmaistrey](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/19/elderflower-and-elderberry-mus-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)  that is also flavoured with elderflowers uses thin, long noodles  intended to be worm-shaped. The technique of chopping the pasta small as  is done here also occurs in the [mid-fifteenth century Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/27/milk-pasta-from-cod-pal-germ-551/). \n\nThere is nothing new about this specific recipe then. I still wanted  to single it out for a brief look because I think it encapsulates  encouragement to be creative when engaging with the corpus. If there is  more than one plausible technique to get something done, it is likely  all were familiar. If two recipes or approaches appear compatible,  someone very likely would have combined them. And if you look long and  hard enough, it is very likely you will find evidence of this in a  recipe source somewhere. It seems that if there was one thing we will  not find in the medieval German tradition, it is the idea that a given  dish must be prepared in one specific way. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

Put hot fat into a mortar and let the mortar stand in the  embers. Stick them (the dough pieces) on a skewer and place that in the  mortar and stir it about. Let it fry this way and turn it (the skewer)  over. That is good etc***.\n\nIt may seem hard for us to fathom that [something deep-fried](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/29/battering-and-frying-everything-de-rontzier/)  on a stick was once considered the height of sophistication, but here  we are. At first sight, this is as recipe for fried dough. The point, as  far as I can see, is that the fritters are attached to wooden skewers  and immersed deeply in hot fat that is heated in a moirtar rather than a  pan. This would produce a deeper immersion and allow for a  three-dimensional shape that pan frying does not. That may explain the  attraction of the recipe. \n\nThe *charbel* that is fried here is a bit of a mystery. It is  hard to see where chervil comes in, but on the other hand equally hard  to see what else the word could refer to. The dough used is firm \u2013 *hasen orlein*  are fritters of rolled-out dough, and the term occurs in references to  other fritters shaped this way. Clearly, it is not a case of dipping  herbs in batter and frying them, as was done in other cases. It is  possible that the reference is to the shape, with the  dough  mimicking  either the leaves or the seed pods of chervil. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

The English privateer surgeon Lionel Wafer published his recollections  of the Panama raid in the 1695 New Voyage and Description of the Isthmus  of America. Wafer  was a keen obvserver and naturalist, and he spent  considerable time among Native American communities ashore, most likely  Cuni (he refers to them as \u201cIndians\u201d without distinction). He describes  their mode of cooking thus:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40p42k2mhg3b1.jpg?width=1085&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ae57c852f9dc1095c713240c996929a4bf89d43\n\n***If they take any parcel of their dried flesh, or any  newly killed, they cut it into small pieces and throw them into the  pipkin: putting into it some of the roots and green plantains or  bonanos, or any other eatable, and a great deal of pepper; stewing all  together by a simmering gentle heat, never boiling it. The vessel stands  thus close cover\u2019d for seven or eight hours, till it is set on very  early in the morning, and they stay till all be brought to pulp or mash.  This is for set meals: for plantains or bonanos they eat all day, but  this set meal they eat but once, about midday only. The mash they pour  out into a large earthen dish or calabash, setting it on the great block  which is in every house as a table, sitting round on little blocks as  on stools***.\n\nEarlier in his book, Wafer writes that the Native Americans do not  use culinary herbs or spices other than \u201cpepper\u201d (which in this context  means chili) in their cooking, and that they do not trade for or  frequently use salt. That gives us a handle for reconstructing at least  in the most basic terms what this dish would have tasted like. \n\nIt should be said here that though this may have roots going back  many centureies, this dish is certainly not ancestral cuisine.  Plantains, a primary staple of Caribbean societies in the seventeenth  century, are a Eurasian import brought over by Spanish colonisers.  Still, this is not how Europeans or Africans normally used them. The  combination of meat \u2013 rare and coveted in Cuni cooking \u2013 with a strong  chili flavour and the rich nourishment of cooked plantains makes for a  heavy mash full of umami and deep capsacain hotness that must have had  its attractions. To a European, the absence of salt and spices or herbs  would have seemed strange, though. \n\nIn broader terms, this story suggests that the three great population  groups of the seventeenth-century Caribbean \u2013  Native Americans,  Europeans, and enslaved Africans \u2013 could come together over the stewpot.  West African cooking traditions were rich in stews of meat, vegetables,  and spices, and Europe, of course, was home to the myriad varieties of  pottage, from the humble pea soup to the  fashionable olla potrida.  Here, cross-fertilisation between their traditions would have been  easiest, and the frequent reports by European travellers that local  colonists routinely eat unbearably spicy stews suggests that it happened  early. \u201cPepperpot\u201d turns up as a West Indian staple in cookery books  later, but its roots surely go back this far.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/13xqi3o/lionel_wafer_on_native_american_cooking_1695/", "created_utc": 1685646884.0, "score": 15, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/13xqi3o/lionel_wafer_on_native_american_cooking_1695/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Interesting!"]}

But I found this  in the Innsbruck MS and it ties right back into another rabbit hole I  fell down a while ago: \n\n \n\n[ Hunting Scene from the livre de la chasse of Gaston III of Foix courtesy of wikimedia commons ](https://preview.redd.it/m8sg4znofhwa1.jpg?width=563&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc0757d5b94996cf39ed4b53020a7983ec0003c8)\n\n***42 If you would make a good dish, take the antler of a  young deer and singe it clean. Boil it and pound it. Take the antler and  wine and honey and gingerbread (*****lezelten*****) and boil it together. There shall only be the blood of the antler (used in the dish), and this is good.***\n\nI looked at similar recipes for [cooking antler at the velvet stage in an earlier post](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/27/antler-recipes-from-the-inntalkochbuch/),  and this one really does not add anything. If anything, it is much  simpler. Unlike the one from the Inntalkochbuch, the Innsbruck MS  reduces the entire antler to mush whereas there, stripos of cartilage  remain whole. Otherwise, they are clearly related: \n\n***<<37>>*** **Von einem hirschen geh\u00f6rn**\n\n***For a deer\u2019s antlers***\n\n***At the time it is fuzzy and soft, take it and clean it  thoroughly and singe it over a fire, then cut the upper part into  slices, as many as you can get out of it.

Then take the honey, wine, gingerbread, and the blood from the  antler and pass it through a clean cloth. Boil the antler in this.***\n\nFor more on the practicalities and symbolism of eating antler, see my  earlier post. It is interesting how widespread this practice seems to  have been. We find it from K\u00f6nigsberg all the way to the Austrian Alps. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

This one is interesting because of how widespread it is: \n\n ***15 If you would make a puree of dried pears (*****klotzenpirn*****),  wash them in warm water, cut off the stalks and the cores, and boil  them or let them soften in water. Pound them and pass them through, and  add toasted bread and wine and honey. Season it well and salt it lightly  etc.***\n\nDried pears appear very frequently in the German corpus of recipes. Thes seem to have been a kind of stable, with many [inventive ways of preparing them recorded](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/02/dried-pear-recipes-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/). However, the puree is the most common preparation we encounter, and it has already made this blog twice. Once from [Heidelberg Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/03/dried-pear-puree-from-cod-pal-germ-551/):\n\n***62 Of dried pears (*****Hutzeln*****)***\n\n***If you would make a side dish of dried pears, wash the  dried pears and boil them nicely, pound them small and pass them through  (a cloth) with a little wine. Then boil them well and add good honey,  enough cloves, and if it turns out too thin, grate bread into it. Put it  into a pot and it stays good for you for five or six weeks.***\n\nAnother from the [K\u00f6nigsberg MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/27/pear-puree-from-the-konigsberg-ms/), which is clearly related to the previous:\n\n***\\[\\[18\\]\\]*** **Wilthu ein grune\ufb02 von Huzellen machenn*****:***\n\n***If you want to make a green (dish) of dried pears***\n\n***Wash the pears nicely and pound them finely.

It can be served cold or hot.  Sprinkle it with sugar and cinnamon.***\n\nCompared to this degree of similarity, the Innsbruck MS is obviously  out of the direct transmission chain, but this is clearly still the same  recipe. The parallels also suggest that this puree is meant to have  good keeping qualities, though given how well dried pears last if stored  properly, it is rather hard to see why that would have mattered.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

{"title": "Sausages in a Salad (1559)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/17/sausages-for-salad/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/17/sausages-for-salad/)\n\n A quick recipe today, because I am feeling tired and can\u2019t manage the  more extensive post I had  been hoping for. From the Kuenstlichs und  Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch:  \n\n \n\n[Meat and poultry, Pieter Aertsen 1551](https://preview.redd.it/2p3k7frt1oca1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43e9e963eb367fa555e301fbc886faf8095a2065)\n\n***57 To make Italian (*****Welsche*****) sausages***\n\n***Take many pounds of meat with no skin on it and nothing  else either (except muscle meat). Take bacon, remove the skin and cube  it. Chop the meat, and when it has been chopped well, take the bacon  pieces (*****speckgrieben*****) and add them. Take salt with it and peppercorns and mix them in. Put them into large intestines (*****grosse derm*****) the way you make sausages, and hang them in the smoke so they become dry (*****welck*****). Boil them to serve with a salad.***\n\nThis recipe is interesting. It describes what may well be an ancestor of modern [*Mettwurst*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mettwurst),  a  smoked sausage of heavily salted muscle meat and fat that resembles a  salami. The reference to boiling in a salad suggests a relation with  the kind of sausages like Mettenden and Pinkel boiled with kale (*Gr\u00fcnkohl*)  or sauerkraut today. It is also interesting because we encounter almost  the exact same instructions in the late sixteenth century Low German  print *Dat klene Kakeboeck* (recipe #23): \n\n***Italian (*****Welsche*****) sausages***\n\n***Take several pounds of meat that contains neither skin  nor bones. Also take bacon, cut it into cubes, chop the meat, then mix  the bacon cubes into it and take salt and peppercorns and also mix that  in. Contain it in gut casings and hang these sausages in the chimney so  that they become dry. Boil them with a salad.***\n\nThis is very likely a direct translation. Much of the early cookbook  literature in Low German was taken from High German publications. As to  the origin of the recipe, it is interesting that the [manuscript recipe collection](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/fb05/germanistik/absprache/sprachverwendung/gloning/tx/sawe.htm) of [Sabina Welser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabina_Welserin) contains more detailed instructions to make sausages for salad (recipe #23), though it does not call them \u2018Italian\u2019:\n\n***If you wish to make good sausages to use in salad***\n\n***Take ten pounds of pork, five pounds of oxmeat, always  two parts pork to one part beef, that makes 15 pounds. To that, take 16  lot of salt and five of pepper, which should be pounded a bit, but not  completely. When the meat is chopped, you first add two pounds of fat  bacon diced small. You may take more or less, depending on how fat the  pork is. Take your bacon from the back and not the belly. And they (the  sausages) must be pressed together well, and the more you dry them, the  better. Hang them up in the living room or kitchen, but not in the smoke  (chimney), and not too close to the oven so the bacon does not melt.  This should be done in the waxing moon, and if the chopped meat is dried  well and hard, the sausages will stay good for a long time. And each  sausage must be tied above and below, and the bands must be left on to  hang them up with. They must be turned over every day, the bottom end  up, and when they are dried out completely, you wrap them in cloth and  store them in a box.***\n\nClearly there is a tradition here.  \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.  Despite its brevity, it is interesting especially as it contains many  recipes for *k\u00fcchlein*, baked or deep-fried confections, that  apparently played a significant role in displaying status.

A slice of bread  topped with a cheese and egg mix and dipped in batter below, fried to  crispness. I can see it as a successful lunch dish today, though it  would more plausibly have served for a nightcap or drinking snack at the  time. The cheese fritters referred to in the description of the cheese  batter are a [varied ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/30/fritters-maybe-in-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/)and [popular ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/29/krumme-krapfen-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)[class](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/31/bent-fritters-from-cgm-384-ii/).  Here, the batter that would usually be made stiff and mouldable with  flour is left fairly liquid and spreadable. The bottom batter very  likely was just a simple egg and flour mix with some wine or milk added.  [Strauben ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/09/strauben-fritters-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)were  a kind of leavened fritter made from elastic batter that was pulled  into strings to drop into hot fat, but the term served to cover a great  deal of variety. In this case the likely consistency is relatively thin.  Frying the slices on only one side and spooning hot fat over the top to  brown it will make the cheese topping look much more attractive.  Needless to say, this is a very rich dish suitable for winter days. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

These two recipes belong in that tradition, but they are interesting in  their own right. In #35, instead of fresh fruit, raisins are first  soaked in wine to make them swell up and then battered and fried. The  word *Zyweben*, modern *Zibeben*, is our third term for raisins in this source, after *rosine* and *weinbeere*. In modern times, *Zibeben* are particularly large and soft raisins. The *Regelpiern* in  #36 are hard and tart cooking pears. What makes them remarkable is that  they are cut into the shape of small fish before being fried. Of course  playing with your food is an ancient and venerable tradition, but this  takes us remarkably close to the [origin myth for French fries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries#Origin). The *repuntzeln* mentioned in #35 for comparison are probably the roots of *campanula rapunculus*, the rampion bellflower, though the name was also applied to lamb\u2019s lettuce (*valerianella locusta*).

Roast squirrels and disjoint them. Take onions and fry them in fat, lay the squirrels in with them and let them boil a little in it.***\n\nOur forebears in Europe were quite ready to eat squirrels, though they mainly hunted them for their fur. This recipe looks very workaday and quotidian, though it is not entirely clear whether it describes one mode of preparation or several discrete ones. I think we are looking at a complex preparation in which the squirrel is first parboiled with spices and bacon, then roasted, disjointed, heated in an onion sauce and served that way. This is close to how rabbits are prepared in the [Tractatus de preparandi \u2026 omnia cibaria](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Omnia-Cibaria.pdf), and [I have found that recipe works very well](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/11/onion-sauce-for-lords-and-commoners/). It makes sense for other small animals.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/04/cooking-squirrels/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/04/cooking-squirrels/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1j3k5zs/squirrel_in_onion_sauce_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741118861.0, "score": 13, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1j3k5zs/squirrel_in_onion_sauce_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "A Healthy Mustard (15th c.)", "selftext": "There is an interesting and rather oddly titled recipe in the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfw35pcbjzfe1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb152a989b64aa01b95b8b1d03989e9edac3742\n\n***96 Of a good portuns kraut (purslane?)***\n\n***You must pound mustard. When that happens, pour boiling water into it and stir it like a batter. Do this for three nights in a row, and always pour off the water in the morning and stir it again with new boiling water. On the third morning, grind it with good beer vinegar. Then take horseradish that is cut small and parsley that has been pounded with the root and forced through a sieve. Italian raisins, blanched almond kernels and liquid honey (h\u00f6nig sam), put all of these on the kraut, to each layer (lecht). You should rightly pay its weight in silver for this, that is how healthy it is. It is healthy to eat in the heat of August.***\n\nThe title *portuns kraut* would suggest a dish of greens made with purslane, but that is clearly not what is described here. We are looking at a mustard sauce, and that is indeed what a more puzzling (and probably corrupted) parallel recipe in the Meister Hans manuscript calls it:\n\n***#145 Mustard make thus***\n\n***Item, take and pound (stampff) the mustard. When that is done, pour boiling water on it and stir it as though for a dough/batter. Do that three days in a row, and pour off the water in the morning, and stir it again with boiling water. On the third morning, grind (reib) it with beer (and?) vinegar (the text supports both reading beer and vinegar or alegar, depending on how seriously you take the scribe\u2019s punctuation). Take horseradish (read kren for grains, keren) that are cut small and ground parsley together with the spices (or root? w\u00fcrcz) and boiled cooking pears and ground coriander, sifted through a sieve, Italian raisins, blanched almonds, and liquid honey (hoenig samen \u2013 read hoenig seim). Place that upon the kraut, and do this with every layer. This is rightly paid for in silver, that is how healthy it is. Also always add cinnamon to the mustard.***\n\nIn each one, we have a few issues that the respective other recipe helps us solve. First off, there is no purslane involved. The comma between beer and vinegar in the Meister Hans recipe seems to be superfluous, it means beer vinegar. The enigmating grains (*keren*) found there are horseradish (*kren*) and the ambiguous *w\u00fcrcz*, potentially spices, is a reference to the root of the parsley. The *samen* of honey is of course not seed, but *seim*, first quality liquid honey. Conversely, the instruction to layer this in a pot is unclear in the Dorotheenkloster MS, but clear in Meister Hans. Finally, the step of passing the parsley through a sieve \u2013 presumably cooked, but that is not a given \u2013 makes it clear we are looking at a fairly liquid consistency overall. That leaves the rather odd final sentence in the Dorotheenkloster MS. I assume it belongs to the original, now lost purslane recipe. Composite mustard sauces like this were usually considered winter fare, and the ingredients \u2013 parsley root, cooking pears, and horseradish \u2013 are not really seasonal in summer.\n\nIt is possible to read this as a compost, but it makes more sense as a chutney-like sauce to me. The primary ingredient is mustard made with alegar. This has horseradish added to give it extra bite. Finely mashed parsley leaves and roots give it colour and body, and the sharpness is cut with honey, raisins, almonds, and pears for the fashionable sweet-sharp mixture so popular in medieval sauces. I can imagine this rather attractive after some aging and will probably try it this year.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Chicken and Veal Mus (15th c.)", "selftext": "Among the many dishes in the class of Mus in the Dorotheenkloster MS, there are two very meaty ones:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8bg04cmctde1.jpg?width=366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba99da750e696c0404dcff701a06af85759769b7\n\n***61 Another kind of gm\u00fcs that is black***\n\n***Take a calf\u2019s blood.

Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThese recipes may not invite recreation, but they are an important reminder that no matter how familiar may dishes in the Mus or Gem\u00fcs category seem to us, this was not a class of porridges, breakfasts, or sweet dishes. They were part of the dining table and heavily spiced, rich meat preparations belonged to the class just as much as ephemeral jellies and light porridges. If we would rather not cook chicken or veal in almond milk (though we happily do it in cream to produce [*Frikassee*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frikassee)) or eat our black pudding with a spoon, these are our sensibilities, not those of the time.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Testing the Sloe Mustard (late 16th century)", "selftext": "To make up for my longer absence over the weekend, here is a second post. Last autumn, I [collected sloes to try out a few recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/24/experimenting-with-sloes/). One of them was for a mustard [from the Oeconomia ruralis et domestica](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/12/sloe-mustard-against-scurvy/):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6hhmj30itce1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b5c29e0415ff9140426c6f7f67f6c988696e290\n\n***However, there are many species and types of plums and there are cerasa, cherries, that you would also like to count among the plums propter similitudinem (on account of their similarity), there are pruna sylvestria, sloes, Virgilius calls the bushes on which they grow spinos. Schleedorn (spiny sloes) are a good thing if you use them properly because you make sloe wine from them.***\n\n***In many places, they also preserve them around Michaelmas after the frost has struck them and they have turned soft. You take mustard and grind it with vinegar, and when it has been ground very fine, you put the ground mustard into a new pot and add the sloes whole. Let it stand thus for fourteen days, and then when you eat dried meat, fried pickled herring, ham, or other things from which you usually get scurvy, eat it along with them from a small condiment bowl (Commentichen). This helps, next God, that scurvy will leave you alone and it is good to eat.***\n\nLast weekend, I met with friends from my medieval club and we opened one of the jars to try what it had done. As an initial experiment, this was just a basic combination of sloes, mustard powder, and white wine vinegar with a pinch of salt. After a few mnonths in thje jar, it turned purplish and more liquid, but neither fermented nor went mouldy. I expected the result to be sharp and sour, but it was surprisingly mellow and pleasantly fruity. It still stung on the tongue and was best used in small quantities, but this is a recipe with surprising depth and possibilities. I will try to find the time to develop it some more the coming year, both in terms of the base \u2013 different vinegars, dark or light mustard \u2013 and maybe spices. None of this is mentioned, but all of it could well go unsaid as a matter of course, or left open to the reader.\n\nThe alleged antiscorbutic properties may actually be real. Scurvy is an effect of vitamin-C deficiency, and sloes contain vitamin C. This is destroyed very effectively by cooking, but much less by pickling. The vitamin-C content in the finished mustard may be significant enough to make a difference at a time of the year when fresh fruit and vegetables were rare.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/13/testing-the-sloe-mustard/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/13/testing-the-sloe-mustard/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1i0n4zl/testing_the_sloe_mustard_late_16th_century/", "created_utc": 1736798633.0, "score": 13, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1i0n4zl/testing_the_sloe_mustard_late_16th_century/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Faux Roast of Fish (15th c.)", "selftext": "My apologies for the long silence. Work is busy, and I spent the weekend with my lady, which I too rarely can. Today, after too long a hiatus, I finally begin the next translation: The Dorotheenkloster MS. This recipe collection dates to the fifteenth of late fourteenth century, in part almost certainly before 1414, and comes from Vienna. At first glance, there are a lot of parallels with several other collections which is intriguing, but at this point not unexpected.\n\n[The Dorotheenkloster church as of 1724 - entirely different from what it would have looked like in 1414, but indicative of the community's great wealth](https://preview.redd.it/gpoz7pey0w4e1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70feff74945031174312537b4fa182c08ca845ac)\n\n***1 Of many kinds of roasts, and first, of pike roast***\n\n***Take a pike and cut it open, and remove its bones. You must keep the blood of the pike, that makes it black. If you do not have enough, take gingerbread ships (*****letzelten schifflen*****) and burn them so they turn black. Let them cool, pound them small, and pass them through a sieve. Then take wine and lay the gingerbread in it, and chop it small together with the fish. Add of it in measure. Take rye bread, grate it small, and mix it with the fish and the gingerbread. Season it well, but do not add saffron. Take the greater part of the fish and make (repeated: of the fish and make) a roast of it. Stick the roast on a spit and take pea broth, put that into a cauldron and lay the roast in it. Let it boil until it is done, but be careful it does not overboil. Make two or three of these so they fit a serving bowl. Take almonds and cut them lengthwise, and lard the roast with them. Also stick in whole cloves so it becomes scented (*****gesmach*****). You must now have raisins and grind them small with Italian wine and pass them through with sugar and other good spices. You must have that (sauce) with it, and serve it.***\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward Lenten dish: Chopped fish is shaped into a piece to resemble roast meat, coloured dark with its own blood or toasted gingerbread and given body with grated bread. The final product is stuck with cloves even includes faux larding with pike flesh for colour contrast, showing white on the dark \u2018roast\u2019. The whole is served with a sweet-spicy raisin sauce.\n\nReading a recipe like this, it is important to recall how outrageously extravagant it is. Fresh fish was a luxury most people in cities never tasted, pike among the more expensive kind, and raisins and Italian wine added to the considerable bill before we even begin to consider the cost of spices and sugar. It is not out of place in a wealthy community of Augustinians, as the Dorotheenkloster was, but certainly not representative of medieval fare.\n\nAn interesting point is the recurrence of \u2018ships\u2019 of gingerbread. These [also show up](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/29/geislitz-a-raisin-dish/) in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) and clearly they refer to some specific kind of gingerbread. I just have no idea what distinguished them from the regular type.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

When it is washed and picked, put it into a vessel or on a board and lean it towards the fire. When it is well dried, you must pound it well in a mortar and strain it through a sieve or cloth so it becomes like (as fine as) flour. Secondly take (struck out: the meat of the breast of a capon) the breast cut out of a capon and put it into a pot or cauldron. Set it by the fire and let it boil until it is cooked, but not too much. Then take out the breast and let it cool. Then pull it apart like silk and then wrap it in a napkin (*****saruet*****) so it does not become hard or pointy. Third, take a handful of the rice flour, put it into a clean tinned vessel, be that a tinned bowl (*****peckh*****) or pan, and pour on good cream. Stir the flour nicely so that it turns very thin and set it over a coal fire in a tinned cooking vessel. Always keep stirring it so it doesn\u2019t burn or turn lumpy. This way, it quickly becomes thick and you must add a little more cream and stir it again. And when it boils up again, you throw in the torn-up breast and pour on a little rosewater. When it is about to become thick again, take fine, pounded sugar and also add it so it becomes nicely sweet. It must also be salted and fresh butter added, as much as a hen\u2019s egg. Then take it off the fire and serve it. The mues must be quite thick when you put in the sugar because when the sugar is added, it immediately becomes thin. It must also not boil for long after the sugar is added because it will turn black after that point. But if you want to make it with fish, take a pike and let it boil like you usually boil one, except you must not add any vinegar. Then take out the pike and remove the bones from it or pick them out. Chop the pike and treat it as is described for the chicken breast. Or (you can) also pick a stockfish apart in this way and boil it, and when it is well boiled, take it out and pick it apart into the mues when it is made, as it is described with the other (ingredients). And when you serve it with fish, set neat piles all around them in the bowl with a spoon.***\n\nThis recipe ends the collection, and it is decidedly odd. Not only is it almost[ identical to an earlier one (#237)](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/29/a-detailed-blancmanger-recipe/), it begins with a first paragraph that breaks off midsentence and then starts again, like some podcasts when you try to skip an ad break. This is not likely to be an oversight \u2013 corrections are made in the text elsewhere in the manuscript, and anyway, the text contains no error. Nor is this a case of someone returning to his notes and absentmindedly rewriting the same thing. This book was written by a scribe. Paper and column inches cost money. It is hard to say what happened here, but it must have been something significant at the time.\n\nAnother thing it does is add to our already broad collection of German names for blanc manger. After [*blamenser/blamensir* and *pulverisei*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/21/blancmanger-by-any-other-name/), we had Philippine Welser\u2019s collection refer to it[ as sugar *mus*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/11/blancmanger-by-yet-another-name/) and [plamauschy](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/29/a-detailed-blancmanger-recipe/). The slightly less garbled *blamanschy* we find in the title of the recipe is clearly derived from the French name of the dish, but interestingly, the second beginning calls it *manschy plamby*, a far-fetched derivation of its Italian name we find more faithfully reproduced [by Rumpolt as *Manscho Blancko*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/08/turkey-recipes-from-rumpolt/). Consistency in naming continues to underwhelm.\n\nIn terms of content, there is little new here except the information that a fish blanc manger would be served as an accompaniment to cooked fish, arranged artfully in the serving bowl. It must have been reasonably thick to allow this, and modern cooks might well consider piping it.\n\nThus ends my work on Philippine Welser\u2019s recipe book, a fascinating resource.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones.

Cut about eight slices from each  apples, depending on how large they are, and turn them in flour. Fry  them, but not as thoroughly as other apple slices. Then lay them out on a  tart base and put on another (layer) until the tart base is full. Then  take raisins, cinnamon and sugar and strew that on it. Then lay on  another layer of apples and strew it again as before. Then put on a thin  cover (deckalin) and cut it as you wish.

Then lay them  out on the tart base close together twice (two layers?). After that,  take sugar, cinnamon, and a little ginger and sprinkle it all over. Also  take raisins. Prepare a cut cover to go on top, brush it with egg, and  bake it gently in a tart pan.***\n\n***26 If you want to make a tart of pureed apples***\n\n***Take good apples and steam (******depf******)  them until you can pass them through a cloth. Then put them into a bowl  and add cinnamon, ginger, and sugar, pour it out on a tart base and  bake it nicely. When it firms up well and is about half baked, take  rosewater and brush it all over. You can also do this with pears or  quinces, or add quinces to this. Also adding a little grated bread is  good.

The focus this time was another staple, cassava. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pty2e113u2wa1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d02ae09ed53424a815ff3b4629d72046caf638e9\n\nCassava is a starchy root that was usually processed into flour and  baked into flat cakes. Pressing out its juice and toasting the dry  grated flesh was necessary to mitigate its toxicity, though even at the  time, it was understood some \u201csweet\u201d cassava was safe to eat without  this. Today, the cassava roots we can buy in our supermarkets are such  sweet cassava. \n\nThe first thing I tried out was making my own cassava bread. This is  an ethnographic staple, and it is easy to see why. European writers came  from bread cultures and when they studied other cultures, they looked  for their equivalent of bread. This looks and feels so much like bread  that it clearly stood out to them, and Europeans themselves seem to have  eaten a lot of it. Almost all travel accounts describe its manufacture:  Grated cassava root is mashed into a dough and spread on hot stones or  metal pans to cook. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4f4ty26u2wa1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ac39054f6ac8526e375936ba10cec95a0573fef\n\nGiven I have  never successfully made any cassava  bread, my  experiment here was very basic. I used finely grated, dried cassava \u2013  known by its trade name as gari \u2013 and water to make a succession of  three doughs, one very dry, the second about slightly mushy, the third  close to a thick liquid. After trying to shape all three into patties, I  cooked them in a crepe pan. \n\nThe best result was achieved with the medium-wet dough on a gentle  heat, pressing down to produce an even thickness. I flipped the small  patties, but historically, loaves were typically too large to turn over  and would thus be cooked from the bottom. Lionel Wafer describes them as  resembling oatcakes, brown only on one side, and writes that they were  dried in the sun after cooking.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjqtgbe9u2wa1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4349a23bf5013f5bfe4e1bb87e974551e800cfc8\n\n Eaten fresh, as I did on Sunday, the cassava bread had a distinctive  tart flavour and a  soft centre. I wondered whether I had undercooked  them, but even the ones I left in the pan for much longer than I would  ever cook a pancake stayed soft. The ones I reserved for keeping  overnight turned hard and brittle the next day. I tried them tonight;  They are the consistency of thin kn\u00e4cke and have lost practically all  flavour.  I can see then serving for hardtack and will try to use them  in cooking in the next few weeks, as Labat describes.  \n\n     \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxj8cf8du2wa1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba9a525c1877d59cb59dc43ec9664b1f971b6185\n\nIn addition, I used part of the cassava root I bought to boil in  water. Several accounts describe this as common practice among Native  Americans, though I am sure this was only for sweet cassava. Boiled in  salt water, the pieces turned soft like the firmer kind of potato does.  If left to stew for hours, they would no doubt disintegrate the way  Wafer describes when he talks of the cuisine of the Cuni of Darien. That  will be worth its own experiment come time.\n\nThird, I tried to see what happened if I would roast the cassava  root. Both Wafer and Exquemelin describe this, and we probably  underestimate how common this mode of cooking was in Europe at the time.   Lacking embers of a cooking fire, I wrapped it in aluminium foil and  stuck it in the oven. The result was convincing from a historical  perspective, but easily the least pleasing of the three. Wafer states  that roasted cassava roots would be cooked in pots with meat or fish,  not eaten as they were, and I can easily imagine that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1rugvfqku2wa1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7720bdaf268eb7ef332b5ef30bb9465fd6a9ab9\n\n To  accompany the cassava in the etymological sense, I used the  seasoning Labat described for roasted pork \u2013 lemon juice, allspice,  chili, cloves, and ginger \u2013 with chopped onion as a filloing for  rolled-up slices of pork belly. The combination worked very well, and  next time I have guests over for another of my buccaneer meals, I think I  will try this on a larger scale as  a kind of pancetta.  \n\n \n\nFinally, having a lot of boiled and roasted cassava left over, I  decided to mash it with the fat and juices of the cooked meat to see  what that would do. This was the kind of thing Europeans  did at the  time \u2013 enriching staple porridges with dripping, animal fat, or oil \u2013  and we know  from Exquemelin and Labat it was done with maize porridge.  It worked. Initially, the mix still had the distinctive sour note of  cassava, but this was quickly lost. The puree is quite firm, dry, and  filling, and it supports strong flavours well. \n\nNone of these dishes impressed me the way [guava pie](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/06/buccaneer-cooking-and-fun-news/), orange sauce, plastron or [coconut rice](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/27/further-adventures-in-buccaneer-cookery/) did, but there is the nucleus of several solid recipes here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12ysce6/cassava_bread_and_spicy_pork_belly_17th_century/", "created_utc": 1682448822.0, "score": 12, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12ysce6/cassava_bread_and_spicy_pork_belly_17th_century/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes.

The first was the [Fledlein from the Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/27/fried-cheese-sandwiches/) I posted in December:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gedxm6zl9ca1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b11093b9e00f63ef740e74c4ca391f860b42857a\n\n***34 To Make Good*** **Fledlein**\n\n***Take*** **semel** ***bread and cut it like for golden slices (tostes dor\u00e9es, like French toast), and take grated cheese as though for frying*** **kuechlein**. ***Break eggs into it and do not make it too thin, but thinner than for cheese fritters*** (**ke\u00dfkuechlein**). ***Spread it on one side, one finger thick. Then make a batter as though for baking*** **strewblein** ***(a  type of fritter) and dip it into the batter on the other side that has  not been spread (with cheese). Set it into the fat so that the cheese is  above. Thus it gains a*** **poitlein** ***(crust?)*** ***like a*** **fledlein**. ***Spoon (hot fat) on top assiduously, thus it will be brown like the*** **fladen** ***should be.***\n\nThis sounded quite promising. I started with plain wheat bread,  cutting off the crust as was  commonly done in medieval and Renaissance  recipes, but in retrospect I think it would be  better to not do that.  The best medium would likely be a relatively dense white bread, not as   airy as most Br\u00f6tchen or baguette are. I also learned it is a good idea  to keep the pieces small enough. I used some large ones, a little less  than the size of postcards, and they were hard to manage in the pan.\n\nThe cheese mix used here is just cheddar and egg put together in a  blender, three eggs to 250g of cheese which easily covered about twenty  palm-sized pieces of bread. It is quite sticky, but spoonable and easy  to spread on the bread slices, and it could definitely have used some  extra spices. I was worried the bread would be harder to handle with a  thick coating of cheese, but instead it became easier. And again, I  would say that leaving on the crust would have helped even more, making  it possible to move the pieces into the batter and the pan by hand  rather than resorting to forks and a spatula as I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bs5seyf0m9ca1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=734fa3ad192208824af0987457f52cf024db8dae\n\nThe bottom coating was just egg, flour, and a little water, roughly the  consistency of pasncake batter. After quickly dipping the bottom of the  bread in a  shallow bowl, I moved them to a pan full of hot oil. Since  you should not turn them, spooning  oil over the top of them is  necessary to get them to brown at all. I think I used too little heat  and will try a higher setting yet next  time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83udvp13m9ca1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9ad8211aa96a8902e7cbd26d6de66093cf10053\n\nAltogether, though, the result was very satisfying. I expected them to  soak up fat, but the batter on the bottom seems to have sealed them  pretty well. They only left a few spots on the paper towels I put them  on to drain and did not taste oily at all. They were very rich, though,  as  you would expect. The slightly melted, soft cheese topping  contrasted nicely with the crunchy base and chewy bread. We ate them  with pickles, vegetables, and fruit (including, heretically, pineapple)  and they proved universally popular.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10ctnzu/testing_the_1559_cheese_toast_fritter_recipe/", "created_utc": 1673813749.0, "score": 12, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10ctnzu/testing_the_1559_cheese_toast_fritter_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Um yes please", "Yum!"]}

I have been asked to  do as lecture on the Columbian exchange as part of an SCA teaching event  and this is one of the odder things to be found in our German sources:  \n\n ***There are four kinds of dishes to be prepared from a guinea pig (*****Indianischen Schwein*****)***\n\n***1. Quickly roasted like a suckling pig because it is small.***\n\n***2. Smoked or salted, be they cold or warm, they are good to eat. They are also good in (i.e. cooked with) green cabbage (*****gruenem Koel*****)***\n\n***3. Cooked in sauce, yellow, white, or nicely sour with lemons, in pepper sauce, or with its own blood.***\n\n***4. In pastries, be they warm or cold, or  cooked black in its own blood it is good to prepare in many ways.***\n\n(Marx Rumpolt p. lxi r)\n\nThere is nothing intrinsically surprising about these recipes. By the  1580s, many forms of New World wildlife had become established in  Europe as novelties. The first description of the guiney pig comes from [Conrad Gessner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Gessner)\u2018s [Historia Animalium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_animalium_(Gessner_book)) (1551). [Hieronymus Bock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bock) mentions turkeys kept in parks and eaten by the 1550s, and [Leonhart Fuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhart_Fuchs)  describes chili peppers in the 1560s. Rumpolt himself also has recipes  for turkey which I hope to add soon. As cook to the  elector spiritual  of Mainz and very likely trained in a Habsburg court kitchen, he was in a  good position to be aware of the latest fads. \n\nIt is interesting to note that these recipes are entirely familiar.  This is a common pattern in the early European adoption of American  foodstuffs: They are integrated in pre-existing slots. *Curcubita* squashes are prepared like *lagenaria* gourds, the vast universe of *phaseolus* beans  corraled into the niches of broad bean and black-eyed pea, turkeys  cooked like bustards or other game birds, and the humble guinea pig  treated like a rabbit. Indeed, if you wanted to recreate any of these  recipes, the chapter on rabbits will be your first reference.  European  cooks were happy to use new resources, but not to have their toolkits  and methods altered. This is an interesting difference to other parts of  the world where different cooking m,ethods were more readily adapted,  and goes some way to explaining why some New World crops took a long  time to become accepted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Guinea pig illustration, Flemish, early seventeenth century](https://preview.redd.it/f21up5pxbhaa1.jpg?width=4288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa3ac03572e8b984450df9284e4b2c05309aaef7)\n\n As an aside, the name Rumpolt gives is not commonly used today. The  modern Meerschweinchen is a diminutive of Meerschwein, sea pig, a word  that originally described the harbour porpoise ([phocoena phocoena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_porpoise)) which is still called *Schweinswal* in  German. We eat neither these days. By the sixteenth century,  nomenclature was still in flux and Rumpolt himself uses the word *Meerschwein* to  refer to what, going by the illustration, appears to be a porcupine  (though trusting the illustrations on exotic creatures is not wise in  Rumpolt, and this image is used at least twice). The Flemish illustrator  of our early seventeenth century image calls what is clearly a guinea  pig an Indian rat, *Cuniculus indicus* (Indian rabbit) and *Cochon d\u2019Inde* (Indian pig). Things took  a while to settle.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1053z7e/1581_guinea_pig_recipes/", "created_utc": 1673035520.0, "score": 12, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1053z7e/1581_guinea_pig_recipes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I tried guinea pig in Ecuador 20 years ago.

Place the hens in the pot with ginger roots (*****Imberzehen*****)  and peppercorns, and also a little mace. See that when it boils, it is  to boil gently. When they have boiled a little, about halfway, strain  off the broth and wash the hens with warm water with a cloth that is  small.

Cut it lengthwise, nicely  thin, and lay it in the broth you have drawn off. Take a good quantity  of horseradish and let it boil up two or three times. When you wish to  serve it, lay the horseradish on the chickens, but not too much. Thus  the broth will taste good.***\n\nThis recipe is unremarkable, basically just boiled chickens, but it  nicely illustrates the kind of care and thought that went into even  plain preparations and very likely often goes unmentioned. Chickens  gently simmered in a spicy broth flavoured with ginger, pepper, and  horseradish sounds like an appealing idea. Contemporary recipes from  other sources point out that boiled chickens could be served over  toasted bread sops and garnished with grated cheese, both of which  should work well here.

{"title": "Cheesy Cabbage (15th c.)", "selftext": "I was rather busy yesterday and couldn\u2019t finish my post, so I\u2019ll give you my brief report today. I tried out the recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS I [posted two weeks ago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/31/cabbage-with-meat-and-eggs/):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jr2cs48h8dje1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a26ef659798b7fb10c922bc5e34237371c8cfeb3\n\n***92 Of young white cabbage (*****kraut*****)***\n\n***Take young white cabbage and cut it into wedges. Lay it in the pot and let it boil, then pour off the water. Have ready boiled meat in a different pot, mutton or beef, and lay the meat in with the cabbage. Then take eggs and boil them hard. Peel them and fry them in a pan whole. When the meat and the cabbage are nearly boiled, put in the eggs and hard cheese and let it boil together again. Make it quite fat. But if you do not want to cook it with meat, put on eggs prepared in the pan as described before and the cheese, and serve it.***\n\nI speculated about the form this dish was supposed to take back then, and it made me sufficiently curious to want to try it out. Two shopping trips later, I got started. For meat, I opted for a pound of stewing-grade mutton which was likely still a lot nicer than what medieval people got from sheep primarily kept for milk and wool. The cabbage wasa small head *Spitzkohl*, a type of white cabbage with looser leaves than the typical heads we get today, though I suppose savoy cabbage would also do fine. The eggs were free-range chicken eggs, larger than the ones the original would have used, and the cheese leftover Babybel snack cheese because I needed a way to get rid of it now my son decided he no longer likes it. This is not as far off the mark as one would think; A \u2018hard\u2019 cheese in medieval terms would be one that held together as a loaf, not necessarily something like parmeggiano or Schabziger. We know from later documents that relatively soft, mild and fat cheeses were popular. While this was still a long way from the industrial pellets I used, it would not be a different world. That said, I believe the cheese is the place where this recipe can be most effectively varied and improved.\n\nMy first assumption was that the recipe decribed slow stewing, perhaps in the ubiquitous pottery cookpots stood by the embers or in a thick-walled brass vessel. I oped for a cast-iron pot to replicate the process and first simmered the coarsely chopped cabbage in salt water. Meanwhile, I also cooked the meat, again a slow simmer in salt water, though this likely would be and probably was improved by adding root vegetables and onions. After draining and cursorily squeezing out the cabbage, I returned it to the pot together with the meat and its broth and kept it simmering away for about an hour. At that point,l the meat was very tender, the cabbage soft and almost gelatinous, and the broth had reduced to a small amount of intensely flavourful sauce.\n\nI was unsure what frying hard-boiled eggs in a pan would achieve and found that this is actually difficult to do. They stick, the white tears off on patches, and any browning is uneven. I suspect it was meant to be done with much more fat than I used, and I could see it working very well if the egg were floating in hot oil. I did not care for the taste much, though. Adding the cheese to the hot cabbage was a success. I was uncertain what it would do, and positively surprised that it melted and dissolved, coating the cabbage and imparting its flavour and richness. I decided no further addition of fat was needed, though dependsing on the proportion of vegetable to meat and cheese this might well be called for. I had a very generous 500g of meat (including bone) to 1.2kg of cabbage and about 100g of cheese, and it was very rich.\n\nThe resulting dish was very far from where upper class medieval cuisine usually takes us. There\u2019s no play of colours, no blend of spices, no smooth texture or appealing shape. It was, however, a very satisfying meal for a cold night served with fresh brown bread (made with German Type 1050 wheat flour, broadly similar to fine bread by medieval lights). While not upper-class cuisine, this was in no way a poor meal. Eating like this took resources not everyone had. It may reflect the way rich people ate on a daily basis more accurately than many more commonly found recipes involving luxurious ingredients.\n\nThis first trial can be improved. Above all, the dish can use more seasoning, and there\u2019s every reason to think that would have happened. Whether through vegetables cooked with the meat or seasonings added to the cabbage, this is an easy dish to liven up. I would suggest depth through a bunch of *Suppengr\u00fcn* (carrot, parsley, leek, and celeriac) and some pepper and caraway at the end.\n\nThe flavour of mutton came through surprisingly weakly, and leaving out the meat in exchange for more cheese would not be an issue. Adding a different kind of cheese is likely to do the most good. I don\u2019t think a very mature cheese would do much good \u2013 it would be hard tro melt and the nuances of flavour will be lost \u2013 but something with more character should do fine. The dish certainly can take it.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Let it boil and cut a semel loaf into cubes, fry it in oil, and scatter them on the food. Serve it.***\n\nThis is a fast day dish of three parts: A pancake made with fish roe, cut into pieces, served in a roux sauce made with oil and fish broth, thus also fit for a fast day, and fried croutons (*semel* was the finest grade of bread on regular sale, quite white and light). This is not what we would expect under this heading, but the Dorotheenkloster MS is often good for such surprises.\n\nThe pancake made with fish roe is not very surprising. There are other recipes where it is used more or less in place of eggs, and this is how you would make pancakes. The sauce \u2013 a *pheffer*, i.e. thick and spicy \u2013 is clearly a dark roux. This, too, is not that surprising. We have [other ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/02/honey-sauce-for-fish-from-cgm-384-ii/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/28/fish-furhess-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)for what [looks very much like roux sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/06/kuchenmaistrey-in-print-and-pea-patties/) in medieval sources. The legend that this was invented in seventeenth-century France is simply wrong.\n\nWe can also be quite sure that this recipe was not interpolated later because there is an almost verbatim parallel in the Meister Hans collection:\n\n***#17 A dish of fish roe make masterfully thus***\n\n***Item take fish roe, but not barbel roe, and pound it in a mortar and fry it in a pan (as) a broad sheet, and cut it into cubes. Burn (brown \u2013 prenn ain) flour in a pan with oil so that it turns black and take a broth (pr\u00fce) of fish. Make a pepper sauce with the flour. Take vinegar and spices and have it boil up, and boil it (the cubed roe?) in that. Cut a white wheat loaf (semlein) into cubes and brown the oil (brown it in oil) and pour it over the dish.***\n\nAs to what it would taste like \u2013 probably not as good as it would if it were made with butter and meat broth, but not bad at all. Hot, rich, spicy, with a mix of textures between soft pancake, unctuous sauce, and crunchy bread, it could make a very good dish for a cold day. It isn\u2019t fit for grand presentation, but likely would have served for more private meals while the fish that had provided the roe would be reserved for fancier dining.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Honeyed Pear Puree (15th c.)", "selftext": "Today\u2019s recipe is not very interesting culinary terms, but for technique. From the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***78 A m\u00fcs of pears***\n\n***Take a clean, dry pot and put pears in it. Remove the stems and the flowers (the remnants of the flower at the bottom). The pot must not be greasy. Lay the pears in it and shut the pot well with wooden pieces (verspetl) so the cannot fall out. You must have a pot of water ready that is boiling. Set the pears atop (oben auf) the pot with water that is boiling, that way they cook (praten) in the steam. Take them down when they are soft. Let them cool, pound them small and pass them through a cloth. And you must have honey ready, let that boil until it turns brown. This will give the dish a brown colour. If you want it to be yellow, add saffron. You can serve it hot or cold. When you serve it, sprinkle on (spice) powder on it. You may use ginger, sugar (and?) cloves for that. Also put that on it.***\n\nCombining pears with caramelised honey and spices is bound to be good. This is not an exciting recipe in that sense, and you can do more interesting things with the fruit than mash them. What is interesting is the technique of steaming them: secured with several wooden skewers or just branches across the opening of a pot that is then inverted over another pot with boiling water. This is a method described in more detail by [Walter Ryff in the mid-sixteenth century](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/13/quince-electuary-after-walter-ryff/), but was already known well enough to be casually mentioned over a century earlier.

{"title": "\"Black\" (Pear and Quince) Tart (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/22/a-black-tart/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/22/a-black-tart/)\n\nToday, I can continue the colour tart sequence from Philippine Welser\u2019s recipe collection:\n\n***242 To make a black tart***\n\n***You must take eight, ten, twelve, or up to fourteen good pears according to whether they are large or small and roast them well on the embers so they are darkened (uberprennt). And so you do not roast them too strongly this way and burn them, it is necessary to thrust them into the glowing embers so they turn nicely soft. Similarly you must take good quinces that are entirely like the pears in their appearance ad roast them first over the embers and then in the embers to make them nicely soft. Quinces take much roasting because they are harder than pears. Once both quinces and pears are roasted so that they are fully soft, discard their outer skins and their cores and everything else that does not serve our purpose. Then take a seutel of milk, but it must not be full, barely half full, because the pears and quinces for this (recipe) are juicy in themselves. (Also take) nine eggs with their whites and yolks as they are, and also a seutel of sugar, rather more than less, you must never stint on this. Also diligently pound half a pound of almonds and have a good and proper care that no bad (henndige) one is among them. Pass all of this through a sieve with the milk, then add cinnamon, cloves, pepper, ginger, and equally nutmeg, added according to occasion and need. It is (further) made as described above with a dough so thin it looks like paper, and also a topping made of rosewater, egg whites, and sugar on top, this tart will be good.***\n\nThis is clearly based on the same principle as the [white ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/20/the-other-white-tart/)[tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/13/a-white-tart/), with the primary appeal being colour variation. I cannot envision the result being black unless you burned the pears and quinces quite badly, which you are expressly told not to do. I would expect it to come out a greenish brown, but still a clear contrast to the white of egg whites, almonds, rice, and milk. In terms of flavour, it will probably be closer to what we expect of a [pumpkin pie](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/10/pumpkin-pie-from-the-oeconomia/) than any [pear or quince tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/11/pear-tarts/) we are familiar with. Of course, our pumpkin pie recipes are not a lot like [those of the sixteenth century](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/07/pumpkin-pie-trial/), including one in the same collection ([\\#43](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/01/another-pumpkin-tart/)). However, the technique of combining cooked fruit with eggs, milk, sugar, and spices to make a solid filling was widely applied to other ingredients, as it is here. If you try to reconstruct this, please remember that the pears used at the time would not have been dessert pears, but cooking pears which were both smaller and much harder and drier. Using modern pears will likely result in a soggy mess unless you reduce the proportion of milk.\n\nOne very interesting point here is the instruction to take a seutel of milk, but have it barely half full. This suggests that the *seutel* is indeed a convenient vessel, not a measure of capacity. This, in turn, locates these recipes in a specific place where these drinking vessels were on hand. It is likely that the long recipes towards the end of the book were added later, quite possibly in Tyrol, so it might be worth looking into common drinking vessels there.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gxbzqo/black_pear_and_quince_tart_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1732293371.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gxbzqo/black_pear_and_quince_tart_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Today, I went back there to gather some sloes and try out recipes. I had two in mind.\n\nThe first is an [antiscorbutic mustard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/12/sloe-mustard-against-scurvy/) from the *Oeconomia ruralis et domestica* by Johannes Coler, a North German clergyman who collected enormous amounts of facts for his influential householding book.\n\n***In many places, they also preserve them around Michaelmas after the frost has struck them and they have turned soft. You take mustard and grind it with vinegar, and when it has been ground very fine, you put the ground mustard into a new pot and add the sloes whole. Let it stand thus for fourteen days, and then when you eat dried meat, fried pickled herring, ham, or other things from which you usually get scurvy, eat it along with them from a small condiment bowl (Commentichen). This helps, next God, that scurvy will leave you alone and it is good to eat.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqpuvaodmsqd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f6ea6ad0f0f44943f270a8ee11c04d65e53bbc6\n\nObviously it is not that late in the year yet, but I have a freezer, and the likelihood of frost in October is vanishingly low these days anyway. So I took the sloes, washed them, and popped them into the freezer quickly. The mustard, too, was made in the most basic manner by processing yellow mustardseed with white wine vinegar and a bit of salt. It is intensely sharp and sour, and may actually go well with the fruity acidity of the sloes. I combined the two and look forward to seeing what will happen, but I think I will be storing it in the refrigerator because I am a coward when it comes to wild fermentation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wzjtshgmsqd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0e9f304a29f1667d7d69d73e5333daf8d292098\n\nThe other is a rather cryptic instruction in the[ fifteenth-century manuscript Cgm 384-I](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf). It is listed among recipes for compost, vegetables and fruit stored with acidic sauces.\n\n***9 Sloe Compost***\n\n***Sloe compost: take wine and honey in equal amounts and boil it. Then take sloes, well-prepared, and lay them into this (when it is) cold. You may also stick pears and medlars with spices. Take as much as you wish to serve each time, that way the spices retain their power and goodness.***\n\nThis is interesting, but hard to parse. Does it mean that the sloes must be combined with medlars and pears, or just may be? Preserving fruit stuck with spices is a technique found in other manuscripts, after all, and the sloes could simply be a flavour-bearing accompaniment to the much larger spiced fruit. Clearly, the sloes do not have spices stuck into them, though, and it would be quite impractical given how small they are. Or is this an instruction for preserving sloes, and the author thinks it is like that for medlars and pears? Or possibly simply a merging of two recipes that were originally separate? And what does \u201cwell-prepared\u201d imply? It is hard to say.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ehm5f4jmsqd1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c981b4367e0994f422ff3063e36f120cbf50ab18\n\nI decided to try and find out what the liquid would do to the sloes kept in it. That might answer whether it makes sense to do this with sloes alone at all, or whether the other fruit are necessary.

They were an important source of food and especially of protein in general, of course, and some historians have [credited their large-scale cultivation](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/magazine/best-invention-how-the-bean-saved-civilization.html) with making medieval European civilisation possible. However, they were not popular with the wealthy and powerful. For monks, who were forbidden meat and bound to a humble lifestyle, they were the perfect fit. It is thus hardly surprising to find Ekkehart IV blessing a lot of them.\n\nWe should note that legume (*legumen*) is not a botanical category to Ekkehart, but a culinary one. Millet (#172 and 173) falls into it despite being a grain because, unlike \u2018proper\u2019 grains, it is not milled and baked, but boiled to a mush entire. This form of categorisation is common in historical sources because it makes intuitive sense. Much later, the[ fifteenth-century recipe collection of Meister Eberhard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Meister-Eberhard-translation-revised.pdf) uses the term *kuchenspeisen* for the same class of food.\n\nThere is relatively little we can gather for reconstructing preparation methods here. We learn that beans were served in at least two different forms. The *pulmentum* referred to in #164 could describe any kind of cooked vegetable dish, but here the most likely explanation is mashed beans. That would contrast with beans cooked whole described in the following entry. In both cases these are, of course, fava beans (*Vicia faba*), the only kind then known in Europe. The reference to many peas (numerosas) in #167 also suggests that they were served whole, not mashed, since the blessings were spoken at the table over foods as they were served.\n\nThere is also a reference top chickpeas that may hint at variety. The *species* of chickpeas my simply be introduced for the sake of metre, but other [sources distinguish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/21/legumes-according-to-constantinus-africanus/) between light and dark (usually called white and red or white and black) chickpeas. Unfortunately, we do not learn how they were prepared. Most likely, they were simply cooked.\n\nLentils are introduced with a reference to the Biblical story of Jacob tricking Esau into giving up his birthright (Genesis 25:29-34). The lentils are directly credited with agency in this through a participle \u2013 they are birthright-selling lentils. interestingly, while the most common English translation of the Bible renders the object of desire as a \u2018mess of pottage\u2019, Luther, and all German Bibles following, have kept the specific nature of a Linsengericht. This is still proverbial as a pittance in German. In #171, we even get twqo useful pieces of information, which is owed strictly to the wordplay the writer makes with *lens* \u2013 the lentil \u2013 and *lente* \u2013 slowly. Thus we now know that lentils came in different kinds, and the red ones were cooked slowly, most likely to a poree.\n\nFinally in #174, we come across a slightly problematic term. Variations of *phaselum* show up in a number of sources dating to before 1492, and the exact translation is disputed. Today, *phaseolus* is the name for all New World beans, but those clearly cannot be meant. I tend towards interpreting the word as black-eyed peas (*Vigna unguiculata*). However, other interpretations are possible. People used to eat a number of crops we no longer grow.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057. Theyare a collection of blessings to be spoken over food. Written in short rhyming couplets in Latin, they are unusual in their attention to the diversity of foods and preparations. This is not a serious work of theology or medicine, but an intellectual diversion, playful verse meant to show off a broad vocabulary and facility with Latin. That is what makes them very valuable \u2013 they give us a glimpse of the mental horizon of a senior cleric of the 11th century at the table.\n\nThis entry was posted in [Uncategorised](https://www.culina-vetus.de/category/uncategorised/).

To bake it, you must do as follows: Put it into the tart pan and bake it for a good while until you think it is half baked. Then take it out and pour hot fat over it. Then put it back in straight away and let it bake well. When you want to take it out, take it out again and brush it with dissolved sugar (*****er lasnen zucker*****) and put it back in for a while. That way, it will turn nicely brown from the sugar. It should also be sprinkled with rosewater, that way it is proper.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivnfmmypf3id1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27a5d69b628c37ae9db5e415a7aee7a8f8924276\n\nAt first glance this is a very rich kind of cheesecake, and there are [parallel recipes in earlier sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/06/english-tart/) suggesting there is a tradition behind it. I am not sure what makes it \u2018English\u2019. It may be the addition of hot fat during the cooking, though I am not sure what difference this actually makes. The filling referred to in the recipe is this:\n\n***46 If you want to make a cheese tart***\n\n***First take a good, sweet, fat cheese that is not old or crumbly (*****resch*****). Grate it small and put the grated cheese into a bowl, as much as you please. Add 2 times as much egg and 4 times as much butter so it can become like a thin batter (*****diner tayg*****), and add a very small amount of flour to it. Stir it well in the bowl, but do not make the batter too thin, so that you can keep it on the tart base (*****boden*****). Last, add some dissolved sugar (*****der lasnen zucker*****) to it. Then bake it nicely small, and when it is baked, sprinkle sugar on it while it is hot. Thus it is proper and good.***\n\nTo approximate the fresh cheese called for here, I decided to go with a Russian style of cheese curd, *tvarog*. I processed it with egggs and butter, but decided to disregard the proportion of the latter \u2013 it would have meant over a pound of butter to a pie shell, which strikes me as implausible. The filling mixed well and turned out creamy and pourable. I opted for the same shallow baking dish and the same [pie crust based on Philippine Welser\u2019s recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/23/two-more-pastry-crust-recipes/) as for the [grape juice tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/10/grape-juice-tart-experiment-ii/) and baked it at the same low tempoerature of 180\u00b0C for about thirty minutes. After the filling had solidified, I poured about a quarter cup of melted butter over it and brushed it with sugar syrup. After returning it to the oven, I was briefly absent from the kitchen and noticed on my return that the filling had thrown up bubbles and the sugar browned spectacularly fast, almost burning in a few places. Clearly this needs close attention.\n\nThe result, once it had cooled, was pretty good. I found it too rich even with the much reduced amount of butter, but not as badly as I had feared. The sharp note of the tvarog was a little out of place, and I think this is one of the few recipes that would be improved by using *quark* or cottage cheese instead. But it was fairly close to modern German cheesecake, mild, sweet, and soft. I can absolutely see the appeal.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1epuf7k/an_english_tart_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1723407638.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1epuf7k/an_english_tart_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I think its a close relative of the traditional (yet slightly more modern) Yorkshire Curd Tart.", "While this isn't the kind of English tart I usually go for, I must admit that this tart may be even more delicious."]}

Stir them about occasionally so they do not burn.***\n\nThe idea of refilling egg shells with various things is common in medieval German recipe collections, and this recipe is easily the most common. It is unusual in having an established name. Kroseier are basically eggshells filled with a mixture of scrambled eggs, seasoning, and raw egg that are cooked, usually roasted, and served in the shell. I am still not quite sure where the name comes from. It may derive from the appearance of the interior which reminded people of innards (*Gekr\u00f6se*). I doubt it has anything to do with the word kross (*crunchy*). These are gratifyingly simple and sound attractive.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

{"title": "A Buccaneer-Themed Wedding Feast (17th c.)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/06/13/the-buccaneer-wedding-feast/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/06/13/the-buccaneer-wedding-feast/)\n\nI apologise for missing more posts yet, but things are returning to a more normal schedule and I hope to be back to regular short recipes soon. Today, I want to post a little about the project that took up so much of my time:\n\nA good friend asked me to cook for the wedding she was hosting of another good friend\u2019s sister, both of whom are in my medieval club. This time, though, the food would not be medieval. The couple had ordered a Cuban-style roast pig from a local butcher and asked me to prepare side dishes in the buccaneer style. I\u2019ve been working \u2013 albeit frustratingly slowly \u2013 on a cookbook based on the seventeenth-century Caribbean, so this was a good opportunity to try my recipes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aj6ocms8pa6d1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=965cc88871a3734c871cf91757657a82489aac4d\n\nWith the main meat dish covered, I decided on two additional meats for variety and to provide for guests who do not eat pork. Fish, as I originally suggested, was disliked by too many and did not make it onto the menu. Instead, I chose to fake it.\n\nThe first dish was a *plastron*, the meat from the back shell of a turtle, as described by Jean Baptiste Labat. Obviously, sea turtles are a protected species and thus unavailable for eating. We went with veal which is the suggested substitute in cookbooks from a time when turtles were still sold. I rubbed a piece of roast with allspice, chili, salt, and cloves, added lemon and orange juice, put some of the peel into the liquid, and slow-baked it in a covered dish. The original recipe envisions the shell filled with the liquid and baked in a slow oven. The result was not comparable, obviously, but reasonably close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i56vxdlapa6d1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05173b9f3820417d603ab131e9ffd0d5367b5d70\n\nThe second fake was *vers du palmiste,* again based on [Labat\u2019s account](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/11/buccaneer-cuisine-breaded-palm-grubs/). He describes the technique of coating unseasoned meat in a spiced breading while it roasted several times, most precisely in his account of eating palm grubs. With a view to the children at the table, and because grubs are very hard to source, we decided to use chicken instead. Coated in a breading seasoned with pepper, nutmeg, and salt, they were easily the most universally popular item.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c92x5vubpa6d1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a1008b51c52eea0b2bdb0420224233f471a9246\n\nA third protein dish made to accommodate vegetarians, but also popular with carnivores, was scrambled eggs seasoned with bitter orange juice. This does not have any link to the Caribbean I am aware of, but is attested both in the fifteenth-century *Registrum Cocinae* and later in various recipe books down to modernity. Most later versions are sweetened, but that seems to be owed to the modern idea that citrus needs to be. It does not. Orange works fine with savoury dishes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzkoimldpa6d1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f3e42bf6529c8185adb73fdf66b28bc8ece624d\n\nThe side dishes to accompany them were less ambitious and more honest: sweet potatoes, carrots in a mustard sauce, and coconut rice. The first is described so universally that it must have been a very common dish. Alexandre Exquemelin claims that the inhabitants of Tortuga ate sweet potatoes with a chili sauce for their first meal daily. They cooked them in pots covered with cloth in very little water, a process that I approximated by steaming. There is nothing exceptional about this dish, but it went well with the other things we had.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzdnoxslpa6d1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9a75c1d1dbdcea02fbc5b9237e2972f91d983c8\n\nLabat is almost lyrical in his description of the gardens of Martinique and mentions that carrots, though imported from Europe, grew extremely well there. The inhabitants, he stated, eat them in mustard sauce or cooked with meat and pureed. Since he also described mustard being a popular condiment on *flibustier* ships, I opted for this as a safely vegetarian option. The sauce is a simple roux, described in French sources of the time. This would have been a bit of a luxury in the Caribbean where wheat flour was expensive, but not implausible. I had hoped to add palm hearts which were cooked in the same way, but there were none to be had.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwsounwmpa6d1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87c7acc7f6a5b1e4632c6e3c318880d64fae4f00\n\nThe third side dish was coconut rice, a dish described by William Dampier. The original was cooked in coconut water after chickens, so it would have absorbed a lot of chicken fat and flavour. In order to keep it vegetarian, I opted for a vegetable stock to which I added rasped coconut, coconut milk (it should have been coconut water, but again this was unavailable) and round-grain rice, which was the type then popular in Europe. Cooked slowly in a crockpot, it turned out delicous, as it always does.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thepow5opa6d1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf44d670ae05ed15ee08a3c16e9eacfb445eaad9\n\nWe served fruit and a small salad with these dishes, artfully arranged by my friend who is much better at these things than I am. Salads were a staple of seventeenth-century festive cuisine, though they were usually much more elaborate than this, and tropical fruit is described by all European explorers with awe. Many settlers ate it so regularly and in such quantities that physicians despaired for their health.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9p5l93qpa6d1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16f0dfa494d5d7c5ecb001712ee2571f65529979\n\nTwo sauces rounded out the meal. One was the [chili sauce so universally described that it must have represented a staple](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/30/buccaneer-cooking-sweet-potatoes-and-pimentade/), probably descended from Native American cuisine, though strongly Europeanised. Labat calls it *pimentade*. The basic approach was a combination of salt, lemon juice, and ground chili peppers, sometimes with an addition of fat or other spices. I opted for some fairly mild chilis (we Germans do not deal well with hot foods as any d\u00f6ner salesman can tell you) with just lemon juice and salt, and the result was quite good.\n\nThe other sauce was a sweet and sour avocado mash, seasoned with lemon juice and sugar as [described again by William Dampier](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/27/further-adventures-in-buccaneer-cookery/). This does not show up in other sources and I suspect it was a rather limited specialty, but it has proven universally popular not just with the plantains he recommends it with.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33givprrpa6d1.jpg?width=3035&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f171a1da34f01fe88bbd8e45f256a15ec2c70f3\n\nTo contribute to the sweet course which also included large numbers of cakes from various guests, I made two kinds of marzipan. Labat describes both in different parts of his account. The first was simply a European-style marzipan substituting peanuts for almonds. Labat was not particularly fond of this, but described that settlers cook it because almonds do not grow in the Caribbean. The second, though, is something he is deeply fond of: A marzipan made with cashew nuts and cocoa nibs. I am not sure what proportion he envisions, but a ratio of 1/4 cocoa to 3/4 cashew yielded a wonderfully chocolatey, though slightly brittle mix. I was in the kitchen when these went out and cannot attest to how popular they were, but when I brought leftovers to work Monday, they disappeared very quickly.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed cooking all of this, meeting lovely people, and feeling welcome and appreciated. The journey by rail was more of an adventure than I would have liked \u2013 there was flood damage to several main lines, and everyone is scrambling to complete overdue repairs before the European Cup \u2013 but that is just one of the usual vexations of living in Germany.

It looks like an early form of puff pastry:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hny5b50tchwc1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=665690092ca7f944287583fe8f446f39ad728294\n\n***71 If you want to make Spanish pastries***\n\n***Take good flour and prepare a dough with clear warm water. Salt it a little and work it well, that way it can be made to stand (last er sych auf setzenn). Prepare a sheet as longf as your woirk surface (das bredt)  is and quite thin. Roll it out with a rolling pin and spread that same  sheet with melted bacon, but only half. Let the fat congeal and roll out  the same sheet on top of itself again (read das selb blat yber ain ander for das selb baldt yber ain walger) and make another eight of these sheets, each over a rolling pin. And (make) as many pastry crusts (hefelin)  as there are people at the table so that everyody has one. Fill them  with what you have of gamebirds, chickens, or other chopped meats of  veal or castrated ram. Bake them in the oven or the pan and serve them  hot.***\n\nThis is interesting, and I think it describes a kind of early pate  feuillet\u00e9. Unfortunately, the key sentence that describes (I think)  folding over the layers of dough over layers of fat depends on a  reinterpretation. The wording as it stands makes no sense.  Interestingly, there is a similar recipe in Marx Rumpolt\u2019s *New Kochbuch* of 1581 that can help us interpret this one:\n\n***46. Prepare a dough with water so that you can roll it  out well and thin. Grease it with melted fresh bacon and roll the dough  up over itself. Make so much that all on top of each other it is as  thick as an arm. And once it is thick (enough), cut it away in pieces,  be they for small or large pastries. If you want to roll it out, moisten  your hands with melted bacon that is not hot so the dough does not  stick to the hands. Again work a pastry case of white dough and set the  other one inside it that you have worked from bacon fat. For this dough  holds up the Spanish one so it does not collapse. And you can fill them  with chopped meat. Cut another piece of Spanish dough so you can make a  top crust. Grease paper with olive oil, set the pastries on it, slide  them into the voven and let them bake. See they do not burn; they burn  easily because there is so much fatness in the dough. Open the lids and  pour in good chicken broth so that the chopped meat does not become dry (herb),  that way it turns out good and well-tasting. This is how you make small  pastries. You can also use this kind of dough with fish.  (clxxiv v)***\n\nThis is still not entirely clear \u2013 and cleartly not exactly the same  thing \u2013 but it is obviously a technique fore layering thin, unleavened  dough with fat to achieve a tener, flaky crust. It is served in  individual portions, likely because it would not hold up well as a large  container. And most importantly, these Spanish pastries are defined not  by what is inside them, but by what is around them. You can put in  whatever meat you like, as long as it is encased in this kind of  proto-puff pastry, it is a Spanish pastry.  This looks like it could use  some experimenting. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of  Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The  recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely  produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have  been made at the request of her mother and was written by an  experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine  Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near  Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der  Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cc7fx5/spanish_pastries_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1713987513.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cc7fx5/spanish_pastries_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Yum! \n\n\nMy mother used to make a similar dish with ground beef spread on dough and rolled up and sliced like a jelly roll. \n\n\nShe is, unfortunately, a terrible cook, and managed to make them dry and flavourless (she could ruin boiling water, I swear), but I could definitely see trying this with bacon and expect better results."]}
{"title": "Apple Preserve and a Fritter (c. 1440)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/02/apple-preserve-and-a-fritter/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/02/apple-preserve-and-a-fritter/)\n\n Two more recipes from the Mondseer Kochbuch, with another parallel to Meister Hans and one of my favourite sauces: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epbr9ooppx3c1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=248a40d579f7ba9c737b0ddadf96c3aff7094061\n\n***141 Doberiz sauce***\n\n***A sauce (condiment).  Take sour apples after St. Martin\u2019s day. Peel them and cut them thinly.  Lay them in honey drink and let them boil until they become brown and  black. You can keep this for a year. This sauce is called Doberis. You can also make krapfen with it.***\n\n***142 To prepare a kuochen with doberis***\n\n***If you wish to prepare a good kuochen,  prepare a sheet of two eggs. Take doberis and dilute it with boiling  water so much that it will stick. Spread it on the sheet on four corners  and all across, and tie it together. Dredge it through egg batter and  work it with a rolling pin so that it becomes as thin as a reed (halm), and prepare it like a kuochen.***\n\n[*Doberiz* or *dewericz* is mentioned in several sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/23/experiments-in-sausage-making-iii-renaissance-liver-sausage/),  and the recipe is simple: \u201cHonigtrank\u201d and apples are cooked together  until the mixture turns brown. I used to interpret that as a slight  change of colour, but it is possible to keep cooking it down until it  gets quite dark and firms up. The second recipe suggests that this is  the intent. The *doberis* is softened with boiling water, an  approach that works for firm jellies or fruit leathers. We should assume  that it is quite hard in its stable state. \n\nThe *kuochen* in recipe 142 is a little harder to parse. In modern German, *kuchen* means  a cake, usually a little denser and more flavourful than American  cakes, but fundamentally the same thing. Here, it clearly doesn\u2019t. In  fifteenth-century sources, the word sometimes applies to fried patties,  fritters, and even meat-filled pancakes. The point seems to be a solid  dish made with flour that is baked or fried to a firm consistency. We seem to be aiming for something like that here. \n\n The wording of the recipe is not entirely clear, but I think it  describes one of the complex fritters that were fashionable at the time.  They were filled with strongly flavoured sauces, often coloured, and  served in a way that revealed their intricate internal structures. The  \u2018sheet of two eggs\u2019 most likely refers to a dough in which the eggs are  ingredients. There are [fritters that use fried egg](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/07/filled-sheets-of-eggs-a-complex-fritter/), but they would not roll out as this one does. The dough is spread with *doberiz* all  over and \u2013 I think \u2013 rolled or folded up. The reference to tying up may  be a scribal error or a reference to securing the dough with string.  The sequence of the following steps may be reversed \u2013 it makes more  sense to first roll out the dough and then coat it in batter \u2013 or the  coating is stiffer and more flexible than I envision it. Finally, the  roll is fried and served. This technique, if carried out successfully,  would produce a delicate, flaky structure smaller than would be easily  made by hand. Confectioners use a similar effect to produce small images  in sweets today. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

Here, we are looking at the recipes that  made it into the Mondseer Kochbuch. It is an interesting class of  dishes, something like a Flammkuchen or Speckkuchen, I suspect, and it  works well as an entry-level dish for people who do not trust exotic  foods, but enjoy meat. Fladen generally were flat breads, generally with  some kind of topping, that were baked in the residual heat of an oven  after the bread was removed. These, using expensive meats, cheese, and  spices, likely had their own oven or were baked under an upturned bowl  in the embers. If we can trust the *Buoch von guoter Spise*, they could be very large. We can imagine them served like a large pizza, set down in the middle of the table. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

In honour  of this, I am taking a break from the Innsbruck MS to give you a  potentially delicious recipe from Anna Wecker\u2019s cookbook:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fifteenth-century hat from Sweden - a possible beginners' model](https://preview.redd.it/zxehmh5df86b1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91e9ec9e5ede1f90361095cb4ec49fea934ec289)\n\n***A very hearty/delicious baked dish***\n\n***Take four or six egg yolks, beat (rei\u00df?) them well, add a*** **Loth** ***or two of rosewater and fat the size of a (wal-)nut. Take three*** **Loth** ***of good cinnamon, two*** **Loth** ***of ginger, half a*** **Loth** ***of long pepper, half a*** **Loth** ***of  nutmeg, grind it cleanly. Keep half the cinnamon and grind it coarsely  so that it is long. Put all the rest into the eggs together with ten or  twelve*** **Loth** ***of pure, bolted fine sugar and a little salt, and work it into a dough as though for snowballs (Schneeballen) and other such baked dishes with fine, clear white flour.***\n\n***Then, have a nice, glazed mould in the shape of a hat as  you like it that should be hollow inside and have three feet on the  inside along the brim. Pull the dough over that and make it shaped like a  hat, mould a string around it, place it by the fire, but not too close,  and put proper embers underneath, and turn it around regularly until it  is baked enough.***\n\n***Then take a*** **Loth** ***or three or four of sugar, boil it with good rosewater to a strong syrup (starcken Julep)  and anoint the hat everywhere well with a small brush. Then strew the  coarsely ground cinnamon all over it, and when it has hardened a bit,  take it off the mould and it will look like a grey felt hat.***\n\n***This is also a dish for the morning for old and weak people, with a drink of*** **Malvasier** ***(malmsey  \u2013 Monemvasia wine from Greece). And in many places, servants have this  custom when they sit in stores or where they must do their business in  the winter, when they have to be in the cold much. It should be about  the thickness of two knifes.***\n\nThis should be worth trying out if only for the effect it could have  as the centrepiece of a banquet, or any hastily made vow to \u2018eat your  hat\u201d, and despite the copious quantity of spices used, I think it will  be quite tasty.\n\nThe fact that we have relatively exact quantities on many ingredients  is also unusual. The dough is obviously very luxurious, possibly almost  more of a sugarpaste than a flour dough depending on how much flour you  use. The *Loth* given here is most likely the Nuremberg measure which comes to around 16 grammes.\n\nThe challenge of procuring a glazed pottery mould in the shape of a  hat has deterred me so far, but the more I look at it, the more I become  convinced some kind of substitute could be found. Treating the hot  surface with a heavy syrup to attach coarsely ground cinnamon bark  fibres will take figuring out \u2013 I am sure there is a trick to it. But on  the whole this sounds like a wintertime project worth wasting some time  on.\n\nIn 1598, Anna Wecker, the widow of a respected physician, published  her K\u00f6stlich New Kochbuch. It mostly deals with invalid cookery, but  also includes many recipes found in other cookbooks of the time. Its  particular strength lies in the detailed description of cooking  techniques it occasionally gives.

The dumpling recipe,  which already featured [here](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/10/dumplings-with-boiled-veal-from-the-oeconomia/), is from the Oeconomia and is actually not associated with peasants except through the company it keeps:\n\n \n\n[Finished dumplings](https://preview.redd.it/krnv1ck1rwsa1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=662f349966684cdf5c741a5a8556ec5bd21ea993)\n\n**Of veal dumplings**\n\n***(marginalia: Making veal dumplings)***\n\n***Chop raw veal together well and chop good pieces of bacon  with it. Add finely cut parsley and chop it with the rest. Break 3 or 4  eggs into it and strew in pepper, saffron and ginger. Bring pure butter  to the boil, drop in the dumplings with a spoon and let them boil. But  you must only cook them over coals or they will become too burned (*****pr\u00fcntzlich*****).  And you must also not stir them with the spoon, but only shake the pot.  Then take them out and lay them with boiled veal and let them cook  along with it. The rear quarters of the calf are the best, they are  nicely meaty.***\n\nThis was  an easy recipe to get right: A pound of ground veal from  the Turkish butcher with about 125 grammes of chopped bacon, some  parsley, pepper, ginger, a little extra salt (not much because of the  bacon) and a two eggs. The proportions worked out, and though I think  they would be improved by adding breadcrumbs, that may just be my German  soul speaking. \n\n \n\n[Frying in the pan](https://preview.redd.it/3bwbiol4rwsa1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb2539bda385ad2f8b1b639a2695b275cf131682)\n\nWe fried the first batch at a gentle heat and they turned out well,  though they took a good deal longer than I expected. Because we wanted  to eat before sundown, we baked the second batch instead and they also  turned out very nicely. Then I looked to a sauce to serve with them and  returned to an association I had come across frequently: [Peasants eat garlic and onions](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/25/garlic-and-onions-according-to-meister-eberhard/). Hieronymus Bock writes in the 1550s:\n\n***But in summer our peasants, when hay is made and grain  harvested, drink all manner of water as they can get it, and they eat  much onions and garlic upon it. Thus the raw, evil water is distilled  and digested and what is evil in it departs from them with great steam  and foul smell. Thus they rarely suffer harm from drinking water, for  which they should thank the egyptian gods, onions and garlic.***\n\n \n\n[Onion garlic sauce](https://preview.redd.it/9du1ltb6rwsa1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b60699f46af84f1cae960e60a985d8a7ec3dcb9)\n\nOf course the assertion that onions and garlic are the sauce of the  peasants may refer to them being eaten raw, but I recalled a few recipes  for [complex onion sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/11/onion-sauce-for-lords-and-commoners/) and wanted to see if they could be simplified. \n\nWe chopped onions and garlic, sauteed them in pork fat, added broth,  put in some salt and pepper and kept the pot simmering, adding liquid as  needed, for about two hours. The result was excellent: rich, unctuous,  with a touch of sweetness and a mild, but noticeable garlic tang. We had  it with all our dumplings. I have, sadly, not yet found any evidence  that this was prepared, but we now know that it could be done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12gskqn/veal_dumplings_and_onion_sauce_late_16th_century/", "created_utc": 1681067513.0, "score": 12, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12gskqn/veal_dumplings_and_onion_sauce_late_16th_century/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

I am a bit irked with myself for not having found it earlier, but I  still think the effort was worth it for the culinary-minded among us.  Here is the last major piece of the wedding feast, an improvised course  of fried eggs: \n\n ***Bertschi said: \u201cIt is all lost everywhere anyway.\u201d He  filled a nutshell with wine (most), that was properly poured.  \u201cKochunsauber (lit. cook-dirtily), bring out the wine\u201d he called to his  servants, \u201cAnd tell him to fry up four eggs! We must stave off  starvation!\u201d And behold, this was quickly done.***\n\n***By now, the gentlemen had begun shouting: \u201cBring us wine! The fish want to swim!\u201d But it availed them nothing. All the perry (*****piermost*****) and cider (*****\u00f6pfgeltranch*****) and all the sloe water (*****schlechenwasser*****),  too, had already been served. But they were brought a bucket of sour  milk, and they gladly drank that. R\u00fcefli raised the bucket to his mouth  at that time and turned away to face the wall, which suited him well. He  took such a mighty draught that it displeased the bride and she began  to scold him: \u201cI think you have fallen asleep in the bucket, or have you  drowned in the milk?\u201d she said. That made R\u00fcefli laugh, and what did  the milk do? It went right up into his brain and out of the nose again,  back into the bucket. He offered the drink to the others and the bucket  passed from one to the other. But L\u00e4renchopf (lit. empty-the-glass)  spoiled it. He did not find enough milk and threw the bucket against the  wall.***\n\n***Now the fried eggs were done and were served to the  companions. Now was the time to grasp firmly, and they truly did so.  They acted according to their old custom and fought for the eggs (no different from wild bears) with hands and feet. Nobody could stop them.  He who came first did best for himself; He took everything, and that was  that. Chrimbolten got one egg, Scheubinsak (lit. put-in-the-bag) got  two, and Chnotz and Troll had caught the fourth. Thus the spoils were  divided. Count Purkhart with the ganglion cyst (*****mit dem \u00fcberp\u00e4n*****)  said: \u201cWe are not pleased by this game, I and my companions. The worst  sharers are those who will allow one person to get drunk while another  dies of thirst.\u201d Thus he reached out straightaway and took an egg from  Scheubinsak, but he did it so firmly and clumsily that the soft part ran  through his hands. He thrust the fingers into his mouth and licked it  off, that did him good.***\n\n***Then spoke J\u00e4nsel: \u201cGive me some, too!\u201d \u201cBe quiet\u201d, he said, \u201cyou are a fool (*****gauch*****).\u201d  The long nails on his thumb helped him scoop out the egg. Scheubinsak  held on to the other one. He split it quickly and thrust a large slice  of bread through the middle of it, back and forth. Thus the yolk and the  white ran off uselessly, except that the cats got hold of it and  smoothed their tongues with it. \u201cNo matter\u201d, the man said then, \u201csomeone  who fortune will not smile on must lose a king\u2019s treasure and an  emperor\u2019s power overnight.\u201d***\n\n***Chrimbold had watched carefully and grasped his egg  entirely, threw it straight into his mouth and would have choked to  death if his gullet had not been so wide the egg dropped down into the  stomach whole. Then he said: \u201cHow good, how good! Now my share is safe  from you.\u201d***\n\n***Chnotz and Troll were two fellows that none dared stand  against. They took comfort in that knowledge and they were also quite  clever. They grasped their egg together and opened it carefully. Eating  mannerly, they gently dipped their bread slices in the egg, moistened  them slightly, and threw them into the gates of their mouth. They did  not swallow the slices entire, but dipped what remained of them into the  egg again, and once more moved them to the mouth\u2019s gate. They continued  doing this until no bread was left on the table. All the others watched  them like wolves watch a cow. There was one part of the egg left yet,  but they held it fast, they would not part with it (*****es was nicht vail*****).  They wanted two more loaves of bread, but none was found anywhere in  the house. Then what was left for the poor? Truly, I cannot say. They  scolded the host and gave the egg to the servants so they would remember  to bring them something to drink.***\n\nAs [I pointed out before](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/21/wittenwilers-wedding-feast-v-a-heroic-death/),  this is the kind of vicious mockery of the peasantry that was  unfailingly popular in German literature for many generations and should  not be taken seriously as an account of actual manners. Well-mannered  diners were expected to show restraint at the table, and the image of  doltish thugs fighting over food must have had a certain cathartic  quality for a bourgeois readership. \n\nThe description of the dish is more interesting. These are clearly  fried eggs, not boiled, and they are served without their shell \u2013 they  can be split with long fingernails \u2013 and with a soft centre. Thus they  were most likely cooked immersed in hot fat, ancestors of the *airimschmaltz* that were so popular throughout the sixteenth century. A similar recipe features in my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook), and this adds guidance to its most plausible preparation.  \n\nThe manner of eating them, too, is interesting. When they are not  devoured in undignified haste for fear of greedy rivals, the custom is  to open up an egg and use bread to dip into the liquid yolk. We should  not trust any quantity given in this poem \u2013 four eggs for a wedding  company is ridiculously little \u2013 but it is clear that a small amount of  egg was supposed to go with a larger quantity of bread. This is a  general pattern in medieval dining. The poem also calls attention to the  practice of double-dipping, most likely something the author  disapproves of. Letting anything that had already been bitten off come  in contact with shared food was considered uncouth and disgusting.\n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem *Der Ring* (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in  Constance around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure,  and deceit set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but  seems to have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough  achieved by satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct.  In this, it resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself  to translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners,  but would advise anyone with an interest in the period to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/127sivf/how_not_to_eat_eggs_wittenwilers_wedding_feast/", "created_utc": 1680283455.0, "score": 12, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/127sivf/how_not_to_eat_eggs_wittenwilers_wedding_feast/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Altogether, it was a success: \n\n \n\n[ The main course: coconut rice with chicken, beans, sweet potatoes with  chili sauce, salt pork with peanuts, maize grits, plaintains with  avocado sauce, mock turtle with mustard and \\(in the closed pot\\) shrimp  in orange sauce ](https://preview.redd.it/in7fv55sqbqa1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0374eed649bdc7cbccd6c1ca96352415d254514d)\n\nI revisited some recipes I had tried [in an earlier session](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/06/buccaneer-cooking-and-fun-news/)  and several new ones, and the results generally left everyone happy.  The centrepiece this time was \u2018mock turtle\u2019. I used veal and pork in  place of turtle which, for obvious ethical and practical reasons, is out  of the question, though it was a common meat in the seventeenth-century  Caribbean. The preparation was based on what Jean Baptiste Labat wrote  about flibustier parties in his account of the French Antilles: \n\n***This is what one calls a turtle boucan and how it is  prepared: The largest of the four turttles that had been caught was  chosen and without cutting it on the head or legs, it was opened on one  side to tear out all the inside. Then the back shell (*****plastron*****)  of one of the others was lifted off and after having taken out the  flesh and the fat, all of that was chopped together with what had been  taken out of the first (turtle), with hard-boiled egg yolks, fine herbs,  spices, lemon juice, salt and strong chili, and all this chopped matter  (forcemeat) was put into the turtle that had remained whole and  afterward its opening was closed and shut with a piece of clay (*****terre grasse*****).***\n\n***While the cooks were occupied with what I have told, a  hole six feet in diameter and four or five feet deep was dug in the  sand. The hole was filled with wood and this was allowed to burn down  until it was just coals in order to heat the entire depth (*****concavit\u00e9*****)  of the hole well. Then the coals were removed and the turtle laid into  the hole on its back, covered with three or four inches (*****pouces*****)  of hot sand from its surrounding and the coals which had been removed,  with a little sand above. this became like a natural pasty (*****pat\u00e9 naturel*****)  cooked in that kind of oven in the space of about four hours, and it  cooked better than if it had been prepared in an ordinary oven. And that  is what is called turtle boucan (*****boucan de tortue*****).*** \n\nNow, obviously this is not everyday food. The occasion Labat describes is *flibustiers* holding  a beach party for the governor, so they are putting in extra effort.  However, there is nothing about the dish or its preparation that would  limit it to the tables of the rich and powerful. This could easily have  made the centrepiece of a buccaneer celebration. \n\nThe problem is that it is very hard to simulate turtle. Most European  \u2018mock turtle\u2019 recipes of the eighteenth and nineteenth century use veal  and pork, and so did I. I wrapped a piece of thin-cut meat around a   forcemeat stuffing with boiled egg yolk, lemon juice, chili, ginger,  allspice, and salt and secured it with string. Then I wrapped the whole  thing in several layers of foil and cooked it at a low temperature. The  result was positive, but in need of improvement. \n\nThe flavour was  excellent, though it would have benefited from more  assertively using salt and chili. the foil, however, did not hold well  enough and too much of the juices ran out. They were excellent, but  should have stayed with  the meat. A salt crust or a roasting dish  closed with water paste would probably serve better. Also, the veal was  soft and tender, but the pork was probabnly too sheer. Turtle was famous  for its unctuous softness. Next time, a  fattier, streakier meat with  more connective tissue may work better. But on the whole, it is a recipe  worth developing further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ left to right: mustard, pig fat with chili and lemon juice after Exquemelin, avocado sauce after Dampier ](https://preview.redd.it/g0rb3frvqbqa1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=872b73a31d1b674c6c12494d59ed84eb244e480b)\n\n I added mustard because Labat writes the *flibustiers* will  always eat mustard with their meat. This version added a little molasses  and allspice to the mustardseed and vinegar (I used white wine  vinegar  instead of the sugarcane vinegar described in the sources because I did  not have the time to make that myself). It turned out quite  satisfactory, and has a nice flavour balance of sweet and sharp.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/123vmey/further_adventures_in_buccaneer_cookery/", "created_utc": 1679941455.0, "score": 13, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/123vmey/further_adventures_in_buccaneer_cookery/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["This is absolutely enthralling!

The [Wahre Hoveschheit](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hoveschheit-Translation.pdf)  (true courtesy) is a Tischzucht or book of table manners most likely  produced in the fifteenth century for a monastic community in Westfalia.  It specifically addresses members of cloistered orders with the goal of  teaching lower-class members proper conduct in polite company, but the  rules described in it are applicable more widely.\n\nThe *Wahre Hoveschheit* very likely enjoyed some popularity  within its limited area, given two manuscript copies survive. It was  first edited in the nineteenth century, but relatively little has been  done with the text since. I produced a translation for the Society for  Creative Anachronism\u2019s (SCA) magazine Tournaments Illuminated in 2012  and have finally found the time to review it and post it here.\n\nWe do not know the author or origin of the text, but looking at its  structure it appears to be cpomplete as it was intended. It begins with  an introduction explaining the need to learn proper deportment for  members of cloistered orders. This is followed by lengthy explanations  of manners at table and, more concisely, general conduct in polite  company and when visiting people in their homes. The final paragraphs  seem to lose cohesion. They outline responding to challenges to the  authority of the clergy and church, cast in terms of \u2018foolish questions\u2019  and especially envision debates with Jews. The recommended responses  vary from claiming lack of education to brushing off the questions or  insulting the questioner. Especially the attitude to Jews is crassly  hostile. I included a translation of this part, but do not in any way  share the  underlying assumptions in case this needs spelling out.\n\nIt is  quite unlikely that clergy in Westfalia in the 1400s would  have interacted much with Jews. Jewish communities had dwindled and in  many cases been expelled or destroyed in the 14th and 15th century in  most cities. More likely, they serve as a rhetorical foil, an imaginary  opponent  against whom the aggressive insults that the reader may have  wanted to hurl at his fellow Christians were permitted. What we can  imagine is members of holy orders, especially those with  little formal  education, facing challenges from an educated, earnestly pious, and  increasingly anticlerical laity. That is the more likely context here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11ugp8f/wahre_hoveschheit_a_15th_century_low_german/", "created_utc": 1679121727.0, "score": 13, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11ugp8f/wahre_hoveschheit_a_15th_century_low_german/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Tonight\u2019s is an addition to the [jelly recipes  from de Rontzier](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/01/galantine-jelly-recipes-from-de-rontzier/) that I thought deserved a post of its own:  \n\n \n\n[Apothecary, woodcut by Jost  Amman 1568 courtesy of wikimedia commons](https://preview.redd.it/himbh0r9dsma1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f47b0f25b477770a49880b45db231e80f7fc46)\n\n***20 Item if you would have multicoloured jelly (*****bunten Gallert*****), you shall prepare a round or square thing (*****rund oder viereckicht Ding*****)  of tin or sheet metal. Take of all kinds of colours of cool jelly, each  in the same quantity, and then you pour one colour after the other into  the bowl this way: Once one colour has set, you pour on the next  straightaway and so on, until they have all been put in on top of each  other. Once the jelly has stood for one night, invert (*****lesset*****) it out of the bowl onto a table. Then you cut it into thin or thick slices and lay them in a silver dish or confit dishes (*****Confectschalen*****) and serve them.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe, though cursory. It reminded me  of  somewthing I read in Balthasar Staindl\u2019s Kochbuch, so I went and  checked. Here it is: \n\n***1.xviii Item jellied (*****gesulzte*****) almond (*****milk*****) that has colours as you please***\n\n***Almond milk (*****der Mandel*****)  is white by itself. Make it yellow with saffron. Make it green with  parsley. You shall take red from the apothecary, something that one  calls a coloured cloth (*****farbtuoch*****)  from the apothecary. You boil that and it makes the water red with  which you may temper (prepare) the almond milk. But you must boil  isinglass with it and mnis it well with sugar, just like egg cheeses (*****Ayrkae\u00df*****).***\n\n***xix Item you make brown colour thus: Take ground almond milk and*** [***cherry*** ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/27/a-cherry-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/)[***sauce*** ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/22/cherry-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)***(***[**Weichselsalssen**](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)***), thus the almond milk becomes brownish-black (*****braunschwartz*****).  Take clove powder and water in which isinglass has been boiled, boil  peas in that, strain the pea broth through a cloth and sweeten it with  sugar. This turns black.***\n\n***To make red colour***\n\n***xix Make it thus: Take water in which isinglass has been  boiled, sweeten it and strain it through a cloth. Then take red colour  from a bonded apothecary (*****einem geschwornen Apotecker*****) let the above water cool, stir in the colour and pour it soon, It will set, pour it in whatever shape you wish.***\n\n***To make almond cheese that has any colours you wish***\n\n***xx Make it thus: Pour the above described colour into a cup (*****becher*****)  and let it set one finger thick. Then pour in another colour on top,  but not hot, only cold or it will flow into the other. Pour in of  colour(s) as many as you wish until the cup is full (*****vil*****, lit. much). When it has boiled and set (*****gesotten und gestanden*****),  thrust the cup into hot water and take it out again soon. Invert it  over a serving bowl, thus you have all the colours. Then cut the pounded  almond (the almond jelly) lengthwise, then you see the colours one  after the other.***\n\nHere we  have some more details on the colouring process and a clear  description of inverting a jelly by using hot water to loosen it. The *becher* involved  could be quite large, so the resulting jelly might well be very  substantial. Unfortunately, I lack good pictures  for this. Neither do I  have a contemporary depiction nor a  good photo of the attempt I made  at replicating this many years ago. But it can be done. \n\nFranz de Rontzier, head cook to the bishop of Halberstadt and duke of Braunschweig, published his encyclopaedic *Kunstbuch von mancherley Essen* in 1598. He clearly looks to Marx Rumpolt\u2019s *New Kochbuch*  as the new gold standard, but fails to match it in engaging style or  depth. He is thus overshadowed by the twin peaks of Marx Rumpolt and  Anna Wecker. What makes his work interesting is the way in which he  systematically lists versions of a class of dishes, illustrating the  breadth or a court cook\u2019s repertoire. He is also more modernly  fashionable than Rumpolt. Looking to France rather than Italy and Spain  for inspiration, and some of the dishes he first describes may be  genuine innovations.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11n59ww/multicoloured_jellies_1560sstyle/", "created_utc": 1678399314.0, "score": 13, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11n59ww/multicoloured_jellies_1560sstyle/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Towards the end of the book, we find two recipes for it: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uj5xu01118ha1.jpg?width=705&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a2eed99eb1a70160d014b0f33c2e54b2eb0c382\n\n***78 A*** **Trisanet**\n\n***Take half a pound of sugar, one*** **Lot** ***ginger, one cinnamon, one*** **quintelin** ***mace, one*** **quintlein** ***galingale, pound it small with the ginger and the cinnamon bark.***\n\n***79 Another Good*** **Trisanet**\n\n***Take two pounds of sugar, three*** **Lot** ***of cinnamon, two*** **Lot** ***of ginger, two*** **Lot** ***of galingale, one*** **Lot** ***of mace, one*** **quintlin** ***cardamom, a*** **quintlin** ***peppercorns.***\n\nThese spice mixtures are interesting, and noticeably milder than[ the one we got from a fifteenth-century source](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/). The dominant note is sweet, suggesting more than a passing relationship with the *Zimtzucker* of  modern German cuisine. The exact weights are not easy to gauge since  just about every town in Germany had slightly different standard  measures, but the relations are stable. Assuming, as is likely, that the  recipes use trade weights rather than apothecary weight, they are 1  pound = 32 Lot, 1 Lot = 4 quintlein. Using the [Nuremberg trade pound](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrnberger_Ma%C3%9Feinheiten#Gewichtsma%C3%9Fe), that makes (rounded to the nearest gramme):\n\nRecipe #78:  255 g of sugar, 16 g of cinnamon, 16 g of ginger, 4 g of  mace and 4 g of galingale\n\nRecipe #79: 1,019  g of sugar, 48  g of cinnamon, 32 g of  ginger, 32  g of galingale, 16 g of mace, 4 g of cardamom and 4 g of pepper\n\nGiven how  commonly these are referred to in the recipes, it would make sense to keep a jar on hand in the kitchen. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

{"title": "The Tomato's Journey to Europe", "selftext": "Hi CulinaryHistory!\n I have a blog focusing on culinary history (among other things).  Here is a sample from a recent post about plants indigenous to the America's and their journey to Europe. I hope you can get some value from it, and if you would like more similar content, check out my blog at [metta.earth](https://metta.earth/). \n\nTomatoes\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThink of the classic tomato dishes: Pasta/pizza sauce, salsa, bruschetta, caprese, etc.  All of these, with the exception of salsa, are European dishes.  But Tomatoes weren't always European (at least we think).  We think this because the earliest known use of the tomato is from an Aztec source around 500 ACE.  Because we don't know the exact genetic history of the Aztecs, we don't know which migration from the Old World they were a part of.  The first being around 15,000 BCE from northern Russia and the second being from the Pacific Islands around 10,000 BCE (most think that Aztecs were a mix of people from both migrations). This means that they may have brought ancient ancestors of tomato over with them. And there is some debate over this, but more likely than not, the tomato was a Mesoamerican native that was domesticated on its own turf. \n\nWhile the tomato is loved by many Asian and African cultures, Its migration to these regions is by European proxy.  Spanish conquistadors who, in 1521, pillaged the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan found themselves with an abundance of the New World curiosity and began shipping it back to Spain.  This is when the first tomatoes are thought to have come to the Old World.  Though there is some speculation whether Christopher Columbus may have done this earlier, in 1493.  \n\nSpanish imperialism plays an important role in these early days.  Their reach went into the Philippines and the \"West Indies\" (a ridiculous and archaic name for a medley of Caribbean nations).  And with the help of the tomatoes self-promoting flavor, they spread not only throughout these regions but throughout all of Asia, but that's another story. \n\nTomatoes, in Europe, were not popular at this time.  Many people distrusted the small shiny yellow fruit. This was probably due to their poisonous leaves and membership in the Nightshade family.  But a perhaps more obvious reason is the lack of context needed to prepare it.  Europeans were in a salsa echo chamber and continued to make salsa-like dishes until about the 18th century. But slowly these salsas would become less spicy and with the addition of european herbs, like parsley and basil, take on a new and incredibly popular flavor\n\nIt seems strange that something so integral to European (specifically Italian) cuisine would be mostly dormant until only about 300 years ago.  It wasn't until Italians began obsessing over them that the Tomato would begin its evolutionary explosion, being cultivated in different regions to become some of the varieties that we recognize today.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/5kunbf/the_tomatos_journey_to_europe/", "created_utc": 1482982647.0, "score": 11, "author": "MettaCulinary", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/5kunbf/the_tomatos_journey_to_europe/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Garlic Sauce for Chicken (15th  c.)", "selftext": "This sauce from the Dorotheenkloster MS looks very good indeed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qglbq87gioe1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13d910aa122bd4822238e3a1d042d5e62ba00e64\n\n***183 A sauce (condiment) with roast chickens***\n\n***Grind garlic with salt, and peel the heads well. Mix 6 eggs into it without their whites, and add vinegar and a little water, not too sour. Let it boil up so it stays thick. You can make (serve) roast chickens with this or whatever you wish. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nMedieval upper-class cuisine had a complicated relationship with garlic. On the one hand, it stood for everything antithetical to gentility: growing in the earth, cheap, plentiful, and pungent. It made you smell like a peasant. On the other hand, they were not going to forgo something that just tasted this good. This sauce is one example of this.\n\nGarlic, salt, egg yolks, and vinegar would make for a rich, creamy, and uncluttered flavour that should appeal to modern tastes as much as to medieval. Absent oil or fat, this is not aioli but a sauce that surely required very careful heating to produce the egg liaison that held it together without curdling the egg yolks. This also illustrates nicely the complexity behind the verb sieden. I usually render it as \u2018boil\u2019, but it really covers all forms of heating food in liquid, from a rolling boil to a gentle simmer. Here, we are probably talking of slow, gentle heat to induce the sauce to thicken before it is served, stopping just as the surface begins to stir.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/13/garlic-sauce-for-chicken/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/13/garlic-sauce-for-chicken/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1jaksx2/garlic_sauce_for_chicken_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741895022.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1jaksx2/garlic_sauce_for_chicken_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Maybe I\u2019m missing something but do you have more info of you making this sauce?

{"title": "More on Blanc Manger (15th c.)", "selftext": "If there is one dish no medieval recipe collection can be without, it seems to be blanc manger, chicken breast cooked with almond milk and rice. The Dorotheenkloster MS has three such recipes:\n\n***126 A courtly gm\u00fcs of old chickens that is called plamencher***\n\n***Take \u00bd pound (talentum) of almonds. Let the chickens boil until they are tender, blanch the almonds and pass them through with clean water. Take a quarter pound (virdung) of rice and pick it clean, pound it, and pass it through a cloth or sieve. Take the meat of the hens and chop it small. Boil the almond (milk), put in the meat of the hens and mix it together. Let the almond milk boil until it it is done (zeitig) and add a pound (phunt) of pig fat (sweinens smaltz). When it begins to thicken, pour in the pig fat and stir it vigorously. As soon as it begins to boil, add a quarter pound (virdung) of sugar. When it is boiled halfway, add the sugar and let it boil well, and keep doing that until it gives back (separates out) the fat. Thus the dish is prepared. Serve it with a good, solid spoon that is deep (nust) enough, and spread it out with the spoon so it becomes smooth. That gemuez is called plamanscher.***\n\n***138 A blanc manger (plamenschir)***\n\n***Take thick almond milk and chicken breasts that were picked apart (gezaist). Add them to the milk and stir it with rice flour. Add enough fat and enough sugar, and serve it.***\n\n***139 Again a blanc manger (plamenschir)***\n\n***Take picked apart and (probably an unnecessary conjunction rather than a lacuna) chicken breasts and good almond milk. (Put) the stirred chicken into the milk with rice flour and colour it well with colourful flowers. Add enough fat and boil it very well. Add enough sugar, that is called a plamanschir.***\n\nI talked about the issue of names before, and it is evident again here: This dish has many. Whether it is described innocuously [as a zuckermus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/11/blancmanger-by-yet-another-name/), called by the Latinate fantasy name [Pulverisei](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/21/blancmanger-by-any-other-name/), or by any number of derivations [from its French or Italian designation](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/30/another-blanc-manger/), it is all over the place, and that seems deliberate. Here, we find a names that derive from the French blanc manger. The recipes seem most closely related to those in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) and the [Buoch von guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise), but theyare not exact parallels. Indeed, the third one specifically mentions colouring the resulting dish with flowers which runs counter to the original intent of a white dish, though it would surely make a great canvas for that.\n\nAside from the relative reluctance to adopt foreign names in many instances, what I find interesting is the variety among the terms that make it into the manuscript tradition. Here alone, we find *plamencher*, *plamanscher*, *plamenschir* and *plamanschir*. These are close to the *plamensir* of the Buoch von guoter Spise, and quite a distance from the *plamauschy, bla manschy* or (Italian-influenced) *manschy plamby* of Philippine Welser, let alone the Italianate *manscho blancko* of Marx Rumpolt. Most of these terms are derived from the French, and clearly they are spelled phonetically. This is a salutary reminder that while we study mainly manuscripts, a large part \u2013 quite likely most \u2013 elite culinary culture was oral. Nobody reading a copy of the Viandier would come up with *pla mauschy*, but someone speaking French, even quite well, could easily get there. This, too, changes in the transition to Early Modern print culture, where the joke is on the ignorant person insisting on pronouncing a word as it is spelled (usually possible in German, challenging in French, impossible in English).\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

{"title": "Leeks in Almond Milk (15th c.)", "selftext": "A short recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS today, but an interesting and delicious one:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50ghf427msfe1.jpg?width=1826&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21a6c9ae73dca5b042b91d3d5ff2700b00aa0161\n\n***92 Of leeks***\n\n***Take the white bulbs and (cut) them small. Lay them in cold water overnight. In the morning, take them and press them out, and cook them in boiling water by a good fire. When he has boiled them, pour off the water and pour in almond milk or poppyseed milk. If you wish, cut the fat of sturgeons (or hare? hausen daz vaist) or bacon into it and let it boil.***\n\nThis is the kind of plain but attractive vegetable dish we do not find often in the medieval recipe corpus. Of course it is still elevated by the addition of almond or poppyseed milk (I assume that this is in place of the milk that would normally be used) and the rather enigmatic fat of sturgeon (*hausen*) or, if we assume a copying error, no less unusual hare (*hasen*). At bottom, though, it is the whites of leeks cooked in milk with added fat. I\u2019ve made it frequently and redacted a parallel in my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook).\n\nThere is a parallel for the idea of cooking leeks with milk in the [Munich Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf) recipe collection:\n\n***14 Kraut of leeks***\n\n***Take leeks, greens (krutt) and cabbage and cut them the length of a digit (aines gelides lang). Saut\u00e9 them in fat, pour on water, and let it boil up. Then put it into a sieve so that the water runs off. Lay it into a pot and pour on milk that has been passed through a cloth with white bread, and add fat.***\n\nThis is clearly not the same thing, but it suggests that the practice was widely known. A more interesting thing yet is a[ record from the monastery at Reichenau in 843](https://books.google.de/books?id=yX8Awnfl1VwC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=warmosium&pg=PA107&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) that mentions a dish called *warmosium* to be given to sick brothers. To make it required leeks and the milk of four cows, which are the reason it is recorded in writing (they are provided each by one rent-paying village).

The Dorotheenkloster MS has a series of recipes for these things.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtprszm57tce1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c9887c64b98439a524d73761f78e5a5ef144867\n\n***49 Of all kinds of eggs in Lent***\n\n***Take two pounds (libra) of almonds and pound them small. Grind them with sugar and add a little water so it stays white. You must not let it boil, and it must be moderately thick. You can make eggs out of that this way: Take one part of the almonds mass and colour it red with saffron so it appears like a yolk. Make as many yolks of the red part as you please, the size of egg yolks. Then take a small white cloth and make a hole in it. Lay the yolk into it put the white over it so it is shaped like an egg. Make enough for a dish this way. And \u00bd (pound of?) raisins, wash them and grind them small. Take a slice of a semeln loaf and crumble it into them with sweet wine to make a pheffer sauce with sugar. This is called eggs in pheffer sauce.***\n\n***50 Another dish of eggs***\n\n***Take a few eggs (as described in the previous recipe?) into a reidlen (small cooking vessel) and make halved eggs and lay them in there, as many as you want. And take a quarter pound (vierdung) of sugar and lay it into a pan. When it has melted, you pour it over the eggs. They lie in it as in fat. And take whites of the eggs and milk and make it as thick as soft eggs, and add sugar in place of salt.***\n\n***51 A different dish of eggs***\n\n***Prepare whole eggs and stick them on a spit. Make them black or yellow, and do not forget the sugar.***\n\nThe first recipe is fairly straightforward. These are what we would call marzipan eggs. I am not entirely sure what the role of the cloth is, but other than that it is basically a saffron-coloured yolk surrounded by white almond-sugar paste, a reasonable simulacrum of a hard-boiled egg. They are served in a sweet sauce of raisins thickened with bread which is actually a fairly common recipe for meat sauces, sometimes referred to as a pfeffer. There is a similar, but [much more ambitious recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/12/fake-hard-boiled-eggs/) for faux hard-boiled eggs in their shells in the 16th-century [K\u00fcnstlichs und f\u00fcrtrefflichs Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Culinary-Recipes-from-the-Kuenstlich-und-Fuertrefflichs-Kochbuch.pdf), so the idea did not die out.\n\nThe second and third recipes, I assume, deal with the same faux eggs rather than real ones. In the first half of #50, a strong sugar syrup is used to simulate melted fat and produce the effect of deep-fried *Eier im Schmalz*. Again, we have a[ broadly similar idea](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/04/lenten-fried-eggs-from-the-inntalkochbuch/) in the [Inntalkochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Inntalkochbuch.pdf), but in this case what is simulated is more like pan-fried eggs sunny side up. The second half, I assume, aims to simulate a soft egg dish usding only the white almond paste. In recipe #51, we find sparse instructions for presenting the almond paste eggs like hard-boiled eggs on a spit, another popular conceit on wealthy tables.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Take out the bones everywhere and cut this hot-boiled piece of fish into small pieces and diligently pound it in a mortar as finely as possible. Then take half a pound of good almonds that were also diligently pounded separately and pass the fish and almonds through a sieve with one or two eggs, but no more, and as they are (with whites and yolk). Then take a Seutel full of sugar, add a little rosewater, set it over the coals and let it melt (until it becomes) like water. Take whatever parts of the fish and almonds could not pass through the sieve the first time and pass it through again with this melted sugar. Stir it all together with all diligence and add cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and pepper. There must be more of cinnamon (than of the other spices), and it is most necessary. You may use a little of the other spices according to the occasion and the size of the tart. Make it with its dough and cover of sugar, egg whites, and rosewater as is described for the first tart. This will become a good tart.***\n\nThis is the next recipe in the [sequence](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/20/the-other-white-tart/) [of ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/22/a-black-tart/)[tarts ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/24/a-very-refined-green-tart/)at the end of the manuscript, and certainly a strange idea to modern sensibilities.

It is likely to come out tasting like spicy marzipan. I do not think the fish is going to be very noticeable, though of course that will depend on the proportions which we do not learn. I am not sure it is worth the trying, but if I ever have a piece of cooked trout left over, I may give it a go.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/25/sweet-fish-tart/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/25/sweet-fish-tart/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gzt9x1/sweet_fish_tart_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1732567304.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gzt9x1/sweet_fish_tart_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

[Another brief excerpt](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=Benedictiones) from the *Benedictiones ad Mensas*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsxectpvl9kd1.jpg?width=2297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a51247706209cc2da4372df878f7646d2c58ceae\n\n**159 May the sign of the cross be with these agreeably prepared cakes**\n\n***Grate commentis crucis assint signa Placentis***\n\n**160 Let us eat this agreeable spelt cake marked with the cross**\n\n***Hac cruce signata comedamus Adorea grata***\n\n**161 May the creator bless the life-giving eggs with hope**\n\n***In spem nativa benedicat conditor ova***\n\nThis section, if we can call it that, is shprt and enigmatic, sandwiched between the condiments (I suppose) and the clearly labelled and extensive section on legumes. It is possible that all of the preceding conceptually belongs together in a larger category considered \u2018luxurious\u2019 dishes, but I am not fully convinced of that. However, as to what these three blessings are addressing, I am reduced to speculation.\n\nA *placenta* as mentioned in #159 is originally a flat cake, the word deriving from Greek *plakous*. The most famous recipe is from Cato\u2019s *de agri cultura*, a layered honey cheesecake, but there is no reason to think the name was specific to this kind alone. Givcen the flexibility of cooking terminology over time, by the eleventh century this could have undergone considerable further change. It could be any kind of rich baked item, a prototypical \u2018cake\u2019. In #160, the addition of \u2018cake\u2019 is even more a matter of interpretation. *Adorea* merely means something made from spelt, but since bread was covered in an earlier section, I suspect that a kind of sweet dish is meant. Especially in close association with *placenta* and the following eggs. These, at least, are unequivocal, though their preparation is entirely unaddressed.\n\nWe actually have a number of terms for baked goods that are in some way or other not mere bread surviving from fairly early sources. There are *similum* and *fladones*, *placenta*, *nebulae* and *adoreum*, and we often have no real idea what these things were. Here, the origin of the term and the proximity to eggs suggests we are looking at some kind of egg-enriched cake or pancake. Beyond that \u2013 an omelet, a breadcrumb pancake, a cheese-honey confection in a flour crust, or something entirely different \u2013 we are speculating.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057. Theyare a collection of blessings to be spoken over food. Written in short rhyming couplets in Latin, they are unusual in their attention to the diversity of foods and preparations. This is not a serious work of theology or medicine, but an intellectual diversion, playful verse meant to show off a broad vocabulary and facility with Latin. That is what makes them very valuable \u2013 they give us a glimpse of the mental horizon of a senior cleric of the 11th century at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1eyrvsd/blessing_for_cakes_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1724354047.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1eyrvsd/blessing_for_cakes_11th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Fake Morels from Liver (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/08/faux-morels-from-liver/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/08/faux-morels-from-liver/)\n\nThe collection of Philippine Welser continues with more very traditional recipes, including one for faux morels. Here, they are made with lung:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqwpvgghxhhd1.jpg?width=568&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1f677de18b6b0507ddaaa7fb25fdace3d58c6ab\n\n***140 To make morels (merchenn) from a calf\u2019s lung***\n\n***Take a calf\u2019s lung and boil it and chop it with an egg and grated bread, good spices, and salt. Prepare a piece of wood that is pointed at both ends and as large as a morel. Spread the filling all around the piece of wood and make it the same thickness all around so that it is thickest in the middle. Fry it in fat with the wood, cut it apart around the middle and pull it off the wood. This way, you have two (faux morel heads). You can also prepare a filling of eggs and fill these morels with it.***\n\nMorels were popular mushrooms. In many recipe books, they are the only kind of mushroom featured or the only one named. Typically, morel heads were cooked with a filling of eggs, often [roasted on a skewer](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/11/stuffed-morels-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/), though they could also just be[ battered and fried](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/04/batter-fried-morels-from-cgm-384-ii/). There are also recipes for making fake versions, either [from an egg batter](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/19/faux-morels-for-christmas-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) or from [chicken meat paste](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/09/differently-fake-morels/). This recipe uses a paste of cooked lung, egg, and grated bread instead. Shaping it into morels around a piece of wood and deep-frying them is an interesting technique and something I think I would like to try out one day. I wonder how easily they actually come off.\n\nThis recipe ends with the production of the faux morel heads. A serving suggestion is found in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf):\n\n***20 How to prepare a good fried muos***\n\n***Take (meat) of the breast of a chicken and chop it small, and pound it in a mortar. Add a little flour or bread, pepper and ginger. Salt it in measure, according to the quantity. Stir this well together Cut to small wooden pieces (klupplein) the length of a finger, (shaped) like a spear shaft (eln schafft \u2013 probably read \u201crounded like a spear shaft\u201d). Shape smooth \u2018beaks\u2019 (snebel) in your hands and mould them around the shaft (spis) like a morel. Pull them on the outside so they become uneven (kraus). Lay them in a pan and let them boil with the sticks (stecklen). As you take out one, put in another, and prepare as many as you wish. When they are done, take them out. Stir a chopped muos with butter and fill the morels with it. Stick them on a skewer for a while. Heat them and drizzle them with butter and serve them. You can also prepare morels of pike or of salmon or whatever you wish this way.***\n\nI can imagine such meaty (or fishy) morel heads, filled with a rich scrambled egg stuffing, lined up on a skewer, buttery and hot. It sounds like a perfect cold-weather treat, and indeed the faux recipe from Meister Eberhard is associated specifically with Christmas. By the time of Philippine Welser, this was most likely already a bit oldfashioned, but clearly still popular.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1enfrec/fake_morels_from_liver_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1723147266.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1enfrec/fake_morels_from_liver_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["This is very interesting because it implies that morels were scarcer and more valuable than chicken breast or calves lung.

I may have to ask your patience: I ran across an interesting source, but it may take a bit longer to write up. So there will be a longer post or two at the end of it, but it may take a few more days than usual. For today, from the collection of Philippine Welser:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odr02djckf2d1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cdd16c88af35ff77c7ea7a939cdc9fd0b928cf9\n\n***99 If you want to fry Italian streybla (Strauben)***\n\n***Lay eggs in warm water. Put water in a pan over the fire, salt it, and let it boil. Pour flour into it, stir it quickly, take it off and stir the eggs into it. Stir the batter and make it smooth. Take a funnel that your little finger fits through to half a digit, put the batter into it, and let it pass through it gently into hot fat. Thus it can be an ell or 2 long and does not stick. Take two shovels that are two fingers wide to turn them over and take them out.***\n\nThis is just another variation on the theme of frying choux pastry, much like the [syringe fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/20/piped-fritters-2/). This one is poured through a funnel, also [an established technique](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/13/another-knitwork-fritter/) at that point. In order to flow through a narrow funnel continuously, the batter must be quite liquid, so I am not really sure what to expect, but it sounds worth trying out. The results seem to have been impressive. Two [ells Augsburg measure](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kr%C3%A4mer-Elle) would be almost 120 cm (slightly more if the great ell rather than the linen ell was used), so I assume we are talking about circles or figures piped into a round pan. It is difficult to envision a frying pan this long.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

{"title": "Wafer Fritters (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/21/wafer-fritters/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/21/wafer-fritters/)\n\nAnother set of recipes from Philippine Welser\u2019s collection:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhwnpcquyt1d1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ab902f58ff35b95f097affd43b0a334f9a373c8\n\n***94 If you want to make wafer fritters (mandatten baches)***\n\n***Take almonds and grind or pound them small and see they do not turn oily. Moisten them with rosewater in a timely fashion. Then put in sugar so it turns nicely sweet and grind or pound it well together. Then take wafers and spread this on them, not too thick, otherwise it will not rise. Spread it in the middle (?hergatt) so it turns out smooth. Then cover one wafer with another and press it closed firmly at the edges with rosewater. Cut them as large as you wish, and do not make the almond filling (dayg) too thin. Then prepare a yellow batter with water, pour it on a plate, and dip the wafers into it along the edges, not too deep. Fry them nicely, not too hot so they stay white, and lay them out on a sieve, no other place, otherwise they drop down. Shake the pan when you put them in until they rise.***\n\n***95 If you want to fry filled wafers***\n\n***Take apples and cut thin slices from them. Dust them with flour and fry them well. Then put them into a mortar and pound them well, and take them out into a pan. Add a raisin/grape sauce (wein draube seltz) and set it over the fire. Sugar and spice it as you please and stir it a while over the fire, that way it gains colour. Spread it on the wafers and fry them quickly.***\n\n***96 If you want to make wafer fritters from an electuary (aus latt wery)***\n\n***Take electuary, slice it and soften it in good wine. Take a little cherry sauce and add sugar, cinnamon, and ginger. Pound it or stir it together well. Make it nicely spicy (res), spread it on the wafers, dip them in a yellow batter along the edges and fry the quickly. This is healthy and good.***\n\nWafers, thin and crisp, were used as a base of marzipan, almond cookies, and fritters in medieval Germany. They are usually then known as *Oblaten* (as they still are), a name hinting at their origin in Christian ritual. This recipe knows them as mandatten, but otherwise it is not unusual at all. There are again numerous parallels, including [one I tried out a while ago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/28/experiment-wafer-fritters/). These are larger and only dipped in batter along the edges, others were smaller and dipped into batter entire. Fillings could vary, though fruit confections and almonds are the most common.\n\nHere, we have three distinct fillings. The first recipe calls for what is basically a thin almond paste. The second is a little hardewr to interpret, but it basically is a confection of cooked apple and what sounds like a [raisin-based sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/17/clove-sauce-for-fish-from-the-cgm-349/) to me (but could be one made with[ fresh](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/11/grape-electuary-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/) [grapes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/02/two-sauces-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)). The third is made from an [electuary](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/13/quince-electuary-after-walter-ryff/), which was a [thick paste of fruit](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/10/pear-electuary-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/) cooked with honey or sugar. It is dissolved in wine and mixed with [cherry sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/27/a-cherry-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/), another [popular ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/22/cherry-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)[ingredient ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[of the age](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/06/cherry-sauce-from-section-two-of-cod-pal-germ-551/), to produce a sweet, fruity, and probably quite overpowering filling.\n\nI have poited this out before, but it bears repeating: The fritter culture of South Germany is varied and long-lived, and this particular type is found nearly unchanged in Katharina Prato\u2019s very influential *S\u00fcddeutsche K\u00fcche* (quoting from the 50th edition, Vienna 1912):\n\n***Oblaten-Krapferl (wafer fritters). With wine batter. Cut wafers into rounds, brush them with egg, fill each two and two with cherry flesh, dip them in wine batter, fry them in fat and strew them with sugar.***\n\n***With choux paste: You place small heaps of firm rosehip sauce (Hagebuttensalse) on wafers cut square, cover them with wafers cut to the same shape, and only press them together slightly in the middle so that a space remains between the wafers where there is no sauce. Dip the four corners of the wafers into choux paste thinned with eggs to fill the interstices and fry them in fat. The sauce should shine red through the yellowish cooked wafer, the edges be light brown.***\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

ten reasons**\n\n\n\nHear of the rare tales\n\nThat I will relate\n\nThey walk about in the world;\n\nAs many ideas as there are heads.\n\nI saw in a dream\n\nUnderneath a tree\n\nA beautiful woman met me\n\nAnd received me honourably\n\nI thanked the virtuous lady\n\nShe spoke to me politely:\n\n\u201cSay, kunig, what is your wish?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cLady, I would sit with you.\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cI would ask you one thing\n\nIf it does not make you overproud\n\nYou shall tell me one thing\n\nThis I ask of you, kunig.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cLady, ask me\n\nI will tell you if I can.\u201d\n\nShe said to me quietly:\n\nYou shall counsel me on this:\n\nMen who wear long beards\n\nYou shall tell me about those\n\nWhat they mean to signify\n\nThat you must answer me.\n\nIf a wearer feels it a pleasure or a pain (als sur siech oder als suz)\n\nOr whether he is forced to wear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLady, I will not say that of them\u201d\n\nSaid I \u201cI know of a different meaning\u201d\n\nThe lady said properly\n\n\u201cYou shall let me know this, then.\u201d\n\nWhy the first one wears a beard\n\nI said: \u201cLady, one man bears another ill will\n\nWho has lost his friendship\n\nFor he did him an ill deed\n\nAnd so he vowed by himself\n\nThat he will never cut his beard\n\nUntil he has avenged himself.\n\nThat is why he wears his beard\n\nWhether others like or dislike it.\u201d\n\nOf the second beard\n\nThe lady said \u201cSo tell me more\n\nWhat is the matter with the other one?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second has a different intent\n\nFor he is guilty of a transgression\n\nAnd he will not cut off his beard\n\nUntil he has made restitution\n\nAnd he intends to hold himself to this\n\nSo he will not cut his beard.\u201d\n\nOf the third beard\n\nThe lady now asked mannerly\n\n\u201cNow tell me of the third.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe third would go on pilgrimage\n\nThat is why he is wearing his beard\n\nSo he will not be rid of it\n\nUntil he has completed his pilgrimage\n\nAnd therefore he wears it\n\nOn smooth roads and on crooked ones.\u201d\n\nOf the fourth beard\n\nThe noble lady then asked me\n\nWhat the fourth was thinking\n\n\u201cThe fourth thinks himself too tender (of age)\n\nAnd lets his beard grow out\n\nTo signal his manhood\n\nThat is why he is now wearing a beard.\u201d\n\nOf the fifth beard\n\nThe lady said \u201cThen tell me now\n\nSomething of the fifth man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fifth thinks highly of his beard\n\nAnd is free in his choice\n\nHe thinks to do it for other people\u2019s sake\n\nAnd wears his beard boastfully\n\nMy simple mid teaches me so\n\nIt is said of him, so it is.\u201d\n\nOf the sixth beard\n\nThe lady said \u201cThen tell me quickly\n\nHow is it with the sixth?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sixth is a prisoner\n\nWho longs to be free\n\nSo he wears his beard until\n\nHe is at liberty again.\u201d\n\nOf the seventh beard\n\nThen the noble lady said gently\n\n\u201cWhat motivates the seventh beard?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe seventh man wears it\n\nFor the same reasons as anyone (lit: this and that one)\n\nSo he thinks by himself\n\nTo also wear a beard (i.e. copy the fashion).\u201d\n\nOf the eighth beard\n\nThe lady said: \u201cNow say,\n\nHow does the eighth live?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe eighth is crazy within himself\n\nHe foolishly resolved\n\nTo make love to a lady\n\nAnd he has her on his mind\n\nSo he resolved not to cut his beard\n\nUntil he has had his will with her\n\nThat is why he wears his beard\n\nAnd see how hard it is on him.\u201d\n\nOf the ninth beard\n\nThe lady said: \u201cTell me now\n\nHow do you like the ninth?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ninth wears it for his love\n\nAnd is no secret admirer (minnendieb)\n\nFor he seeks nothing else\n\nBut to also be lovely in her eyes\n\nAnd thinks of the lady of his heart\n\nWhen he shows himself with a beard\n\nIn her service at all times\n\nSee how much it affects him.\u201d\n\nWhy the tenth wears a beard\n\nThen the honoured lady said\n\n\u201cNow tell me this finally\n\nIf you know anything of the tenth\n\nYou shall not keep silent\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, lady, quickly,\n\nThe tenth is obliged to\n\nThose who wear beards in his order\n\nSuffer such pain for God\n\nI cannot think of any other reason\n\nWhy they should be bearded.\u201d\n\nThe lady said: \u201cI am richer\n\nTo have learned this from you.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cKunig, may God reward you\u201d\n\nShe turned around and walked away\n\nWhen I could no longer see her\n\nShe called to me and said:\n\n\u201cKunig, you forgot one thing\n\nThat you must also consider\u201d\n\n\u201cI said \u201cLady, gladly,\n\nTell me, what is it?\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cI would be pleased\n\nIf they did not let their beards\n\nHang in the wine as they drink.\n\nSo that it drips off them.\n\nIt is better to drink\n\nFrom clean twigs\n\nOf sage or hyssop\n\nThan from the hair of their beards.\u201d\n\nI said: \u201cLady, very well,\n\nSo go forth and tell them\n\nI, my gentle lady,\n\nWill not need the reminder.\u201d\n\nThis is an entertaining poem, but it doesn\u2019t tell us very much. The style follows earlier courtly poetry in which a pure beloved lady teaches a knight important lessons and asks questions that precipitate great deeds. The K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald, of course, subverts this trope by bringing it quite solidly down to earth. Here, the narrator is questioned about beards and taught to mind his own while drinking wine. This is not really a difficult feat, but it may have appeared so; In the early 14th century, beards returned to fashion in Western Europe after a long period when clean-shaven was the preferred look. Thus, it would have seemed reasonable to ask why men would choose to wear facial hair, much as the question was raised in the 1960s why men chose to wear their hair long. There was no established etiquette for managing beards yet.\n\nDer K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald (literally king of the Odenwald, a mountain chain in southern Germany) is an otherwise unknown poet whose work is tentatively dated to the 1340s. His title may refer to a senior rank among musicians or entertainers, a Spielmannsk\u00f6nig, but that is speculative. Many of his poems are humorous and deal with aspects of everyday life which makes them valuable sources to us today.\n\nThe identity of this poet has been subject to much speculation. He is clearly associated with the episcopal court at W\u00fcrzburg and likely specifically with Michael de Leone (c. 1300-1355), a lawyer and scholar. Most of his work is known only through the Hausbuch of the same Michael de Leone, a collection of verse and practical prose that also includes the first known instance of the Buoch von guoter Spise, a recipe collection. This and the evident relish with which he describes food have led scholars to consider him a professional cook and the author of the Buoch von Guoter Spise, but that is unlikely. Going by the content of his poetry, the author is clearly familiar with the lives of the lower nobility and even his image of poverty is genteel. This need not mean he belonged to this class, but he clearly moved in these circles to some degree. Michael de Leone, a secular cleric and canon on the W\u00fcrzburg chapter, was of that class and may have been a patron of the poet. Reinhardt Olt whose edition I am basing my translation on assumes that the author was a fellow canon, Johann II von Erbach.\n\nI only translate the poems that deal with aspects of food or related everyday life here. There are several others which are less interesting as sources. They can be found in the newest extant edition by Reinhard Olt, K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald; Gedichte, Carl Winter Verlag, Heidelberg 1988.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ckzb6t/on_beards_and_table_manners_c_1340/", "created_utc": 1714937512.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ckzb6t/on_beards_and_table_manners_c_1340/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Wow, I love this, thank you for finding it!!", "This is a delight!

Then lay it into a bowl or platter and  take the mixed spices as is described after this: 8 lot of ginger, 4 lott of pepper, 4 lot of nutmeg, 4 lott of cloves, 3 lot of cinnamon, pound all of that together and add a third part (dryttel) of salt, that makes eight and a half lott,  this is proper with all pastries that are served hot. Now put as much  of that spice on the capon as it requires and sprinkle it well with this  spice between the wings and elsewhere, wherever it needs it. Then put  it into the pot and lay in 4 long slices of fresh bacon and another 4  slices lay on it (on the bottom and top?). If you have no bacon, use  fat. Then put a top crust on it and put it into an oven or tart pan and  stay with it until it rises (auff gatt). When it has risen,  poke a hole in it or the heat will break it open. Then let it bake for  another 2 hours, and when you want to put in liquid, take one egg and  some verjuice, beat it well together, and pour it in at the small hole  before it is fully baked. Then put it back into the oven and leave it in  another good hour, that is proper. Brush the pastry with egg before you  bake it.***\n\n***60 If you want to make a capon pastry***\n\n***Make the pastry crust as you know and take the capon and  clean it well. Parboil it a little, but not long. Then take it and chop  off its neck and its feet. If you want, carve it up, but not all the way  through, and season it well with pepper, ginger, not much mace, and a  little cloves and cinnamon. Put it into the pastry crust together with  the neck and the feet, and add the yolks of hard-boiled eggs and  raisins. Take capon fat or marrow and also put it in, and put the  leftover spices on top. Add sugar, and do not forget the salt. Close it  and let it bake slowly, and brush it well with egg all around.***\n\n***61 If you want to make a capon or chicken pastry with herbs***\n\n***Take the capons or chickens, chop up their wings, put  them in water and let them boil up. Chop up the fat of ox kidneys or  their marrow and chop all kinds of good herbs with that. Spice it well  with pepper, ginger, cinnamon, and raisins and sugar. Take the capons or  chickens, put them into the pastry crust, place the abovementioned on  top and the sides until it is full (?bys hin nein kunptt). Close it with a top crust and put it into the tart pan. When it is half baked, add verjuice to broth suitable for soup (suben brye) or use wine, make a hole in the lid, and pour in the broth. Brush it well with egg and let it bake fully.***\n\n***62 To make pigeon or chicken pastry***\n\n***You shall not carve them up (?erlegen) like the  capons, but crush their backs, wings, and feet. Otherwise, you treat  them as described above with regard to spices and larding (steck),  but without the bacon if you wish, as is also described of those  pastries. These pastries must not bake too long, only about three and a  half hours. You can also add liquid with an egg and verjuice. Let it  boil well in there. If you have no verjuice, use wine that is sour.***\n\nThese recipes follow directly after the [instruction for making pastry crust](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/23/two-more-pastry-crust-recipes/),  so the remark \u201cas you know\u201d is less despair-inducing than it usually  is. Beyond that, they are also quite interesting in culinary terms. The  proportions of spices and salt given in #59 even suggest a kind of  standard meat pastry spice mix as well as telling us this recipe is  meant to be served hot. Not all meat pastries were, and some were meant  specifically to preserve meat and/or make it portable. \n\nThe idea of pre-carving the bird in recipe #59 also shows a sense of  practicality, making it possible for diners to take ready portions out  of a pastry without needing to saw at the bird in its inconvenient dough  shell. The flavour is probably undistinguished, a lot of spices with a  touch of sourness, but certainly not unpleasant. Recipe #60 adds sugar,  egg yolks, and raisins for a fashionably sweet note, but we found it  adapted well to our palates. I am curious to play with #61 with its  undefined herbs and unspecified amount of sugar. It could be meant as a  slightly sweetened, strongly aromatic chicken pie or something more  reminiscent of cough drops, as this source [often combines herbs with sugar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/07/herb-tart-with-lots-of-sage/). \n\nThe shift from capon to capon or chicken to chicken or pigeon from  recipes #59 to 62 is interesting, but not surprising. It locates the  recipes in the domestic sphere \u2013 chickens and pigeons were kept by many  wealthy householders \u2013 and suggests that capons were more luxurious,  which they were. For any serious reconstruction it is safe to assume  that capons would have matched modern broiling chickens in terms of fat  and tenderness while chicken was more like soup birds. \n\nFinally, it should be said that the cooking times given are very  unlikely to be anywhere near accurate. I suspect they are estimates  since  even at a lower temperature than modern ovens usually have, they  seem quite excessive. I will give it a try at some point. Four to five  hours at a modest 150\u00b0C seem unlikely to improve a single chicken, but I  have been surprised before. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of  Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The  recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely  produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg.

For me, it was  an opportunity to try out a few recipes for an appreciative audience.  Most were taken from the collection of Philippine Welser, and all were  broadly successful, though they will need further fine-tuning.   \n\n \n\n[ Left to right: grape juice tart, tart of chopped apples, venison pastry \\(beef, actually\\), capon pastry, sage tart, and raisin marzipan \u201cpears\u201d.  ](https://preview.redd.it/hr5k3noclcqc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51048f22dcc6851675939ca632e7bfb5ccef2a7a)\n\nI will try to address what I learned and how it turened out overt the  coming days, but today I will have to limit myself to one. The grape  juice tart that made me so curious turned out to work after all. [The recipe says](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/20/grape-juice-tart/):\n\n***56 To make a wine tart of grapes (*****wein draubenn*****)***\n\n***Take the berries of the grapes and a little flour, melted  butter, sugar, and cinnamon. Press it through (a sieve) together and  put it in a pan. Let it boil until it turns thick, put it into a tart  and let it bake a quarter of an hour. When you think it has had enough  and it is turning nicely brown, take it out and let it cool. Then  sprinkle it with sugar and cinnamon and serve it.***\n\nThis is an interesting take, and I wondered whether it might set like  a jelly or be reduced like a syrup before being baked. To start  experimenting, I opted for a simple combination: storebought grape  juice, butter, sugar, cinnamon, and white flour. Depending on how fine  the sieve was and how much force was used in straining, the original mix  may well have been a great deal thicker, more like fruit pulp, and I  think I will try passing some grapes through a  foodmill in season for  comparison. \n\nToday, I mixed about half a litre of red grape juice with about a  tablespoon of melted butter, two tablespoons of sugar, a teaspoon of  cinnamon, and two tablespoons of Typ 550 flour first stirred into a  paste with some of the juice to make sure no lumps formed. This was to  test the idea that the flour was the needed thickening agent, and it  worked quite well. The liquid thickened as soon as it boiled and quickly  started coating the pan so I needed to take it off the stove to stop it  from burning. It did not reduce much. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c8lguyflcqc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=def5b037f1b20d8456ad0c467499c7f844c9a2d3\n\nPoured into a small pie shell based on the[ tart crust recipe in the same collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/23/two-more-pastry-crust-recipes/),  it went into the oven at a medium heat and baked until it bubbled and  started browning. With the dark colour of the grape juice, the colour  change was hard to observe. The filling was still quite liquid when it  came out, but set further as it cooled. However, it leaked and spread  out as we cut the tart to serve it.  \n\nI think the first thing I will do when I try it next time is use  white grapes, and a more pulpy mix. The tart base also might benefit  from a \u2018shorter\u2019 and more absorbent crust, though this one held the  liquid well and tasted quite good. Also, this may actually work better  with small, portion-sized tarts than with one large one. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

This could be read as a  substitute for the roast milk dishes (coagulated or otherwise thickened  milk skewered and roasted) we find in a number of places, [including earlier in this manuscript](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/14/another-roast-milk-recipe/), but it is not a terribly convincing one. It rather looks like a richer and more elaborate version of[ roast millet porridge](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/03/a-lenten-feast-in-2021/). There is a parallel in the [Buoch von Guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise)  again (#47) which is titled simply \u201ca dish\u201d but ends with the  instruction \u201cserve it in lieu of roast milk\u201d. Clearly, the similarity  was seen.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

Season all four colours. The white is made of almonds or nuts. Pass them  through, and boil each colour separately and add a little wine, but not  to the white. When they gel (*****ger\u00fcn*****) and you wish to serve them, rub a serving bowl with honey, and let the jelly (*****sultz*****) harden (*****uberslahen*****) so it does not run together.***\n\nThis is a lovely example for how medieval cooks played with colour.  In this case, it is apoplied to jelly, a fashionable food that may have  been quite a novelty still at the time. The process of extracting  gelatin from bones and connective tissues is described here, which  clarifies the meaning of *sultz* in this case. That word, a cognate of S\u00fclze and related to Salz and Latin *salsa*,  could still refer to either a bread-thickened, spicy sauce or to a  gelatin and sometimes to a cross between the two, which may be the  origin of the jelly. \n\nThe colouring agents are not surprising: Green is produced with  parsley juice, black with dark toasted bread or tart cherries,  presumably their juice or [a preserve](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/), yellow with saffron, and white with almond milk. These are common colourants at the time and recur in other recipes. \n\nWe are not told how to serve the jelly, but the instructions to  spread honey on the serving bowl and the reference to jelly running  together (always a risk with imperfect quality control and no artificial  refrigeration) suggest that it was cut into shapes and arranged on the  bowl, possibly in a pleasing pattern. A [similar recipe from the K\u00f6nigsberg MS imitates a chessboard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/24/chequered-jelly-from-the-konigsberg-ms/).  \n\nThis is still a long way from the jellies of the Renaissance both in  terms of flavour \u2013 it cannot have been terribly attractive compared to  the [sweetened wine concoctions of de Rontzier](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/01/galantine-jelly-recipes-from-de-rontzier/) \u2013 and its [architectural ambition](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/09/multicoloured-jelly-from-de-rontzier/).  But it represents the  beginning of a grand tradition and an  established medieval habit of conspicuous display: If you could not make  your food interesting in terms of taste, you could still make it  colourful. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

Anna Wecker writes specifically that it should be bought from  apothecaries, but here we get instructions for making it ourselves.

Of course, both recipe collections were  produced in Augsburg in the 1550s, so similar terminology and  preparations are not surprising.

He is thus overshadowed by the twin peaks of Marx Rumpolt and  Anna Wecker. What makes his work interesting is the way in which he  systematically lists versions of a class of dishes, illustrating the  breadth or a court cook\u2019s repertoire. He is also more modernly  fashionable than Rumpolt.

The result, I  suspect, will be used as a heavy syrup rather than dry sugar, though it  could of course be cooked down and dried out again.

The finished dish very likely would have looked  like piped crullers or round churros. The rise a good choux pastry \u2013  known in German today as *Brandteig* or *Br\u00fchteig*, cognate of the *pruete kuechlein* mentioned here \u2013 produces likely obliterated any surface detail on the finished fritter.

Kitchen  syringes are found in antique stores and flea markets all over Germany,  most of them not suitable for any kind of firefighting, though  twentieth-century cooks tended to favour meat grinders (*Fleischwolf*)  for the purpose.

Take two eggs, beat them in fat, pour  in cold water, as much as there is egg, pour the eggs into the flour  and stir it like a porridge. Do not let it boil too long, and also do  not fry (*****brenne*****) the flour too strongly (*****hart*****).***\n\nThis recipe is for a strengthening, soft food that can be served to a  women who has just given birth, much as Joseph is preparing in the  altarpiece above. Recipes specific to Kindbetterinnen are fairly  frequently found in the medicinal recipe collections of the time and  sometimes outside of them.  They usually involve much the same  ingredients as dishes served to the sick: eggs, wine, light meat or  poultry, sugar, white bread, and butter. \n\nThough the recipe itself is likely not complex, it involves a good  deal of shorthand and goes-without-saying which makes it difficult to  interpret. First, we have bread, probably grated, that is fried in fat.  This is typical for bread porridges of the time. Next, there is a  notably precise instruction to combine two parts fat to one part flour  which looks like a roux, especially as we are cautioned at the end not  to *brenne* it too hard. *Brennen* or *einbrennen* was  the contemporary term for roux and is still used in German dialects.  However, the next step of stirring two eggs \u2018in fat\u2019 with an equal  amount of cold water is somewhat unclear. I do not think the eggs are  meant to be fried, but rather stirred with melted lard or butter,  something we find every now and then in other recipes. The whole is then  added to the flour which would produce something like a roux custard,  though it is hard to see how to stop the egg from curdling. It is not  quite clear what happens with the bread. \n\nIf I had the time to reconstruct this, I would begin with fried  grated bread that is reserved for the final stage. Then I would produce a  light roux and quench it with a mixture of egg and water, beating  continually to try and prevent curdling. once the egg mixture has  cooked, I would add the bread to let it soak though and give body and  aroma to the whole. It might turn out palatable. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

I am not sure why one would not simply boil rice in almond  milk, but it must have been attractive to people at the time. Similar  dishes are referred to as almond porridge ([Mandelmus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/03/almond-milk-rice-pudding-from-the-inntalkochbuch/))  in other contexts. The combination of rice and almonds also shows up in  different contexts, not least in this piece of decorative cookery:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A hedgehog shaped from almond-sugar mass with spikes made of almond slivers and raisins for eyes](https://preview.redd.it/8wkalq0yfc1a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf8e7bbb1057eb460d009db179170327965ff15)\n\n ***11 Hedgehog Milk (*****Ein Igel milch*****)***\n\n**Item take rice and boil it in thick milk or in almond milk.

Shape it artfully (*****gestaltlich*****) and pour milk on it so that the hedgehog stands in liquid (*****in eim pruelein*****). Thus it is a hedgehog.**\n\nHedgehogs of all kinds feature prominently in fifteenth-century  recipe collections, and though 1559 is a little late, there is nothing  surprising about this recipe.

{"title": "Cooking Calfskin (15th c.)", "selftext": "Just a short entry for today. This is from the Dorotheenkloster MS again:\n\n***161 A good dish of calf skin***\n\n***Take the skin of a calf, wash it well and prepare it cleanly. Cut it into small pieces. Season it with saffron and good spices and with parsley.***\n\nThis is really barely a recipe, just a few notes, and it leaves out the most important step, but it is also very interesting and opens up avenues of speculation. Skin is not commonly eaten in Europe today, so it is tempting to dismiss this as a sort of makeshift, a famine food, but it is pretty clearly not that. Anyone who could afford saffron and spices could also pay for proper meat and wanted to eat the skin in this instance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n92ggksvcqne1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdea95033001772f789bd6f13e041f88fe78da90\n\nYou can eat cooked animal skin. Cowskin is even considered a [delicacy in parts of West Africa](https://www.chefadora.com/omalicha/peppered-kpomo-cowskin-xs4jmwtkhs). The reason why Europeans did not usually eat the skin of the cattle they consumed was not that they tasted bad, but that they were needed more urgently to make parchment, rawhide, and leather. Keeping the people of the continent in shoes alone required vast quantities.\n\nHere, someone is making the conscious choice to keep and cook a calfskin rather than pass it on to a tanner or parchment maker. It may be a way of displaying status \u2013 this household has no need to monetise the (already expensive) calf efficiently \u2013 or a local tradition preserved in writing. It is certainly interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, the recipe doesn\u2019t record what is actually done with the skin. Cleaning is specifically mentioned, and that is [an important step with all skins](https://kitchenbun.com/how-to-prepare-cow-skin-cooking-cleaning-tips/). Laborious defleshing, removing the hair, and cleaning precede any cooking. What happens next is a mystery, though. I would speculate that the skin pieces are simmered for a long time to soften them before they are further processed.\n\nOnce softened, the skin pieces might have been fried, producing crispy, spicy bites with a chewy centre. We can easily imagine a dish full of them speckled with green flecks of parsley. Serving them in a thickened sauce, a spicy cooking liquid, or an aspic is really equally probable, though. We simply do not know.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1j7hw0x/cooking_calfskin_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741554915.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1j7hw0x/cooking_calfskin_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Thank you.

{"title": "Piped Fish Fritters (15th  c.)", "selftext": "This is an interesting and slightly disturbing recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS. [Piped fritters, rather like churros](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/20/piped-fritters-2/), are not uncommon, but making them of fish is:\n\n***146 Again a gm\u00fcs of pike***\n\n***Scale a pike, remove the bones, chop it, and pound it in a mortar. Add flour and yeast, pepper and salt. Knead it all together into a dumpling (close). Lay it into a pot that has a hole in the bottom the size of a finger and force the dumpling through it into a pan that has boiling oil or fat in it. Fry it well in that and serve it.***\n\nOnce again, we find a parallel in Meister Hans:\n\n***#151 Again to prepare fish in the shape of eels***\n\n***Item take and scale a pike and chop it to pieces, and remove its bones, or the fine flesh (praten) first, and pound it in a mortar. Add to it flour, honey and salt. Mix this and place it in a pot that has a hole as big as a finger. Force the fish through this into a vessel with boiling oil. Give it the shape of an eel, and fry it well. Serve it forth.***\n\nThis is clearly originally the same recipe, though it changed in transmission. The different name highlights the tendency of the Dorotheenkloster MS to name just about any dish a *gm\u00fcs*. In Middle High German, the word does get used in the sense of \u2018cooked dish\u2019 occasionally, and that may go some way towards explaining the widespread misconception that all medieval food was cooked to a mush. Certainly this is no *Mus* nor *Gem\u00fcse* in the modern sense.\n\nThe second salient difference between the two is in the ingredients. Meister Hans prescribes honey and salt while the Dorotheenkloster MS adds salt, pepper, and yeast (*hefen*). This may well be a transcription error, but it is hard to see what word could be mistaken for it. If it really is yeast, it suggests that flour made up a significant part of the dough. Otherwise, there would be no leavening effect.\n\nThe proportion of ingredients is, again, the stumbling block in reconstructing this dish. Is it a fish paste held together with a little flour, or a flour dough using fish to flavour and moisten it? As long as we don\u2019t know what we are supposed to aim for, we can only try out variations. I tried to produce the version in Meister Hans, made with honey and salt and consisting mainly of ground raw fish. The experience taught me that while this is feasible and holds together well, it needs to be cooked gently at a low temperature or the honey will burn and the result look like \u2013 not an eel.\n\n[What happens when the oil is too hot. It doesn't look a lot like eels.](https://preview.redd.it/kao4lebb2rke1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23820f8f8542b99270335ad463ef1eff0a8d1dc5)\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Boil it and add enough spices. Colour it with violet flowers. Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nUsing flowers to colour foods is not unexpected in medieval cuisine. Many showy recipes depended on specific colours, with blue typically derived from cornflowers. Violets are not as common, and given the wide variety of that family, it is hard to be sure which species of *Viola* is meant by *veyal* or *veyerl*. The first recipe is much what stereotype suggests, showy white almond milk and rivce flour forming the base for an extraneous colour.\n\nThe addition of boiled morels to the second is striking in its incongruity, not just by modern standards, but also in comparison to most medieval recipes. Not because of the ingredients as such \u2013 morels show up with reasonable frequency, usually cooked whole and filled with some stuffing \u2013 but in their combination. It would suggest some kind of scribal error \u2013 recipes that blend into each other without warning do crop up every now and then \u2013 but the text looks too coherent for that. I guess it really was meant that way. Thoroughly parboiling the morels should take care of their toxins and pressing them out would reduce both the water content that could dilute the almond milk and the risk of them \u2018bleeding\u2019 colour. Lying in a violet sauce of almond milk, they must certainly have looked striking.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

That way you can well (cook) a mues.***\n\nStockfish was a common food on fast days, often more readily available than expensive fresh fish, and is [mentioned in many recipe collections](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=stockfish). It was not universally popular and is often considered a lesser option, food fit for servants. The lengthy process of softening it in several [changes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/08/stockfish-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) of [water ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/27/roast-battered-stockfish/)[or ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/10/stockfish-pastry/)[even ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/02/rumpolt-on-cooking-plateissen/)[in ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/13/stockfish-from-the-oeconomia/)[lye ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/11/preparing-dried-fish-after-the-oeconomia/)was challenging, and the result not to everyone\u2019s liking. The Dorotheenkloster MS, though, shows genuine relish at the possibilities.\n\nThe first recipe is particularly interesting: once softened, the fish has its skin removed and is carefully debones and cut in pieces \u2013 one side left entire, the other cut up in chunks small enough to fit a cookpot. The instructions to leave the skin in one piece and to see the stomach is undamaged are rather strange. The first serves no visible purpose and the second is clearly impossible \u2013 stockfish were gutted before drying and their stomachs never reached Germany. Both are also found in [recipes for filled fish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/14/another-filled-pike/). They make sense when the flesh of fresh fish is turned into a stuffing and sewn back into the skin and the stomach used to make a kind of sausage. I suspect some kind of interpolation took place.\n\nStill, the stockfish is treated much like fresh fish. After parboiling, it is sliced thin, floured, and fried. I wonder how common this treatment was, despite the fact that we do not often find it described. They are served in a black pepper sauce \u2013 a spicy, thickened sauce where \u2018black\u2019 usually referred to it being prepared with blood.\n\nThe following recipes seem more commonplace.

Grind those (ingredients) together. Drain the beans. Pour on the ground, boiled ingredients (i.e. the sauce). Serve it.***\n\n***107 Also make green peas this way***\n\n***108 Of hard beans (read pon for buttern) and when you want to make butter from it***\n\n***Make dried (gedigen) beans this way: Put them into boiling lye until the shells come off, and pour them out on a sieve or a colander (?reitt). Rub off their shells. Boil them with the above seasoning and serve them. You can make butter from those beans.***\n\nBeans were a very common food in the fifteenth century. These were, of course, broad beans (Vicia faba), not the more popular phaseolus beans which are New World cultivars. Here, interestingly, though not surprisingly, there is a recipe for fresh beans and one for dried. Both are served with the same sour sauce of vinegar, beer, and *kumel*, which at this point could mean either cumin or caraway. Given the simplicity of the recipe (except for the rather random addition of saffron), I suspect caraway in this case, but that is purely conjectural.\n\nThe recipe for fresh beans has a [close parallel](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/19/beans-in-a-pfeffer-sauce/) in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf), also from Austria. Both are paralleled in Meister Hans, and I am increasingly convinced that the original of that text is significantly earlier than 1460, possibly even 1400.\n\n***97 Of beans***\n\n***Item boil green beans with nice (=white) bread, pepper, three times as much caraway (or cumin?), saffron, salt, vinegar and beer. Grind it together. Dry the (cooked) beans, pour the boiled-up cooked (sauce) over them and serve it. Also cook green peas like this.***\n\n***98 Of hard beans***\n\n***Item of hard beans, make them thus: put them into boiling lye until their shells come off. Then pour them into a sieve and rub the shells off them. Boil them with the aforementioned wine sauce and serve it. (From) these beans, you can (also) make bean butter.***\n\nNote the second recipe now mentions a wine sauce though wine is not included in the sauce described earlier. This is probably a transmission error, just as the repetition of \u2018butter\u2019 in the Dorotheenkloster MS likely is a scribal error. Other than that, these recipes are not just functionally the same thing, they are practically identical.\n\nAs to its culinary qualities, I actually [made this for a crafting meeting of my medieval club](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/25/a-meatless-recipe-testing-session/) last February and rather enjoyed it. Using a modern beer makes it more bitter than it would have been using a medieval brew, but the combination of spiciness, acidity, and fresh beans in a creamy bread-thickened sauce is attractive as a side dish.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Topanitz - A Mystery Dish (15th c.)", "selftext": "This recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS is not very clear, but very interesting liguistically:\n\n***94 What topanitz you should make with the morels***\n\n***The topanitz. Take cinnamon and boil it well, and strain it through as sieve. Add butter and saffron and put toasted semeln bread on top (bestrewe). You can also make a topanitz from peas. But with that, you must use saffron and caraway (or cumin, kumel)***\n\nThis is the kind of recipe where you really wish for a parallel somewhere to clarify what on earth it means. Alas, no such luck yet. The name at least is a possible lead: [Topanitz is a Slovene word and later describes a dish of toasted bread](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336708681_Deutsch-slowenische_Wechselbeziehungen_in_der_Sprache_der_traditionellen_Karntner_Kuche). but there seems to be no living tradition of making it.\n\nThis recipe can be read as a dish of that kind: Cinnamon is boiled in water to extract its aroma, then discarded and the water used to produce a sauce for toasted white bread slices. It is hard to see how that can be reconciled with the verb *bestrewe*, though. It usually means sprinkle with a powder, so it suggests the bread would be crumbled. That would make something closer to a porridge and explain how the same dish can also be made with peas. Alternatively \u2013 because medieval recipes can be like that \u2013 the peas could be meant as an alternative basis for the broth. Pea broth is a common ingredient in Lenten foods.\n\nThe morels that this is meant to be served with are not much clearer. The subsequent recipe is indeed for morels, or at least its title says that it is. The text itself never mentions them and it\u2019s not a lot easier to interpret.

And you must strain (pass) it through a cloth. You must have a container (tegel) for each preparation (mues) and each one must have three holes. (Put) the white into one container separately and the yolk into one separately. Now you must have a \u201csmall rake\u201d (rechel) for each container so that you can rub it through. You must press it so that the worms (expressed through the holes) become as long as your serving dish is wide. Now move once away from you and once towards you, and (lift the container) up. Now take the white container and move it crosswise across them for the (entire) length. And now the one with the yellow in it, move it across and back, and then take the white again, and after the white, the yellow, as long as you have of each.***\n\nIn terms of taste, this does not sound terribly appealing. It\u2019s mashed hard-boiled eggs with a little flour and sugar. You can probably taste the saffron in this dish since there is so little else to flavour it.

In place of the minced meat topping, we have mortared fish roe and the rather mysterious boiled raisins and party coloured almonds are added as a topping. The base would simply be the standard kind of dough used to make meat fladen, but since we do not really know what that was, we can [use our imagination](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/07/25/a-meat-fladen-experiment/).\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Almond Starch Pudding (15th c.)", "selftext": "At least I think that\u2019s what it is. Anyway, in the middle of the Dorotheenkloster MS, we encounter a sentence that clearly belongs at the beginning of a collection. This is followed by a number of recipes for what we would call puddings and jellies. This is the first:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/emsu0ijm81ae1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc9da233a3ddfa2d3772204853201bc9b175e783\n\n***Here begins a record (geticht) of many kinds of dishes. You will find written down hereafter how to prepare them in a courtly fashion (hofleich).***\n\n***32 Of all kinds of Mus dishes (gemuesen)***\n\n***If you want to make an almond mues, take half a pound (talentum) of almonds and starch (umerdum) with it. If you do not have that, take semmel bread for it. Put that in water and press it out thoroughly. Pass it through a cloth with the milk, that way it turns out nicely small. If you want it sweet, add sugar. This is called almond mues.***\n\nThis is recipe is neither very surprising nor terribly attractive, but its use of starch is interesting. It is called a *Mus*, a word that can describe any food thin enough to be eaten with a spoon, but not liquid. The basic flavour profile is \u201cwhite\u201d, that is, as neutral and mild as possible. It is very much a courtly dish, using expensive ingredients to produce a decorative effect.\n\nI cannot be completely sure, but looking at parallel recipes in the section I assume the half pound of almonds mentioned at the beginning is used to make almond milk. That would be the \u2018milk\u2019 mentioned later. The dish is made with starch, presumably cooked and allowed to set. This is much like what English calls a (corn-)starch pudding and in German is simply known as *Pudding*. The word for starch, *umerdum*, is of course related to *amydon*. It\u2019s an unusual term, but so is the use of *talentum* for a unit of weight, presumably a pound.\n\nThere are a [large number of recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/01/all-the-almond-cheeses/) for similar [almond milk dishes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/27/almond-dishes/) thickened in a variety of ways. This one fits the pattern well. The texture would have been unusual and attractive compared to dishes thickened with flour or bread, but that did not set it apart enough to consider it special. It is basically another Mandelmus.\n\nThat is all for today.

When it is almost roasted, drizzle it with hot fat. When it is fully roasted, take bitter oranges and press out their juice. And when you want to take it off the spit, cut off the string, lay it in a bowl, and pour the orange juice over it.***\n\nThis recipe, while fashionable and luxurious, sounds much more interesting in culinary terms than the endless iterations of fish cooked in wine. A filling of walnuts, juniper, and sharp spices makes an interesting addition to eel and the fruity tartness of the juice sounds like a lovely contrast. I wonder how necessary it is to add fat to the eel \u2013 they are usually quite oily \u2013 but if it is roasted over a strong fire, it may simply be to prevent the skin from charring or drying out too much. Bitter oranges imported from Italy [came into fashion in Germany from the late 15th century on](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/21/bitter-orange-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) and were quite popular in upper-class cuisine.\n\nIt is not quite clear what the phrase *ain stuck nach dem andern her auser* means, since the recipe does not mention cutting the eel into pieces. I think it could be instructions to wash the eel carefully, bit by bit, but that is really just speculation. Perhaps everybody just knew the dish was made in portion-sized pieces so it did not need pointing out. However, missing out on the potential for spectacle of serving an entire filled eel would be out of character for Renaissance cooks.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Using bundles of herbs to brush it will add to the falvour if the spicing is done carefully, as is most likely intended.

These were typically fried dumplings (though we have recipes where they are baked or boiled) that featured a filling wrapped in dough (though some recipes called *krapfen* do not have a wrapping). With eight eggs used to make the filling for fifteen krapfen, these are quite substantial pieces, not so much ravioli-sized as almost hand pies.

Then roll it as thin as you possibly can and fold the rolled-out dough on itself 8 times. Cut it as small as you can and put a little (of it?) into a pan. Pour hot fat over it and and press it together well, and fry it hot. That way it is pretty and curly (krau\u00df). Sprinkle sugar on it when you serve it.***\n\nThe very title of the recipe, a gefresch, had me briefly stumped. It certainly did not seem to be related to words like \u2018frisch\u2019 or \u2018resch\u2019, or at least it would be hard to get either to fit with something fitted around a tart. But then I remembered [a recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/06/fried-stars-and-dagging/) from the [15th-century Innsbruck MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Innsbrucker-Rezeptbuch.pdf):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra2n3h31gd8d1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d2fa6673a79e6f36b01dd9e63b05c365807398b\n\n***109 If you would prepare a fritter that looks like cut dagging (gesniten fronsen), also make sheets of dough and cut them and roll them out on top of each other. Fry them in fat that is not too hot and press them together at the top before you put them into the fat etc.***\n\nA *gefrens*, a word used to describe such a dagged or fringed edge in cloth, would make a reasonable misspelling of *gefresch*, and the recipe is similar enough to make this plausible. The laster recipe looks to be finer and fiddlier, with eight layers and very fine dagging cut, and I wonder how far you could take this. Certainly, the idea of fittting such a fringe around the edge of a tart, possibly fried in one piece and lifted out of the pan with extreme care and skill, sounds like exactly the thing to impress a demanding guest.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8u4et33gd8d1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f072e117f4790a61cad2fcf3304c0cf78626b31\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Open up the fish and scale it as is described above for one that is whole (recipe 79) and lay it into the scherben. Season it in proper measure as is described above for the kind cooked in pastry and lay in 3 or 4 lumps of good fat. Then take a little roux (brentzs mel, literally \u2018burned flour\u2019) and a little spices, also the yolk of an egg and a little verjuice or white wine, stir it together and pour it into the bottom of the scherben. Cover it again and set it in the oven. Let it bake for two hours, according to how large the fish is. Turn it over every quarter hour, season it and set it back in the oven, that way it will turn out proper.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe, but its interpretation hangs on several words that are not entirely clear. First off a *scherben* is a pottery vessel, typically wider than it is tall. This one has legs and a lid. We find pottery pans like this in the archeological record, so I assume that is something like what is envisioned here. Today, of course, there are dedicated pottery fish pots.\n\nThe recipe refers back to previous instances to guide us in preparing and seasoning the fish. The preparation \u2013 sliced along the sides to help cooking, seasoning, and portioning \u2013 is described in[ recipe #79](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/07/carp-in-pastry/), the seasoning of ginger, pepper, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon in [recipe #59](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/10/capon-pastries/). Again, this shows that the manuscript was designed as a whole.\n\nThe most speculative part is the reconstruction of what I think is a roux sauce. The words *brentzs mel*, [literally \u2018burned flour\u2019](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/02/honey-sauce-for-fish-from-cgm-384-ii/), are used to describe browning flour in fat which is then turned into a sauce by adding liquids and spices. The modern German word is *Einbrenne*. We know the [process was understood](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/07/lying-in-porridge/) [significantly earlier](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/06/kuchenmaistrey-in-print-and-pea-patties/), so it would not be a surprise to find it here. The description is sufficiently cursory to not be sure, though. I read this as making a roux sauce with verjuice or wine, egg yolk, and spices that is added to the fish before it is baked to impart its flavour and integrate the cooking juices.\n\nIt may be worth trying come winter, too.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

It is based on [a passage](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/21/legumes-according-to-constantinus-africanus/) in [Isaac Iudaeus *de diaetis*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Excerpts-from-Isaac-Iudaeus-de-diaetis.pdf) in the translation of Constantinus Africanus:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adczfj6lgbsc1.jpg?width=293&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f3afe1f6e6a748f3472b2be73aae096dfa0b94a\n\n***(\u2026) Some cook them (beans) in water, and some roast them  by the fire. Those (beans) that are cooked in water are more laudable  because the water takes much windiness and grossness away from them,  especially if the first water is thrown away and other water  substituted. And two ways also apply here: either they are cooked with  their shells or without them. Those that are cooked in water with their  shell are hard to digest and windy (\u2026) Those cooked without their shells  are less windy and faster to digest. And if a sauce is made for them  with some heating ingredients (such as long pepper, ginger, and almond  oil) it is the perfect medicine for the act of coition. They are  sometimes also eaten with mint, oregano, cumin and similar ingredients  which diminish their windiness and inflation even more. Those that are  roasted by the fire have less windiness, and they are very hard to  digest except is they are soaked in water after roasting and eaten with  cumin, mint and oregano. \u2026***\n\nBoiling beans is nothing new, obviously, but roasting them by the  fire intrigued me. It sounded a lot like the crunchy toasted chickpeas  so popular today. I decided to give this a try and provide some snack  food to the weavers and seamstresses upstairs. \n\nOf course this is not the season for fresh beans, so I had to take  recourse to dried ones. Even so, fava beans \u2013 the only kind available in  Europe in the 11th century \u2013 are not easy to find here. A Turkish  grocer eventually provided a bag. I steeped them in warm water  overnight, shelled them, and laid the kernels out on a baking sheet to  roast. I also added some chickpeas to gauge the process and have  something that would be palatable even if it failed.\n\nThough the idea would have been interesting, I decided against the  sauce of ginger, long pepper, and almond oil. Instead, I liberally  sprinkled the beans with cumin, oregano, mint, and salt and drizzled  them with olive oil before putting them, in a convection oven at 200\u00b0C.  The result was quite excellent, though some were very hard. I am fairly  sure they would still have been good soaked in water, but eaten crisp  and warm, they were too tasty to try that. \n\nIsaac Iudaeus de diaetis universalibus et particularibus, originally  written in Arabic in the late ninth or early tenth century, was  translated and adapted by Constantinus Africanus in the late 11th  century and circulated widely in Italy and beyond soon afterwards.  While the original applies to a different context, it is still  reasonable to use it as a guide to the advice that Siculo-Normans would  have found useful. It is an open question how much the original was  altered in translation \u2013 I cannot say since I read no Arabic. However,  the extensive reference to eating pork suggests that some alterations  took place.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1bv1un7/toasted_beans_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1712172736.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1bv1un7/toasted_beans_11th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

And again, it is fruit tarts:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u80ipdsyzhc1.jpg?width=834&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=addfefe058bc92beefb5b2044f3619856cf83f58\n\n***28 If you want to make a pear tart***\n\n***Take 2 pounds of pears,*** **Regel birenn** ***(cooking  pears similar to wardens) or others that are good roasting pears. Let  them roast in the fire a little, but not much. Then put them in fresh  water and clean them well. Then grate them small and fry them in a  butter for a short time. Then put them in a bowl and add half a pound of  sugar, an ounce of cloves, an ounce of cinnamon, all pounded, and rose  water that smells nice. Further take eight eggs with it and add a little  salt. Stir it all together, make a tart base as for other tarts, and  bake it with little heat above and below.***\n\n***29 If you want to make a pear tart***\n\n***Take good pears and cut about 10 or 12 slices from them.  Turn them over in flour and then fry them a little. Let them cool and  lay them on the tart base, two layers, then strew sugar, cinnamon, and a  little ginger on it. You an also not put a top crust on it if you wish.  Let it bake nicely, and before you serve it, let it brown (yber schlagenn) and then strew sugar on it.***\n\n***30 If you want to make a pear tart***\n\n***Take pears and cut slices from them, fry (schwem)  them in hot fat, take them out and let them cool. Lay them on a tart  base close to each other, and if you think it is too thin, put another  layer on top. Put raisins on it, sugar, cinnamon, and a little ginger,  and make a cut top crust to go on top. Let it bake, and brush it with  egg before.***\n\n***31 If you want to make a pear tart***\n\n***Take good pears and cut 4 slices from them, and take the slices and cut small notches (? krmelin) into them, not all the way through, but one cut next to the other. Fry (schwem)  the pears in fat before so they turn nicely brown, then cut them and  lay them on the tart base one beside the other. Strew them with sugar,  cinnamon, and a little ginger, and let it bake gently.***\n\n***32 If you want to make a tart of chopped pears***\n\n***Take pears and chop them small. Take grated bread and fry  it in fat, add sugar and spices to the pears such as cinnamon and a  little ginger, and pour them into the fat and fry them. Stir them and  put them into a bowl, then put them on a tart base and let it bake  nicely.***\n\n***33 If you want to make a tart of pureed pears and quinces***\n\n***Take pears and a few quinces and steam them, and grind  them to a puree in a mortar. Then add sugar, cinnamon, and a little  ginger, and stir it well together. If the mass (der dayg) is  too thin, add a little grated bread until it is right. Then pour it on  the tart base and let it bake gently so it does not turn too hard,  otherwise it is not good.***\n\nThese are broadly very similar to the [apple tart variations](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/06/as-augsburgian-as-apple-pie/)  found earlier in the same collection., but there are a few interesting  points. Recipe #28 is noteworthy for providing quantities which we  usually lack. Two pounds of pears with eight egg whites and half a pound  of sugar give us an idea what size tart we are talking about at least,  and do not sound entirely implausible in proportion. I find the quantity  of spices difficult to imagine, though. While the ounce, like the  pound, could vary regionally, even a small version of around 26 grammes  seems far too much for a single tart. It may need trying out.\n\nRecipe #31  is interesting in its presentation. I am not entirely  certain, but the description suggests the quartered pears are sliced in a  hassleback style. Given the tart is then baked without a top crust, the  point might have been the decorative appearance as well as managing  cooking time. We still do this with some versions of apple cake.\n\nRecipe #33 combines pears and quinces in a filling, an interesting  approach and probably worth trying out. As with the apples in previous  recipes, the pears used here were not like the vsoft, juicy fruit we are  used to. Especially the *Regelbirne* identified by name in Recipe #28 was tart and firm, meant for cooking and suitable for long storage. We can still buy *Kochbirnen* in season sometimes that come close.\n\nBeyond that, we are again left with an impression of a limited  cuisine. For all the varieties listed \u2013 and taking up expensive paper \u2013  the basic approach seems very similar and the spicing rarely varies. It  is hard to see why it was necessary to write all of it down separately.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of  Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The  recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely  produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have  been made at the request of her mother and was written by an  experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine  Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near  Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der  Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1aoed55/pear_tarts_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1707675097.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1aoed55/pear_tarts_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Quite similar to some of the apple recipes you posted earlier.

{"title": "Cheese-Bacon Fritters", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/03/cheese-bacon-fritters/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/03/cheese-bacon-fritters/)\n\n Another recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch. The formula is plain, but the instructions are interesting:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yh4pcc5k554c1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c8b48b23dc3647c50bba9409ab488be3c475f84\n\n***143 Krapfen fried with a filling (*****s\u00e4ltz*****)***\n\n***A filling (*****saltz*****) for krapfen. Prepare a filling (*****f\u00fcll saltzen*****) with grated cheese and with eggs and also with chopped bacon, and spread (*****kleib*****) it on the (dough) sheet and (stick) the other part on top of it. Shape flat fritters (*****fladen*****) and fry them in fat. You can also fill the same fritters with eggs and with apples.***\n\nThe first thing to note is that the filling of the fritters is referred to as a *saltz* or *s\u00e4ltz*.  That word more usually means a sauce, and while it is not unknown to  use condiment sauces to fill fritters, this clearly is not one. Rather,  this usage reminds us that words like *saltz*, *sultz*, and (in this manuscript) *condiment* refer more to the function \u2013 adding flavour \u2013 than to the place or consistency. \n\nThe filling itself is straightforward: hard grated cheese, bacon, and  egg. The instruction to stick it to the bottom dough sheet suggests a  thick consistency, not liquid, but also not too chunky. The fritters  themselves are formed by putting the filling between a bottom and a top  sheet of dough, and I wonder whether they were produced in batches like  ravioli. The reference to *fladen* suggests they were round, and  while we cannot be sure of the size, I assume they were not very large.  Whenever we find a size mentioned, *krapfen* are bite- or  portion-sized.  So basically, we have fried round cheese-and-bacon  ravioli. This is probably not bad, especially in winter, and easy for  newcomers to medieval cuisine to enjoy. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set  of manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is  a note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements. It is edited  in Doris Aichholzer\u2019s \u201cWildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201d Drei  mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Edition, \u00dcbersetzung, Quellenkommentar,  Peter Lang, Berne et al. 1999", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/18a2qkv/cheesebacon_fritters/", "created_utc": 1701636034.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/18a2qkv/cheesebacon_fritters/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Sounds yummy!"]}
{"title": "A Renaissance Pie Workshop (with recipes)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/13/a-renaissance-pie-workshop/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/13/a-renaissance-pie-workshop/)\n\n There have not been any new recipes since Thursday, but there is a good  reason for that. This weekend, despite feeling somewhat under the  weather, I was able to teach a hands-on workshop in my medieval club.  The topic was \u2018[Pies and Pastries of Renaissance Germany](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pies-and-Tarts-Workshop-2023.pdf)\u2018, and we had a good deal of fun.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3bpdpkwu50c1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2232c9c92c6fd7ddbbd3de22ff4eaafda489e4fd\n\nI prepared a [handout ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pies-and-Tarts-Workshop-2023.pdf)including  recipe sources and modern adaptations of different crusts and fillings,  and we got to work in a small, but well equipped kitchen. Owing to  several people with severe allergies, we used neither nuts nor fish,  excluding two standard favourites: the [crawfish pie ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/27/crawfish-pastries-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)and the [almond tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/23/the-landsknecht-cookbook-booksigning-feast-iii/). Nonetheless, we enjoyed a wealth of options.\n\nOwing to time constraints, we used the same crust for all of our  pies: An enriched hot water crust from the recipe collection of Sabina  Welser. It combines flour, eggs, water and fat (in our case butter) into  a versatile, pliable dough and can be made quickly without needing a  refrigerator. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9ezlb91v50c1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96b2fea57657cf499c91914a2d2c6d036054a65d\n\n ***To make a pastry dough for all raised pastries***\n\n***Take flour, the best you can get, about two handfuls, or  depending on how large or small you want it, place it on the table, stir  in two eggs with a knife and salt it a little. Put water and an amount  of lard the size of two good eggs into a pan and let it melt together  and boil, then pour it onto the abovementioned flour on the table, make a  stiff dough and work it well as you see fit. In summer, you must use  meat broth instead of the water and fat ladled from the top of soups  instead of lard. When the dough is kneaded, roll it into a round ball  and stretch it out well forward with your fingers or with a rolling pin,  so that a rim remains, and then let it harden in the cold. Then shape  the dough in the measure I showed you and retain some dough for a cover,  roll it out and moisten it and the top of the the raised pastry with  water, then press it well together with your fingers. Leave a little  hole in one place, and when it is pressed together well and no openings  are left, blow into the little hole you left so the lid rises up nicely.  Then press it together immediately. Put it in the oven, but flour the  container beforehand and see that the oven is heated well, thus it will  be a good pastry. That is the way you make dough for raised pastries.***\n\n***(Sabina Welserin #61)***\n\nThough trying out [different techniques](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/19/baking-pastries-the-italian-way/)  would have been fun, I decided against it because it would have made  things too complicated. As with everything described here, instructions  are [in the handout paper](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pies-and-Tarts-Workshop-2023.pdf). \n\nOnce we had our dough, we got started on the fillings. It was cold  outside, so something rich and hearty, but meatless, was appreciated by  all, and I settled on the [Parmesan Osterfladen from Marx Rumpolt](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/04/parmesan-osterfladen/) (see last Saturday\u2019s post) . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ta4599b6v50c1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe9a0bcb791ebc3b9018a6fab152969e3bca23a5\n\nThe second savoury pie I introduced was the ubiquitous [green ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/21/italian-influence-in-the-innsbruck-ms/)[tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/06/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-i/).  We took the recipe from the Innsbruck MS as our basis, but could not  get chard and thus had to settle for spinach as our main green. \n\n***146 If you would prepare a tart (*****durden*****), take  chard and salt and parsley and cut it up small all together. Wash it in  fresh water, grate cheese into it, and add fat and eggs. Then prepare  sheets of dough and put it into there, and bake (*****pach** ***?) it in a pan and put egg yolk on top and let it bake well etc.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnugv7yav50c1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b05ee7931767ac0567cfafe568916aa42891ee6e\n\n It was still delicious. We also wanted something sweet, and it was  the tart of plums from Sabina Welser. We used dried prunes, boiled to a  mush in very little liquid and seasoned with cinnamon and sugar: \n\n***A pie of plums, be they dried or fresh***\n\n***Let them boil in wine before, pass them and take eggs,  cinnamon, and sugar. Let it bake. For the pie crust dough, you begin  thus: Take two eggs and beat them, then stir flour into it until it  turns thick. Then, turn it out onto a table and work it well until it  turn out right. Afterwards, take a little more than half the dough and  roll out a sheet as wide as you want your pie. Then pour the plums on  it, roll out a second sheet and cut it as you would have it. Put it on  the pie, pinch it well together and let it bake. This is how you make  all pie doughs.***\n\nWe used the hot-water crust rather than just eggs, and it turned out  very well. To modern sensibilities, it tastes Christmassy, and that felt  just right for a cold and wet November day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im8klqdgv50c1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e043960016b38ccea0fadca00a87656c1d322a56\n\n Finally, we had a meat dish, Anna Wecker\u2019s pastries of leftover meat: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/je7h26tjv50c1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1f1e67ef3a7b6ab381fdeac31be61b714518861\n\n ***Pastries of leftover meat***\n\n***Take of such (meat) as you have that is no longer  suitable for the table , it is good for these things. Cut the meat off  the bones and chop it well. Make a dough of fine flour and eggs, a  little fat, salt it well, or the way you make it for tarts, as you  please.***\n\n***Take two thin sheets, one as big as the other, shape it  as you would like it and as you can, round, triangular, or rectangular,  into hearts, roses, or stars. The add good spices to the meat, raisins,  and what you like to have sweet or sour, as you please. (Add) enough fat  from what is skimmed off soups (Suppenschmalz) or beef marrow,  according to how fat or lean the meat itself is. If you wish, you can  also add good herbs, with or without spices, or eggs as though you  wanted to make sausages that go into the fat-lined part of the large  intestine (Klobw\u00fcrste). You may also take coarsely ground almonds, (but)  they are better grated, especially if you also add eggs, and grate a  little bit of hard white bread if you please. Always add a little meat  broth.***\n\n***If you want to make them, prepare it (the meat) and put a  little of it on part of the abovementioned sheets (shaped) according to  whatever you want of animals, birds, hounds , hares, as described  above. Shape it with the prepared stuff (meat mixture) and then place  the second sheet on top. Press it together according to its shape and  close it as artfully as you can.***\n\n***Give each its form: to the sow, bristles with a pastry  wheel, give each one eyes from black dried cherries or juniper berries,  (arrange) the skin of an egg around it or of red apples or rose petals,  each after its kind. As to what else belongs to them, I have kept the  little sheep\u2019s trotters and such things as well as the young hares\u2019  feet, those who are artful do not need much description, to those who  aren\u2019t it is in vain. Roughly done does not improve them or detract from  them. Close them, brush them with egg as is always done, bake them  quickly and serve them warm. They are best without egg, but to each as  they like it. Almonds and a little bread makes them good.***\n\nThe book actually includes two versions of this recipoe, and the  basic idea is not so much a specific dish as a recycling approach: Meat,  enough fat, some dry iungredient, spices, raisins, and egg to hold it  all together. Our time limited us to fairly simple hand pies, though a  spirited attempt at pastry art was made with some. A longer session  might well have produced the kind of playful expression Wecker  envisions. \n\nIt was a good day, a fun class with active, interested participants,  and I wish I could do this more often. And in case you wish to try one  of these yourself, do not forget to [download the workshop handout](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pies-and-Tarts-Workshop-2023.pdf).

{"title": "U-Boat Cusine?", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/25/rabbit-hole-two-u-boat-cuisine/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/25/rabbit-hole-two-u-boat-cuisine/)\n\n Just a quick note since nothing may come of this in the end: The Technik-Museum in Speyer has [an actual submarine](https://speyer.technik-museum.de/de/u-boot-u9) you can visit. It\u2019s a[ type 205 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_205_submarine)West  German U-Boot built in the late 1960s for patrolling the Baltic, and  the interior has been restored to resemble its original state as much as  possible. Trying to imagine what it would be like living in there with  22 people for an extended period of time is difficult. The experience is  unsettling enough just passing through it as a visitor.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NCO galley - cook's berth on top left](https://preview.redd.it/w6pgwkbsz1eb1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e48095eb2259a53b31392dd4b269001a641570ac)\n\n Of course what interested me is the kitchen, sorry, galley. The Germans would call it *Komb\u00fcse*.  It\u2019s a tiny nook, not even standing height for me, with a three-burner  electric stove, a small oven, and a single sink. Just down the walkway  is the bridge, and across it lies the NCO mess.  \n\n \n\n[Stovetop and oven. The bridge is visible on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/ck26jiwvz1eb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8de160ebd7245a7a75e76cd608042a1886ef689)\n\nThe cook, an NCO, was expected to produce three meals a day plus  unlimited coffee for the crew as well as bake fresh bread daily while  the boat was at sea. It must have been quite challenging and very hard  work, and it fascinates me. This setup was designed by people who had  personal memories of submarine warfare in WWII and was considered  optimal and somewhat luxurious in the mid-1960s. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sink and refrigerator](https://preview.redd.it/grzr8mq102eb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26b098a39a47c7f8befc835065dfe240d291819f)\n\nI have contacted the U-Boot memorial and the navy museum in  Wilhelmshaven, and apparently there are no surviving recipes or  instructions for cooking on submarines. It surprises me a little since  there is almost nothing the German military did not produce a *Dienstanweisung* on,  but it leaves me curious enough to do some digging. Tracing the development of submarine cuisine could be interesting. I am just not sure I\u2019d be willing to wade through the reams of self-aggrandising *U-Boot-Fahrer*  reminiscences that made it into print in the postwar years to sort fact  from fiction.

{"title": "Boil-in-the-Bag Meals, 15th century style", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/14/boil-in-the-bag-meals/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/14/boil-in-the-bag-meals/)\n\n After reading about the [bread ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/11/medieval-nose-to-tail-cooking/)[and ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/10/experiment-bread-dumplings/)[meat puddings](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/27/meat-pudding-from-meister-hans/) Meister Hans cooks in stomachs, I decided to revisit the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf) for this gem about campaign cookery:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5gmd4n6izbb1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=740377b7da247926ad333d246e013fc0aaaa6108\n\n ***27*** ***If you should go on campaign (*****hervart*****) and are to cook many things, but do not have many pots, take the*** **bruchen** ***(one  of the stomachs) of cattle and sheep and the stomach of a pig and clean  them. Put into these each what you want, black, yellow, green, with  root vegetables, with onions, whatever you like. Put each into a bruchen  by itself with its own cooking liquid (*****soet*****). Close it up  well, each with its separate content. Place these in a pan or a cauldron  and let them boil until it is done. Then serve it as prettily as you  can.***\n\nThe idea of using stomachs  as  cooking containers to produce  different dishes is as simple as it is fascinating. Of course the  practice of cooking things inside various animal intestines is amply  attested through history, but here the idea is specifically to produce  variety by separating out dishes prepared with some attention to detail  such as colour. This is not a makeshift dish to stave off hunger in the  fields, it is a piece of culinary sleight-of-hand worthy of a master  cook. Though it was done on campaign (*hervart* refers to an army  in the field), this would be what was served to senior officers whose  retinue allowance traditionally included a personal cook at full (in  some cases double) landsknecht pay.\n\n Putting the idea into practice calls for an ample supply of water and  some skill with needle and thread, but there is no reason to think it  was challenging. The stomachs would need to stay watertight, but that is  easier than it looks \u2013 I managed it accidentally by sewing one shut too  conscientiously. The muscular membrane is easier to handle than thin  and easily torn intestine. As to what would go into it, I assume just  about any vegetable dish, but also beaten eggs, bread pudding, or  porridge grains. If we assume that a cook would have access to the  stomachs of one or two slaughtered animals, the range of options was  already considerable. A ruminant would provide several containers, but  even a much simpler constructed pig still had an oesophagus and windpipe  to press into service.

It is a fascinating example of what  happens when refined seventeenth-century European tastes meet a Native  American culinary tradition: \n\n \n\n[Bananas and other tropical fruit, seventeenth-century still life](https://preview.redd.it/hp6npup9c9ya1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06736aa52301037cb24f4e1045fe2046cfa86a98)\n\n***\u201cI have said elsewhere that the Indians prepare a paste  which they carry with them on their voyages and which supplies their  food and drink. Those who wish to prepare this paste with more care  first dry the plantains (*****bananes*****) in the oven or in the sun.  Then they grate them, and next mix them with ground sugar, with a little  bit of cinnamon powder, of cloves, and of ginger, a proper amount of  flour and the white of an egg to bind all these things together mixed  with a little bit of orange flower water. You make pastilles (*****tablettes*****) of this which you dry in the sun or in an oven, and they are very good and nourishing.\u201d***\n\nThis is from volume three of the Nouveau Voyage. The account the  author refers to is in volume one, where he describes how the \u201cIndians\u201d  (probably Kalinago) mash plantains and shape the paste into loaves which  they dry in the sun. These are then used as travel supplies, either  eaten directly or dissolved in water to make a thick beverage.  Unfortunately, we receive no instruction on how to eat the refined  version, but I suppose they could be chewed as they are or cooked into a  porridge-like dish.\n\nThe general process at work here is unsurprising: A foreign food, and  in this case more unusually also a process associated with it, is  adapted to the taste of the European upper  classes by adding  high-status ingredients. Labat was a member of the metropolitan French  upper class coversant with the new mode of eating that was emerging  around this time, and he took a serious interest in food. His  descriptions are generally trustworthy.  I think this will be worth  trying out.\n\nIncidentally, though modern usage differs, when Labat writes of *bananes*,  he means the cooking variety we call plantains. He makes this clear  later in the text when he explains that what the French call *bananes*, the Spanish refer to as *plantains*. The fruit he calles *figues d\u2019Amerique*  are closest to what we know as banana today, though they were probably  not very much like our modern, transport-optimised cultivar.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/139ymzv/banana_pastilles_17th_century/", "created_utc": 1683399135.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/139ymzv/banana_pastilles_17th_century/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I crossposted to r/CaribbeanCuisine.\n\nFeel free to share anything related to Buccaneer food or Caribbean culinary history there."]}

For today, a few short and  mildly confusing ones for illusion food:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m14v9en32ya1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b871e5a29a1f551236b74d0e9d306b579fe43864\n\n***44 If you would make a curd cheese (ziger) of almonds, pound the almonds and drain (seck) them through a cloth. Take half the milk and boil it, and then pour cold milk on it mixed with sugar.***\n\n***45 If you would make a hedgehog out of almonds, take  almond milk and boil it very thoroughly, drain it, and let it dry on a  cloth. Prepare it in such a way that it hardens. Then stick slivered (getailt) almonds into it and pour almond milk over it. And if you would colour it yellow, you may also do that etc.***\n\n***46 If you would make a cheese (ch\u00e4s) out of almonds, take almond milk and boil it with wine so that it curdles (gerin) and then drain it through a cloth over straw. And let it harden. Then put it into a vat (kar) and mix it with sugar and with other spices (read*** **gew\u00fcrtzen** ***for*** **gelb\u00fcrtzen**) ***and serve it dry.***\n\n***47 If you would prepare poached eggs (verlornew ayer)  of almonds, divide the (almond) milk in two parts. Colour the first  part yellow and put a yolk into it. From the other part, you make white  cakes (zeltel) etc. Pour more almond milk on it that should be coloured yellow, and also sugar it. This is good etc.***\n\nAlmond milk was used in many luxurious illusion foods that were often  meant to simulate dairy or eggs during Lent. Almond cheese is the most  frequently encountered. This dish is meant to resemble a much more  commonplace meal of fresh curd cheese served with milk or whey (the  \u2018curds and whey\u2019 of [Little Miss Muffet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Miss_Muffet)). The almond dishes can variously be firmed up with [bread](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/27/almond-cheese-from-cgm-384-ii/), [curdled with wine](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/02/almond-cheese-from-the-inntalkochbuch/), thickened with [rice flour](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/11/almond-cheese-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/), or [made into an isinglass jelly](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/20/almond-jelly-from-the-oeconomia/).  None of these are mentiopned here, which  makles me wolnder whether it  is simply left to the cook\u2019s discretion or whether there is a way of  coagulating almond milk by heat alone.\n\nThe almond hedgehog is another[ fairly commonly encountered dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/01/an-almond-hedgehog-from-the-inntalkochbuch/), as are [hedgehog shapes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/21/rice-recipes-from-the-kuenstlichs-und-fuertrefflichs-kochbuch/) in general. Here, the body seems to be made of coagulated almond milk.\n\nThe second recipe for cheese (*ch\u00e4s* rather than *ziger*) illustrates  a dialect distinction between fresh curds and aged cheese. Today, the word Ziger denotes a [cheese made from whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziger),  but that is clearly not, or at least not always, the meaning in  medieval recipes. What we can lewarn from it is that hard cheese was  served dry, but fresh curds were commonly eaten with a liquid, probably  whey, to accompany them.\n\nThe recipe for *verlornew ayer* is the least clear of the four. Today, *verlorene Eier*  refers to poached eggs, but it is possible the word then referred to  what we would call fried eggs. It sounds to me as though the idea is to  make small rounds of white almond jelly and place yellow-coloured  \u2018yolks\u2019 inside them. Beyond this, I  can say very little about it, but  again, fake egg recipes are [not ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/04/lenten-fried-eggs-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)[uncommon](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/12/fake-hard-boiled-eggs/).\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes.

Chop it well together, but not too small. Melt (*****brenne*****)  a good piece of fat in this and then break two or three eggs into it  and parsley. Do not make it too thin with the eggs and fat, and also  take wheat flour and groats (*****grie\u00df*****), one spoonful, but not as much as the wheat flour, or also add (*****grated*****) white Semel bread to it if you can have it. Thus they become thick. Make the mass quite thick, as for meatballs (*****flaysch knoedlein*****).  When the meat broth is boiling, lay them in and let them cook quite  gently.

Is the egg supposed  to be added to the hot fat or after the mixture has cooled? Either would  make a great difference to the outcome. My first attempt is a  fairly  basic *Grie\u00dfkn\u00f6del* held together with raw egg. I fried the  onions with a generous dusting of pepper and a good amount of lard until  they were soft and began to caramelise, then let them cool. Once it was  safe to do so, I added  the eggs, chopped parsley, and a mix of flour,  semolina, and grated bread, with the greatest quantity made up of flour.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Simmering](https://preview.redd.it/i51135utcita1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c34d8ed968f1192e1865ed0ea43fef9d0f68441)\n\n One the mix was as thick as meat dumplings (which is not really a safe  guide given how much  meat dumplings can differ), I shaped it into  dumplings and dropped then gently in simmering water. They cooked nicely  and came out in one piece, even keeping their shape better than I  expected. They didn\u2019t even taste bad as such, they just fell so far  short of their potential. The consistency was stodgy, heavy and hard,  and compared to the other dumplings we made these felt too dense and not  rich enough. The flavour combination was definitely appealing, but the   balance was off. I want to repeat the experiment, but I think they  would gain greatly from using less flour and more grated bread, chopping  the onions more finely, and adding butter or melted lard at a later  stage in the proceedings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12jwroe/experiment_peasant_dumplings_1559/", "created_utc": 1681329020.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12jwroe/experiment_peasant_dumplings_1559/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Looks like the beginnings of matzo ball soup"]}

The medical issues are not letting up (fortunately, I am healthy now,  but not everyone in my family is), so I ask your forbearance  for very  likely missing out a few days this coming week.

Hard custards  \u2013 *Eierk\u00e4se* or *Eiermilch* \u2013 are a staple of German foods in the 15th and 16th centuries, and I included a [fair ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/19/another-roasted-milk-recipe/)[number ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/roast-milk-from-the-rheinfrankisches-kochbuch/)[of ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/13/roasted-milk-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[them ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/30/roast-milk-again-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)in  this blog already. What makes this list interesting is the systematic  way it presents various options of what to do with them: battering and  frying, roasting, serving in sauces. This approach in the Innsbrucker  Rezeptbuch is quite endearing and suggests  that it was produced in one  piece and by someone taking a structured, logistical approach to  cookery. For the German tradition, this is a remarkably early example. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

One of the company became her server and brought her in his bare hands  apples, pears, nuts, and cheese. His name was*** **Spiegelm\u00e4s** ***(mirror tit, as in the bird). He laid down the cheese in one piece. She was happy and ate (frass)  it with its rind \u2013 why should she have removed it? He bit open the nuts  for her with his teeth so that the blood ran out. He began peeling the  apples at the stem and the pears at the bottom. A boor who follows his  practice! Then he looked into the pitcher and saw there was not enough  wine (mosts) in it. That is why he took a heavy serving vessel  and shook it to see whether there was anything left in that. The wine  sloshed around, which pleased him. He poured it into the pitcher and  filled it (understand me how full) so that it ran over on all sides.***\n\n***But this was nothing compared to what I still have to  tell you. Else, not wanting to insult her host, grasped the pitcher with  both hands and thrust in her mouth and nose, so much did she enjoy the  wine. When she found a morsel of food in it, she picked it out with her  bare hands and drank so strongly and long that she was all out of breath  in the end. But right after she had caught her breath again, she  started again, looking over the rim (of her vessel) like a wild bear.  She let her head drop and drank so that her eyes watered and her ears  drooped from drinking. But there was still liquid left. That is why she  painfully twisted herself to tilt her head backwards with the pitcher \u2013  she thought this was good manners. She leaned her back against a tree  and cried out as though dreaming: \u201cWoe me, woe! The pitcher is dry and  empty! Pour me some more, and bring me the second course, I want it!\u201d***\n\nAgain, the description of manners is designed to evoke disgust and  ridicule. On top of the exaggerated poor behaviour, the fact that a  woman is guilty of it increases the titillation factor for upper-class  readers. These weird peasant girls\u2026  Again, the details of her  behaviour, from lifting up a heavy pitcher to letting food get into the  drink, making noises, getting out of breath, and looking at others over  the vessel are exactly the opposite of refined manners. The *Wahre Hoveschheit*, a late fifteenth century Westfalian text on manners, prescribes this:\n\n***When you want to drink, lift up the cup above the table  with both hands, drink, and set it down. If you want to put it down near  you, put it so far from you that those who are supposed to have it next  can reach it. You must not drink with one hand like a wagoner greasing  his cart. You must not drink while the person at the head of the table  is drinking, and neither while someone who sits by you is drinking. You  must not blow into the cup like a cook blows into his ladle. You must  not drink while you have food in your mouth like cattle do. You must not  look (at people) over the cup like a cow. You must not drink noisily  like an ox. You must not make noises in your throat like a horse. You  must not talk over your cup like a drunken innkeeper. You must not stick  your thumb into the cup like a woman tapping beer. You must not drink  up to the bottom like a sexton (or: cottager?*** **koster**).  ***You must not lick your lips afterwards like a bad piper who has spoiled  the dance. You must not drink from all along the cup\u2019s rim like a  sheep. You must not take overly long draughts like a pigeon. You must  not breathe noisily afterwards like a bear. You must not hang your nose  into the cup like a pig. You must not drink up the wine like an ox  drinks water. You must not drink up the cup entirely or by half like an  Estonian. You must not drink before the meal like a Russian. You must  not drink in one long draught like a nursemaid. You must not drink on an  empty stomach like people who were drunk the night before. If you want  to take a drink of mead \u2018on an empty stomach\u2019, then know this: the first  drink after eating is called a drink \u2018on an empty stomach\u2019. You should  wipe your nose and mouth after drinking. You must not hold the cup in  your hand too long.***\n\nInterestingly, the *Hoveschheit* also addresses the proper way to peel pears and apples, and there really was a rule to it:\n\n***If you want to peel a pear, start at the stem, but if you want to peel an apple, start from the head.***\n\nWe really begin to see how the Ring was written, and it  leads us  right back to the words of \u00dcbelgsmach (evils taste/smell) in the chapter  preceding the wedding feast:\n\n***But it is said often and much: If you would be a  courtier, imagine a peasant and do the opposite of whatever he does in  his boorish manner. Thus you become courtly and decorous***.\n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem \u201aDer Ring\u2018 (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself to  translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners, but  would advise anyone with enough command of German to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11u131i/how_not_to_drink_at_the_table_c_1410/", "created_utc": 1679081249.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11u131i/how_not_to_drink_at_the_table_c_1410/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Set it in a cool place (*****in ein kalter*****) with the tips of the shells (*****sampt der spitzen*****)  and leave the skewer in it so it sets as though they were hard-boiled  eggs. Then withdraw the skewers, peel off the shells and slice it on a  plate like other hard-boiled eggs.***\n\n[Emptying ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/08/scrambled-eggs-returned-to-their-shells/)[and ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/02/filled-eggshells-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)[then ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/03/another-two-recipes-for-kroseier/)[refilling ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/11/filled-eggs-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)[eggshells ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/13/stuffed-eggs-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)seems  to have been a popular trick in the repertoire of medieval cooks. By   1559, it was a time-honoured tradition, and in this case the shells only  function as a mould to impart the correct shape. Here, the result is  hard-boiled eggs made from almonds. \n\nFirst, a yolk is formed from an almond mass that I assume would  resemble what we call marzipan dyed with saffron. This is suspended in  an eggshell on a skewer holding it in place. I assume this is stood on  its end vertically, the \u2018yolk\u2019 inserted through the opening at the broad  end. The rest of the eggshell is then refilled with almond milk  described as thick. This may well have been enriched with some kind of  gelling agent, though sufficiently rich almond milk was supposed to  solidify on its own accord. The eggs were then stored in a cool place  until they set, the skewers carefully removed, the whole peeled and  sliced to serve on a plate. This dish could be served with some hearty [cracklings ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/01/fake-chopped-meat-and-cracklings-for-lent/)or a [bratwurst  ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/28/lenten-bratwurst-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)sausage \u2013 or rather, their Lenten versions.  \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

Life was intense in the past  week or so, I cooked a Late Roman feast (recipes and pictures to follow)  and prepared Christmas cookies all the while covering for sick  colleagues at work and other stuff. But here it is, from the *Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch*:   \n\n \n\n[Beuckelaer \\(1564\\): Poultry Market](https://preview.redd.it/9twjqop05p7a1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c8c24829b41bb98cee90ef953117ba851a4e99a)\n\n***42*** **Zwikische** ***Chickens***\n\n***Take a chicken and scald it all around. Then take four  or five eggs, according to how large the chicken is, beat them, take  bacon and a little parsley and chop that well, and mix that with the  eggs. Take a little mace, lay that into a broth if you can have that  from elsewhere (anderst i.e. from a different meat). But if you wish,  pound an entire nutmeg and strew a little on this. You may also beat  quite thick milk into the eggs, the people of*** **Zwicken** ***(*****Zwickau*****)  do it thus. If they do not use thick milk with it, they (the chickens)  do not turn out well. And if you can have no bacon, take marrow from  meat bones or May butter, and fill the chickens inside while the guts  are in them (*****da die derm in liegen*****). Sew them shut. You may also use the broth if there is much of it. Let it boil up smoothly (*****fein glat** ***i.e.  simmer, not a rolling boil), and the sooner it boils and is served up,  the better it will be. They are not good if they stand long.***\n\nWhat I find most interesting about this recipe is the fact that it is  named after a city, presumably its origin. Zwickau was a textile  manufacturing town in Saxony and, as far as we know, without culinary  distinction. It is thus a little surprising that it provides the name  for a recipe, but it does. Neither is the recipe implausible as such.  The eastern parts of Germany, including Saxony, were at this point home  to the [Wends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wends),  a people speaking a West Slavic language that is today extinct. Like  all West Slavic peoples, they were later known as skilful producers of  dairy products, and that tradition may go back far. Especially Saxony  also had a reputation for rich cookery. A chicken filled with eggs and  clabbered milk could easily have come from that area of Germany.    \n\nUsing eggs to fill chickens also goes back quite far, with the first mention coming from the Anthimus text in the[ Lorscher Arzneibuch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorscher_Arzneibuch).  Combining eggs with the organ meats of the chicken and, at times,  spices and fruit for a filling is recorded frequently and may well have  been what the Ulenspiegel stories refer to as the \u2018German manner\u2019 of  filling chickens as opposed to the herb fillings called the \u2018Italian  (welsche) manner\u2019. This looks to be a variation on that theme. \n\nHere, the chickens are prepared and filled with a mixture of beaten  egg, parsley, bacon, and clabbered milk, most likely something like the [Herbstmilch ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/08/herbstmilch-from-the-inntalkochbuch-and-beyond/)that  Coler later associates with the same geographic area. The organs of the  chicken are placed in the body cavity along with the filling, though we  should probably assume that the guts were cleaned out and the  connective tissues removed beforehand. They may have been cooked and  chopped, as they are in other recipes, but that is not a given. After  sewing shut the chickens, which would prevent the filling from escaping,  the whole would be cooked in hot broth and served fresh. The filling,  hot and rich with dariy and egg, certainly must have been best straight  out of the pot. I have not tried this, but I just may. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

{"title": "Kitchen Memories of a Plague Year", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/13/memories-of-a-plague-year/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/13/memories-of-a-plague-year/)\n\nThis came across my social media feed again a few days ago. Back in  the days when we were limited to meetings of just two households, no  conferences, reenactments, markets or feasts happening. That was when I  began translating a recipe every day, in order to keep myself stable,  and when I started a habit of going out to meet friends at home to cook  them together.  Some of those two-households-alike-in-desperation  meetings left me very positive memories. This was one of them. We cooked  fifteenth-century foods (mostly) from the collection of [Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-Meister-Hans.pdf).\n\n**Chicken Fritters**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8bivb1nop5a1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9445f6be7104b2b96f54e595462b965022202ce3\n\nThese are lanncz fritters \u2013 made with chicken breast meat, as the  recipe allows, rather than the livers and stomachs described initially.\n\n***A dish of chickens that is called*** **lanncz**\n\n***Item take chicken livers and stomachs and cut them thinly and deep-fry (pachs)  them in fat. Add to them fat, pepper, eggs, caraway, and salt. Stir it  together as soft as (the filling for) filled eggs (and) push (streich) them into boiling fat in a pot so that they stay whole. That way they are fried until done. Then serve it, this is called*** **lanncz**. ***In the same way, you can prepare young chickens or lamb.***\n\nI  used spoons to drop small portions into hot fat, which worked well.  Using a board in the manner of spaetzle would also have worked, except  the drop into a modern deep fryer is too steep. Caraway serves  surprisingly well as a main flavour, but on the whole the dish is a bit  underwhelming this way. Livers and stomachs are better suited to it, if  cooked for a more adventurous audience.\n\n**Meat Pastries**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2in709hqop5a1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f04fa1bb65e90cab9e372afa9b258e36b823e98\n\nThese are meat pastries from Anna Wecker\u2019s 1598 cookbook. They are a  familiar fallback option. Good, but a bit boring. A certain crowd  pleaser when there are children present,. however.\n\n***Krapffen von dem ubergebliebnen Fleisch***\n\n***Pastries of leftover meat***\n\n***Take  of such (meat) as you have that is no longer suitable for the table ,  it is good for these things. Cut the meat off the bones and chop it  well. Make a dough of fine flour and eggs, a little fat, salt it well,  or the way you make it for tarts, as you please.***\n\n***Take  two thin sheets, one as big as the other, shape it as you would like it  and as you can, round, triangular, or rectangular, into hearts, roses,  or stars. The add good spices to the meat, raisins, and what you like to  have sweet or sour, as you please. (Add) enough fat from what is  skimmed off soups (Suppenschmalz) or beef marrow, according to  how fat or lean the meat itself is. If you wish, you can also add good  herbs, with or without spices, or eggs as though you wanted to make  sausages that go into the fat-lined part of the large intestine (Klobw\u00fcrste).  You may also take coarsely ground almonds, (but) they are better  grated, especially if you also add eggs, and grate a little bit of hard  white bread if you please. Always add a little meat broth.***\n\n***If  you want to make them, prepare it (the meat) and put a little of it on  part of the abovementioned sheets (shaped) according to whatever you  want of animals, birds, hounds , hares, as described above. Shape it  with the prepared stuff (meat mixture) and then place the second sheet  on top. Press it together according to its shape and close it as  artfully as you can.***\n\n***Give each its  form: to the sow, bristles with a pastry wheel, give each one eyes from  black dried cherries or juniper berries, (arrange) the skin of an egg  around it or of red apples or rose petals, each after its kind. As to  what else belongs to them, I have kept the little sheep\u2019s trotters and  such things as well as the young hares\u2019 feet, those who are artful do  not need much description, to those who aren\u2019t it is in vain. Roughly  done does not improve them or detract from them. Close them, brush them  with egg as is always done, bake them quickly and serve them warm. They  are best without egg, but to each as they like it. Almonds and a little  bread makes them good.***\n\nThis is not so much a recipe as a method. Since we rarely have  leftover meat, I tend to boil or roast a cheap cut for those, but they  are well suited for the day after Thanksgiving or Christmas. And of  course they can serve as an outlet for creativity if you are so  inclined.\n\n***Falcon Dish (or maybe just a thick mush)***\n\nThis is an interesting egg dish: habich muos (egg with herbs cooked in the shell)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10q487btop5a1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7596d6e235621d3fd0b05954f382eb4f6c8ea69\n\n***Recipe #88*** **Ain habich muo\u00df von ayren**\n\n***A \u2018falcon dish\u2019 of eggs***\n\n***Item chop sage small and fry it in butter. Mix herbs and  saffron into it and make a \u2018falcon dish\u2019 from it. Fill it back into the  shells and lay them into boiling water. Boil them and quarter them  nicely afterwards.***\n\nThe etymology of habich is unclear. It may be an adjective.\n\nHere, I fried fresh sage in butter, added it to the raw egg with salt  and parsley, and returned the batter to the shells. I was unfortunately  unable to find a good way of stabilising them in boiling water (no egg  cooker on hand) so instead I cooked them in an oven standing in egg  cartons. Don\u2019t do that. They were tasty, but ugly. I am convinced a  gentle simmering will be much more effective.\n\n***Raisin Marzipan Pears***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rb9nncgxop5a1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7de043411bcff33b76e55531f2171fdfa1f856c0\n\nLittle dessert pears \u2013 a variation on the theme of marzipan.\n\n***Recipe # 129*** **Ain essen gestalt als die piern mach also**\n\n***Make a dish shaped like pears thus***\n\n***Item  take well-selected Italian raisins and pound them in a mortar. Take  blanched almond kernels and pound them together with that. Mix ginger  and sugar into it. When that is done, knead it in your hand so that it  is shaped like a pear and stick a stalk into it.***\n\nHaving  a mortar large enough, or a really potent food processor, helps here,  but even so they were good. I used 150g of raisins, an equa quantity of  ground almonds, and 100g of sugar, seasoned with ginger. The resulting  mass looks surprisingly similar to pears in colour (though not in this  light). It would come even closer if it were mixed more finely.\n\nIt was altogether a lovely meal, and one I recall with fondness.  There was also a berry sauce, a dish of fritters, and salad. We can have  bigger gatherings again, but there is something to be said for the  intimate setting of these extended family meals.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/zl3j4f/kitchen_memories_of_a_plague_year/", "created_utc": 1670957472.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/zl3j4f/kitchen_memories_of_a_plague_year/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

{"title": "Fish Roe Fritters - An Old Experiment", "selftext": "Life is limiting my ability to produce new translations, so I\u2019ll fall back on sharing some old experiments I made during pandemic lockdown for now. This is an interesting[ recipe using fish roe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/12/fish-roe-pancakes-in-roux-sauce/) from the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ri19g0lp3pe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62a7efa2bf81e6e9ed73a84bb275eea1a4aea75c\n\n# Item if you would make a fried cake (spisekoken) of pike roe, take roe that is finely ground in a mill. Add to it parsley, figs, raisins, what (whichever?) you have, and white bread. Stir it strongly with sweet oil and put it into another mortar or thick-walled vessel that is in proper measure (large enough). Let it fry strongly (or: long? tohope) in hot oil with a gentle fire. When it is done, cut it into pieces as thick as you think you can manage. Take pepper and saffron. Take vinegar and honey. Make a sauce of that. Serve the cake with this.\n\nI started out with the only fish roe I could get \u2013 herring. The fishmonger actually gutted the fish to get it for me. I am not sure how the qualities of herring and pike roe differ, and if I ever get my hands on pike roe I will try it. So far, though, that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nThe roe made a smooth puree very quickly. I ran the processor a second time to break open the individual eggs because I assume that would happen in a handmill. At this stage, the roe was pronouncedly smelly, but that changed completely on cooking.\n\nI made the dough with only breadcrumbs and raisins, not figs for the first batch because I was making so little. It became solid much faster than I expected, so I had to shape patties. I am not sure whether that is how it was supposed to go, though some recipes for the non-Lenten version envision it.\n\nFried in oil, the finished *spisekoken* were quite good, even better than the standard grated bread pancakes so common in the medieval German tradition. I only added a bit of pepper to see how they carried spice. The answer was: well. They were clearly fish, but not very fishy, and will very likely work well with any kind of sauce.\n\nMore pictures at: [https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/16/fish-roe-fritters-an-old-experiment/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/16/fish-roe-fritters-an-old-experiment/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1jct674/fish_roe_fritters_an_old_experiment/", "created_utc": 1742152440.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1jct674/fish_roe_fritters_an_old_experiment/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Probably Bread Dumplings (15th c)", "selftext": "Here\u2019s a tantalising opportunity to interpret on very thin ice. The Dorotheenkloster MS includes a brief recipe for \u2013 something:\n\n[\\\\\"The Dumpling Eater\\\\\" Fresco from Hocheppan castle, South Tyrol](https://preview.redd.it/l48mgb3no3ie1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8461531417fe62885393ad0c7610b173f7f8965b)\n\n***113 A plain (slechtz) dish***\n\n***Take good broth, saffron, sage, and vinegar that is moderately sour and let it boil up. Mix (tempirs) eggs, fine bread, and cut bacon into it. Lay it in boiling water, let it boil up, and serve it.***\n\nIt is hard to say what this is supposed to become. Depending on how you interpret the proportions of ingredients and the process, it could be a soup, a custard, or a kind of bread porridge. The name doesn\u2019t help. The dish is *slecht* \u2013 a misleading word to modern Germans that means smooth or plain. The latter interpretation looks more plausible given no pureeing is involved.\n\nNow, the instruction at the end is interesting: Lay (*leg*) it in boiling water. Culinary vocabulary is not very detailed in Middle High German, but this verb implies placing a piece or unit of something in the water, not adding a liquid or something to be dissolved. Making a solid mass requires a small amount of broth, vinegar, and egg to be added to a larger quantity of bread, and that would give us dumplings \u2013 *Semmelkn\u00f6del*. Seasoned with sage and enriched with bacon, they would look familiar to us, but of course they are rather speculative.\n\nThe idea of using bread to make things like dumplings, porridges and pancakes was not exotic in medieval Germany, quite the contrary. Grated bread was used to thicken sauces and soups, [travellers carried it as emergency cooking supplies](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/07/dried-breadcrumb-supplies/). A kind of bread pudding \u2013 cut bread and bacon bound with egg and cooked in a calf\u2019s stomach \u2013 features in [my favourite fifteenth-century \u201cno shit, there I was\u201d kitchen story](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/11/medieval-nose-to-tail-cooking/). It is notably similar to what is described here.\n\nBread dumplings are also amply attested later. We have recipes from[ several sixteenth](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/31/peasant-dumplings/)\u2013[century sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/13/dumpling-recipes-from-the-oeconomia-part-three/), and I have already successfully [tried out](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/10/experiment-bread-dumplings/) [some of them](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/12/experiment-peasant-dumplings/). It is not surprising to find them attested in the fifteenth century. They are quite expected. Still, it is cool to find what may be an actual recipe. Dry bread, moistened with hot broth and vinegar, seasoned with sage, coloured with saffron, mixed with bacon cubes and egg, shaped into dumplings and cooked in water; It sounds plain but attractive. Quite the *slechtz ch\u00f6stel*.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ilcx6w/probably_bread_dumplings_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739101173.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ilcx6w/probably_bread_dumplings_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Serving Mashed Peas (15th c.)", "selftext": "Mashed peas are not exactly the most exciting of foods, but the Dorotheenkloster MS has some suggestions how to serve them, including one recipe with parallels a century later:\n\n***71 A different gm\u00fcs of peas***\n\n***Take peas and grind them nicely. You make a gemues of this as you please, warm or cold. Pour them out on a bowl when they are boiled. Cut it twice through the centre, take out the middle piece, and pour mustard into it (the hole).***\n\n***72 Another dish of peas***\n\n***Take peas and boil them until they shed their shells. Rub them small and pour in (a little water) so they do not become too thin. Then take rice that is well boiled, lay that in the middle, and serve it.***\n\n***73 Bohemian (behaymsch) peas***\n\n***Take good peas, pick them thoroughly clean and make them pretty (shell them) with lye. Take the peas and boil them dry. When they are boiled, you must have good boiled pork and you must have good pearl wheat (? gruppem). If you do not have those, take good barley that must be boiled dry. Now take a wooden spoon and mash (zeuch) the peas in the pot so they become white. Make them thin with the pork broth and do not salt them until when you are about to serve them. Take the pork, cut it lengthwise, and brown it in a pan. When you want to serve it, take the barley which must not be salted and arrange it dry on a bowl. Then take the pork and arrange it on top of the barley. The peas must also be warm. Arrange them on a bowl. They must not be thick. Serve them together as a meal/course (essen).***\n\n***74 Another dish of peas***\n\n***Take the same peas and clean boiled bacon. Cut it in cubes, brown it in a pan, put it on the peas and serve it.***\n\nIt may need saying that we are always talking about dried and cooked peas here. Peas were considered a field crop, not a vegetable, and stored dry for later cooking. There is some evidence that people ate fresh green peas, but that was not their main purpose. These recipes are for what we would call pease pudding.\n\nClearly, the thing itself was considered a bit dull. In recipe #71, presentation is everything: a bowl full of mashed peas is cut through twice in each direction to create a square section in the middle which is then lifted out and the space filled with mustard. This suggests mashed peas were preferred firm, not soupy. That could be achieved by removing the cooked peas from the cooking water before they fall apart. The liquid could then be used for other purposes, the \u2018pea broth\u2019 or *Erbsbr\u00fche* of many fast day dishes. Mustard was often served with peas, sometimes [mixed with honey](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/12/rainworms-made-of-peas/), and in Northern Germany peas and mustard were the traditional accompaniment to herring.\n\nRecipe #72 combines mashed peas and rice for a two-colour dish, white rice centered with yellow-green peas around the edge. The rice, of course, was also cooked to a porridgelike consistency. European rice was round-grain and [the finished dishes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/11/cooking-rice/) resembled *Milchreis* or risotto.\n\nIn recipe #73, we meet so-called[ \u2018Bohemian\u2019 peas](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/13/bohemian-peas-again/) once more. It is still not clear what makes them Bohemian, but this recipe is actually for a set of dishes. The basis is a grain porridge. *Graupen* \u2013 here *gruppem* \u2013 is pearl barley in modern German, but since it is contrasted with barley here, Aichholzer reads it as wheat. These would likely be hulled and perhaps polished grains, pearl wheat treated much like pearl barley. Either way, they are cooked \u2018dry\u2019, that is so that they remain discrete grains, but become soft. Slices of boiled pork browned in a hot pan are arrangen on top and the peas that give their name to the whole thing mashed, thinned with broth, and served alongside. If you add a good mustard sauce and some vegetables, this would still make an attractive wintertime dinner.\n\nNotably, the dish has little in common with what is called by the same name either in the [Innsbruck MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Innsbrucker-Rezeptbuch.pdf) or [Philippine Welser\u2019s collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/13/bohemian-peas-again/). The former is simply mashed peas, shelled in lye, with a yellow broth while the latter is served with a piece of boiled, then fried bacon cut in a chequerboard pattern on top. Neither involves a grain dish of barley or wheat.\n\nIt is in fact #74 that comes closer to what Philippine Welser\u2019s collection calls Bohemian peas. We do not know whether the boiled bacon here is meant to be cut into discrete cubes or merely scored \u2013 *w\u00fcrfellat* can mean either \u2013 but the similarity is clear either way.\n\nThere are many more complex and adventurous things medieval cooks did with peas, not least the [relevant ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/29/all-about-peas-part-one/)[section ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/30/all-about-peas-part-two/)in the Innsbruck MS. They were used for [fritters ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/06/kuchenmaistrey-in-print-and-pea-patties/)and [roasted ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/14/roasted-peas-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/)[on ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/08/another-roast-peas-recipe-from-meister-eberhard/)[skewers ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/11/roast-pease-pudding-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)or turned into [worm-shaped show dishes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/12/rainworms-made-of-peas/). The recipes from the Dorotheenkloster MS are pedestrian by comparison, but they are clear and attractive.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Curlews Filled with Berries (15th c.)", "selftext": "This is today\u2019s recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gptkxxnvjn8e1.jpg?width=4344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ec8c7d1c03015f401e844a37f03917f63290287\n\n***19 Of curlews*** ***(prachvogel)***\n\n***Take curlews and wash them cleanly. Take small (read klaine for kaini) wild berries (wiltp\u00f6r) and pour wine or vinegar on them. When they soften, thrust (st\u00f6zze) them into the birds with spices. Boil (sud \u2013 possibly an error for roast) them on a skewer.***\n\nFor all its brevity, this recipe is interesting and difficult to parse. The bird in question is most likely the curlew (Numenius arquata). We do not consider it an edible bird these days, but standards in medieval Germany were a good deal more inclusive.\n\nThe first problem we encounter is the fact that the recipe, read literally, would say to take no berries. I assume this is another instance of the common error confusing *klein* (small) and *kein* (none). Secondly, it is unclear what \u2018wild berries\u2019 are. This could be a reference to berries gathered \u2018wild\u2019, i.e. foraged, but in the fifteenth century that applied to almost all kinds. It might also mean the kind of berries usually served with venison (wildbret), though again, there are numerous recipes for sauces made with different berries. There is no compelling solution, and Aichholzer wisely renders her reading ambiguous.\n\nThe second question arises from the interpretation of *st\u00f6zze* which can mean to pound or to thrust or push. Aichholzer reads this as a separate instruction \u2013 pound the berries, then fill them into the birds as a paste. I don\u2019t think that is practical and rather interpret it as filling the birds with berries soaked in wine. This would also suggest a thick-skinned kind of fruit, maybe blueberries, currants, or cowberries, rather than the softer raspberry and strawberry.\n\nFinally, there is the sentence instructing the reader to boil (*sud*) the birds on skewers. Unlike others, this verb is unambiguous and always means cooking in a liquid. This is very surprising and probably counterproductive for birds prepared this way. Confusing cooking techniques is an easy mistake to make, so it is reasonable to follow Aichholzer in simply reading this as \u2018roast\u2019. We should bear in mind, though, that birds on skewers can be boiled.\n\nThe flavour profile sounds promising: gamey wildfowl suffused with the fruity tartness of berries and no doubt with spices and fat added as was customary with all roast birds.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Pike Cooked Three Ways (15th c.)", "selftext": "Today\u2019s recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS has long antecedents and a close parallel.\n\n[Experimenting with cooking fish wrapped partly in a wet cloth.](https://preview.redd.it/84datn16w17e1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3836477442fc3739e6e0003a379e61129cc1e2b)\n\n***14 Of a pike that is boiled in the middle and roasted at both ends***\n\n***Now take a white cloth that is one hand wide or wider and moisten it with wine. Remove the liver and the stomach so that the stomach stays whole. Take a piece of the other pike and fill the stomach with it, and add some fat, that way it will turn out good. Let the liver and the stomach boil until they are done, and see the liver stays whole. Then fill them back into the pike. Take the cloth and moisten it with wine. It should be long enough to go around (the fish) twice. Wind it around the fish once. When you have wrapped it once, put salt on the cloth. Then wind the cloth over the salt, over the back and all around the pike. It should be salted all around on both sides between the cloth. Take string and wrap it all around repeatedly. The cloth must be fourfold. Now scale the fish on both ends. When you want to roast it, take a spit and thrust it through the cloth so the fish stays whole. Salt it like you do a roast fish and roast it like any other fish. Make a good strong fire underneath the cloth and a small fire under the ends. You must also have broth (to baste it) so it does not burn that way the pike boils itself in the middle. Take small pebbles that are hot and put them under the cloth, and pour the bot broth over the cloth. That way the broth drips down on the stones and the pike boils cleanly. Now roast it cleanly.***\n\n***15 Make two kinds of sauce (*****salsen*****) and a broth (*****supplein*****) for the pike***\n\n***For the tail, make a green sauce and pass it through with vinegar, that way it becomes sharp, and add spices. To the head, take a virding (quarter pound) of raisins and 1 virding of almonds that are pretty (i.e. blanched). Pound the raisins and almonds together. If you want to have a good sauce, pass it through with ravyol (Ribolla gialla wine) or runanier (Romania wine). Add good spices and sugar. That way you have a good sauce.***\n\nThis recipe is almost verbatim the same as one in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) which I translated a while ago. Much of what I will say about it here repeats [what I wrote there](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/13/another-fish-cooked-three-ways/). As is often the case, the recipe is clearer in a few points and less clear in others, so the parallels can be used to interpret each other.\n\nThe underlying recipe here is for preparing a single large fish so that different sections are cooked in different styles, typically one roasted, one boiled or steamed, and one fried. We have [numerous recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/16/a-fish-cooked-three-ways-from-meister-eberhard/) for this from [various sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/19/one-fish-cooked-three-ways-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) and the process seems to go back to Abbasid Baghdad where it is recorded in the recipebook of [ibn Sayyar al Warraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Sayyar_al-Warraq) (chapter 33, recipe 5). Surviving German recipes often differ in detail, sometimes cutting apart the fish and reassembling it, but the most impressive display of skill lay in keeping it whole, as this iteration does. I [experimented with the technique once and it works](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/05/the-good-friday-fish-feast/), but is poorly suited to a modern baking oven.\n\nThe instructions we are getting here mainly focus on preparing the middle part which is boiled (or rather steamed) under a wet cloth. Unlike the description in the parallel, this one makes it clear that the hot pebbles are placed on the fireplace bottom underneath the section wrapped in cloth, not physically under the cloth, so the effect would be adding to the moisture by producing steam. The salt between the cloth layers would dissolve in the basting liquid and permeate the fish. Interestingly, [as in the preceding recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/14/another-filled-pike/), the stomach and liver are cooked separately and returned to the body cavity, presumably a conceit that diners expected.\n\nThe front and rear parts are not treated in any detail, but we learn in a [different recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/16/a-fish-cooked-three-ways-from-meister-eberhard/) that one section could be roasted dry, the other dusted with flour and basted with fat to approximate the effect of frying. All of it would make a showy dish served with various sauces to accompany each part. As in the parallel, the sauce for the tail is a \u2018green\u2019 sauce typically made of fresh herbs and vinegar or verjuice while the one for the head section is a sweet-spice raisin sauce thickened with almonds. This recipe is clear that the wine and sugar are to be used with the raisins and almonds, not, as the parallel states, with the herbs. There is no description for the *supplein*, a word that can refer to a soup, a cooking sauce, or a cooking liquid. I assume the broth used to baste the middle part is meant to be served with it in some way.\n\nIt probably does not need saying that between calling for fresh pike and the most expensive wines, expending a vast amount of skilled labour, and probably ruining a perfectly good length of linen, this recipe represents a level of luxury bordering on decadence.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Make room between the fish and the skin (i.e. detach the skin) \u2013 you must not forget that \u2013 and do not damage the skin. Grasp under the stomach from both sides like you lift a young dog. Take out the stomach and liver. Turn the stomach inside out and fill it nicely. Take 2 pieces or 3 from a pike and chop it small, and add the blood to it, that way the filling becomes brown. Add cloves, then it turns black. Fill the stomach with this and let it boil until it is done. When the stomach has been boiled, add it (to the fish) and salt it properly. Fill the pike with that filling everywhere, (but) so that the skin is not full (i.e. taut), that way it will not tear.***\n\nSkinning fish and effectively turning them into boneless versions of themselves \u2013 a kind of fish-shaped sausage \u2013 is something many recipe collections describe. Here, we find an interesting addition: The liver and stomach are cooked separately, the stomach receiving a dark-coloured fish filling, and returned to their previous place inside the body cavity when the skin is filled with its own spiced fish forcemeat. The idea seems to be that the fish would seem whole, with its intestines, when it was cut open at the table.\n\nWe do not get much information about the actual filling here. The previous recipe offers some pointers \u2013 using egg or apple to bind it, bulking it up with pieces of other fish, and maybe adding herbs. On the whole, this would have been a familiar procedure that did not need detailed instructions. The description of lifting out the stomach by grasping it from both sides and placing the fingers underneath it to lift it like a puppy is both vivid and touching, though.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Salt them as needed and then squeeze/crush (*****zertruckhen*****) and grind this kraut well with very clean hands. Thus the water is pressed out with your hands. Discard this water, then take fresh cheese (*****schotten*****) and likewise mix it with the abovementioned kraut. This will also call for a good soft*** **Taig** ***(this could mean the dough for the crust, but also mass for filling using egg), as fresh and gentle as can be found, that is used with it. In this manner, as described before, mix it, and you can also add sugar or other spices, or make such a tart without sugar or any spices, that is up to anyone\u2019s choice and pleasure. And you must place fat in the pan underneath the dough as is needed and thus let it bake. That will be a good tart. These tarts are most fittingly and conveniently made in March.***\n\n***Note that with any and every tart, the dough and the edge/top crust (*****renfftlin*****) must be made and set up as is sufficiently described for the first one, and neither sugar nor other spice (*****species*****) be stinted if the tart is supposed to be good.***\n\nThis recipe is in no way unusual, but quite refined. The basic *kraut* tart was made with leafy greens, cheese, and eggs. *Kraut*, unless otherwise defined, usually means cabbage, but in the case of these tarts almost always means chard, spinach, parsley, or other kitchen herbs. In this case, it is very young chard leaves which, in March, would still be small and tender enough to process raw. Mixed with fresh cheese and whatever spices you wished, it would make a fine tart to celebrate the fact you had more than enough to eat in the hungry month of March.\n\nThe insistence on sugar and on a top covering that is [described elsewhere](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/20/the-other-white-tart/) as a kind of proto-meringue involving sugar, rosewater, and beaten egg white seem incongruous to moderns, but they are the signasture style of the later tart recipes in this collection. This could actually reflect a personal idiosyncrasy, the taste of Philippine Welser herself.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/27/a-chard-tart-in-march/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/27/a-chard-tart-in-march/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1h1dq89/green_tart_in_march_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1732738396.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1h1dq89/green_tart_in_march_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Rosewater should be added so the three abovementioned things are united with each other into a dough. Beforehand, you should put pounded cinnamon into the rosewater, as much or as little as anyone likes. But you must not add the rosewater to the abovementioned three materials at once, but a little at first and after it was all pounded with each other, you should pour in a little rosewater again and again and pound it more. You must continue doing this again and again until the abovementioned dough is ready for baking. Then you should take a proper tart pan and put in some of the abovementioned dough with wide wafers (*****albotten*****) underneath. Let one after the other bake properly until the dough is all used up (*****verbachenn*****). Afterwards, you can cut the same tarts into small square pieces or whatever shape your cutter (*****foram*****) has. Then they are right and good, not too small.***\n\n***But if you only want to make half as much so that you can enjoy each one fresh when you do not use up a lot, for it is best and the healthiest food to enjoy them fresh, you must only use half the quantity of the abovementioned ingredients by weight, that is:*** ***shelled almonds 4 ounces, pine nuts 2 ounces, the finest sugar 1*** **fierdung**\n\nIt is not unusual to find detailed recipes for making marzipan. It was [a fashionable luxury in sixteenth-century Germany](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/) and occurs [in many recipe books](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/03/baked-marcipan-from-balthasar-staindl/) [in many variations more or less economical](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/06/marzipan-proper-and-stretched/). In its most elaborate form, it was served sculpted and gilded or painted, often shaped with artfully carved moulds such as the one illustrating this post. This recipe envisions a more quotidian use as a small bite, an individual serving to be enjoyed alone or in small company. However, it is not an economical recipe. Pine nuts were, if anything, even more luxurious than almonds in Germany. We find them used in marzipan variations by [the courtly Marx Rumpolt](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/), but they do not feature elsewhere and certainly not as a regular ingredient. This is an interesting idiosyncrasy.\n\nThe process of making marzipan is straightforward: almonds, and here pine nuts, are blanched and ground up to a fine paste, adding rosewater as needed. This is then mixed with sugar, spread on a wafer, and gently baked. Some recipes call for [a glaze ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/)or [a scattering of confits](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/03/baked-marcipan-from-balthasar-staindl/), but these are plain roundels intended to be cut up. That was probably the most common way of serving it, in small pieces. The concern for freshness and the relative smallness of each batch \u2013 the latter would produce a mere 200-300 grammes \u2013 indicates this was an exclusive pleasure.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Then wash it cleanly in wine and lay it in a pan with a lump of fat, a little water and vinegar, and reduced wine or sugar. Take pounded ginger, pepper, and a little juniper berries, cover the pan, and set it on a griddle. Give it a good amount of coals from above and let it fry (bregla) this way until you hear it make a sound (herst klinge). Then open the pan and add saffron, cover it again and let it fry for a while longer. Then sprinkle pepper on it and serve it.***\n\nThis recipe sounds delicious, and it offers interesting insights into what we could call \u2018kitchen thinking\u2019. Fish is salted, then put into a pan with fat, vinegar, water, spices, and a sweetener (reduced wine is interesting in itsel, not something we usually associate with Renaissance German cuisine) and heated from below and above. This would be done in a pan designed like a Dutch oven, with a lid meant to hold live coals. These pans were more usually used to bake pies, but also served as cooking vessels.\n\nThe cooking process is described as *bregla*, a word that suggests a gentle, slow frying, not the sharp deep-frying so common for krapfen and battered fruit. As the fish cooks, you will know the right time to add saffron by the sound it makes. This sound is not described \u2013 how could you? You learned these things by experience.\n\nSince we are not told what kind of fish to use, I would hesitate to apply this to a large and prestigious species. Cooking small fish this way could also explain the description as \u2018broken\u2019 (zerschlagen has overtones of violence, as in smashing or shattering). Small fish would easily come apart in the pan.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Specifically, I started out with this recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqjw87a64qed1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e077a6bc46c6dd0809bd722a810473b1d475b2d8\n\n***82 A*** **fladen** ***of meat, cheese, and eggs***\n\n***Take well-boiled meat from the belly and chop it small. Take a fourth part (i.e. a quarter as much) of cheese with it and break eggs into it. Also add chicken livers and cloves, and slice a pear lengthwise and strew it among this. Place it on a sheet (of dough) and let it bake, and serve it.***\n\nSince I had a quantity of grounds beef and lamb that seemed to come fairly close to the intent as well as some chicken innards that needed using up, I decided this was going to be my work lunch for a few days. It also gave me the opportunity to try out the cast-iron g\u00f6zleme pan I\u2019d acquired on a local flea market to simulate the bottom heat of a traditional wood-fired oven.\n\nI began with a basic leavened dough. Since I have no sourdough culture in the house, I used live yeast, flour, a little salt, and lukewarm water. The result was pretty enthusiastic and I used some leftover to make breadrolls that turned out quite pretty.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxgs72584qed1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee444af5b0aca68195741594febfeaee367d6c53\n\nThe meat past I used was raw. Other *fladen* recipes specify cooked, but I am not sure that is universally the case for these recipes. I added a mild, hard cheese, eggs, and chicken livers and processede it all together, then spread it out thickly on a dough base. The mix was seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, and cumin which was a success. The addition of fruit to one of them proved a success, the attempt to add raw eggs to be cooked in indentations on the top of another did not. But on the whole, I was happy with this. It is definitely a recipe that scales and can be used to feed a lot of people.\n\nAs to how they proved suited as work lunch, the record was mixed. The dough turned leathery and tough more quickly than my pizza usually does, probably because there was no oil added, and the heavy meat topping was a bit too substantial when eaten cold. Adding a topping of cucumber, tomato, or lettuce solved the latter issue. I can imagine these working better as small, burger-sized patties on a dough base, but on the whole I like them better fresh.

They must be newly laid. Beat them well and take milk into it, a good two thumbs long (quantity?), (but) less than the eggs. When the eggs are beaten, add flour and make a good, viscous (zechen) batter that is as thick as a streybla (Strauben) batter. Afterwards, put the abovementioned batter into a square tin dish that can be covered well and that keeps out water (das waser heb?). Add three spoons full of sugar and not too much salt, and when you put the batter into the tin, put in fat before and melt it. That way it will not stick. Close the cover (lidt) well so that no water can get in.***\n\n***Item take a large pan or cauldron with water, set it over the fire and let the container (drichlin) boil in it. Lay a stone on the container so the water covers it, and check often so it does not become too hard. When it is slightly firm, take the stone off the cover and take it out. Then put fat into a pan and let it heat up over the fire, Cut slices from the batter, they should be one finger long and one finger wide. Lay them into the fat and let them fry until the slices open up on top. When they have opened up, you must not shake the pan any more. The fat should not be too hot. If it becomes too hot, take it off the fire. Let it rise up (over the fritters) and then fry it nicely and slowly.***\n\nThis is interesting. The batter itself is not too different from the one for the bag-boiled fritters \u2013 a little richer, given it uses milk only \u2013 but the cooking container is fascinating. A square (literally \u2018four-cornered\u2019) tin with a lid that closes tightly enough to keep out water and is wide and flat anough to be held submerged by a stone placed on top. I am not sure what associates it with Nuremberg, but it is possible the link is with the fame of Nuremberg\u2019s metalsmiths and craftspeople who would find making such a thing easy.\n\nAnother point of interest is the word *barschon en*. Hayer reads this as persons, but I wonder whether it is not a phonetic rendering of portions, maybe from Italian or French.

It is better to do this with your hand. When you want to break the eggs into it, dry them off beforehand so no water can drip off the eggs into the dough. Make this dough smooth and stiff like wax with your hand. Do not make it too thin. If you want to lay it in (the fat), tilt the pan If the dough flows a little, it is proper. Take a piece of dough as big as a hen\u2019s egg with an iron spoon and lay it into hot fat, but not too hot. Let them fry slowly, and when they open up, turn them over with the opening downwards, and shake the pan.***\n\n***106 Mortar fritters in a different way***\n\n***Take a querttlin (about a cup) of water and boil it. Add a little fat and salt, and when it boils, stir in flour and dry it well over the fire. Put it into a mortar and pound it with eggs until it is like a dough for byette kiechla (choux pastry). Then lay it into hot fat with an iron spoon into fat that is not too hot and let them fry gently.***\n\n***107 Another way to fry mortar fritters***\n\n***Take milk worth a pfennig and as much water, let it boil and add a piece of fat the size of a walnut. When it is boiling, sprinkle in good spelt flour (keren mel) until it becomes very thick and dry. Let it dry slowly over the fire. Then put it into a mortar and pound the lumps to pieces. Then break in one egg after another until it becomes rather soft, but thicker than a streybla (Strauben fritter) batter. Break the eggs into it when they are quite cool. If you handle them right, they will turn out well and be as large as a semel loaf.***\n\nDespite sharing a name with the ever popular [mortar cakes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/29/mortar-cake-from-the-konigsberg-ms/), they are not at all the same thing. Their name *kiechla* is a dialectal variant and diminutive of *kuchen(n)*, a word that had a much wider meaning then than it does today, and though it strictly means \u201csmall cake\u201d, in the Welser collections it always refers to a fritter. Here, the mortar is not the cooking vessel, but used to prepare the batter. It is needed to breask up the lumps in the choux pastry as the egg is mixed in, a tedious but necessary process.\n\nThe three variants here are, again, very closely related, one being made with a mixture of milk and water and using spelt flour spoecifically, the others using fat and water. The first recipe has more detailed instructions, but we can assume that they apply to the other ones as well. As the dough is passed into the fat, it is meant to rise and expand, tearing open its already cooked surface, and a careful cook will turn it over to expose the raw dough emerging to hot fat directly to cook it evenly and prevent it becoming misshapen. We do not know howe big the spoon used to transfer it into the fat would have been, but a *semel* loaf was a substantial breadroll, so it does not seem out of place to think the expansion similar to our *vol-au-vents*. That would have been quite a spectacular trick.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg.

While it mentions technical applications for pig products, its main focus lies on food. Pigs were kept primarily for eating.\n\nThe defense of the pig whose squealing seems to have annoyed people begins with a mention of lebersoln. I am not fully sure what these are, but I suspect it is a reference to the frequently attested [roasted ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/22/a-stuffed-liver-roasted-in-a-caul-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[mashed ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/16/liver-wrapped-in-caul-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)[liver ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/12/liver-roasted-in-caul-from-meister-eberhard/)[wrapped ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/05/liver-in-a-caul-from-cgm-384-ii/)in a [caul](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/15/another-liver-in-a-caul-recipe/). That certainly seems to have been a popular and exclusive dish. Sausages, made with brain, [liver](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/23/experiments-in-sausage-making-iii-renaissance-liver-sausage/), blood, or sheer meat, are specifically addressed as four main types. This seems to be a mental classification that was current. We have surviving recipes for blood sausages, [liver sausages](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/29/two-sausage-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/), and the [high-status bratwurst](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/22/experiments-in-sausage-making-ii-bratwurst-after-sabina-welser/) made from muscle meat. Some surviving recipes involving brain, too, may describe sausages, but I am less confident in identifying those. The poem does not mention [lung](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/03/a-lung-sausage-from-cgm-384-ii/) [sausages](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/21/experiments-in-sausage-making-i-lung-sausage-after-rheinfrankisches-kochbuch/), a type we have several surviving recipes for. That may be owed to local custom, personal dislike, lack of status, or any other reason you care to imagine. Certainly people ate every part of the pig, and [sausage making](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=sausages+rontzier) was a [creative discipline](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/19/pork-sausages-from-de-rontzier/).\n\nNext, the poem mentions roast pork and the joy of eating the drippings with bread \u2013 *betreift sniten* possibly placed under the roast during cooking, though in my opinion more likely spread on toasted slices or loaves afterwards. I can attest to the fact that this is delicious. The feet, snout, ears and tail are cooked in a galantine. This is harder to interpret than it seems because the [various words](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/08/jelly-by-yet-another-name/) used to describe jelly today[ could refer to gelatin](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/08/medieval-gelatin-powder-and-the-next-book-project/), but also to thickened sauces at the time. Clearly, though, these fiddly meat bits were cooked, taken apart, and served in an accressible and highly seasoned form.\n\nThe next section addresses bacon (speck), a useful ingredient in all kinds of dishes. This could refer to anything from mostly meaty salt-cured pork belly to mostly fat, white R\u00fcckenspeck. Interpreting individual recipes can be fraught that way, but it is likely cooks chose what they found served best. One especially interesting note is the poet\u2019s injunction that boiled chicken must always be served with bacon and parsley (here likely meaning the root boiled with the meat). There may be the germ of a recipe in this line. Pig fat is also used as a cooking medium, which provides the connection to [pancakes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/26/a-pancake-dish-from-cgm-384-ii/)and the[ broad class](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/15/fritters-from-the-tegernsee-list/) of *krepfelin* fritters. The word usually means a filled fritter like a dumpling, but is often used for other kinds of fritter as well. The lardons (grieben) produced when [rendering lard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/28/preserving-schmalz-meat-preservation-part-7/) were another way of adding meaty richness to non-meat dishes, [served with porridges and vegetable purees](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/01/fake-chopped-meat-and-cracklings-for-lent/).\n\nTwo social practices are mentioned as asides: Pork shoulders and ham, probably dry-salted and smoked, are served to nursing mothers and fat kraut, most likely a cabbage dish, [at weddings](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/22/wittenwilers-wedding-feast-vi-kraut/). We have other mentions of this and it seems to have been a custom early on. Addiong bacon to fish while culinarily plausible seems a daring suggestion given that fish was mainly eaten during Lent. It would not be a problem on meat days, obviously, so such recipes likely existed, but to find it stated as common practice in a clerical environment is a slight surprise.\n\nWhat follows is a list of technical applications: Pigskin used in aprons razor, strops, helmet straps, and all kinds of other roles, pig fat for greasing leather, and bristles for sewing, in brushes, and in holy water sprinklers, the noblest avocation a humble pig could aspire to. Interestingly, we also learn that drinking glasses, still a luxury item, were kept clean using brushes. This kind of detail makes reading the K\u00f6nig\u2019s poems so rewarding.\n\nDer K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald (literally king of the Odenwald, a mountain chain in southern Germany) is an otherwise unknown poet whose work is tentatively dated to the 1340s. His title may refer to a senior rank among musicians or entertainers, a Spielmannsk\u00f6nig, but that is speculative. Many of his poems are humorous and deal with aspects of everyday life which makes them valuable sources to us today.\n\nThe identity of this poet has been subject to much speculation. He is clearly associated with the episcopal court at W\u00fcrzburg and likely specifically with Michael de Leone (c. 1300-1355), a lawyer and scholar. Most of his work is known only through the Hausbuch of the same Michael de Leone, a collection of verse and practical prose that also includes the first known instance of the Buoch von guoter Spise, a recipe collection. This and the evident relish with which he describes food have led scholars to consider him a professional cook and the author of the Buoch von Guoter Spise, but that is unlikely. Going by the content of his poetry, the author is clearly familiar with the lives of the lower nobility and even his image of poverty is genteel. This need not mean he belonged to this class, but he clearly moved in these circles to some degree. Michael de Leone, a secular cleric and canon on the W\u00fcrzburg chapter, was of that class and may have been a patron of the poet. Reinhardt Olt whose edition I am basing my translation on assumes that the author was a fellow canon, Johann II von Erbach.\n\nI only translate the poems that deal with aspects of food or related everyday life here. There are several others which are less interesting as sources. They can be found in the newest extant edition by Reinhard Olt, K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald; Gedichte, Carl Winter Verlag, Heidelberg 1988.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cv5r15/in_praise_of_the_pig_c_1340/", "created_utc": 1716062153.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cv5r15/in_praise_of_the_pig_c_1340/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Chicken with bacon and parsley is essentially the description of the \"Icelandic chicken\" recipe in Cariadoc's Miscellany - it's delicious!"]}

Then make a dough of second quality flour  and take two eggs and a little melted fat and warm water. Make an  elastic dough from that and roll it out in one large sheet or two,  depending on how much venison there is. Fold one over the other when the  venison is in it and make a wreath around it or otherwise close it  neatly, as women know how to save (wyes fraw retten kan). Brush  it with egg all over and put it into the tart pan and bake it slowly  for three hours.

Poke 5 holes in the top and let it bake for 4 hours.***\n\nWith just pepper and salt, larding, and wine and vinegar as a cooking  liquid, these recipes have a very contemporary feel. The instructions  in recipe #64 to enclose the meat between two sheets of dough and then  place it in a tart pan suggests the pastries were not very large. This  would simply not be feasible with anything much bigger that a standard  pie. The flavours work well together, but it is all rather  unadventurous, even with the ginger and cloves added in #66.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

{"title": "Walnut-Cheese Stuffed Roast (c. 1280)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/10/walnut-cheese-stuffing-experiment/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/10/walnut-cheese-stuffing-experiment/)\n\n I had the time to try out something I came across[ a while ago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/03/walnut-stuffed-roasts-from-the-marvels-of-milan/).  A half sentence in the Marvel of Milan, a praise poem by Bonvesin de la  Riva on the extensive virtues of the city, describes an interesting use  for walnuts: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lqf7dvkbknc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=043efb581c7b268a5f7b07d73421e770cdc18b1c\n\n***Also almonds, may I say a little about this, wild  hazelnuts, walnuts in incredible quantity, which are enjoyed all through  the year and all citizens delight in them after any meal/dish (post omnia ferculla). They  are also added, ground up, to cheese and eggs and pepper with which  meat is filled in wintertime. There is also oil (made) of them which  flows richly for us.***\n\nThis mixture intrigued me, and I got myself some walnut meats and  Rouladen beef for rolling up to try a few versions in manageable portion  sizes. My first question was what to do about the eggs. Since there are  [recipes including boiled egg in stuffings for roasts](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/stuffed-roast-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)  from later years, I opted for hard-boiled egg processed with the nuts  and cheese rather than raw to bind the mixture. The next variable to  address was the choice of cheese, and I decided to make two stuffings  with grated Padano cheese and one with mozzarella to see how they would  perform. I do not think either is a very plausible candidate  historically, but similarly fresh or aged cheeses would have been  available. Processed into a paste with plenty of pepper, they produced a  credible filling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zawcgqrnbknc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=943b7cabe51ec514ff4c2208df1cc511dc7a88f8\n\n I do not have evidence for this, but for sheer curiosity I wanted to see  how this filling would work with green herbs. This turned out to be  completely superfluous because the flavour of the cheese and nuts  overpowered them almost completely. Something stronger, though, perhaps  green garlic, would certainly harmonise well. Given the hostility of the  upper classes to anything that made your breath smell, though, I do not  think this is likely. The rich, smooth consistency I got very likely  was what the recipe aims for.   \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2ez9qdqbknc1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6824e2da6bd0a1e28815abf0bc45f44dcea4fb2a\n\nI spread the stuffing on the Rouladen beef and rolled it up, then  cooked them at a low temperature to soften them. The meat turned out  pleasantly tender, most likely because of the oil and fat from the  cheese and nuts preventing it from drying out. Today, we tend to use  bacon for this. It was also pleasantly tast, rich and unctuous. I had  added some chestnuts to the mix because Bonvesin de la Riva[ also mentions them](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/04/chestnuts-in-the-marvels-of-milan/):\n\n***Green (fresh), they are cooked in the fire and are eaten  after other foods in place of dates, and in my estimation they give a  better flavour than dates.

Today, sixteenth century pine nut tarts. First by  Philippine Welser: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48witn9396mc1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68817707169395e3382027606eb9a7436eb49b9d\n\n***44 If you want to make a pine nut tart***\n\n***Take pine nuts, soak them and then clean them. Add sugar, cinnamon, and raisins and put it on the tart base. Prepare a crust (blad) on top and cut it, and when it is half baked, pour fat on it and let it bake fully.***\n\nPine nuts belong to a set of fashionable luxury goods imported from  the Mediterranean in the sixteenth century. Like lemons, oranges, and  Parmesan cheese, they aided in imitating an Italian lifestyle aspired to  by the very wealthy. They are not native to Germany. Thus, despite the  simplicity, this is a very luxurious recipe. It is not easy to read how  this would turn out because much depends on proportions and cooking  techniques. The related recipe in Marx Rumpolt does not clarify much:\n\n***41 Also make a tart of pine nuts (piuni), small black raisins mixed in, and made nicely sweet.***\n\n(p. clxxviii v)\n\nGood pine nuts are quite soft and will not be hard or crunchy,  especially if the soaking takes place soon before adding them to the  tart. It is possible that this is simply meant to blanch them \u2013 remove  the brown skin covering the kernel \u2013  and they would be dried  beforehand, though. This will make a difference to the consistency, with  soaked nuts softening almost to a paste, especially if hot water was  used. I used to use them as a base for sauces in Roman recipes before  they were priced out of my range. \n\nThe next question is the quantity and consistency of the sugar being added. We have seen before that [clarified sugar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/11/clarifying-sugar/), which is called for in some recipes, was [used as ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/30/clarifying-sugar-after-walter-ryff/)[a thick liquid](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/16/clarifying-sugar-with-philippine-welser/).  This, added to soft nut meats in quantity, could easily produce  something akin to the beloved modern American pecan pie. Crystallised  sugar, on the other hand, is more likely to produce something crumbly  and dry. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of  Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The  recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely  produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have  been made at the request of her mother and was written by an  experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine  Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near  Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der  Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1b5pshg/pine_nut_tart_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1709494603.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1b5pshg/pine_nut_tart_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Then  take a piece the size of a walnut, sprinkle it well with flour, roll out  thin rounds (*****Plaetzlein*****) of that, lay them flat in butter and  fry them quickly, but not so they become brown. Then lift them out with a  skimmer and quickly strew them with salt on both sides.

For the  first batch, I pinched off walnut-sized pieces and rolled them out  separately, but my skill in shaping them was inadequate and I quickly  got frustrated with them. For the second half, I used round cookie  cutters. I tried different thicknesses, from about 4mm to as thin as I  could manage, and varied the frying temperature, and the best results  were achieved with fairly thin, round cut-out pieces at a gentler heat.  Fresh, they were crisp and intense, almost like proto-pringles.- Cold,  they were still attractive, but by now, after about six hours, they are  definitely turning leathery and stale.

{"title": "The Mixed-Up History of the Negroni", "selftext": "It's Negroni week, so I wanted to share this Diffords Guide article on the history of the Negroni along with my thoughts: [https://www.diffordsguide.com/g/1078/negroni-cocktail/negroni-story](https://www.diffordsguide.com/g/1078/negroni-cocktail/negroni-story)\n\nBefore I get into the Negroni, we should start with the Spritz. The Spritz, as the story goes, was invented when Austrian soldiers couldn't handle strong Italian wines and asked for a spritz of water to be added. This was later replaced by soda water as that became more popular. This story bares all the hallmarks of mythmaking and I'm at least a little skeptical that Italian wines would be so strong that Austrians could only drink it with water. But I'll defer to people more familiar with Spritzes on this one.\n\nThe cocktail was invented in the US in the late 18th or early 19th century. It wasn't the first mixed drink--punches, juleps, sours, toddies, and slings all exited, but they weren't called cocktails yet. The cocktail was essentially what we'd call an Old Fashioned. In the mid-19th century, Americans started to really experiment with the cocktail, adding maraschino, flavored syrups, and eventually vermouth. These drinks spread rapidly around the world, though there likely were domestic mixed drinks that became known as cocktails even though they have an independent origin (the gin & tonic or the gimlet, for example). In Italy, people started drinking a vermouth-Campari concoction known as a Milano-Torino. When soda water was added to this, it was dubbed the Americano. There is a story that Americans couldn't handle the strong drink and needed soda water to water it down (sound familiar). I'm even more skeptical of this one as Americans were drinking much stronger stuff and already had Campari and vermouth drinks. The other explanation given is that Americans were so strongly associated with mixed drinks that it got its name that way. \n\nOn a note about American drinks: Italian vermouth took off in America a decade or two after the Civil War (French vermouth came later). Those most enduring of these cocktails was the Manhattan. There's an old version of a Manhattan that's more than 50% vermouth. Bartenders also started experimenting by using Italian bitters instead of Angostura. In that process, the Camparianette was born. When I first read this [Elemental Mixology article](https://elementalmixology.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/the-camparinette-cocktail-and-the-negroni-cup/) on the history of the Negroni, I was convinced that what we call the Negroni was an American invention called the Camparinette and that the Negroni was originally a Spritz (more on that later). But we have more evidence now (more on that later) and I no longer think this is the case. First of all, we have a French drink called a Campari Mixte from 1929, but I also don't think that's the origin. I think it's likely that there were many independent inventions using Campari and playing with basic ratios.\n\nSo, what do I think is the origin? I think it's Italian, but it hadn't hit its final form yet. Originally, the Negroni was primarily a vermouth drink that was flavored with Campari and a few drops of gin. Here's a [Punch article](https://punchdrink.com/articles/negroni-cocktail-recipe-has-a-secret-history/) citing sources. As the years went on, the amount of gin increased (except during WWII when it was hard to find). By 1939, there was a version being served that was 2 parts vermouth to 1 part Campari and 1 part gin. In 1947, we find the oldest known reference to the equal parts cocktail. As for the Spritz version of a Negroni, I suspect some people just served them that way and it wasn't a universal recipe. Two people writing about their travel experiences in the 1950s does not mean that that was the original version of the drink and not just a fad.\n\nBy the 1980s, the Negroni was typically served in a highball glass and was favored by people who liked to get drunk. I haven't found recipes, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were some that were heavy on the gin. Finally, in the '90s and '00s, Campari made some advertising efforts to class up its reputation and embraced the equal parts Negroni recipe. Ever since then, the Negroni has become ubiquitous and there are many \"riffs\" on it that aren't really that similar to a Negroni. But we should keep them coming.\n\nAs for the Negroni Sbagliato, it wasn't a mistake. That was [branding](https://www.foodrepublic.com/2015/03/11/the-curious-evolution-of-the-americano/). It was invented in the late 1960s. The story goes that a staff member had put back prosecco where gin should be (not sure why it wasn't cold), but unlike the myth where it was accidentally mixed, it appears to have been intentionally mixed and presented as a \"mistake\" to appeal to people who wanted lighter cocktails.\n\nTL;DR: The Negroni started as a vermouth-based with some campari and less gin. It morphed into its current form by the late 1940s, but took a dark path during the dark days of mixology. Finally, in the '90s and '00s, corporate branding got it back on track as it was embraced by the retro cocktail revolution.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16oh3cx/the_mixedup_history_of_the_negroni/", "created_utc": 1695305826.0, "score": 8, "author": "pgm123", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16oh3cx/the_mixedup_history_of_the_negroni/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["thanks for this, it's fascinating"]}

Then  take fine bread and a little pepper, and three times as much caraway.  Grind it together with vinegar and with beer, add saffron, and pour off  the broth. Pour on the ground (sauce) and salt it in measure. Let it  boil up in the condiment sauce and serve it.***\n\nThe sauce described here is not unusual in any way. Spicy sauces   thickened with bread were known widely as pfeffer, pepper sauces, a word  we still find preserved in dishes like Hasenpfeffer. This is one of the  fairly rare instances of a  vegetable dish prepared with one, though.  The beans referred to here are, of course, fava beans, not the phaseolus  we call \u2018green beans\u2019 today. Those are New World cultivars. Other than  that, the recipe is straightforward and I look forward to trying it out.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

They are in size about half as thick  as a little finger. You can judge what their bodies would look like once  they were gutted and skinned, and how much fat and substance it could  provide to the herbs with which it is cooked. But it must be said that  those who look only for tenderness and ease of digestion in their meats  will surely find this here.***\n\n***About an hours before he was to take his meal, he lit his lamp and placed the chopped herbs into the*** **caffetiere** ***along  with as many anolis as he judged necessary to give his water and his  herbs the fat and juices required to turn it into a good broth (bouillon).  Some crushed grains of bois d\u2019Inde or some chili served him in place of  salt and spices. When this venerable dish was cooked, he poured out the  broth over manioc flour arranged on the leaf of a balisier. This was  his soup (potage) which at the same time served him as his  bread to eat his anolis, and since eating to fullness is dangerous in  hot climates, his caffetiere served him as both evening meal and  breakfast. Which both together never set him back more that two*** **sols** ***and six*** **deniers**.  ***It was carnival to him when he caught a frog, and it would serve him  for two days at least, such was the frugality of that man.\u201d***\n\nI am really not sure what to make of this story. On one hand, Labat  (who usually travelled with several servants and a supply of wine and  liquor) surely did not actually accompany this man into the forest, so  the story should be assumed to contain a degree of exaggeration. On the  other hand, the precise observation of trivial details suggests it has  some truth to it. Personally, I am above all fascinated by the  combination of traditional Native American survival techniques with  contemporary high technology. Surely, if YouTube had been invented, that  guy would have had a channel.\n\nAnd yes, you can make manioc porridge that way (I have) and you can  eat anolis (I haven\u2019t). And I am pretty sure there was more to the herbs  than picking whatever looked appetising, but expecting that kind of  knowledge to register with a member of the upper classes  may be asking  too much. I am grateful enough we have the story at all, for its sheer  weirdness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/164s86b/seventeenthcentury_jungle_survival_food/", "created_utc": 1693338226.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/164s86b/seventeenthcentury_jungle_survival_food/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

And while it boils, you should  stir it strongly. Afterwards, put it into a pot while it is hot and add  the mustard flour until it is so thick that the spoon will stand in it.  Then cover it with a crust of bread and close it well, leave it standing  overnight on a stove or behind one*** (**uf der helle** ***\u2013 in the gap  between stove and wall). Then it ferments like a dough. Afterwards, set  it in a place where it will neither freeze nor yet stand too hot, and if  you would eat of it, take it out with a spoon and stir it with wine.***\n\nThe recipe itself is not really complex \u2013 mix wine and honey, stir in  ground mustardseed. We even get a reasonable idea of proportions,  though how much honey goes into the wine (or wine into the honey?)  remains unanswered. The resulting thick mash is stored in a warm place  (the gap between the stove and the wall was used for such purposes in  many South German homes) until it ferments \u2013 whatever this process looks  like in practice. Depending on the proportion of honey to wine, I  suppose some form of alcoholic fermentation would be possible.  Afterwards, it can be kept for later use and diluted in wine.\n\nThis recipe seems to have some things in common with the more frequently attested [cinnamon honey mustard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/28/cinnamon-honey-mustard-from-meister-hans/) which is also [meant for long-term storage](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/14/instant-honey-mustard-from-cgm-384-i/).  It may be a more plebeian version, or the unrecorded proportions may  have varied so much the result would be very different.  Certainly it is  an interesting thing to note and though I do not have time  to play  with it properly right now, I will keep it in mind.\n\nOne of the most extensive and interesting medieval recipe  collections in German is a manuscript dated 1460 and ascribed to one  Meister Hans, cook at the Wurttemberg court. It was often treated as a  solitary, the work of a single cook, but there are too many parallels  with contemporary manuscripts from Southern Germany to make this  plausible.

{"title": "A Complicated Fritter (c. 1450)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/19/two-complicated-fritters-from-the-innsbruck-ms/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/19/two-complicated-fritters-from-the-innsbruck-ms/)\n\n I am not entirely sure how these work, but they are fascinating: \n\n \n\n***68 If you would make filled sheets of eggs, take eggs and  beat the whites separately. Take a little fat into a pan, only enough  to cover the bottom, and pour the eggs into it. Make very thin sheets  and also make sheets from the yolks. Spread the sheets (with) roast  apples or with raisins or figs and then roll them over each other (*****welig si dann uber ein ander*****) and cut them like fatty sausage (***[**rosen wurst**](https://www.wurst.de/tradition/druckanekdote.php?id=wurstichitaet&descr=Die%20Wurstichit%E4t)***).  Stick 4 or 5 of them on a skewer of wood. Prepare a batter and roll  them in it, then fry them, withdraw the skewers, and cut them open  lengthwise.***\n\n***69 If you would make filled slices (*****gefult sniten*****) in this manner, lay one slice atop the other. If you spread them (*****bestreichst*****), use four (apiece). Also fry the in the same manner and also cut them open into pieces (*****snitzen*****) etc.***\n\nThis recipe is not only interesting in itself, but also for vwhat it  tells us about the ubiquitous Bl\u00e4tter, the sheets variously described at  times as of egg or of dough, but usually left undefined. Here, they are  made of egg only, the whites and yolks separated, and I wonder how  strongly the whites would have been beaten. The principle of turning egg  whites into a froth was understood, but it is not attested for culinary  use this early. Given the sheets are specifically described as thin, I  suspect they are made of liquid egg white. \n\nThe filling is very likely cooked into a homogenous mass. With  apples, this was typically done with honey and spices, raisins were  cooked in wine until they were soft enough to mash. This could be spread  even on thin and fairly fragile egg pancakes. Up to here, the recipe is  clear. What I have yet to fully understand is how they are then rolled  up and sliced, but I suspect we basically stack up pancakes, roll them  into a long sausage and cut it into slices that are then skewered across  their diameter. Knowing how one usually cut a rosen wurst, a sausage  made with the rib meat of pork, would probably make this clearer.  \n\nThe whole skewer is then dipped in a  batter and fried. The  description of rolling them in it suggests it was a fairly thick, heavy  batter that would produce a solid, crisp crust. The resulting fritter  would thus hold its shape as the skewer is withdrawn and the whole cut  apart in the middle to reveal the spiral structure with its complex  colours \u2013 white, yellow, brown or green, and likely a golden crust all  around. I can absolutely see the appeal. \n\nThe second recipe for *sniten*, slices, is a bit more  enigmatic. These may be bread slices, but that is not certain. If they  are, they would have to be cut fairly thin  and I suspect there was no  way of actually rolling them, so they would just be stacked. It is then a  simplified, cut-rate version of the first.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

{"title": "Shaggy Porridge - Medieval Milk Pasta", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/23/shaggy-mus-milk-pasta/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/23/shaggy-mus-milk-pasta/)\n\nToday\u2019s recipe from the Innsbruck MS is part of an interesting  tradition, and it illustrates why names mean relatively little when you are researching German recipes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gx3imr57ova1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec9ede64d84c2935456ae44fd79a899e7bee84dc\n\n***25 If you would make a shaggy Mus (zottet m\u00fcez),  make sheets of dough that are thin, and then cut them so they are as  small as small rings. Fry them in fat so they are not very brown and  then cook them in good milk. Serve it and add fat etc.***\n\nRecipes for *zottet* or *zotten* (shaggy) *Mus* show up repeatedly, and they are broadly similar. It has become one of my  standby dishes for camp cookery and features in the [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook).  The one from the Innsbruck MS, though, stands out for frying the dough  before cooking it in milk. Compare the parallel recipe (#150) in the  broadly contemporary Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***Take good white flour and make a dough with egg white.  Have boiling milk ready in a pan and pull the dough into little pieces,  throwing them in as the milk boils. It is to be salted beforehand. Also  add fat. See that it stays worm-shaped. Do not oversalt it. Serve it.***\n\nNote also that the pasta (here made with only egg whites) is pulled  apart and shaped by hand in this case. Meanwhile, the recipe that  Balthasar Staindl (#64) gives about a century later has it  chopped into  something much like orzo:\n\n***Make a dough of eggs, roll it out firmly and chop it up.  You must always dust it with a little flour while you chop it as small  as rice grains. Place them apart for a while so they can dry.Then cook  it in boiling milk, make it yellow if you want, boil it till it thickens  and serve it.***\n\nThere is a certain similarits to these recipes that does support them  bearing the same name. Egg pasta boiled in milk, giving the whole an  irregular, \u201cshaggy\u201d, appearance, is known as a *zotten* Mus. One  would be tempted to see the development from hand-pulled noodles to  finely chopped, dried dough as technical progress, but [there is a fifteenth-century recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/27/milk-pasta-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) that closely parallels Staindl\u2019s:\n\n***A dish of eggs***\n\n**Make a good** ***mus*** **of eggs thus: Take four eggs and  flour and chop that together, and see that there is not too little of  the flour so that it can be chopped. And when it is small, put it into  hot milk and do not make it too thick or too thin. Add a good amount of  fat and strew sugar on it, and do not oversalt it.**\n\nThis dish in Cod Pal Germ 551 is not referred to as zotten Mus. That  is interesting, but not  unusual. Names  in the German tradition are  often descriptive and can be applied quite flexibly. The dish described  in the Innsbruck MS shares certain features with the other *zotten Mus* ones, but it is also related to a number of recipes for Mus made from boiled fritters. Indeed, it keeps this company:\n\n***28 If you would make a*** **Mus** ***of strauben fritters (strauben muz), chop the strauben and cook a*** **Mus** ***with them. If you wish, pound the strauben and pass them through with wine and prepare the*** **Mus** ***with spices, the thickness of a*** **Mus** ***of pounded chickens etc.***\n\n***29 If you would make a*** **Mus** ***of pounded*** **chuchlein** ***fritters, prepare it like the*** **strauben Mus**, ***with spices.***\n\nI am not entirely sure what the exact difference between *chuchlein* and *strauben* is, but both are fried and therefore will introduce the kind of Maillard flavours that seem to be the point of these recipes.\n\nThe name *zotten*/*zottet Mus* does not survive for long, but the [class of dishes continues](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/07/milk-pasta-from-the-oeconomia/) with various designations. Today, [Milchnudeln ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milchnudeln)are considered a dessert dish, but the tradition is very much alive.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

This one is  definitely in no way peasant food, but it was occasioned by  availability. I had the giblets and neck of a duck in the freezer, and  we were making yeast dough anyway. Thus, the 1490 Kuchenmaistrey: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9ihfb1uiaua1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66fbfc53e676279efa143736d18f04832e569ca8\n\n***3. xiiii. Item you may fill krapfen with the filling you fill into inverted eggs (gest\u00fcrtzt ayer) or into apples or chickens. But if you wish to fill them with meat, all manner of meat or fish filling must be well and properly boiled beforehand. Be it gamebirds (walt vogel) or spleen, lungs, liver, or such small things, add other ingredients wisely and chop it and pound it well in a mortar with whatever you add; of eggs, of pears, or of parsley and other fragrant herbs of which you only take a small amount each for the filling, solely for the savour (des geschmacks wegen). Or you may be counseled (to make) a smal filling (? od\\[e\\] man mag sein geraten zu kleiner f\u00fcll). For without that, if you make fillings for roast chickens or pigeons whatever meat there be, you must have the good herbs with that and juniper berries pounded with caraway and fennelseed and mixed with the filling. Knead it well with raw eggs, fill it in and fry it well.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ybdm52fviaua1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18bc0c631c9a63957c43c66bf56f7867ca12d287\n\nThis really isn\u2019t a recipe so much as a list of notes on a type of dish, but it gives us an idea of how to go about it: Basically anything can go into meat krapfen, which are a kind of dough pockets enclosing any kind of filling. However, meat must be cooked beforehand, bound with raw egg, and seasoned strongly. All of that makes sense. Raw meat in a dough wrapping will not cook fully before the outside starts to burn, so doing that would be a bad idea. The filling will tend to fall apart when you bite into it, so binding it is advisable. And a leavened dough wrapper requires a strongly flavoured filling. \n\n This is really not much of an experiment, more a matter of getting  practice. After all, there isn\u2019t much that can go wrong here. I boiled  the duck pieces in lightly salted water, chopped the meat, mixed it with  egg and spices, wrapped it in leavened dough and fried it. Unless you  badly misjudge the temperature or cooking time, you are guaranteed to  end up with an easy, universally palatable dish. We eventually baked  some of them to save on cooking time, but they are really much better  from the pan.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12ok596/duck_krapfen_experiment_1490/", "created_utc": 1681670038.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12ok596/duck_krapfen_experiment_1490/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

A[ recipe in Meister Eberhard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/10/walnut-mus-from-meister-eberhard/) that is similar, though not identical, uses milk: \n\n***To make a good*** **mus**\n\n***Take nut kernels (*****nu\u00df kernn*****) and pound them small and pass them through a cloth with sweet milk.

{"title": "How Not to Set a Table (c. 1410)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/15/wittenwilers-wedding-feast-ii-setting-the-table/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/15/wittenwilers-wedding-feast-ii-setting-the-table/)\n\n Another brief excerpt from Wittenwiler\u2019s [Der Ring](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_(Lehrgedicht)): Setting up the tables for the feast: \n\n \n\n[ Eating al fresco was not unknown for the upper classes, as seen in the livre de la chasse of Gaston III of Foix, courtesy of wikimedia commons ](https://preview.redd.it/m238f6v3myna1.jpg?width=2630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6da81f127778662ff229418fd4d94016237c6ddb)\n\n***By now, people should have danced, but the feet could not  carry them for hunger. That is why four who would serve at the table  went away and said they wanted a soup as was the custom. This was done  straight away.***\n\n***One of them was so gluttonous that he almost died of  scalding his throat. He jumped up immediately and banged his fist on the  table so that the soup and the bread fell to the ground. Each of them  said: \u201cBefore I starve, I will pick up the broth from the dirt. And it  it were even shittier (*****noch bass beschissen*****) \u2013 no bite will be left lying.\u201d In truth, this happened! They enjoyed it.***\n\n***Then each took a sack and spread it out on the grass.  Behold, what a lovely tablecloth! It was washed at least once a year for  certain. Pitchers served for cups and glasses, so big they could hardly  be lifted. They would have had salt and saltcellars if they had thought  of them. There were no knives and no cut bread. They brought loaves of  barley and of oats \u2013 they called for these \u2013 and also laid out rye  bread. Thus was the table set.***\n\nThis scene sets the tone for the rest of the feast: crass and  unbelievably disgusting. The setup here \u2013 dirty sacks spread on the bare  soil with only pitchers to drink from and no salt or sauces. It is not  entirely improbable that peasants ate like this, but the way  it is  described makes it a mockery of upper-class tables. Oat and barley bread  \u2013 the least desirable kind, often produced as feed for horses or dogs  rather than people \u2013 are served by popular demand, along with the more  acceptable rye. Basically, the table lacks the amenities that make  proper dining possible. By contrast, consider what an anonymous 1492  poem describes (quoted after Bach: The Kitchen, Food and Cooking in  Reformation Germany, chapter 5):\n\n***Do not be tardy in setting the table, diligently lay the cloth all around it. Do not forget the saltcellar, and place the*** **sch\u00fcsselrink**  ***(a ring-shaped coaster to hold the serving bowl in place) in the  center. Put down a plate for each diner and the spoons in pairs. Place  bread, rye and white, together, give it with each plate.***\n\nThe table is set on a tablecloth \u2013 clean, of course. It  covers not  only the top, but the sides (there is some dispute on how this was  achieved, whether there was one or more lengths of fabric). Salt is a  must, as is bread, in this case rye and wheat. Each diner receives a  plate. That was a relatively new idea at the time \u2013 before, sharing  plates between two had been customary. Knives and spoons are the  implements of choice, forks as yet very uncommon. That is the picture  against which we contrast the mud-smeared servants arranging sloshing  pitchers on dirty sacks. \n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem \u201aDer Ring\u2018 (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself to  translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners, but  would advise anyone with enough command of German to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11s7mig/how_not_to_set_a_table_c_1410/", "created_utc": 1678910767.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11s7mig/how_not_to_set_a_table_c_1410/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Distracting things going on, so I may again miss out on a  few postings. Have a lengthy instruction on healthy living from  Wittenweiler\u2019s early fifteenth-century poem [Der Ring](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_(Lehrgedicht)) to make up for the disappointment: \n\n \n\n[ Front page of Wittenwiler\u2019s poem Der Ring courtesy of wikimedia commons  \\(and yes, I think Bertschi, the dapper fellow on the left, is doing  exactly what it looks like he\u2019s doing.

That is why I will  not tell you how to stay healthy. My art and my pharmacy would otherwise  be ruined.\u201d***\n\n***Bertschi said: \u201cYou are a villain who only looks to his pennies. See, here you have three old*** **haller*****, now tell me fully what it is like.\u201d***\n\n***Then the physician reconsidered and began his teachings  thus: \u201cNo medicine was ever as good as this: Guard against too little  and too much. Health demands moderation. Especially be keen to have  good, clean air, neither too hot nor too cold. If the wind is too harsh,  you need many silken, linen or cotton garments that are tightly woven (*****dick*****)  and well made. Air is also good for sleeping people, that is why it is  wrong to sleep where no air can reach you. But if you live at ground  level and the earth is moist, guard yourself in winter with a bright  fire that gives you heat. In summer, open the door so the moisture may  escape and air enter. The chamber must also be sufficiently strewn with  herbs that must not be mossy or waterlogged.\u201d***\n\n***\u201cThe second that is good for health depends on the work  that a person does. Thus know, the wise man speaks: A man who does  little work must have light foods. But we advise those who move about  much and work hard also must eat substantially (*****grosseu speis er haben wil*****).  Know that it is better for you if you walk before eating than if you  sit, but do it without tiring yourself out. This frees you from  superfluous matter. After eating, you may stand or walk about a little.  That is always good until the food has settled.\u201d***\n\n***\u201cThe third thing that nature demands is washing and  bathing. You shall remember that we distinguish two kinds of bath: the  sweating bath (*****swaisspad*****) and the water bath (*****wasserpad*****).  Have a sweating bath prepared when you have superfluous matter between  the flesh and skin. The water bath, prepared with noble herbs, lukewarm  and not too hot, makes you pretty and chubby (faiss). Always keep warm  while bathing if you value your body. You shall wash your head at most  once a week, thus you are acting correctly, but at least once a month  without protest, that is the custom. The feet, I believe, should be  washed frequently and very thoroughly with lukewarm water. You should  always wash on an empty stomach. Thus you have heard the third.\u201d***\n\n***\u201cFourth you shall know that food serves you better when  you are hungry than at any other time. But do not fill your stomach  entirely full! Leave a little empty space in your stomach so the food  can be better digested. If you do not wish to rue your meal, you must  chew it well and thoroughly. Many courses will cause you suffering, they  sap your strength and vigour. But if you will not forgo them, partake  of the second dish right after the first, with no pause. Observe the  rule in eating that the coarsest comes first, and take the most tender  food last, unless it is soft fruit like cherries, figs, or raisins \u2013  these must be served first. After the meal, my rule says, harder fruit  is served that press down the food. Those are peaches, good pears, and  other foods that have the same effect. Cheese after meat and nuts after  fish shall be served to us at every table.\u201d***\n\n***The fifth is that one must drink to quench thirst. Know  that I mean proper thirst that affects the healthy after eating only,  not before, through the heat in the esophagus. And what manner of  drinking should there be? Moderate, not too extensive, white and clear  or ros\u00e9 in summer, and not too heavy. In winter, you may drink a glass  of strong red wine. And if it is sweet and well-tasting, it is pleasing  to your stomach. Also believe that a new, clear, and fine wine is much  better than the old. But if your stomach is too cold, drink some*** **hohen wein** ***(Mediterranean  luxury wines) in the morning, that will help. But I beseech you, if you  wish to be healthy, above all avoid adulterated wine (*****gmachten wein*****).\u201d***\n\n***\u201cThe sixth is what we all need: It is sleep, which nature  has ordained for us to rest. But if you have just filled yourself with  food, do not succumb to sleep like a beast, even though the desire  overcomes you. You must oppose it with pleasant activity, with sitting,  walking, or standing, until sleep overcomes you a second time. Then it  is healthy to sleep in complete quiet until you eye is without  sleepiness. Then seek to rise and go to stool, and relieve yourself of  your water. You shall also cough and clear your throat, wash quickly,  and throw out all dirtiness (*****unflat*****). Comb your head, scratch  your limbs, and clean your ears. But if it pleases you to sleep in  daytime, especially in summer, lie down without worry where it (the air)  is freshest and it is dark, without shoes and under a blanket. You  shall also know that the head must be covered better while sleeping than  while waking. First, you shall only lie down on your right-hand side.  Nobody praises sleeping on your back, when the head hangs down in the  straw. Those whose stomachs have become cold may lie on their bellies.\u201d***\n\n***\u201cThe seventh thing that serves your health is a joyful heart. That is why everyone must guard against dismay (*****ungem\u00fcet*****) and anger (*****zorn*****)  that burns the blood. Dismay dries and anger consumes, and both harden  flesh and bone. But a little anger can be quite good if it freshens the  blood. Fire also serves this purpose, for it gives us joy and aids our  lives. But do not turn towards it, because it harms your eyes. And if  you become too warm from it, it will rob you of your vigour.\u201d***\n\n***\u201cFinally, know one thing from me: What a man loves to  sing from the joy of his heart, that is his song. What he joyfully  drinks is his drink. What he likes to eat is his food. That is why the  wise man tells us: Voluptuousness and custom thwart our abilities and  our proper living.

Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature.

Item fritters of wafers (*****oblaten*****) make  thus: Take figs and raisins, boil them, and chop them small. Season it  with spices and saffron, add salt, and temper it well. Take one wafer  and spread (*****zen{\\[e\\]r}g*****) the figs on it and set another wafer on it. Dredge this through a batter of white flour and fry them nicely.***\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/liq7ac4mdzka1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90585b2d65f45fa3fe43be74922ef9ce57b1bb34\n\n*Oblaten*, thin wafers, were probably more substantial then  than they are now, but we still use them in German cuisine. They mainly  serve as a base for lebkuchen and macaroons and look a bit like edible  paper. I used storebought this time and they worked nicely. The filling  was dried figs and raisins parboiled in water and pureed. I added actual  saffron, but I do not think it did anything. The other spices \u2013  cinnamon, ginger, cloves and  nutmeg, with a pinch of salt \u2013 dominated  completely. Dipped in a batter of egg and flour and quickly fried in  oil, they turned out lovely once they had cooled down a bit.  \n\nInterestingly, though the practice is quite uncommon these days, it  survived as an idea well into the modern era. Katharina Prato\u2019s very  influential *S\u00fcddeutsche K\u00fcche* (quoting from the 50th edition, Vienna 1912) describes a very similar preparation:\n\n**Oblaten-Krapferl** ***(wafer  fritters). With wine batter. Cut  wafers into rounds, brush them with egg, fill each two and two with  cherry flesh, dip them in wine batter, fry them in fat and strew them  with  sugar.*** \n\n***With choux paste: You place small heaps of firm rosehip sauce (*****Hagebuttensalse*****)  on wafers cut square, cover them with wafers cut to the same shape, and  only press them together slightly in the middle so that a space remains  between the wafers where there is no sauce. Dip the four corners of the  wafers into choux paste thinned with eggs to fill the interstices and  fry them in fat. The sauce should shine red through the yellowish cooked  wafer, the edges be light brown.*** \n\nThis is interesting and really sounds very attractive. I may want to  try it out at some point. It also suggests that the various wafer  fritters in the medieval and early modern corpus may well hide something   more technically and visually sophisticated than what I produced.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11ehflj/wafer_fritters_c_1490/", "created_utc": 1677612475.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11ehflj/wafer_fritters_c_1490/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

This is the entry on maize (*Zea mays*) in [Leonhart Fuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhart_Fuchs) 1543 New Kre\u00fcterbuch:\n\n***Of Turkish Corn  (*****T\u00fcrckischem Korn*****)***\n\n***Names: The present plant  was also recently  brought to  us from Turkey, Asia, and Greece, which is why it is called Turkish corn  (*****T\u00fcrckisch korn*****). It has not been called anything other than*** **Turcicum frumentum** ***in Latin.*** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n['Turkish corn' in the New Kre\u00fcterbuch courtesy of wikimedia commons](https://preview.redd.it/da141xy5ftga1.jpg?width=2634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96e803040f4a8107cf684ff9fd8ee621bc060689)\n\n ***Its Kinds: There are  four kinds of Turkish corn. One with  brown grains, one with red (*****rotlechtem*****) ones, one with yellow ones, and one with white ones. They also differ in the ears (*****aehern*****)  which, though they are all pointy, flower in various colours according  to the colour of the grain they produce, one brown, the other red, and  so forth. Otherwise they are identical to each other which is why we  have incorporated them all into one painting and figure.*** \n\n***Its Appearance: Turkish corn produces very tall stalks or stems (*****helm oder stengel*****) which are round, thick, and brown towards the root, with many knots or nodes (*****knoepffen oder gewerben*****). The  leaves are long, similar to those of reeds (*****scharpffen Ried oder Rhorblettern*****).  It produces ears on the stalks, but these are pointy and entirely empty  for they produce no seeds. They  flower like rye, sometimes brown,  sometimes red, sometimes white or yellow, according to the grain they  produce. The grains are triangular and lie enclosed in large, round  sheaths of grass that are shaggy (*****auszotteten*****) at the top and  emerge from the sides of the stalks. These grains are also pressed close  together and sometimes a  sheath contains eight rows, sometimes ten,  rarely more. The shaggy hair that grows on top of the grass sheaths has  the same colour as the grain that is enclosed within. The root is  comprised of many small hairs.***  \n\n***Place of Cultivation: As stated above, this grain was  first brought to our country from Turkey. They thrive here, as they are  now almost common and are counted in many gardens.*** \n\n***Season: Turkish corn must be sown in spring, mainly in April, but in our lands it only ripens in autumn.*** \n\n***Its Nature and Complexion: Turkish corn undoubtedly  shares one nature and complexion with wheat, the reason for which we  indicated in our Latin herbal.*** \n\n***Its Use and Effect: As Turkish corn has one nature with  wheat, it also has the same effect. People make extraordinarily pretty  white flour from this  grain and then bake bread with it, which easily  causes constipation. That is why, as  it is said, this grain is not used  for bread in Turkey except in times of dearth when no other kind of  crop can be had. The juice of the leaves is said to be slightly cold,  which is why many use it against bloody fluxes (*****rotlauff*****).*** \n\nThis is an interesting text for several reasons. First, maize (again, this is clearly *Zea mays*,  a New World crop) is associated firmly with the Ottoman Empire. Fuchs  is oblivious to its origin, a perspective he shares with many others.  Maize is associated with Turkey in many European languages and its  cultivation spread to Central Europe from the Ottoman realm, where it  was adopted early. In Germany, it is still not fully accepted as food  though it is widely grown as livestock feed and, lately, an energy crop.  It is interesting to note that Fuchs considers it a common garden plant  by 1543 and casually mentions bread produced from it causing  constipation, and this may be the clue to its failure to gain a  foothold. To Germans at the time, grain crops were predominantly bread  crops. A cereal that produced bad bread was not really a worthwhile  addition. It is an interesting but idle speculation whether it might  have succeeded better had it been named \u2018Turkish millet\u2019, but the low  status of porridge compared to bread suggests it  might not have.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10wa735/maize_in_1543_germany/", "created_utc": 1675796979.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10wa735/maize_in_1543_germany/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Absolutely fascinating, thank you for sharing!"]}

Put in a little butter and let it run around the pan, about half a  spoonful. When it has become hot, take a spoonful of egg and put it in.  This fries out nicely, as wide as the pan is. Turn it over so it becomes  nicely brown. Then lay two or four on each plate.***\n\nAs happens so often with this source, this recipe is most interesting  for its remarks on technique and at the same time raises more questions  than it answers. What it describes is a kind of thin pancake made  entirely (or at least largely) of egg. The detailed description and the  remark that these are made this way in Italy suggests that this was not a  familiar preparation. At the same time the author writes that the eggs  should be prepared as for an *ayerplatz* which would describe a  flat pancake. What exactly distinguished this familiar preparation from  the Italian manner is left unclear. It might have been the thinness, or  the size, or the fact that these are served on their own. Many  descriptions of a *platz* or *plat* suggest it is large  enough to serve as the basis for a pastry-like dish or to wrap  significant amounts of filling. They are by and large treated as  ingredients. That may be the key difference. But of course pancakes were  served as a dish in their own right in Germany before the 1550s. \n\nSimply taken as a dish, these *pletzlein* sound attractive enough.  \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

Here is a brief recipe from the  Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch:\n\n***32 To Roast Young Hares that are Filled Entire***\n\n***Take them and cut open their bellies, not with a long  cut, and salt them inside and out. You can also well wash them with wine  vinegar before. Thus they become more tender. Salt them within. Take  small raisins (*****Rosynlein*****), remove the pips, also blanched almonds, cut those into quarters, and also*** **weinberlein*****,  one as much as the other. Put that into the hare, sew its belly shut,  lard it with bacon, and let it roast. This is called filled hares*** (**gef\u00fclte He\u00dflein**).\n\nThese are useful instructions to anyone (like me) who is not adept at  roasting hares. They are also a reminder that the greater amount of  processing taking place in the kitchen also meant greater flexibility. A  simple point of not making a long cut in the belly the better to retain  the filling is easy to follow if you skin the hares yourself. These  days, even if you can get an entire hare at all (good luck), you will  likely get it skinned, gutted, and headless. You can probably still  follow the recipe, but not really in the same way.\n\nAnd of course we once again face the question of what exactly the  difference between Rosin and Weinberlein is. I still tend to view it as  analogous to raisins vs. currants, one type softer and lighter, the  other smaller and harder. But I am really just guessing here. I am also  not convinced that raisins and almonds make an attractive filling  unless, maybe, they are chopped very fine, but I am willing to entertain  the possibility that I am wrong.\n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

This is the original:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpdrlxj038ae1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b7b00892f7591f9bf850da5d8fb29fe8d056f68\n\n***20 Of pike***\n\n***Scale pike and chop them in pieces. Chop parsley, sage, pepper, ginger, caraway, saffron, salt, and wine or vinegar. Make (shape) a vessel entirely of dough and put the fish and the seasoning (condimenten) in it. Close it on top with dough. Bake it in an oven as long as rye bread and serve it. You also do this with trout, salmon, and all other fish.***\n\nAs you can probably see quite clearly, this is \u201cany other fish\u201d, neither noble pike nor mild trout or assertive salmon. The spices are quite forward, so I assumed it would not matter much what kind I used, and I think the results bear me out. Since the recipe dates to the early fifteenth century, it is likely the pastry case is meant mainly as a cooking container and transport vessel, not a food item in its own right. The fish was cooked in it and eaten out of it, not with it, at a later point. So I could recreate a similar effect by cooking the fish in foil rather than take the time to make water paste. If I were to make it for a feast, a solid pastry coffin opened at the top would make a convenient serving container.\n\nI cut the fish into sections, but left the skin and fins on. For the seasoning, I opted for a 50/50 mix of sage and parsley (the greens, this is more likely than the root for this recipe) and a generous dose of pepper with less ginger and caraway. I think that cumin, which is always a possible interpretation of *k\u00fcmmel* in recipes from this early, would have been better, but the result was very pleasant. Cooked slowly at 175\u00b0C for 30 minutes, the fish stayed moist and flaky. I had it cold, as it would have been eaten from a pastry case, with bread, mustard, and (not pictured) tomatoes and was quite convinced.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/31/the-fish-in-pastry-experiment/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/31/the-fish-in-pastry-experiment/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hqk2zz/fish_in_pastry_experiment_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1735667657.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1hqk2zz/fish_in_pastry_experiment_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

From the collection of Philippine Welser, following [the fish galantine with its detailed instructions](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/15/fish-galantine/):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/svqzwfs4up1e1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaae1959be188f0954f964da275f240d4cc42bf3\n\n***216 To make a meat galantine (*****flesch schultz*****)***\n\n***Set the meat to cook in wine and add a little water to it. When you have scummed it, colour it yellow so the meat turns nicely yellow. When the meat is boiled, wash it clean and let it boil again. Afterwards, spice and sugar the broth, but strain it through a cloth before you season it so it is nice and clear. Blow away (remove) the fat on it. Scatter raisins, cinnamon, and ginger in the bowl and put the meat on it. Pour on the broth or (and?) stick almonds into it. Set the bowl in horse dung so it gels in summer.***\n\n***217 To make a pork galantine (*****schweinen sultz*****)***\n\n***Take a suckling pig or veal or some other pork, but especially a (piece?) of a sow, that is best. Parboil it a little in water, then add wine and vinegar, but not too much so it does not become too sour, and let it boil in that. Season it with saffron, pepper, and whole cinnamon, and put in sugar (to make it) as sweet as you want to have it. Let it boil together. Cover (*****bese*****) the bowl (with raisins and spices) and lay the meat on that. Let the broth become clear and pour it over the meat. Stick almonds in it and let it gel.***\n\nThis is basically the same dish described for fish, so many of the instructions for adding the gelling agent and clarifying the broth do not need to be repeated. The end result is a bowl whose bottom is covered in dried fruit and spices, with pieces of meat encased in a translucent aspic whose surface is decorated with almonds, most likely individual blanched kernels stuck into the jelly in decorative patterns. Dishes [like these](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/08/jelly-by-yet-another-name/) [were fashionable](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/01/galantine-jelly-recipes-from-de-rontzier/), often [creatively ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/29/raised-galantine-of-turkey/)[elaborated](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/09/galantine-with-live-fish-from-the-oeconomia/), and surviving recipes describe [many methods](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/07/fish-jelly-from-the-inntalkochbuch/) that are supposed to [ensure ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/04/calves-foot-jelly-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[it will gel](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/08/medieval-gelatin-powder-and-the-next-book-project/).

Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones.

It is nice and long, though, from the collection of Philippine Welser:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqykcn9mw31e1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94fa3019d9ee9b3bb703b5d83d5afaf346acd7fd\n\n***213 Hereafter follow of several galantines***\n\n***If you want to make fish in galantine, for two dishes****:*\n\n***One half pound of almonds, a fierdung of raisins, one half pound of sugar, one lott of saffron, 2 laydt of cinnamon, one laydt of isinglass***\n\n***If you want to have it good, do not add grains of paradise. First, scatter cinnamon, raisins, and mace over the bowl, (but) not too much. When you want to lay in the fish, you should lay in a finger\u2019s length of cinnamon (first). With the abovementioned ingredients, I had fish as follows:***\n\n***5 pounds of carps, 3 pounds of pike, 3 mas of rain fal (Ribolla gialla wine), If you do not have rain fal, you use another kind of strong and good wine, 2 mas of Italian wine (welschwein), 1 mas of old wine***\n\n***You boil the scales and the isinglass in this. Then you take the Italian and the ronfal (Ribolla gialla) wine and put it over the fire. When it boils, pour it over the fish and when the fish is scummed, add half the abovementioned saffron. When the fish is boiled, lay them on a cloth and strain the cooking liquid through a cloth. Spoon off the fat cleanly and press out the scales and isinglass that were boiled through a cloth into a separate dish. Also separated out the fat cleanly and put it into the remaining broth together with the saffron and other spices, except for the ginger. Add the ginger last so it does not become too spicy and the cinnamon dominates the taste (fir schlagen). If you want it to be brighter (layder), add elecampagne (alet). If it does not readily gel, add peas and let them boil with the fish. If you want to put an entire pike\u2019s head into the bowl, have it cut off entirely and two finger\u2019s (worth of fish) should stay attached to it. Before you pour the galantine, you should break the head off from the backbone and set it in the middle. Spread it out (i.e. the gills) with two skewers of wood so it does not fall over. Then take the stomach and roll it well on bran and beat it well (struck through: auf den grind) with a wooden bat before so it becomes thin and spreads out. Then wash it cleanly and turn it inside out, and take flesh of the pike and the greens of the parsley, chop it small and together, and when it is chopped small, stir in a little fine white flour (semel mel) and raisins. Spice it with pepper, then fill the stomach, but do not fill it very full because it becomes shorter and tighter when it boils, and if you fill it too full, it will burst open. When you want to boil the sausage, set it by the fire in water beforehand, and when it begins to boil, prick it with a needle, otherwise it will break open. Only when it is half boiled do you put in the pike, and when the fish is scummed, lay the sausage in with the pike and boil it well because it must boil long.***\n\n\n\n***215 Another galantine (sultz) to make for one and a half dishes***\n\n***Take one half pound of almonds, a fierdung of raisins, and a fierdung of sugar, 1 laydt of saffron, 1 laidt of ginger, 1 laidt of cinnamon, 1 layt of isinglass, Take 5 pounds of carp for this, and 3 pounds of pike, 2 mas of ron fal (Ribolla gialla wine), 2 mas of Italian wine, 1 mas of old wine, 1 spoonful of saffron, ginger and cinnamon.***\n\n***Also let this (the spices) boil with the fish.***\n\nThese are very detailed instructions by any standard, and the format of providing ingredient lists with quantities is highly unusual in sixteenth-century culinary recipes (though common in medicinal ones). It is also interesting in using the first person and may very well be an ego-document of the book\u2019s owner, a recipe not just for but by Philippine Welser.\n\nThe dish is a fairly common one: cooked fish served in a translucent jelly. Here, of course, the most expensive wines, large quantities of spices, and the finest fish are used, but the principle is the same we can still find as *Hering in Gelee* in any North German supermarket. It is problematic that the recipe uses *lot* and *laidt* side by side; these are dialectal variants of the same word, but in the same text, they may refer to different units, possibly trade versus apothecary weight. Usually, a *Lot* is 1/32 of a pound, roughly 15 grammes.\n\nBeyond that, the dish is artful and complicated, and we can reconstruct it fairly well from the detailed instructions for degreasing and clearing the broth, dissolving the gelatin, and displaying the head. It would not look very enticing to modern eaters, though. Complex jellies were highly esteemed at the time.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Take wine, and catch the blood of a calf, and add it. Then set it over coals and stir it until it is about to boil. Then pour that on the meat so it takes on the colour of venison. Chop it into that, and add grated bread, and spice it well. Shape balls the size of a fist and boil them in meat broth. Cut them as you do venison, prepare a pepper sauce to go over them, spice it well, and lay the venison into it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis recipe is obviously not fit for Lent, but can still provide the illusion of a high-class dish from a much cheaper and more ubiquitous meat. Interestingly, there are[ parallels in several earlier sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/28/faking-venison-from-beef/) including the[ Innsbruck MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Innsbrucker-Rezeptbuch.pdf) (#98 and 99) and the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf) (#91), but none that mention the use of blood. I have not tried the method, nor do we have any idea of the proportions, but given how thoroughly blood darkens sauces, I assume it will turn the meatballs quite dark as well.\n\nAs an aside, all these recipes suggest that often when our sources mention *wildbret*, they refer less to a type of meat than a certain preparation, sliced into bite-sized pieces and served in a spicy sauce. that is not a bad way of serving the fiddly bits.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Boil it as you usually do, and when the capon is halfway boiled, take it out and cut it to pieces. Take three toasted slices of bread and a good handful of parsley, and take the same broth (mentioned before) and put them in. Let it boil well together with the capon, and when it is well boiled, take the broth with the bread slices and the parsley and pass it through a cloth. Then add saffron and pour it over the boiled capon. Also add spices if you want to.***\n\nWhile this is the most luxurious way possible to do it, the basic recipe is quotidian: Boil chicken, add seasoning, thicken broth into a sauce with bread. This was how such dishes were prepared in thousands of households throughout the land.\n\nA capon, obviously, is not just any bird. It is rich and tender, comparable to a modern broiling chicken, raised for meat. Adding further meat and colouring the broth with saffron added to the luxury appeal. But even with just a hen and a bit of pepper, this was a feast day dish.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

When you want to roast it, pass it through (i.e. wash it in) fresh water and roast it slowly.***\n\nThere is nothing surprising or unusual about this recipe. This is how you roast beef. There was even a technical term for the low, slow cooking \u2013 *k\u00fchl braten* \u2013 so widespread that an [Eulenspiegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till_Eulenspiegel) tale (lxiiii in the 1515 Strasbourg edition) depends on [wilfully misunderstanding it](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Ein_kurtzweilig_lesen_von_Dyl_Vlenspiegel). What is unusual is that a recipe exists at all. Most recipe books assume people know how to spit-roast meat.\n\nThe technique is fairly straightforward. The *Lendenbraten* \u2013 a particularly coveted cut, roughly the short loin \u2013 is first carefully cleaned. The verb *eder* technically means removing veins, but here we can read it to include sinews. Next, the meat is thoroughly beaten and marinated in wine and spices. As an aside, *k\u00fcmich* usually refers to caraway, but can also mean cumin, making the interpretation slightly iffy. Before roasting, the meat is washed, and though this is not described, it will likely have been larded or basted while cooking.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

These lines contain plenty of religious imagery \u2013 Christ as the honeycomb, the milk of the Virgin Mary \u2013 but they also tell us about what the writer ate, or at least knew was eaten.\n\nFirst, there is milk itself, mentioned in #136. This may be a referenbce to fresh milk for drinking, or for some kind of crudled milk that was eaten, but my guess is fresh milk. The *mulctra* or *mulctrarium* referred to here is a milking pail which supports that interpretation. It is hard to imagine milk being brought to the table in an actual bucket though. Perhaps it was served out from a common container. There is also a mention of goat milk in #146. The default kind most likely was cow milk.\n\nThen there are varieties of cheese. *Caseum* in #138 is the classical term for cheese and here it seems to describe an aged cheese with a rind (an outside) and body (an inside). The *pressura* in #139 means something that is pressed or squeezed. That looks like a good description of curds in contrast to aged cheese.\n\nMany medieval texts are suspicious of the health impact of cheese, and here we have several entiries \u2013 #139 to 143 \u2013 that describe ways of mitigating the harm it was thought to cause. Three of the mention honey as a counteragent, which leads over to the next section, but also is a good candidate for actual practice. Honey and cheese go together very well, and the combination is attested in earlier Roman sources.\n\nThe blessings for honey begin with #144, a reference to the sweetness of it which was its main desired quality. This is followed by the somewhat enigmatic *mel millenarum specierum* in #145. I am not sure whether this is just a flowery description of the complex aroma of good honey or whether it actually means spices were added to it. The latter is possible, though Ekkehart is more likely to use the term *pigmenta* to refer to culinary spices than *species*. We know meat was sometimes cooked with honey and spices, and honey-based sauces are known in both Roman and medieval cuisine. Honey and pepper make a delicious combination, and despite the \u2018thousand\u2019 spices mentioned here, even one would have shown wealth and sophistication.\n\nIt is similarly unclear whether #146 is poetic license or technical vcocabulary. *Nectar* may simply be a poetic description; the Gods on Mount Olympus live on nectar and ambrosia, and is is not clear what either actually is. It could also be a technical term, though. My first guess would be that it describes the liquid honey that flows from harvested honeycombs purely by gravity rather than that which has to be pressed or boiled out. This was considered especially good. With #147, blessing honeycombs specifically may mean that they were served in one piece. This is not unknown in many cultures; after removing the liquid honey, the comb can be sucked or chewed to separate the remainder from the max, which is then spat out.\n\nThe final entry #148 seems out of place. Porridges are treated elsewhere, but this one seems to be grouped here deliberately. A snow white colour could be produced by cooking it with milk and by using a finely bolted flour. Both would have represented status; The porridge of most working people was not white. Interestingly, there is a reference to a porridge of fine flour and milk in the epic poem *Waltharius*, line 1441, too.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057. Theyare a collection of blessings to be spoken over food. Written in short rhyming couplets in Latin, they are unusual in their attention to the diversity of foods and preparations. This is not a serious work of theology or medicine, but an intellectual diversion, playful verse meant to show off a broad vocabulary and facility with Latin. That is what makes them very valuable \u2013 they give us a glimpse of the mental horizon of a senior cleric of the 11th century at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1etxwrg/blessings_for_milk_and_honey_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1723837170.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1etxwrg/blessings_for_milk_and_honey_11th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Today, I gave it another try with a different approach. This time, it worked. The recipe is this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyedf7u14whd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2f99e465e7618f743cc9ddea7d2e1e09dc41517\n\n***56 To make a wine tart of grapes (*****wein draubenn*****)***\n\n***Take the berries of the grapes and a little flour, melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon. Press it through (a sieve) together and put it in a pan. Let it boil until it turns thick, put it into a tart and let it bake a quarter of an hour. When you think it has had enough and it is turning nicely brown, take it out and let it cool. Then sprinkle it with sugar and cinnamon and serve it.***\n\nLast time, I used two tablespoons of flour to half a litre of grape juice and stirred it in while heating the liquid. This time, I increased the quantity \u2013 two tablespoons to 330ml of juice \u2013 and mixed all ingredients befopre heating them. I think that is closer to what the recipe envisions. Again, the liquid thickened quickly and I had to take it off the heat after a very short boiling period. I filled a tart base made from with Philippine Welser\u2019s crust recipe and transfered it to the oven.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cltavx34whd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6611bdf2b31737be1f5e96f06fd4b515ca8a47b9\n\nThis time, I also baked the tart in a flatter pan and on a lower heat (180\u00b0C). The filling bubbled, but did not discolour or rise. After baking, the tart held together well, though there was some \u2018bleed\u2019 on first cutting. However, after it was fully cool, it was easy to cut and could be eaten with the hands.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xyg7tcd54whd1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9647bd4d5c4dd304cbac31f06261f0aa7ffc0fd7\n\nI still want to use grape pulp passed through a sieve with this at one point, but this, I think, comes close to the original intent.

This is, finally, Philippine Welser\u2019s recipe for it:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aw93tancmy8d1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee144df62f2d8773a7cc91d7ef6a777151b5a32e\n\n***115 If you want to fry hares\u2019 ears (hasen nerlach)***\n\n***Take good flour and pour in eggs and warm milk. Salt it and prepare a dough that is not too stiff. Roll it out with a rolling pin until it is thin, then take a pastry wheel and cut it as you please, square or anything else you want, and fry it quickly.***\n\nThis is not a precise recipe, but the combination of eggs, milk, and flour and the instructions to roll out the dough thinly give us a good baseline to work from. The[ list from Tegernsee](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/15/fritters-from-the-tegernsee-list/) reckons one egg per person when \u201chares\u2019 ears\u201d are prepared, which may be relevant for this recipe as well. Interestingly, the instructions here envision no distinctive shape for the finisahged fritter. I assume the original ones must have had one, and [modern version of Hasen\u00f6hrl or Hasen\u00f6hrlein](https://www.genusserbe.bayern.de/350345/index.php) certainly do. Maybe the dough simply became so much of a kitchen staple that it was detached from the original form.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones.

I have once again been distracted by a fascinating source and had to finish a manuscript. Sadly, it does not look like my time will be more plentiful, and since another book badly needs finishing, I cannot promise the posts will become more frequent in the near future.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxj7zv3guk7d1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70023492693b02fe9554fa9e982d6e0638278e54\n\n***110 If you want to make a pounded (gestosenn) fritter***\n\n***Take 8 eggs, 8 spoons full of milk, 4 spoons full of water and make it like a streybla (Strauben) batter. Put it into a cloth, grease the cloth with fat (beforehand) and hang it in a pan with water. Let it boil until it turns nicely thick. Then turn it over (out of the cloth) and cut it into long slices two fingers wide. Lay them in fat and let them fry slowly, and keep the dough warm in warm water.***\n\n***112 If you want to fry bag fritters (sack kiechla)***\n\n***Take as much water as there is eggs and make the batter thinner than streybla (Strauben) batter. Put it into a small bag and lay that into a pot so it boils. After it has boiled a good half and a quarter of an hour, open the bag and push your finger into the batter. If it is boiled to the point you can insert a finger, cut it apart in the middle like you cut a semel loaf. Lay it into cool fat and stir the pan well, that way it rises (kleubts auf). Fry it gently. Make the bag narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, that way you get it out in one piece and can cut it properly.***\n\nThere is very little difference between these two recipes, which once again raises the question why they were recorded separately. A fairly thin, egg-based batter is first boiled in a greased bag (I assume that you would grease the cloth in both cases because it is really the practical thing to do). Once it has firmed up, you take it out, slice it, and fry it at a gentle heat. Since the original batter included no added fat, and milk only in recipe #110, it would likely take well to deep-frying. Given the proximity in time and geography, it should not be surprising that [the Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch has a parallel recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/19/bag-fritters/), though it is less detailed.\n\nBoth recipes have some interesting aspects. The first uses spoons as as measure, likely a common practice though we would love to know what size they were thinking of. The second instructs us to cut the cooked batter apart in the middle like a *semel* loaf. It is at least possible that people already routinely cut their *semel* rolls \u2013 roughly the size of today\u2019s breadrolls \u2013 as we do our *Semmel*. Since, as far as we know, they did not put jams, cheese, or cold cuts on them it is hard to see why, but the suggestion is there. Of course, neither of this is central to the instructions here. The proportion of egg to water or water-milk mixture abnd, more importantly, of flour to liquid is likely the deciding factor in how these fritters turn out, and I find it hard to predict. Neither am I sure I want to try it, though I may if given the opportunity.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

I am still going through that source I found. Give me a few more days\u2026\n\n[Illustration of 16th century pastry wheel from Bartolomeo Scappi\u2019s Opera, courtesy of wikimedia commons](https://preview.redd.it/oly4d5a3qt2d1.jpg?width=1657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=415a3669b8325c625b6090dedde0cc11ef1ce0ff)\n\n***109 If you want to make a wheel-cut fritter (*****redel baches*****)***\n\n***Take good flour, put it on a board, pour on egg and warm milk, salt it, and make a dough.

Cut the dough as you please with a pastry wheel and fry it quickly. Sprinkle with sugar when you wish to serve them.***\n\nAnother recipe from among the many in Philippine Welser\u2019s collection. In terms of ingredients \u2013 eggs, milk, sugar, flour, fat \u2013 these fritters come closer to the modern idea of cookies than most. However, the way they are prepared suggests they would come out hard and crunchy rather than crumbly and \u2018short\u2019. Folding over the dough during rolling would potentially produce as layering effect that would allow the finished fritters to \u2018poof\u2019 and inflate, but that would depend on the proportions of ingredients and how well the dough was worked before going into the pan.

After tarts and pastries, here come the fritters:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2u4025w3n1d1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdcea5602d834cb2bdb6dfb1ad4c956bf11ca8a0\n\n***90 Here follow the fritters***\n\n***If you want to make fritters with a syringe (spritzen baches)***\n\n***Take milk in a pan and put it over the fire. Add a little fat to it and let it boil. Stir in flour and make it dry like dough for bryette kychla (gebr\u00fchte K\u00fcchlein \u2013 choux pastry). Then mix it with eggs and leave it thick (starck). Then put it into the syringe and press it into hot fat. Shake the pan, and let it fry slowly.***\n\n***91 If you want to make fritters with a syringe (spritze baches)***\n\n***Stir up the dough with cold water. It should be a little thicker than common streybla (Strauben) batter. Put some fat into a pan and put the dough into it. When it becomes properly dry, put it into a bowl and put 6 or 8 eggs into warm water, depending on how much dough there is. Break one after the other into the dough until it turns the consistency that can be pressed through the syringe. Then you should lay the dough around the pan like a ring so that it turns into a triple ring and fry it properly.***\n\n***92 If you want to fry fritters with a syringe (sprytze kiechla)***\n\n***Put a little water into a pan and fat, and fry (brenn) the fat so the dough becomes dry (this section seems to be incomplete).

Put it into the syringe and let it fry properly.***\n\nAgain, we get three very similar recipes presented separately, as is common in this collection. All three care variations on choux pastry used to make piped fritters like churros (at least I would reconstruct the incomplete third recipe like that). There is a[ close parallel in the Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch of 1559](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/29/piped-fritters/):\n\n***44 Piped Fritters (Spruetzen Kuechlein)***\n\n***Item take half a seidlein of blue (plae) milk into a pan and let it boil.

Set eggs atop the oven so they become warm, beat them nicely in a pot, salt them, leave out the birds (i.e. strain them) and always pour in a little egg and then beat it (the dough) thoroughly again. You must prepare it so no lumps (puetzlen) remain in it and thicker than for pruete Kuechlein. Put the dough in a syringe and press it out into the fat. Move it about in small circles (fare fein gerings). Moisten the syringe with water beforehand or the dough will not come out. It is thick. You must press them out quickly. Lay them in the fat hot, like pruete kuechlein, and move about with the syringe. If you have a broad pan, you can make them all the better, as wide as the pan.

The close similarity is not surprising; Both works were produced in the same city and within a decade of each other, making it likely the authors, surely culinary professionals, actually knew each other. It also suggests that the parallels between Philippine Welser\u2019s manuscript recipe collection and the [1559 print](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Culinary-Recipes-from-the-Kuenstlich-und-Fuertrefflichs-Kochbuch.pdf) as well as the recipe collection of [Sabina ](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/fb05/germanistik/absprache/sprachverwendung/gloning/tx/sawe.htm)[Welser ](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Sabrina_Welserin.html)and [Maria Stengler](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/fb05/germanistik/absprache/sprachverwendung/gloning/tx/stenglerin-kochbuch-1554.pdf), all from mid-century Augsburg, will repay closer study (already [undertaken by Valoise Armstrong](https://archive.org/details/culinary-change-in-sixteenth-century-augsburg-1/page/107/mode/2up) for the two Welser family manuscripts).\n\nOur main problem reconstructing these fritters is that both the reference points given in the text, *bryette kychla/pruete k\u00fcchlein* and *streybla*, are not as well understood as we would like. The former are a kind of choux pastry fritters, perhaps something broadly like *Windbeutel*.

There are a [few recipes for these ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/09/strauben-fritters-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)surviving, including one from Philippine Welser\u2019s collection to follow, suggesting a [soft but cohesive batter](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/04/figuring-out-straubenteig/).\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Then take eggs and milk and beat them together well. Add sweet butter and spices, sugar it well, and pout it into the pastry crust. Let it bake, and when you want to serve it, put a lid (deckalin) on it.***\n\n***85 Another egg pastry***\n\n***Take creamy milk and set it over (the fire) and add a piece of sweet butter as large as a duck\u2019s egg. Prepare a soft batter from eggs, and when the milk is boiling, pour in the batter and let it boil until it turns into a thick mass (myeslin). Then put it into a bowl, stir in sugar and cinnamon, and afterwards let it bake in a pastry crust.***\n\n***85 To make yet another egg pastry***\n\n***Take eight eggs and beat them well. Pour good creamy milk into that and add a handful of flour. Beat it well together and pass it through a cloth or tight sieve. Let the pastry crust become quite stiff (wol stark werden) in the oven and pour in a little of this (liquid) into it, three times, but not soon after each other. That way it rises nicely. Afterwards, put a lot of sugar on it, that way it is proper. Serve it first.***\n\nThis is interesting, though not terribly adventurous or complex. the three recipes certainly can serve as a warning against assuming you understand a dish from a recipe that mainly lists ingredients. These three pastries all use much the same things, but are likely to come out quite different. Of course, this is nothing new in Philippine Welser\u2019s recipes. They are, for one thing, very close to the [various egg tarts listed earlier](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/27/egg-tarts-from-philippine-welser/), which once again raises the question what exactly the technical difference between a tart and pastry might be. Surely there was one.\n\nThe second interesting point is the mention of having pastry crusts \u201charden\u201d in the oven which is almost certainly a reference to blind-baking. I don\u2019t think this is particularly early, but it serves to reinforce the impression of German sixteenth-century cuisine as sophisticated and complex.\n\nThird, recipe #85 has the egg batter added gradually to the pastry crust. I am not sure what the effect is likely to be, but I suspect an airy, soft filling interspersed with thin browned, possibly even crunchy layers. It may well end up reminiscent of Baumkuchen and should certainly be worth trying out.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Anyways, from the recipe collection of Philippine Welser:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mm2daye2rnzc1.jpg?width=643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f30e9df7ba90f393f6e95ea48a77af6127bf1144\n\n***81 To make stockfish pastry***\n\n***Take the stockfish and parboil it in salt water that is well salted. Take it out and pick out the bones thoroughly, break it up and put it into a pastry crust. Season it well and add butter the size of half a*** **semel** ***loaf and a glass (*****seydlin*****) of wine, and bake it for half an hour.***\n\nThis is thoroughly unsurprising. Just about every recipe collection describes some way of [preparing ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/27/roast-battered-stockfish/)[stockfish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/13/stockfish-from-the-oeconomia/), and it is [frequently ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/11/stockfish-mus-from-meister-eberhard/)[quite ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/18/stockfish-from-meister-eberhard/)[cursory](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/08/stockfish-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/). Some of those recipes can be interesting and inspiring, some are full of technical detail. This is neither. I would have liked to learn how stockfish was processed in the Welser household, how long it was soaked, whether it was beaten or treated with lye. It would also have been interesting to read more about the spices (though chances are it would again by the same [spice mix for pastries served warm](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/10/capon-pastries/)). What this recipe does reinforce is the impression that stockfish was not appreciated much. The military writer Leonhart Fronsperger notes that just about anything else was preferable because it stockfish tasted unpleasant and required large amounts of expensive fat to prepare it. We can certainly see that here. While exact proportions are hard to establish, the recipes in this collection generally do not seem to call for very large quantities. Assuming this is a regular-sized pastry, the amount of butter going in is quite remarkable. A semel loaf would be fine, white bread loaf designed as an individual portion, slightly larger than a Br\u00f6tchen is today. That suggests something like 150 grammes of butter along with a generous glass of wine. Since I don\u2019t know how the fish was processed and how much liquid it would still absorb in that state, I cannot say what consistency this would come out as, but it sounds more like a fish-flavoured butter spread than a pie.\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself, I will once again quote the opinion of the inestimable Marx Rumpolt on stockfish in a noble kitchen:\n\n***Recipe 12: Of the*** **Manscho Blancko** ***that is made from stockfish you can make many dishes as is stated before. And if you were to make however many dishes of a stockfish, it is still just a stockfish and remains a stockfish, do what you will, it still is a stockfish. It goes through all the lands except Hungary, because they have enough fish there and a Hungarian says rightaway \u201c*****Bidesk Bestia*****\u201d that is, the rogue stinks. And you can make many dishes from stockfish, but it isn\u2019t worth the trouble.***\n\n***Marx Rumpoldt, Ein new Kochbuch, 1581, p CXXXII v.***", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1coz4qe/stockfish_pastry_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1715372480.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1coz4qe/stockfish_pastry_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Make nice pieces out of it and remove the innards carefully (eders wol). Lay it in as bowl and salt and spice it, and swirl it all together.

Then cut it into pieces and stick it with cloves, cinnamon, rosemary, and sage. Roast (uber brott) it a little and then season the pieces nicely with all kinds of spices. Prepare a good sauce (brielin) with spices and butter, and you can also add green herbs and sugar, if you want to have it sweet, and sweet wine. Put this into a pastry crust, close it, and let it bake slowly.***  \n  \nThis is an interesting set of recipes, simple, but potentially good. Eels were a popular and relatively plentiful fish, though all fresh fish was a luxury. Putting it in a pastry crust with spices and butter or, in the second case, wine and sugar is a fairly conventional thing to do.

Today, I will talk a little about the flavour associated with that month in modern Germany more than any other: Woodruff, and especially the sweet and alcoholic [Maibowle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_wine). This entry is an updated version of as essay I wrote for the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery in 2017, and you can find the original [here](https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/it-tastes-green/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opxihhukeoxc1.jpg?width=1448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=167d91473309340c64411f809c30a7abc5164fbe\n\nKnown by its German colloquial name as *Waldmeister* (master of the forest), this plant with its distinctive white flowers and crowns of leaves around the stem grows in deciduous forests throughout Germany and is foraged in spring and early summer for its leaves and stems which are used to flavour drinks and sweets. This is best done by allowing them to wilt slightly after they are picked and then pouring boiling water over them to extract the aroma. Steeping them for extended periods is not recommended because of their high coumarin content, but happens frequently. The result is an occasional headache.\n\nNeither easy availability nor pleasant taste can explain how this distinctive flavour became so popular. Actual woodruff has not been used in industrially produced foods marketed to children for health reasons since 1974, yet artificially flavoured imitations continue to sell well. The leaves of commercially grown woodruff show up on German street markets in late April every year so buyers can make their traditional *Maibowle* untroubled by such concerns. Germans love their *Waldmeister*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbeve2tneoxc1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=901d214f5516f1aaab0029c962ad0c07d155ee1f\n\nThe origin of this love affair is probably connected with the *Maibowle* or *Maiwein* traditionally served for May Day celebrations. Today, [EU law defines *Maiwein*](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=126932) as wine flavoured primarily with woodruff while *Maitrank* also has fruit and sugar added. It is unclear how far back this tradition goes, but many food historians are probably too optimistic in their estimate of deep time. A frequently cited starting point is the poem [*de mensium nominibus*](http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000832_00611.html) written by the Benedictine monk [Wandalbertus Prumiensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandelbert) around 845. Describing events and activities associated with each month in classical Latin verse, it states for May:\n\n***Hoc herbis durum prodest mollire lieum***\n\n**Now it is good to soften harsh wine with herbs**\n\nUnfortunately, the connection seems more tenuous the closer we get to the original text. Nineteenth century sources offer more solid ground: the[ *Grimmsches W\u00f6rterbuch*](http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/?sigle=DWB&mode=Vernetzung&lemid=GM00599#XGM0059) states that woodruff-flavoured wine is known by the name *Maitrank* in the 1830s. A Swiss dictionary quotes a [description of *Meyentrank* dated to 1708](https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id14.htm#!page/141135/mode/1up) involving fumitory, sage, wormwood, melissa, hyssop, and borage, but no woodruff[.](https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/it-tastes-green/#footnote) That association seems to date no earlier than the 1800s. By 1854, it is firm enough that the best-selling Romantic poem [*Der Trompeter von S\u00e4ckingen*](https://dl.ub.uni-freiburg.de/diglit/scheffel_sw1/0144?sid=eea3ffe85029f062049ea8aa501177ba) by Joseph Victor von Scheffel envisions a medieval outdoor celebration involving *Maiwein* improvised by a fishing party of noblemen. The lord calls for wine, lemons and sugar:\n\n>\n\nThis is, of course, entirely anachronistic for medieval Germany, but it comes very close to what modern Germans know by the name of *Maibowle*. By 1901, the influential cookbook of Henriette Davidis (39th edition) provides instructions for making *Maiwein*:\n\n>\n\nThe recipe continues by pointing out that woodruff may be steeped briefly if not enough of it is available, but must be removed quickly and thoroughly. It ends by suggesting that May wine may be served as a sorbet, frozen and mixed with beaten egg whites, on hot days. In 1958, the *Kochbuch der B\u00fcchergilde* by the sadly underestimated Grete Willinsky suggests the following procedure:\n\n>\n\n>\n\nFew recipes are more elaborate than this, though it is traditional to add fruit, especially oranges or strawberries, to the punch bowl. *Maibowle* is served for *Tanz in den Mai*, a late-night party on the eve of May Day that usually features outdoor music, dancing and flirting.\n\nThere is more depth to it than this, though \u2013 there almost invariably is, with folklore. Herbal wines are often found in cooking and medical recipe sources, straddling the boundary between the culinary, medicinal, and magical sphere. As far as I can tell, they did not use woodruff, but the herbs combined in them were varied and interesting. Whether the aim was simply to improve the wine, give it some seasonal flavour, or impart health-giving or other properties is often hard to say. Certainly, herbal remedies and recipes were widely known. These were not secrets, though some imagine them to be today.\n\nThe people enjoying a heady, sweet green drink tonight may well be unaware of the depth of history this chameleon of a holiday. Nonetheless, whatever we do to mark the occasion, from flower-bedecked birch saplings to red banners, we enjoy the warmth of spring and the return of greenery all over northern Europe.\n\nHeia Walpurgisnacht.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ch2uw3/may_wine/", "created_utc": 1714508852.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ch2uw3/may_wine/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Today it\u2019s another piece of the K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald, in praise of the goose:\n\n\n\n*III In Praise of the Goose*\n\n\n\n*This is the tale of the goose,*\n\n*It is not empty talk.*\n\n\n\n*Some say of game*\n\n*That it is plentiful.*\n\n*Some speak of birdsong,*\n\n*I will bring you something better!*\n\n*Nightingales, thrushes and siskins:*\n\n*I will praise something better!*\n\n*Calandra larks, larks and blackbirds:*\n\n*There is no meat on them.*\n\n*Peacocks, chickens and ducks:*\n\n*That is nonsense.*\n\n*I will tell you quickly*\n\n*How useful a bird the goose is!*\n\n*Be it dark or light (meat),*\n\n*It produces fine morsels.*\n\n*Skin and thighs*\n\n*I will not run away from*\n\n*And the priest\u2019s cuts (i.e. the breast)*\n\n*I will gladly sit down to.*\n\n*Wings and neck skin*\n\n*Are best roasted*\n\n*Neck, feet and innards*\n\n*Are not bad when boiled.*\n\n*That drips into the (roasting) pan*\n\n*As I can tell you!*\n\n*Let that not dismay you*\n\n*It will make a fine sauce.*\n\n*And that (the goose) lays large eggs*\n\n*From which you raise young geese*\n\n*Needs to be said here.*\n\n*If twenty men came to a house*\n\n*Where a goose lay by the fire*\n\n*The smell coming from it*\n\n*Would attract them strongly:*\n\n*All would think, there will also be enough for me.*\n\n*O mind who increases my art:*\n\n*The usefulness only just begins here*\n\n*As I will describe to you.*\n\n*People write with the feather quill*\n\n*And use it as a needlecase:*\n\n*You fletch bolts and also arrows*\n\n*With which a man defends the home*\n\n*In which he raises his children.*\n\n*I also speak of this:*\n\n*You use the bones to catch*\n\n*Quail which people eat.*\n\n*But even those who forgo these*\n\n*Will still have use of it:*\n\n*Tailors, too, must have them*\n\n*As I will tell you;*\n\n*They sew across a feather quill.*\n\n*Some are pleased to use*\n\n*A feather quill in their crossbow*\n\n*So the nut does not come loose.*\n\n*Those are still not all its uses:*\n\n*The feather quill is so fine*\n\n*That mercury is carried in it.*\n\n*Further, it is the custom to use geese*\n\n*To catch wolves with them*\n\n*By tying them to a hurdle*\n\n*That is a more promising manner*\n\n*Than using pigeons.*\n\n*You use the feather quill on a cap (zuor huben)*\n\n*And a slappe hangs from it*\n\n*Which the young squire wears.*\n\n*It is also useful to the fisherman*\n\n*He uses the quill for fishing*\n\n*So that it holds up the line.*\n\n*But the best is yet to come,*\n\n*It is no lie*\n\n*that the quill is used in a stone crossbow (steinbogen)*\n\n*To keep the strings apart*\n\n*One should be equipped accordingly.*\n\n*Weavers spool thread over the quill*\n\n*To make clothes*\n\n*And make their living from them.*\n\n*To play the bagpipes (blaterspiel)*\n\n*Someone blows through a quill*\n\n*When piping to a dance*\n\n*And people take each other\u2019s hands.*\n\n*A bent leg feather*\n\n*Is used to make bait for falconry*\n\n*You cannot do without it.*\n\n*The goose is also a good guard animal.*\n\n*A feather duster*\n\n*Is used on tables and benches*\n\n*And fan the embers.*\n\n*Those who need it call for it*\n\n*And bind it to the helm*\n\n*Beneath it, the dust rises (from the field).*\n\n*If someone does not believe me:*\n\n*I call the family of Neuenstein to witness*\n\n*Who defended their honour under it*\n\n*On behalf of beloved, pure ladies*\n\n*And those of Veinau*\n\n*Who are looked at with high honour*\n\n*They carry head and neck (in their armory)*\n\n*It has long been allowed them.*\n\n*Now begins the principal use:*\n\n*You whistle on the bones*\n\n*To raise people\u2019s spirits.*\n\n*And hear what people do on the beds*\n\n*In which the feathers are contained:*\n\n*You make children on them*\n\n*A man with his wife*\n\n*Their pure, tender bodies*\n\n*Make gentlemen and princes*\n\n*Who shall strive for honour*\n\n*Priests, knights, and sergeants,*\n\n*I believe I speak the truth,*\n\n*Burghers and peasants.*\n\n*This poem became me ill*\n\n*When I made it known*\n\n*It is called the praise of the goose*\n\n*And it was created boldly*\n\n*By the kuenig vom Otenwalde*\n\n*Here ends the poem of the goose*\n\n*Let nobody make claims on me (i.e. punish me) about it.*\n\n  \nI admit I really like goose, but I\u2019m nowhere near that effusive. At any rate, it is fascinating to see there is a canonical style of cooking a goose \u2013 the main body roasted with the drippings used to make sauce, cut-off pieces and innards roasted or boiled, and apparently the meat being served in slices and quite smnall portions (I would not try to serve a single goose to twenty, no matter how substantial the bird). That the breast is known as priests\u2019 slices (*pfaffensnitze*) tells us both that priests were seen as gluttons and that goose meat was served sliced up, in small pieces.\n\nThe rest of the poem is no less interesting and reminds us that animal products sourced from the domestic environment of most people had immediate uses in a wide variety of applications.There really was no great degree of separation between the production going on all around them and the things they used every day. Nobody needed reminding why people were doing the jobs they were doing.\n\nThe actual examples chosen are an odd assortment, but they make sense in the context of someone familiar with the life of the lesser nobility and senior secular clergy, people equally at home with bookkeeping and the hunt. The \u2018stone crossbow\u2019 is a weapon designed to hunt birds which lauinches small sonten wedged into a pouch on a double bowstring. I am not sure whether this is a particularly early description, but it is an interesting one. Clearly the author expects this to be a familiar item. The \u2018feather duster\u2019 is most likely an entire wing, probably dried or smoked, that could be used to fan fires, bust surfactes, and mounted on a helmet with more dignity than the poofy feather-covered stick we associate with the word today. Finally, a fisherman using a quill \u201cso that it holds up the line\u201d suggests something a lot like modern angling with a fishing pose. That likely was more recreational than professional.\n\nDer K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald is an otherwise unknown poet whose work is tentatively dated to the 1340s. His title may refer to a senior rank among musicians or entertainers, a Spielmannsk\u00f6nig, but that is speculative. Many of his poems are humorous and deal with aspects of everyday life which makes them quite interesting to us today. The evident relish with which he describes food and the fact his work is first recorded in a manuscript owned by the de Leone family led scholars to consider him the author of the Buoch von Guoter Spise, but that is unlikely.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1c9parf/in_praise_of_the_goose/", "created_utc": 1713725037.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1c9parf/in_praise_of_the_goose/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I love geese."]}
{"title": "Goose in Pastry (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/15/goose-in-pastry/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/15/goose-in-pastry/)\n\n I have not abandoned my blog, but today is the first day I have some  time by myself (the grandmother is on site and has decided the kid needs  some proper spoiling) and the laptop up. I have also found some  fascinating stuff for when I am back at my desk, but for now it\u2019s just  this recipe from Philippine Welser\u2019s collection: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmzkj5mlvouc1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bdc88a2be2175922a7b55a801a3c754c37464dc\n\n***67 If you want to make a goose pastry***\n\n***Clean the goose completely and scald it well in water.  Then take it out and press it down in the middle so it flattens and  widens (jn der mit wol yn die breyde). Then take the spice that  is described for capon pastry and sprinkle it very well, and then salt  it very well. The take lemons, apples, pears, bacon, and caraway and  stir it well together. It must be chopped a little, not too much, just  the pears and the bacon. Fill the goose with that and arrange around it  what is left of the filling. Lard the goose well and lay broad slices of  bacon under the feet and the wings. Make a dough as though for venison  pastries and wrap the goose in it (so that it is) shaped like a goose.  Put it into the tart pan and let it bake.***\n\nThis is interesting and represents as much of a technical challenge as an interpretatory one. The \u201cspice that is described for [capon pastry](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/10/capon-pastries/)\u201d is probably this:\n\n*\u2026****Then lay it into a bowl or platter and take the mixed spices as is described after this: 8 lot of ginger, 4 lott of pepper, 4 lot of nutmeg, 4 lott of cloves, 3 lot of cinnamon, pound all of that together and add a third part (dryttel) of salt, that makes eight and a half lott, this is proper with all pastries that are served hot.*** *\u2026*\n\nI am not sure how well this will work with goose, but it is certainly  assertive. And that is just the beginning. Lemons (I assume not many,  given their cost), apples, pears, bacon and caraway are added as a  filling and arranged around the bird. The combination of apples or pears  and bacon was not unknown as a goose filling earlier, incidentally. It  is documented in other recipes. Combining it with lemons and such a  strong spice mixture, though, seems excessive. In addition, we find  bacon added. the last thing a modern goose needs to cook is more fat,  but it seems that geese in the sixteenth century had leaner legs. we may  be talking about a wild bird, but I doubt it. \n\nThe whole thing, wrapped up in pastry dough and baked, should be  \u201cshaped like a goose\u201d, presumably a roast one. Also, since it is to be  cooked in a tart pan, this implies either a smaller goose than is  customary today (the more likely supposition) or a much larger tart pan  than I have seen described elsewhere. \n\nI may not try this simply because the failure potential is out of proportion to the cost, but it intrigues me. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of  Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones.

Take 4 sage leaves, 3 marjoram** ***steydlin*** **(branches?  bundles?) and spikenard or roses so that it smells of it, and chop it  with the liver. Then take half a pound of sugar, 2 spoonfuls of pepper, a  handful of pounded almonds, a handful of grated** ***semel*** **bread, 9  eggs, and a piece of fat as large as for a water soup. Stir these  things well together, salt it a little, and pour it on a tart bottom.  Let it bake gently for about an hour. Take half of the abovementioned  almonds, add sugar and rosewater, and when the tart is just baked  enough, spread the moistened almonds on it as thinly as possible with  your finger so it is covered as thinly as possible all over. Then let it  bake another half of a quarter hour, thus it is proper.**\n\nThe recipe is comfortably set between one for strawberry tart and a  pancake made with grated bread and almonds, clearly not out of place  there. I doubt even many adventurous modern eaters could be brought  around to it, though. The idea of eating meat in a sweet dish has become  quite alien to the European palate. We can still see how liver goes  well with pepper, sage and marjoram and might countenance almonds \u2013  effectively a filler, really \u2013 but sugar in this quantity is  disconcerting. Depending on the amount of liquid involved, this looks to  become either a liver custard or a sweet variety of Leberwurst. I must  admit it makes me curious enough to try it, but I would still not serve  it to anyone.  \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

Then put them  in water and let them boil. Then, you pound them very small in a mortar  and add six egg yolks and freshly melted butter, sugar, cinnamon and  ginger, grated semel bread and a little milk. Salt it well and let it bake a quarter hour, then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on it.***\n\nThe first thing modern readers are likely to notice is that, except  for the absence of pumpkins, this is a modern pumpkin pie. That is not a  surprise given the [deep roots that recipe has](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/10/pumpkin-pie-from-the-oeconomia/) [in Early Modern European cooking](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/07/pumpkin-pie-trial/), but if you ever felt like using a [carved turnip](https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Collections-Research/Collection/Top-things-to-see-in-the-Irish-Folklife-Collection/Artefact/Ghost-turnip/b202e8ea-0728-4b3d-b0f1-82660fe45ce9) in place of a [Jack o\u2019Lantern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack-o%27-lantern) for Halloween, here is the pie to serve. \n\nThe problem or advantage when reconstructing this recipe, depending  on how you look at it, is that we don\u2019t really know what kind of root  vegetables were used. The word *R\u00fcben* is not very clear. Used  without a qualifier today, it usually means sugar beets, but these are  both thoroughly modern and an industrial crop. In old cookbooks, it  usually means a turnip, a plant massively out of favour since the end of  the World Wars. In the sixteenth century, a variety of root crops were  grown across Germany, and the word *R\u00fcben* could be used to refer  to locally dominant types in the same way the English term corn could  mean the locally dominant bread grain before the meaning settled on  maize. *R\u00fcben* is the root-y counterpart to *Kraut*, a term that covers all kinds of leafy greens, and *Kraut und R\u00fcben* described the vegetable stew a poor family might gather from its kitchen garden. In modern German, it means a disorderly mess. \n\nThat said, the Welser family was ridiculously rich. These were people  with refined palates and we have no reason to think they allowed  anything coarse or tasteless on their tables. A number of root crops  make credible candidates, including small turnip varieties like [*Mair\u00fcbchen*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mair%C3%BCbe),  but also parsnips, salsify, parsley roots, or indeed carrots. They may  well have been used at various times during the year, changing the  flavour of the dish with the season. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

Take half a pound of sugar and six newly laid eggs with it,  but only the whites of the eggs, and a little good rosewater. Mix it all  together and (take) a thin tart base with a wreath (as the edge) and  pour the abovementioned on it. Brush it with rosewater as lightly as you  can (auff wennigest). Sprinkle it all over with sugar and blow  it off again, then sprinkle on sugar again and blow it off again and  then sprinkle sugar on it and blow it off again.

It will be pretty and good.***\n\n***7 Of tarts: If you want to make an almond tart***\n\n***Firstly, put one pound of almonds on the table and pound  them well or grind them, and when they are about to become oily, pour on  rosewater. When they are ground, put them into a bowl and take the  whites of five eggs and some cream and rosewater. Add this to the ground  almonds until it turns thin so that it flows, but not too thin. Put  this on a tart base and let it bake nicely in a tart pan. When it has  set well (wol erstarcht ist), take the yolk of an egg and  rosewater, beat it well, brush the tart all over, on top and on the  sides, and let it bake completely.***\n\n***8 If you want to make a quite good almond tart***\n\n***Take a pound of almonds on the table and grind it with  rosewater so that they are very small. Take it out into a bowl and take  the whites of eight newly laid eggs. Beat it so it becomes like water  and strain it, and add an eighth (achtelin) of cream and beat  that into the egg whites. Then stir in the almonds and add enough sugar  so that it is quite sweet, otherwise it is not good. When it is half  baked, sprinkle it with rosewater and then let it bake fully. It must be  baked quite gently and with few embers above, otherwise it will be  brown.***\n\n***9 If you want to make a tart of almonds***\n\n***Take the almonds and grind them small. Take the yolks of  eggs and a little grated bread, sugar, and rosewater, stir it together  and pour it on a tart base. Bake it quickly so it does not burn and put  in very little sugar beforehand. When the tart hardens (erstarckt), add a bit of butter on it every now and then. When it has risen up, sprinkle it well with sugar and let it bake fully.***\n\n***10 If you want to make a tart of almonds***\n\n***Grind the almonds small with rosewater and add cinnamon.  Take the whites of three eggs and rosewater and grind it well together.  Spread it on a tart base and bake it nicely gently (fein lieb). When it is half baked, sprinkle it well with sugar and with rosewater. You can also make fritters (krepfla) with this filling and fry them in fat.***\n\n***11 If you want to make a good almond tart***\n\n***Take a good pot (gaffenn) full of almonds and grind them small. When it is ground small, add a few raisins and currants (weynber unnd zy wybenn)  into it. Then spread it on a tart base, take the yolk of an egg and  brush the tart with it. When it is half baked, sprinkle it well with  sugar and with rosewater. Then let it bake enough. The filling (fillin) should be two fingers thick.***\n\nOne thing that makes the recipe collection of Philippine Welser  interesting is that it often includes variations on a theme. These  recipes are all for slightly different almond tarts, and it is possible  they were actually gathered from different sources. There is nothing  surprising or novel about them. Tarts, baked in a closed container in  the coals (the *Tortenpfanne* or tart pan) were popular, and  almonds represented luxury and refinement. It is, however, unusual to  find such variation in so early a source. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

{"title": "Stollen History", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/16/playing-with-stollen/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/16/playing-with-stollen/)\n\n In Germany today, *Stollen* is for Christmas and to many, it is not Christmas without proper *Stollen*, often specifically called *Christstollen* or *Weihnachtsstollen*.  The name itself just means a round, thick object which is why in modern  German, it also refers to a gallery in a mine (from the wooden  supports) and the cleats of football shoes. But when it comes to food,  it is highly specific.  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pj8oqbdwqo6c1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25f38dc98a9ba1ff98c2a286dd2f4a41b0269d05\n\nThe origins of Stollen are as thoroughly researched as they are  trivial. Fine yeast breads, enriched with various more or less luxurious  ingredients, probably existed long before they enter the historical  record. They went by many local names, and as a result, [regardless of what legends were crafted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stollen) around these mentions in later years, a *Stollen* showing  up in any medieval source is unlikely to be what we know by that name  today. In what is likely the first mention, surviving only in a later  translation, the *Stollen* delivered to the bishop of Naumburg by  the bakers from 1329 onwards are not defined beyond being long and made  of fine flour. The association of Stollen baking with the papal  permission of 1490 to use butter in Advent, often mentioned in  advertising, is tenuous at best. Such indulgences were made numerous  times in history simply because olive oil, the staple culinary fat of  fast days in Italy, was not easily available in Germany.   \n\nThe kind of yeasted, enriched cake that modern Stollen descends from  is recorded in a number of recipes. Marx Rumpolt describes creative uses  in 1581:\n\n***41 Prepare a dough with milk, eggs, and fine white flour,  add a little beer yeast, and make a good dough that is not too stiff  and do not oversalt it. Set it in a warm place so that it rises nicely,  then turn it out onto a clean board and put in small black raisins.  Shape long cakes (*****Str\u00fctzel*****) and throw  them in hot butter to  fry them, thus they will rise nicely. Serve them warm or cold and strew  them with sugar, thus they are a good dish (*****gut Gebackens*****).*** \n\n***(41 is a recipe for cherry-filled fritters)***\n\n***43 Take a new pitcher, grease it thoroughly on the inside  with melted butter, and put such a dough into it so that the pitcher is  half full. When it has risen so that it is full, slide it into a hot  oven and let it bake. Take it out, let it cool, break the pitcher and  remove the shards. Serve it in one piece, then it will look like a  pitcher.***  \n\n***44 But if you want to serve such a baked dish that is  nicely warm, take small earthen pitchers or pots one finger high, slide  them into the oven with that (the dough) and bake them, and break the  pots or pitchers so the cakes stay whole. Take fresh May butter and melt  it. Turn over the cakes in it and strew them well with white sugar.  Serve them warm, that is a good warm dish.*** \n\nEven the word *Str\u00fctzel* (*Striezel* in modern German), an alternative name for *stollen*, makes an appearance, but still these are not *Stollen*. Like *Stollen*,  though, these cakes include raisins and are brushed with butter and  covered in powdered sugar. What they aren\u2019t is associated with  Christmas. Even though the recipe calls for fresh butter, they could be  made in winter. It would be an extravagant luxury, but that never  stopped Rumpolt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/npas8etxqo6c1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb882b86659ab909b83dd4c623ae09c758c9a836\n\n \n\nThe association with Christmas seems to come from Saxony, where it is still celebrated for tourists in a [very lucrative manner](https://www.dresdnerstollen.com/en/stollenassociation/stollen-baker). Interestingly, what created the specialness of *Stollen* was  not its own development, but the way other cakes changed. In the course  of the 19th century, heavy, rich yeast cakes with spices and dried  fruit increasingly fall out of favour, surviving only as regional and  festive specialties. North Germany still has the [*Klaben* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremer_Klaben)or *Kl\u00f6ben*, a very similar preparation, that is recorded in the Hamburgisches Koch-Buch of 1830:\n\n***I***X ***No. 88: To bake good*** **Kl\u00f6ben**\n\n***Take 10 pounds of flour, 2 pounds of butter, half a*** **Loth** ***of  cinnamon, half a pound of currants, a quarter pound of sugar, 1 cup of  syrup, 2 cups of large raisins, 4 beer glasses of warm milk, 2 glasses  of yeast, and prepare it as Hannoverschen Kuchen. From this dough, you  can prepare 5*** **Kl\u00f6ben*****, brush them with egg yolk, and bake them in an oven.***   \n\n(\u2026)\n\nIX ***No 106:*** **Hannoverscher** ***Butter Cake***\n\n***Take two pounds of good wheat flour, a quarter pound of  ground sugar, cardamom, three egg yolks, and grated lemon peel in an  earthen bowl. Lay one pound of butter and a little salt in the centre of  the flour and pour on a large beer glass full of warm milk and a little  less warm white beer yeast. Stir it all well together and if the dough  is not soft enough, add a little more warm milk.  When all is stirred  well and the dough detaches from the bowl, work them thoroughly with  your hands on a table and roll it out as evenly as the sheet on which it  is meant to be baked. \u2026***\n\nThis is a good technique for making a rich, heavy yeast dough, and though the recipe for the *Hannoverschen* cake is decidedly not a *Stollen* \u2013 it is rolled out on a sheet, dotted with butter, and covered in sugar like a [*Prophetenkuchen*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/12/continuity-and-change-in-sheet-cake/)[ ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/12/continuity-and-change-in-sheet-cake/)\u2013 this is how *Stollen* dough  is traditionally prepared. So again, I suspect what we are seeing here  is a set of techniques that are applied and combined across a wide range  of dishes being codified into a definite recipe and furnished with a  name by the rules-loving nineteenth century. Johann Friedrich Baumann\u2019s  Der Dresdner Koch of 1844 gives us the proper way of making it:\n\n**Butterstolle** ***or*** **Butterzopf*****, Saxon /*** **Gateau de noele \u00e0 la Saxonne**\n\n***One*** **M\u00e4schen** ***of flour is warmed in a bowl,  sieved, and returned to the bowl, and a well is formed (in the flour).  Four tablespoons of fresh, thick yeast are mixed with one tablespoon of  sugarand mixed into an eighth of a*** **Kanne** ***of warm milk, poured into the well, and a soft yeast dough starter (*****Hefenst\u00fcckchen*****)  is mixed and dusted with flour. Cover it with a warmed napkin folded  four times and set it in a lukewearm place. When the starter has risen  high, add two eggs, eight*** **Loth** ***of sugar, two*** **Loth** ***of bitter almonds ground to a powder with a little water, salt, and, if desired, a good pinch (lit: a knife tip,*** **Messerspitze*****)  of mace. The whole is worked into a firm and rather dry dough and  worked well. In case the liquid is not sufficient, add a little more  warm milk. Then twenty to twenty-four*** **Loth** ***of washed, dry  butter that has been worked to be pliable is cut up and worked into the  dough, first one half, then the other.  Then you add three quarters of a  pound of large, stoned raisins and one quarter pound of small raisins,  four to eight*** **Loth** ***of slivered sweet almonds, and four*** **Loth** ***similarly  cut citron, all of which must first be brought to lukewarm temperature.  Work it in well, dust the dough with flour, cover it with a napkin  folded four times, and set it to rise in a lukewearm place where the  butter does not melt. The bowl must always feel lukewarm, never hot. One  the dough has once again risen high, it is turned out on a floured  table,gently and easily pushed together into a round loaf and then  rolled out into a log (*****Walze*****) of sixteen to eighteen inches  that is slightly thicker in the middle than at both ends. The rolling  pin is then placed lengthwise along the middle and pushed down, and half  of the dough rolled out to twice its width. This is folded back onto  the tall half again so that a seam (an edge) is formed along the top.  This*** **Stolle** ***is now deftly turned out on a  double-layered,  buttered paper by lifting with the hands at both ends. If you have one,  lift it onto a metal baking sheet. After about ten minutes, because the*** **Stolle** ***is  only allowed to rise a little more, it is brushed to shininess with  lukewarm water of melted butter, put into a moderate oven, and baked for  t******hree quarters of an hour to a fine colour.  Removed from the oven, it is brushed with melted clear butter and, once  cold, dusted with sugar.*** \n\n***This*** **Stolle** ***is always served cold and lasts for  many days. It is mainly enjoyed at Christmas when it is found  everywhere, even among the poorer classes.***   \n\nWe can legitimately question whether the poor of Dresden really  enjoyed this in 1844, which was the height of Old Europe\u2019s last great  hunger crisis. We cannot quibble with the fact that this is clearly *Stollen* as  we know it. It is clearly a traditional and established recipe by this  time, good enough for a high-status cook to include in a work intended  to carry it beyond the borders of Saxony. As so often happens, the  recipe, once fixed, remained more or less frozen. It is still broadly  how we make *Dresdner Stollen*, though bitter almonds no longer feature routinely and there is often more variety of candied fruit peel involved. \n\nI enjoy Stollen at Christmas and always make some to give away to  family and friends as well. However, as a fan of industrial cuisine, I  do not use the traditional recipe most years. My go-to reference is the *Quarkstollen* from  the Dr Oetker Schulkochbuch, first included in the 1937 edition. This  is the more detailed version from the 1963 Backbuch:  \n\n***Stollen***\n\n***Dough: 500g wheat flour, 1 sachet Dr Oetker Backin  (baking powder), 200g sugar, 1  sachet Dr Oetker vanillin sugar, a  little salt, 4 drops Dr Oetker baking aroma bitter almond, 1 vial Dr  Oetker rum aroma, 4 drops Dr Oetker baking aroma lemon, 1 pinch ground  cardamom, 12 pinch ground mace, 2 eggs, 125g butter or margarine, 50g  beef fat, 250g quark (well pressed), 125g currants (washed and well  drained), 125-150g raisins (washed and well drained), 125-150g almonds  or hazelnuts (ground or chopped), 50-100g candied citron peel (diced).*** \n\n***To brush: 50g butter or margarine (melted)***\n\n***To dust: 50g powdered sugar (2 heaped tablespoons)***\n\n***Mix flour and baking powder and sift them onto a board  (tabletop). Press a well into the middlke and add sugar, vanillin sugar,  spices, and eggs. Work into a thick mash with some of the flour.  Distribute the cold fat cut into pieces, the finely chopped beef fat,  the quark (it is improved by being passed through a sieve), the currants  and raisins, the almonds (hazelnuts) and the citron peel on top. Cover  the fruit with flour and work all ingredients into a smooth dough  quickly, working from the middle. If it is sticky, add some more flour.  Shape the dough into a Stollen and lay it out on a baking sheet covered  in greased parchment.***  \n\n***Gas: Pre-heat 5 minutes on large flame, bake at 1/2 large flame, setting 2-3 1/2***\n\n***Electric: Pre-heat 10 minutes at top 2 \u2013 bottom 3, bake  at top 2 \u2013 bottom 2 (if necessary, switch to top 1 \u2013 bottom 2 after 45  minutes). Temperature setting pre-heat at 250, bake at 160-180.***\n\n***Baking time: 50-60 minutes***\n\n***Brush the Stollen with fat and dust it with powdered sugar immediately after baking.*** \n\nQuark, a kind of cheese curd, became very popular in the early 20th  century and has remained so. It adds to the dough\u2019s rich substance.  reducing the need for butter and eggs, the greatest cost driver with *Stollen*.  The recipe itself is a transparent marketing device to sell the myriad  products of Dr Oetker\u2019s better-baking-through-chemistry range.  Regardless of this, it is not just an economical recipe, it is also  delicious and produces a reliably well-behaved dough that I turn into  traditional *Stollen*, bite-sized *Stollenkonfekt*, or mini-*Stollen* suitable for smaller families.

Sometimes these are buttons, pins,  ribbons, or  beads. I often use spice mixtures. This is one I prepared  this week for an upcoming event. It is based on a recipe in the Meister Hans collection: \n\n \n\n[Bagged and ready](https://preview.redd.it/501n7s1ngbzb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaec24efc31f83fc8c1ed74c5c2869f52ef3a0b6)\n\n***Recipe #81 Ain gr\u00fcne sals die mach also vnd behalt die***\n\n***A green sauce, make it thus and keep it***\n\n***Item take sage and onions, parsley and sorrel old and  young.

And take dried white bread and make a powder  of all of this. When you wish to eat it, temper it with wine or with  vinegar. And keep (store) this as long as you please.***\n\nThis recipe is the most detailed I have found yet, but these [instant](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/19/a-green-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) [sauce ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/11/another-green-sauce/)[powders ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/09/instant-herb-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/)are not unusual. There are also records of [other sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/14/instant-honey-mustard-from-cgm-384-i/) meant to be stored and carried by travellerrs, an interesting topic I wrote about a while ago on the [Oxford Symposium\u2019s blog](https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/bottling-status/).  Some of them are fanciful and probably  did not work, others look  practical and even delicious. This one is my current favourite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ground and ready for sifting](https://preview.redd.it/befd21bpgbzb1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3a8677ed6982c7a3430b5b888d907e6cad20070)\n\nThere are two problems with this recipe. The first is that I am not sure what *artickel* is. Suggestions have ranged from artichoke through *Primula auricula*  to a deliberately obscured spice. Ultimately, given the range of  ingredients in parallel recipes, I would suggest it is not very  important. The sauce works fine without whatever it is, and the general  class was versatile enough to make a great deal more variation  plausible. The second is that there are no proportions, so we do not  know how the flavours balanced. I played with quantities until I reached  a satisfying balance for my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook),  and this is largely the mix developed then, just with a little more  emphasis on the sharp spices for the coming cold and wet season.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Additional spices](https://preview.redd.it/w3j01nqqgbzb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bf91b09a65cfd7bdb44b5b52844b45da17ea130)\n\nTo prepare the spice mix, I took the opportunity to inaugurate the  vintage electric coffee mill I bought last year as my spice grinder and  was very happy with the results. Yes, that was historically done with a  mortar and that would produce a finer texture, but I do not have that  kind of time. The herbs, all thoroughly dried, were then easily reduced  to powder in a blender. The mix smelled delicious and works beautifully  when stirred up with a little vinegar and \u2013 an addition not mentioned in  the sources, but always favoured by me \u2013 salt. It is also likely to  last a long time if it is kept dry, but I intend to give it away  quickly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My new old kitchen toy](https://preview.redd.it/x0ol0w3sgbzb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4b7f1fb1ed34670a8d3bcc1a62c515ff5ad3dff)\n\nOne of the most extensive and interesting medieval recipe collections in  German is a manuscript dated 1460 and ascribed to one Meister Hans,  cook at the Wurttemberg court. It was often treated as a solitary, the  work of a single cook, but there are too many parallels with  contemporary manuscripts from Southern Germany to make this plausible.  The recipes are an eclectic mix, many terse and simple, others detailed  and sprinkled with anecdotes. The entire text was newly edited and  extensively commented for Tupperware Deutschland by Trude Ehlert:  Maister Hansen des von Wirtenberg Koch, Frankfurt (Main) 1996. I am  currently working on a full, commented translation to publish as a book.   \n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17rbxwz/instant_herb_sauce_powder_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1699533247.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17rbxwz/instant_herb_sauce_powder_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

This set of recipes is intreresting for two reasons. First, because it suggests that different ways of making the *Mus* were  common knowledge. Most other recipe sources describe a  single way  which could be read as disagreeing with each other. The unknown compiler  of these recipes understood that there are numerous ways of preparing a  given dish, not one true path. That marks a level of wisdom many modern  food bloggers have yet to attain. \n\nThe second interesting point is recipe #91. If I read it correctly,  it suggests that the recipes described here were also used with other  aromatic ingredients. You could flavour milk with other herbs and  flowers, no doubt. It looks like people did.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

{"title": "Chicken in a Crust (c. 1460)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/20/birthday-chicken/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/20/birthday-chicken/)\n\n I had the opportunity to try out several recipes for my birthday  get-together today, and the first one was a recipe in Meister Hans, the  next book project in the queue: \n\n***Recipe #219*** **Ain gepachens huon beraitt also**\n\n***Prepare baked chicken thus***\n\n***Item fill a chicken. Take eggs, bacon, and sage and  ginger between the flesh and the skin, and stick it on a spit. And  (prepare) an egg dough spread out with a rolling pin and wrap that  around the chicken. Let it roast (*****pratn*****) well and serve it whole, that is called a baked chicken.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vpvfrm3gbjb1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63493db47abd5dcc9fcb200ecbaa2f3792cd779c\n\n The recipe seems distantly related  to one in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf), though here the intent is clearly something simpler most likely baked in an oven:\n\n***66 Item you shall cut a chicken in half through the middle and make two flat pieces (*****fladen*****)  of flour and water and cut bacon into them, and add whole sage leaves  and pepper. Salt it in its measure. And cover it inside the flat dough  pieces. And let it bake like a bread (or a roast?*** **brade** ***\u2013 I suspect copyist error). These are pastry chickens (*****posteidenhoner*****).***\n\nThis is technically interesting, but fairly straighforward and I felt  sure it would taste good. I started with a rather small roasting  chicken from the halal butcher and began by preparing a \u201cdough of eggs\u201d.  The problem here was obviously that we don\u2019t know any of the other  ingredients. I erred on the side of caution, opting for just eggs,  water, flour, salt, and yeast. The result was a pliable, firm dough that  I could roll out thin and wrap around the chicken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hf3rqkp6gbjb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=107da2cb16f6913af2a8a1f81cc8b8b6f4ef39d9\n\n I decided to leaven the dough mainly because I expected it to work  better in an oven. There is no indication in the recipe one way or  another, and an argument from habit is unconvincing. Medieval cooks  leavened pasta, surely there is no reason to think they were bound to  our conventions one way or another. Nonetheless, I am fairly sure I am  wrong here. Had I mounted the chicken on a spit and regularly basted it  while roasting near a fire as the original recipe envisions, an  unleavened dough would have been infused with hot fat anjd effectively  fried, potentially producing a delicious crust. I would like to try that  out one day, but could not do so today.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nb7f2hj9gbjb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5351535bb9eac73a7a70cbb120dadc17eadfbe5\n\n Next, I prepared the filling. It was meant to go between the flesh and  the skin, a common enough technique to season and baste poultry, so the  quantity needed was not great. A paste of 2 teaspoons of dried sage  leaves,  125g of bacon, one egg, and a generous pinch of ginger filled  the cavity around the chicken\u2019s breast and thighs amply. Afterwards, I  wrapped the chicken in the dough and baked it at 175\u00b0C for 75 minutes.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9kxno3cgbjb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a20e0c18c2c27da6fe5efbb8fc17346360de15d0\n\n The result was excellent. The dough casing broke in one place, leaking  some juices, but it retained enough to produce a tender, succulent,  well-seasoned chicken.

The best present,  though, is that my translation of the Kuchenmaistrey is hitting the  market, albeit slowly. The print version is still listed as unavailable  unfortunately (physical production has its hangups, I guess), but the [e-book can already be bought](https://books2read.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach).\n\nTo mark the occasion, I am sharing one of the more interesting recipes from the Kuchenmaistrey today: Pastries the Italian way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5shckz5b4jb1.jpg?width=1531&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19be8eb7e30ff3268d81467f5c03478eced46b5f\n\n***3.xxv Item to make pastries in the Italian fashion (welchen sitten). Take good wheat flour and knead it with cold water. Beat (?buch) it under your hands so that it can be rolled out (welgen),  lay it in a mortar and pound it very well so that it becomes hard, and  throw a dusting of flour into it each (time) and when the flour has been  absorbed (vrzert), take it out and shape a pot (i.e. a coffin) out of it in an old cooking dish (hafen scherben)  or a glazed dish so that the dough and the container are of the same  width. (As) the dough is set into the container, you place warm butter  between the container and the dough coffin straightaway. Now a filling  goes into it made of eggs. Chicken broth. Milk or wine beaten well  together and seasoned with good spices and also with salt and chopped  parsley. Put all of that into the same dough coffin. And also pound  roasted or prepared forest birds into it. Or roast chickens, or boiled  (ones).***\n\n***Item the same boiled or roasted chickens, you cut them  apart nicely, limb from limb, entirely and properly. Thrust them (the  pieces) in (into the pastry filling) upright, or (pieces) of roast meat  or roast pears or of sausages roasted dry or boiled, or (do) the same  with what you have. And when they touch each other (******der ansto\u00df geschicht******), set the container by hot embers (******zu einer roschen gludt******) without smoke. At first push it towards the fire (?******des ersten feer herdan******)  and the more and more close (you move it) the filling begins to (turn)  white and the dough coffin begins to smoke (?). Then pour in warm butter  with the dough coffin so that the dough does not stick to the  container. And themn the filling cooks*** (**wirt bachen** ***\u2013 as in a  fritter), turn the container frequently so that it has the same heat,  and pour in half a spoonful of fat in occasionally (?yeleicht)  so that the filling is moist in proper measure. Make a clean wooden  skewer and thrust it into the container occasionally, all the way to the  bottom, so that the hot fat goes to the bottom. That way it will sizzle  and boil until the filling hardens, and that is nice enough.***\n\n***Then remove it from the fire and let the fat sink in.  lift the dough coffin out of the container and set it into a wide bowl  and cover it with a clean bowl. Thus bring it to the table for a king or  a prince. I keep quiet about common folk and poor men who would also  like to eat from this (probably misplaced here:*** **in ein dych werden**  ***to agree or become one). Also note that if you place the container by  the fire, you must cover it with a warm pan that is so wide as to cover  the container and the dough coffin well. If you do not have one, make a  sheet of the dough that the coffin is made from and cover it with the  sheet, or pin it to a board so that it does not fall closed (cover up  the coffin permanently) and (lift it to) see to it that the filling  settles and the dough coffin does not burn.***\n\nThe same cooking technique is described again in several other recipes, here using a dough of milk and eggs:\n\n***3.xxvi If you would make a good tart (turten),  have a care to have a clean pan as small or as large as you wish the  tart to be. Make a dough of milk and eggs, very strong, and roll it out  thin with a rolling pin. Measure it according to the pan so that it  hangs over the (edge of the) pan all around as much as a finger is  thick. Make a dough coffin (teigpfannen) in the pan and for  this, make a filling of beaten eggs, parsley, and fat, and also spices.  Beat this well together and put it into the dough coffin. Make a sheet  of dough (to go) over it and crimp (?*** **portel**) ***it shut as for a  fladen to that the excess dough (crimped rim) sticks out over the (edge  of the) pan. See that the pan has fat so that the dough coffin does not  burn. Frequently turn it around and around and let the tart bake. For  this, you need a broad, shallow pan. You may thrust shelled crawfish  into such a filling, or fish of pikes or basses or eel. See that these  must be firm, fresh fish, for the soft ones are not suitable because  they must first of all be boiled fully and seasoned with spices. When  the tart browns, it has had enough. Take it off the coals when the fire  and smoke make it burn and smell. Take it out, (set it) on a broad  platter and serve it.***\n\nAnd a description of the sound by which you gauge the progress:\n\n***3.xxvii Item a meat tart, make the dough as before or the  flappy dough (3.xxii) as is described earlier. Do not make the filling  too stiff, of eggs and wine or milk or chicken broth or good, tasty meat  broth, (but?) not much. Beat eggs and butter into it, salt and spice it  as before. Set the dough coffin (teigpfannen) into the pan and  pour fat between them all around so that the dough does not burn. Put  the filling into the dough coffin. If you have chicken or venison, all  boiled fully beforehand, or be it forest birds or roast meat, chop that  very nicely and add it to the filling. Make a dough cover over it and  crimp it (verrenftels) nicely and pour fat on the cover. Set  the pan on hot coals. At first (start with) a small fire, then more and  more. Frequently turn the pan so that the fat goes all around the dough  coffin until it sizzles (bratzelt) and bubbles (boppelt)  of boiling. When it is burning, you must prevent that with (adding)  fat. Thus the dough coffin is as good to eat as the filling (scharrn) within.***\n\nI am not entirely certain what qualifies this recipe as Italian and  thus aspirationally exotic, but I suspect it is the cooking technique  rather than the egg-based filling. Both are innovations \u2013 earlier pastry  recipes do not mention egg. However, cooking the crust in a richly  greased pan is far more interesting and has bigger implications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4fhdvkab4jb1.jpg?width=1531&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fa4759abb2ca21edf8f259f8be7735c8616bcc4\n\nContemporary cooks would have been aware of the fact that cooking  basic doughs in fat affected their flavour and consistency. A mix of  eggs, milk, or just water and flour will become crumblier and richer,  thus \u201cshort\u201d as in shortcrust, if it is fried in fat, but hard and  brittle if baked. This is a way of transferring that principle to pastry  crusts, and the result is something that feels a lot like a modern pie  crust. To us, the idea of greasing a pie pan and putting in a crust is  trivial, but when it was a new idea, it must have seemed decidedly odd.  It also required dedicated equipment and a good deal of attention. But  the result would have been worth it.\n\nThere is another instance of adding fat to a lean dough during the cooking process: [the \u2018Prophets\u2019 cake\u2019](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/12/continuity-and-change-in-sheet-cake/)  that is dotted with butter and baked in an oven. This would not have  been practical with pies and tarts, It is interesting, too, that the  technique does not show up in the sources for very long. Possibly that  is because it becomes commonplace. A lot of things are taken for  granted, and especially for pastries instructions are often perfunctory.  However, the sixteenth century is also when we get the first surviving  recipes for \u2018short\u2019 crusts including fat in the mix. Perhaps this is a  genuine transitional stage, that fata morgana of culinary history:  evidence of evolution towards a higher level.\n\nPersonally, I doubt the Whig narrative of cuisine, but I tried the  technique and found it gave satisfying results. It is important to apply  the fat liberally. Think of it as an ingredient, not just a grease film  to prevent the pastry from sticking. The temperature needs careful  regulating, something an electric oven makes easy, and the kitchen  should have a muscular fan or large windows, because the amount of  greasy steam this produces is impressive even if it does not burn. The  crust is quite good, soft and crumbly, and does not taste of the burned  butter the kitchen smelled of. But on balance, I can see why cooks would  prefer short crusts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15vp326/pastries_in_the_italian_fashion_1485_the_ebook_is/", "created_utc": 1692473060.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15vp326/pastries_in_the_italian_fashion_1485_the_ebook_is/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

To head off any issues with international shipping  charges and unreliable mail, it will be available both as a printed copy  and as an e-book. Orders will be accepted as soon as the print version  is ready to go at [Ellipsis website](https://www.ellipsis.cx/~liana/ellipsisimprints/ourbooks.html#km).\n\n[Cover design with a feasting scene from the Hausbuch der Mendelschen Zw\u00f6lfbr\u00fcderstiftung, Nuremberg](https://preview.redd.it/2eugik9p2zab1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6382d32d018b3159cb50a50293bee7584e56306)\n\nThe Kuchenmaistrey (mastery of the kitchen) was the first printed  cookbook in German and the second one in all of Europe, predated only by  Platina in Italy. It is one of the most important sources for elite  cuisine in the later 15th and early 16th centuries, and many of its  roughly 190 recipes can still be prepared with quite satisfying results.  This is not a properly annotated, academic translation, but it is the  first time it appears in English at all.\n\nTo add to my reasons for happiness, Ellipsis has also expressed an  interest in further translated cookbooks, so I am hoping to see more of  them in actual print. However, between my day job, my son, my other book  contract and life in general, this means I will not be able to return  to posting daily recipes for the foreseeable future. I apologise for  this and hope you can see there is a good reason.\n\nToday, I will leave you with another recipe from the Kuchenmaistrey.  It is not entirely clear what it is meant to achieve, but I think Trude  Ehlert is right interpreting it as a way of simulating sauerkraut.\n\n***4. xxvi. Item if you would quickly make good,  well-tasting cold compost cabbage in autumn as it is first chopped from  the head raw. Take a clean pot and spread out small wooden skewers into  it a hand high. Pour good red wine into it up to the skewers, but not  quite. Then take a cabbage head well soured (?*** **geschwert**) ***and  cut it into four quarters almost to the base, but so that it stays  together there. Lay another cabbage head on it so that it opens out.  Thus invert the cabbage onto the skewers in the pot, cover it up well  and close up the lid with dough (mu\u00df). Set in on a trivet and  make an even fire under it that is not too large. And let it stand there  as long as cabbage may otherwise cook.***\n\n***Then take it out and let it cool. And take the red wine  in the pot and put it into a small pan, and boil caraway, sloes and  juniper berries in it. Pour it into the cabbage head. Split it well all  around and let it fall apart, and then split it completely. Pour vinegar  or mustard on it and serve it.***\n\nIt is clear that this recipe is supposed to simulate something that  is not yet in season \u2013 compost cabbage, specifically. That can refer to  mixed [pickled ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/12/compost-recipes-from-cgm-384-i/)[fruit ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/20/side-dishes-for-the-goose-roast/)and [vegetables](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/05/hohtz-kraut-from-cod-pal-germ-551/), but also simply to sauerkraut, and in this case it seems to mean the latter. Sauerkraut would, of course, be[ salted down in autumn](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/26/making-sauerkraut-from-the-oeconomia/)  as  cabbage became available and ripened in casks over the  coming  months. Thus, there would be none during the cabbage harvest, and this  recipe seems designed to remedy that lack.\n\nThe instructions are fairly straightforward: A head of cabbage is  quartered and held open by another. Both are then suspended over boiling  wine to be steamed. After they are cooked, the wine is reduced with a  selection of spices  \u2013 caraway and juniper berries seem suitable  additions to sauerkraut while sloes, in season in late autumn, would  provide tartness. Finally, the dish is served with vinegar or mustard. A  problem with interpreting it hinges on the word *geschwert*. It could be interpreted as \u201cweighed down\u201d, but also be a typographical error meant to represent *gesuwert* \u2013 soured \u2013 or even *gesubert* \u2013  cleaned \u2013 each of which would make it something rather different. Trude  Ehlert looked into this in her edition of m,anuscript versions of the  early print work, and she found the word differs in various versions of  the Kuchenmaistry. If we read it as *ges(u)wert* \u2013 soured or  fermented \u2013 we have sauerkraut being cooked. Cabbage was often fermented  in entire heads, so that is not a problem for this reading. However,  the K\u00f6ln MS has *gesubert* \u2013 cleaned \u2013 which would imply raw cabbage, more in keeping with the first sentence. The Solothurn MS has *gesotten*, boiled, which is slightly confusing, but not impossible.\n\nI would go with raw, properly cleaned cabbage heads because it seems  most plausible in the light of the first sentence \u2013 a way of making  sauerkraut at a time when it would not be available seasonally. But that  is, admittedly, speculative.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/14v3zs8/forthcoming_book_and_mock_sauerkraut_1485/", "created_utc": 1688922873.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/14v3zs8/forthcoming_book_and_mock_sauerkraut_1485/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Congratulations on your book!

Today, I sent off corrections to the proofs of the  *Kuchenmaistrey* to the publisher, so good things are happening. For today, from Meister Hans:\n\n***Recipe #10*** **Sulcz von veygn**\n\n ***Galantine of figs***\n\n***Item as galantine of figs, if you wish to make this, take  a pound of figs.

Season it with good spices and  saffron, and see that there is not too much of the broth, (just) so that  the figs are covered.***\n\nThis will no doubt make an attractive dish to serve discerning  guests. Dried figs (fresh would not have been available in Nuremberg)  were softened by boiling, then arranged in a serving bowl and encased in  a richly spiced jelly.

By contemporary  lights, though, this was highly fashionable and noteworthy cuisine:  Almonds and sugar were both luxury ingredients, and the process of  blanching the almonds and turning them into almond milk required a good  deal of time and skill. White foods in general carried status because  they were uncommon. Before industrial refining processes, almost nothing  in the kitchen was white, and milk, cheese, flour, rice, or sugar had  to be processed to get them there. Gelatin, too, was a relatively new  and interesting ingredient that cooks were still exploring. Finally, in a  world of strict Lenten fasts the idea of having cheese on the table on  fast days was a novelty in itself. The appeal must have been enormous.\n\nOne of the most extensive and interesting medieval recipe  collections in German is a manuscript dated 1460 and ascribed to one  Meister Hans, cook at the Wurttemberg court.

And when you take them out, put grated  cheese on them and also fat and salt etc.***\n\nThe first such recipe is not unusual in any way. Such green tarts  were commonplace in the Italian tradition and beyond it. The word  itself, *durte(n)* or *torte(n)*, derives from *torta*,  a fine baked good whose origin is hard to pin down. All of this was  very likely well familiar in Germany by the mid-fifteenth century. The  reference to baking (or frying \u2013 the word bach is ambiguous) in a pan  may refer to the eponymous *tortenpfanne*, one of the central  implements of the Renaissance kitchen. This pan was shaped to hold one  pie or tart and could be placed in the embers with a lid designed to  hold hot coals for heat from the top and bottom.\n\nThe second recipe is even more interesting. We begin with the same  filling \u2013 chard, cheese, fat, and eggs \u2013 and wrap it in sheets, here  clearly meaning sheets of dough, the way that krapfen fritters are made.  They are then boiled, not fried, and served with grated cheese. Such  recipes show up regularly in later sources where they are usually known  as \u2018boiled *krapfen*\u2018, but here, they are called *rabel*. That is not a familiar German word, but it is easy to see the derivation from *ravioli*. Again, this type of recipe would be entirely unexceptional in any Italian recipe collection.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

They were  fried in a flat crepe pan and carefully transferred to flap plates, and  once the sheets had  cooled, they were gratifyingly easy to handle. \n\nFor the filling, I cooked down apples with a little sugar and spices  to produce a thick paste like the apple-honey sauce known as dewericz  (Meister Hans #82): \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4k8zfk02n4b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8096f56d7604d78d39337a2b47ac024c6d9251ca\n\n***Recipe #82*** **Ain Condiment haist dewericz**  \n***A sauce that is called*** **dewericz** ***Item take a sour apple after St Martin\u2019s Day (11 November), peel them and cut them apart.

You may also fill*** **krapfen** ***(small pastries) with it.***\n\nThis is probably not the same thing as the \u2018roast apples\u2019 in the  recipe, but I thought it would be close enough to be acceptable.

I spread  the apple sauce on the first white egg sheet, laid a yolk sheet on top,  more sauce, another white, and so on until five layer were assembled.  Then I rolled them up and secured the roll with toothpicks. The original  would now have been sliced and assembled into brows on skewers. Since I  had neither long enough skewers nor a pan big enough to accommodate  them, I fried the pieces singly instead. After coating them in a [leavened batter of egg, milk and flour](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/04/figuring-out-straubenteig/), I transferred them to a pan at a medium heat, quite ready to see them fall apart.

That part was a disappointment. I think I failed to roll them  tightly enough, and quite possibly the sauce was too watery. They were  enjoyable \u2013 flavourful and rich, with a crunchy exterior \u2013 but the  visual effect that the original was to achieve eluded me.

Cut each one into four parts. Heat  fat in a pan and stir it in that, then put it in a mortar that is hot  and has a little fat in it. Cover it above and put coals on it that are  fresh, and let it fry in that.***\n\n This is the kind of pancake or m,ortar  cake we find in many sources,  a mixture of eggs and breadcrumbs fried in plenty of fat. It is not  unattractive, especially if you are hungry and cold, but it is a very  basic dish of no particular distinction. What makes this version stand  out is the specific quantity of spice that is given: four whole nutmegs.  We very rarely have any quantities  given, and this one is not only  exact, but preposterous. \n\nthe reciope is not entirely clear on many points. First of all, we do  not really know how much bread and egg goes into the mix, so it is hard  to say exactly how heavily spiced it would be. However, recipes for  other dishes cooked in mortars (not least [May Cake](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/16/another-may-cake/))  indicate we are not talking about very large quantities. The other  question is what exactly happens with the nutmegs. The recipe would  support the idea that the pieces are fried in the fat and then possibly  removed. The problem with that interpretation is that nutmeg cut into  the filling is a recurring theme in parallel recipes for [Mortar Cake](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/02/mortar-cakes-from-cod-pal-germ-551/),  and in one case the text specifies three. It seems that this dish was  just very nutmeg-y. It is an open question how much of this  cake would  be eaten by a single person in one sitting. The quantity is still [unlikely to induce nutmeg poisoning](https://www.drugs.com/npp/nutmeg.html), but it certainly must have been an intense experience.  \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

Leave on the feet and the neck, and  chop the rest of the meat and season it. Pus the feet into the glass one  after another and then fill in the meat by the neck above. Set the  glass by the coals, thus it boils. But you must sew the skin shut before  you put it into the glass etc.***\n\nClearlky this belongs to a class of recipes that illustrate the joy  medieval cooks found in playing with food. Neither is it a solitary. We  find a more detailed description in [Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-Meister-Hans.pdf):\n\n***Recipe #230 Von aimen gannczen huon ganncz und gar in ainem Anngster***\n\n***Of a whole chicken entirely inside a narrow-necked bottle***\n\n***Item how you should put a chicken entirely inside a narrow-necked glass bottle. Take and scald the chicken but not too much (verpr\u00fce das nicht)  so that its skin remains whole. Take it and remove its skin and blow  into the skin and where it is broken and has a hole, sew it shut again.  And take the meat and boil it, and when it has boiled enough, chop it  small mixed together with sage and parsley.***\n\n***Take a blunt (piece of) wood and thrust the skin into the  glass jar or narrow-necked bottle and blow up the skin inside the glass  vessel, and put the filling into the glass vessel in it (into the  skin). As you put the skin in (to the glass), leave the neck sticking  out and tie it shut well and attach it over the glass vessel (tuck it  under the rim?) so that no steam or water may enter it. When you pull  off  the skin all the way to the feet, you must cut off a little there.***\n\n***So do all that is written above, and set it in a pot so  that the water stands above the chicken and the glass the depth of a  finger across (a finger\u2019s breadth), and let it boil. Thus it hardens so  that one sees an entire chicken inside the glass vessel, and then serve  it***.\n\nThe recipe collection ascribed to [Meister Eberhard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Meister-Eberhard-translation-revised.pdf) also includes a fragment of a recipe (#16) that looks very similar:\n\n***\u2026pot and pour water to it and cover it and let it boil,  so it will stretch inside the glass jar, so that you can see its foot  and wing and the whole body. That way it is well done.***\n\nThis method of cooking and serving chickens seems to have been  fam,iliar ernough in the later fifteenth century to inspire a simulation  that, as far as I can see, dispenses with the need for actual glassware  and thus the risk of destroying something expensive. The [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf) instructs:\n\n***28 Item if you would make entire chickens in a glass, have earthen glasses (glazed pots) made in the shape of a*** **klucglaze** ***(a narrow-necked drinking glass, also known as an*** **angster** ***or*** **engster**),  ***two fingers wide at the top. Take young chickens. Make then ready  properly as young chickens you intend to fill. Cut them open at the  neck, not in front, (but ?) where their wings are. Take out the meat and  the bones there so that the skin stays whole. Cook the meat until done.  Take out the bones***.\n\n***Make a good filling from the meat of raisins and of eggs  and bacon and spices. Close up the skin again where you took out the  meat as skilfully as you can, with a piece of thread or with a skewer.  And the forward limb shall stay (attached) to the skin and the feet.  (leave the wings, lower legs and feet on). Bring the skin back (probably  misplaced here) into the glazed vessel. Fill the filling back into the  skin to the mouth of the container, and do not overfill it. Set it in a  cookpot and let it boil (so) that no water enters into the container.  When you think that it is done, take the whites of eggs. Colour it  yellow or green, as you will. Pour (swirl) it around, back and forth,  that which is in the glass. Set it in a cookpot so that no water comes  into it. When it is done, break apart the earthen glass (glazed  container) and serve it. And serve ginger and wine with it for a sauce (sot).***\n\nIt seems as though the idea here was to simulate the appearance of a  chicken in a glass jar, but to serve it without the surrounding  container. Since the only practical way to eat it seems to be breaking  the glass, that makes sense as an economy measure, but it would only  work if the diners were familiar enough with the idea to understand what  they were seeing as a simulation of the real thing.\n\nThe enduring popularity of this little conceit is demonstrated by its recurrence in the 1550s in the [recipe collection of Sabina Welser](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Sabrina_Welserin.html)  (#2). Interestingly, while there is a clear idea of the look you want,  there is no real agreement on what it is to taste like. The Innsbruck MS  just says to season the meat. Sabina Welser\u2019s recipe instructs the cook  to add egg, spices, and saffron. The Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch has  bacon and raisins, much as  it does in its[ boneless chicken](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/21/gefilte-chicken/).  Meister Hans, interestingly, goes with sage and parsley, which could be  quite attractive and modern. It is impossible to ascribe any of these  recipes the title of an \u2018original\u2019 from which another derives. Very  likely this is a tradition that focuses on the visual effect \u2013 a glass  jar visibly containing a cooked chicken with the neck and head sticking  out \u2013 and considers the actual flavour secondary.\n\nThe shape of the glass jar is an open question. An [angster, kuttrolf, or klucglas](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angster_(Glas))  today describes a very complex kind of bottle with a narrow and twisted  neck designed to produce audible gurgling when wine was poured out. It  is highly unlikely this is what the recipes mean. More likely, we are  talking about a narrow-necked bottle or jar, probably made of fairly  thick and impure [Waldglas ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_glass)as was most regular glassware in fifteenth-century Germany.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.

The main  principle at work seems to be the way the meat is served \u2013 cut into  small pieces, roasted, and presented in a spicy sauce. [Even cooked egg](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/14/egg-loaf-roast-from-the-innsbruck-ms/) can be considered credible as \u2018venison\u2019 if it is treated this way. It probably makes sense to think of *wildprat*  as  a category of dish, much like \u201chamburger\u201d in our modern world, that  can be approximated without the  principal ingredient if it is  presented correctly.

The mention of  \u2018roasting\u2019 it may suggest a choux paste, something that was known at the  time. I have yet to find a recipe for *hasenorel* from the time, so I cannot draw on that. The next question is the *taig* to  be made. Aichholzer reads this as a dough covering, but the same word  is also used elsewhere for an egg-based pastry filling. Finally, I do  not understand the role that the pot is supposed to play. Could itz  merely indicate that cooking the same filling in a pot would produce  equally appealing results?

Prepare chopped  meat with this (*****ein gehackt von fleisch*****) and mix them together. Then take the forehead bones (*****hirren pain*****)  both. Put the brain into them and wrap them in a sheet of eggs. Wrap  the chopped meat around the other bones and roast them. Then spice them  and do not oversalt them. When they are roasted, serve them roasted or  prepare a*** **ziseindel** ***sauce or a*** **pfefferlein** ***sauce etc.***\n\nThis is the kind of showy, complex dish that would have shown up on  the table of someone who had hunting rights, a skilful cook, and  resources to spare. I suspect it is based on a deer  head that was  boiled until the meat could be plucked off the bones and the fully  cooked brain removed from the skull. Here, the skull is already opened,  the brain prepared with a pastry casing, and the meat turned into a  soft, spicy meat loaf that is then moulded around the bone and cooked a  second time. The whole thing must have looked quite impressive if it was  prepared by  a skilled sculptor. It also seems to have been a popular  recipe at least in theory as it [shows up again in Cod Pal Germ 551, both A and B](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/17/roe-deer-head-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/).   \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

This winter, I was surprised by an  e-mail from Marta Sikorska, a Polish culinary histoirian of  some  renown. She had extended an invitation to a culinary symposium hosted by  the [Instytut Polski in D\u00fcsseldorf](https://instytutpolski.pl/duesseldorf/).  It was part of a cycle following the seasons, and its topic was  springtime in the Polish and German culinary traditions. Several eminent  food scholars, among us Regina Frisch, Anna Mikolajewska, Josef  Matzerath and Peter Peter, would meet to exchange ideas, present on our  chosen subjects, and each provide a recipe to be combined into a menu.  These recipes were forwarded to Maciej Nowicki, chef and head of  culinary history education at the [Wilanow Royal Palace](https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/palace.html) who provided modern interpretations which we [tried out together](https://www.instagram.com/p/CriVmfsoU4D/?hl=en) in the kitchen of the [Restaurant Agata\u2019s](https://www.agatas.de/cms/).  The following evening, we were all called on to present our work to an  appreciative audience at the museum Schloss Benrath while the kitchen  team from Wilanow provided samples for tasting. It was a most excellent  two days, and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to meet all these  fascinating people in person. \n\n \n\n[ May Cake in bite-sized  shells, decorated with fresh flowers as per the libellus de lacte ](https://preview.redd.it/cofwbow3sgya1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc72bf22d91ec05b69e5e13d49d8b9072ace6e73)\n\nThe recipe I presented was not new, but it recommended itself both  for its seasonal context and its association with Poland via Prussia. [May Cake](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/09/may-cake-a-herbal-tart/) has [already ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/06/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-i/)[featured ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/13/may-cake-from-meister-eberhard/)on this blog [several ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/22/may-cake-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)[times](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/10/may-cake-from-cod-pal-germ-551/),  from its  plain origins in the fifteenth century to its complex  incarnation in the sixteenth. The version that was chosen for  interpretation came from the recipe collection of Sabina Welser: \n\n***176 Take a pound of raisins, a pound of wine berries,  five small pieces of May butter, a handful of hyssop, a handful of  ground ivy (glechoma hederacea), some sage, about ten leaves, twice the  amount of mint, a handful of costmary, about fifteen eggs and a half  pound of sugar. The herbs are chopped, baked for two hours. The batter  must be stirred with the herbs. For the bottom, two eggs, it must be  made as though for a tart.***\n\n \n\n[ A perfect bite ](https://preview.redd.it/teblhdj6sgya1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db9cce9e13dc00265f788016310e00718c938049)\n\nI had made this before, but then it was as part of an Easter feast  and did not play a major role. At the hands of a master cook, it turned  into something very different. A creamy custard in a  crisp case rested  on violet honey and caramelised nuts, with the raisins in a sweet sauce.  Fresh flowers for decoration were inspired by the [*cibus Maiis*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/15/biscotti-and-may-dish-for-a-vigil/) in the libellus de lacte, another of my favourite recipes to serve as a springtime treat.\n\nIt was not, of course, a historically accurate interpretation. The  filling would have been much more strongly seasoned with herbs and green  from their juices. The dried fruit belonged in the cake, not alongside,  and neither honey nor nuts feature in the original recipe. In a way,  though, Maciej Nowicki did exactly what the cooks of the Welser family  had done five centuries ago: He translated an interesting recipe into  the grammar of contemporary hauite cuisine. Once this had  called for  raisins, figs, and sugar. Today, it requires an artful arrangement of  complementing parts. And it was very good indeed. To my great regret, I  had to leave the celebration just as the conversation became animated to  catch a late train home. I would have loved to stay, to talk, enjoy the  evening air and \u2013 have one or two more of these May Cakes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/13b0tvz/a_culinary_history_seminar/", "created_utc": 1683489207.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/13b0tvz/a_culinary_history_seminar/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

This recipe, too, I suspect survives mainly because of  the description of the stack of dough sheets. This is one aspect that  interests me and I think I would like to play with come winter. The  first obvious problem is to decide what the *pletter*  of eggs  are. The word can refer to leaves or  sheets, and I suspect it means a  kind of pancake here. However, it could also mean a more robust kind of  egg dough, something like fresh pasta. It sounds very vaguely like a  kind of yellow-dyed pork lasagna, and the jelly from the head\u2019s  connective tissues would make it  hold together quite firmly. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

These  worms are the thickness of a finger and about two thumbs in length, and I  can find no better comparison than a piece of capon fat wrapped in a  very soft and transparent skin. One does not notice any noble parts in  the bodies of these animals, nor entrails or intestines, not even if the  animal is cut in two and inspected with a crystal magnifying glass. The  head is black and attached to the body with no indication of a neck.***\n\n***The manner of preparing them is to stick them on small  wooden skewers and to turn them in front of the fire. As they begin to  heat, they are powdered with a breading (croute) of grated  bread, salt, a little pepper and nutmeg. That powder retains the fat it  soaks up. When they are cooked, they are dressed with orange or lemon  juice. This is very good and delicate food once you have overcome the  repugnance one normally feels at the idea of eating worms, more so if  you have seen them alive.***\n\n***There is also another manner of preparing them, which is  to put them in a casserole or small earthenware pot with wine, spices, a  bouquet of herbs, some leaves of allspice, and orange peels.***\u201d\n\nThese *vers de palmiste* or palm grubs were most likely the larvae of the Central American palm weevil [Rhynchophorus palmarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynchophorus_palmarum).  They were very likely part of the Native American diet since  pre-Columbian times the same way that related species of palm grubs were  and are eaten in Central Africa and Southeast Asia. The European  tradition, though, makes almost no culinary use of insects and has a  strong taboo against eating them which Father Labat clearly shares in  the form of his \u201crepugnance\u201d.\n\nGiven the lively culinary interest evident from his work, it is not  surprising Labat tried them. He would eat anything that didn\u2019t actively  jump off the plate. What is more striking is the preparation: The grubs  are breaded with a spicy panade, a very European tradition that has no  parallel I know of in either Africa or Central America. Alternatively,  they are cooked in wine with spices and fine herbs, another European way of doing things. This matches the way New World ingredients were [often adopted in Europe itself](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/06/guinea-pig-recipes-from-marx-rumpolt/):  They were taken up and used the way familiar, similar things were.  Obviously more than one European, including those of high enough status  to afford imported wine and bread, decided that if you were going to eat  worms, you might as well do it properly.\n\nNone of this means that the buccaneers ate palm grubs, but it is hard  to argue they would not at least have been aware of the option. We know  they harvested cabbage palms while ashore, and the grubs are frequently  found inside these plants. It is not likely they had the wine and fine  herbs on hand to make a proper ragout, but roasted, breaded and spiced  these are easy to imagine eaten in a buccaneer camp.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12itkhn/cooking_palm_grubs_according_to_p\u00e8re_labat_late/", "created_utc": 1681239144.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12itkhn/cooking_palm_grubs_according_to_p\u00e8re_labat_late/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Season it well  and beat egg yolks into it, then make it as thick as a side dish (gem\u00fcez) and do not oversalt it.***\n\n***8 If you would make a puree of sweet cherries (chersen), make it in the same way as the tart cherry puree and do not oversalt it etc.***\n\n***9 If you would make a puree of damsons (krichen m\u00fcez), also prepare it in the same manner as the first.***\n\n***10 If you would make strawberry puree (erper m\u00fcz), also make it in the way etc.***\n\n***11 If you would make a puree of brambles (praper)*** **farnts** ***(?) etc.***\n\n***12 If you would make a puree of spilling plums (Prunus domestica ssp pomariorum,*** **spendling m\u00fcz**),  ***take the spilling plums, pour on a little water, and boil them so that  the stones fall out.

Then bring it to a  boil and prepare it like the other purees (*****m\u00fceser*****) and do not oversalt it.***\n\nVarious fruit purees thickened with bread and/or egg were a staple of  medieval German cuisine, and we  find a lot of recipes scattered across  many sources, including [one from the Kuchenmaistrey](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/10/cherry-porridge-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) and several in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf). They are very similar to others for sauces, but are clearly meant as dishes in their own right and referred to as *Mus*,  the catchall term for spoonable, but not liquid foods. We need not  imagine them as sweet dessert foods, though their descendants today are.  The distinction between a savoury main course and a sweet dessert did  not yet exist at the time. Fruit purees could be served as side dishes  to a meat or fish course, or as a course of their own.\n\nThe distinction between tart cherries \u2013 the *Weichseln* that could be foraged in the wild \u2013 and sweet cherries \u2013 the *Kirschen* or *Amerellen* that  were always cultivated in gardens \u2013 was very clear in medieval recipes.

He  brought her the roast donkey which she thought noble venison (*****willpr\u00e4t edel*****).  She drew a loaf of bread against her chest and cut it straight through  the middle. Behold, those were some honest slices! She laid them in a  proud heap like a stack of firewood. None dared take away the knife from  her, so they tore the meat destined for her into pieces. All was hers,  and she swallowed (*****schland*****) the roast and gnawed the bones. She  chewed and gnawed so hard a tooth broke in her mouth. What would be  left for the dogs? They were discontent with her gnawing, and one jumped  up and took a bone from her mouth, but she kept eating and eating until  she had caught up with the other guests.***\n\nPeople and dogs gnawing on bones are so much part of the sterotypical  medieval feast it is surprising to see how rarely that kind of thing is  actually described. Here, it is made explicit, and the context makes it  clear that it\u2019s not approved behaviour. The [Wahre Hoveschheit](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hoveschheit-Translation.pdf), a book of table manners, states clearly: \n\n***You must not gnaw bones like a dog. You must not suck out the marrow like a honey bear sucks his paw.***\n\nThe other faux pas that is committed here is cutting bread while  holding the loaf against the chest. This is a bigger problem than it  appears at first glance: Bread was a central element of any medieval  meal, and though it was often served in a prepared state, with the crust  removed partly or entirely, it had to be cut by the diners. There were  no cutting boards as far as we know, and no serrated bread knives of  ther kind we rely on today. Cutting bread neatly and precisely under  these circumstances is hard. Though upper-class men were generally  expected to master the skill of cutting bread held in their hand as part  of a broader education of carving at the table, this was not universal  practice. Interestingly, the Hoveschheit dedicates an entire paragraph  to it: \n\n***One custom exists at court that is sometimes harmful;  cutting bread holding it in your hands sometimes leads to harm. It  happened at a prince\u2019s court that a young gentleman wanted to cut his  bread in his hand and cut himself in the hand so badly that he died of  the wound. All of his family mourned. Thereupon the prince gave  permission to all his court that each man and woman were to cut their  bread holding it against their chest. You have the same permission to  cut your bread against your chest when you need to. A harmful custom  should be changed.***\n\nThe anecdote is sometimes associated with Valdemar IV Atterdag of  Denmark, but it is irrelevant whether or not that is how it happened.  Anyone accustomed to eating Br\u00f6tchen for breakfast knows the risk of  slicing into the palm of your hand  when cutting them in half. It\u2019s a  familiar injury in emergency wards throughout the country.  So at least  in this regard, Else is on the right side of history.\n\nThe donkey meat, a repellent thought to contemporary German  audiences, is explained by an event that occurred the previous evening:\n\n***They paraded around the village of Lappenhausen that  night as well as they could, making noise with drums. Those who could  not lodge in a house took the sky for a roof and the street for a  feather bed. Behold, they passed up and down all night with shouting so  that nobody could sleep, neither in the hay nor in the straw. This  continued until dawn. They permitted nobody to carry a candle, and the  bridegroom suffered damage that way because he skinned his donkey  instead of the cow by mistake and carried the meat into the kitchen.  This would never have been known if he had found his donkey in the place  where (instead) he saw the skin lying the next morning to his great  dismay.***\n\nThe intenjse, noisy fun on the eve of a wedding that is  institutionalised as the Polterabend today clearly has long antecedents.  Of course the idea that anyone, least of all a peasant familiar with  livestock, would mistake a donkey for a cow in the dark is laughable.  Even if that were to happen, it is hard to see how one would go about  slaughtering, skinning, and butchering a large animal in the dark. We  need to remember that though it has elements of reality, this story is  not supposed to be realistic. \n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem \u201aDer Ring\u2018 (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself to  translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners, but  would advise anyone with enough command of German to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11vuthy/how_not_to_eat_meat_and_slice_bread_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1679253738.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11vuthy/how_not_to_eat_meat_and_slice_bread_15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

If you do not wish to have isinglass in it, you shall also leave out  the water and cook calves\u2019 feet and use the same broth in place of water  and isinglass. Boil cut-up cinnamon in wine and pass (strain) it  through a haircloth into the jelly broth (Gallertbrueh), season it with sugar, and put in it two or three pewter bowls. But also put some of the jelly broth (Gallertbrueh) in small serving bowls (Commentlein). When the jelly sets (bestehet),  you sit (work?) with the small bowls and drip it (their content) onto  the other jelly with a feather so the drops do not run together.***\n\n***2 Item in summer you boil lamb\u2019s or sheep\u2019s feet in wine  and the third part water. Then you boil whole cinnamon and mace in wine  and pass it through a haircloth over the feet. You also well add  rosewater and sugar, pour it into a silver (dish), set red jelly into a  small bowl (Commentlein) by the fire and drip it on this jelly.***\n\n***3 Item you boil dates, anise and cinnamon in wine, pass it through a haircloth, prepare it with sugar and isinglass (Bestande) or calves\u2019 feet, pour it into a silver (dish) and let it get cold etc.***\n\n***4 Item you pound figs and unsugared coriander in a mortar  and then boil it in wine and a third part water with mace, and pass it  through a haircloth. Add sugar and isinglass and set it on the fire, but  so it does not boil up. Wash small raisins in water, set them on the  fire with rosewater and sugar, and then arrange these raisins along the  edge (of the bowl) around this jelly.***\n\n***5 Item you peel sweet Seville oranges (*****suesse Pomerantzen**  ***\u2013 probably the less bitter kind, not actual sweet oranges) and cook  them in water, isinglass, and wine with mace and sugar. Pass it through a  haircloth so that it chills in a silver (dish). Then take a little in a  small dish (Commentlein), mix it with saffron, and drip it on the other jelly with a feather. Lay candied orange peel around the edge.***\n\n***6 You pound almonds small and pass them through a  haircloth with water and wine that cinnamon has been boiled in. Prepare  it with isinglass and sugar and also with rosewater, if you wish to have  that with it. Drip it with yellow or red jelly.***\n\n***7 You boil plums (Schwetzken), pour off the  broth, pass it through a haircloth, season it with pounded cinnamon,  ginger, sugar, and isinglass, and when it sets, drip it with white  jelly. This jelly is good for the sick because it is good and laxative (laxiert).***\n\n***8 Item you boil plums in water and wine, pass them  through a haircloth, prepare them with mace, sugar, lavender or rose  water,. And isinglass, decorate (*****belegt*****) it with small preserved*** (**eingemacht** ***\u2013 probably cooked and sugared) muscatel pears and drip it with white or yellow jelly.***\n\n***9 You pass through currants (S. Johansbirn) or  the mus of them through a haircloth with wine and water and prepare it  with rosewater, sugar, and isinglass or calves\u2019 foot broth. When it  sets, drip it with the same broth.***\n\n***10 Item you boil mace, whole cinnamon, and coriander or anise in wine etc.***\n\n***11 Item you prepare a jelly of cherry*** **mus** ***and wine. Add water when it is thick*** **(starck**) ***and add sugar cinnamon, and isinglass that was passed through a cloth (*****durchgeschlagen*****) so that it becomes quite sweet with the sugar. Afterwards, drip it with the same broth.***\n\n***12 Item you boil cardamom, sugar, and isinglass in cherry*** **mus**, ***let it run through a haircloth and drip it with the same broth.***\n\n***13 Item you boil wine, water, mace, sugar, isinglass, and  saffron together, pass it through a haircloth and drip it with red  jelly.***\n\n***14 Item you boil cinnamon, saffron and isinglass, pass it  through a haircloth, season it with sugar and washed small raisins and  drip it with pale (bleichem) jelly.***\n\n***15 Item you roast quinces in the ashes, let them cool,  pass them through a haircloth with wine and water, and prepare them with  whole mace, sugar, and isinglass.***\n\n***16 Item you cut up green fennel, pound it, and pass it  through a haircloth with wine and water. Melt isinglass, add sugar and  rosewater, and stir it together with the green juice. Then take it off  the fire immediately (stracks), pour it into a silver (dish), and drip it with red jelly.***\n\n***17 Item you boil nutmeg, sugar, small raisins, isinglass,  and almonds cut small in red wine. Let it cool and stick it with  almonds.***\n\n***18 Item boil red wine, nutmeg, sugar, a little ginger,  cardamom, isinglass, and lavender water together and drip bit with red,  white, or green jelly.***\n\n***19 Item you melt isinglass, pass it through a haircloth, and prepare it with mulberry juice (Maulbirnsafft), sugar, and rosewater. Drip it with red jelly.***\n\nThese are clearly sweet jellies the way we would understand the  concept. The description as \u2018cool\u2019 (kuehl) most likely refers to their  humoral effect, cooling and soothing in the heat. The way they are   presented is mostly fairly basic, set in serving bowls, though we will  see a more elaborate recipe later. I find the idea of decorating the  surface of the set jelly with drops in a contrasting colour interesting,  but find it hard to imagine what it would actually look like. Clearly,  it was a complex operation. The cook was expected to keep small bowls of  varicoloured jellies on hand to melt as needed to decorate others. It  may be worth trying come summer.\n\nFranz de Rontzier, head cook to the bishop of Halberstadt and duke of Braunschweig, published his encyclopaedic *Kunstbuch von mancherley Essen* in 1598. He clearly looks to Marx Rumpolt\u2019s *New Kochbuch*  as the new gold standard, but fails to match it in engaging style or  depth. He is thus overshadowed by the twin peaks of Marx Rumpolt and  Anna Wecker. What makes his work interesting is the way in which he  systematically lists versions of a class of dishes, illustrating the  breadth or a court cook\u2019s repertoire. He is also more modernly  fashionable than Rumpolt. Looking to France rather than Italy and Spain  for inspiration, and some of the dishes he first describes may be  genuine innovations.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10r4yss/renaissance_jelly_recipes_1598/", "created_utc": 1675282821.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10r4yss/renaissance_jelly_recipes_1598/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

It  was  a  proof-of-concept test of the \u2018[Snow](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/10/snow-a-whipped-cream-dish/)\u2018 recipe I posted a week ago:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zzco94t2vuca1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a464bc6071782b03d024d4d5d99dc03caa277caf\n\n***52 To make Snow***\n\n***Take a*** **semmel** ***loaf, cut it apart, and you may also coat it in egg. Roast it over the coals. Take the egg batter*** (**airtaig** ***\u2013  probably the almond mixture) as for marcepan, spread it on the roasted  semmel and slice it, not quite one finger thick. Lay the slices on a  bowl so that the almond is toasted. Then take thick milk, as thick as  possible, add a handful of sugar and beat it in a pot, thus it develops a  foam. Place the foam on the slices with the almond that are toasted so  that the almond batter rises. Make a high foam, thus it melts below and  the bread softens. Thus you have good snow.***\n\nThe recipe is not entirely clear and I was mainly aiming to work out  the flavour profile here, but it was very interesting and definitely  something I want to repeat. My initial reading was that this would  involve bread soakled in egg and toasted, then spread with *airtaig* \u2013  the kind of egg-bound almond paste that marzipan cookies were covered  in. A commenter on Facebook reminded me that this word  could also refer  to the [meringue topping](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/)  that actual baked marzipans were covered with in the sixteenth century.  I am not fully convinced \u2013 it does not really mesh with the way the  word *mandel* is used as an uncountable here \u2013 but it sounds reasonable enough to consider. So I did both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kd970f04vuca1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=757f284687f485a48914483222fbf4bee9aa47ee\n\nStarting out with  plain white  bread (and again, it would be ideal to  have something like artisanal Br\u00f6tchen with a denser crumb than we  typically get induistrially), I soaked them in beaten egg and toasted  them in the oven until they were dry, but barely browned. Then I  preparted an almond paste with ground blanched almonds, egg, and sugar  that I spread on the bread and again toasted lightly. Then I spread half  the slices with a mix of beaten egg  white, sugar, and rosewater. It  happened under time pressure and ended up not looking pretty, but this  was not a beauty pageant. One all of it was toasted enough to be crusty,  I sliced up the bread into bite-sized pieces for ease of serving and  let it all cool down. I am convinced the original dish would have  involved larger pieces arranged decoratively.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntp7y9y4vuca1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17cf8ca16f0ac00cefda6f22267e9896ec089f73\n\nShortly before dessert time, I whipped cream with sugar and spread it  over the  bread pieces in the serving dish. One half was filled with  the bread pieces with only almond paste, the other with those topped  with egg whites. The latter were nicer to look at, and the combination  of two things beaten to a froth alone might have made this a favourite  at a time it was all a novelty. I had intended to try the dish  immediately, then let part of it stand for an hour or two to see how the   cream slowly reverting to liquid would affect the consistency. This  was not to be \u2013 the taste test was unequivocal and it was all gone.\n\nDoing this again, I intend to use Br\u00f6tchen with the crust on and   slice them horizontally before the first toasting and crosswise  afterwards to produce fingerfood-sized wedges. The taste result  convinces me of the almond paste, but I think it would even work with  only the meringue topping. And served as  a spoonable mess, it is  suitable for modern parties. I am still convinced it would be better  with fruit, but of course cream was mainly a springtime specialty and  fresh fruit seasonal in late summer, when whipping cream would be a  challenge.

Let them have a good heat so that they brown.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe and the instructions for making what  looks like proper choux pastry are quite detailed. However, the name has  left me a little stumped. Liechtfesser looks like a plural of [Lichtfass](https://fwb-online.de/lemma/liecht.s.2n),  a word that could refer to a lamp. The problem I have is that I cannot  quite see how the final result would resemble one. It might be meant to  look like a tallow dish with a spout to hold a wick. Similar ceramic  lights are still used in Hindu ceremonies. But rather than speculate, it  is probably best to actually try the recipe and see how it ends up  behaving in the pan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sixteenth-century ceramic oil lamp with a foot and handle](https://preview.redd.it/u8zoeda53aaa1.jpg?width=4139&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0d6dd48285f81e057209a27854cfaf457ee725f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ceramic oil lamp in use, India](https://preview.redd.it/yfti8ezd3aaa1.jpg?width=3088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64b6571b919c9750885c05c25594dfdc5bc31a6a)\n\nChoux pastry, known today as Brandteig or Br\u00fchteig in German, is by now something we can confidently date [to at least](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/08/a-possible-choux-pastry-recipe/) [the sixteenth century](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/29/piped-fritters/).  This sounds like it is exactly that: flour dissolved in boiling milk  and butter to produce a dry mass, then enriched with egg and cooked \u2013 in  this case fried.

Basically it seems to me that aside from things remaining  unspoken \u2013 how exactly do you make that dough? \u2013 it is a fairly clear  recipe. Gingerbread is grated and turned into a filling, wrapped in  another kind of dough that is then bent into shape and decorated with a  pattern pressed into the surface with a pastry wheel.  [Gingerbread ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/gingerbread-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-2/)is,  of course, exactly right for carnival \u2013 it is rich and luxurious,  available even in deepest winter, and does not need any fresh  ingredients to be enjoyed.

But it is not common (nit gewonlich).***\n\n***29 Galantine for Roast Goose (brauten g\u00e4n\u00df galray)***\n\n***Take a young goose when it is well prepared and roast it  very nicely. Take garlic and the same quantity of white bread and pound  that in a mortar, and pour in wine and vinegar and pass it through a  cloth. Then pour in honey and boil it up, and spice it well, then you  have a good galantine (galray) with the goose.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sauce of garlic and honey in a pitcher](https://preview.redd.it/nfa1o2emg41a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5073113f9917643c4f9e1e5d77b00d7620a71de1)\n\nThere are two recipes for what is basically the same sauce, and it  looks to be quite potent. The Process I opted for was to take two bulbs  of garlic and two slices of white bread that were roughly the same  volume (the same quantity by weight would have meant more bread). After  soaking the bread in white wine vinegar, I processed both together with  about half a cup of vinegar added, then brought it to a boil with about  half a cup of honey. The resulting liquid was thick and opaque, but  easily spoonable, and I decided not to dilute it any more. The sharpness  of garlic and the sweetness of honey worked surprisingly well together,  and the sauce definitely helped clear my sinuses. However, while I  liked it, the seasoned goose we had did not really need any sauce.\n\nNext, we made those [mystery cheese fritters from the same source](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/30/fritters-maybe-in-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/) (yes, they were supposed to function as a side dish):\n\n***65 Fritters (bachen) in a sauce (or bowl?*** **Jussel**\\*\\*\\*)\\*\\*\\*\n\n***For fritters in a*** **Jussel** ***(sauce), take grated  cheese and flour, break eggs into it, and season it well. Knead it  together and roll it out on a board and make long, thin strips of it and  fry them in fat. After that, cut them into a sauce (or bowl?*** **Jussel**\\*\\*\\*).\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cheese fritters served in a bowl](https://preview.redd.it/ckuf9m0og41a1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd00fad0dfd5ec343ed2194b1baaa3059f4c596)\n\nI opted for a relatively mild Gouda to combine with eggs, flour,  salt, pepper and nutmeg and managed to produce a moderately sticky dough  from that. The recipe does not specify the method of shaping the  fritters, but [a comparable recipe suggests](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/02/another-cheese-fritter-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)  rolling out and cutting into strips, so that is what I did here. Fried  in goose fat, they turned into cheese straws. They could have been  served in a sauce, and we have[ recipes for milk and egg being used](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/14/boiling-fritters-in-cgm-384-ii/) in it, but since there were already two sauces, we simply served them in a bowl.\n\nThen, we had mashed peas with a honey-mustard sauce. [This recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/12/rainworms-made-of-peas/) is from the [Inntalkochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Inntalkochbuch.pdf), but it has parallels elsewhere:\n\n***<<51>>*** **Regen w\u00fcrm von arbaiss**\n\n***Earthworms from peas***\n\n***Item: boiled in lye, remove their skins and boil them  until they are done. Pass them through a sieve into a bowl (to look)  like earthworms. Then take made mustard and honey and season it with  saffron and spices, and pour that over the peas.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mashed peas in a pot, prior to serving with honey-mustard sauce](https://preview.redd.it/lzzxcgn7h41a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=175f6bb5f63f1a3308ffa2b32247688ff322f1a7)\n\nTo save time, I bought pre-shelled yellow peas and simmered them for  90 minutes, then mashed them. I added a little salt, which was welcome,  and then mixed a moderate mustard with honey and a bit of cinnamon to  make the sauce. It was a winning combination, and I was surprised that  we actually finished an entire pot \u2013 500g of peas before soaking and  cooking \u2013 between us.\n\nAnd then there was compost. There are many varieties of this vegetable pickle, and I went with [one from Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/12/compost-recipes-from-cgm-384-i/):\n\n***8 Sweet Compost***\n\n***Sweet compost: wash young chard and scrape the roots, and  boil it in salted water. Then place it on a board until it is drained.  Take honey and wine in equal amounts and boil it in that, and (add) figs  and both types or kinds (baidertail oder lay) raisins. Colour  it and pour it on the chard, and strew anise and almonds on it. You may  also add medlars and pears if you like.***\n\n[Chard compost with raisins](https://preview.redd.it/dxsd2mhrg41a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e78082f19a4a4623ed5575a448de76e37ef0151)\n\nThis recipe is not very clear, but going by analogies and the nature  of compost as a preserved pickly, I interpreted is as something that  goes in a jar. I bought two bunches of chard and one small beet (chard  is sold without the roots today as we cultivate different versions of *beta* for  either, but in the Middle Ages, you ate both the leaves and the root). I  boiled both and chopped them up, drained off as much liquid as I could  and mixed them with dried figs and raisins. then I boiled a mixture of  wine and honey, added a little saffron, and poured it on. The compost  aged in my refrigerator for a week, but I kept a jar to see how it does  by January or so. The immediate result was not bad, but also not as  convincing as the rest. Sweet chard is not that appealing to me, or  anyone else at the table.\n\nAltogether, it was a very successful meal. We almost forgot that we  had a dessert, but he was spotted, fetched, and duly devoured.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A marzipan hedehog with almond bristles and raisin eyes](https://preview.redd.it/jf443o8tg41a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e6946e27e06c135704804d8ff54c91edd60c4e9)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/z06iah/side_dishes_for_15th_century_roast_goose/", "created_utc": 1668957127.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/z06iah/side_dishes_for_15th_century_roast_goose/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

At the core of it was a goose, and excellent (and  not oversized) bird my friend was able to procure. We tried the method  detailed in [this recipe from Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/06/seasoning-a-goose-under-the-skin/):\n\n***30 Filled Geese***\n\n***Again take a goose as before, or one that is older, and prepare it. Grasp it (begriff die)  between skin and flesh as you do a chicken and take garlic and bacon  and pepper, pound that, fill it with this, and roast it very well.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujcz8v39631a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8417fd81876c9d3960061201325b137bf48debbc\n\nThe idea was intriguing, and it turns out separating the skin of a  goose from its flesh is not very difficult. It can be done with the hand  \u2013 *begriff* is a good descriptor. I had to separate skin and  flesh with a knife around the initial opening, the rest worked easily  wriggling the fingers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhtlj4yb631a1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e24311d0221a6a009d43b1f121a71eb9ba915d98\n\nThe seasoning consisted of about half a pound of bacon, two bulbs of  garlic, and a good tablespoon of ground pepper. All of it was chopped  together, inserted between the skin and the flesh, and pressed on firmly  from the outside. Next time, I will consider reducing it to a paste  because individual pieces of bacon shrank and hardened during cooking,  causing the skin and the meat to separate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jlip2qe631a1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e580860da546bd5fb6e95ae2fe1d7ffb38264d24\n\nStill, the result was excellent. I cooked the goose in a closed roasting pan, the traditional *G\u00e4nsebr\u00e4ter*,  starting at 150\u00b0C. The temperature was raised to 175\u00b0C after the first  90 minutes and to 200\u00b0C for the final 30 minutes with the lid open. The  skin came out crisp and spicy, the meat juicy, tender and aromatic, and  the process also yielded a lot of goose fat suffused with garlic that  will perform admirably on *Schmalzbrot*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2sdyn2lg631a1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dceb760932aea832a9918a256095458495599490\n\nBoth because I was unsure whether our side dishes would work out and  because we had leftover apples and bread, I also prepared a stuffing for  the goose. Garlic, pepper, ginger and nutmeg comined well with this,  though I have to say the next time I should sonsider one of the  documented alternatives. The filling came out delicious, and since both  side dishes also succeeded, we basically rolled away from the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/z01559/a_fifteenthcentury_goose_roast/", "created_utc": 1668941363.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/z01559/a_fifteenthcentury_goose_roast/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I\u2019m curious: garlic was part of the original, 15th century recipe?"]}

{"title": "Singapore Cuisine - About \"Lor Mee\", It's Origins and Styles", "selftext": "Perhaps not exactly history, but a \"what I found out\" post. This seems like a relevant subreddit for contents like this, along with r/AskFoodHistorians.\n\nThe below is a compilation of sources that I used to trace back the origins of Lor Mee from Singapore, which I have also posted on my personal [blog](https://justafatboi.com/lor-mee-origins/). The reason why I felt compelled to compile them is firstly due to personal interest, but secondly because information on Lor Mee is very scattered on the internet and most of them are not translated into English. Whether they are accurate I cannot know, but they are what I have learnt while reading up on Lor Mee.\n\n# What the hell is Lor Mee/Lu Mian\n\n# [Lor Mee from Bukit Purmei](https://i.imgur.com/uUVNjWx.jpg), Photo by MissTamChiak\n\n[Lor Mee made by GuaiShuShu](https://i.imgur.com/VXewWlq.jpg), a blogger in Singapore\n\nLor Mee consists of 2 words which describes the main portions of the dish. \"Lor\" or \u9e75, refers to the thick starchy gravy. \"Mee\" or \u9eb5, refers to the noodles portion of the meal. Ingredients then top the noodles (like seen above), with ingredients depending on the stall, but commonly seen items are Ngo Hiang, fish cakes, fish, dumplings or eggs in various combinations. This dish is commonly found in Hawker Centers all over Singapore. At the front of the stall where you take your utensils, there will usually be Black Vinegar, Soy Sauce, grated or minced Garlic, Sambal Chilli, Spring onions, sliced Red Chillis that you can add to taste.\n\n[Example ](https://i.imgur.com/MHvliaP.jpg)of Lor Mee stall in Hawker Center\n\nThe dish itself is quite heavy - modern versions often have fried items and the gravy is usually savoury and often sour. As such, Lor Mee is not something you eat frequently.\n\nTake note, the above description only applies to the most common version you can find in Singapore, because Lor Mee/Lu Mian is different not only in China and Malaysia, but also from stall to stall! Perhaps the only similarity is the 2 major components of thick gravy and noodles.\n\nIf you want to know how the \"Singapore\" version is made:\n\n* [GuaiShushu's](https://kwgls.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/chinese-braised-noodles-lor-mee-%E5%8D%A4%E9%9D%A2/) recipe (written blog post)\n* [TheMEATMen's ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g9kMXezoRQ)recipe (video with word description)\n* [SpiceN'Pans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTQPHOqjK0)' recipe (video with verbal explanation)\n\nThe general steps for making Singapore's version of Lor Mee starts with braising meat in a flavourful broth, which will then be used to make the gravy by adding other ingredients (meat, seafood, and/or vegetables depending on style) and a thickener. Noodles and toppings are then cooked separately and served with the gravy mixed in.\n\n# Lor Mee Origins\n\nThe history and origins of Singapore hawker food dishes is not easy to trace. Many dishes are adaptations of dishes from various regions (like [Hainanese Chicken Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainanese_chicken_rice), which is an adaptation of [Wenchang chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_chicken) from Hainan in China). And then there are dishes like the Singaporean version of Lor Mee which have been adapted and changed so much that it is almost an entirely new dish.\n\nSingapore's version of Lor Mee can be traced back to [Fujian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian), as it is one of the dishes that Fujian emigrants have brought over to Singapore when they were forced to emigrate by the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War). Given this information, it is thus intuitive to look at the Lor Mee in Fujian and compare to Singapore's.The Fujian province in China has many cities, and in each of the cities where Lor Mee can be found there are major differences in the dish. As far as I can tell from reading [Baidu ](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8D%A4%E9%9D%A2/2952561)as well as other random articles, there are 3 major styles of Lor Mee that are somewhat similar to Singapore's in China; ZhangZhou, Putian and QuanZhou.\n\nLets start with the version that is the most dissimilar to Singapore's Lor Mee.\n\n## [Putian Lor Mee](https://i.imgur.com/ncrCIrn.jpg)\n\nJust from the picture alone, it already seems like a completely different dish. The Putian or [HengHua ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putian_people)Lor Mee is more seafood and vegetable based, with ingredients like scallops, clams, prawns, nappa cabbage. Noodles are also thinner and rounder.\n\nPreparation wise, the methods are similar in that a broth is made and then noodles are topped, but the ingredients used are so much different that I believe this is not related to the thick, dark and gooey Singapore's version of Lor Mee.\n\nYou can still find this style of Lor Mee in Singapore, but it is a lot more uncommon and will often be labeled as [Putian Lor Mee](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%8E%86%E7%94%B0%E5%8D%A4%E9%9D%A2) rather than just Lor Mee. Probably not the roots I am looking for!\n\n## [QuanZhou Lor Mee](https://i.imgur.com/6w7bP6z.jpg)\n\nUnlike the Singapore's version, [QuanZhou Lor Mee](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B3%89%E5%B7%9E%E5%8D%A4%E9%9D%A2)'s gravy is not made by braising beforehand. Instead, it is made to order and ingredients like shrimp and clam, a pork based broth, and even noodles, are cooked in a wok together. A noteable ingredient is that traditionally, [Shacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shacha_sauce) sauce, a peanut and chilli sauce related to [Satay sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_sauce), is added to their version of Lor Mee, giving a nuttier flavour. The addition of Shacha sauce do make me wonder if this version can be considered a cousin of [Shacha Noodle](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B2%99%E8%8C%B6%E9%9D%A2).\n\nIn case you're wondering what is the 8 logo on the top right of the picture, that is a TV Channel Logo. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hOyLEXHWGA&feature=youtu.be&t=14m), which is a Singaporean TV show on hawker food origins, showed a chef in Quanzhou making their version of Lor Mee. In the cooking process, emphasis was also placed on the the choice of noodles. The change in cooking methods meant that Sheng Mian ([\u751f\u9762](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%94%9F%E9%9D%A2)) is used over Huang Mian ([\u9ec4\u9762](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%BB%84%E9%9D%A2)), which is the usual choice in Singapore's Lor Mee.\n\nIn the show, Singapore's and Zhangzhou's Lor Mee was also shown.\n\n## ZhangZhou Lor Mee\n\n[ZhangZhou Lor Mee](https://i.imgur.com/EJGpW09.png) from Ah Fen Lu Mian\n\n[Another Example](https://i.imgur.com/uLOlGJE.jpg)\n\n[Zhangzhou's Lor Mee](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%BC%B3%E5%B7%9E%E5%8D%A4%E9%9D%A2) is perhaps the closest to Singapore's. In Ah Fen Lu Mian, a Lor Mee brand in ZhangZhou, a pre-braised pot of gravy can be clearly seen together with other ingredients. Here, you can basically add anything you like on top of your Lor Mee, including ingredients like Ngoh Hiang, eggs and braised pork which you can find in the Singapore's version!\n\n[Ah Fen Lu Mian](https://i.imgur.com/ZEaZu8I.jpg)\n\nThe preparation methods are also very similar; the broth is prepared first using ingredients like pork, squid, scallops, mushrooms. On order, noodles are then cooked and then the gravy and other cooked ingredients are added as toppings. The darker colour is achieved from adding braising liquid from braised meat, and the pale yellow strands in the gravy are eggs. At this point, it seems safe to say that the similarities meant that Singapore's version is at the very least heavily influenced by Zhangzhou's Lor Mee.\n\nAnother small trivia: In Zhangzhou, Lor Mee is pretty much eaten all the time and even during festive dates like Weddings and Duanwu Festival. Lor Mee is a very huge part of their culture.\n\n## Other Styles Worth Mentioning\n\n## Fuzhou Lor Mee\n\nThere is also Fuzhou's Lor Mee, which is very similar to Zhangzhou's. But I have not yet found a source that clearly shows what is the difference between Fuzhou's and Zhangzhou's Lor Mee.\n\n## Malaysia, [Ulu Yam Lor Mee](https://i.imgur.com/yuHtkSW.jpg)\n\nAs Malaysia is Singapore's neighbour, it would not be surprising if we can find clues about Singapore's Lor Mee from analysing Malaysia's version.\n\nIn terms of preparation, the Ulu Yam Lor Mee is closer to the Quanzhou's Lor Mee. The ingredients, including the broth, meat and noodles are cooked in the wok like in a one pot pasta dish.\n\nHere you would think that from preparation methods alone, you can conclude that the Malaysian version is a derivative of Quanzhou's Lor Mee, but that does not seem to be true.\n\nThe Malaysian version is said to be [originated from Hock Choon Kee](https://archive.is/20140812040207/http://www.tourmalaysia.com/2010/09/25/penang-food-loh-mee-%E5%8D%A4%E9%9D%A2/) in Ulu Yam, Selangor, which eventually spread to all over Malaysia. From an [interview with Hock Choon Kee](https://youtu.be/BNWz-rknkTI?t=2m30s), it seems that the founder went to Singapore and ate Mian Hu, which he then came back to Malaysia to try to recreate. Despite looking similar in terms of gravy and noodles, Malaysia's Lor Mee is probably quite different from Singapore's. You can say it is almost an original dish.\n\n## Malaysia, [Sitiawan's Lor Mee](https://i.imgur.com/YYAsGMH.jpg)\n\nIn Malaysia, Sitiawan, Fuzhou Lor Mee is sold as a dish. The Lor Mee itself isn't too different from the Zhangzhou style written above, but the locals here do have a unique way of eating Lor Mee; by adding [Laksa ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laksa)gravy into the dark, gooey gravy. This is also called [\u5364\u8fa3\u9762](https://my.openrice.com/zh/perak/article/%E3%80%90sitiawan%E7%8B%AC%E7%89%B9%E7%A6%8F%E5%B7%9E%E7%BE%8E%E9%A3%9F%E3%80%91%E5%AE%9E%E5%85%86%E8%BF%9C%E8%B6%85%E8%BF%8710%E7%A7%8D%E5%BF%85%E5%B0%9D%E7%BE%8E%E9%A3%9F-a1859) (Lu La Mian). This would be like a sub-set of Fuzhou Lor Mee, but not exactly a regional style by itself. Typically, Assam laksa (tamarind or gelugur based) is used.\n\n## Philippine's [Lomi](https://i.imgur.com/xCAxovQ.jpg)\n\nThis Filipino-Chinese dish is also quite similar in both looks, preparation and name to Lor Mee. There are various variations within the Philippines, including [Pancit Lomi](https://casaveneracion.com/pancit-lomi/) and [Batangas Lomi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fztxBM6ZAqw). The preparation seems to be largely similar, starting with a braising broth which is then used to create a gravy. Key difference seems to be the addition of more local ingredients, like Calamansi and pork liver.\n\n# The Complication\n\nSo I guess we're ready to pack it up and say that Singapore's Lor Mee is basically a modified version of Zhangzhou's Lor Mee right? That would normally be the case, but if you ask hawkers the answers seem to be a bit different. In a [Lor Mee review](http://ieatishootipost.sg/feng-zhen-lor-mee-hearty-hearty-lor-mee/) post by Singaporean blogger, ieatishootipost, he typed \"Most of the hawkers agree that this is a dish that was brought over by our Hokkien forefathers from Xiamen. I have found some evidence (1) that in Xiamen, they have a version of Lor Mee that is eaten together with Ngor Hiang (Chinese pork rolls).\"\n\nHold on, Xiamen?? That isn't a place we encountered when looking at the versions of Lor Mee available.\n\nThe cities where Lor Mee can be found as a significant dish are in in the Southern region of Fujian; Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Putian and Fuzhou (from what I gather by reading the [Chinese Wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%BB%B7%E9%BA%B5) on Lor Mee). Hey look, they are all next to each other on the [Fujian](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Fujian) [map](https://i.imgur.com/eIAp7rl.png), with the exception of Xiamen being sandwiched in between.\n\nWith the geographical proximity of Xiamen, it is usually expected that Lor Mee can be found in some form. Yet, online searches yield little mentions of Lor Mee as a significant dish in Xiamen, or at least significant enough to have its own style. However, there are dishes similar to Lor Mee that are sold in Xiamen now. The first one is Shacha mian ([\u6c99\u8336\u9762](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B2%99%E8%8C%B6%E9%9D%A2)), which uses a Shacha sauce, peanut based sauce that was brought over from South East Asia because of trade. If you thought Shacha sounded familiar, it is because as I mentioned earlier, Shacha sauce is also used traditionally in Quanzhou's Lor Mee. In my opinion, Shacha Mian is probably more similar to [Satay Bee Hoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satay_bee_hoon) than Lor Mee.\n\nThe second one would be [Mian Xian Hu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%9D%A2%E7%BA%BF%E7%B3%8A), which is probably the Mian Hu mentioned before that influenced Malaysia's Lor Mee. [This](https://i.imgur.com/tUUa1ZP.jpg) is a version that looks similar to Putian's Lor Mee, but [other ](https://i.imgur.com/btljDoM.jpg)versions look more watery and have a much thinner noodle.\n\n# The Conclusion\n\nAlthough hawkers are terrific at creating their dishes, when it comes to the history of the dishes they create, the information they give may be subject to a lot of human error. Additionally, as hawkers are not historians nor food researchers, they might not pay as much close attention to the origins of the dish, but only the origins of their version of the dish.\n\nMy reasoning is that Xiamen, as a port city, is where the Fujian conducted trade, and thus where culinary ideas or ingredients were exchanged. The dishes that were brought to Singapore may not necessarily be a Xiamen dish. Even if the dishes were brought over directly from Xiamen, it is possible that Lor Mee was brought over from other regions first before going to Xiamen, then to Singapore.\n\nIt is also an amazing fact to learn that Malaysia's Ulu Yam Lor Mee is not brought in directly from China, but is a reinterpretation of another dish that the Fujian peoeple brought to Singapore. Just based on looks alone, it looks extremely similar, and it fits the literal meaning of Lor Mee, \"Lor (gravy)\" and the \"Mee (noodle)\". Yet, if you look at it's roots, you can argue to say that it is not actually a \"Lor Mee\", but more of a derivative of \"Mian Xian Hu\".\n\nStrictly looking at modern methods of preparing Lor Mee, I believe that Singapore's Lor Mee is most closely related to Zhangzhou's. However, the Lor Mee that we find in Singapore today is a culmination of the changes in taste, ingredients available, and individual hawker preferences or cultural influences.\n\n## Other Notes\n\n1.

The restaurants prepared a mostly European menu, and only a few served high-end Chinese food, which \u201ccatered exclusively to white patrons.\u201d\n\n- The sale of food items\u2014whether it was by way of restaurant, grocery store, or street vending\u2014provided immigrants a means to climb their way up the economic ladder. This contributed to the food landscape in America becoming more cosmopolitan in nature, as urban populations became increasingly foreign-born.\n\n- German, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican ethnic grocery stores \u201cwere important social institutions in immigrant neighborhoods throughout the United States.\u201d The shops sold foods imported from the \u2018old country,\u2019 such as sharks\u2019 fins from China and olive oil and pasta from Italy, and became informal gathering spaces for locals. Ethnic groceries also offered news from home and served as informal post offices, banks, and job offices. The stores gave ethnic groups a way to connect with one another and with their countries of origin.\n\n- In the 19th century, native-born Americans did not eat at ethnic restaurants. Restaurateurs were intolerant in many ways, and very few cosmopolitan diners went to Little Italy or Chinatown as they considered it a \u201cforay into the exotic.\u201d\n\n- The United States offered an abundant food landscape to late-19th-century immigrants in comparison with that available in their homelands. Foods that were previously accessible only to wealthy landowners in Italy, like pasta and olive oil, became staples of the Italian American pantry. Meanwhile, meat\u2014a treat that Italian peasants might enjoy on an annual basis\u2014was eaten weekly or even daily in the United States. Abundant family meals, once relegated to feast days, became weekly Sunday dinners in the homes of urban Italians and Italian Americans.\n\n- Sandwiches and spaghetti (Italian); egg creams (Jewish); nachos and chili (Tex-Mex); and hamburger, sausages, pickles, and the lager beer (German) were all introduced into the American diet by urban immigrants in the 19th century.\n\n- German immigrants are credited with inventing the American beer industry in the 1800s.\n\nSource: http://blog.oup.com/2016/10/immigrants-food-america/\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/5qwy5v/the_transformation_of_food_in_america_in_the_19th/", "created_utc": 1485732096.0, "score": 9, "author": "redsoxgirl9876", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/5qwy5v/the_transformation_of_food_in_america_in_the_19th/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Read 97 Orchard Street!

Soften them in water for one night, wash them, and cook them until they are almost done. Cool it and take off the scales with a knife. Cut them (the fish) into thin slices. Serve a good pheffer sauce with it, or if you want to have them cold, a sweet mustard. Prepare it with spices, pour it over the fish and serve it.

The instruction to water the fish for a night makes it clear that it is either dried or salted. This makes sense \u2013 a high-status food would have been profitable to trade over long distances.\n\nThe preparation is not very inspiring. The sturgeon (or salmon) is treated [much like stockfish is in the same source ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/08/stockfish-recipes/)(recipe #129). It is rehydrated, boiled, sliced, and served with a sauce.

Both sauces are recorded in our sources frequently, as it were the default options of the late medieval cook. Still, this may be a simple dish, but it required some skill and a fair amount of wealth.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Chitterlings in Vinegar Herb Sauce (15th c.)", "selftext": "Not all recipes in the medieval tradition are appealing to modern tastes at first glance, but this one may not be at all bad:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkl95ggve5ke1.jpg?width=696&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97535b913767db7499237aeecbfb1ed633fe7da4\n\n***133 A gmues of chitterlings (kaldaunen)***\n\n***Take the stomach and gut of a pig and cut it into squares (w\u00fcrfellat). Then take parsley, sage, mint, pennyroyal, eggs, bread, caraway (or cumin? chummel) in greater quantity than pepper. Grind this with vinegar and good broth. Pour that on the chitterlings (kaldaum) and add fat. Let it boil up so it becomes thick. If you do not have fresh herbs (gr\u00fcn ding), take other seasonings. This way you can cook with chitterlings (kaldaun).***\n\nThis recipe reminds us that when we talk of meat consumption in medieval Germany, we mean all parts of the animal. There is a clear hierarchy to them, and while we have many instructions for the prized pieces \u2013 roasting-grade muscle meat, brains, and liver \u2013 there are fewer for the less desirable bits. This is a valuable survival. The stomachs and guts of slaughtered animals \u2013 were a saleable commodity, and here we can get an idea what was done with them. The recipe is also notable for not ennobling its subject matter with high-value additions. This is not poverty cuisine, but it could easily be envisioned on the table of an artisan or substantial farmer.\n\nInterpreting the dish depends on how we read the proportion of ingredients, and whether the eggs added to it are raw or cooked. We have sauces that specify boiled eggs, so this is not as odd as it sounds. I read it as mainly a bread-thickened, vinegary sauce of fresh herbs which could be quite attractive. All herbs are ground to a paste with eggs and grated bread, then added to a quantity of broth and vinegar and boiled until it thickens into a homogenous liquid. Pepper and caraway (or cumin \u2013 the word is still ambiguous at this point) give it a spicy bite at an affordable rate. In urban environments, this would be available regularly as butchers working year-round sold the innards by weight. In rural areas and larger, self-sufficient households, it would berarer and possibly associated with the celebration of a slaughter, a *Schlachtfest*, when meat was preserved for the year and the pieces liable to spoil fast shared out among friends and neighbours.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Their distinctive large caps, traditionally served stuffed with a [scrambled egg mixture](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/11/stuffed-morels-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/), were [imitated using](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/19/faux-morels-for-christmas-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) [egg batter](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/06/faux-morels-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/) or [meat ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/08/faux-morels-from-liver/)[paste](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/09/differently-fake-morels/). It is also possible that this recipe, however poorly, describes a similar process. However, morels were [also simply fried](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/04/batter-fried-morels-from-cgm-384-ii/), and those would work well on or in a kind of omelet.\n\nAs to how it combines with the *topanitz* \u2013 I don\u2019t know. If we read the latter as dish of toasted bread, it could be topped with a mushroom omelet. If it is more porridgelike, it could be used as a base or a side dish. Without at least another parallel, or ideally a better description, we are left guessing. However, I can imagine fried mushrooms in a fluffy omelet on a fragrant slice of toasted white bread and topped with a garlicky herb sauce as quite delicious.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Bpiled Cabbage with Meat, Eggs and Cheese (15th c.)", "selftext": "Another recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS that we don\u2019t see very much of: Cooking cabbage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/djzt8b9acege1.jpg?width=381&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91c1cb1acec0c1d85b18e36befec7bd6a0016408\n\n***92 Of young white cabbage (kraut)***\n\n***Take young white cabbage and cut it into wedges. Lay it in the pot and let it boil, then pour off the water. Have ready boiled meat in a different pot, mutton or beef, and lay the meat in with the cabbage. Then take eggs and boil them hard. Peel them and fry them in a pan whole. When the meat and the cabbage are nearly boiled, put in the eggs and hard cheese and let it boil together again. Make it quite fat. But if you do not want to cook it with meat, put on eggs prepared in the pan as described before and the cheese, and serve it.***\n\nWe do not get a lot of recipes for things like boiled cabbage compared to almond milk jelly or complicated fish preparations, but these dishes were more common even on the tables of the wealthy. This way of preparing it surely is not poverty food. Noter that the first cooking water is poured off \u2013 commonly prescribed for cabbage for health reasons and to get rid of the smell. The cooked cabbage is then served with boiled meat. Mutton or beef were less desirable types of meat, especially the quality that was suitable for boiling rather than roasting, but meat in quantity was still a sign of wealth.\n\nThe eggs are an interesting touch. Actually frying whole hard-boiled eggs would not have occurred to me, but surely it works. I am not sure how to read the addition of cheese. It is possible to simply cook chunks of cheese with the cabbage, but depending on how dry the dish is, it may be meant to melt and coat the other ingredients. I could imagine this in a pan with a relatively small amount of rich broth, meat chunks and hard-boiled eggs on a bed of cabbage, with cheese melting on top, and I think I want to try it before winter ends.\n\nAs an aside, the reference to making this dish without meat will not make it suitable for fast days since it still contains eggs and dairy. Given it comes from a monastic context, it may be intended for diners who are forbidden the meat of quadrupeds even on regular days.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

There are [many surviving recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/01/all-the-almond-cheeses/). The Dorotheenkloster proposes a kind of jelly. It is a nearly identical parallel of a recipe in the Innsbruck MS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4yqupgwnfbe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a12d71347b3fa349825a50acd7f92b0336381170\n\n***33 Again a different dish***\n\n***If you want to have an almond cheese, you must have isinglass and you must have 2 pounds (*****talenta*****) of almonds for one dish. This is how you make the almond cheese: Grind (the almonds) nicely and pass them through a white cloth. And (take) one*** **lot** ***of isinglass and boil it in water. And you must pass the isinglass through (a cloth) together with the almonds with the boiled water. The milk should not boil. Sweeten it with sugar, one quarter pound (*****firdung*****) and add it to the cheese. Take a glazed bowl and pour the milk into it, then it will become firm. Let it stand for a while so it turns into a cheese. Add sweet almond milk to it. And you can cut (the cheese) into four parts so the milk passes inbetween. Stick it with almonds and serve it.***\n\nThere are a few differences, but basically this is the same recipe as in the Innsbruck MS. The proportion of almonds to sugar is slightly higher \u2013 2 talenta versus 1 1/2 pounds \u2013 but otherwise it is identical in all important points. Almond milk is made from a significant quantity of almonds \u2013 even assuming a low weight for the ever variable pound, we are not getting below 600-700 grammes. This is then mixed with gelatin cooked from maybe 12-15 grammes of isinglass and sweetened with about 120 grammes of sugar. The resulting jelly will be familiar to all modern diners, though to our tastes it would probably seem bland. Cutting it into quarters and serving it in a platter of (almond) milk completes the illusion of eating green cheese, and the decorative almonds stuck in add to its visual appeal.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Then take the fish and remove its bones, and leave the skin alone. Chop the fish and mix it with other fish when you fill it again. You must season it with spices, that way it becomes good and well-tasting. You must (also) have hyssop, pellitory, and southernwood, and in addition sage and parsley. Chop that into the fish and fill it into the skin again. This is called a May pike (mayen hecht). If it is not a fast day, break eggs into it, but if it is a fast day, chop an apple into it. Attach the head again and close it up with string, that way the pike becomes whole. Also fill the \u2018ear cheeks\u2019 (\u00f6rwenglein, the gills) with the same filling (as the skin).

If you do this right, the broth will be black.***\n\nSmall birds, without much regard for species, were a popular food in medieval and Renaissance Germany. They were not covered by hunting restrictions and could usually be bought in urban markets from hunters who caught them in nets, snares, or glue traps. Here are two ways they were cooked.\n\nThe two recipes are somewhat unclear and look quite similar at first glance. It is likely the first is garbled: The birds emerge boiled from washing. Either the wrong verb was used, or the text omits a parboiling step. They are then fried, the fat drained, and broth and spices added to boil them. The second open question is whether the raisins (weinber) mentioned here are not a misspelling for wine (wein). It would be more in keeping with contemporary practice, but both are possible. Raisins are certainly added to meat cooking sauces.\n\nThe second recipe is clearer: The birds are scalded and cooked in a mixture of wine, broth, and fat. I cannot see how the broth would turn black, though, unless the instructions omit an important step. Perhaps blood was added.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gmrpm7/cooking_small_birds_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1731096376.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gmrpm7/cooking_small_birds_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

When it is washed and picked, it is put into a vessel, or you may put it on a board as well, and then set by the fire so it becomes quite dry. When it is dry, it is put into a mortar and pounded well, and then sifted through a sieve or cloth so it becomes like flour.***\n\n***Second, the breast of a chicken or capon is cut out. It is set in a cauldron ore pot and let boil until it is boiled fully, but not too much. Then the breast is taken out and allowed to cool. Then it is beaten (read klopfen for topfen) small (so it becomes soft) like silk. Then it is wrapped in a napkin so it does not become pointy (spissig) or hard.***\n\n***Third, the flour of rice is taken, a handful, and put into a clean, tinned vessel. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is a deep, wide pot (Peckhen) or a pan. Good cream is poured on, or the flour stirred into it beforehand, so it becomes thin. Then the same is set over glowing coals in the tinned vessel and stirred quite well so it does not burn or turn lumpy (knollet), It quickly turns nicely thick. Then, you must again pour in cream and stir it again and when it boils up, put in the plucked breast and pour in a little rosewater. When it turns nicely thick again, add nicely grated sugar so it turns properly sweet. You must also salt it lightly and add a piece of fresh butter the size of an egg. It is then taken off the fire and served.***\n\n***When you put the sugar into the dish (Mue\u00df), it must be quite thick beforehand because it becomes thin from that point onwards. It also must not boil after the sugar goes in, otherwise it will soon turn black.***\n\n***238 To make it with fish***\n\n***Take a pike and let it boil until it is done like you would otherwise do with a pike. Then take out the pike, pick out the bones, and chop it, and then do with it as is written of the chicken breast. Or take a piece of stockfish and boil it well and pick out the white (parts) and put those into the dish if it is made as it is described in the other (recipe).***\n\nTowards the end of Philippine Welser\u2019s collection, we encounter a series of recipes that are written in a different format and provide much more detail than the majority.

This is one such example, a fairly straighforward recipe for [medieval-style ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/11/blancmanger-by-yet-another-name/)[blancmanger](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/21/blancmanger-by-any-other-name/). It is fairly standard, except in insisting to use cream in place of almond milk, but the level of detail is very unusual. We are even reminded to wrap the pounded meat in a napkin and treated to observations about how the sauce base behaves during the cooking process. Quantities are not given systematically, but often enough to make this reconstructible with some confidence. It\u2019s still going to be quite dull, though, but with blancmanger, that is the goal.\n\nIncidentally, the spelling of the name suggests that wherever the cook who committed it to paper had learned their trade, it wasn\u2019t France.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gf4aw2/blancmanger_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1730232934.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gf4aw2/blancmanger_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I created a new subedit called sca\\_cooking, could you possible add this reddit to your posting of recipes?"]}
{"title": "Filled Crawfish Shells (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/22/filled-crawfish/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/22/filled-crawfish/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmp0ci75ycwd1.jpg?width=2622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dd19f003bf2f75096f98ae46f33e5081c5ca8e9\n\n  \nHere is another recipe from Philippine Welser\u2019s collection with deep antecedents:\n\n***209 To make filled crawfish***\n\n***Take crawfish and boil them until they are done. Then take the claws and the tails, shell them, and chop them. Add small raisins and spices. Mix it with an egg, and if you want it to be sweet, add sugar. Fill it (back) into the shells and fry them at a cool temperature or roast them on a griddle or a skewer.***\n\nSurviving recipe sources abound wioth recipes for crawfish. These freshwater crustaceans were much more plentiful then, but like all fresh fish, they were not cheap. These were modest luxuries, feast day fare, though if you were the Welser family, sums of this size would not even register.\n\nThe idea of mashing the meat and turning it into a stuffing that would be returned into the shells for cooking is entirely in keeping with medieval practice. They did it [with fish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/11/filled-fish-from-the-innsbruck-ms/), and we have at [least two surviving recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/23/filled-crawfish-shells-from-cgm-384-ii/) for [treating crawfish shells this way](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/10/filled-crawfish-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/). This one uses fashionable sugar, but otherwise it is really quite close to what was written down a century earlier in [Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf):\n\n***11 Filled Crawfish***\n\n***Take large crawfish and take their shells off whole. Take out the innards (das ynder) and discard what is evil, and chop the rest on a clean board. Add fried eggs (gebachen ayer) and chop it all together, and season it and colour it and fill the crawfish shells with that. Thrust the shells over one another, lay them on a griddle, and roast them well.***\n\nAnd in the first printed cookbook in German, the Kuchenmaistrey of 1485 ([translation available in print](https://ellipsisimprints.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach/)):\n\n***1.xi Item make filled crawfish thus. Boil them in water and shell them nicely. And lay the good, large claws and tails aside separately. Take the other small shelled crawfish necks, bellies and claws, chop them very small and break fresh eggs into them, as much as the quantity of the crawfish. Mix them with spices and salt and make them yellow a little. Chop parsley into them, but only the leaves and no stems. Knead it well in (coated with?) raw egg so that stays sticky and holds together. Then take the hofel or back shells and fill them well. Reverse another hofel over that so that one head says hither and the other says yonder, one belly against the other.***\n\n***If you would then roast them, stick two or three on a skewer. Lay them on a griddle, and do not make it too hot until the filling firms up and becomes properly done (gerecht werd). Thus serve them warm.***\n\n***If you would fry them in fat until the filling has gained enough, you may also do that until they are properly done. And serve those, too.***\n\nClearly a popular dish.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

This is the conclusion of the chapter on Mus:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76dcdxlnn0pd1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79b91cc10676aec81e0cc8c4ff05bce3af8cfa6a\n\n***169 If you want to make an apple Mus***\n\n***Take the apples, peel them, and add wine when you set them to cook. When you have steamed them enough, pass them through a colander and break 3 or 4 eggs into it. Add sugar, ginger, and saffron to it and put it into a pot. Let it boil well together again and stir it often.***\n\n***170 If you want to make an apple Mus***\n\n***Boil the apples well and pass them through a cloth. Grate semel bread crumbs into it and take 10 eggs to each mess (disch). Beat a little milk with the eggs and pour that into the mashed apples. Also add the grated semel breadcrumbs and saffron and sugar. Stir it well together. Put fat into a pot, let it get hot, and pour the apples into it. Set it over the coals and let it boil. Stir it so it becomes shaggy (krau\u00df).***\n\n***171 If you want to make an apple Mus in a bowl***\n\n***Take apples and cut them into thin slices. Put them into a bowl and add sugar and cinnamon. Pour (bren) hot fat over them, pour on a little wine, and set it on a griddle. Wrap a wet cloth around the rim (refft) and put coals underneath, and let it boil until it is enough. Serve it warm.***\n\n***172 If you want to make a pear Mus***\n\n***Take good pears and boil them in wine. Add salt and pass them through a cloth. Add sugar and spices, put it into a pot, and let it boil. Stir it often and serve it warm.***\n\nIt is the season for apples again, and time to think about what to do with them. Apples as well as [pears ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=pear)generally played a [very prominent role](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=apple) in the German culinary world, and Philippine Welser\u2019s collection records ways of [putting them into](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/11/pear-tarts/) [pies and tarts](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/06/as-augsburgian-as-apple-pie/) and making [fritters ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/07/24/fried-apple-slices/)and [pancakes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/02/how-to-flip-an-apple-pancake/). By comparison, these are very pedestrian approaches, but *Apfelmus* continues to have a [cherished place on many tables](https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/beloved-of-kings-and-kindergartners/).\n\nThere is very little about these recipes that is distinctive or exceptional. A *Mus* of steamed fruit bound with egg or with breadcrumbs is very much a standard dish that we find in many sources. The method of cooking the fruit in a sealed bowl is more interesting, but far from unique. But of course all of this is liable to produce tasty results. Apples and pears are delicious. Often, the simplest way of treating them can be the best.\n\nIf you aim to recreate them, it is important to note that though these recipes contain sugar, they are not necessarily sweet. We associate apples with dessert, but that was not the case then. In the fifteenth and sixteenth century, apples featured in sauces for meat, fillings for roasts and poultry, and fish and meat pastries. These *Mus* dishes can be sweet, but they can equally be savoury and spicy, with just a bit of sugar added for the sake of fashion.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Several are not clear in themselves. However, the Benedictiones clearly have a logicxal structure and I believe that the lines between the end of the section on honey (#1248) and the beginning of cakes (#159) form a cohesive whole. The theme appears to be condiments, in a very broad sense.\n\nThe problems begin with #49; it is not quite clear what a *moretum* is. Several earlier text describe it as a strongly seasoned, mashed dish. The most famous,[ a pseudo-Virgilian poem, has it made from cheese and garlic](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/28/a-roman-supper-before-trier/), but other sources describe *moretum* made with nut kernels. Of course, all our descriptions also date to much earlier than the Benedictiones. What a *moretum* is in the eleventh century is anyone\u2019s guess. I believe it is a sauce or relish of some kind. A misreading of *moratum* \u2013 mulberry wine \u2013 is unlikely.\n\nBased perhaps on the latter possibility, Dora translates the \u2018hot liquids\u2019 of #150 as \u2018beverages\u2019 (*Getr\u00e4nke*), but given the context it occurs in, I think this refers to sauces. A later change to the manuscript to \u2018hot and warm\u2019 (fervores calidosque) does not clarify matters. \u201cHot\u201d is almost certainly a reference to temperature, not spiciness, but sauces are served warm both in earlier and later culinary traditions. A similar issue arises again in #151, which Dora interprets as another beverage. The word *pigmentatum* only refers to a spiced thing. It shgares the gender of wine (vinum), but that is hardly unique. Interpreting it as a sauce makes more sense in the context.\n\nThe Latin term \u201cby art\u201d used in #152 suggests that these are what we would later call \u2018made dishes\u2019, combinations of ingredients that relied on flavourings like herbs and spices. The word implies a professional skill that goes beyond the mere act of cooking.\n\nIn #153, we are on safer ground. Reading piperata as a sauce is again interpretation, but my reading agrees with Dora\u2019s. The original word only means something made with pepper, but given it is poured over foods, it is quite clearly a sauce. This may be the origin of the *pfeffer* sauces so frequently found in German medieval cuisine later.\n\nWe do not know what was mixed with the vinegar in #154, but this could be an early form of the \u2018green sauce\u2019 of fresh herbs, spices, and a sour liquid, or perhaps of an infused vinegar. It is not just vinegar alone, which was also used as a condiment at the table. The issue with #156 is similar: We do not know what kind of herbs are meant here. The word could refer to greens in general, a dish similar to creamed spinach, but it is much more likely that it is a sauce or relish. Many Roman sauces depended on fresh herbs ground to a paste, and we still enjoy pesto made in much the same way. Finally, #157 once more leaves much unsaid. A *mixtura* is just a mixture. Herbs or spices are suggested by its context and I could well imagine a mix of salt and powdered dried herbs, but we cannot be sure.\n\nSimilarly, though the mustard of #155 and the spices of #158 are clearly condiments, we learn nothing about them. Was the mustard made with honey and wine (as is attested from Mediterranean sources around this time) or with vinegar or water? In what form were the spicves brought to thec table, and which kinds? Are we looking at pieces meant to be chewed, an incense to be burned, or powders to be added to food? Would there be mixtures of spices, and if so, which ones? We have a rough idea of availability \u2013 pepper, cinnamon, cumin, cloves and ginger \u2013 but no hints as to how they were used.\n\nThus at the end of it even if we accept the interpretation that these refer to condiments, we only learn that they were used at the table, not which ones or how commonly. I personally believe that forms of Roman cooking survived for this long and thus look to earlier sources for a reconstruction, but this is no more than an educated guess.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057.

When you wish to serve it, add fresh butter to it and only let it stand for an hour, and serve it.***\n\nIt may not be exactly *H\u00fchnerfrikassee*, but still \u2026 close. This is a remarkably modern and appealing recipe, quite plain, but refined. Parsley root goes well with mace and ginger (and salt, it probably does not need saying), and cooking the chicken in meat broth prevents the flavour from leaching from the meat. Using fine bread \u2013 semel was the finest grade of wheat bread commercially produced \u2013 as a thickening agent is common in the medieval corpus, and it works well if you stir and mash it conscientiously or use a stick blender.The original sauce would most likely have been passed though a sieve though the instructions are not recorded.\n\nNote that if you are using modern breeds of meat chicken, you can considerably reduce the cooking time and omit the butter. A soup chicken would be the best bird if you are looking to approximate the original.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1eupj8p/chicken_in_a_white_sauce_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1723922083.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1eupj8p/chicken_in_a_white_sauce_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Thanks so much for the interesting backstory!"]}

I picked out a recipe from the [tried and tested](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/28/hamburger-kloben-1830/) 1830 Hamburgisches Koch-Buch:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64hyy0ctepgd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e067b2d5dc8b4662caaae65806ac535e01ac147\n\n**Bisquit**\n\n***You take six eggs and weigh out an equal weight of sugar and the weight of four eggs in flour. Breat the whites of the eggs to a snow, put the sugar into the yolks and beat this well with a wooden spoon, then stir in the whites and now, gradually, the flour. You can well add a little grated lemon peel or or a few drops of orange water. You can also easily use two more yolks to six eggs; then you must also use more sugar, but not more flour. You dust it with finely sieved sugar from above in its moulds. You also lay finely cut citron on top. The flour must be fine or dry. (14.73, p. 459)***\n\nI wanted to see how well a dough with no leavening other than beaten egg whites would hold up, and for all its daunting reputation the technique worked easily. Of course in the absence of a maidservant, I had to rely on an electric mixer to first beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, then the egg yolks and sugar until they turned white.This would have taken hours to do by hand. I then folded the whites into the egg yolk mix and the flour, together with some lemon peel, into the combination. Everything held up well and made bubbly noises when agitated.\n\nThen I decided not to follow my instinct. While I feared that this would be a sticky and uncooperative mixture, the recipe clearly mentioned moulds, so I picked out some of my smoother, shallower cake tins and greased them liberally. The cakes went into the oven at 175\u00b0C and rose and browned beautifully.\n\nUnfortunately, when the time came to take them out of the oven and try them, it turned out there was no earthly way to remove them from their tins. In every other way, it was a brilliant success \u2013 a light, airy crumb surrounded by a thin, brittle crust, a hint of lemon and a melting sweet note, but the only way to eat it is to spoon it from the tin. Next time, I will pipe it out onto baking paper. I am sure it will hold together well enough to make letters and figures, and a greater crust-to-crumb ration will help with that.\n\nAnd that was what I did on my Sunday evening.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ek4io6/a_failed_cake_experiment_c_1830/", "created_utc": 1722801991.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ek4io6/a_failed_cake_experiment_c_1830/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Would parchment paper work?"]}

This is probably a good time to recall that monks such as its author were not supposed to be eating any of this. However, as quite senior members of the imperial church, men like Ekkehart would be called on to host or attend banquets for the nobility where such things were served. Beyond listing the different kinds of meat, the Benedictiones give us some useful pointers to reconstruct how they might haver been prepared and served.\n\nBlessing #97 indicates what qualities were valued in meat. Today, people favour lean cuts, but here, the author hopes for the veal \u2013 probably of a very young animal as male calves were eaten soon after birth \u2013 to become fatter. Of course fat meats were much rarer then.\n\nThe goats addressed in #100-102 are given three names: *Capelle* seems to be an unusual diminutive of *caper* and may mean a young animal. *Haedus* (here rendered *edus*) means specifically a young goat, in modern parlance a kid, in Classical Latin. Caper is the usual word for an adult billy goat. It is where we get the word capering from. There are no mentions of female animals, which may suggest that these were young billy goats raised specifically for meat.\n\nWe also find several words for specific dishes. The term *crustamina* in #103 is unusual. It seems to derive from *crusta*, a crust, shell, or rind. This may be the hard skin or caramelised outside of roasted meats, or possibly a dough shell of some kind, but it could plausibly refer to many other foods. The interpretation as a roast depends mainly on the gloss *assamina* found in the manuscript. I would consider the possibility of either covering a piece of meat with water paste for roasting, or endoring it by drizzling it with batter while it cooks. Either make interesting options and would vary the resulting dish. Meanwhile, the description in #114 is clear: *Veru* means a roasting spit, *assare* is to roast or fry. This is a spit roast, most likely of pork.\n\nThe *refrixis* mentioned in #115 suggest parboiled and subsequently roasted or fried meat to me. Dora favours the interpretation as \u201ccooled\u201d, but specifically notes that the word could equally mean \u201cfried\u201d or \u201croasted\u201d. Since parboiling before roasting is documented as a common practice later, I consider this the more plausible reading. What I am not sure of is whether we would be talking about large pieces of meat roasted on a spit, small ones cooked in a pan, or maybe bite-sized pieces on skewers. In all cases, boiling would help with tough, sinewy cuts.\n\n*Carnes* *conflictas* (plural) in #111 derives from *confligo* which means to beat or strike repeatedly. I interpret this as chopped meat, perhaps a kind of meat loaf or a dish of small pieces fried in a pan, but it could also mean meat that is tenderized by beating as a Schnitzel is today. Without the context, it is impossible to be sure.\n\nWhen we come to pork, as wioth the goat we find a number of terms. Both male (verres) and female (suilla) animals as well as piglets (porcellum) are eaten. The word *verres*, incidentally, always refers to an uncastrated domestic boar. The wild boar is *aper* (see #120 to follow). We also find words for specific cuts. Blessing #104 mentions *armo,* a Germanic borrowing which means the foreleg of an animal, probably the shoulder of a pig, here. *Lardum* (also *laridum*) in #110 is a broad term for fat pork, not specifically lard. This is the cut from which bacon is produced, but *laridum* is not necessarily salt-cured. Here, it is served boiled which suggests that it is some kind of cured and maybe smoked pork belly.\n\nFinally, the word *vexilla* in #106 refers to outward signs that are carried for display. Originally, flag-like *vexilla* were carried in the Roman army, and the tradition survives in Christian processions to this day. That practice was very likely familiar in St Gall, and this line could refer quite literally to those physical procession flags. The reason they are mentioned here, though, is that they rhyme with *suilla* (sow).\n\nUnlike with the fish, we have no specific mention of spices or seasonings with the meat dishes. That may simply be an oversight. As a monk, Ekkehart was likely far more familiar with the fish he was permitted to eat than with the technically forbidden meat of four-footed animals, so he may not have cared enough. It is also possible, though, that there is a systematic pattern at play. We will see that there are several entries that probably refer to condiment sauces, and these could be what seasons meat. It is not certain, but it would be in keeping with both Roman and later medieval practice.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057. Theyare a collection of blessings to be spoken over food. Written in short rhyming couplets in Latin, they are unusual in their attention to the diversity of foods and preparations. This is not a serious work of theology or medicine, but an intellectual diversion, playful verse meant to show off a broad vocabulary and facility with Latin. That is what makes them very valuable \u2013 they give us a glimpse of the mental horizon of a senior cleric of the 11th century at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ehohty/blessings_for_meat_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1722538173.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ehohty/blessings_for_meat_11th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Thanks, with such interesting content you may just have redeemed Reddit!"]}

These are basic fritters, but the shape distinguishes them:\n\n[A Schaube and one of the possible hats worn with it, courtesy of wikimedia commons](https://preview.redd.it/fjxchj19qr7d1.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=517220ae079811b405a9afe32cdf8521f6cfe651)\n\n***108 If you want to fry schaub hiettla (hats)***\n\n***Take 8 egg yolks on the table and a little more cream than there are yolks, and a good lump of fat, as much as to spread on a slice of bread (wie an ain geschmaltztes brott). Beat the eggs well together and salt them. Stir in fine flour and prepare the dough as though for hares\u2019 ears (hasen nerla dayg). Break off pieces as large as a walnut and roll them out in discs (gescheyblat). Lay them in a dish, and when you want to fry them, place them on an iron spoon beforehand and immerse the spoon in the fat with the dough sheet (bledlin). Thus it will be shaped like a hat. Turn them around quickly so they do not become brown.***\n\nI am not entirely sure what a *schaub hietla* is, but *hietla* is clearly the diminutive of hat. A Schaube is a male outer garment worn by wealthy people, especially academics and officials, and the hat may be associated with it, but that is uninformed speculation. I am no expert on clothing.\n\nCertainly the fritter is interesting. It is very rich with cream and fat, almost like a modern cookie dough, and reallys looks better fit for baking than frying. The shape it is given over a metal spoon would not hold up in an oven, though, so that is most likely why it went into the pan. Note how it is carefully lowered into the fat still attached to the spoon \u2013 these must have been fragile things. My problem in reconstructing them is that while I am sure everybody then knew what kind of hat they were supposed to look like, I have no idea which of the many different kinds of sixteenth-century headwear to copy. I could absolutely see shaping the dough over an inverted cupcake pan, though.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

hair\n\nThe short and the long\n\nAnd attach hats to them.\n\nAnd if they use woollen breeches\n\nThey wear them underneath\n\nThus they have taken counsel\n\nLike their forebears did out of need.\n\nFrom fine sheep\n\nCome rich heraldic overcoats (wapencleit)\n\nBlankets and Horse covers (? coopertur)\n\nCome from excellent sheep.\n\nMany people profit from this\n\nAnd look very well\n\nRam\u2019s horns are fitted to helmets\n\nSmall and large ones\n\nThe rams also carry crooked horns\n\nThose are suited as lamps\n\nThe kunig speaks much of sheep\n\nBut he himself has not even one\n\nVery well, I will take care to be in the company\n\nOf those who have them, here I am.\n\nEach archbishop\n\nIf he comes to court\n\nMust have a pallium\n\nThat must come from sheep\n\nThe

willingly\n\nMay His kingdom be open to us\n\nSo we can all get into it\n\nThus help us His mother.\n\n  \nWhen we compare this poem to the ones the same author addressed to the [cow](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/13/in-praise-of-the-cow/), the [chicken](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/31/in-praise-of-chickens/), and the [goose](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/21/in-praise-of-the-goose/), it becomes clear how little the sheep was esteemed in culinary terms. He dutifully mentions meat, innards, and the galantines made from it as well as the milk, cheese, and (interestingly) butter, but his heart is not in it. Not even lamb, a seasonal delicacy of spring, gets a second look. People ate sheep, there are surviving recipes, but clearly it was not something you would choose to do if you had other options.\n\nBy contrast, the wool and leather evoke lengthy and detailed verse. Clearly, this is where the author sees the true purpose of the animal: Sheep will make you rich. That was a fairly new phenomenon in the fourteenth century, when land for grazing became available as population declined from disease and famine while an ever more sophicsticated cloth industry called for more raw material. In this respect, the poem is less a tale of tradition and more investment advice. The focus is clearly on cloth and clothing that can be made of wool.\n\nThere are many other points of interest here if daily life fascinates you. From the string of the *wollensleger* (tasked with cleaning and preparing wool for carding) to those of stringed instruments, from horn used in lanterns to wool wrapped around blisters or coloured strings braided into hair, we get a glimpse of medieval life. I am not quite certain how to interpret the \u201cwoollen breeches\u201d that are worn by women \u201cunderneath \u2026 like their forebears did out of need\u201d. It may be a reference to menstrual hygiene \u2013 the question how possible devices for collecting menstrual blood was work is a vexing one for lack of evidence. Few writers are willing to discuss this topic at all, but the K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald seems like the type who would. If that is what it means, it is certainly hidden in too many layers of euphemism to allow for a confident reconstruction.\n\nFinally, the thing I found most endearing and tempting to reconstruct is the *lederlaken*, painted bedsheets made of sheepskin. Adorned with animals and sea creatures by a competent artist \u2013 the author specifically makes this point \u2013 they sound both visually attractive and pleasant to use. If I ever get to the point of making a proper tent and camp equipment, this will be an item to consider.\n\nDer K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald (literally king of the Odenwald, a mountain chain in southern Germany) is an otherwise unknown poet whose work is tentatively dated to the 1340s. His title may refer to a senior rank among musicians or entertainers, a Spielmannsk\u00f6nig, but that is speculative. Many of his poems are humorous and deal with aspects of everyday life which makes them valuable sources to us today.\n\nThe identity of this poet has been subject to much speculation. He is clearly associated with the episcopal court at W\u00fcrzburg and likely specifically with Michael de Leone (c. 1300-1355), a lawyer and scholar. Most of his work is known only through the Hausbuch of the same Michael de Leone, a collection of verse and practical prose that also includes the first known instance of the Buoch von guoter Spise, a recipe collection. This and the evident relish with which he describes food have led scholars to consider him a professional cook and the author of the Buoch von Guoter Spise, but that is unlikely. Going by the content of his poetry, the author is clearly familiar with the lives of the lower nobility and even his image of poverty is genteel. This need not mean he belonged to this class, but he clearly moved in these circles to some degree. Michael de Leone, a secular cleric and canon on the W\u00fcrzburg chapter, was of that class and may have been a patron of the poet. Reinhardt Olt whose edition I am basing my translation on assumes that the author was a fellow canon, Johann II von Erbach.\n\nI only translate the poems that deal with aspects of food or related everyday life here. There are several others which are less interesting as sources. They can be found in the newest extant edition by Reinhard Olt, K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald; Gedichte, Carl Winter Verlag, Heidelberg 1988.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cpqez3/in_praise_of_sheep_c_1340/", "created_utc": 1715459278.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cpqez3/in_praise_of_sheep_c_1340/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Absolutely, ABSOLUTELY love this one \ud83e\ude76"]}
{"title": "A Salernitan Meal (11th c.)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/22/a-salernitan-meal/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/22/a-salernitan-meal/)\n\nWe had this meal on Easter Saturday, so it is about time I got around to posting it. Dishes mostly based on descriptions in [*de diaetis*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Excerpts-from-Isaac-Iudaeus-de-diaetis.pdf), the 11th-century Latin text from Salerno.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mzs8dxx13wc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62ef890bb6b746c1793b895eb75cc4ace873b0ff\n\nOur main dish was chicken slowly cooked with chickpeas and spinach, a loose interpretation of this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbjal4sz13wc1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79c61941dc87b035d050f2395a57c9ebcb5bf536\n\n***\u2026The first (e.g. capons, pigeons, partridges), if they are eaten cooked with vinegar and sugar, comfort the heat of the stomach. Thus says Rufus. If they are cooked with orache and chickpeas, and a little cinnamon, they loosen the belly.***\n\nI interpreted this conservatively, as a kind of stew cooked slowly, originally probably in some kind of thick-walled pot made of soapstone or pottery. We used an enamelled cast iron pot in which we started two soup chickens in chicken stock so as to ensure the meat retained flavour. If we had had dried chickpeas, we would also have added them at this point, but we were reduced to using pre-cooked ones due to the exigencies of holiday shopping in Germany. After long morning of simmering, I took out the chickens, stripped off the meat, returned it to the pot and added about 1.2 kg of fresh spinach. After the leaves had collapsed, I added the chickpeas and seasoned the mix with cinnamon and a light touch of pepper. That really was all it needed.\n\nOur second main dish, and the vegetarian option, was based on a short passage in the chapter on eggs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52d4qxt123wc1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d3a6ac925582430b5b74ec6dcc6b946262e6def\n\n***The diversity of eggs according to their preparation is multiple. There are those which are roasted, be it in the ashes or in the coals. And some are boiled in water. Others are fried in the pan in oil or in other fat. And some are cooked in water and oil with various condiments such as onion, pepper, cumin and similar. Others are cooked with meat and herbs in sauces. (\u2026)***\n\n***But those that re cooked in water and oil and condiments are most easily digested, aid coitus and multiply sperm, especially if they are cooked with roasted meat and with hot and aromatic condiments such as pepper, cinnamon, sugar, and similar.***\n\nTogether with one on aubergines:\n\n***(\u2026) but they are of less harm if they are tempered and split and filled with salt and then much later thrown into hot water and afterwards placed in different water and washed two or three times. After then are washed in water, they will lack all their blackness and they are then boiled and, the water having been discarded, are cooked again with fat meat of cattle or sheep or pork or similar. Those who wish to eat them without meat cook them with vinegar, oil of unripe olives,*** **obsomagarum** ***and similar things.***\n\nSo, we know that eggs are cooked with meat in sauces which presumably means broken into the pot and cooked whole, not stirred in or boiled in the shell. I decided to apply this (speculative, but plausible) technique to a vegetarian preparation of eggplant and onions. This still requires an interpretation of what [*obsomagarum* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/16/how-to-cook-eggs-in-norman-sicily/)is. I believe it is a fermented sauce, possibly actually garum, but cautiously decided to go with soy sauce in this instance. The result was absolutely excellent, in my opinion the best dish in the spread. The onions were finely diced, the eggplant coarsely, and the whole cooked in a pan with the eggs broken into shallow depressions in the top towards the end. It was excellent with bread.\n\nThird, and this is based on a number of church donation documents rather than a recipe, I cooked broad beans together with millet to produce a thick porridge. This was served to the poor as a charitable donation, enriched with either olive oil or lard, and would have made a meal in itself. Here, as a side, I held back on the oil. It also worked very well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdgbgkt323wc1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e9eabc795f98db1a186794362f799cc24fd9241\n\nFinally, we had leavened light wheat bread and unleavened barley bread. Both were good, but the wheat bread (using modern cultured yeast) was more pleasant to eat. Two sauces \u2013 green herb sauce and honey mustard \u2013 were added because they were left over from the fish feast. They matched well, and both basic combinations are plausible; There is a green sauce in the Regimen Sanitatis Salernitanum and honey mustard in Palladius.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pj79mtc623wc1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a30f48eda9544d5bbe73e3c0fe76e44447d661d6\n\nFor dessert, we made apples baked in a crust again. This is a favourite: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmly6zi923wc1.jpg?width=2016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd621a67e693797dc5396cc3e5407cf11d09cc51\n\n***(\u2026) And thus it is good to eat the juice that is pressed from apples and the flesh discarded, or to find another way in which their hardness and sharpness is relieved. It is relieved in three ways, that is, by boiling in water because that way they acquire softness and humidity, or by suspending them above the steam of hot water, because that causes moistening and ripening, or by cutting them apart in the middle, removing the hard seeds inside them and in their place inserting sugar or honey, (\u2026) and they must afterwards be wrapped in some kind of dough and then placed in the ashes or coals until the dough outside is cooked. Through this art, their softness and tastiness predominates, they are quickly digested, and the harm they do to the nerves is relieved. (\u2026)***\n\nIn honour of the holiday, we further wanted some kind of Easter-themed addition and settled on bunnies. The excuse was furnished by the instruction to combine almonds and honey:\n\n***(\u2026) The oil that is extracted from them is better if their kernels are hard. But if they are first blanched (*****excorticentur*****), they should be given to eat as more digestible, more so if they are taken with honey or sugar. (\u2026)***\n\nObviously this in no way implies a paste. It could just be blanched almonds dipped in honey, or coated in it in a hot pan, or immersed in it to be taken out, or perhaps cooked into almond brittle. All of these are plausible. But I guess so is mashing them in a mortar, and this way we got bunnies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e7n803xc23wc1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbe8d9081e8233dc0f9159a2ba45556ad3555626\n\nWe liked the bunnies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cajyj8/a_salernitan_meal_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1713814490.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cajyj8/a_salernitan_meal_11th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["are those forks on your table? how very...

Today: Something the recipe collection of  Philippine Welser calls a tart (*dortten*): \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kappbwfvdlc1.jpg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=802db6b8456df621cc0bc1249c7a56aac048a7e4\n\n***41 If you want to make a tart of semel bread (semla)***\n\n***Take 10 eggs on the table, beat them well, and put grated semel bread into it. Make the filling (fyllin)  for this as though for a fladen. Take almonds, cut them small and stir  them into it. Take fat and put it into the tart pan, and do not let the  tart pan get too hot. Pour in the filling and do not let it bake for as  long as the other tarts. Check often to see that it does not stick, and  salt it.***\n\nThis is clearly not like the other tart recipes in the collection;  There is no crust. It is much more like what we would think of as a cake  or baked pudding, and what other recipes from the period describe as a [mortar cake](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/29/mortar-cake-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) or just [cake](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/02/a-very-nutmeg-y-cake-recipe/).  It is interesting that this source calls it a tart, and indicates that  terminology here is thought from the process, not the dish. This is  cooked in a tart pan, therefore it is a tart, regardless of having no  crust and no filling. Incidentally, several other recipes indicate that  top heat produced by stacking embers on the lid of the tart pan was  needed to produce a degree of fluffiness and brown the top. This was  presumably what distinguished these dishes from pancakes using identical  ingredients.   \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones.

Many of his poems are humorous and deal with aspects of  everyday life which makes them quite interesting to us today.

Put the cream over the fire and let it boil. Beat the eggs well and the  butter with them, then put them in(-to the cream) together with the  butter and let them boil up together, but not too long so it does not  become tough. Let the water run off it clear and put the rest into a  bowl. Stir it well like a porridge (mu\u00df) and add sugar. If you like, you can put in almonds and raisins. Put it on a tart base and let it bake nicely.***\n\nWhat Philippine Welser\u2019s recipebook calls an egg tart is not  something we would normally coopk today. It is based on what was known  at the time as [pressed milk](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/14/another-roast-milk-recipe/)  or egg cheese, a hard custard that shows up in recipebooks with  remarkable regularity. It could be served as it was or roasted, or, as  in this case, turned into a tart filling. While there are variations in  ingredients, in the thickness of the custard and the seasoning, but the  underlying form remains the same in all of them. \n\nInterestingly, the principle is very similar to the somewhat richer  recipe Balthasar Staindl records for a kind of tart prepared  specifically for Easter, the [*Pressmetzen*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/06/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-i/). \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rj3hn23vz1fc1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a35a51ee694e014c9d84ec8293c2b65d188aa34\n\n***Pressmetzen zu Ostern***\n\n***ccxxii Make a good gentle egg cheese (custard) and do not  burn it. Put it on a draining board so that it sinks down (drains)  well, then take the egg cheese and stir it apart with a spoon, add more  eggs, a little sweet cream, also grate semmel bread into it, yellow it (with saffron), season it, add sufficient raisins. Then take semmel bread dough from a baker, roll it out wide, put the abovementioned egg cheese on it, and wreath (kr\u00e4ntzel)  it around and around (make a plaited edge). Bake it in an oven, but  before you put it into the oven, add figs, put almonds on top. Anoint  the wreath outside with yellowed (saffron-dyed) egg yolks and put it  back into the oven briefly. These flecken (tarts) are blessed for Easter.***\n\nThese were part of the Easter celebrations, carried to church to be  blessed and then likely eaten communally. It is possible that these  tarts, too, are associated with Easter, and they are certainly seasonal  springtime foods. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

There are recipes for seasonal spring and summer dishes with these spices. \n\nSpices fell out of favour in Europe in the seventeenth century, though. The process started in France and with the court. It took a long time, and some conservative cuisines retain them to a greater degree. Now, feast day cooking is conservative.

In summer, you add isinglass so the jellied fish gel  more readily, or powdered bean flowers, tie those in a fine cloth the  size of an egg, that is especially good.***\n\nThis is almost the same text, but not quite. We can imagine it being  written down again as a copy for use in a different location and bound  together later, or maybe to reaffirm instructions, but we do not really  know the context. Both versions allow us some interesting glimpses of  how a large, wealthy kitchen was run. \n\nWhat I find interesting is the way weight and volume measures are  used interchangeably. This becomes even more pronounced in other  sections, but is already evident here as 3 pounds of almonds equal two  heaped and one level *n\u00e4pfel*. Also, there are quantities of  spices  given for the jellied fish, though we cannot reconstruct how big  a spoon the author is referring to. An interesting aside is no less  than three nostrums for ensuring the aspic would gel even in summer \u2013  isinglass, fish bones, and ground bean flower, all of which we know from  other sources. \n\nThe list of soups is impressively varied and shockingly rich. There  are none involving meat, of course, because Tegernsee was a Benedictine  house whose members were forbidden the meat of four-footed animals.   Nonetheless, this is not a deprived cuisine. Wine, dried fruit, spices,  fine white bread, fish, honey, and gingerbread all display the wealth of  what was one of Bavaria\u2019s oldest abbeys. By 1500, the dead hand of  Tegernsee held centuries\u2019 worth of pious bequests and it shows. \n\nNote that [again](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/04/dairy-dishes-a-new-and-interesting-source/),  none of these ingredient list are complete. They only list what should  be issued from stores, not whatever the kitchen had on hand or bought in  fresh. But the relations of quantities andf ingredients give us an idea  of the finished product and remind us that soups were not necessarily  simple affairs. A [hemp soup](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/23/hemp-milk-cooking/) calling for bread, fruit, and spices is clearly more complex than simply boiling hempseed for their milk.\n\nThe *haubete suppen* is interesting because the dish seems to  depend on the way the bread is cut. This is again something we have  evidence for from a number of sources. Cutting breadrolls or pieces of  bread into interesting patterns and serving them in soup see,ms to have  been an expected skill in a cook, and the description is cursory enough  to suggest people simply knew what this should look like. \n\nThe recipe collection from the monastery at Tegernsee (Bavaria) is an  unusual source. It seems to have been produced to serve very specific  practical purposes in the administration of that particular monastery,  giving quantities for dishes and instructing the reader on which days  what is to be served. A calendar and a short treatise on fishes are  written in the same manuscript, the whole produced around 1500 and in  use until at least 1534. The text was partially edited by Anton  Birlinger in Germania 9/1864 ( pp. 192-207) who regarded it as a  resource for linguistic study.

{"title": "Fried Lamb's Head (15th c.)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/14/fried-lambs-head/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/14/fried-lambs-head/)\n\n Yet another recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch, and easily the most disturbing centrepiece to a feast table in that book.  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5royhlpmb6c1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f2a3c8adf8a8ab46d8628413413619eacafc00c\n\n***131 To fry lamb heads and other heads***\n\n***Take the head of a lamb and boil it until it is done.  Take all the meat off so only the bones remain, add raw eggs, cut bacon,  pepper and caraway. Fill this seasoned stuffing (*****kondiment*****)  into the skull and put it back in place so that it becomes whole again.  Dredge the head through an egg batter and fry it in fat. Also prepare  the heads of roe deer and suckling pigs this way.***\n\nLate Medieval Germans [really loved fried things](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/29/battering-and-frying-everything-de-rontzier/). There are far too [many recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/26/some-experiments-with-fritters/) for fritters of all descriptions to [list here](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=fritter).  This is one of the more extreme examples, though. In a way, it is the  perfect marriage of the tradition of playing with food, the principle  that labour input ennobled a dish, and the carnivorous delight in animal  protein and fat that characterised much of German festive cuisine at  the time. Not only is the head boiled and defleshed, the cooked meat is  then turned into a seasoned forcemeat. I read the procedure as using  this both to fill the skull and arrange the rest around the bone  structure to mimic the muscles as they were before. The egg batter that  coats it then serves for a new \u2018skin\u2019, lending colour and crispness.  \n\n*Presskopf*, head cheese, is actually delicious, and this  combination of meat and bacon with pepper and caraway has similar  potential. Between the egg and the boiled-down connective tissues, it  probably held together reasonably well, too. The technical challenges of  the dish must still have been formidable. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

Pour peppered honey drink (******honig getranck******) or spiced honey condiment (******h\u00f6nig w\u00fcrtz******) over it and serve it., This is called infidel cakes (******haidnisch kuochen******) or isinglass (******hausen plater******).***\n\nAs a recipe, this is unremarkable. It is another iteration of the thin, crisp egg fritters known as heidnische Kuchen we find [in other sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/01/a-standard-fritter-from-the-inntalkochbuch/). The dough was familiar enough to be used as a [reference point for consistency and thickness](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/07/infidel-cake-on-a-spit-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[ in recipes for other dishes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/21/knitted-fritters-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/).  The preparation is straightforward: it is rolled out, cut into wide  strips, fried, and served with a honey sauce. So far, so good. \n\nWhat is interesting is that the Mondseer Kochbuch [also identifies a meat pie](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/14/infidel-cake-from-the-mondseer-kochbuch/) by the name of *heidnischer Kuchen*.  This is not very surprising. German recipes play fast and loose with  names, and a different recipe collection refers to the egg dish usually  known as [May cake](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/16/another-may-cake/) as [*heidnischer Kuchen*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/25/green-eggs-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/). Twice.  \n\nEven more surprising is the secondary name of isinglass (*hausen platter*).  It is repeated twice, so we can probably exclude scribal error.  Clearly, actual isinglass, the swim bladder of the Danube sturgeon used  as a source of gelatin, is not involved in the preparation. It is  possible that the fried dough sheets, curled, darkened, and twisted,  reminded people of dried swim bladders, but I wonder how familiar the  sight of this luxury ingredient in its raw form would have been.  I  really have no explanation for this. \n\nFinally, this recipe helps us better understand the \u201choney drink\u201d that is used in the earlier instructions for making[ the apple preserve *doberiz* or *dewericz*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/02/apple-preserve-and-a-fritter/). The *honig getranck* mentioned here is viewed as interchangeable with *h\u00f6nig w\u00fcrtz*.  It is clearly a kind of condiment, a made sauce, not just mead. It may  refer to honeyed spiced wine, though if that is the case, I suspect the  proportion of honey would have been much higher than in the usual  beverages. More likely, we are looking at a purpose-made spiced  condiment prominently featuring honey. Honey and pepper, incidentally,  are an excellent combination.   \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria).

This is an interesting recipe: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Detail from the Marriage Feast at Cana \\(attributed to Hieronymus Bosch\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ovh27n16yc0c1.jpg?width=578&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08cb05de07ca6e3af22ec5e930cbdc6ca4b4e6c8)\n\n \n\n***121 A boar\u2019s head with hellish flames***\n\n***If you want to prepare the head of a wild boar so that  hellish flames emerge from it, first boil it until it is done, and when  it is boiled, put it on a griddle and roast it until it is brown. Cut it  in squares (*****w\u00fcrfflacht*****), but so that it stays whole (i.e. cut  squares into the skin) and strew ginger all over it on the outside. Take  a sauce bowl full of distilled liquor (*****geprantes weines*****) with ginger in it. Pour half of it down its throat (*****in den hals*****)  and drizzle the rest over it on the outside. Take dry bread the size of  a (wal-)nut and make a hole in the middle of it. Put a glowing pebble  the size of a bean into it. Do this as you are about to serve it, and  thrust that into its throat. Hold its mouth open (*****sperre im das maul auf*****)  with a red apple and let it be brought in quickly. When people touch it  because they want to eat it, it catches fire from the liquor and from  the pebble so that hellish fire emerges from it, green and blue. It  smells of violets and does no harm.***\n\nThis is an interesting party trick and I wonder if it actually works.  Parboiling, cutting and roasting a boar\u2019s head was the standard  preparation method. Here, the head is then served booby-trapped: As  diners touch the liquor-soaked head, a red-hot pebble is dislodged from a  secure bed of bread and ignites the alcohol. Spectacular, but harmless  flames will emerge from the mouth and engulf the entire dish. \n\nPlaying with fire was a recurring theme in late medieval and  Renaissance fine dining, where showy display was prized. This piece is  an example of rather robust humour, but alcohol burns at a low  temperature and is unlikely to cause damage. We find a similar dish  depicted in the [Marriage Feast at Cana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_Feast_at_Cana_(Bosch))  attributed to Hieronymus Bosch (see picture). Here, though, the fire is  lit before the head is served and emerges from the mouth only. The  principle is the same. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

I started out shelling and boiling the pumpkin, then drained it  to the best of my abilities and passed it through the medium disc of my  foodmill. The result was quite watery, but I decided to give it a try  anyway, mixing about  1 1/2 cups of it with four egg yolks, a dab of  melted butter and a small amount of milk. My choice of seasoning was  pepper and the unmentioned, but likely implied salt. It went into a pie  shell made of leftover hot water paste according to a sixteenth-century  recipe and into a moderate oven. \n\n It worked surprisingly well, though the filling took a long time to  set. That would likely have worked better if I has used a flatter dish.  The pie cut easily and held together well enough to be sliced into  bite-sized pieces. The flavour took getting used to, but once you get  over the ingrained idea that a pumpkin pie needs to be sweet, it is  actually quite good with salt and pepper. A little mace would have  worked well with it. Still, I ate much of it with chutney or other  relishes. It is rather bland on its own. \n\nFor future note: I think the recipe will be improved by baking in a  flatter dish, and the pumpkin flesh should be drained very thoroughly  before it is mashed. The less water it brings in, the more can the milk  and butter carry its flavour. Finally, though Coler is clear on using a  single spice, a mixture of sharp spices is likely to work much better. \n\nI might also use sugar instead of salt, but that is surely a bridge too far.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17q3xd3/sixteenthcentury_german_pumpkin_pie/", "created_utc": 1699389735.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17q3xd3/sixteenthcentury_german_pumpkin_pie/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

{"title": "How come nobody noticed that boiling makes water safer to drink before trains were invented?

Ditto with tea where they even directly water sources from rivers, lakes, and ponds  and other outdoor sources that haven't been cleaned and simply boil the tea materials on the spot with the water (unlike alcoholic beverages which has multiple other steps and not just boiling like fermentation that prevents germ growth).. That the boiling kills the unhealthy germs and filters out dirt is so common on responses in Quora and on Reddit and other online sources. I seen an author named Marc MacYoung even say that the idea of prohibition against alcoholic beverages is a modern idea that only came about because of newly discovered methods int he late 19th century making water safe to directly drink and that the religious protesters in this period would have reverted to drinking beer and dropped their anti-alcohol protests when they realize how they'd quickly die from drinking water in earlier times!\n\nI'm really curious why if this is the case did nobody ever notice that boiling water they took from a pond and other nearby sources would make it safer to drink? I mean did nobody not notice in the process that ale and other drinks were boiled during the process of their production? I mean considering they literally just boil water after mixing it with leaves and other ingredients on the spot for Asian tea drinks, why did nobody ever get the idea that maybe boiling water was a big part of how they're able to drink tea without getting sick? How did people overlook one of the most basic and simplest process of creating drinks as being a possible solution for creating potable water?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17kehas/how_come_nobody_noticed_that_boiling_makes_water/", "created_utc": 1698732813.0, "score": 6, "author": "YMCALegpress", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17kehas/how_come_nobody_noticed_that_boiling_makes_water/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["The Greeks and Romans boiled water to purify it as well as various other cultures, so it wasn't as if no one figured it, it just went in and out of practice.

In beer production yeast is an infection in a manner of speaking. The spouted grain is boiled to extract sugars then it has to be cooled down before the yeast is added. The yeast might be in the form of a part of the last batch, bread or or just living in the walls of the brew house in pre-industrial societies. If added too soon the heat kills the yeast. This might prove your point but in the mind of a pre-industrial brewer boiling too much makes the beer not happen.   \n\n\nI also think it is important to examine the cliche of drinking alcohol all the time. I did an deep dive  on water use in medieval Europe. Even without germ theory there was an idea of what was good water: from a well, from a stream. Pond water was no good for drinking, people knew that. Drink from up stream of the animals. Some guy in medieval London made beer from stagnant water it was so bad college students wouldn't even drink it. He was fined.   \n\n\nIf there was a perception that water wasn't great for you it wasn't because of contamination but because it had no nutrients. They thought it would draw nutrients out of the body. Drinking beer daily (it would be like 2 or 3% alcohol) was a carb source, not a source of intoxication. Food that hasn't been process has much more moisture.   \n\n\nRoberta J. Magnusson.

Another one of the parallels from the Mondseer Kochbuch:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/927up9g8xftb1.jpg?width=567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7b6c6f40e5a507184d4fec27c004e7cf4bb9857\n\n***57 To prepare infidel peas (*****Haydenisch arbeis*****)***\n\n***Take almond kernels and pound them very small, and mix  them with a third as much honey and with good spices, the best that can  be had.

This  dish (*****koste*****) is served cold or hot.*** \n\nFirstly, the nomenclature here is a little odd. There is another dish known as \u2018infidel\u2019, the [heidnische Kuchen](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/01/a-standard-fritter-from-the-inntalkochbuch/) we encounter in [many ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/14/infidel-cake-from-the-mondseer-kochbuch/)[iterations](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/25/green-eggs-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/). we do not know why these were called that, either. The double naming in the *Buoch von guoter Spise*  does, of course, make every medievalist\u2019s ears perk up: Bohemia\u2019s  association with unbelief seems to offer an explanation. Unfortunately,  the timing is off. The *Buoch* is conventionally dated to the 1380s, well before the Hussite wars. Also, there is a well documented [dish called Bohemian peas](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/29/all-about-peas-part-one/).  It actually involves peas that are shelled, mashed and spiced. It is  possible that the recipe recorded here is simply an illusion food meant  to imitate the appearance of mashed peas with more expensive  ingredients. \n\nReconstructing the dish is also challenging because of the aspects  left unsaid. Actually pounding almonds in a mortar and mixing them with  the indicated quantity of honey produces something very much like  marzipan. You could shape that mass into small balls to resemble peas,  but if you were to fill it into a serving bowl to look like mashed peas,  it  would be challenging to eat. However, a number of recipes instruct  the reader to pound almonds in a mortar and use the milk, so clearly the  addition of a liquid is envisioned, even if it is not explicitly  mentioned. If we were to add water during the processing, this could  become a soft mush similar to mashed peas. We simply do not know. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThe raisins have swapped places with the nuts, and some details were  lost somewhere in the transmission chain, but these are effectively the  same three fritters. We do not know exactly how krapfen were prepared at  the time, but the reference to sheets suggests a hard, pliable dough  that may not have been leavened much. Today, the word tends to refer [to soft, sweet yeast doughs with a small amount of fi](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/31/berliner/)lling. These were likely rather different, more like fried ravioli.\n\nThe recipes are, incidentally, not really a good fit for the  pre-Easter Lenten period. While some apples can last until then, but  they do not feature much in springtime recipes. Both apples and nuts are  more typical of autumn and early winter, which would make them  plausible candidates for the Advent fast which is no longer much  observed, but was obligatory in medieval Germany. I have only tried one  of these combination \u2013 the combination of raisins and apples \u2013 and found  that it really helps if the apples are not too juicy. Storing them into  winter would have made them a better fit here.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

Careful not to injure it, you should loosen the  skin all around and detach both flesh and bones and everything that is  inside the body all the way to the claws. And take a quantity as large  as two eggs of the flesh you took out and boil it until it is almost  done. And take the bacon and chop it, and add an egg and a slice of  bread and parsley and sage in measure. Fill the piglet with this, not  too full, tie up its snout and lay it into a cauldron gently and boil it  so its skin does not break. Then take it, place it on a wooden griddle  and roast it gently. When it is well roasted, take bread and lay it in a  serving bowl. Fix four sticks on a board and clad the board with dough  (?*** **pluot**, ***literally flowers) and loosen its snout and let the ears stand out, and serve it.***\n\nThis is another of the parallels with the [Buoch von Guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise), and the comparison solves one of the odder parts: The recipe instructs us to cover the servbing board in flowers (*pluot*), which is possible, but unusual. In the parallel recipe (#8), it is clad in a *blat*,  a sheet of dough, which seems more probable. The instruction to \u201clet  the ears stand out\u201d also is made clearer in the parallel where the  piglet, too, is covered in dough which is then presumably baked.\n\nAnother question I have is what is meant by the \u201ctwo eggs of the  flesh\u201d which is found in both parallels. I suspect that is a garbling  that was already in the shared source of these recipes and originally  simply referred to adding two eggs (the interpretation depends on a few  small words and could easily slip in). That would mean the meat of the  piglet is cooked in its entirety, turned into a stuffing, and filled  back into the skin which is then cooked like gefilte fish. It is also  possible that there is something more complicated going on. The  instruction to loosen the skin all the way around without damaging it  occurs in recipes for poultry that is cooked with a seasoned filling [between the skin and the meat](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/06/seasoning-a-goose-under-the-skin/).  The way a pig\u2019s skin attaches to the flesh with fatty tissue between  would make this challenging, but it is something I could easily imagine  as a showy dish.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

Returning to the[ Innsbruck MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Innsbrucker-Rezeptbuch.pdf) for a bit of local flavour: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llhfkhccbsbb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acd4f3f9720ccf97a79464bfde9dc7925c4f76cc\n\n***121 If you would prepare a brown sauce, take strawberries and*** **semel** ***bread and pass it through with wine etc.***\n\n***122 Item a blue sauce, take blueberries and also prepare them in this manner with*** **semel** ***bread and wine etc.***\n\n***123 Item a sauce of raspberries (*****holper*****): pound them and pass them through with wine and spice them so they are sweet, or also add honey to it etc.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7no7rkqdbsbb1.jpg?width=478&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a8d779eb967f9e29290af2a63a72d6358ef9bb3\n\n By the sixteenth century, some foreign visitors remark on the German  habit of using fruit in cooking, and we have a good deal of  documentation for that, mostly featuring apples and pears. These sauces  are a rarer survival, and I suspect they are a seasonal treat.\n\nStrawberries, blueberries and raspberries at the time were almost  entirely foraged, not grown for the market. They were also smaller than  our cultivated varietals, especially the [European forest strawberry](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/06/strawberry-tart-and-why-varietals-matter/).  This made them laborious to gather and hard to transport over any  longer distances. They were available locally and seasonally, sometimes  in large quantities, but never predictably. With sugar preservation not  yet widespread, they were very likely eaten fresh, turned into fruit  purees and \u2013 as we see here \u2013 sauces. \n\nWe do not know whether these sauces are meant to be cooked. If they  are, it is possible they  functioned as preserves. However, looking at  how they are prepared I think it is more likely they are meant to be  eaten fresh. There is little point adding wine only to boil it out  again, and long-lasting fruit sauces are usually not bound with grated  bread. Thus we are looking at berry purees aromatised  with wine and  slightly thickened with grated white bread. Personally, I am most  partial to the raspberry sauce with cinnamon and honey, a redaction I  included in my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook), but all three are very nice with roast meat. \n\nUnfortunately, much as we would love to imagine them accompanying  rich, dark meat and thick roasts \u2013 and they are wonderful with a nice  pork loin and divine with goose \u2013 seasonality dictates this is unlikely.  Unless you were hunting, summertime meats would mainly be chicken and,  expensively, lamb and suckling pig. They are good in that combination,  but nothing stops us from making full use of modern preservation  technology to enjoy them when they are at their most welcome. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes.

Then take the net (caul) and put it on the table and when it hardens,  wrap it in the net and place it on a griddle, and put two or three  pieces of wood onto it to turn it over with. That way it does not break  apart when it is roasted. Cut it into seven pieces in a bowl, and what  you cut off, grind up and pass it through a cloth with good spices and  good wine. That way it turns out good. Then take the brain and place it  on a cloth, tie it together and boil it with the cloth or inside it, and  when it is boiled, take a pound of almonds and grind them up small with  good broth or soup. Pass it through a cloth with fine white wheat bread  and pass the brain through with the other things, and take clean fat,  and boil it. Also take a good wine and the blood of the calf, but not  too much of the blood. Then take good dry lebkuchen, not too little,  grind it up small and put it in. If you don\u2019t have sugar, use honey  instead and clean fat, that way it turns out smooth. Season it with good  spices and take that in right measure, a good sprinkling of spices on  top.***\n\n***Recipe # 191 (no title)***\n\n***Take the lung of a calf and wash it nicely, and boil it  in a pot and chop it small. Take good broth or soup and twelve egg yolks  and cook that together, that is a good spoon dish.***\n\n***Take the head of the calf, wash it nicely, take it off  cleanly and cut it into small patches, and cook it with good spices and  saffron and parsley.***\n\n***Take the breast and a roastable meat of what animal you  find or may get and chop it small, and take the blood, and don\u2019t make it  too black once it is done. Then take rye bread and grate it small. Take  the blood and sixty-there eggs, beat them with it, and also add the  grated bread, and chop it small and add good spices and cook it nicely  with cloves, and of the bread take half or more, you make the roast with  it.***\n\n***Also take a small kettle and put in broth or soup and  place it over a burning fire, then take the roast and put it in there  and let it boil until it is done. When it is well ready, take it out and  let it cool, then take bacon, cut it up small, lard the roast with that  and also stick it with whole cloves. Then take good wine with it, and  good spices, and sugar, and prepare a soup to go with the roast.***\n\n***Of the roast: take the long (parts? \u2013 filet strips cut  along the kidney roast?) together and place it in hot broth and let it  boil till it is done. Do not let it overcook, and when it is done, place  it on the table if you wish, and let it cool. Now you may cut it as you  wish. Afterwards, make a bound pepper sauce of it, and take onions and  an apple with it, chop it up into that, and take fat from the meat and  the blood into a pan and add it, make it cleanly, with good spices. That  way it is (like) venison.***\n\n***And the breast you cut lengthwise, that is served as a  meat (dish). And you shall take the legs that still have meat on them  and chop them into small pieces and take a soup or broth of the meat,  with vinegar added, and the blood of the calf should also be added, and  boil it in there. And put in chopped (meat or organs) with good bacon,  and season it with good spices. That makes a good first course dish.***\n\nI addressed this text previously in my presentation to the [Oxford Symposium 2016](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n80MEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)  and am happy to put it here at this point because it is such an  interesting look at the challenges of a court cook. Nobles often  travelled, and they expected to eat in their accustomed style while on  the road. Supply networks could be patchy at the best of times, and when  all you could get was a calf, you made do. \n\nThe passage can be hard to interpret. It jumps back and forth between  the first and third person and the imperative, and few instructions it  gives are anything like complete. However, some cross-referencing can  help give us an idea what is going on. Initially, the  head is turned  into a \u2018head dish\u2019 that may be something like [*presskopf* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/28/brawn-from-the-innsbruck-ms/)\u2013  the reference further down to chopping the meat into smasll bits  suggests as much. The feet are boiled for gelatin, presumably used to  encase meat and serve it cold as a [galantine](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/22/meat-in-aspic-from-cgm-384-ii/). \n\nThis is followed by a description of something that looks a lot like a bread pudding, a kind of [dumpling mass](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/10/experiment-bread-dumplings/) of bread and bacon cooked inside of a stomach. The other stomachs \u2013 ruminants have a handy number of them \u2013 are [cooked, sliced up, and served in a dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/09/the-ancestry-of-kuttelfleck/)  with other organ meats. We get told nothing of the details \u2013 they could  be spiced or served in a sauce, fried or roasted after parboiling, or  several of these things.  A good cook would know situationally how to go  about this. \n\nThe liver, mashed, spiced, and wrapped in a caul as a kind of sausage, must have been familiar to [every cook](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/22/a-stuffed-liver-roasted-in-a-caul-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/) [considering ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/15/another-liver-in-a-caul-recipe/)[how often](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/05/liver-in-a-caul-from-cgm-384-ii/) it[ shows up](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/12/liver-roasted-in-caul-from-meister-eberhard/) in[ the sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/16/liver-wrapped-in-caul-from-the-konigsberg-ms/). Meanwhile the brain is boiled in a bag and turned into a [soft spoon dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/16/mus-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/)  with almonds, something not uncommon at the time either. The lungs are  cooked with eggs, though we are not entirely sure how. This could be a  treatment similar to the [lung ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/05/new-source-lung-fritters-from-cgm-384/)[fritters ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/17/lung-fritters-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)we[ find in](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/12/calf-lung-fritters-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/) so [many sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/31/calf-lung-fritters-from-cod-pal-germ-551/), but it looks more like a spoon dish or maybe an omelet-like dish. \n\nSome of the most prized br\u00e4t, the meat suitable for roasting, gets turned into a [*f\u00fcrhess*\\-like](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/25/two-furhess-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/) dish in a [spicy ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/17/bohemian-and-hungarian-sauce-recipes/)[blood sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/18/blood-sauce-for-venison-from-ggm-349/).   Another part is parboiled and roasted to be served with a sweet  wine-based sauce. Another part yet is boiled in broth, and in the end it  is not entirely clear what kind of sauce is used on which kind of meat,  but we get another mention of blood as a binding agent as well as the  word [*pfeffer* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/19/two-pepper-sauce-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/)which suggests a [spicy bread-bound sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/22/pepper-sauces-for-fish-from-cgm-384-ii/).\n\nThe final spread, with a wide range of flavours and consistencies  produced from a single animalk, may owe its existence to improvisation,  but in no way feels constrained or limiting, especially as we must  imagine it accompanied by bread, egg and dairy side dishes, and  vegetables that go unmentioned. Whoever the somewhat enigmatic Meister  Hans was, he had reason to be proud. \n\nWith this, I am taking my leave into the summer holidays. The  frequency of my posts is liable to reduce further as I take my son on a  trip to Southern Germany, so I ask your forbearance \u2013 I have not  forgotten you and I will get to another source or three come time.

The recipes themselves are written in a  South German dialect and it is not quite clear what makes them either  Bohemian or Hungarian and which is which. Nonetheless, they are among  our earliest writen records of Central East European cuisine and thus of  interest. \n\n \n\n[Dining scene from the Bible of King Wenceslas \\(Bohemia, c. 1390-1400\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4glu8wm4mm6b1.jpg?width=424&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1064d42f4f2a9bdca50e447fd615a2d6d7b32498)\n\nI started a translation quite a while ago and now finally took the  time to complete and check it.

Take a little fat into a pan, only enough  to cover the bottom, and pour the eggs into it. Make very thin sheets  and also make sheets from the yolks. Spread the sheets (with) roast  apples or with raisins or figs and then roll them over each other (*****welig si dann uber ein ander*****) and cut them like fatty sausage (***[**rosen wurst**](https://www.wurst.de/tradition/druckanekdote.php?id=wurstichitaet&descr=Die%20Wurstichit%E4t)***).  Stick 4 or 5 of them on a skewer of wood. Prepare a batter and roll  them in it, then fry them, withdraw the skewers, and cut them open  lengthwise.***\n\nI will write about the details of this later, but today I want to  look at the things I tried with the batter because I think it is useful  for getting how the ubiquitous *strauben* batter worked. The  problem started as one of translation because the original German does  not distinguish between a batter or a dough. The word *Teig* covers everything from pancakes to black bread. But clearly, what they made strauben of had certain rather specific qualities.\n\nThe expression *Straubenteig*, which I translate as a *strauben* batter, comes up in [many ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/26/a-wreath-of-many-colours/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/24/egg-filled-fritters/)whenever something needs to be coated before it is fried. However, *strauben* themselves  are a fritter that is pulled between the hands and dropped into hot  fat, not something you would typically associate with a liquid. Either  there is a kind of semantic drift that makes strauben more solid or *straubenteig* more liquid, or something else was going on. My suspect was gluten.\n\n \n\n[This batter held together well](https://preview.redd.it/ljmvk55gk14b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ceefbcdd5a4c02cceb9a68f4462d0746c43773)\n\nToday, I made a simple batter of two eggs, a cup of milk, and enough  wheat flour to produce a thick liquid. I added some warm water and yeast  because strauben are sometimes recorded as leavened. Then, I simply  kept stirring it until it started to produce bubbles, developing the   gluten in the flour, and leaving it to rise. \n\nWhen the time came to coat the  fritters in this batter, it turned  out surprisingly difficult. I ended up using two spoons to effectively  wrap the batter around the filling, which actually matches the word of  the recipe \u2013 welig, to wrap or roll \u2013 pretty well. The resulting crust  rose nicely in the pan and held together despite its fluffy softness,  and it sliced easily enough. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Challenging to 'roll' the fritters](https://preview.redd.it/7ggq2dxik14b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66602afb0c36b3b6416ba92d4651a9af612b93b1)\n\n After coating and frying the last of the rolled-up egg, I had a little  of the batter left, and I was curious. Quickly dipping my fingers in  cold water as the recipes for strauben instruct us, I grasped part of it  and scooped it up in my cupped fingers, then quickly pulled it with the  fingers of my other hand and dropped it into the hot pan. It worked  surprisingly well, so I repeated the operation with the rest of it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hand-pulled Strauben](https://preview.redd.it/xxiodjmlk14b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a12d605423a1f9d3f280baf4d7ad7224e933ab)\n\nI think that may well be the reason why *Straubenteig* behaves both as a batter and a dough \u2013 both senses of *Teig* in  German. Of course I could also be completely wrong and the recipe  simply calls for rolling up the egg in a dough sheet and frying that. I  don\u2019t think that is likely, but it needs to be considered and probably  tried out just to see how it goes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/140l4u6/figuring_out_straubenteig/", "created_utc": 1685902149.0, "score": 8, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/140l4u6/figuring_out_straubenteig/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

There are [other references to *Hohlbraten*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/30/roasted-meat-loaf-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) and  the idea of filling something into the hole left by the spit \u2013 often  scrambled eggs \u2013  but here, the principle is exploited to the full. It  really is more like a [*Baumstriezel* or *kurtosh kolach*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCrt%C5%91skal%C3%A1cs) made of meat, cooked on a deliberately large wooden centre. That [tradition](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/20/spieskuchen-from-cod-pal-germ-551/), too, [already existed](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/11/sixteenth-century-spieskuchen/),  so the inspiration may have come from there. I am not entirely sure how  hard this would be to get right, but I think I would like to try it  just to see what happens. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.

If I read it correctly, the idea behind *in dem dampf*  is to cook the onions in a closed container with no additional liquid,  the way apple purees are sometimes prepared. An example of this  technique is recipe #2 in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf).  More usually, onions are chopped and then either cooked in a liquid   directly or initially fried in fat. Cooking them in their own steam may  well produce a more concentrated flavour, much as it does with apples,  if the consistency comes out correctly. Thickening the mix with bread  may not be necessary at all, and I can envision it going very well with  vinegar, butter, and sharp spices like pepper, nutmeg, or cardamom. I  may have to try this. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

These recipes are two previously posted [varieties ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/10/dumplings-with-boiled-veal-from-the-oeconomia/)of [bread dumplings](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/13/dumpling-recipes-from-the-oeconomia-part-three/) from the Oeconomia ruralis et domestica:\n\n[Three flour dumpling varieties, Krapfen, and veal dumplings](https://preview.redd.it/43l3o355c3ta1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=892cae7253f53a80bce1a5214add1114aeee1ce2)\n\n***(marginalia: To make dumplings in another way)***\n\n***Or take white bread (Semmel),  lay them in water and let them soften in it. When it is soft, press out  the water cleanly and put fried bacon on it, take finely chopped thyme  and stir that in. Then break pure (bahr)  eggs into it and add pepper and saffron. Then take flour and stir it  all together so that it becomes like a dough and place one dumpling (kl\u00fcp) after another into the (boiling) veal with a spoon when the meat is done, and let it boil up together.***\n\n[Kn\u00f6del dough](https://preview.redd.it/foqb90lcc3ta1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc5a833ed2efedeb156e6a538291a6b1749b29ae)\n\nThis one is quite close to the way we still make *Semmelkn\u00f6del* today,  though we usually add  toasted or fried bread cubes rather than bacon.  We opted for a cautious approach, following the modern way, and it  worked out well. Four breadrolls, three eggs, half a cup of chopped  bacon, and just enough  flour to bind it together. The dumplings cooked  slowly in barely simmering water until they rose to the surface, and the  result was quite satisfying.\n\nAnd the other:\n\n[Dumpling with onion sauce](https://preview.redd.it/fzv1t8pgc3ta1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0138dfb90db63b0bc2d96d8f5f64b1109e7e1f6)\n\n***To make flour dumplings*** (**Meelkloesse)**\n\n***(marginalia: to make flour dumplings)***\n\n***Cut the crust off a Semmel and cut cubes (viereckichte stuecklein) of bacon and fry it together in a pan.

Then scatter (schuette) fine wheat flour on the fried matter (das geroehste), pour on the mixed matter (das gequirlete),  and do not make the dumplings too hard and not too thin. First of all,  set water to boil by the fire, and when it boils, lay the dumplings into  it with a spoon. If you wish to cook meat with them, boil the meat in a  separate pot and add it to the dumplings.***\n\nThis is a little stranger, and also not as easily interpreted. I  opted to read it as clusters of toasted bread pieces held together by a  batter. We cubed the bread and that bacon, broiwned both in a pan and  let them cool. Then we dusted them heavily with flour and added the egg  mix, stirring until everything was coated. The dumplings were a  challenge to shape, takiung just the right amount of pressure between  wet hands so as not to disintegrate, and I used a spoon to lower them  into the water. Against my expectations, they held togeher and came out  quite tasty.\n\nThis recipe, incidentally, may be broadly related to a bread pudding described in [Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-Meister-Hans.pdf) (recipe #190):\n\n***Now he takes the innards of it and washes it nicely and  makes it nice and takes bacon and fine white  bread that he cuts into  cubes.

Sunday\u2019s experimental sessions included a simple, but quite pleasing  dish. It is based on a description in [Alexandre Exquemelin\u2019s *Bucaniers of America*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Exquemelin). The English version of 1684 has this passage:\n\n***The second fruit, necessary unto humane life, which here  they tryed, was Potatoes. These  come not to perfection in lesser time,  then four, or five months. On these they most commonly make their  breakfasts, every morning. They dress them no otherwise, then boyling  them in a kettle, with  fair water. Afterwards they cover them with a  cloath, for the space of half an hour, by which manner of dressing they  become as soft as boyled Chestnuts.***\n\n[ Sweet potatoes, cooked in a small amount of water in a pot covered with a linen cloth. ](https://preview.redd.it/nlkgpbie7wqa1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=392f9fb3b63a56a607b13cfed193089cf27fa2da)\n\nThe description found in the Dutch and German editions differs  slightly, in that it  speaks of a small amount of water and specifies  that the kettle is covered with a cloth. It also includes a sentence  omitted in the English version:\n\n***They eat them with butter and also make a sauce of lemon/lime juice (Limonien), pig fat and Spanish pepper***.\n\n[ Pimentade sauce after Exquemelin, pig fat mixed with dried chili, salt,  and lemon juice. The resulting paste melts when applied to warm potatoes  and is quite pleasant, though hot.  ](https://preview.redd.it/r5zw2poh7wqa1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bed4490f96ce42a41d94f4126b7801da00ba819)\n\nThe \u2018they\u2019 mentioned here are the French settlers on Tortuga, home of  the early buccaneering fleets operating under the fig leaf of French  privateering commissions. Exquemelin is describing this environment  based on his own experience, having lived on Tortuga and sailed with the  buccaneers, but his account is not necessarily the most accurate. That  is why we are grateful to have a description of a very similar condiment  from another source, the work of Jean Baptiste Labat, a Dominican friar  who was posted to the French Antilles in the 1680s:\n\n***They (the Native Americans) place the meat, the fish, or the crabs in the other dish with a bowl full of*** **pimentade**,  ***that is to say the juice of manioc (cassava) that they caused to boil  down and into which they ground a quantity of pepper with lemon juice.  This is their favourite sauce and served with all manner of fish and  meat, and they make it so strong that there are few (others) to whom it  can be served.***\n\nThis suggests that the sauce described by Exquemelin was both a  borrowing from Native American cuisine and, as we often find in the  foods of European settlers, adapted to European traditions. In this  case, the addition of animal fat, a coveted status ingredient in  seventeenth-century European cooking, transformed a relatively light,  strongly flavoured condiment of the local tradition into a rich,  unctuous European sauce that could now accompany a carbohydrate-rich  main dish.\n\n[ A  different interpretation of pimentade with fresh chilis, more lemon  juice and less lard, using cooked onion as a thickener. It was served  last year and also successful.  ](https://preview.redd.it/cbek40fk7wqa1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3510b017907ae34b0ca2e02bf23b68fb0e159537)\n\nIt is hard to gauge the level of hotness that would be unacceptable  to a seventeenth-century European palate. Labat, our principal witness,  frequently complains about the disgusting predilection of local  lower-class settlers for extremely hot foods. He may have been  particularly sensitive. Earlier [accounts of chili peppers](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/04/chilis-in-a-sixteenth-century-garden/)  do not share his dislike, but other European visitors  do occasionally  note that locals eat foods so spicy that recent arrivals cannot stomach  them. Clearly, the macho culture around chili has deep roots in history.\n\nThe *Bataten* or *Potatoes* mentioned here are most  likely sweet potatoes, not Andean potatoes which at this point were not  yet established much outside of their area of origin. Certainly when  Shakespeare refers to *potatoes* in the Merry Wives of Windsor  (Act 5, Scene 5), he means these. Sweet potatoes, especially if they are  not too large (as most modern examples for sale are) can be cooked in a  closed pot in relatively little water and become soft, but not mushy.  That seems to be the consistency the settlers aimed for. I prepared a  small amount as a side dish and therefore cut up one into small slices,  but this is not necessary.\n\nNow, compared to such delights as *boucan de tortue* or even  salt pork with allspice, this is not a showy centerpiece, but it makes  an attractive enough workaday dish that could be prepared with a minimum  of fuss, which must have made it attractive in a society suffering from  a dearth of both tools and labour.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/126pwz8/buccaneer_food_sweet_potatoes_with_pimentade_sauce/", "created_utc": 1680189201.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/126pwz8/buccaneer_food_sweet_potatoes_with_pimentade_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Straub (a server) wanted to try them first (*****chredenzet haben*****),  but he saw such grasping and chasing over the platter that he chose  instead to grab a piece for himself. He was lucky it was the largest,  and how quickly it was gone! Who would have waited for their neighbour  to be served first at this hour? There was no time for that, I should  think. The servers would have cut the fish apart for them, but they (the  guests) could not wait for it. The dish seemed too tempting.  Reuschindhell (lit. rush-into-hell) grasped a particularly slimy head  piece that seemed good to him nonetheless. He thought to himself: \u201cIf  you are gnawing the head, that already means you are too late, but if  you leave it be, you have no enjoyment at all and have come in vain.\u201d  Thus he drew it through his mouth three times and laid it in front of  himself again, as complete as it had been. He was luckier the next time:  He caught a middle piece, and how quickly that was gone!***\n\n***By now, brave Varindwand (lit: break-into-the-wall) had  grasped the head. He thought it did not please his brother, and how  quickly he swallowed it up! And thus he could not live, for the fish  bones (*****gr\u00e4t*****) thrust through his neck! Then spoke Galgenswanch  (lit: swing-on-the-gallows): \u201cDear God, receive our thanks!\u201d Thus  Farindwand\u2019s soul passed away to the land of Cockaigne (*****gen Schl\u00e4uraffen land*****),  that was well suited to him. His body was thrown into the river Necker.  What harm was that to his companions? If you would eat your fill, guard  against having too many fellow diners. But if you would fight  successfully, you must have a good number of friends. Thus also thought  Uotz vom Hag (lit. from the woods). He wanted to take an eater (*****fresser*****)  out of the game and said: \u201cHer Guggoch (lit. Sir Cuckoo) is a man who  can himself make poems about Dietrich von Bern. We would much rather  hear those than sit here eating those dead fish.\u201d***\n\n***Guggoch was flattered and began telling his tale: \u201cSome  heroes sat in a hall, and they ate prodigiously every time\u2026\u201d et cetera,  to the end. But his audience were quick and ate up all the fish before  the singer noticed. When his song was over, Guggoch wanted to start  eating, looked around, and found nothing. He scratched his head and  shouted out: \u201cI am a child (i.e. a fool) and you, Uotz, a right knave!  This trick shows it.\u201d While he had sung joyfully earlier, now he mourned  tearfully, but to all the others, it was a great joke.***\n\nThis episode is so grotesque it stands out even in the context of a  generally outrageous poem. Of course, people actually did die this way. I   doubt it was at all common, but it was also not unheard of (and still  isn\u2019t \u2013 several people choke to death on food every year). The idea that  fellow diners would casually dispose of the body and return to their  feast, though, is as unimaginable to the medieval mind as it is to us.  The point is to illustrate the greed of these peasants.  An important  marker of good manners was never to eat greedily. This is easier if you  don\u2019t need to worry where tomorrow\u2019s dinner comes from, obviously, and  also helped by the certainty that there is enough food for everyone on  the table. Here, that is obviously not the case. This gets even worse in  the next course as food supplies dwindle and the diners get  progressively more confrontational.  \n\nThe  sense of  shortage, incidentally, is very likely realistic.  Fresh fish was a luxury item most people tasted rarely, if at all. There  is every reason to think that most festive tables would have featured  small portions, and since food was served in shared bowls, not \u2018\u00e0 la  Russe\u2019 in individual portions as is the custom today, sharing it out  fairly depended on the restraint of all diners. This is a central  concern of all surviving manners books. The way that people here fight  over food, trick others into forgoing their share, or steal from each  other is the very opposite of this tenet. \n\nAn interesting aside here is the final destination of the deceased diner\u2019s soul: *Schl\u00e4uraffen land*,  the mythical land of Cockaigne. This is obvviously not intended as a   serious theological point, but it shows that the idea of this place was  already so firmly established it could serve as a throwaway punchline.  The still proverbial Schlaraffenland is a kind of worldly paradise, a  realm where food and drink are naturally plentiful and the best can be  had without effort. In a way, it is the perfect afterlife for a glutton.  \n\nHeinrich Wittenwiler\u2018s massive poem \u201aDer Ring\u2018 (the ring) is a  somewhat puzzling piece of literature. Most likely produced in Constance  around 1408-10, it tells a complex story of love, adventure, and deceit  set in a peasant environment exploited for comedy value, but seems to  have a genuine didactic purpose, though one often enough achieved by  satirically describing the very opposite of desired conduct. In this, it  resembles later Grobianic literature. I will limit myself to  translating the parts that are relevant to food and table manners, but  would advise anyone with enough command of German to read it in its  entirety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11xs3sw/how_not_to_eat_fish_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1679428083.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11xs3sw/how_not_to_eat_fish_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Recipes are not found very often,  though. This is an interesting collection, not least because Rumpolt  does [not think highly of dried fish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/13/stockfish-from-the-oeconomia/) in general.\n\nToday, dried flatfish are typically associated with Russian cuisine,  but there is a surviving tradition of preparing them all along the North  and Baltic seas. The most prominent exponent in Germany is [*Dreught Fisch*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreught_Fisch),  a specialty of Finkenwerder near Hamburg. These are now typically small  fish that are eaten uncooked, as a snack, but also used as a cooking  ingredient. Large flatfish are more typically hot-smoked or cooked  fresh.

The  temperatures outside militated for rich and hot foods, so we decided on  fritters. One of them was from the [Rheinfr\u00e4nkisches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rheinfrankisches-Kochbuch.pdf):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnaisutn9eka1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d4bcf41c3eb3cf3c7c490572d9a4002484168ba\n\n***1 If you would make small fritters (kreppelin)  in Lent, take nuts and figs and pound them small with each other and  season it according to your will and heat (it in) oil and fry them  (wrapped) in a leavened (erhabendem) dough in the way of dumpling-style fritters (kreppelin, modern German*** **Krapfen*****) in a pan and serve them cold at the table, those are well-tasting fritters***.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rzgla5q9eka1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8874efdba780b306aec1847068f73328faa791b0\n\nThe filling turned out to be a challenge. The dried figs we had were so  hard and dry they could barely be  cut with a knife, so I ended up  soaking them in hot water before putting them in a blender. Once the\u00fd  were sufficiently mashed, I added a roughly equal amount of walnut meats  and continued processing until they were combined into a paste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yp281ums9eka1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbeac231cb1bfc4df133bad1b81adcd554e90d34\n\nWithout instructions for the seasoning, I opted for a simple mix of  dominant cinnamon with cloves, ginger, and nutmeg. The crust, too, was  simple, a plain water dough leavened with yeast. I made it stiff and  elastic to roll out and wrap around the filling tightly, like pierogi or  ravioli with  Typ 550 flour, a bread flour, and the consistency it  produced was quite pleasant.

And indeed, while turtles \u2013 which are not native to Europe\u2019s  Atlantic shores \u2013 are not mentioned much, both Rumpolt and de Rontzier  have chapters on tortoises. Here is Rumpolt\u2019s:\n\n***There are nine dishes to be made of tortoises***\n\n***1 Take the tortoises, set them to cook in water and add  salt. When they are boiled, take them out asnd cool them. Remove the  shells and dismember them nicely. Pepper, salt, and flour them well and  fry them in hot butter. Serve it dry (i.e. without sauce) thus warm,  with verjuice or fresh juice of sour lemons squeezed over them.***\n\n***2 When the tortoise is dismembered and boiled, take hot  butter, throw it in and fry it. Pepper it and colour it yellow, prepare  it with verjuice and fragrant herbs and let it boil, thus it will be  good and well-tasting.***\n\n***3 Take the tortoises when they are  boiled and cleaned (******ausgebutzt******). Pour pea broth over them, fresh butter, whole peppercorns, mace, and pounded ginge. Also add a little browned flour (*****eyngebrennt Mehl**  ***\u2013 roux?) and parsley root and let it boil together, and also with  green, fragrant herbs. Thus it will be good and well-tasting.***\n\n***4 You can also prepare the tortoises in a sauce (eynmachen) sour and with lemons, be it yellow or white, with pea broth, with verjuice and gooseberries (Agrastwasser und Beer), thus it is also good and well-tasting.***\n\n***5 You can also prepare the tortoises in a pastry and bake  them with lemons or gooseberries once their shells  are removed and  they are dismembered.***\n\n***6 Take the  tortoises, set them to  cook with their  shells and do not let them boil long. Then take them out and cool them.  Take them out of their shells and let the shells stay in one piece on  both sides. Chop a pike small, make a filling with it and fill the  shells with that. Set them to cook with well-tasting pea broth, mace,  and parsley root. And after it has boiled for a while, add  fresh butter  that is unsalted and let them boil with it. Thus it will be good and  well-tasting.***\n\n***7 You can also fill the tortoises with meat on a  meat day.***\n\n***8 Tortoises cooked black with carps\u2019 bloods, be it sweet or sour, season them well.***\n\n***9 Take the tortoises and hollow them out so that the  shell stays together. Chop the meat together with eggs and green herbs,  and add fresh butter. Fill the shells with it and boil them in a broth,  be it sour or sweet, and serve them with the shells on. This is called  filled tortoises.***\n\nThere are not a lot of hot leads here, nothing that screams  Exquemelin or P\u00e8re Labat, but there are certain parallels. Also, recipe  #3 is really kind of a tortoise chowder. We do not eat tortoises in  Germany, I don\u2019t think anyone in Europe still does, but these recipes  make me curious.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11370hi/tortoise_recipes_from_rumpolt_1581/", "created_utc": 1676491207.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/11370hi/tortoise_recipes_from_rumpolt_1581/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Let it boil  slowly (*****gemach*****) that you see it does not curdle completely (*****gehet \u2026 nit gar zusammen*****) like an egg cheese (*****ayr ke\u00df*****). Put it in a small bag and leave it hanging one night, thus it drains (*****zerseyhet*****).  Or place it in a small vat and sew shut the bag so the cheese cannot  come out, lay nice bread on it and a stone above to press it. This way,  the whey comes out. Tilt the vat, then take the cheese and grind it in a  grinding bowl. Add sugar and grind it like a May dish (*****Mayenmu\u00df*****), but it is to be thick like an egg porridge (*****ayr prey*****). If it is too thick, pour on a little rosewater, then it smells of that. It is eaten cold.***\n\nThis is broadly similar to the hard custard that is known as \u201c[fake udder](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/24/hard-custard-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)\u201d in the [Inntalkochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Inntalkochbuch.pdf) [and ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/13/roasted-milk-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[other ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/30/roast-milk-again-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[comparable ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/18/faux-roasted-milk-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[dishes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/04/roasted-milk-of-almonds-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/),  but here, it is not roasted.

Peach stones  contain a kernel that is shaped roughly like an almond, is soft and  pleasantly scented, and contains a significant amount of [amygdalin ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin)that  will break down into cyanide during digestion. Needless to say eating  them is not a good idea. Making this salad will probably not kill you,  but it will almost certainly make you unwell, possibly quite ill.

Salt it.  You may also cut almonds into it. Place it on a plate, turn it over (*****welgern*****)  a little in flour, but do not work the dough too hard, like that for  gewolne kuechlein, as little as you can, thus they are thick. This will  make about eight fritters, each as big and long as a finger. Fry them  floury (*****rein melbig*****) and give them a good heat at the end. Thus they will be quite crisp and good.***\n\nThis recipe is a bit much even for Renaissance Germany, but it makes   sense in a tradition that believed there was no such thing as too much  animal protein.

Then you cook it until it is done in water and wine,  salt it, and lay it in a bowl. Take a ring that is two or three fingers  tall and as wide as the bowl. Set it on the bowl and smear (seal) it  with dough on the outside. Lay the turkey in it. Then prepare a  galantine broth of wine, water, and*** **Bestand** ***that is called isinglass (*****hau\u00dfbletter*****),  sugar, if you wish to have that with it, cardamom, so that it becomes  strong of it, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a little salt. Bring it to the fire  and let it come to a boil. Then pour it over the turkey through a  haircloth so that it stands level with the ring (*****dem ring gleich stehe*****). When it has gelled, take off the ring and stick the galantine with whole almonds every second one (*****ein umb die ander*****) of which should be gilded. You also gild the feet and the the body above and stick it with slivered almonds. Serve it cold.***\n\n***2 Item you carve up turkeys, boil them in water, prepare them in a cauldron coloured brown or yellow (*****macht sie in einem Kessel gelb oder braun ab*****)  or leave them white. Prepare a galantine over them as it described here  and stick it with almonds or small and large raisins etc.***\n\nThis is not a very artful use of clear  jelly, but  certainly  creative. Having it stand higher than the edge of the serving bowl and  stuck all over with almonds would make for an interesting effect, though  it must have been difficult to eat this without making a mess.  Basically, this is  a  larger version of the fashionable stacks of   mousse and jelly we build with steel tart rings. It is interesting that a  word for isinglass was *Bestand*, related to stehen and suggestive of stability and permanence. \n\nFranz de Rontzier, head cook to the bishop of Halberstadt and duke of Braunschweig, published his encyclopaedic *Kunstbuch von mancherley Essen* in 1598. He clearly looks to Marx Rumpolt\u2019s *New Kochbuch*  as the new gold standard, but fails to match it in engaging style or  depth. He is thus overshadowed by the twin peaks of Marx Rumpolt and  Anna Wecker. What makes his work interesting is the way in which he  systematically lists versions of a class of dishes, illustrating the  breadth or a court cook\u2019s repertoire. He is also more modernly  fashionable than Rumpolt. Looking to France rather than Italy and Spain  for inspiration, and some of the dishes he first describes may be  genuine innovations.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10ob499/galantine_of_turkey_1598/", "created_utc": 1675008334.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10ob499/galantine_of_turkey_1598/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Pound the blanched almonds small in a mortar and add a little rosewater  to the almonds so they do not turn oily when they are pounded. Add sugar  and pound it well together, because it turns thin with the sugar and  thus the dough must be made thicker (like that) for snowballs (*****schneepallen*****). Take two flat wafers (*****oblat pletzlein*****)  and stick them together with rosewater as large as you wish to have it.  Place the dough on top and beat it well flat like a plate for bread (*****ein Brotdellerlein*****). After you have beaten the dough broad, it must not be thick, (only) as thick as a finger is across. Bend the wooden hoop (*****reyfflein*****) around it above, put*** **flecklein** ***(literally  small patches?) on it like a peasant apron, and bake it on the oven. Do  not make it too hot so that it becomes nicely yellow. Strew*** **Trisanet** ***on  it. If you would make it with blanched almonds, cut them apart  lengthwise, gild the slices on top and stick the marcipan full of  almonds that are gilded. Thus you have it.***\n\nThis recipe is pretty much the standard way these things were made in  Renaissance Germany; A paste of almonds and sugar spread on wafers that  is decorated in some way \u2013 with a glaze, a moulded and often painted or  gilded top, or, as in this case, decorative additions. These  confections were baked carefully to prevent them from burning. We have  similar instructions from, among other sources,[ Marx Rumpolt](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/) and [Balthasar Staindl](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/03/baked-marcipan-from-balthasar-staindl/). The second recipe is more interesting:\n\n***27 How You Shall Make a*** **Marcipan**\n\n***Take a handful of rice, set it to cook in thick milk, as  thick as can be, let it boil, and when it has boiled, grind it fine in a  grinding bowl (*****Reibscherben*****), as fine as you can. (possible  omission: take almonds) Pour on rosewater, otherwise it will be oily.  When it has been pounded as fine as possible, like for*** **marcipan*****, add it to the boiled rice in the grinding bowl. Grind it well together and add sugar and May butter as though for a*** **Mayen mu\u00df*****. You must not colour it yellow. When you wish to serve it, stick two or four stars (*****sternlein*****) into it and serve it cold.***\n\nNow this one is slightly unusual (and not entirely clear). I think  what it describes is a may or producing mock marcipans that are filled  out with cooked rice and butter. I have not tried this yet and wonder  whether the consistency can be achieved, but it looks like a promising  approach. Of course rice was not exactly cheap, but a handful of rice  certainly cost less than one of blanched almonds. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

Marx Rumpolt actually includes recipes he labels as Turkish:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Turkish light cavalry abducting German women, propaganda print \\(1530\\)](https://preview.redd.it/zs45l70a2y2a1.jpg?width=845&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79ebf406d6bf4a8d65a0f08d79183fcfbc66b410)\n\n ***Turkish Rice. Take rice and wash it, set it by (the fire)  with water and let it swell well. Wash it again and pick it over. Take  blanched almonds, cut them small, and fry them in butter, but so that  they stay white a crisp (*****resch*****). Then throw in the rice and fry  it along with them. Sweeten it with sugar and add black raisins. Serve  it dry and warm at the table. That is how the Turks like to eat it. you  can also serve it in pastries and tarts. (p. CLIII v, chapter on side  dishes)***\n\n***Take mutton that is from the back leg and cut it into  pieces the size of an egg. Then cut onions very small and mix them with  salt. Rub the meat with clean hands. Stick it on a spit and roast it  quickly so that it stays juicy (*****fein im Safft*****). Thus the Turks  prepare their roasts with onions and garlic, it makes strong and healthy  people. It is also a good food for a soldier lying in the field. (p.  LIX r, chapter on Turkish, i.e. fat-tailed, sheep)***\n\n***To marinate a leg in onions. Rub it with onions cut small  and salt. Let it lie over night, stick it on (a spit) and roast it so  that it stays juicy (*****fein im Safft*****). Thus the Turks and Poles like to eat it. (p. XXVII v, chapter in mutton)***\n\n***A lung roast (ox breast) prepared in a different manner:  Salt the roast, spit it and let it roast. Take rice and wash it. Set it  on (the fire) and let it swell. Put it on a strainer again and wash it  cleanly. Place it in a pot or a tinned fish kettle and pour in chicken  or beef broth. If you do not have such broth, take water and fresh  butter. Let it boil with that so that the grains stay whole, and when  you serve the roast, serve the rice and its broth over it and strew it  with sugar confits (*****Driet*****). Thus it will be well-tasting. And thus the Turks like to eat it. (p. V r, chapter on oxen)*** \n\nIt tickles my fancy that Germans enjoyed the exoticism of Turkish  (i.e. Ottoman) foods long before d\u00f6ner kebab became ubiquitous through  the country\u2019s urban areas. Though the number of recipes preserved in our  cookbook sources is small compared to the huge number of those labelled  Italian or Spanish, it is clear that people took an interest, and  likely that it was more substantial than the few mentions suggest. \u201cThe  Turk\u201d, a catchall term that more or less described all Muslims from the  Ottoman Empire, was depicted as a fearsome and cruel enemy in  propaganda, but clearly not seen exclusively as a barbaric other.  Rumnpolt himself came from Hungary and may be speaking from personal  experience when he describes Turkish eating habits, and he certainly  does not disapprove of them. We do well to remember that the Ottomans  were neighbours to the Holry Roman Empire as much as Italy, France, and  Poland were. When Protestant nobles said they would \u201crather be Turkish  than Popish\u201d, they were not engaging in hyperbole, but threatening to  use a real political option. \n\nI am not sure it is significant that Rumpolt\u2019s choice of Turkish  recipes \u2013 rice and spicy, juicy roasted meat \u2013 is very close to the  d\u00f6ner and k\u00f6fte that sell so well in Germany today. Ottoman cuisine was  far more varied than this, and he very likely was aware of the fact.  Interestingly, he notes specifically that the rice should be cooked so  that the grains stayed separate, a habit that would have seemed alien to  contemporary Germans who used it as a porridge cereal.

Pour a little (lacuna. wine? water?) over the gingerbread to cover it  and let it soak overnight, but start soaking it early. Stir it well with  a spoon. The next day, bring it to the fire and let it warm up. Take  half a seidlein of honey in a pan and let it melt over the fire and pour  it in again (?*** **geu\u00df es widerumb an*****). Take wine in a pan with  the honey and let it boil up over the fire and remove the scum. You  shall add three seidlein of wine to the honey, and when it has been  skimmed, pour it into the pot with the gingerbread. Let it warm up well  so the gingerbread becomes soft. Then take a sieve of coarse haircloth  and yet it over a nice cheese vat (*****kaeslein oder multern*****) and  pour the gingerbread into the liquid in the pot (probably garbled). Stir  it in the sieve and force it through so that the gingerbread passes  through. When it has all gone through, wash the pot nicely so that  nothing sticks to it. Take some fresh fat and grease the inside of the  pot. Then return the liquid (*****prue*****) to the pot. When it has been  passed through, it must be like a wheat porridge (in consistency) or  like a thick soup. Then let it boil by the fire and take care that no  fire is close by the pot. Stir it with a spoon so that it does not stick  (*****sich nit anlege*****) when it has become warm again. Take one and a  half quintlein of saffron, grind it up with wine, add it to the liquid  in the pot and stir it with a spoon. Add ground ginger and pepper and  take whole nutmegs and cinnamon bark that is crushed (*****zerknuetschet*****),  but not too small, and also add that to the liquid and keep stirring  the entire time. When it boils, take the ground spices and add them, and  salt it before adding the spices, but not much. Let it boil, and when  it becomes thick, pour in more wine. It must not be too thick or boil  for too long, no longer than an egg that is boiled hard and not poured  out. And it should be slightly thick, like wheat porridge. Thus you have  a*** **Lebersultzen*****.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sixteenth-century drawing of a gingerbread baker standing in his workshop in front of a table with various pieces of decorated gingerbread](https://preview.redd.it/culc2yvtpc2a1.jpg?width=657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c61e3255214b6499dc2f31025a180c5a7cc9ca1)\n\n***13 To make*** **Deller brot** ***or*** **Moerser brot** ***(literally: plate bread or mortar bread)***\n\n***Take grated*** **semmel** ***or old and dry (*****altbackene*****)*** **weck** ***that is well baked, a good part of a*** **wecken** ***of  five or six (pennies), and a little sugar. Put the ground bread in a  bowl. Then add ginger, pepper, cinnamon and saffron. Item do not salt  the eggs too much and beat them well in a pot. Strain it nicely over the  bread so that the shells (*****huelsen*****) come out. Turn over (*****wende*****) the mash (*****mus*****)  top to bottom with a spoon. Take small raisins, the pips removed, into  the bowl with the bread and the egg. Then take almonds, blanch them and  add them entire. Take the greatest quantity of*** **weinberlin** ***(different type of raisins) and stir it together until it is thick as a cheese fritter batter (*****kaeskuechlin teig*****)  and pour on a little egg so that it is not too thick, like filling for  chickens. You shall also use nutmeg to season it. When the batter (read*** **brey** ***for*** **frey*****)  is made, take a small mortar that is glazed on the inside and also  nicely smooth and even outside and that holds about a seidlein. Spread  ashes on the hearth and set the mortar on it so that it stands evenly.  Make a fire that burns brightly and set it by the fire at a distance.  You must not have hot coals beneath. They must be baked by the fire.  Then take fat in a pan and let it boil up very hot. Then pour some into  the dough (*****brenn den eins in taig*****) and stir it well with a  spoon, but do not use too much. Taker the rest of the hot fat and pour  it into the mortar. Swirl it to cover the walls (*****schwenk es fein drinn umb*****) and leave a little in the mortar, but not too full. Than take a cover (*****stuertzlein*****)  that covers it well and lay this into the fire so that it glows. And  when you take it off the fire, throw it briefly into cold water and  place it quickly over the mortar. Do this often, so that it always has a  hot cover. You must not place coals around it or it will stick. Also  turn the mortar and do not leave it alone. When it (the dough inside)  hardens, turn it over, the bottom to the top. It must cook well for two  or three hours before it comes out done. When you think it is well  cooked, take it out. Take a griddle, lay it on entire and lay coals  underneath so that it browns nicely all over. Draw out the fat, then  slice it like apple fritters (*****kuechlein von Apffeln*****). Then lay it into a bowl and pour on the Lebersultz. If it is too thick, take*** **Malvasyer** ***(malmsey wine) and pour it into the Lebersultzen. Take the*** **Tellerbrodt** ***and lay it at the bottom of the bowl, and also take a roast chicken or pigeon. Cut that in half and then lay it on the*** **Tellerbrodt*****, pour the*** **Lebersultzen** ***over it and serve it to eat. But when the*** **Lebersultzen** ***has boiled, it must be thicker than a*** **weinmuss** ***(spoon  dish of wine), and it becomes thicker yet when it stands. You may well  keep that, it lasts half a quarter of a year. When you wish to eat it  later, add Malvasyer or good*** **firnen** ***(?) wine.***\n\n***14 How to bake*** **kuechlein** ***that are round***\n\n***Also add*** **Weinberlin** ***(type of raisin) into the*** **Lebersultzen** ***with a dry (*****altbackenen*****)  weck loaf. Pound that small and fry it and add pounded sugar. Stir it  altogether thoroughly. Take the raisins, a large quantity, and add them  to the bread. Beat eggs and strain them so that the shells (*****huelsen*****)  come out, and pour that over the bread so that it turns nicely thick.  Stir it together with a spoon like cheese fritter batter (*****kaes kuechlein taig*****) and then fry them well. Roll them and turn them over (*****welger wende sie umb*****) so that they become round.***\n\nI am fairly sure all of these recipes are garbled, but there is a  solid core to them that looks like it makes sense. But that is just the  beginning. \n\nRecipe 12 is for a gingerbread-based sauce that is called *Lebersultz*, a \u2018liver sauce\u2019 or \u2018liver galantine\u2019. there are a number of [recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/28/galray-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/)[for ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/28/lung-patties-in-liver-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)[such ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/13/liver-and-onion-sauce-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)[sauces ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/21/another-liver-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/)[surviving](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/27/fieldfares-in-a-liver-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/), but this one does not actually involve liver, and I do not think it is an accidental omission. It may be a sign that the [gingerbread ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/gingerbread-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-2/)[sauces ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/22/pepper-sauces-for-fish-from-cgm-384-ii/)we  still encounter in south Germany today stem from bread-thickened liver  concoctions, with liver leaving the stage much like the mincemeat in  mince pies did. The recipe itself is not always clear and I think some  points were lost in transmission, but it is detailed and clearly tries  to present exhaustive instructions. For one thing, we actually have  guidance to the quantitiy of spices, and it is impressive.  \n\nRecipe 13 looks equally garbled, and is stylistically similar enough  to believe it comes from the same ultimate source even if it was not  logically linked to the previous one. Again, we have the same careful  instructions, not always clear, but trying hard to describe small  details. In  this case, what it described is a [kind](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/29/mortar-cake-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) of [*M\u00f6rserkuchen*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/02/mortar-cakes-from-cod-pal-germ-551/),  an egg and bread dish baked in a greased mortar.  The technique was  familiar a century earlier, and there is no reason to think any  competent cook particularly needed detailed instruction in the 1550s.  still, it is interesting to read how it should be done, and the idea of  using slices of the resulting loaf to serve under chickens in a  gingerbread sauce is interesting, though the whole package sounds a  little starchy. \n\nRecipe 14 is for small fritters, in themselves undistnguished (and  again, garbled), but these, too, are to be served in the same sauce. The  whole is reminiscent of a similar passage in the Kuchenmaistrey where a  number of different things are described as going with the same basic  sauce, in this case one actually involving liver. I am not sure I would  want to try this one for its culinary qualities, but it is interesting  as a way of presenting food and for studying culinary technique. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs aund Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.  Despite its brevity, it is interesting especially as it contains many  recipes for *k\u00fcchlein*, baked or deep-fried confections, that  apparently played a significant role in displaying status.

It it is too thick,  pour in more wine until it becomes like a*** **Weinmus** ***(wine spoon dish) and add sugar. Thus you have a good electuary.***\n\nThis recipe is odd in that it bills itself as being for a pear  electuary, but actually describes how to use it in a porridge.  Electuaries were usually sweetened fruit pastes cooked down to a very  thick consistency to preserve them. The process is well described in a  recipe for cherry electuary from [Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/), and I provided instructions for making a quince electuary in my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook). There is also a more cursory [recipe for pear electuary](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/10/pear-electuary-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/).  Though originally medicinal, these confections had become staples of  the upscale kitchen by the fifteenth century and were used, among other  things, in sauces and mustards. Here, electuary is used in a porridge,  which is quite a luxurious breakfast. The *Regelbirne* identified  as the variant of choice here is a hard, durable pear suitable for  cooking and long storage, probably similar to what was called a warden  pear in England at the time. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs aund Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

Pass a piece  of wood through the center of the grille. Have a proper small vat (*****Schaefflein*****)  made so that the grille can be laid into it. Then boil fish or meat  until they are done. Prepare the broth well with isinglass and season it  with all kinds of spices. Lay this (the grille?) on the fish or meat  and pour on this broth, and set it so that it gels. When it has gelled,  strike the hoops off the vat and take out the galantine carefully. Yet  it into the tube in the bowl, have it gilded nicely, stuck it with  almond kernels and strew it with raisins, and decorate it nicely. Pour  water into the bottom of the bowl and set into it live gobies or  gudgeons or other live fish and serve it.

Making it,  especially without refrigeration, must have been quite challenging. I am  sure it was not made commonly, and having a bowl with a socket mounted  in it just to this end must have represented an extravagance. \n\nIncidentally, while a *Grundel* and a *Kressling* in modern German are different fish, I suspect the original\u2019s *Grundeln oder Kressen* is a reference to the same fish \u2013 most likely the common gudgeon, *gobio gobio* \u2013 that takes account of dialectal variants. \n\nJohann Coler\u2019s *Oeconomia ruralis et domestica* was a popular  book on the topic of managing a wealthy household.

When I had just found a publisher for my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook),  a friend in the SCA joked the only step down in respectability would be  Pirates of the Caribbean. Soon after, left with some time on my hands, I  skimmed [Alexandre Exquemelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Exquemelin)\u2018s [De Americaensche Zee-Rovers](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k114033p.r=Alexandre+Olivier+Exquemelin.langDE)  for food references and was surprised to find quite a few. The project  grew from there, and I am proud to announce that Zauberfeder Verlag has  now commissioned a book on the subject. This sumptuous feast celebrated  the annoucement. \n\n \n\n[Main course](https://preview.redd.it/s4qzm6o59cy91.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa00615a02fffab202d8f61453f4533a3350f722)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dessert](https://preview.redd.it/g2tga6n89cy91.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56433c7dbca5662f909ff2c4bed913764e08e735)\n\nThe complete set of dishes, following a variety of  seventeenth-century writers on the Caribbean, made a profoundly  ahistoric meal of soup, main course, and dessert, but every single dish  is documentable, and all were initial experiments. I will post more  details on some of them in the coming days. For today, my object is the  centerpiece of the dessert course: Guava pie.\n\nThe entire reconstruction is based on a line in [William Dampier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dampier)\u2018s [New Voyage Round the World](https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500461h.html)  (p. 222) in which he states that, along with being boiled in stews  while unripe and poached when ripe, guavas were used to make pie.  Luckily, I was able to find some guavas in reasonable shape during my  shopping (this is not always possible here), so I turned them into a  relatively tame version of a seventeenth-century pie. \n\n \n\n[Pie filling](https://preview.redd.it/j18anv1d9cy91.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=217ec708bcdba84bf5e2daee13a28facce01e745)\n\nThe crust is a basic combination of butter, flour, and eggs, though I  suspect the local version would not have been. I covered the bottom  with grated bread, then layered the sliced guavas alternating with  sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and butter. More adventurous  contemporary recipes sometimes parboil, puree, or fry the fruit, and add  meat, dried fruit, and interesting aromatics, but without any such  evidence, I went with a simple approach and it paid off. \n\nThe filling came out soft and aromatic, with a nice balance of sweet  and tart. The fruit cooked perfectly soft without soaking the crust. The  only minor annoyance were the seeds that crumnched between the teeth  every now and then, but this was not a real problem. I am happy with  this recipe and will definitely do it again to refine it and maybe add a  few contemporary tricks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/ynqy9f/guava_pie_and_buccaneer_cooking/", "created_utc": 1667743959.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/ynqy9f/guava_pie_and_buccaneer_cooking/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Watch [America\u2019s Test Kitchen\u2019s video on rice ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJFU7ezipbg) for more info.)\n2. When the rice is cool enough to handle, mix everything together with black sesame seeds and sesame oil.\n3. Wet your hands and shape these into a thin patty. As glutinous rice is already used, the mixture is already starchy and sticky enough without a rice burger shaper that popular rice burger recipes like to use.\n\nBack in those eras where Ninjas might have existed, polished white rice was more expensive than unpolished (brown) rice. Using brown glutinous rice and brown short-grain rice is technically more historically accurate but then again who made rice burgers back then.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit hard to find brown glutinous rice, so I\u2019m using a 1:1:1 ratio of glutinous:brown:short-grain rice instead. This also has the additional effect of looking prettier with the variation in colour. Sesame seeds and oil are for flavouring purposes, as the burger might not be flavourful enough otherwise.\n\nThe remaining ingredients are workable as a patty as long as adjustments are made so the flavours are actually palatable. Removing the harder to find coix seed, I end up with:\n\n[**IMO PATTY/FILLING**](https://imgur.com/Iv0EzAI)\n\nPer portion:\n\n* 1 Satsuma Imo/Sweet potato, cubed (Yam should work too)\n* About 10 seeds Dried Lotus Seeds\n* A few cm of Ginseng, to taste (optionally cut into small bits)\n* 1/8 tsp Cinnamon, then adjusting to taste\n* Sugar, for seasoning\n* Salt, for seasoning\n\n1. Remove lotus seed stems. If lotus seeds are hard to open, you will have to soften the lotus seeds in water first.\n2. Boil sweet potatoes, lotus seeds and ginseng in salted water until lotus seeds soften and are easily mashable. (should take anywhere 20\\~30 minutes)\n3. Drain the water and roughly mix or mash everything together to desired texture. I left mine chunky for a bit more of a bite.\n4. Add in seasonings to taste. (I omitted sugar altogether, but this depends on tolerance for Ginseng\u2019s bitterness.)\n5. When the mixture is cool enough to handle, wet your hands and roughly form into patties.\n6. It is recommended to deep fry these in a batter, but I didn\u2019t want to use additional ingredients outside of the pill ingredients (plus I was lazy). So just pan-fry them until golden brown on both sides.\n\nWait, wasn\u2019t the filling supposed to be yam and not sweet potato? Well... yes. This was because I made a mistake while researching.\n\n(continued below)"]}

{"title": "History of the Manhattan cocktail", "selftext": "Full disclosure, I wrote this and the link to the original text is [here](https://ramshacklepantry.com/cocktail-perfection-manhattan-cocktail-history/). I am including the enormous wall of text below so you don't have to click on the link to my content if you don't want to. Just thought you all might like it and I had fun doing the research.\n\nEvery named thing has a history of some sort and the Manhattan cocktail is no different. Not only is the Manhattan cocktail history interesting, but also has some pretty incredible connections in its lore. There is some legend and some fact in Manhattan cocktail history and we will look at it all. I would suggest taking a few minutes to mix yourself a Manhattan and then proceed with this read.\n\nThere are two primary legends about Manhattan cocktail history. Not shockingly, both have stories originating in the New York borough of Manhattan. Both have origins around the 1860 \u2013 1880 time period.\n\n**The Manhattan Club and the Manhattan cocktail history**\n\nThe most famous origin story of the Manhattan cocktail originates with a New York private social club aptly named The Manhattan Club. Now, the Manhattan Club was not just the 19th century equivalent of a ravers paradise. The club was created as the Democrat\u2019s political answer to the Union Club, which was founded in conservative ideology.\n\nWhen you think of an ol\u2019 boys club, these kinds of things are literally that. Popular legend has suggested that the Manhattan cocktail history originated during a political event for presidential candidate and NY Governor named Samuel Tilden. And the event origin, but not the location, has really been disproven. I think that this disproven legend is one of the most interesting parts of the lore of Manhattan cocktail history.\n\nThe supposed host of this event, Jennie Jerome, asked for a special cocktail to be made for this event and Dr. Iain Marshall obliged with a drink that was a hit. Soon, thereafter, people started asking for the Manhattan Club drink and the drink they have at the Manhattan.\n\nJennie Jerome also has significant historical importance. Her first husband was Lord Randolph Churchill. They bore two children; one of which would grow up to be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 the British Bulldog himself, Winston Churchill.\n\nFirst, I think it is fascinating that Winston Churchill\u2019s mother was American born. I had not known that. Second, part of the mystique of Winston Churchill\u2019s mystique is closely tied with an over indulgence of spirits. There certainly is some evidence to the contrary, but the witty man is often thought of as an over indulger. This Manhattan cocktail legend is very interesting to me because of the tie of a man known for his drinking and that he is thought to be so directly tied to the invention of such a famous American cocktail.\nIt has been subsequently proven an inaccurate legend, as records show Jennie Jerome to be 8 months pregnant (with Winston) during this event and in Europe. So, while it really is a neat thought that the avid drinker and person of historical importance is somehow related to The Manhattan, it just is not so.\n\nThis does NOT exclude the Manhattan Club origin story, however. According to History of the Manhattan club; a narrative of the activities of half a century , published in 1915, the Mahattan Cocktail was \u201cwas inaugurated at the Club\u201d and not directly attributed to the man, it points to a person named David Gilbert. As far as I can tell, this person was a person who amassed a fortune as a NYSE trader and retired. He then spent a good amount of time involved with the Manhattan Club and apparently working on cocktails.\n\n**William Mulhall theory**\n\nToward the beginning of prohibition, a book was published named Valentine\u2019s Manual of Old New York. In this book they took the account of a man named William F. Mulhall, who was a bartender at a famous cocktail spot named The Hoffman House for many years, starting in 1882. It seems like the purpose of the interview was to get a good description of the bar scene of New York before the government banned spirits.\n\nIn his account, he states:\n\n\u201cThe Manhattan cocktail was invented by a man named Black, who kept a place ten doors below Houston Street on Broadway in the sixties \u2014 probably the most famous mixed drink in the world in its time.\u201d\n\nI like that this account gives a time and place in one of the oldest, largest towns in America. What a great opportunity to look further into the Manhattan cocktail history! With the help of the good people at Reddit\u2019s Ask Historians I found a map of what the likely street addresses were in the 1860s.\n\nGiven these street addresses, Mulhall\u2019s account and some Google Fu, I think I uncovered further clarity to the possibilities of the Manhattan cocktail history. I have gone through and tried to search each of the addresses that may qualify as \u2018ten doors below Houston on Broadway.\u2019 This gets us to between Houston and Prince Street on Broadway.\n\nThis research was a bit trickier than I thought, as there are so many variables. Buildings get torn down. Records are not necessarily easy to find. Multiple businesses could have been at each street address. Mulhall himself was recounting information from decades before. Mulhall himself indicated that the cocktail was created in the 60s.  He did not become a bartender until the 1880s. And who knows, maybe there were lots of pop up, or unregistered, saloons. Finally, I am pretty good at research, but am not a historian. I don\u2019t know what variance in detail and perception that might be skewing my opinion.\n\nSo, based on Mulhall\u2019s account, I have come up with two possible locations where the Manhattan was created.\n\n**Stanwix Hall \u2013 The place where William \u201cThe Butcher\u201d Poole was shot**\n\nFor any of you who are into movies, William Poole was the man who inspired Daniel Day Lewis\u2019 character in the movie The Gangs of New York. Stanwix Hall was the location where Poole was shot and happened to be located at 579 Broadway.  This is right in the vicinity of where Mulhall was describing, below Houston on Broadway.\n\nThe shooting of The Butcher was in 1855, a bit before the 1860s. At least we are getting to the vicinity of the area and possibly individuals who may BE or know who Black is. I found a good New York Times article referenced here that solidifies the location of Stanwix Hall. The article even names people who may have been regulars at that time. There was not any link between the named individuals and the nickname \u2018black.\u2019\n\nThere is some evidence that the building was rebuilt in 1860.  I cannot answer if Stanwix Hall continued to stand through the 1860s.\n\nI think that it may be fair guess that Black was a bartender at Stanwix Hall and the origin of the Manhattan cocktail lies there.\n\n**The Metropolitan Hotel \u2013 Professor Jerry Thomas**\n\nAcross the street from Stanwix Hotel was The Metropolitan Hotel, which occupied street addresses 568 \u2013 592 on Broadway. What is particularly cool about this possible Manhattan cocktail history timeline is that The Metropolitan Hotel has other history in the world of cocktails.\n\nA man named \u201cProfessor\u201d Jerry Thomas was head bartender at The Metropolitan Hotel in the early 1860s. The esteemed \u201cprofessor\u201d published the first mixed drink book in America. The book is called How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant\u2019s Companion.\n\nThere is some controversy about this, he is also known for inventing the famous cocktail, the Tom & Jerry, as well as producing the first written Tom Collins recipe. Who knows, perhaps he employed and managed the man we know as Black.\n\nGiven the history of this location and that it is known for having connections to other cocktail origin stories, I don\u2019t think it is out of line to find the origin of the Manhattan cocktail history at The Metropolitan Hotel.\n\n**Recapping and Summary**\n\nWho would have guessed that the Manhattan cocktail history might have such rich connections in history? I am not sure that I believe any single of the origin stories I have shown more than the next, but this drink did start being mixed somewhere and by someone. It is only fitting that this cocktail royalty has such a storied past. I have given a reasonable amount of information to help you form your own opinion and perhaps narrow possibilities of the Manhattan cocktail history.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/63v4nx/history_of_the_manhattan_cocktail/", "created_utc": 1491506093.0, "score": 9, "author": "cheddarben", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/63v4nx/history_of_the_manhattan_cocktail/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Very interesting!

{"title": "Pancake Dishes (15th c.)", "selftext": "It is just a short post today \u2013 and probably none until Wednesday \u2013 but before I give you two more recipes, a brief note: A [recipe in the Munich Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/26/a-pancake-dish-from-cgm-384-ii/) manuscript (II.13) that I thought described a pancake dish seems to be closely related in wording to [one for fish roe cakes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/12/fish-roe-pancakes-in-roux-sauce/) that survives in Meister Hans and the Dorotheenkloster MS. The former does not mention fish roe and omits the clear instructions on making roux sauce. This may be due to garbling in the transmission process, perhaps a misunderstanding of dictation, and could mean that the roux process was not widely understood at the time.\n\nNow to the recipe for today: The Dorotheenkloster MS has two recipes for one of my favourite side dishes, *kol reys*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2s0zze0rxjje1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=975987c75e23a92331497c1194d11c35f11efb41\n\n***143 Again a kol reis***\n\n***Take eggs, make thin pancakes (pletter) and cut them small. Throw them into milk that is sweet. Take semel bread and stir it in. Mix it with egg yolks and boil it well. Add fat (in einem smalz dorauf \u2013 read mit for in) and serve it.***\n\n***144 Again a kol reis***\n\n***Take eggs, beat them with semel bread flour, and prepare thin pancakes of (those) eggs. Put them into milk and stir it well so they boil. Mix it with egg yolks and also put in fat. Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis is not new or exotic. Recipes for *col ris* show up in the earliest German culinary source, the [Buoch von guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (#65-67) from where they[ migrated to Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/05/pancake-mus/), another Austrian source with many parallels to the Dorotheenkloster MS. Notably, while the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) retains all three of the original recipes, they feature under different names (one of them clearly misplaced). Meanwhile, the Dorotheenkloster MS only retains two, but gives them their original name. Since these two, paralleling #65 and #66 in the *Buoch von guoter Spise*, are followed by a recipe for quince puree that parallels #68, the omission appears to have been intentional. Interestingly, there are also [two recipes for ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[*kolreys*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) in the [Nuremberg-made Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf) that broadly parallel #65 and #66 in the Buoch von guoter Spise, but unlike here, the distinction of making the dish with or without bread cubes is lost. They are included in both cases.\n\nThe dish itself is simple and attractive. Here, we learn that the \u2018sheets\u2019 of eggs involve flour so we are talking about what we recognise as pancakes. Our instinct is to make this a sweet dish, but it really does not have to be \u2013 it works well as a savoury side dish. In the fifteenth century, sweetness had not been cordoned off in the dessert course yet anyway, so even sweetened, this could have featured in a main course. But above all, these parallels tell us how cookbooks were taken apart and reassembled, copied by dictation and possibly from memory in the German tradition.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n [https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/16/two-more-kol-reys-recipes/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/16/two-more-kol-reys-recipes/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ir05n3/pancake_dishes_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739733806.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ir05n3/pancake_dishes_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

As to what sauce to serve with it, I assume [a raisin sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/03/pepper-sauce-for-fish-from-the-inntalkochbuch/) might do well, but there are no indications in the text.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Here they are side by side:\n\n[An egg white and sugar crust similar to the one in this recipe atop an almond tart based on a 1598 recipe](https://preview.redd.it/7vjub24z042e1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4da544be9c4d5e59dee4e36211f5db4c1d57a80)\n\n***240 How to make good tarts in several ways***\n\n***To make white tarts***\n\n***Firstly, you must take a Seutel (liquid measure and drinking vessel), as the Seutln are customary in this country) of the whites of eggs, one Seutel of sugar, half a Libertzen (pound) of good almonds that are most carefully and finely pounded, and also a Seutel of good milk. Pass the prepared ingredients through a sieve all together with the milk. Then make a dough of flour, sugar, and rosewater. Grease the pan with fat beforehand to prevent it burning. Make the dough as thin as paper, lay it over the pan, and place the tart or rather the abovementioned ingredients on it. Put an edge (Reuffelin) on it above all sprinkle rosewater on the tart. Beaten egg white is spread on it with a small feather, and finally sugar is sprinkled on, never stint the latter. Cover the pan and the tart diligently with a covering (\u00fcberleg) and set coals above it as is needed. That way, the rosewater, egg white, and sugar will harden and draw together like a crust and the tart will be as good as marzipan.***\n\n***241 To make another white tart***\n\n***At the beginning, take a Putschen (pitcher) of good milk, the best that can be had, add rice according to the size and occasion of the tart, and cook the two together. But see the rice does not cook too dry. Then take a seutel of egg whites, one of sugar, and one pound of good almonds, and no more milk that is needed to pass the abovementioned ingredients through a sieve. If you make this kind of tart with a dough and edge made with rosewater, egg whites, and sugar prepared and finished exactly as is described above and above all do not stint the sugar, it will be a good tart.***\n\nDespite being quite similar in many respects, these tarts would produce a very different texture and eating experience. The fact they are both given the same name suggests that the \u201cwhite\u201d tart was a broad class. It is possible that the egg white custard of the first recipe is the \u2018original\u2019 while the rice filling of the second represents a way of making economies, though at a high level. I think it is more likely that they are variations on a theme. Like a modern hamburger or pancake, a \u2018white tart\u2019 could be many things.\n\nBoth recipes are detailed, but not easy to reconstruct with full confidence. Among the things I do not know is the quantity of a *Seutel* or a *Putschen*. The seidel is usually a drinking vessel, so we are not looking at very large containers, the *Putschen* a vessel for serving drinks to pour out at the table, thus likely to be larger. It seems likely to me that neither refers to a formal measure. We also do not know which pound measure the recipe refers to, though that is less problematic given the variety was not extreme.\n\nAs to the crust, we know almost nothing about it. The dough involves rosewater and a thin base of just flour and rosewater, like phyllo dough, is possible. It certainly cannot have been a short crust given it is meant to be rolled out thin \u2018as paper\u2019 (which even using sixteenth-century linen paper as a basis of comparison would be quite thin). The top layer is interesting in its own light; It sounds like an ancestral form of meringue. The sugar, egg whites, and rosewater are all supposed to be spread separately and fused during baking. [Similar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/) sixteenth-century recipes give instructions to mix sugar and egg whites before baking, though, and they are likely of one family.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gvy91k/another_white_tart_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1732131789.0, "score": 4, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1gvy91k/another_white_tart_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Since I am likely to be quite busy in the lead-up to Halloween, I will be posting them this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/doayoihu0kxd1.jpg?width=2937&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45672a6fd80c0d2447d1da46182c84e5d066208b\n\n***218 Hereafter follow soups, and first, how to make cream soup***\n\n***Take cream and boil it like a milk soup. Beat 3 or 4 egg yolks well, and when the soup is boiling and you are about to serve it, pour in the yolks. Let it boil no more, just stir it. Cut a semel loaf into cubes and fry it in fat. Serve the soup over that and salt it lightly.***\n\nThis is a simple recipe, but [soups](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/05/soups-from-the-tegernsee-list/) are meant to be simple dishes. The basic principle is a hot liquid \u2013 often just broth from a cauldron used for most cooking \u2013 that is spooned over bread to soften it. Of course in the Welser household, even a simple dish is elevated by pricey ingredients and great care. This one uses cream instead of the plain milk that would be more common, is thickened with egg yolks, not whole eggs, and served over the finest white bread \u2013 semel \u2013 fried in fat rather than dry, hard bread. However, the basic principle is universal; This is how soup is made. It is very rich, but no doubt would be welcome after a day of travel on horseback or working in the garden.

Add a little lye to the water, that way it turns nicely green. Pour it onto a colander and drain the water off it, but do not press it out or you will crush the little heads (kepfla). Then you put the little heads into a pot and add good meat broth that is fat. Pour on good hot fat (schmaltz) and add pepper. Set it on the coals and let it steam, and when you serve it, put fat (faystin) on it.***\n\nThis is frequently cited as the first evidence of what we call Brussels sprouts today, small, compact sprouts of the cabbage plant. The manner of preparing them has not changed very much, though we may prefer them with a little less added fat these days, and the resulting dish is quite attractive. I have made it with modern sprouts for feasts and it was always popular.\n\nBy way of modernisation, I recommend using baking soda in place of lye. Adding a little to the initial cooking water helps preserve the colour. The sprouts must be handled with care as they are drained and transferred to a second pot \u2013 a slotted spoon works well \u2013 and they should be cooked gently, with a small amount of broth. Adding hot fat is not necessary in my opinion, but it adds a measure of maillard flavours in contact with the dry sprouts, so if you are aiming for authenticity, you should drizzle on some directly from a hot pan. Cooking the sprouts in a closed pot \u2013 the definition of steaming (*dempfen*) in the sixteenth century \u2013 infuses them with the flavbour of the broth and pepper. A little butter melted over them as they are served makes a good addition, though if you already added extra fat during cooking, it may be too much of a good thing. The original intent, going by the word *faystin*, may be fat rendered in cooking meat that would be collected for use in a well-run kitchen.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1g8w0te/cooking_dried_soles_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1729533149.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1g8w0te/cooking_dried_soles_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Close it well with a cloth so the steam stays in it and thus let it steam (*****dampfen*****) until they turn soft. Then grind them well in a grinding mill (*****reybstain*****) until they are neat and smooth. Then pass them through a colander or sieve. Take it and prepare it with good meat broth, but do not make it too thin because it becomes thinner as it boils. Boil it well, and then take fresh bacon and boil that. When it is boiled, cut it into small cubes, but do not cut it through (*****schneyt in nit nach*****) so it all stays together. Lay it in hot fat and turn it over rightaway, and take it out quickly. Then lay it in the middle of the bowl in which you serve the peas.***\n\nThere are several [recipes for mashed peas identified as Bohemian](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/29/all-about-peas-part-one/). A [recipe in the *Buoch von guoter Spise*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/10/infidel-peas-an-odd-recipe/) (not involving actual peas) is identified as both Bohemian and infidel peas. It is not clear what, if anything, made these dishes specifically Bohemian, but it may have been the very fine consistency of the mash.\n\nIn this recipe, the peas are ground in a mill and then diluted with meat broth, which would have consisted a smooth and almost liquid dish. This is nonetheless not really very exciting. The interesting part of this recipe is the trimmings: a chequerboard piece of bacon. A solid piece most likely of pork belly, parboiled, cut in a chequerboard pattern, and quickly flash-fried to crisp the outside must have been visually arresting at the centre of a bowl of mashed peas. I don\u2019t know whether it can be made tender enough to detach individual squares and eat them, but it would be a very interesting and fun effect.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

foods, Ekkehart delivers specific blessings for a wide variety of beverages, but wine clearly gets top billing. That is not surprising, given it is both the preferred drink in the classical Roman tradition and important in Christian ritual. The author uses a great deal of poetic circumlocution to describe it as well as drawing on some classical Latin terminology. There is, for example, a reference to Falernian wine in #232. This wine from Campania was prized in the Roman Empire for its flavour and the fact that it aged well. The best kind could be kept for decades. It is highly unlikely that the monks of St Gall actually drank Falernian, but the word may well refer to a wine of similar qualities, or just a particularly good one. In #250, we find *passum*, which was a particularly sweet and flavourful wine made from grapes that were partly dried on the vine to concentrate their sugar and flavour. How similar to the Roman drink whatever Ekkehart called by this name was in unknown. It may already have been made using fruit affected by *Botyris cinerea* or \u2018noble rot\u2019, but we cannot be sure of this. It is tempting to think that Ekkerhart already savoured a *Trockenbeerenauslese*, though.\n\nIn #237, Ekkehart makes a reference to Greco-Roman gods. This is very likely no more than a classical allusion to noisy drunkenness, something monks were expected to avoid decorously; Bromius, the roaring or thundering one, is a byname of Dionysos, hence Bacchus, so it is the same deity. A classically educated person would know this. I cannot exclude the possibility that he actually thought of Bacchgus as a real entity the same way Satan is real to him, but I suspect rather not.\n\nBeyond wine, we have several references to mustum. In classical Latin, this refers to freshly pressed juice as well as young wine still in fermentation. Since it is contrasted with old wine in #240, the latter is the likelier interpretation. Today, the German word *Most* often refers to apple or pear wines, but here it is clearly grape wine. We also learn that at least some of the mustum was light-coloured. *Niveo* in #238 literally means snow-coloured, so this is probably something like Federwei\u00dfer.\n\nAs we go beyond grape wine, we find a variety of other beverages addressed briefly. There is *savinatum*, most likely a wine flavoured with juniper, and *sicera*. Originally a Biblical term referring to an unknown alcoholic beverage, *sicera* it is often used to refer to cider and perry, as is the case here, and eventually takes on that meaning exclusively. Mulberry wine (elsewhere refrred to as *moratum*) and mead (*medo*) are mentioned, as are *cer(e)vise*, beer, and *mulsum*, which is most likeky a honey-sweetened wine.\n\nTowards the end, Ekkehart turns to praising water. This is what you would expect of a monk who was supposed to live abstemiously and eschew drunkenness (except \u2013 see #242 \u2013 the drunkenness of intense religious experience). I am not entirely convinced of his sincerity here, but what is more interesting is that he makes no reference to the classical habit of mixing wine with water. This was universal in the Greco-Roman world, but seems entirely unfamiliar to him.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057. They are a collection of blessings to be spoken over food. Written in short rhyming couplets in Latin, they are unusual in their attention to the diversity of foods and preparations. This is not a serious work of theology or medicine, but an intellectual diversion, playful verse meant to show off a broad vocabulary and facility with Latin. That is what makes them very valuable \u2013 they give us a glimpse of the mental horizon of a senior cleric of the 11th century at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1fbfr8f/blessings_for_drinks_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1725739208.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1fbfr8f/blessings_for_drinks_11th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Here, it is combined with almonds, sugar, and rosewater for the typical luxury flavour of the age. We also have relatively clear quantities: one pound of butter, three quarters of a pound of almonds and one quarter pound of sugar.

However, in the context of the imperial church, senior monks often held high offices and governed territories. They were integrated into its upper class and took part in its festivities. That likely explains the room the *Benedictiones* allow such fare.\n\nThe game animals listed here are broadly what you would expect. The bear, still common in Central Europe\u2019s forests, and the wild boar were dangerous game, hunted not least to show off martial skill. Deer were less so, but hunting them called for skill, coordinated action, and endurance. The text mentions *cervus* (#121 and 122) and further down *damma* (#127), *capreus* (#128 and 129), and *capreolus (#130)*. These likely are the European red deer and roe deer respectively, with *cervus* being the buck, *damma* the hind, *capreus* the adult roe deer and *capreolus* a juvenile. The word is used to designate the species today while *capreus* classically means a goat, but there are no wild goats in Central Europe and *capreus* often means a roe deer in Middle Latin.\n\nThere are three mentions of wild bovines: *vesons* (#123), *urus* (#124), and *bos silvanus* (#125). The first is the European bison or *wisent* (*Bison bonasus*), the second the aurochs (*Bos primigenius*), both still found in much of Central Europe then. Both were very dangerous animals and provided impressive horns along with their meat. It is not clear what the *bos silvanus* is, though. It may be a synonym for either of the other two \u2013 more likely the *wisent* as it lives in forests. However, domestic cattle will go feral quite enthusiastically if allowed, and it is not implausible that there were some around in the less populated corners of Germany.\n\nBlessing #126 has become famous because it is so unexpected. Horse meat, after all, was the only meat [forbidden by papal decree](https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/having-friends-for-dinner/) since 732 and eating horses was considered the height of barbarism. It appears, though, that from fairly early on, wild horses were exempt from this prohibition.\n\nWe then find the chamois and ibex mentioned, both found in the Alpine regions around St Gall specifically. Finally, the list concludes with the hare and marmot. Especially the latter is somewhat out of place. While most of the list would demonstrate the prowess and courage of aristocratic hunters and hares, at least, are fast enough to require marksmanship, marmots are not so much hunted as mined. People dug them up from their burrows while the animals hibernated. Their meat was prized for the thick layer of fat that they developed during autumn, and that is exactly the quality blessing #134 lists.\n\nThere is very little to say about preparation here, unfortunately. It is likely that fresh game would be cooked quickly and simply, roasted or boiled, but we cannot be certain about this. Later recipe collections also mention preserved venison and sausages and black puddings made from game. Here, we learn that a crustamina is made of deer (#122). As I [explained earlier](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/01/blessings-for-meat/) (see #104) it is not fully clear what *crustamina* is, but a roast is not an implausible reading. Chamois, we find (#132), is either roasted/fried (*assare* can mean both) or boiled.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057.

As we have seen, the term could stretch to something much [like modern Maultaschen](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/06/29/herb-krapfen-maultaschen-ancestry/) or [cheese hand pies](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/07/13/cheese-pockets/), but the typical kind \u2013 usually designated in the diminutive *krepfla* \u2013 is a small fritter with a filling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkgh0h0ms4dd1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f98ca09394002b123535c5f219fcee3c50d9726\n\n***124 If you want to fry*** **krepfla**\n\n***Take boiled crawfish and chop them small.

Then take onions and green herbs and chop them small. Take pepper and ginger and a little juniper berries, stir it all together, and pour in hot fat. Take sugar water (sugar and water?), prepare a dough and wrap this filling in it. You can also fry these in cool fat or serve them in a cooking sauce and boil them, (and) serve good good (repetition in original) wine and sugar with the sauce.***\n\n***126 If you want to fry almond*** **krepfla**\n\n***Take almonds and grind them small and then add sugar to them, as (much as) you do for a white fritter. Then prepare a dough with eggs and roll it out as thinly as possible. Then put the abovementioned filling (*****dayg*****) into it nice and small, cut it around with a pastry wheel (*****redles*****), and fry it nicely and slowly in fat.

Take 3 eggs and good green herbs, and small raisins. Stir it all together and spice it as best you can. Colour it yellow, and (prepare) sheets with eggs and wrap it in them. Fry them or boil them.

Thus they will be good.***\n\nBetween fish and crawfish, liver, custard, and marzipan, this is a good cross section of what people put in krapfen. Of course there is a good deal more out there, recipes including[ bacon and cheese](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/03/cheese-bacon-fritters/), [apples, nuts and raisins](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/07/three-krapfen-fillings/), and of course [chicken](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/16/poultry-krapfen-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/).

Then take the caul and wrap the chopped liver in it. Beforehand, make it spicy with pepper, ginger, and raisins. Lay it in a pan and have a good part of fat in there. Set it on the floor (of the fireplace) on a griddle and put a small amount of embers underneath. When it is brown underneath, turn it over carefully so it doesn\u2019t break and also let it fry in the other spot.***\n\nSimilar recipes show up in [many ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/22/a-stuffed-liver-roasted-in-a-caul-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[fifteenth ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/16/liver-wrapped-in-caul-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)[century ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/12/liver-roasted-in-caul-from-meister-eberhard/)[sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/05/liver-in-a-caul-from-cgm-384-ii/), which means it is an establisahed tradition by the 1550s. We also find it later, not least [in the Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/15/another-liver-in-a-caul-recipe/) that comes from Augsburg originally. Clearly, the tradition was alive. The version that Philippine Welser preserves is interesting in that it is fried while the others are roasted. I suspect that it is meant to go on the grill after frying on all sides to make sure it cooks through, but it could equally be finished in a slow pan.\n\nIt is unclear whether the liver is pre-cooked or not. The recipe doies not mention it, and it is possible to use uncooked liver for some sausage recipes, but I suspect that it was cooked. Raw liver, if chopped finely, turns almost liquid and would require a lot of breadcrumbs before it developed a consistency fit to wrap in a caul. More importantly yet, many of the other surviving recipes specify boiling the liver first. If they are of a tradition \u2013 as I think they are \u2013 that degree of difference would be improbable.\n\nI am not convinced by the combination of sage, parsley, pepper, ginger, and raisins for a liver sausage analogue, but I have been wrong before.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

For example, in #8 and 9 it t is not clear what exactly made a *torta* different from a regular bread loaf. The likeliest explanation is that *tortae* were enriched with ingredients like oil, fat, milk, cheese, or egg while *panis* was plain bread. Thus, this blessing would be for breads served on special occasions.\n\nAs with the *torta*, it is likely the moon-shaped bread in #10 was made with specific ingredients and had a distinctive texture and taste we cannot really reconstruct. The shape most likely was that of the crescent moon, not the full, since the latter would be circular, like any other loaf. The *panis elixum*, boiled bread, of #11 is something we encounter with some regularity and usually with little or no explanation. I believe it refers to bread that is immersed in boiling water before being baked like modern bagels or *Brezeln*. That practice is attested in later centuries, and such breads were popular as festive treats. However, it is also possible this literally means bread dough that is boiled until it is fully done. Such leavened dumplings, too, are attested later, though they were not popular in Germany as far as I can tell. Meanbwhile, #12 *(Panis) frixum* refers to pan-frying. This could be pancakes, though I think it is more likely a kind of flatbread, perhaps salted like a cracker.\n\nThe practice of leavening bread with (presumably beaten) egg mentioned in #13 is interesting. It may be specific to feast day breads, as may the yeast leavening mentioned in #14. The *faex* referred to is most likely beer yeast, a byproduct of brewing that was used to leaven bread from at least the first century CE. Later sources suggest yeast was favoured for finer, lighter breads made with more finely bolted flour while sourdough was used on everyday bread. That may well be what entry #15 refers to. Strictly, *fermentatum* just means fermented, but in the context of baking, it usually means sourdough cultures perpetuated by bakers. This was usually not done systematically, but through established procedure in which the same implements were used and pieces of \u2018old\u2019 dough \u2018fed\u2019 to new batches.\n\nThe *oblata* mentioned in #16 etymologically is something that is offered up, I this case to God, and thus would originally have referred to communion bread. However, the word later comes to mean the type of unleavened wafer used in that role rather than the consecrated host specifically, and very likely already does so in this case. It is, after all, a blessing for the table, not the altar, and it would be highly irregular to say Mass in the refectory. Meanwhile, #17\u2019s *Azimum* or *azymum* is the word used in the Latin Vulgate Bible for the unleavened bread prepared for Passover. This is very likely a special kind of bread prepared for Easter celebrations, maybe similar to *matzohs* and not a regular food item.\n\nThe text then lists blessings for breads made with different grains: spelt, wheat, rye, barley, and oats. It is not clear whether these are made entirely of one grain, or with an admixture to a base of wheat or rye. Barley and oats are not well suited to making leavened loaves, so if they were made entirely with one grain, these two must have been flatbreads. The list mirrors similar enumerations in other contexts, so it is likely this describes the basic bread options of the time, but we should keep in mind that reghional practices could be very narrow and not every grain available everywhere.\n\nThe *pestis* warded against in # 19 and 21 means evil in the sense of some harmful outside event, but not yet specifically a plague as it will come to do later. Similarly, the fraud referenced in #26 is an attribute of the devil (the enemy), not connected to any concrete dishonest business practice by bakers.\n\nIn #28, the bread described is baked *sub cineris*, literally under the embers. This may well be the kind of simple ashcake that King Alfred is supposed to have burned. However, a well-appointed kitchen would have been able to provide stone or ceramic plates to place in the embers and perhaps even a cloche to cover the loaves. This method was known as *sub testudo* in Latin, but since it is not referred to elsewhere, that may also be meant here.\n\nThe whole list is a fascinating read and runs to over 200 entries for different foods, so I have a lot of work left.

Make it as a dough for hares\u2019 ears (hasen nerla) that is well rolled out, Cut off a piece and roll it out lengthwise about as long as a spindle and make it (cut it) so that it resembles an antler with its points. Then let it fry nicely and properly in fat. When you want to serve it, you should always set two and two opposed to each other in the bowl and sprinkle them with sugar.***\n\nThis is basically a \u2018short\u2019 cookie, though the fat is introduced by frying instead of being added to the dough. This is familiar from other recipes, among others the [common manner of making pastries in greased pans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/19/baking-pastries-the-italian-way/). In one recipe from Northern Germany, we also find a sheet of such dough [spread with butter before baking](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/12/continuity-and-change-in-sheet-cake/). These are ancestory to the plethora of German Pl\u00e4tzchen and Kekse of today, and [a parallel recipe from 1598 refers to a variety of shapes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/23/renaissance-nibbles-for-a-pity-party-ii/) beyond the antler.\n\nThese antlers must have been pleasant \u2013 sweet, rich, warm, elegant. Arranged in pairs to look like a set of antlers laid out after the hunt, they must also have looked the part on a well-set banqueting table. There is, obviously, always the option of adding some butter and baking rather than frying them if you prefer a more modern approach. As fresh fritters, they are especially delicious, but do not keep well.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1dc17f9/antlershaped_fritters_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1717959450.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1dc17f9/antlershaped_fritters_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Carp in Pastry (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/07/carp-in-pastry/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/07/carp-in-pastry/)\n\nA recipe in two variations that I may try come winter, from Philippine Welser\u2019s recipe collection.\n\n***79 If you want to make a fish pastry***\n\n***Take a fish, be it a carp or another kind, scale it and next cut it through up and down on both sides (make cuts along the sides?). Open its belly and take out the gall. They take spices as are*** [***written in the first capon pastry***](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/10/capon-pastries/)***, but with a fish, you must use more salt than with meat. You must look to that because fish are sweeter. Then take the fish and season it first under the fins. Then remove the innards and season it well inside. Also season the innards and return them into the fish. Then rub the fish with spices on both sides and see that it is well salted in the cuts you made. Then lay it on the dough which must be*** [***made as though for venison pastry***](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/23/two-more-pastry-crust-recipes/)***. (Have) two parts and fold one over it. But beforehand, lay fat worth 4 batzen (a small coin) and close it. Shape it like a fish and stick in a small tube (rerlin \u2013 cinnamon stick?) on top so you can pour in a sauce and let it bake for 2 hours.***\n\n***80 A pastry of cut-up fish***\n\n***Take the fish and cut it. Then make it into pieces as though you wanted to boil it. Then make a round pastry crust from the dough and sprinkle spices on the bottom as described in the first (recipe), but stir in more salt or otherwise salt the fish more strongly. Lay the fish into the pastry and sprinkle on spices and salt and put two good pieces of fat on top. Close it and brush the pastry with egg, and let it bake properly. When it has baked for an hour, take the white of an egg and good wine, beat it well together, make a hole at the wreath (ain krentzlin \u2013 at the edge of the top crust?) and pour in this sauce (brie) with a small funnel. Then let it bake well. You shall treat all fish pastry this way, with the sauce.***\n\nThis recipe is interesting and very different from the way fish are usually cooked. Carp, of course, have a strong flavour that can take the rather strong spicing with ginger, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon recommended here. The whole fish would be enclosed in a pastry following its natural outline and no doubt aretfully decorated. Once the fish is fully cooked, it should be possible to detach the top crust and flake it off the bones, seasoned and juicy, though I am not sure how I feel about leaving in the innards. They may be meant to add flavour, or to be eaten on their own. The pastry of fish pieces would be opened at the top to remove individual ready portions, a convenience for serving.\n\nNote the relatively large amount of fat added to both pastries; A batzen, while not a large sum, is a sixteenth of a guilder which is not insignificant. Estimating how much fat this would buy is hard since prices fluctuated seasonally, but it is more than most families coiuld comfortably have afforded on a daily basis. Another question is the tube that is inserted into the fish pastry. The word *rerlin* used to describe it is normally used for cinnamon, and it may well have been a cinnamon stick. It would certainly be another instance of conspicuous consumption.\n\nFinally, this recipe contains two cross-references (to venison and capon pastry) connecting it with other recipes in the collection. Clearly, there is a plan of some sort in evidence and unlike in many fifteenth-century sources, these references lead somewhere (see the links in the recipe text).\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

{"title": "Meat Pastries (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/01/more-on-meat-pastries/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/04/01/more-on-meat-pastries/)\n\n I am badly in arrears and promise to write up what I did over the Easter  weekend, but there are still recipes and experiences from the Palm  Sunday open. The main course of our meal that day were two meat pastries  from the recipe collection of Philippine Welser. I used the opportunity  to try the [pastry crust recipe she suggests](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/23/two-more-pastry-crust-recipes/). \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtn5p9mi3xrc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c5f9d56600a9b8ece9c896719e6d125c2109311\n\n***58 How you should make pastry coffins (*****bastetten hefen*****)***\n\n***Take half fine flour and half second flour (*****nach mel*****,  flour of lesser quality), break 2 eggs into it and put in melted fat  into it, about as much as the size of one egg, and hot water. Or boil  the fat in the water and once the water has cooled a little, pour it  into the flour. Work it well until it is dry and elastic, otherwise it  cannot be raised (*****auf setzenn*****). Except for venison pastries, I  only use fine flour alone, and when it has had enough, I pull it, thus  it becomes good and elastic.***\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xesen7ak3xrc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b810dcd44325d8bbf136d70c358535e1913a714b\n\nI went with the proportions that had already worked for a tart shell  made on a similar principle: Four cups of flour (two each Typ 550 and  Typ 1050), 75 grammes of fat, two eggs and one cup of hot water. Though I  had expected to need more liquid, I didn\u2019t. The crust turned out  pleasant to work and roll out as well as tasty, though not as \u2018short\u2019 as  I would have liked. More fat would most likely remedy that. The pastry  recipes we served were one chicken and one venison, though we had to  settle for substituting lean stewing beef. \n\n***60 If you want to make a capon pastry***\n\n***Make the pastry crust as you know and take the capon and  clean it well. Parboil it a little, but not long. Then take it and chop  off its neck and its feet. If you want, carve it up, but not all the way  through, and season it well with pepper, ginger, not much mace, and a  little cloves and cinnamon. Put it into the pastry crust together with  the neck and the feet, and add the yolks of hard-boiled eggs and  raisins. Take capon fat or marrow and also put it in, and put the  leftover spices on top. Add sugar, and do not forget the salt. Close it  and let it bake slowly, and brush it well with egg all around.***\n\nOf course, capons are rather difficult to find these days, but modern  broiling chickens are competitive in terms of tenderness and fatness. I  considered using an entire bird (as I [had done before](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/20/birthday-chicken/)),  but decided to go with legs instead to ease portioning. A dearth of  pastry moulds and an unwarranted concern over the watertightness of the  crust made me opt for a loaf pan to hold it. I rubbed the thighs and  drumsticks with the spices, layered them in the case, put raisins, fat,  and boiled egg yolks on top and closed the whole thing to bake it at  180\u00b0C. The result was beautifully tender, spicy, slightly sweet chicken,  an interesting flavour combination that I am happy to repeat. I think  actually using this on an entire bird, pre-carved to come part easily at  the joints, would make a nice conceit for serving. Someone more  talented at sculpture than me will also be able to produce a pretty  crust. \n\nThe other recipe called for venison: \n\n***66 Further to make a venison pastry; I think this is better than the above***\n\n***Take the venison and boil it in water for an hour. Then  let it cool. Cut long (strips of) bacon and take spices like pepper,  ginger, and a little cloves , and salt; use much pepper, stir it all  together, and coat (lit. roll) the bacon in it. Lard the venison well  with this, and what bacon you have left over, lay (in the pastry crust)  with the venison. Take the leftover spices and sprinkle it all over the  venison. Make a kneaded (*****uber schlagenn*****) dough for it with only flour of second quality. Poke 5 holes in the top and let it bake for 4 hours.***\n\nThis turned into mere proof of concept for the spicing. The stewing  beef we had was cut too small to lard properly, so I layered it with the  spiced bacon instead. The filling fused into a solid mass which was  difficult to serve out, but it tasted excellent and most likely would be  even better in the original configuration. \n\nThe crust was very well-behaved and practical. It rolled out well,  unmoulded without trouble, and held liquid wherever I didn\u2019t flub the  closing. I suspect it would work well with more ambitious shapes and  moulds, maybe an Easter Lamb or something similar.  \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

Except for venison pastries, I  only use fine flour alone, and when it has had enough, I pull it, thus  it becomes good and elastic.***\n\n***How to make the dough for tarts (dortten)***\n\n***Take fine flour, an egg or two, a little water, and a  spoonful of fat. Beat it well together and sprinkle on flour until until  it turns as thick as semel dough. Then work it well under your hands until it turns dry and make a tart base that is quite thin with a wreath around it.***\n\nUnsurprisingly, these recipes closely parallel that recorded in the recipebook of Sabina Welser:\n\n***To make a pastry dough for all raised pastries***\n\n***Take flour, the best you can get, about two handfuls, or  depending on how large or small you want it, place it on the table, stir  in two eggs with a knife and salt it a little. Put water and an amount  of lard the size of two good eggs into a pan and let it melt together  and boil, then pour it onto the abovementioned flour on the table, make a  stiff dough and work it well as you see fit. In summer, you must use  meat broth instead of the water and fat ladled from the top of soups  instead of lard. When the dough is kneaded, roll it into a round ball  and stretch it out well forward with your fingers or with a rolling pin,  so that a rim remains, and then let it harden in the cold. Then shape  the dough in the measure I showed you and retain some dough for a cover,  roll it out and moisten it and the top of the the raised pastry with  water, then press it well together with your fingers. Leave a little  hole in one place, and when it is pressed together well and no openings  are left, blow into the little hole you left so the lid rises up nicely.  Then press it together immediately. Put it in the oven, but flour the  container beforehand and see that the oven is heated well, thus it will  be a good pastry. That is the way you make dough for raised pastries.***\n\n***(Sabina Welserin #61, translation by Valoise Armstrong)***\n\nBeyond the fact that these recipes come from the same place  (Augsburg) and time (early 1550s), they even have a connection with the  same family. We do not know exactly how Sabina and Philippine Welser  were related, but they were both members of the Welser baking clan. It  is entirely plausible that their recipe books reflect the practices the  same kitchen and its staff. No matter what nineteenth-century historians  liked to imagine, we should not envision a Welser woman working in the  kitchen herself. \n\nThat gives me a greater level of confidence to draw on them to better  understand the respective other one. Most prominently, the quantity of  flour is not given in Philippine Welser\u2019s collection, but we can use the  \u2018two handfuls\u2019 of Sabina\u2019s as a reference point. Both recipes agree on  the need to work and knead the crust, and the second one presented here  compares it to *semel*, a dough for fine, white breadrolls. That  suggests to me that I was wrong to increase the ratio of fat to flour in  my most recent variation of Sabina Welserin\u2019s recipe. The intent really  is a kneadable, elastic dought with well-developed gluten. This really  works as we found out in my [pie workshop last November](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/13/a-renaissance-pie-workshop/).  The mix starts out hot and sticky, but as it is worked and cools, it  becomes pliable and stiff. The resulting crust is smooth and holds  liquid in well. It is not really a short crust in the modern sense, but  it belongs to that development and is much closer to modern hot water  crust than the earlier attested method of having the dough [absorb melted butter during baking](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/19/baking-pastries-the-italian-way/) found in the [*Kuchenmaistrey*](https://books2read.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach), among [other places](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/12/continuity-and-change-in-sheet-cake/). \n\nWe also hear that tart and pastry dough differ in the quality of the  flour used. While tarts consist of fine white flour, pastries are made  of half *nach mel*, an expression that suggests seconds, a lesser  quality. This might help us understand what the perceived difference  between tarts and pastries was since there seems to be no clear dividing  line otherwise: Both tart and pastry are closed, both can be baked in  tart pans in the embers as well as in ovens, there are round pastries,  pastry fillings can be sweet and fruity, tart fillings meaty and spicy.  Unfortunately, while the author of the collection suggests using only  second-quality flour for a venison pastry later, they immediately inform  us that no, many pastries are also made with the same fine flour tarts  are made with. \n\nAnyway, I hope to try both these recipes tomorrow and see what happens. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

I might  as well give up hope of returning to doing them daily. From the recipe  collection of Philippine Welser: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40v830ppaypc1.jpg?width=2622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=736e58a038956bfea79488a3528855ebe92fbf03\n\n ***57 If you want to make a crawfish tart***\n\n***Take crawfish and boil them until they are done.

Interestingly, some of those recipes specify that the crawfish, whether  cooked or raw, must be ground up with their shells  which will be  strained out as the mass is passed through a cloth. We tend to  automatically assume the crawfish in this recipe are shelled, but there  is really no reason to do that. \n\nA tart of bread-thickened, sweet crawfish puree probably does not  look all that appealing to modern diners. We  may well be happier with  the more sophisticated combination in the [Kuchenmaistrey](https://ellipsisimprints.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach/)\u2018s [pastries](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/27/crawfish-pastries-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/).

Then  sprinkle it with sugar and cinnamon and serve it.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe, though the technique is not unique. we  have a few recipes where tarts are prepared from fruit juices,  including [one from the same collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/11/sour-cherry-tarts/).  I tried out one with apple juice unsuccessfully, wondering how much  thickening would have played a role. This recipe suggests that it was  indeed a factor. \n\nAs regards the title, this is not a wine tart and I suspect it is called that by scribal error. The title repeats the word *wein* twice,  and in both places it could be intended to identify grapes (wein  draubenn) but for the interposition of the word for tart. I suspect this  is accidental. It is an easy mistake to make, and the recipe does not  involve wine. That meant that this was also a seasonal recipe, depending  on the availability of fresh grapes. Those could be[ preserved into winter by coating them in glue](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/18/food-preservation-and-storage-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/), but it\u2019s not likely this elaborately secured fruit would be sacrificed to make a tart.\n\nDepending on the proportion of flour, butter and sugar to juice, what  actually went into the tart might have been more like a batter than  what we would consider juice. We do well to recall that contemporaries,  again [including this very collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/17/preserving-quince-juice/), use the word *saft* for things [so strongly thickened we would class them as jellies](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/03/pear-syrup-from-the-oeconomia/).

{"title": "Two Recipes for Green Tart (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/09/two-recipes-for-green-tart/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/09/two-recipes-for-green-tart/)\n\n I love green tart, and these two recipes from the collection of Philippine Welser are interesting:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqy39p77fdnc1.jpg?width=557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8268519d755ac617a308d2b13df9d46ec522a79a\n\n***51 If you want to make a tart of greens (krautt dortten)***\n\n***Take on your table sage leaves, eight marjoram sprigs, a handful of parsley, 5 leaves of lemon balm (melisen,  Melissa officinalis), 12 leaves of bugloss, a little chervil (?), 10  endive leaves, 10 borage leaves, a little chervil (?), and about four  times as much chard (mangelt) as there is of the other herbs. If they are clean, do not wash them and chop them small. Then put them into hot fat and fry (reschs)  them in it. Then put them in a bowl and grate cheese of the best kind  into it, a little ginger, pepper, sugar, and 10 eggs or more, until it  is quite thin. Mix it well together and pour it out on a base that is  very thin, and let it bake. When it is almost baked, put a little butter  on it and sprinkle it with sugar. This is for two tarts, take half as  much to make one and let it bake fully.***\n\n***52 If you want to make a tart of greens (krautt dortten)***\n\n***Take young chard (piesen) and all kinds of  fragrant herbs, wash them, press them out well, and fry them in fat.  Then put them into a bowl and grate good cheese into it as well as a  wheaten bread. Put this in with the herbs and stir it together. Take  eggs and a little cream, colour it yellow and season it with good spice  powder. Stir it together well and make a base, put it into the tart pan  and pour the filling on it. Cover it with another (dough) sheet and  close it with a wreath (braided edge). Let it bake, but grease the pan  with fat beforehand, then it will not burn. If you want it sweet, add  sugar. When it has baked for a while, but a hole in the top and put in  some sweet butter and put it in (repetition?). You can also bake this in  an oven.***\n\nWhile this is not quite exactly the identical recipe, the two are so  close to each other that they are functionally the same thing. Recipe  #51 gives an unusually detailed list of the herbs and spices required  while #52 remains unspecific. Recipe #52 calls for cream, which #51  omits, and specifies the addition of a top crust which is not mentioned  in #51. Altogether, though, this is the same filling of chard, herbs,  cheese, eggs, and spices we  know [in various iterations](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/06/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-i/) from [several other recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/21/italian-influence-in-the-innsbruck-ms/). I am quite fond of it, though I haven\u2019t tried this sopecific mix yet. \n\nOne interesting feature is that the two recipes use a different name for chard. Recipe #51 calls it *mangelt*, a cognate of the modern *Mangold*, while #52 has *piesen*,  a word that today only survives in dialects. This suggests that the two  recipes originate from different sources and were copied faithfully  into one collection at one point without standardising the vocabulary.  This flexible recombination of recipes and whole sections seems to be [a feature of many German recipe collections](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=parallel).  \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

{"title": "Cheese Tart (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/05/cheese-tart/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/05/cheese-tart/)\n\n Another brief recipe: Cheese Tart from Philippine Welser\u2019s collection. \n\n ***46 If you want to make a cheese tart***\n\n***First take a good, sweet, fat cheese that is not old or crumbly (resch).  Grate it small and put the grated cheese into a bowl, as much as you  please. Add 2 times as much egg and 4 times as much butter so it can  become like a thin batter (diner tayg), and add a very small  amount of flour to it. Stir it well in the bowl, but do not make the  batter too thin, so that you can keep it on the tart base (boden). Last, add some dissolved sugar (der lasnen zucker) to it. Then bake it nicely small, and when it is baked, sprinkle sugar on it while it is hot. Thus it is proper and good.***\n\nThus is an interesting recipe, if not an innovative one. It is quite  similar to the rich \u201cEnglish\u201d tarts found in a few earlier sources.  These would typically combine cleese and butter with or without eggs.  The addition of sugar is not surprising in the sixteenth century, but I  am not entirely sure whether the *der lasnen zucker* mentioned here is sugar syrup (see [clarified sugar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/30/clarifying-sugar-after-walter-ryff/)) or melted sugar. In any case, clarifying sugar does not preclude [caramelising it to some degree](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/16/clarifying-sugar-with-philippine-welser/).\n\nThe proportions of 4 parts butter and two parts egg to one part sugar  seem improbable, but bound with fine flour, this could become something  like an extremely rich batter. It is not an ancestor of Yorkshire  pudding though \u2013 baking at a low temperature would keep it from fluffing  up. I am tempted to try it just to see what it will actually do. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

We served a varied and rather heavy dessert, and I was  slightly surprised that all recipes worked out well. Much food was taken  away again. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5q6puj7027lc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9beb1ec168b04086c4a6f6dafccd54bde604988\n\nFirst, there were the recipes for *Fastenkrapfen* from the Mondseer Kochbuch:\n\n***54 Fritters (*****krapphen*****) of nuts***\n\n***Take entire kernels of nuts and cut as many apples into that in cubes, Fry (*****r\u00f6st*****) them well with a little honey and mix it with spices.

Add spices and fill it into the fritters and let  them fry, and do not oversalt them.***\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15a2zq9527lc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6898dd5dc887db4d5f9898a04a9755907b000f48\n\nThese are fairly safe recipes in that it is quite hard to make  something unpleasant from apples, nuts, honey, and raisins. For the  first filling, I simply processed equal volumes of chopped apple and  raisins together and added cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg and cloves. The  second took a little more work as the cubed apples and whole hazelnut  kernels were first fried in butter, then had honey added. The result,  though, was excellent. I wrapped both in a hot water short crust based  on a sixteenth-century recipe and baked them because this was mainly a  test of the fillings and time economy was important. \n\nThe dough was on hand because of the second dish, a tart of root  vegetables from the sixteenth-century recipe collection of Philippine  Welser:\n\n***23 To make as root vegetable (*****raubenn*****) tart***\n\n***Take roots (*****ryeb*****) and peel them. Then put them  in water and let them boil. Then, you pound them very small in a mortar  and add six egg yolks and freshly melted butter, sugar, cinnamon and  ginger, grated semel bread and a little milk. Salt it well and let it  bake a quarter hour, then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on it.***\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mlzy61827lc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5c9979605258b664b4384c9cebf73b20c67c1e3\n\nThis recipe interested me from the start, with the main question being what kind of root vegetables would suit it best. *R\u00fcben* can  mean almost any kind, with variations differing regionally in an era  before standardised seed trade. For this first attempt, I decided to go  with parsnips and parsley roots. Their sweetness would harmonise with  the cinnamon and sugar, and their spicy note add to the depth of the  dish. I peeled, boiled, and mashed the roots, added egg yolks, and  seasoned the mix with cinnamon, ginger, and a small amount of sugar. A  little butter stirred in completed the filling which I then baked in a  covered pie, slowly at 175\u00b0C. The result was convincing, but not as  excellent as the *Fastenkrapfen* which I will definitely include in future feasts and a projected childrens\u2019 historic recipe book.\n\nThe crust is my usual standby for sixteenth-century recipes: one cup  of water and a quarter pound of butter or lard are heated in a saucepan  until the water begins to boil. Meanwhile, you ready four cups of flour  in a bowl and lay out two eggs. The water and fat go into the flour  first, boiling hot, and are stirred in quickly. Then you add the eggs  and work everything into a dough. Turn that out on a work surface and  knead it, working in flour gradually until it is no longer sticky. It is  best rolled out still warm, but can be worked cold and even kept in the  fridge. This crust holds liquids well and, if it is made thick enough,  can be made into free-standing pastries. It is not as pleasant to eat as  proper short crust, but much nicer than most contemporary recipes I  know.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1b1n9rr/fastenkrapfen_15th_c_and_a_pie_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1709068539.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1b1n9rr/fastenkrapfen_15th_c_and_a_pie_c_1550/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Then peel them as thinly as you can,  and take out the cores. Then pound them in a mortar and put it into a  bowl. Take half a pound of well pounded sugar with it, rosewater on  account of the scent, and eight newly laid eggs, but only the whites.  Mix all of this together, and if you want, add spices to it.

You can also do this  with pureed quinces (er dryben), Make a crust on top, or do as you please, and let it bake nicely. When you wish to serve it, sprinkle it well with sugar.***\n\nThis is very close to the way she makes [apple ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/06/as-augsburgian-as-apple-pie/)and [pear tarts](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/11/pear-tarts/),  with no particular surprises to be had. One interesting point in recipe  #45 is the way quince juice \u2013 pressed from the grated fruit \u2013 is used  to parcook the quince slices that go into the tart. That is necessary,  of course; quinces are much harder than apples or pears. The choice to  use laboriously rendered juice, though, suggests that the flavour of the  quince thus concentrated was greatly prized. This also means that the  tarts will be less rich than the apple or pear ones that use fat for  parcooking. Their fruitier, lighter taste could well appeal more to  modern diners. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

Then strain it through a linen cloth and press out the quinces very  well. It does no harm if it (the juice) is opaque, that just makes it  better. Then measure the juice and take a pound of sugar to an eighth (*****achterlin*****)  of juice, but if you wish to have it sweeter, you can take more sugar.  Then set it over a good fire and let it boil quickly. When you want to  see whether it has boiled enough, take a silver spoon, dip it into the  juice, and let it cool. If a skin (*****heyttl*****) is formed on the  spoon, it has boiled enough. But though it is thick now, it is not yet  good. You can then pour it into any vessel you like and it will throw up  a foam. Take that off.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe, but its description is misleading to  modern readers. We are looking at something more like a jelly, not what  we would think of as a fruit juice.

Chop sage small, fry it in butter, mix in eggs, spices, saffron, and salt, and prepare a thick mass (*****habich mou\u00df*****) of it. Put it back in the eggshells and lay them in boiling water.***\n\nFilling seasoned egg back into eggshells was a common conceit in  German cookery, and this is not an unusual recipe. It has a parallel in  Meister Hans: \n\n***Recipe #88*** **Ain habich muo\u00df von ayren**\n\n***A \u2018falcon dish\u2019 of eggs***\n\n***Item chop sage small and fry it in butter. Mix herbs and  saffron into it and make a \u2018falcon dish\u2019 from it. Fill it back into the  shells and lay them into boiling water. Boil them and quarter them  nicely afterwards.***\n\nThe original editor assumed that *habich* here should be read as *Habicht*,  a falcon, and the way that vthe manuscript uses the term as a title  suiggests that was how the writer understood it. It is unclear how the  dish relates to birds of prey, but that is not in itself disqualifying.  There are few nondescriptive names in the German corpus, but thoser that  there are often defy analysis. However, there was always the  possibility that the word related to *h\u00e4bich*, a dialect term  meaning thick, viscous, or \u2018chewy\u2019. The version from the Mondseer  Kochbuch makes it much more likely this is meant. It belongs to the  dialect area where that term was current, and it clearly uses it  descriptively, not as a name. Again, we must conclude that if \u2018Meister  Hans\u2019 is the origin of a tradition, the surviving manuscript must be a  late copy. \n\nIn gustatory terms, it is an attractive dish. Fresh sage goes well  with boiled egg, and the extra butteriness raises the flavour. In terms  of looks, it is less endearing unless you happen to like green eggs.  They actually go well with ham.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it.

Boil and shell the  peas well in water. Drain the broth and keep them for (i.e. to serve  with) toasted sops, seasoned with spices so it is barely noticeable (kaum zu br\u00fcffen)  and coloured yellow. Take the peas into a clean wide bowl (becken) and  mash them well with a large spoon. Take them for a dish and put them  into a fine colander (pfeffer pfan). Pass them through with your hand into nice serving bowls. Raise the colander high so that the peas come out separately (gezettelt)  like earthworms, big and small. Try to keep those whole and not break  them, and make them go into the bowl and not hang over (the bowl\u2019s edge)  and let them harden (gesteen). Then take and boil good wine  with honey to sprinkle over this and strew sugar on it. This tastes good  if the peas are not oversalted, therefore try them first before you  pour off the broth and colour it yellow.***\n\n***Item make good patties from the other part of the peas  thus. Strew your hands with flour and press the patties together. Make a  batter of yellow-coloured wine and dredge the patties in that. Lift  them into a pan with a spoon and fry them, as many of them as you wish.  Serve good pea broth over them, coloured yellow and seasoned with salt  and spices, and serve it. Strew raisins in it and pure butter. Covered  in a courtly fashion, this is served to a prince.***\n\n***1.lix Item again of pea patties that are fried gently and  well. (They are) served in a pepper sauce of toasted white bread  seasoned with salt in its proper manner. Try this (before you serve it).***\n\n***1.lx Item if you would skilfully make a pepper sauce of flour, fry (bren,  lit: burn) flour in fat. Not too quickly. Temper it with wine, colour  it yellow and spice it. Fry pea patties as described above and pour the  pepper sauce over them. If you have small boiled raisins, strew them  into this and make the pepper sauce for that, be it with wine or with  water.***\n\n***1.lxi Item if you would serve a courtly dish to your guests on a fast day, take care (flei\u00df dich)  with the pea patties with good dried pears nicely peeled and prepared.  Lay them into the serving bowl with the pea patties. Take the soaking  water of the pears (dz birn wasser) and mix a little honey with it. Make a sauce (zise\u00fcndlein)  or a pepper sauce, seasoned well in its proper manner, over the patties  and the pears. Put pure butter and fresh ginger on them and serve it.  If you do not have pears, make roast apples, quartered or dredged in a  batter and fried in fat.***\n\nYes, 1.lx is a roux, what Germans call an *Einbrenne*. It is not the earliest instance either. The story that this was invented in France in the reign of Louis XIV is wrong. \n\nThe entire sert of recipes nicely illustrates how a base process \u2013  cooking peas \u2013 could lead into a  variety of dishes, in this case mashed  peas with honey sauce and fritters that in turn go with a number of  sauces and accompaniments. Especially the final version \u2013 buttered pea  fritters served in a saffron roux sauce with fried pears or apple slices  and raisins \u2013 is an attractive and refined dish. Depending on the  availability of winter stores of long-lasting fruit, but no fresh meat  or herbs, this dish would be well-placed on any wintertime fast day. \n\nThe *Kuchenmaistrey* (mastery of the kitchen) was the earliest  printed cookbook in German (and only missed being the earliest printed  cookbook in any language by a few years). The book gave rise to a  vibrant culture of amended and expanded manuscript copies as well as  reprints spanning almost a century. The recipes seem designed to appeal  to a wealthy, literate and cosmopolitan clientele.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/18cepfh/kuchenmaistrey_in_print_and_pea_patties_c_1490/", "created_utc": 1701897973.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/18cepfh/kuchenmaistrey_in_print_and_pea_patties_c_1490/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["It would have never occurred to me to serve peas with pears, but it actually sounds delicious...", "Post the link again for your book!

Aside from being another  parallel with the Meister Hans collection, it is one of my wintertime  favourites: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4hhwbiewq2c1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07d934723ec8f541b218d8947f920f3d6db1aae8\n\n***135 Back roast of a roe deer, or a hare roasted entire***\n\n***Of back roast.

Note, judging by the lightness  (of the dough), whether it is baked entirely. You can also bake hare in  one piece this way.***\n\nThis is clearly the same recipe. As medieval recipes go, it is also a  very nice one. It sets the threshold for engaging with it as a newcomer  very low, offering a familiar  format and an easy technique. If you  have never worked with venison and would like to, it is a good  beginner\u2019s dish. It will not dry out or burn, and even if you fail to  achieve the perfect pink-in-the-centre doneness moderns aim for, you  will have a tender, flavourful piece of meat to serve with a [medieval ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/13/berry-sauces/)[fruit ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/27/a-cherry-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/)[sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/17/redcurrant-sauce-from-the-oeconomia/). \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmptjdbgwq2c1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c07ac302124b5a11b94ff85ba66b558095528a93\n\nI made this for the booksigning part for my Landsknecht Cookbook, and  it was very successful there. The crust I used was a basic combination  of flour, eggs, and butter, with a high proportion of eggs to make it  pliable and impermeable. The meat was barded with bacon strips (larding  is possible, but in my opinion excessive effort in this case) and rubbed  with salt, pepper, ginger, and caraway. I then baked it slowly at only  140\u00b0C for almost four hours. It can be done at a higher temperature  faster, as it probably was in thermal mass ovens in the 15th century,  but this is the simplest approach and very useful if you are busy with  other things. \n\nAs an aside, the slightly more detailed recipe in the 1460 Meister  Hans manuscript suggests that the Mondseer Kochbuch or its family is not  the source of Meister Hans. It is therefore plausible that Meister Hans  is indeed what it purports to be, and the collection was already in  circulation in the late 1430s. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.

Stir all of this together and do not  oversalt it. Fill the tart with this and do not put a lid on it. Slide  it into the oven and bake it. Moisten a brush with warm butter and brush  the tart with this above and below so that it shines brightly, and let  it cool. And this is how you bake Osterfladen. (clxxviii v)***\n\nThe first is just another kind of drinking snack, a lot like the [ginger chips](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/16/ginger-crunchies/)  I tried a few weeks ago. I usaed a hot water crust, so it was harder  and chewier than a modern shortcrust base would be, but that is not a  problem. It is not bad, just a little dull without additional spices.  After I added a little pepper, it was quite good.\n\nThe second recipe is odd, and clearly suffers from an excess of  luxury. It is meant to be an Easter dish, but by using imported durable  Parmesan cheese rather than fresh cheese from the first milk of the  spring, it loses its seasonal connection. It could now be made at any  time. Interestingly, this *Osterfladen* is also related to[ the *Pressmetzen* that Balthasar Staindl suggests for Easter](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/06/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-i/). He uses custard in place of regular dairy cheese which I suspect was the most common method. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9ptqytbkeyb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d799fac428ffaac85a1c28a88ac8fcd0824523f\n\n The result I got was quite acceptable, though I should have salted it  more. The raisins harmonise well with the cheese and the almonds are  barely noticeable except for the crunch. Personally, I would put in some  spices \u2013 mace might work, pepper certainly will \u2013  and cut back on the  cream and butter. It is an insanely rich pie.

In fact, it is quite similar to [\\#19 in the same collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/12/tripe-from-the-mondseer-kochbuch/).

Pour this on the*** **galdrain**. ***Add fat and let it boil up so it turns thick. If you do not have green herbs (gr\u00fcn ding), use different seasoning (condiment). Thus you prepare*** **galran**.\n\nThe dish described here seems to be fairly straightforward: Boiled  pork and pig\u2019s stomach, cut into large cubes (presumably  bite-sized,  possibly portion-sized) is served with a thick vinegar herb sauce bound  with bread and enriched with eggs. The interestingh part is that is uses  the word *galdrein*, *galdrain* or *galran* to describe it. We have[ encountered the word before](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/10/liver-in-honey-and-an-interesting-verb/), often spelled *galrey* or *galray*, a cognate of galantine and the modern German word *Gallert*. The modern word refers to a jelly, and [the medieval term could mean that, too](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/08/medieval-gelatin-powder-and-the-next-book-project/).  However, it also opften referred to a thick, spicy sauce that was used  to preserve meat in. This was often bound with bread or gingerbread and  had to be thick enough to prevent meat from floating up while excluding  outside air. There is no indication that this is the intention here, and  it is hard to see how a sauce including egg and fresh herbs could serve  the purpose. A *galdrein* here is clearly just a thick sauce.\n\nIn recipe #19, a very similar sauce is referred to as a *condiment*:\n\n***19 How to prepare pigs\u2019 guts and stomachs in a*** **condiment** ***sauce***\n\n***Take boiled pigs\u2019 guts and stomachs. Cut the boiled guts into four parts. Also cut the stomachs narrow*** (**smal** ***\u2013 in strips?). And cut the stomach and the guts as small as you wish. Take parsley, pennyroyal, and mint, boiled (gesoten)  sage, hard-boiled eggs, fine bread, the greatest quantity of caraway,  not much pepper, and one egg to a dish. Grind (make) it with vinegar and  with broth (s\u00f6de) so it does  not become too sour, and pour it on the condiment. Add fat and let it  warm up, and take it up before it becomes too thick and serve it.***\n\nIt is also interestingh how the wording of the cooking instruction  parallelsa cdespite the actual outcome described being somewhat  different. I wonder whether this is the result of a transmission chain  that went from manuscript through oral interpretation to another written  text at one point. It is certainly noteworthy, even more so in the  original German.  Incidenbtally, this makes it plausible again that most  German recipe collections surviving were collated from various sources  in circulation to meet individual needs. It is highly unlikely both  these recipes were included into a single text deliberately.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

There are similar instructions from [other sources in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/21/rice-recipes-from-the-kuenstlichs-und-fuertrefflichs-kochbuch/) providing more detail.

It will stay as thick as you can manage best.If  you would know whether it is cooked, take the grains between the  fingers. If they mash and are not hard, it is done. Serve it with sugar.***\n\nAs late as the 1550s, the idea is the same in the Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch:\n\n***4 To cook rice***\n\n***Take thick milk and let it boil. Pick over (klaube) the rice cleanly, and when it has been cleaned (erklaubt),  put it into a bowl. Pour boiling water over it and blanch it well, then  strain off the water. When the milk is boiling, add the rice and set it  into the coals and let it boil until it becomes soft. Then add sugar,  and you shall salt it when you wish to serve it.***\n\nMeanwhile, the idea of cooking rice so that the grains remain separate, as we tend to prefer it today, was [ considered an alien, oriental habit](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/29/turkish-recipes-in-rumpolt-1581/).\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

It was a fascinating experience to see how an appoach very different from mine produced deliciousness, learning, and joy.  \n\nThe theme of the feast was Sicily. Not, as I am wont to do, a specific time period or set of sources, but a journey through its culinary history from the Neolithic to the modern era. Many of the dishes were based on written sources or extant tradition, others creative interpretations of documented combinations of ingredients and flavours, all combined to produce a cohesive whole while reflecting the wide variety that existed over time and geography.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bb0hhye9y1tb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3086ecb1702495ace60ae8cdae9d640a2c699928\n\nThe first course, reflecting the transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to cereal agriculture, consisted of roast quail, mushrooms, and cooked spelt wrapped in vine leaves. The quail rested on a whole slice of boletus mushroom, obviously not historical practice, but delicious with the reduced mushroom liquor seasoning the meat. The spelt dolmades, again not fully plausible \u2013 wine is not grown on Sicily until much later \u2013 add the rich solidity of cereal grain without overpowering the sylvan notes of the main feature.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4trn3say1tb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4294a6bb1865223ab564e45bd271d04843ab62d\n\nThe arrival of the Greeks was the focus of the second course, a light and sweet combination of figs and cheese with honey. It serves as a reminder of the wealth of fruit agriculture that enriches Mediterranean cuisine and the way that animals, both domesticated, like sheep, and feral, as the bees then were, added to the breadth of pleasures. We know that cheese and honey were combined in Greek times though no recipes as such exist. This combination, like cheese and pears or oil and fragrant herbs, feels absolutely natural.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ns5t7k0cy1tb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e309448abab923953b442c6a856d270989f4637\n\nChickpeas and artichokes introduced the advent of Rome. The former are, of course, referenced in the name of Marcus Tullius Cicero, a champion, early in his career, of the cities of Sicily against the depredations of their Roman governor Verres. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n605nf8dy1tb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f14884115b48a3792d82ce52de54a35f584b55f\n\nArtichokes, meanwhile, have a more convoluted connection in their association with the Jewish population of the city of Rome. This tradition may not go back farther than the Renaissance, but the reminder is timely. It was under Roman rule that the first Jewish communities formed in Sicily, many not arriving of their own free will, but as deportees. The chickpeas were served roasted, as we know ancient Romans liked to snack on them, and in their modern form of falafel, a food that straddles another demarcation line of religious and ethnic identity in today\u2018s Mediterranean world. The combination was poignant, but delicious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbx8agyey1tb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62388209d6bc120b56b60fdf1551fdd371025015\n\nByzantium, really a continuation of Rome\u2018s rule over its oldest province, was referenced with tuna, coated in sesame, grilled, and lightly dusted with cheese, a practice Greek dietary manualy counsel against as a Sicilian deviation. It made for a lighter touch to the palate as well as a reminder of the treasures of the sea that surround the island. Sicilian food is no more imaginable without the wealth of its fisheries than without the wheat and olives that form its backbone.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6nm0yngy1tb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b6e5f4636f1d9ab7fb1b366ebde7321d4c79125\n\nThe next great revolution in the fate of Sicily came with the arrival of Fatimid armies and the establishment of the Qalbid emirs in Palermo. It was here that the political centre of the island shifted from its east coast to its west, and that new crops and forms of agriculture arrived. A combination of chicken, coated in a combination of almonds, spices, and citron, inspired by known Arabic recipes but adapted to serve as fingerfood, was combined with glazed chestnuts. Chestnuts, one of the oldest crops of the European Mediterranean, is here married to sugar, the latest arrival of the Arab era. My sole regret was that there was not more of it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5bni99iy1tb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=610595e68fe81e1475335db9e956f0514978fdac\n\nThe conquest of the island by the Normans was marked by a rich, meaty, salty celebration of their northern culinary tradition. Fennel-seasoned sausage meat wrappd in veal and rolled in thin slices of ham, served with cactus pears, a fruit entirely alien to their way of eating, but emblematic of their fascination with their sophisticated southern realm. We know that both the Hauteville kings and their Hohenstaufen successors were served by Arabic-speaking cooks, marrying the carnivorous excess of their ancestors with the culinary art of their conquest.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brubgyqky1tb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eecb0c6aa88e1d5527768482aaeb0bfd189c1cbf\n\nModernity arrived in the guise of sweet confections, fig rolls, cream-filled cannoli, and finally an entire cake in the shape of a fire-breathing volcano. These things, now considered a glory of Sicilian cuisine, came into being as an established Arab tradition of sugar cookery is combined with innovative ideas from the mainland \u2013 whipping cream, crumbly \u201ashort\u2018 cookies, chemically leavened cakes, and the profusion of sweet dishes that increasingly cheaper sugar allowed. The pomp and circumstance of the famous kingdom of Naples, politically an appendage of Aragon and Spain, but culturally its own universe, shone through.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plg3ui4my1tb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d98968560b995c0ac6eb9f809144d7137aac3bfe\n\nThe entire experience was fascinating, if a little disorienting to me. I would never have done it like this. My way would have been a deep dive into sources, a combination of plausible dishes, documentable foods, and increasingly tenuous guesses to fill the gaps in my knowledge to arrive at a meal of known quantities. Combining singular data points into a web of cross-references, an experience eerily reminiscent of the intertextual reading so much good postmodern fiction encourages, was never part of my repertoire. That day, I learned that it can be extremely rewarding and make the past accessible in ways that the more antiquarian mode cannot.  \n\nThe lady in question has offered to collaborate on a feast arranged around the theme of Valois Burgundy. I very much look forward to the project.

{"title": "Another Plantain Pie Experiment", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/29/another-plantain-pie-experiment/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/29/another-plantain-pie-experiment/)\n\nJust a quick kitchen note for today: Another experiment on the theme of [Jean-Baptiste Labat\u2019s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Labat) banana pie. As noted in [earlier ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/10/pere-labats-banana-pie/)[posts](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/18/labats-plantain-pie-second-experiment/), the 17th century writer Labat described pies among many uses for plantains and bananas:\n\n***Plantains, (bananes), just like*** **figues de l\u2019Amerique**, ***can be cooked in*** ***tartes******. They are prepared with sugar, cinnamon, and a little lemon or orange peel. Note that the Spanish call the*** **figue d\u2019Amerique** ***the*** **banane** ***and the*** **banane** ***the*** **plantain**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[It was quite good](https://preview.redd.it/yzy1rbrjc5rb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76ed393f8219ec0f35a2cfe2b7251311ca12690f)\n\nHis description of the *banane* and *figue d\u2019Amerique*  make it clear that the former is a variety of cooking banana, the latter  what we would recognise as an eating banana, though shorter and rounder  than our familiar [Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana).  I already know the recipe works well with modern bananas and  surprisingly well with relatively fresh plantains, I also wanted to see  how it  performed with very ripe plantains. Since these are not sold  here \u2013 German shoppers are rarely familiar with the fruit and thus leery  of buying one that shows  even the first brown spots -, I had to buy  them green and leave one to ripen in my kitchen until the skin turned  completely black.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cwhop4blc5rb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=907a07176d35413919dc49e7c9d9fd0c5cf74202\n\nI was apprehensive as I peeled it, but the fruit inside was soft, firm,  and surprisingly sweet. This, I suppose, is the level of ripeness other  17th-century authors describe being mashed and eaten as a relish with  cooked cassava or roasted plantains. It was certainly possible to eat  this uncooked with some pleasure, but it was still sliceable, so into  the pie it went.\n\n[Apologies for the bad lighting](https://preview.redd.it/hxtmlphmc5rb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd4d8c5b441e77753aff87f16d2b4c0f2fdbf199)\n\nI used storebought crust again and this time went with lemon zest (I  had half of one left over from making Oxford Sausages for my son), and  the result was even more convincing than the first plaintain experiment.  The filling remained in discrete pieces, but it was so soft you could  not feel them when biting into it. The sugar, cinnamon, and lemon zest  dissolved completely, creating a unified flavour. On the whole, this pie  was an unqualified success everyone (except my son) enjoyed. But then,  he didn\u2019t like the Oxford Sausages either and preferred standard meat  loaf.\n\nI kept half for eating the next day and it was still good. It makes  an interesting recipe and a timely reminder that in many cases, how ripe  a fruit or vegetable is can make a big difference for the outcome.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16v4zwm/another_plantain_pie_experiment/", "created_utc": 1695972408.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16v4zwm/another_plantain_pie_experiment/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Chicken Pancake Pies (c. 1440)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/28/chicken-pancake-pies/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/28/chicken-pancake-pies/)\n\nTwo recipes in the Mondseer Kochbuch demonstrate an interesting mode of  serving chicken and the fact that recipe titles in German collections  are basically random.\n\n***46 How you can prepare toasted bread to go over a chicken***\n\n***You should roast a chicken. And toast a slice of semel  bread, and fry the bread in fat. Cut pieces as though for a bread  porridge (prot muos). Cut the chicken up (zuo leg) small and roast six pears and make a condiment sauce of wine and honey, and take anise with it. Prepare a pancake (platt)  of five eggs: Break them into the pan, lay in each (piece of chicken  and pear?) separately and fold over the pancake. Invert a bowl over it  and then flip over the pan. Cut a hole in the top and pour in the  condiment sauce, and do not pour it on the pancake. These are called  chickens of the Rheingau (H\u00fcnner von Ringkau).***\n\n***47 How to prepare a condiment sauce to go over chickens, poor knights (fried egg bread) and apples cooked in a pan***\n\n***You should roast a chicken filled with bacon, and fry the  \u2018poor knights\u2019 in fat, not too dry. Peel sour apples and cut them into  broad slices so the seeds drop out. Fry them a little in fat. Then  prepare a large pancake (plat) of eggs that covers the entire pan and add spices. Put the first shield (schilt) in very little condiment (probably misreading*** **schilt** ***for*** **schiht**) ***and prepare a condiment sauce of honey and wine, and do not spice it too much (******zuo heis******). Fold the pancake together above, invert a bowl over it and flip over the pan. Cut an opening (******venster******) above and pour in condiment sauce over it and serve it. These are called chickens of cake (******H\u00fcnner von Kuochen******) (they are \u2018Greek\u2019 in the Buoch von Guoter Spise).***\n\nAgain, these recipes have parallels in the [*Buoch von Guoter Spise* ](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise)(#50  and 51, respectively) which are there titled \u201cof roasted food\u201d and \u201ca  dish\u201d. Comparing them helps us make sense of the errors that crept into  the versions here: The \u201cfirst shield\u201d mentioned in #47 is actually the  first layer, and the cryptic instruction to put it in little condiment  is resolved as we find the earlier source describing a layering of first  apples, then fried bread, and finally chicken, with a small amount of  spices between each. The title of the recipe, too, seems to have been  garbled as it is there called *h\u00fcenre von kriechen*, Greek chicken. The first recipe is closer to the *Buoch* and  a comparison does not help us figure out what is meant by \u201ceach  separately\u201d, but very likely the intent here, too, is to layer the  ingredients.\n\nA very interesting point in both these recipes is that the food is  served in a kinde of pie  constructed from pancakes (or just fried egg).  There is a roughly analogous pie shell made from egg swirled to coat a  heated mortar in the 1598 coobook by Anna Wecker, but this is  technically quite different: You prepare a *Blatt*, in this case  clearly a soft pancake, stack the food on it, fold over the edges to  enclose it, then invert it into a bowl so the unbroken centre faces up. I  suspect with a little practice  you can get a very smooth, round top  with the filling hidden entirely. A small opening is then cut into it  and sauce poured in but, as we are instructed, not over it. Cutting into  this globe would reveal a delicious interior of chicken pieces, fruit,  and spicy honey sauce. I tried the technique once, many years ago, but  did not quite dare to replicate it fully, lining a round bowl with the  pancake before layering the filling and inverting it onto a serving bowl  after. It was very attractive indeed, and will probably be even better  if it comes straight from the pan, still hot. This is definitely  something to try again.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

Note that here, my interpretation strongly differs from that by Aichholzer. \n\n \n\n[A different style of roast milk after pressing overnight](https://preview.redd.it/rf76wtic0aob1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c3a6b51f90c4081991b772893e402689ff9fe92)\n\n***22 How you can roast milk on a spit***\n\n***Take milk that is not fat and that has gelled (*****gelebret*****)  and break the pot if (?) it does not slide out easily onto a sackcloth.  Let it be tied up in this and weight it, at first gently, then more.  Let it drain (read*** **seihen** ***for*** **sieden** ***\u2013 boil) from  morning till evening. Then slice it thin and skewer it, and sprinkle it  with salt. Lay it on a wooden griddle and let it roast well, and throw  on a little pepper (*****pipeus*****), and spread it witgh butter or with fat if it is a meat day.***\n\nAichholzer reads the instruction as wrapping a pot in cloth and submerging it in boiling water for a day, but though the verb *sieden* supports this, I do not see how it would achieve the desired aim. I thus believe the word is a misreading of *seihen*,  to drain. This emendation produces a clearer reading of the rest of the  recipe as well: the coagulated milk is removed from the pot, wrapped in  sackcloth, and gradually weighed down to drain the liquid. The  resulting solid is then spitted on skewers and roasted on a griddle. The  parallel recipe in the [Buoch von guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (#25) does not use either verb, but instructs us to let the milk lie as it is weighted down. \n\nOf course, [roast ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/13/roasted-milk-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[milk ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/18/faux-roasted-milk-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/30/roast-milk-again-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[are a](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/04/roasted-milk-of-almonds-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/) [dime ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/roast-milk-from-the-rheinfrankisches-kochbuch/)a[ dozen ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/19/another-roasted-milk-recipe/)in [our sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/23/hemp-milk-cooking/).  Here, we do not learn the most interesting aspect: how is the milk  coagulated? Some recipes use egg, but I suspect here we are looking at  the bacterial action that also produced the [solid, edible sour milk](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/08/herbstmilch-from-the-inntalkochbuch-and-beyond/) infamous as peasant food.

Split it and cut  it to pieces. Chop parsley and sage, take pounded ginger, pepper, and  anise. Salt it in measure. Prepare a coarse dough (*****derben taig*****) according to the size of the pieces and throw the seasoning (*****das kraut*****) onto the pieces and wrap them in (*****bewirff sey mit*****)  the dough. If you can stamp them in a mould, do that. You can also  prepare pike and trout this way. And fry each one separately in the  dough. But if it is a meat day, you can prepare chickens, partridges,  pigeons and pheasants this way if you have the moulds. And fry them in  fat or boil them in their moulds. Take chicken breasts or other good  meat, thus the art will be all the better. Do not oversalt it, and serve  it.***\n\nAs a combination, it sounds quite attractive: Salmon slices en croute  with parsley and sage seasoned with ginger, pepper, and anise. Salmon  hot pockets, almost. The treatment of the fish is quite modern, too;  Instead of either mashing it or leaving it whole, neither of which  appeals to most contemporary Europeans, it is cut into portion-sized  pieces. If you are trying to get your friends or family to try  historical European food, this is not the worst place to start. \n\nAnother interesting point is that the fish pastries are moulded. That  is presumably the  meaning behind a derben taig. The dough is not made  from coarse meal or otherwise rough, it is firm and holds its shape. The  qualifier \u201cif you have those moulds\u201d with the poultry suggests that the  mould meant here is fish-shaped. Whether we are talking about flat  pastries with a fish stamped on them or something a lot more  three-dimensional is unclear, but there certainly were quite elaborate  moulds for making faux dishes and boiling in them, as described here, is  [a familiar technique](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/07/fish-loaf-recipes-from-cgm-384/).

The  individual fritters are going to be quite small, tightly packed morsels  of intense flavour. It is definitely something I want to try out one  day.

Wash the peas well in water with the skin and let them boil, and do not  oversalt them. Serve them this way or colour the sauce (*****prulein*****) yellow etc.***\n\n***87 If you would make a pastry (*****pasteten*****), take eggs and cook them in fat like scrambled eggs (*****ein ger\u00fcert air*****).  Beat them and then take fat that is hot in a mortar and put the eggs  into it. Then take birds and fry them in fat, and add the eggs, or take  roast chickens and cut them apart and also stick them in (*****the egg*****) and let the feet stick out above. You can also use fried (*****pachen*****) fish with this.***\n\n***88 If you would prepare shaggy (*****zotet*****) peas, boil them like the Bohemian ones and then let them boil dry so that the water boil away (*****einsied*****). Then pound them well and season them, add honey, and pass them through a strainer. This way they will look like worms (*****maden*****).***\n\n***89 If you would make them black, prepare them with toasted (*****prantem*****) bread. Pound this very fine and mix it in, and then pass them through in the same manner etc.***\n\n***90 If you would fry them, also prepare them in this  manner and let them become thick, then shape small balls and fry those,  and roll them in*** **strauben** ***batter etc.***\n\n***91 If you would fry them in another manner, prepare them  in the above way again and beat eggs into them and make a batter and fry  that. Shape them into little balls with a spoon etc.***\n\n***92 If you would make cake (*****chuechen*****) from them, prepare the peas as described above and beat eggs into them, and then put it into hot fat in a mortar or in a pot (*****scherben*****) or in a pan and let it fry in that.***\n\nThis is the first half of a block of recipes that (mostly) deal with  peas. They are not unique \u2013 in fact, there are interesting parallels  with the Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch \u2013 but the quantity and  concentration is. \n\nRecipe #86  is slightly confusing \u2013 the peas are treated with lye  to  detach the skin, but it then suggests the skins are processed with the  peas. Other recipes of this kind separate them out, and I suspect that  is the intent here also. As to what makes these peas Bohemian, I am not  sure. There is a recipe for Bohemian peas in the recipe collection of  Sabina Welser, but it has them mashed and seasoned with expensive  spices. There is  very little similarity here. \n\nRecipe #87 obviously has nothing to do with peas at all. It describes  a type of pastry filling made of cooked egg that we find frequently in  this period. I suspect it gets described so much because it was either  new or foreign (or both), but I have yet to pin down an origin.\n\nRecipe #88  has parallels known as \u2018[rainworms made from peas](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/12/rainworms-made-of-peas/)\u2018 (also in [Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-Meister-Hans.pdf)  \\#204). The idea was to shape mashed peas into wormlike  shapes that  would be served with a sweet mustard flavouring. Here, the mush is  sweetened directly and the shape is described as *maden* which  today means exclusively maggots. Even though the meaning was   potentially broader at the time, it is not a word calculated to whet the  appetite. Colouring themn black as envisioned in Recipe #89 would  presumably not have helped. \n\nRecipes #90 and #91 use the mashed peas to make battered fritters.  This is not surprising in itself. It seems at times that there was [nothing medieval German cooks did not try to batter and fry](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/29/battering-and-frying-everything-de-rontzier/). But it is an interesting confirmation of a more detailed recipe in the Kuchenmaistrey that I included in [my Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook).   \n\nFinally, the same mass it used to prepare a cake, a solid mass cooked in a heated mortar with heat from above. Again, a [common ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/16/another-may-cake/)[technique ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/23/hemp-milk-cooking/)in  the Innsbruck MS. Apparently, there were few things  you could not do  with peas if you had to. We will see some more tomorrow.  \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.

Grind this to dust and then mix the  dust with egg whites, thus it will be white, or mix it with vinegar etc.***    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is not much to add here, other than that both cornflower blue  and eggshell white are more than figures of speech. The former can be  used to dye liquid foods like porridges or jellies. I suspect the latter  is not really suitable for that, but would work well actually painting  foods, something that people did in medieval kitchens of the upper  class. It would certainly be preferable to lead acetate and likely less  gritty than chalk at least. Eggshells are [still used in traditional painting](https://www.kremer-pigmente.com/de/shop/pigmente/11410-eierschalenweiss.html).\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

Cajanus cajan, better known as the pigeon pea, was also introduced along with lentils and chickpeas. The latter two influenced the cuisine of the region but they did not thrive as crops. Pigeon peas, on the other hand, became popular, and is arguably the most important introduced legume in the Caribbean.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s uncertain exactly how pigeon peas came to the Caribbean since the pea was well known in South East Asia and North East Africa. It might have come with slave ships or with the Portuguese and Spanish who used it as provisions on many of their vessels. In parts of the Caribbean, the name used for the pigeon pea bears some phonetic similarity to the original Bantu name. Examples of this include Gandule in Spanish, Guando in Portuguese, and Gungo in Jamaican English. The use of these names suggest that it was introduced by Bantu-speaking Africans living south of the Congo region, so it was likely slaves from that area that brought pigeon peas to the Caribbean. The popularity of this plant in the West Indies was due to its practicality; the plant was useful in multicropping systems, and the pea casing could be used as animal feed. In the eighteenth century, pigeon peas grew in popularity among subsistence farmers in the Caribbean and might have supplanted a local cultivar of the cowpea in culinary importance. Naturally, the pigeon pea can be found in several rice and legume dishes across the region.\r  \n\r  \nPelau is a one pot pigeon peas and rice dish from Trinidad and Tobago related to other one pot rice dishes like Paella from Spain, and Pulao from South India. What makes Pelau different from similar dishes is that sugar is first caramelized in the pot before other ingredients are added. These other ingredients might include items like pumpkin or poultry, both of which would have been present in the backyards of the enslaved.\r  \n\r  \nRice and Gungo Peas from Jamaica on the other hand could be considered to be rice and pigeon peas cooked in coconut milk that is seasoned with items like allspice berries, scallion, and thyme.\r  \n\r  \nArroz con Gandules from Puerto Rico is another variation of this dish that uses a base of olive oil and tomatoes sauteed into a spice blend called sofrito. Sofrito was possibly developed as a marinade that could be used to preserve meat, and often includes wild coriander, sweet pepper, and annatto.\r  \n\r  \nBahamian Peas n\u2019 Rice uses a similar sofrito as seasoning, but the finished dish is typically drier than the pigeon peas and rice made on the Hispanic islands while being more aromatic than versions from the rest of the English speaking Caribbean.\r  \nIt is important to recognize here that even within a single island, there is often strong debate about the proper way to make pigeon peas and rice, and across the entire Caribbean it becomes impossible to get any consensus."]}

They ate  fish jam.  \n\n \n\n[Pike \\(Esox lucius\\)](https://preview.redd.it/64fafcnp4hva1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3972b2e099bbda0afd9299b50d0274170e43fb71)\n\n***40 If you would make a good galantine (*****galrad*****) of a pike, boil the pike and chop the flesh. Then boil the flesh in wine and honey and turmeric (*****gelbwurtz*****). Boil this together until it can be poured like an electuary (*****latwargen*****) and do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis recipe is for a *galrad*, a word that can refer to  various kinds of preparation ranging from aspics to thick spicy sauces  and a kind of pickle. Here, it seems to mean a mixture of fish and honey  cooked down to a thick mush. Electuaries (*latwargen*), the  reference point for thickness, were typically cooked from mashed fruit,  sugar, or honey until they firmed up when cool. They were used as the  basis for sauces as well as being eaten in dessert courses. How the  category of *galrad* can encompass what is basically a  fish jam, or in what context this would have been eaten, I cannot say. \n\n \n\n[First experiment in fish jam](https://preview.redd.it/2a47d7ft4hva1.jpg?width=441&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9210c6d57f7104e489ab81ae55f9391d396d670)\n\nNow, there are [several recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/20/a-fish-recipe-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/) in [other sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/15/galantine-of-fish-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) that I have already written about and even [tried out with a modicum of success](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/26/the-galreit-experiment-number-one/).  I felt uncertain about the interpretation because though the recipe  occurs in three sources, it is clearly copied from the same original  text. However, the entry in the Innsbruck MS, while describing a very  similar dish, is not drawing on the same source as we can see when we  compare it to Cod Pal Germ 551:\n\n***23 Galantine (*****galreit*****) of fish***\n\n***If you would make galantine of fish of a pike, boil the pike nicely and take off its flesh (*****prat*****).  Then take honey and set it over the coals and let it boil and take the  flesh of the pike and pepper and sugar enough and stir it together,  neither too thin nor too thick, so that it can be poured onto a bowl  like an electuary. And do not oversalt it.***\n\nClearly, this is a real dish, not some copyist\u2019s mistake or  misinterpretation. It will take some playing around with the preparation  to see whether it produces something palatable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Turmeric](https://preview.redd.it/lt8lnfzz4hva1.jpg?width=489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3c6409f8e296789be40b2faa5851a62a7e8128b)\n\nThe other interesting aspect to the recipe in the Innsbruck MS, one that is not shared with the parallels, is the use of *gelbwurtz*.  The word is reasonably familiar by the fifteenth century from technical  literature, usually in the context of dyeing or painting. It refers to  turmeric (*Curcuma longa*), not, as it does today, [*Xanthoriza simplicissima*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowroot),  which is American in origin. As far as I know, this is the first  mention of it in a culinary context anywhere in the German corpus, and  it remains quite unusual for a long time. Yellow colouring is usually  achieved with the more expensive saffron. It does, however, raise the  question whether the ubiquitous single-verb imperative to \u201ccolour it  yellow\u201d (*gilbs*) left the choice at the cook\u2019s discretion.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12vdpn1/fish_galantine_with_turmeric_c_1450/", "created_utc": 1682185973.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/12vdpn1/fish_galantine_with_turmeric_c_1450/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

When it is melted, roll it out on a board  and put it into the pan so that the rounds are not too broad. Fry them  well again, thus they gain small bubbles (kluntzlein).

Clearly it is a choux pastry, and it is meant to be a very firm one since *gewolne k\u00fcchlein*  means rolled-out fritters. I started out with about 400ml of milk and  added a generous teaspoon of salt and a dollop of butter before bringing  it to boiling point. Beating in flour was challenging \u2013 the paste  quickly turned lumpy \u2013 and I think I did not add enough, but the  resulting dough still detached from the pot as a  choux is supposed to.  Then I worked in two eggs.\n\nSince the dough I got seemed unsuited for shaping or rolling, I divided  it in half and added more flour to half of it. Then I used the original  dough to make patties, but was unsuccessful and resorted to dropping it  from a spoon. This worked, but since I had also misjudged  the required  temperature the first batch burned and the second still came out too  brown. The actual fritters were  quite good, airy and moist, but we had  to prise the crumb out between the black crust and the undercooked  centre. Even if I had  done them at the right temperature, I don\u2019t think  that was what I was supposed to be aiming for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdyl9in7m6la1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be4928cccec8c935647564e343f8bdf97c6f9b7\n\nThe second batch went in at the correct temperature from the start, and  it was much more successful. I had been concerned over adding too much  flour, but the fritters still came out soft and airy with a slightly  crunchy crust. I started with a batch of relatively thick, flat rounds  and pressed the second one flatter and wider to see if it would make a  difference. The first patties took on [the shape I had thought they might](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/05/lamp-choux-fritters/):  an expanded rim and a  shallow dip in the middle that may explain the  name Liechtfesser \u2013 lamps \u2013 from their similarity to oil lamps.

This may make an interesting  experiment for the coming berry season, and perhaps I will have  found  references to a more general culinary use by then. It certainly makes me  wonder about the *pfeffertuch* and *brundoeck* other sources mention in passing. \n\nFranz de Rontzier, head cook to the bishop of Halberstadt and duke of Braunschweig, published his encyclopaedic *Kunstbuch von mancherley Essen* in 1598. He clearly looks to Marx Rumpolt\u2019s *New Kochbuch*  as the new gold standard, but fails to match it in engaging style or  depth. He is thus overshadowed by the twin peaks of Marx Rumpolt and  Anna Wecker. What makes his work interesting is the way in which he  systematically lists versions of a class of dishes, illustrating the  breadth or a court cook\u2019s repertoire. He is also more modernly  fashionable than Rumpolt.

Searce it through a colander (*****durchschlag*****) but (*****aber*****) let it become dry. Cut small pieces (*****pr\u00f6cklein*****). When it is dry, pound it in a mortar. Place it in a bowl, add clarified sugar and*** [**Trysanet** ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)***(a sweet spice mix) and make a dough as thick as for Ke\u00dfk\u00fcchlein. Also make a dough with water, roll out small rounds (*****pletzlein*****), place a piece of the (other) dough the size of a marble (*****einer schussers gro\u00df*****) into them and fry them in a*** **kachel** ***(a  shallow earthenware vessel). Or place them on a board and when the fire  in the oven is out, push the board in. That way they also bake. They  are supposed to be nicely white. If you do not wish to use clarified  sugar, you may well take the best kind of honey that is also clarified  and mix the gingerbread with that. These are good for (their) sugar and  spice.***\n\nThis is  an interesting recipe, though it is  very close to two [others ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/04/carnival-fritters/)that are less clear. As I read it, very dry [gingerbread ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/gingerbread-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-2/)is  ground to a  powder and mixed with additional spices and sugar to  produce a filling. The suggestion that both clarified sugar and honey  are  suitable as sweeteners  suggests that the sugar would have been  used in its [liquid state after refining ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/11/clarifying-sugar/)rather  than dried out again. This is then wrapped in a plain water crust in  pieces the size (and I  guess the shape) of a marble and fried or baked  at a gentle temperature to keep it from browning. The result could well  be quite attractive. \n\nInterestingly, there is another recipe quite close in time and space  to this one that also describes fritters as  being \u2018like marbles\u2019. It is  from the [recipe collection](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/fb05/germanistik/absprache/sprachverwendung/gloning/tx/sawe.htm) of [Sabina Welser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabina_Welserin)  dating to 1553  and likely written in Augsburg. These, of course, are  savoury, made with  cheese, identified as coming from Nuremberg and \u2013  like our parallel recipe from this book \u2013 associated with carnival:\n\n***173*** ***How people customarily make*** **krapfen** ***in Nuremberg for Carnival***\n\n***Grate parmesan cheese, or another kind that is nicely  dry, break eggs into it and also take a little fine wheat flour so it  does not become too crunchy with the cheese. Make this firm enough so it  does not flow away. Then make an egg dough as for a tart, make long,  narrow sheets of it and place in the middle of the sheet little pieces  of the cheese mixture, as large as you like them, with a spoon. Fold it  over and press it together with two thumbs, each sheet well in place  with its filling, then cut them apart with a metal sheet. When you want  to bake them, do not let the fat get very hot, but place many of them in  the pan when it is barely melted. Fry them slowly and shake the pan  well, then they will become like marbles.***\n\nThis is clearly not the same recipe, not even close. One is a  run-of-the-mill cheese fritter in a rich egg dough, the other a sweet  confection. At the same time, the connections are so blatant they almost  look like they had been written for a treasure hunt. There is the  comparison to marbles, the association (admittedly at one remote) with  carnival, and of course the fact that they show up in two recipe  collections dated six years apart and from the same city. As an aside,  between these two and the Stengler collection, mid-century Augsburg may  be the best documented place in Renaissance Germany for cooking recipes.  \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

Put it on a plate and cut it into pieces like rolled fritters (*****gewolne kuechlein*****), lay those in a pan and fry them like other fritters.***\n\nThis is another variation on the theme of frying eggs, milk and  flour. This time, you first prepare a thick pancake that is made fluffy  by applaying heat from above. This cake is then sliced (on the  assumption that *gewolne k\u00fcchlein* is broadly the same thing as *angestrichens* in  other sources and thus also cut into strips) and fried in fat.

Hence Marx Rumpolt:\n\n***Make a dough of milk, eggs and good white flour, add some  brewer\u2019s yeast to it and make a good dough, not too stiff. Do not  oversalt it. Leave it in a warm place to rise\u2026 (there follows a raisin  fritter recipe)***\n\n***Take such a dough and roll it out, wrap cherry sauce in  it, cut it up with a pastry wheel, deep-fry it in butter and serve it  warm, sprinkled with sugar. These are good*** **Krapfen** ***of cherry sauce. You can make them with all kinds of sauces.***\n\n(Rumpolt, Gebackens #41 and 42)\n\nThis is basically how we still make Berliner. *Krapfen* by the  lights of the sixteenth century meant all kinds of filled dough  pockets, usually deep-fried, but also boiled or baked. The use of  leavened and enriched yeast dough with a sweet filling (the [ubiquitous ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/27/a-cherry-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/)and [popular ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/22/cherry-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)[cherry ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/06/cherry-sauce-from-section-two-of-cod-pal-germ-551/))  sets this recipe apart. Today, Berliner are usually filled with jam,  but also with alcoholic confections, chocolate spread, and \u2013 by  tradition \u2013 one of each batch with mustard. Like their close relative,  the donut, they have entered a spiral of escalating adornment with  coloured frostings, sprinkles, and other fanciful additions, but the  traditional style is still either powdered sugar or a plain glaze.  Berliner are traditionally circular and quite possibly always have been.  A foldover shape is known as a *Tasche*, and usually filled with things like marzipan or fruit preserves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pyhp6m7za9a1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=413a1e0e0137b3b30965ac80c8474517db8bda3b\n\nThe Berliner has become part of modern folklore and integrated into the time *zwischen den Jahren*  though, like the donut, it is today available year-round. Its most  famous appearance on the international stage was in the aftermath of  President Kennedy\u2019s famous speech at the Sch\u00f6neberger Rathaus in West  Berlin. Contrary to the popular urban legend, his words \u201c[*Ich bin ein Berliner*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner)\u201d  were not misinterpreted by his audience. In Berlin itself, they are  known only as Pfannkuchen. Neither is the sentence grammatically wrong \u2013  unlike \u201c*Ich bin Berliner*\u201c, it is ambiguous, but clear from the context. Kennedy likely added the indefinite article *ein* to parallel the correct translation of the Ciceronian *civis Romanus sum*  he was referencing in his speech. Classical education was ubiquitous  enough in 1963 for listeners to have faulted him for failing to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loy2mveeza9a1.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d82c2c59d52be78c662d4c4e5c63d4590ccb5f6\n\nModern Berliner recipes do not differ materially from the 1581  version, though they are usually more detailed and precise. The 1891 [Davidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Davidis)\\-Holle Praktisches Kochbuch has instructions for making them in the classic fashion:\n\n***196. Berliner Pfannkuchen (Krapfen). For the dough, 1/4 l  milk, 250g clarified butter, 1 egg and 5 yolks, 50g yeast, 50g sugar, a  teaspoon of salt and 1/2 kg of fine flour. Further to fill them, any  kind of preserve: three-fruit*** **mus**, ***currants, cherries, jelly that is no very firm, of best of all, a fine fruit jam.***\n\n***Flour and butter are warmed before beginning. Then the  eggs are beaten and the lukewarm milk is mixed in along with the yeast,  butter, sugar and salt and made into a light dough with the flour. This  is beaten until it throws bubbles and no longer sticks to the spoon.  Then it is placed on a floured board to rise slowly. Once this is done,  it is rolled out half a finger thick and you use a teaspoon to lay on  preserves without liquid or a fine jam of apricots, skinned plums etc.  on the dough in rows about 7cm from the edge and at about similar  distance from each other. You fold the edge of the dough over the fruit  always grasping it with both hands, and press it together all round the  elevations formed by the fruit using the tips of your fingers. \u2013 Now you  cut rounds with a cookie cutter or a glass and lay them on boards or  pieces of paper that are dusted with flour to let them rise in the  warmth. Meanwhile, heat butterfat (Schmelzbutter) to a high heat (kochend hei\u00df) and let the*** **Kuchen** ***fry  in it one after the other, floating on one side, as many at a time as  will fit. Further proceed as described before (the previous entry  describes general procedure for frying leavened doughs). The*** **Pfannkuchen** ***must  attain a dark yellow colour and are rolled in powdered sugar while  still hot, strewn with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar, or which is  finer still, covered in a glaze of your choice. They are eaten fresh.***\n\nThere is very little to add to this. Other than first cutting out the  rounds and then adding the jam, this is how I make mine. Bakers  producing larger quantities usually inject the jam after cooking, using  an electric pump. That leaves holes in the side which sometimes betray  the filling \u2013 not a problem as such, but it can spoil the surprise if  you have a mixed batch.\n\nHappy New Year 2023.

Do not cook it long, otherwise it will curdle.***\n\n***25 A Good Soup for Sick People***\n\n***Take an egg and boil it in wine. When it has boiled, pour off the wine, take the egg and take out the yolk. Force it (*****zwing** ***\u2013  mash it?), pour wine on it and make a soup. Thus a person regains  flesh. An old man said so who had become thin and lost much weight, but a  doctor made him such a soup every morning and he became fat (faist) and gained weight again.***\n\nMany recipe collections include dishes specifically for sick people,  and these are all fairly typical for the age. Eggs, chicken meat, and  wine were all considered strengthening and healthful. In recipe #23,  chicken is creativbely combined with plum (most likely dried prunes  rather than fresh fruit) into fritters. They are held together with *semelmeel* which most likely means the bolted white flour used for making *semmel* loaves,  but today refers to grated bread and may possibly already mean that.  Recipes #24 and #25 are for egg yolk liaison soups. These are described  so often that I suspect the dish was simply fashionable at the time. The  second one goes about it in a rather convoluted way, first soft-boiling  the egg and extracting the yolk (a common trick used in [making ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/13/stuffed-eggs-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[*krosseier*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/11/filled-eggs-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)),  finally using that yolk to make a soup. To me, that suggests a degree  of magical thinking. Someone had success with this method, and now one  must be sure to follow it every time to get the same result.\n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.  Despite its brevity, it is interesting especially as it contains many  recipes for *k\u00fcchlein*, baked or deep-fried confections, that  apparently played a significant role in displaying status.

But to celebrate  my nose clearing up, here are two scented sauces. Like the earlier [plum sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/23/plum-sauce-from-the-kuenstlichs-und-fuertrefflichs-kochbuch/),  they are brought to the table warm in a covered dish and opened on  serving with a flourish to give the recipient the full benefit of their  odour. To get the timing right \u2013 soon enough for the sauce to be  properly heated, not too long so the scent does not dissipate \u2013 must  have been a challenge for the cook. Again, the scent is produced with  spices \u2013 cinnamon and the ubiquitous [*Trisanet* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)mix  \u2013 and distilled waters, in this case rosewater and lavender water.  There is no mention of grating the orange peel in recipe #21, something  that most modern cooks would likely do. This may simply not have occured  to the author, or the state oranges, still a [relative novelty and luxury](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/21/bitter-orange-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/),  arrived north of the Alps made it impractical. Citrus fruit can be  stored for a very long time and still be juiced, but the skin tends to  dry out fairly quickly. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

I have never made one with fish  livers, but do not assume it will be fundamentally different from  poultry liver, which I have done. The interesting points in this recipe  are two asides, things that the reader is simply assumed to know. \n\nFirstly, there is the reference to *gebrentem mell*, toasted  or, literally, burned flour. In later sources, this term refers to a  roux, flour heated with fat and used to thicken sauces. This is also  what it is used for here \u2013 either grated gingerbread, or \u2018toasted  flour\u2019. We have a good idea of how to use grated bread to thicken a  sauce, but a roux in the mid-fifteenth century, while not completely  unprecedented, would be unusual. Since there is no further description  here, we must leave this standing as a possible reference. \n\nThe second point is *bayderlay winber*, the raisins of both  kinds. This is another of those many references to different kinds of  raisins that I have yet to fill with any substance. I know that several  terms were in use and that cooks would have understood what *welsche Rosinen*, *Meertr\u00e4ubel*, or *wei\u00dfe Rosinen*  were. Now we know that at least in this corner of Germany, in the  mid-fifteenth century, there were two kinds of raisins. That helps a  little. \n\nBound together with medicinal, veterinary, and magical texts, the  culinary recipes of Munich Cgm 384 were partly published in 1865 as \u201cEin  alemannisches B\u00fcchlein von guter Speise\u201c.

They are, however, clearly different and complement rather than repeat the first. This is not always the case in medieval recipe collections where dishes and instructions are often duplicated.\n\nThe preparations themselves are not complicated. In recipe #168, the birds are boiled and served in a honey-mustard sauce. This is also how small songbirds were sometimes cooked. Recipe #169 has them boiled with bacon and served in their broth, much like boiled chickens were, while #170 is for a galantine (*galreid*). That termn can refer to either a thickened sauce or an aspic, but in this case it clearly means the latter. The actual instructions are so cursory that we cannot reconstruct the dish beyond the most basic level.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus.

Here, it is given a bland, descriptive name. Another way the three differ is in describing the consistency aimed for. Here, it is *gestuffelt* which means poached eggs. The Mondseer Kochbuch had *get\u00fcfftelnt* which makes little sense but I thought might be a badly corrupted version of the phrase for scrambled eggs. In truth, the scribe might not have understood. Meister Hans simply has foilled eggs, a different class of recipes entirely and a likely response to the writer not understanding an original they were working from.\n\nNote I am not saying the Dorotheenkloster MS recipe was the basis for the Mondseer one which was copied into Meister Hans.

The one for roast peas [especially ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/08/another-roast-peas-recipe-from-meister-eberhard/)[occurs ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/11/roast-pease-pudding-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)across [many ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/11/failed-roast-peas-from-meister-hans/)[sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/14/roasted-peas-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/), often with the rather baffling instruction to use equal quantities of eggs and peas. The one for millet [only shows up in Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/03/a-lenten-feast-in-2021/), where it is a little less clear than here. They are interesting to try, with a good deal of potential for error, and for what they do.\n\nCereal porridges and legumes were the plainest, least excitinbg dishes in the medieval kitchen and especially beans and peas carried associations of humility. That explains why [so much effort](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/29/all-about-peas-part-one/) [went into making them](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/30/all-about-peas-part-two/) [appealing to wealthy patrons.](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/25/how-to-serve-peas/) Here, we can see the playbook very clearly: Process the food, add animal protein (eggs), and produce Maillard flavours.

And take all manner of fish roe, except barbel roe, and pound that in a mortar with a little flour so that it turns out like a strauben batter (a type of leavened fritter). Colour that and pour it on the fladen and bake it in an oven.***\n\nFladen are mentioned frequently in surviving sources and we have some recipes for what they probably looked like.

In place of the minced meat topping, we have mortared fish roe and the rather mysterious boiled raisins and party coloured almonds are added as a topping. The base would simply be the standard kind of dough used to make meat fladen, but since we do not really know what that was, we can [use our imagination](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/07/25/a-meat-fladen-experiment/).\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

You also do this with trout, salmon, and all other fish.***\n\nDespite the title, this recipe has general instructions for making fish pastries. You can make them with the expensive and prestigious pike, but the less exalted salmon and trout and indeed \u201call other fish\u201d are fine, too. From a culinary perspective, it sounds enticing \u2013 parsley and sage in vinegar with notes of pepper, ginger, and caraway (or cumin) should work fine with fish, though they are going to overpower and subtle note. I doubt you would notice the saffron except by colour.\n\nIncidentally, it is unclear whether the word *k\u00fcmmel* in recipes this early refers to cumin or caraway. In modern German, it always means caraway (cumin is *Kreuzk\u00fcmmel*), but that usage is not established until well after 1500.\n\nI am not sure whether this is meant as a way of providing portable food, but pastries often were and this would work well. Cutting the fish into portion-sized pieces and baking them in a case of stiff, dense dough would produce durable and convenient supplies for an outing or a short journey.

Take veal and chop it, and with it fat of an ox and all manner of good herbs. When they are chopped, take 4 eggs and mace and a little saffron. Stir it together and put it into the breast. Lay it into good meat broth and let it boil in a tart pan or in an earthenware pan. You have them (tart pans) made with lids, they are better than earthenware ones. Therefore, this is a good dish.***\n\nNot every historical recipe needs to be complex, odd, or confusing. This one is completely in line with every modern expectation and will produce an absolutely delicious result to feed a small crowd. You take a breast of veal, fill it with a forcemeat of veal, fat, herbs, and eggs seasoned with salt and mace and coloured with saffron. The latter is perhaps the one thing we would omit. The meat is then slowly cooked in meat broth with heat from above and below. If this is done right, not too fast, and not using too much liquid, the resulting meat is tender and intensely flavourful. If you are not feeding a small crowd, you can also use the same filling to roll up in veal cutlets to make *Rouladen*.\n\nTart pans, originally designed as miniature baking ovens, were used for all kinds of culinary applications. They are in every respect the ancestor of the Dutch oven, though they were typically made of pottery or sheet metal, not cast iron. Their lids were shaped to hold coals to provide top heat, and a good cook could regulate this very precisely. Very few kitchens had ovens in the sixteenth century, and even where one was at hand, heating it was a lenghthy and expensive undertaking. Any small baked goods such as cakes, tarts, biscuits, or pastries would be made in a tart pan unless the oven was in use anyway.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe.

Cut them thinly lengthwise as though for a gescherb (vegetable or fruit sauce). Take a piece of fat the size of an egg and fry the onions well, but do not let them burn. Pour in some (struck out: milk) wine and let it boil up. Then lay in the roe and take saffron and sugar and spices, but no cloves. Let it boil well and serve it in the broth.***\n\nThis is an interesting dish, not least because it provides hints at portion sizes \u2013 it is quite small. The name is somewhat enigmatic. The word *ko rech* could be a variation of *gericht*, a dish, but it is very gard to see how this would come about in the dialect of this source. Alternatively, *rech* could be *Reh*, roe deer, but there is little about the dish that suggests venison. I really do not know what to make of it at this point.\n\nThe dish, on the other hand, is fairly straightforward and easy enough to reconstruct with some confidence. We need the roe of one carp \u2013 less easy to source today than it would have been then \u2013 and three onions for the sauce. The onions are sliced as though for a *gescherb*. That name referred to sauces or side dishes made by slowly cooking sliced vegetables and fruit \u2013 often onions and apples or pears \u2013 until they fell apart. The same technique is used here. The Onions are fried in fat, then cooked in wine. We are not given a time, but I assume it would be long enough for them [to soften into](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/11/onion-sauce-for-lords-and-commoners/) [a sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/13/onion-sauce-for-small-fish/). Afterwards, spices are added and the whole \u2013 clearly liquid and still plentiful enough for that \u2013 used as a cooking sauce for the roe.\n\nTaking into account that both onions and eggs were very likely smaller in 1550 than they are today, this gives us a good starting point for actually making a dish as it went to the table in the Welser household. I am not sure whether this would have functioned as a side dish for a company of diners, a main dish for one, or a dainty part of a sequence of courses, but it cannot have been enough to feed many guests on its own.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

It was intended for small freshwater fish, but I suspect it will be excellent with pilchards or whitebait as well.

[Dishes from countries to the east](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/17/bohemian-and-hungarian-sauce-recipes/) generally seem to have carried some cachet, and contacts between the German and Polish upper classes were close.\n\nThis recipe is unsurprising for sixteenth-century upper-class cuisine. It is unclear how thick the eventual cooking liquid is meant to be \u2013 wine, just flavoured with apple and onion, or a mash of apples and onions (a sauce otherwise known as a ziseindel) cooked in wine \u2013 but the overall flavour profile is clear: fruity, slightly sweet, with a strong spice aroma.

Boil that in a pot with water or wine, about 3 seytla (a Seidel is somewhere between 0.35 and 0.7 litres), depending on how large the pike is. Then take the pike and scale it well, cut it into pieces, wash them well, put them in a bowl and salt them. Let them lie in it (the salt) for half an hour, then take the broth with roots and all and pour it on the fish. Boil it well, and when it is half boiled, try it for salt. It must be salted lightly (len gesaltzen). Then take a good pierce of butter and cut it into (the cooking liquid), and add as much pepper as for a dish of crawfish, but do not make it too hot (resch). Put it back over the fire and let it boil fully. See that there is not much broth in it. Then toast slices of semel bread and serve the fish on them. If you have too much broth, do not pour it all over the dish, only enough to moisten the bread slices.***\n\nThis is not a very exciting recipe, but potentially quite an attractive one. Of course it is a high-status dish \u2013 fresh fish were not cheap, and pike among the most costly. But it is neither overly complex nor overloaded with luxury ingredients.\n\nIn principle, it is a simple dish. A broth is prepared with parsley roots, lightly salted fish cooked in it and further seasoned with pepper and enriched with butter. The fish, once fully cooked, is served on toasted slices of fine, white bread with its cooking liquid. It is entirely credible that there are steps left out that would be obvious to the writer; perhaps the sauce was slightly thickened or other spices added to the parsley at the beginning. But the basic approach is clear.\n\nWhat is striking about it and sets it apart from much of the other material in this collection is the care with which the unknown author approaches the dish: Care not to oversalt, not to overcook the fish, not to use too much pepper, not to end up with too much liquid. It is, in a way, a very modern instruction and suggests that these things, though often unmentioned, were very much part of a culinary education and familiar to a competent cook.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

and my poems\n\nHave all come to nought\n\nBefore, I had in mind only\n\nJoy and lovemaking\n\nBut householding has converted me\n\nAnd taught me truly\n\nThat I must leave behind love\n\nI have entered another live\n\nThat is certainly true:\n\nMy beard grows and my hair is turning grey\n\nI am getting quite old\n\nBut not (too old) for a householder\n\nNow I think of salt\n\nAnd I fret over lard (*smalz*).\n\nAnd pots and casks\n\nYou will find few with me.\n\nOf buckets and pitchers\n\nI do not have enough.\n\nVats and ladles\n\nI need not pay dues on (i.e. I have too few).\n\nBoth bowls and spoons\n\nYou will rarely hear clattering\n\nAround my hearth\n\nI feel this lack acutely.\n\nSpit and griddle\n\nI have long done without\n\nStone(ware) pots (*Havenstein*) and poker\n\nI have none to show\n\nKettlehook and firedogs\n\nHave left me.\n\nPepper mill and stone mortar\n\nI have none anywhere.\n\nBellows, trivet and iron grater,\n\nI have to beg for those.\n\nVinegar crock and saltcellar -\n\nI need to recollect what that even is.\n\nBenches, chairs, seats,\n\nHarps (*rotten*, *harpfen*) and fiddles\n\nYou hear little of from me.\n\nI do without these things.\n\nOf earthen pots and pitchers\n\nWashbowl and ewer\n\nSmall pitchers, small pots (*kruoselin*) and glasses\n\nYou see few in my house\n\nBecause they have all fled it.\n\nNeither table nor trestle[^(1)](#sdfootnote1sym)\n\nDo I have anywhere.\n\nFrom good towels and tablecloths,\n\nI am quite safe.\n\nIf I could make blankets and bedsheets\n\nBy myself\n\nI would make enough of them\n\nAnd put the ell\n\nOver linen cloth.\n\nBut my shirt and breeches\n\nAre torn everywhere\n\nI am often shamed for that.\n\nMattresses, pillows and beds,\n\nIf I had many of them\n\nThat would make a fine bedroom.\n\nThough I never gained any worldly good\n\nFrom any friend (female form: *fr\u00fcndinne*)\n\nI will be silent about this.\n\nBut first I will tell you my sorrow\n\nAnd tell you another thing\n\nOf the great suffering\n\nThat has entered my home:\n\nI tell you that the sheep\n\nDo not rob me of my sleep\n\nNeither goats nor cows\n\nRequire my effort\n\nDucks, chickens, or geese\n\nDon\u2019t cause me trouble\n\nNeither piglets nor young pigs\n\nSqueal in my home.\n\nThat is why under my roof\n\nYou rarely see meat hanging.\n\nChickpeas and peas,\n\nhowever much I struggled,\n\nI could not acquire\n\nFor I had nothing to buy them with.\n\nOats, spelt, groats,\n\nWould be very useful to me\n\nIf I had them in my house.\n\nNothing will remain in it.\n\nThat I had figs, almonds, or rice\n\nThat would be quite unknown to me.\n\n(Even) Chard and cabbage\n\nHave fled from my home.\n\nParsley and leeks,\n\nThe cuckoo has cried over (i.e. have grown prematurely)\n\nSo now I have none.\n\nThus it is with me:\n\nRoot vegetables and onions\n\nI have no plenty of.\n\nAnd nobody can ask me\n\nFor dried pears or for lentils.\n\nFruit from the garden\n\nI can expect little\n\nI have already lost it\n\nThe worms have eaten it.\n\nThe good food of the K\u00fcnig (i.e. that this poet usually writes about)\n\nIs quite unknown to me\n\nThough I would like to enjoy it\n\nI am ruled by poverty.\n\nIt is also quite rare\n\nThat my cat lies by the fire.\n\nWhere my fire should be\n\nLies my dog who is called *Grin* (\u2018barker\u2019)\n\nMy cat is called *Zise* (\u2018siskin\u2019)\n\nMy kitchen boy *Wise* (\u2018clever\u2019)\n\nMy horse is called *Kern* (\u2018breadgrain\u2019)\n\nIt does not like to fight.\n\nIf I am called on to go to battle\n\nIt does not like to go there at all.\n\nMy kitchen maid is called *Metze* (referring to a woman of low status and moral standing)\n\nShe always fusses with a rag\n\nAnd has a very old skin (i.e. is old).\n\nShe would rather take care of porridge flour\n\nThan take care of beans\n\nBecause she wants to spare her teeth.\n\nShe has less than the chaff\n\nTwo cats and two mice\n\nCould not live on it\n\nUnless they were very economical indeed.\n\nIt is to my dishonour\n\nI must furrow my brow greatly\n\nWhen guests come to my home\n\nIt is no good to me.\n\nThough I would like to feed them well\n\nIf poverty let go of me.\n\nFish, meat, bread, and wine,\n\nI must mourn all of them.\n\nI am always worn down by worry\n\nAs soon as day begins in my house\n\nI feel great sorrow.\n\nIt is the same in heaven:\n\nIf you bring something with you, you fare better\n\nFor there is neither this nor that (i.e. nothing) there.\n\nWhatever is suited for household goods,\n\nFlees from my house soon.\n\nYou should also know certainly:\n\nIt is smoky in my house\n\nAs though two men were forging a pickaxe\n\nThis can well displease me\n\nAnd I am sad about it.\n\nThe clothes on the stand (*gericke*)\n\nSadly are very thin\n\nMy joy and all my pleasure\n\nAre in the hands of a beloved maiden\n\nWhat I mourned sorrowfully\n\nShe can give me if she wants to\n\nSo that I may live joyfully.\n\nShe soon gives me possessions\n\nSoon gives me tender hope\n\nOf love and of desire\n\nOpen and concealed.\n\nThe more she gives this to me\n\nThe more I think of her\n\nBecause a joyful hope guides me\n\nThat I may expect good (material) things (from her).\n\nWith her looks, she can\n\nLiberate and unbind me.\n\nWhat good does it do me to always complain?\n\nI will tell you a different story now:\n\nNothing but the powerful faith\n\nin my beloved nourishes me\n\nWithout it, I would surely die.\n\nOh Lord God, protect me\n\nAnd guard me in this sinful life\n\nUntil I pass into another\n\nBut love that makes a man die\n\nIs good for nothing.\n\nHere ends the tale of household goods\n\nOf which a rich man has enough.\n\nIt truly ends here,\n\nMay God send us better gear\n\nThan the poor man had in his life\n\nWho is described above\n\nSo that we improve so much\n\nThat we need not have complained\n\nWhether man nor woman nor child.\n\nNow fill the cups and let us drink!\n\nAnd let the lame stumble along (i.e. walk at all)\n\nAnd the blind see.\n\nTo this end, may the poem help me. Amen.\n\nFirst of all, this is a satirical inversion of the tropes of courtly love. Instead of dedicating himself selflessly to the pursuit of an idealised noblewoman, the author openly declares his material interest: He wants a rich female patron, a woman he can woo in the hope of generous gifts. It is hard to know how common this kind of arrangement was, but it certainly cannot have been unknown if it gets such literary treatment.\n\nThe topic of the poem, too, is interesting. Rhyming lists of household goods, usually describing an idealised urban home, are common in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, but they are very much a product of cities, produced and consumed by burghers, not nobles. That this poem could be written in a courtly context in the fourteenth century suggests the genre was already familiar enough to subvert.\n\nWhat the author describes here is, of course, a very genteel kind of poverty. He has a change of clothes and a rack to hang them, a house, servants, furniture, and even a horse. No peassant living in such circumstances would be accounted poor, but by the lights of the class the work is addressed at, this was abject destitution. Typically, the later household poems are aspirational, describing a comfortable level of material wealth that most people could never hope to achieve. The things that the author here laments missing are very much what they lovingly describe. This is an excerpt from a poem by Hans Folz of Nuremberg dating to about 1500 (quoted after Bach: The Kitchen, Food and Cooking in Reformation Germany, 2016):\n\n**\u201c\u2026*****Everyone must consider that to have a quiet marriage, he must have what is needful of household equipment. Chairs and benches for the living room, remember this well, tables, tablecloths, towels and handwashing pitcher, washbasin, sideboard, beer glasses,*** **k\u00f6pf** ***(smooth and round) and*** **kra\u00fcs** ***(knobbed), to drink from, that is well found. Pitchers and bottles, a cooler, bowl stands, dishwashing brush and dishrag, candleholders, snuffer and extinguisher, spoons and saltcellar, an*** **Engster** ***glass and*** **Kuttrolf** ***bottle with a funnel for it. \\[\u2026\\]***\n\n***When you then go into the kitchen, this kind of equipment is very fitting: Pots, pitchers, kettles and pans, trivet and spit you must also have, bellows and griddle are also common, a baking pan and oven pipe. \\[\u2026\\] a pitcher of vinegar, pure and clear, mortar, pestle, fire fork, chopping board and chopping knife. A skimmer, seething pan and poker to push together the embers, a broom must be in a corner, a panczer fleck (piece of mail) with which you scrub away the dirt. Stirring spoons and a saltcellar, serving bowls and plates large and small, chopping board and scraper must not be missing. Firestriker and sulfur quickly make a fire with some dry wood to go along.***\n\n***\\[\u2026\\]***\n\n***As I go into the wine cellar, wine, beer, sauerkraut, apple puree, according to whether one is rich or poor, pay good heed and strive well that you do not lack these things. A basket of eggs must also be to hand,a basket for bread, one for cheese, a hanger for pots, root vegetables as one is accustomed, good electuaries, and you must also have in your care all manner of spices.***\n\n***\\[\u2026\\]***\n\n***What else we find in the chest*** **\\[in the master bedroom\\]** ***of gingerbread, electuaries and confits and things that one enjoys eating, and silver tableware, unless I am wrong, stands alongside them freely.***\n\n***\\[\u2026\\]***\n\n***In the pantry you must have bread, salt, cheese and lard above all, fish, meat, peas, lentils and beans, rice, millet, barley, too, oats for porridge and wheaten flour, lime, chives, garlic and onions, chickens, ducks, geese and pigeons, bacon and radish so that one may have the best when it is custom.\u201d***\n\nI know of no similar piece from the fourteenth century, but this is clearly what the K\u00f6nig is mocking here.\n\nDer K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald (literally king of the Odenwald, a mountain chain in southern Germany) is an otherwise unknown poet whose work is tentatively dated to the 1340s. His title may refer to a senior rank among musicians or entertainers, a Spielmannsk\u00f6nig, but that is speculative. Many of his poems are humorous and deal with aspects of everyday life which makes them valuable sources to us today.\n\nThe identity of this poet has been subject to much speculation. He is clearly associated with the episcopal court at W\u00fcrzburg and likely specifically with Michael de Leone (c. 1300-1355), a lawyer and scholar. Most of his work is known only through the Hausbuch of the same Michael de Leone, a collection of verse and practical prose that also includes the first known instance of the Buoch von guoter Spise, a recipe collection. This and the evident relish with which he describes food have led scholars to consider him a professional cook and the author of the Buoch von Guoter Spise, but that is unlikely. Going by the content of his poetry, the author is clearly familiar with the lives of the lower nobility and even his image of poverty is genteel.

{"title": "Blanc Manger by yet another name (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/11/blancmanger-by-yet-another-name/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/11/blancmanger-by-yet-another-name/)\n\nI\u2019ve been kept busy by life, but it\u2019s all good. Today, there is time for a short recipe from the collection of Philippine Welser:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l2804z0s7od1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca73f91b6699c780dc224d1bf3b128f00ee0d875\n\n***155 If you want to make sugar*** **Mus**\n\n***Take rice flour and milk and put that into a brass pan.

When it has softened, pass it through a cloth together with the eggs and add half a pound of sugar. Make it with cream so it has its proper thickness and set it in the cellar. That is well done.***\n\nThe first recipe is interesting not so much because of what it tells us as because of what it lascks. Again, we have a recipe for what is clearly blancmanger that is called something else. I wrote about this earlier when discussing the [parallel recipes from the *Buoch von guoter Spise* that uses the term *blamensir* and the Mondseer Kochbuch, which calls it *pulverisei*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/21/blancmanger-by-any-other-name/). A similar issue showed up with a [recipe of uncertain reading in the same sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/12/a-misspelling-or-whey-blanc-manger/). Again, here is a German language source, this one over 100 years later, that records a blancmanger but calls it something very different. The name had not dropped from use \u2013 [Marx Rumpolt uses the Italian *Manscho Blancko* in 1581](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/08/turkey-recipes-from-rumpolt/) \u2013 but here, it is clearly not familiar. What is more, the name of \u2018sugar mus\u2019 the dish is given is quite generic, and a folloowing recipe names a completely different preparation the same. I begin to get the feeling that neither names nor specific preparations were very soundly established in German kitchens. As with the [infamous heidnische Kuchen](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/14/infidel-cake-from-the-mondseer-kochbuch/), we are walking on shifting sands here.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1fefqqm/blanc_manger_by_yet_another_name_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1726075293.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1fefqqm/blanc_manger_by_yet_another_name_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "A 'Ragged' Mus (c. 1550)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/06/ragged-mus-a-milk-pasta/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/06/ragged-mus-a-milk-pasta/)\n\nToday, it\u2019s another short recipe from the collection of Philippine Welser, but a very interesting one:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cucivtyhe8nd1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57e0a28f7a214a54c4be8d2a097323403b1bca52\n\n***162 If you want to make a ragged Mus (hader mu\u00df)***\n\n***Take an egg or 2 for 8 portions (barschonen). Prepare a fine dough like a (omission), roll it out make it into nicely thick sheets. Then sprinkle flour on it and coat it well. Fold it six or eight times, depending on how large it is, and cut off thin strips (lit. small feathers, federla). Fry the same crispy and when they are fried, put it into boiling milk at once. Stir it so it does not burn and add sugar. You can also scrape nutmeg into it.***\n\nThis recipe straddles the boundary between two kinds of dishes we find elsewhere: the genre of milk pasta often called a [\u2018shaggy\u2019 Mus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/23/shaggy-mus-milk-pasta/), and that of [fritters cooked](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/22/little-fritters-in-sauce/) [in sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/30/fritters-maybe-in-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/). These dishes seem to have been quite popular, and it is easy to see why.\n\nThe name is imaginative and evocative; *hader* are rags, torn pieces of cloth, and the unevenly ragged, stringy appearance that this dish would have matches this very well. A similar dish found in several fifteenth-century sources was known as [*zottet mus*, a shaggy dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/23/shaggy-mus-milk-pasta/). The version from the Innsbruck MS reads:\n\n***25 If you would make a shaggy Mus (zottet m\u00fcez), make sheets of dough that are thin, and then cut them so they are as small as small rings. Fry them in fat so they are not very brown and then cook them in good milk. Serve it and add fat etc.***\n\nThe version from the Dorotheenkloster MS, which I adapted for a redaction in my Landsknecht Cookbook, omits the frying:\n\n***Take good white flour and make a dough with egg white. Have boiling milk ready in a pan and pull the dough into little pieces, throwing them in as the milk boils. It is to be salted beforehand. Also add fat. See that it stays worm-shaped. Do not oversalt it. Serve it.***\n\nThe shape seems to have been very variable, with the pasta being [chopped in Balthasar Staindl ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/23/shaggy-mus-milk-pasta/)and cut [in the Oeconomia](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/07/milk-pasta-from-the-oeconomia/). What was aimed for was an uneven appearance, a kind of heap or tangle of the pasta in the milk. I assume that the aim was to cook the noodles fairly dry, mushy, but cohesive, with most of the liquid absorbed. That is how I like it best, at least.\n\nAll of these \u2018shaggy\u2019 dishes make excellent breakfast food by modern sensibilities, though there is no reason not to serve them as a side or dessert with a hearty winter meal. The tradition had a long life, and [*Milchnudeln* ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milchnudeln)survive as a childhood treat especially in the east of Germany. It is intuitive to us to serve them sweetened, but do try them plain, with salt. You will be surprised at how well that works.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Following fruit, this addresses herbs and vegetables. I suspect the two parts may have been seen as belonging together.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucgq5gey8umd1.jpg?width=2297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c922afbba40ccca2bf0ad143b2033c466cdaa8f5\n\n**203 May the cross cause these radishes to have a sweet taste**\n\n***Gustu radices faciat crux has fore dulces***\n\n**204 May the Lord let this kind of seed give health**\n\n***Seminis hanc speciem dominus det ferre salutem***\n\n**205 May Christ make these cabbage seeds lighten the stomach**\n\n***Hoc holeris semen stomacho fac Christe levamen***\n\n**206 May this medicine be blessed under the holy cross**\n\n***Sub cruce divina benedicta sit h\u0119c medicina***\n\n**207 May the highest giver expel all bitterness from this herb**\n\n***Summus ab hac erba dator omnia pellat acerba***\n\n**208 May the fruit of the gardens be blessed by the holy cross**\n\n***Hortorum fructus sancta cruce sit benedictus***\n\n**209 May God who creates all good things bless this cabbage**\n\n***Hoc benedicat holus qui cuncta creat bona solus***\n\n**210 May the cross render the cooked and the raw leeks free from fever**\n\n***Coctos seu crudos Porros crux det febre nudos***\n\n**211 May blessing fill the mushrooms boiled many times**\n\n***S\u0119pius elixos repleat benedictio fungos***\n\n**212 May the blessing make all kinds of cabbage agreeable**\n\n***Caules omnigenas faciat benedictio sanas***\n\n**213 Mighty Christ, place your sign upon these melons**\n\n***Christe potens pones super hos tua signa pepones***\n\n**214 May the garlic give weakened stomachs their customary strength**\n\n***Virtutem stomachis solitam dent allia lassis***\n\n**215 But may it not give the kidneys thousands of stones**\n\n***Sed non millenas renibus operentur arenas***\n\n**216 May the pumpkin be blessed with the name of the highest Lord**\n\n***Nomine sit domini benedicta Cucurbita summi***\n\n**217 May the lettuce from the garden be blessed by the powerful cross**\n\n***Lactucis horti benedictio sit cruce forti***\n\n**218 May the cross place chopped bitter herbs in vinegar**\n\n***Concisas erbas in acetum crux det acerbas***\n\nI am not quite sure how this section fits together conceptually, but I think it relates to the garden and may belong together with the previous one. To us, grouping herbs and vegetables is not unusual, but we tend to separate the culinary and the medicinal sphere. Ekkehart IV doesn\u2019t, and it would be quite out of character for the era to do so.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not get much useful information from these blessings. Even designations can be very broad. The *radix* of #203 and *semen* of #204 are simply \u2018root\u2019 and \u2018seed\u2019, and while it is at least probable the former refers to radishes, the latter could be any edible seed. Whether the cabbage seeds in #205 are intended as food or medicine is uncertain, but possibly the distinction is artificial anyway.\n\nLeeks and cabbage are two vegetables that we are still familiar with, and both were common. Leeks, both cooked and raw (#210) are also referenced in other contexts and sometimes associated with milk, so cooking them in milk is both justifiable and attested in later sources. For the cabbage, we have no such guidance. They were very likely cooked, possibly with meat or other flavour-enhancing ingredients. Incidentally, we encounter two words for cabbage: *holus* (#209) and *caules* (#212). Possibly the first refers to loose-leaved types while the second, a plural, refers to cabbage heads, but that is speculative.\n\nWe do not know what kind of mushrooms were served or whether the species was considered important, though given the differences in flavour, I suspect there was more art to it than is acknowledged here. Boiling mushrooms repeatedly was a customary way of reducing the harmful qualities they were credited with, so that is not surprising.\n\nThe melons (pepones) of #213 and pumpkins (cucurbita) of #216 are also hard to identify. A pepo could be a melon, but also possibly a kind of gourd. The cucurbita is slightly clearer. While the word is used exclusively for New World pumpkins today, here it must refer to the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). Wahlafrid Strabo write in his 9th century poem on horticulture that it is fried in fat. Perhaps a similar preparation was still enjoyed by Ekkehart.\n\nThe lettuce of #217 is interesting, but we learn nothing about how it was eaten. Hildegardis Bingensis (Physica xc) suggests adding garlic, dill, or vinegar to counteract its harmful effect. That is not implausible, at least, and it would mesh with #218. The herbs referred to here could be a relish or seasoning, but they could as well describe what we think of as a salad. Equally, of course, this could be a reference to the Passover meal. Clerics in the eleventh century were steeped in Old Testament symbolism and familiar with all the key passages considered foreshadowings of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057. They are a collection of blessings to be spoken over food. Written in short rhyming couplets in Latin, they are unusual in their attention to the diversity of foods and preparations. This is not a serious work of theology or medicine, but an intellectual diversion, playful verse meant to show off a broad vocabulary and facility with Latin. That is what makes them very valuable \u2013 they give us a glimpse of the mental horizon of a senior cleric of the 11th century at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1f917nt/blessings_for_herbs_and_vegetables_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1725475642.0, "score": 4, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1f917nt/blessings_for_herbs_and_vegetables_11th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["214 and 215 may be my favourite so far"]}

Its meaning is intuitive, but hard to translate into English. A *Mus* is soft, uniform, and spoonable. It can refer to a puree, a porridge, a custard, and even a jelly or a pasta dish. The chapter on Mus begins with four very similar ones that could be considered high-end health food.\n\nEggs, cream, almonds, sugar, white bread and floral waters were all considered healthy foods, easily digested and pure. They were also, of course, quite expensive. Thus, serving these deceptively simple dishes would have represented the kind of unobtrusive, health-conscious luxury that we associate with artfully arranged organic meats, cheeses, and the superfood du jour in a salad today. They are, unfortunately for the recreationist, also quite bland and dull.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

The perca of #58 is likely the European perch (*Perca fluviatilis*), though it could also refer to the ruffe (*Gymnocephalus pernua*). Both are known as *Barsch* in German today. The poetic point hinges on the similarity between percam and parcam (sparse, poor).\n\nThe crundula and capito in #68 are identified speculatively. Dora explains their association by the fact that the chub (*Squalius cephalus*) was caught using the goby (possibly *Gobio gobio*, though this may also refer to one of the native *gobiidae* species) as bait. That is possible, though gobies, despite their small size, could also have been cooked and served. In medieval times, quite small fish were eaten.\n\nThe *sturio* sturgeon in #72 is probably *Accipenser sturio*, the European Atlantic sturgeon, or possibly the Adriatic sturgeon (*Accipenser naccarii*) as opposed to the more prized Beluga sturgeon referenced in entry #43. Atlantic sturgeons were found in both the Rhine and the Elbe at the time, but they did not range as far inland as St. Gall. If they were actually served there, it would be preserved by salting or smoking.\n\n64 and 65, almost parallel in structure and wording, are also interesting. The fact that a separate passage on peppered fish exists suggests that the use of spices was known, but not universally practiced even by the wealthy. St Gall was a rich monastery, but fish served with spices was unusual enough to attract notice. The epic poem [Waltharius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltharius)which may date to the 10th or 11th century includes a subplot where the hero catches fish in the wild to survive and eventually has the opportunity to present his catch to the king. The fish are prepared with spices (pigmenta, line 440) by the cook which is clearly special treatment fit for a ruler. As an aside, Ekkehart IV is also associated with this text and was at one point identified as its author or editor. I am not sure whether #65 means that a cross was somehow literally put on the fish with spices or \u2013 in my opinion more likely \u2013 they were blessed with the sign of the cross after seasoning, thus peppered under the sign of the cross. Spices were certainly special enough to be used in that kind of ritual, though.\n\nIn a similar suggestion of actual table ritual, the word *pressam* in #66 used suggests that something, perhaps a cross, was actually imprinted on or pressed against the fish. The European or wels catfish (*Silurus glanis*) can be very large, so this is not implausible.\n\nThe word *altitonans* in #67 literally means \u201cthundering from on high\u201d and was a byname of Jupiter that was adopted as a descriptor of God in Christian parlance. I rendered it as \u201cAlmighty\u201d for clarity.\n\nFinally, the closing line of this section refers to the beaver. This animal was widely classed as a fish for purposes of Lent, so it is not surprising to find it here.

Then take a little veal and fat from the kidneys or another kind of good fat and chop that together. Put it into a bowl when it is chopped and add a soup broth to stir it with so that you can spread it (to a spreadable, but not liquid consistency). Put in raisins and all kinds of spices, spread it on the meat slices, and roll them up tightly. Then prepare a round pastry case and lay them in neatly. Put sugar on top, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and small raisins. Close it and let it bake. You can also put in the yolks of hard-boiled eggs. When it is almost baked, pour in half an achtalin of malfasyer (malmsey wine) or ronfel (Reinfal, Ribolla gialla wine) and let it bake fully.**\n\nThis is an interesting idea and an artful conceit, making what is effectively veal [*Rouladen* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderroulade)and baking them in a pie crust. It is also strikingly similar in concept and technique, if not in flavour profile, to the [Pye of Alowes](https://web.archive.org/web/20121026030014/http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/elizabethan/fetch-recipe.php?rid=eliz-booke-pie-aloes) in the mid-century [*Proper Newe Booke of Cokerye*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Proper_Newe_Booke_of_Cokerye). Cookery was very international for the upper crust. The *hetalin* or *hater* of the title is a word that refers to slices of meat. We also meet it as *hattelet*, and it is etymologically related to the word cutlet. The wines, again, are top-shelf luxury items: *Malvasier*, from the area of Monemvasia in Greece, and *Reinfal*, grown around the Adriatic, were imported at great cost and graced the tables of the very wealthy. I venture to guess this recipe was not often made with the genuine article even if it only calls for an eighth (*achtalin*) or a *Ma\u00df* which would come to roughly half a cup.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have been made at the request of her mother and was written by an experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cfdpbj/veal_roulade_pie/", "created_utc": 1714329996.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1cfdpbj/veal_roulade_pie/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

I am not  entirely sure what the various preparations are in every case, but  clearly there are hard- and soft-boiled eggs, various ways of frying  (probably shallow and deep-frying), poaching, and scrambling, as well as  custards, pancakes, and recipes that depend on mixing raw egg with  liquid, probably to drink it. The *kolhopfen* that Olt renders as a *kugelhupf* more  likely is a kind of pancake-based pastry cover where a thin batter is  run around a pan to coat the sides and then filled. Cooked eggs,  meanwhile, are served with vinegar and parsley or used to fill roast  chickens and, as well see further down, all kinds of other dishes. Both  large pastries (*bastede*) and small ones (*krepfelin*) depend on eggs as a base for their filling, something we see reflected over a century later in the recipes of the [*kuchenmaistrey*](https://books2read.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach). Again, I am not sure what preparation eggs *uf dem scharte* are, but the answer very likely is hiding in some recipe collection or poem I have yet to meet. [*Fladen* , a kind of meat-topped flatbread,](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/22/meat-topped-flatbreads/)are a [commonplace dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/24/more-about-fladen/)  depending on eggs to bind their meat toppings. The tradition of serving  chopped boiled egg, whites and yolks separately, is still found in [sixteenth-century recipes for presenting Easter lamb](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/07/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-ii/). Eggs, most plentiful in spring and eartly summer, were a staple of Easter cooking and closely associated with spring. \n\nChicken, too, is prepared in a variety of ways, though it is nowhere  near as complex as egg. Basically, it can be roasted, boiled and served  with a parsley sauce, or cooked to a mush to feed to invalids (the word *gesinde* to  describe them can, but need not mean servants). The vivid description  of hunting down and collectively cooking a single chicken is  entertaining and may well reflect the kind of fun young men of standing  had on campaign, but it is unlikely to have happened very often. \n\nWhat makes the chicken stand out in the kitchen is its year-round  near-universal availability. Almost everyone had chickens, and unlike  other livestock, they were not slaughtered seasonally or tied to a  breeding cycle. A chicken could always be slaughtered and served to an  honoured guest or \u2013 less welcome \u2013 to a landlord or official claiming a  right to hospitality. The *Nachthuhn* as part of the feudal duties of serfs must have rankled even where the demand was occasional.  \n\nThe many technical uses of chicken dung, feathers, and eggs are  fascinating in their own right and I am not entirely sure of all of  them. They are less numerous than [those for the cow](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/13/in-praise-of-the-cow/), though, making this poem much more food-focused than its companion piece. \n\nDer K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald is an otherwise unknown poet whose work is  tentatively dated to the 1340s. His title may refer to a senior rank  among musicians or entertainers, a *Spielmannsk\u00f6nig*, but that is  speculative. Many of his poems are humorous and deal with aspects of  everyday life which makes them quite interesting to us today. The  evident relish with which he describes food and the fact his work is  first recorded in a manuscript owned by the de Leone family led scholars  to consider him the author of the Buoch von Guoter Spise, but that is  unlikely.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1bs9je8/in_praise_of_chickens_c_1340/", "created_utc": 1711888953.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1bs9je8/in_praise_of_chickens_c_1340/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["What an eggcellent poem!"]}
{"title": "Franzbr\u00f6tchen (after 1820)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/17/franzbrotchen/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/17/franzbrotchen/)\n\n Today, my son and I visited his grandmother and she had  bought *Schoko-Quarkbr\u00f6tchen* (a nice, if slightly heavy kind of bun with chocolate flakes baked into it). My son, though, asked for a [*Franzbr\u00f6tchen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franzbr%C3%B6tchen).  This above all marks him out as a proper Hamburger, but it also gave me  the opportunity to involve him in producing that sticky confection \u2013 or  to try, given he defected from the kitchen to watch an Asterix movie  with his grandma. He enthusiastically helped eat them, though. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4uk9gywamyoc1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9a57f4bb04da0ce095b6b957838c5dcb919d81f\n\nThe *Franzbr\u00f6tchen* is a [legendary piece of local lore](https://franzbroetchen.de/die-herkunft-des-franzbroetchens/),  its history lost in the mists of deep time, but like many such  patriotic fables, it turns out to be an invention of the nineteenth  century. Today, it is ubiquitous. No bakery in Hamburg is without the  sticky, squashed cinnamon roll either in the buttery original or the  many varieties that have been multiplying lately. Depending on the  season, I can now get *Franzbr\u00f6tchen* with nuts, chocolate,  marzipan, streusel, plums, strawberries, pumpkin, apple, or cherry  compote on my way to work. My preference is still the basic version,  though. \n\nLegend has it that Franzbr\u00f6tchen were created by Hamburg\u2019s bakers  when the occupying troops of Napoleonic Marshal Davout demanded  croissants. This is implausible because a) though they look a little  like failed croissants, the technique is not similar at all, b)  Hamburg\u2019s bakers were quite capable of producing a flaky butter dough  and c) [croissants are not that old](https://books.google.de/books/about/August_Zang_and_the_French_Croissant.html?id=7MfvT_NOdHsC&redir_esc=y). Rather, they seem to be associated with the *Franz\u2019sche* (French) *B\u00e4ckerei* in  neighbouring Altona and make their first appearance in the 1820s. While  this business had been founded by French immigrants, it was then run by  a German family. There is no reason to think they were inspired by [croissants, Emperor Franz, or a Franciscan friar\u2019s medieval charity](https://www.shmh.de/das-geheimnis-der-franzbroetchen/).  The nineteenth century saw a creative explosion in confectionery. The  Franzbr\u00f6tchen is, after all, quite similar to the Danish cinnamon roll  which was also invented then (and Altona was a Danish city until 1864). \n\nSo, what is this thing the Hamburgers are so proud of? Basically, a  Franzbr\u00f6tchen is a piece of butter-laminated yeast dough rolled up with  cinnamon and sugar. Unlike a Danish pastry, it is not turned on its  side, but squashed down the middle to expose much of the filling during  baking. This caramelises the sugar as it mixes with the melting butter,  creating the sticky, brown layer covering a proper *Franzbr\u00f6tchen*. It\u2019s a great treat for a wet, drizzly, dreary day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n726e6ucmyoc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93d4b32b5767717f309b54b14aca7e5d291e6a2b\n\n A professionally made *Franzbr\u00f6tchen* depends on folding butter  into its dough multiple times. Bakeries use machines to do this and  produce many layers. If you are working at home, there is no need to.  All you need is a yeast dough of flour, milk, eggs, and sugar that you  roll out, spread with butter, fold over, and roll out again once or  twice. Since you are working with yeast, you need to use room  temperature butter rather than the iced blocks of classic pate  feuillet\u00e9e, but that actually makes it easier. After you have worked the  butter layers in, you roll out the dough one last time, brush it with  water (or melted butter, if you are looking for a  very rich mix),  cover it with sugar and cinnamon, and roll it up.  You then cut the roll  into pieces about four centimetres long and squash them down the  centreline with the handle of a wooden spoon. That produces the  characteristic shape of the *Franzbr\u00f6tchen*.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yp1oweemyoc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfeb2620d9dc965d24feab6a6dc089f86856fad\n\n If you make them at home, you are free to vary the spices \u2013 I like  ginger and mace along with my cinnamon \u2013 and the richness, and produce  small rolls rather than the large portions bakeries sell. I like to have  them about 5-8 centimetres across, perfect for serving with tea. So  far, all responses have been encouraging. Try it, and be sure to mention  that the recipe was brought to the Hanseatic city of Hamburg by a baker  sentenced for manslaughter to complete a pilgrimage to Rome, where he  learned it from a Franciscan. It\u2019s not true, but everybody likes to hear  these kind of stories.

We find them used  in sauces and confections, so putting them in a tart should not be  surprising. Aside from the consistency \u2013 achieved by thickening the  liquid puree with fine wheat bread boiled in it and passed through a  sieve \u2013  the three recipes are very similar and again attest to a the  unadventurous nature of this recipe collection; sugar, cinnamon, butter.  This is good, but it must have got old quickly.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of  Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The  recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely  produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have  been made at the request of her mother and was written by an  experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine  Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near  Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der  Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1bce3uv/sour_cherry_tarts_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1710190543.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1bce3uv/sour_cherry_tarts_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Is semel a kind of plant used to make bread"]}

To bake it, you must do as  follows: Put it into the tart pan and bake it for a good while until you  think it is half baked. Then take it out and pour hot fat over it. Then  put it back in straight away and let it bake well. When you want to  take it out, take it out again and brush it with dissolved sugar (er lasnen zucker)  and put it back in for a while. That way, it will turn nicely brown  from the sugar. It should also be sprinkled with rosewater, that way it  is proper.***\n\nThere are a few interesting aspects to this, and it resolves that the *er lasnen zucker* of both this and yesterday\u2019s recipe very likely is a [clarified and caramelised sugar syrup](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/16/clarifying-sugar-with-philippine-welser/).  It also suggests that what made a tart \u201cEnglish\u201d was at least in part a  method of preparation, not just its ingredients. The sequence of   baking the tart, removing it from the pan to soak it in hot fat, baking  again, then brushing with sugar syrup and browning it over is  fascinating and suggestive of the things that may be left unsaid in  terser instructions elsewhere.  \n\nThe filling is that of yesterday\u2019s tart: \n\n***First take a good, sweet, fat cheese that is not old or crumbly (resch).  Grate it small and put the grated cheese into a bowl, as much as you  please. Add 2 times as much egg and 4 times as much butter so it can  become like a thin batter (diner tayg), and add a very small  amount of flour to it. Stir it well in the bowl, but do not make the  batter too thin, so that you can keep it on the tart base (boden). Last, add some dissolved sugar (der lasnen zucker) to it. Then bake it nicely small, and when it is baked, sprinkle sugar on it while it is hot. Thus it is proper and good.***\n\nLike I said before, the proportions feel off to me, but not so much  as to suggest an error. Depending on the relation of flour to egg and  the consistency of the cheese, this could work. Here, the cooking  technique involves a higher heat and may produce soome rising,  especially if the egg is beaten thoroughly. I wonder what the purpose of  applying hot fat may be, given there is already so much butter in the  mix. It may be for browning, or to prevent sticking, or perhaps the  crust is expected to absorb so much of it. This is certainly a recipe  worth playing with. \n\nFinally, it is a recipe we should keep in mind when inmterpreting  earlier instructions for making \u201cEnglish\u201d tarts such as this one from  the Meister Hans collection of around 1460: \n\n***Recipe #95*** ***Ainen ennglischn fladen mache den also***\n\n***Make an English fladen (flat pie) thus***\n\n***Item (take) soft cheese, butter and pepper, mingle it  together, make a pastry case of dough and fill it with the cheese over half (halfway full). Let it bake in a pot (baking dish). This is called  an English flad(en)***\n\nClearly this is not the same recipe. However, it may be aiming for a  similar technique, a certain fluffiness produced by high top heat, and  maybe browning on top. I haven\u2019t tried this or its parallels yet, but if  I do, I will certainly take the recipe in Philippine Welser as a  guideline for my experiments. Extrapolating backwards is perilous,  especially in a tradition as allergic to proper names as the German one,  but the recipes are too similar to be unrelated. It is at least a  plausible approach.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

{"title": "Recipe Testing Session (c. 1450)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/25/a-meatless-recipe-testing-session/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/25/a-meatless-recipe-testing-session/)\n\n On the anniversary of last year\u2019s [fritter ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/25/experiment-fig-raisin-fritters/)[experimenting ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/27/experiment-zucker-krepffle/)[session](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/28/experiment-wafer-fritters/),  I got together with some local friends from my mnedieval club for an  arts & sciences meeting. I, of course, provided food. It was a good  opportunity to try out a few recipes from recent translations, and since  the hostess is vegetarian, I picked meatless food.  \n\n \n\n[The main course](https://preview.redd.it/ym25veoogqkc1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16a7f824dcc52a9c5fdb11b3b84823634d2cb911)\n\nAs our  main course, we opted for that mysterious pancake/omelet/thing called a [reuschkuochen ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/01/reuschkuochen-an-interesting-recipe/)from the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf). \n\n***48 How to prepare a Reu\u00dfchkuochen***\n\n***Chop equal amounts of parsley and sage and fry it in  butter. Cook eggs soft and mix this together, and grate cheese and bread  into it. Prepare a pancake (plat) of eggs and pour butter underneath. Set it over the fire and let it fry. These are Reuschkuochen.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Filling, ready to go](https://preview.redd.it/rhi3nbtrgqkc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6494b4a8149786864babddae672fe29399d6d99e)\n\n There is a world of latitude in these sentences, but the basic thrust at  least is clear. I started out with a handful of fresh sage and parsley  each which I chopped and briefly fried in a tablespoon of butter. I did  not let the leaves crisp and brown, though that is a possibility. Then, I  added four soft-boiled eggs and mashed trhe whole. It is possible that  instead, scrambled eggs is intended, but I doubt it. More plausibly,  this instruction could refer to just the  yolk of soft-boiled eggs,  excluding the solidified whites. Since my eggs turned out a little too  hard, I added another raw egg to achieve a spreadable consistency. For  cheese, I used grated gouda and a tablespoon of breadcrumbs which, in  this case, really served no function which suggests the eggs are  supposed to be a lot more liquid.   \n\n \n\n[Reuschkuochen in the pan](https://preview.redd.it/tp83vwgvgqkc1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5134bb0b6e1d8254c0cf1501c501486826aee1df)\n\nThe next question is the plat, a word that just means a flat thing. I  interpreted it as a pancake in the modern sense, mostly consisting of  beaten egg stiffened with a little flour. Just egg also works, but I was  concerned about burning it too fast. I poured the egg batter into hot  butter, waiterd for it to solidify along the bottom, spread the filling  on it, and sprinkled it with leftover grated cheese. Then I covered the  pan and let it cook on a  medium heat until the whole was solid and the  cheese on top had melted. Again, we do not know that is how it was done \u2013  the filling could also be wrapped up and deep-fried \u2013 but the word  kuochen suggests a round, flat shape. As things went, it worked. The  resulting dish is rich, savoury, and very pleasant. We ate two of them  between the four of us. \n\nAs a side dish, I opted for [beans in a spicy beer and vinegar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/19/beans-in-a-pfeffer-sauce/) sauce, also from the Mondseer Kochbuch:\n\n \n\n[Heating beans in the sauce](https://preview.redd.it/pztvack0hqkc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c694f98434cfe06b806ebf4ff7618df851daeae)\n\n***29 How to prepare a condiment sauce over beans***\n\n***Boil green (i.e. fresh) beans until they are soft. Then  take fine bread and a little pepper, and three times as much caraway.  Grind it together with vinegar and with beer, add saffron, and pour off  the broth. Pour on the ground (sauce) and salt it in measure. Let it  boil up in the condiment sauce and serve it.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe, one of the few we have for cooking  beans, which must have been much more common even on the tables of the  wealthy than the paucity of sources suggests. The sauce is interesting  for using beer, but otherwise it is a basic bread-thickened *pfeffer* sauce more commonly served over meat. Another question is the identiy of the spices. The modern *K\u00fcmmel* in  Germany clearly refers to caraway, so that was my preferred  translation, but the word is not as clear in Middle German. I am  obligated to [Jim Chevallier](https://www.chezjim.com/) for pointing me to the ubiquity of cumin (German *Kreuzk\u00fcmmel*)  in early medieval cuisine which got me to start looking at the word  again. I am not at all sure that it must mean cumin here, but I believe  at least that it could, and that this merits further research. So I  decided to go with cumin this day to see if the combination works, and  it did.  \n\nI started out with cooked broad beans (*Vicia faba*, the most  likely candidate whenever \u2018beans\u2019 are mentioned before the 1550s) and  made a sauce by boiling beer and vinegar, stirring in breadcrumbs, and  seasoning it with pepper, cumin, and salt. I passed it through once, but  it could well have stood more pureeing. Because I had used too much  bread, I had to dilute it with water to get it liquid enough and found  that this improved the otherwise too concentrated flavour. Of course,  what constituted \u2018beer\u2019 in the 1450s versus today is a far bigger  stumbling block for reconstructing this in a modern kitchen. Still, the  principle held and it worked. Heating the beans in the sauce melded the  flavours nicely. It may not look like much, but it tastes very good.  Adding copious saffron may help the optics, but is unlikely to improve  the taste.\n\nTo accompany both, I decided to try a third recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch: [Snalenberger or Swallenbergs sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/24/honey-ginger-garlic-sauce/).\n\n***45 How to prepare Snalenberger sauce***\n\n***Take wine and thick honey and let it boil. Add ground  ginger, more than pepper, and pound garlic, but not too much. Make it  strong (season it strongly) and stir it with a piece of wood (ainer schinnen). Let it boil until it begins to burn. You shall eat this in cold winter.***\n\n \n\n[Garlic in honey and wine, before cooking](https://preview.redd.it/8k9h7u73hqkc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac1dcde667cc25b16eca79fd4a4fe1924eb11d54)\n\nI really did not know what to expect here, but was going to give it a  try. Garlic, honey, a little wine, and ginger and pepper boiled down  until it begins to caramelise (at least, that is how I read \u201cuntil it  begins to burn\u201d). I used chopped garlic mainly for time economy, and it  turned out not to hurt, but I think mortar-pounded garlic, even heeding  the instruction not to do this too much, would have a finer consistency.  But this was a first attempt and as such, it succeeded beautifully. \n\nCooking down the honey on a low heat took over two hours, fortunately  not requiring continuous stirring on a modern electric stove, and  resulted in a reddish-brown liquid that, when cooled, solidified into a  sticky paste. The conststency reminded me strongly of the [portable honey mustard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/02/another-mustard-recipe/)  I tried years ago, and I suspect that the original may be meant as a  similar instant sauce to be diluted before serving. We didn\u2019t because we  were hungry, and it worked very well with the *reuschkuochen*, to general surprise. Ginger, garlic and honey make a tasty combination, vaguely reminiscent of some Chinese sauces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Clockwise from top left: beer beans, reuschkuochen, Snalenberger sauce](https://preview.redd.it/ldbe9aa8hqkc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72259b08e0eee2f8153569bb09b3f07a88d6550b)\n\n There was a dessert of pie and three kinds of krapfen, but I will deal with it in a later post.

Stir it all well together and if the dough  is not soft enough, add a little more warm milk. When all is stirred  well and the dough detaches from the bowl, work them thoroughly with  your hands on a table and roll it out as evenly as the sheet on which it  is meant to be baked. \u2026***\n\nA *Kl\u00f6ben* or *Klaben* is the North German equivalent of a *Stolle* or *Striezel*, a rich, heavy cake with spices and dried fruit traditionally eaten in winter. Unlike the *Stollen* in Dresden, *Kl\u00f6ben* never  was associated exclusively with Christmas, though. It has thus dies out  almost completely, replaced by more contemporary confections like  brioche, *Rosinenstuten*, and croissants. \n\nDespite including measurements, the recipe is not entirely  self-explanatory. Referring to the related one for Hannoverscher Kuchen  helps with the preparation procedure, and in the end I guesstimated the  size of a beer glass and divided the quantities by ten. That gave me a  manageable 500g of flour (I used Typ 405), 100g of butter, a slightly  implausible 12.5g of sugar  and a few tablespoons of syrup (I did not  measure these exactly), about a quarter cup of raisins and currants, and  a teaspoon of cinnamon. I mixed the dry ingredients, then worked in the   butter and turned the whole into a pliable dough with milk in which I  had dissolved the yeast. Since I was not sure of the consistency aimed  for, I went with what I normally use for yeast Stollen. It took a long  time to rise, but then baked very well. Unfortunately, by that time it  was quite late and I was a little impatient, so I overlooked the loaf  had tipped on its side on the cooling rack. That explains the somewhat  unusual bendy shape. \n\nToday, I tried some and I have to say it is quite good. While it is  nowhere near as sugary rich as Stollen, it is noticeably sweet and  assertively spicy. It also toasts well. I\u2019ll bring some to work tomorrow  to test on my colleagues.

When you see that the mass (der kitt)  holds together (solidifies/coagulates) and it comes up and the sugar  turns brown, take it off the fire and strain it carefully through a  cloth. Then put it back on the trivet and let it stand for an hour, and  when you see it is brown (prun ist), take the sugar off the fire and put it with the thing you wish to preserve, be it ginger or apples of paradise (paredeyss epfoll) or other things. Let it stand for a long time until it turns lukewarm (lab), that is proper.***\n\nWe had [other ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/11/clarifying-sugar/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/30/clarifying-sugar-after-walter-ryff/)for  clarifying sugar from the sixteenth century, but this one is  interestingly different. The goal does not seem to be producing a clear,  white sugar but to caramelise it. As the final sentences explain, it is  intended as a syrup to preserve foods, among other things ginger, a  process often described in Renaissance cookbooks.\n\n  The description made me curious, so I tried to replicate the basic  conditions: a pound of sugar, about 800 ml of water, and one egg white  beaten together and slowly brought to a moderate heat. It took more  power than I thought it would, but the pot bubbled and produced a  surprising amount of solid foam. This is caused by the egg white and  probably is the *kitt* that \u201ccomes up\u201d in the recipe. Since this  was industrially refined sugar, there were no  impurities in evidence  and the syrup started out clear. After it had reduced by about half, it  started to turn honey-coloured and I strained it, removing the foam.  After being returned to the pot, the syrup again produced copious, but  not solid foam and  the colour darkened. In equal measure intimidated  and bored, I decided to end the experiment before producing very dark  brown and poured it off into a metal bowl. It promptly began to form  small, grainy crystals, something that has often happened to me with  German-made beet sugar. I don\u2019t think it would have happened with the  original.   \n\n Incidentally, I am not sure what \u2018apples of paradise\u2019 are. There are  various types of apple locally known by that name today, but I do not  think the writer would use this distinction when everywhere else,  \u201capples\u201d was clear enough. Austrian dialect uses the word to refer to a  tomato which is technically possible, but highly unlikely in the  mid-sixteenth century. In the past, pomegranates were also called apples  of paradise,  but I have yet to find that term in culinary recipes.  Finally, the manchineel (Hippomane mancinella) is sometimes called this,  but that plant is not only strictly tropical, but also lethally  poisonous. None of the candidates look like a good fit. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of  Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A  number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a  collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The  recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely  produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg. It may have  been made at the request of her mother and was written by an  experienced scribe. Some later additions, though, are in Philippine  Welser\u2019s own hand, suggesting she used it.\n\nThe manuscript is currently held in the library of Ambras Castle near  Innsbruck as PA 1473 and was edited by Gerold Hayer as Das Kochbuch der  Philippine Welser (Innsbruck 1983).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/198crp9/sugar_syrup_according_to_philippine_welser_c_1550/", "created_utc": 1705436407.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/198crp9/sugar_syrup_according_to_philippine_welser_c_1550/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["After your experiment, did you use the sugar syrup?

{"title": "Fritters from the Tegernsee List (c. 1500)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/15/fritters-from-the-tegernsee-list/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/15/fritters-from-the-tegernsee-list/)\n\nAgain a longer hiatus, but here is another interesting part of the  Tegernsee list. We cannot reconstruct the dishes here because the  majority of ingredients do not seem to have come from managed stores,  but the variety of fritters served is interesting, and we have surviving  recipes for some of them.\n\n**7 Of fritters (pachen) for 40 persons**\n\n**For strauben: 35 eggs**\n\n**For round strauben (ringen streublen): 8/9 each**\n\n**For wreaths (kr\u00e4ntzen) 1 egg each**\n\n**effendmt (?) 20 eggs**\n\n**maulkorb (lit. muzzles) the same**\n\n**hasen\u00f6rl (hare\u2019s ears): 1 egg each**\n\n**Fried sheets: 1 egg each, 40 for the dough/batter, a kand (Kanne?) of wine**\n\n**Choux fritters (? prannten k\u00fcechl): 2 eggs each**\n\n**Milk fritters (milchkuechl): 70 eggs, 1 Ma\u00df of milk**\n\n**Fried apples: 40 eggs, a drink of wine at the time of no eggs**\n\n**Fried sage: each 1 egg, 1 cup of wine**\n\n**Filled semel loaves: 30 eggs, 8 semel loaves**\n\n**Filled wafers: each 1 egg**\n\n**strupffen: each 2 eggs, a little cream**\n\n**fried semel: 40 eggs, 9 semel loaves**\n\n**Golden slices (French toast): the same**\n\n**Pancakes (pfanzelten): 1 drink of wine**\n\n**eingezogen k\u00fcechl: 1 stored cheese, each 2 eggs, raisins**\n\n**Monks (m\u00fcnchen): each 2 eggs for the filling, spices for the sheets and a handful of raisins, one drink of cream**\n\n**For the sauce to go with it, 2 handfuls of raisins and spices**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet us look at a few of those fritters: The first type mentioned, [*strauben*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/09/strauben-fritters-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/), were the most basic type. Some recipes survive, and it seems that they were made from a [fairly thick batter](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/04/figuring-out-straubenteig/)  that was pulled out between the hands. Most likely they were leavened,  probably with yeast, and while some versions are enriched with dairy or  raisins, these seem to be a simple water-based kind. The *ringen streublen*  in second position very likely are just rings made from the same  batter. The difference between using eggs for serving 40 and counting  8/9 of an egg per person is close enough to fall within the normal  variation of egg sizes. I wonder why the distinction was made at all.\n\nThe next, *kr\u00e4ntzen* (wreaths), are not documented elsewhere as far as I know. The dough or batter is a little richer with eggs than the one for *strauben*,  and the description as wreaths suggests that it was firm enough to be  molded or braided. Beyond this, I cannot say what it was like. Too many  aspects of consistency and the production process are unknown.\n\nThe fritter known as *effendmt* is very likely the same that shows up as *\u00e4ffenmndt* served  on cooked barley. That suggests a descriptive name, monkey mouths, for a  fritter defined by its shape. Today, we have fritters and baked  confections such as bear paws ([*B\u00e4rentatzen*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A4rentatze_(Geb%C3%A4ck))) or elephant ears (*Elefantenohren*), and as we see with the hares\u2019 ears (*hasen\u00f6rl*) further down, the tradition goes back this far. The *maulkorb* (in  modern German a muzzle for dogs, but also used for a feedbag) using the  same amount of egg likely is much the same thing in a different shape.  We know that *\u00e4ffendmnt* were served over a main dish and thus likely were not sweet. We cannot be sure for *maulkorb*.\n\nThe *hasen\u00f6rl* (hares\u2019 ears) listed further down use the same amount of egg as *kr\u00e4ntzen*, but probably differed in some material way in their preparation. I have yet to find a recipe, but there are [references ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/11/frying-chervil/)in [several ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/06/fried-stars-and-dagging/)[sources ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/10/an-odd-recipe-from-the-innsbruck-ms/)that  use similar dough for different fritters. It is described as firm  enough to be rolled out and cut. That suggests that the dough used for *kr\u00e4ntzen*, while similar, may use a softer, more pliable dough. Whether one or both were leavened is speculative.\n\nThe fried sheets involving one egg per person plus a quantity of eggs  to be used for a dough or batter suggests a kind of filled fritters.  These were not uncommon [both as rolled-up pancakes and as rolled-out sheets](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/26/some-experiments-with-fritters/), and unfortunately the word used for the material (*taig*)  can mean both a liquid batter or a solid dough. The description does  nothing to resolve the ambiguity. All we can say is that the filling was  based on eggs, likely boiled and mixed with other ingredients. Our best  candidate is a similarly named [recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/24/egg-filled-fritters/):  Here, a filling of eggs is first rolled in dough sheets and these are dipped in a batter before frying.\n\nThe *prannten k\u00fcechl* most likely refers to what is known as *Brandteig* today, a choux paste. The [technique ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/28/another-choux-fritter/)is [documented well](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/08/a-possible-choux-pastry-recipe/) and was used to produce [various shapes and sizes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/05/lamp-choux-fritters/) of fritters. At two eggs per head, we are likely looking at some sort of filling or just a very rich holiday dish.\n\nThe *milchkuechl* that follow are fritters made from a pliable, but solid dough that is made with milk. The later [*Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflich Kochbuch*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Culinary-Recipes-from-the-Kuenstlich-und-Fuertrefflichs-Kochbuch.pdf) has a [recipe by that name](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/27/milk-fritters/)  that describes a version of choux paste where the flour is stired into  hot, but not boiling milk, and the proximity to the preceding recipe  actually makes that a likely candidate.\n\nThe fried apples mentioned next may well be just cored and peeled  apples, possibly filled as they often are in other recipes, dipped in  batter, and fried in fat. There are [numerous ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/26/apple-filled-apples/)[surviving ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/14/fried-filled-apples-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/14/fried-filled-apples-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)for [these](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/13/deep-fried-filled-apples-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/), and we cannot be sure which type we are looking at and how complex the preparation would be.\n\nFried sage is interesting because while these may just be fritters seasoned with sage, there are [recipes for frying whole sage leaves with a spicy filling](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/01/sage-fritters-from-the-new-book/) between each two, as was more commonly done with wafers. Of course, sage leaves can also just be[ battered and fried without any additions](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/29/battering-and-frying-everything-de-rontzier/). However, the quantity of eggs suggests either a filling or a solid amount of dough rather than just dipped leaves.\n\nFilled semel may refer to entire stuffed breadrolls, for which we have[ a surviving recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/27/stuffed-breadrolls-with-birds-and-raisins/).  These would be hollowed out, stuffed, battered and fried.  The number  of semel suggest dividing one between five diners, which seems paltry,  so more likely we are looking at semel loaves sliced thin, with a sticky  filling spread between each two, and the whole sandwich battered and  fried. That would make them quite similar to the filled wafers listed  next, a popular type of fritter that occurs in numerous sources and that  [I have cooked before](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/28/experiment-wafer-fritters/). You simply use slices of white bread instead of wafers.\n\nI am not entirely sure what *strupffen* are, but the large  amount of eggs and the extravance of using cream suggests a rich batter  or dough that may not have needed any more refinement than this. The  name suggests a plucked or ragged appearance.\n\nI would suggest that, again, fried semel and golden slices are  largely the same thing, the dishes again being organised thematically.  The latter is a common name for what we call French toast in English and  *Arme Ritter* in German today: bread slices soaked and coated in  an egg batter and fried. The quantity of eggs sounds roughly right, and  the dishes would differ only in that one included the coveted *semel* loaves while the other used a different kind of bread.\n\n*Pfanzelten* is a way of saying pancake, and it is interesting  that no eggs are specified for these. There were many different pancake  recipes and not all of them involved eggs, but with what I think is a  relatively small quantity of wine, this seems a particularly meager one.  Perhaps these were leavened, with a thick batter, rather than thin and  flat.\n\nThe *eingezogen k\u00fcechl* appear to be a kind of cheese fritter,  anyother category of recipe that was quite popular. In the simplest  form, you would mix grated cheese, flour, and eggs into a dough and  fried it. I do not know what distinguished them from things like [*krumme* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/29/krumme-krapfen-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)[*krapfen* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/31/bent-fritters-from-cgm-384-ii/)or [*angestrichenes*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/02/another-cheese-fritter-from-the-inntalkochbuch/),  but very likely it was some aspect of their preparation, how they were  shaped or whether they were thick or thin. I also do not know the exact  size of a cheese, so I cannot judge how much this would produce per  person, but unless it is a very small one, the quantity seems ample. At  two eggs per person, a [*Handk\u00e4se*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handk%C3%A4se)\\-sized lump seems out of balance.\n\nFinally, the *m\u00fcnchen* (monks) are not a name I know from  anywhere else yet, but the ingredients suggest a filled fritter with a  rich sauce. This sounds much like what other sources know as krapfen,  basically a thin sheet of dough folded around a filling. There are [numerous ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/07/three-krapfen-fillings/)[varieties ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/03/cheese-bacon-fritters/)of  these surviving in recipe sources and it is anyone\u2019s guess what made  these different from other kinds. Perhaps, like stereotypical monks,  they were particularly rotund. The raisins, spices, and separate raisin  sauce would certainly have made this a luxurious dish.\n\nSo to conclude, a survey of roughly contemporary sources gives us at  least plausible reconstructions of most of these dishes. We are still  far from putting the full menu of Tegernsee on the table, but this is no  longer nearly as baffling as it was.\n\nThe recipe collection from the monastery at Tegernsee (Bavaria) is an  unusual source. It seems to have been produced to serve very specific  practical purposes in the administration of that particular monastery,  giving quantities for dishes and instructing the reader on which days  what is to be served. A calendar and a short treatise on fishes are  written in the same manuscript, the whole produced around 1500 and in  use until at least 1534. The text was partially edited by Anton  Birlinger in Germania 9/1864 ( pp. 192-207) who regarded it as a  resource for linguistic study.

I\u2019m instead going to tell you about my son\u2019s seventh  birthday and how to make historic cooking accessible.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3b2yeqst2bc1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb1b8504714dd84b4dc9b3faf3ad75c4b3c75f48\n\n First off, a bit of background: My son turned seven. He is really into  Asterix at the moment (he wants to collect all the comincs, I read him  one yesterday and he watched the animated cartoon today), and he is very  proud of how big and strong he is and how much he can eat. So  naturally, Obelix is fascinating to him. The weekend before Christmas, a  local supermarket had frozen wild boar on special, so I grabbed a  piece. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with it, but when I asked him if  he would like to try it, he was quite enthusiastic.  \n\n The result was a small birthday spread: I rubbed the boar with salt,  cumin, mustardseed flour, and savory and slowly roasted it on a bed of  onions and garlic, barded with a protective layer of bacon and drizzled  with honey. This is not a historically documented or even plausible  technique, but it is \u2018close enough\u2019, a way of combining the flavours  available to the ancient Gauls with the way we are accustomed to eating  game. The result, after three hours starting at 150\u00b0C in a closed  container and finally going to 200\u00b0C open, was tender, juicy, and very  nice, though not nearly as spicy as I expected.   \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n6f88dut2bc1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b5869c358d246e3718063c6ff361dfe6320fd86\n\nTo go with the boar (which my son loved and ate three slices of), I  prepared a porridge of barley and lentils cooked in broth, some green  peas (the only vegetable my son actually enjoys instead of tolerates),  and some fresh barley bread. These loaves are, obviously, not pure  barley, they are a mix of barley and wheat flour, leavened with yeast.  But they came fresh from the oven and again introduced a flavour that,  taken pure and crunchy, would likely have been rejected. For a sauce, we  had the cooking juices of the boar (excellent in a concentrated  honey-umami-caramel way) as well as [hela ketchup](https://www.hela-shop.eu/). \n\nThis is not \u201ceating like the ancient Gauls\u201d, though it probably is  closer than what many self-styled historical restaurants offer. But I  think it is a good way to interest people who aren\u2019t usually adventurous  eaters in historical foods. My son certainly is interested in boar now,  much as he is in duck after trying it in the company of friends and in  chestnuts after collecting some last summer. Once he is older, I hope he  will also take an interest in cooking things himself.

The translation is more  challenging that straightforward recipes, so the intervals between posts  are liable to stay a bit longer for a while. Here is section six:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tegernsee abbey c. 1560](https://preview.redd.it/11rdteul4gac1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=845b2b4dd4f09e11b1d5b796171fa4cfaad5f96e)\n\n***6 Of milk and the dishes that are made of milk, for 40 persons:***\n\n***Buttermilk: 14 Ma\u00df and 4 courtly pounds (hoffpfund) of butterfat (puttersmalz), one piece of buttered bread (schmalzen prot) each***\n\n***Two (pieces of) butter weighing 7 hoffpfund, 2 slices of a gingerbread loaf (zelten) and two (loaves of) lordly bread (herrenprot).***\n\n***Clabbered milk: 7 Ma\u00df and 10*** **lautter** ***(?) go in it***\n\n**Modlmilch** ***(custard): 80 eggs, 6*** **Ma\u00df** ***of milk prepared as an egg cheese (ayrk\u00e4s), then 10*** **Ma\u00df** ***of pure milk.***\n\n***For egg cheese (ayrk\u00e4\u00df): 200 eggs, 20*** **Ma\u00df** ***of milk, 1 lb of raisins to go in it.***\n\n***For pressed milk: 2 eggs each and 9*** **Ma\u00df** ***of milk.***\n\n**Voglspei\u00df** ***(lit. bird food): 3 eggs each, 3 drinks of milk.***\n\n**Gewurz** ***(lit. spices): 2 eggs each, 1*** **Ma\u00df** ***of wine or none, 4 (pieces of) bread, 4*** **semel** ***loaves, the bread is toasted, 1*** **Ma\u00df** ***of milk.***\n\n***Roasted eggs: 2 eggs each.***\n\n***Yellow milk: 2 eggs each, 1 drink of milk, 1*** **semel** ***loaf, a handful of caraway, raisins, and spices.***\n\n***Entire filled eggs: 2 eggs each and spices.***\n\n***Half filled eggs: 2 eggs each, 10 for the filling***\n\n**Kn\u00f6del** ***from the shells: 2 eggs, 1*** **semel** ***and 10 eggs mixed in, and spices***\n\n***For cakes with greens (kuechln auf das kraut): 70 eggs, 2*** **seml** ***loaves, spices, one handful of figs cut small.***\n\n***Cakes from a fruit sauce (kuchen aus dem zizendel): 2 eggs each, 2*** **seml** ***loaves, spices, a handful of raisins.***\n\n**Pf\u00e4nzl** ***(dumplings) on greens: 50 eggs, 1*** **semel** ***loaf.***\n\n***Ox eyes or cold fried eggs (kalts ayrnschmalz): 2 eggs each.***\n\n***For ground milk (geribnen milch): 12*** **Ma\u00df** ***of milk, 8 eggs, prepared like an egg cheese, then rubbed in the dish with butter, 2 lbs, and a drink of honey.***\n\nThis is both interesting and slightly infuriating. The Tegernsee  document, despite being called a Kochb\u00fcchlein or recipe book by its  editor, is not that. It looks like an administrative document,  instructions for running the kitchen of the monastery, and must be read  through that lens. Unfortunately, even as such it is not entirely clear.  We know by comparing its entries with surviving recipes that the lists  of ingredients are not complete. Most likely, they refer to ingredients  that are controlled by the estate manager, as opposed to things the  kitchen had ready access to. This explanation makes sense since the list  includes valuable ingredients such as eggs, cheese, and milk, spices,  dried fruit, and wine, all of which would have been drawn from stores.\n\nBeyond having to mentally add other ingredients, we also do not fully  understand the measures applied here. Eggs are counted, but even the  size of a hard cheese or a *semel* loaf are subject to variation. *Semel* was the finest grade of bread commercially produced and usually sold in small, individual portion rolls. The word *Semmel* refers to a breakfast bread roll today. The size likely was similar. We also do not know what is meant by the countable noun \u201c*brot*\u201c. It is hard to see how it can refer to regular bread loaves given the discrepancy between *semel* and  bread that would create in some recipes. I suspect it means a  standardised portion, but that is speculation. Finallyy, what exactly  set apart the lordly bread (*herrenprot*) from the regular kind  is unclear. I suspect it was particularly fine white bread, possibly  made to a higher standard than even semel, but it could also be a fine  rye bread or enriched in some way.\n\nOther measures are also problematic. The Ma\u00df is fairly clear, a standard trade measure usually hovering around a litre. The *pfund* most  likely refers to the trade pound, though it may mean the Roman pound  used in the Benedictine rule. Some monasteries took these things very  seriously. The distinction betweeen the *pfund* and *hoffpfund* is not clear. A [*hofpfund* ](https://woerterbuchnetz.de/?sigle=DWB&lemid=H11128)is  generally understood as the weight standard used in a given court, a  practice that makes sense for itinerant princes moving between different  residences. Unfortunately, we do not have details as to which court is  meant. Then we have the *trinken*, literally a drink. It may simply mean a drinking vessel, though there is a reference to a *becher* elsewhere  in the text, or it may mean the quantity usually allowed one person to  drink. I suspect it is somewhere between 0.2 and 0.5 litres, but will  need to do more research.\n\nGoing beyond the problems, what makes this source interesting is that  it illustrates the variety of dishes served and can help us reconstruct  some basic ratios. This section is just the dairy and egg dishes  typically produced for the refectory, and we have a wide range of  options: Buttermilk, served with bread or butter (or possibly as a  buttered bread porridge), and plain butter, but also clabbered milk and a  variety of custards. One of them is served with milk in the way[ fresh cheeses commonly were](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/01/all-the-almond-cheeses/), and we have [surviving recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=roast+milk)  for the firmer kinds of custards known as egg cheese. Eggs themselves  are served fried or, more elaborately, as filled eggs (boiled eggs with  the yolks scooped out and turned into a seasoned filling), or as[ roasted eggs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/02/filled-eggshells-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) (seasoned, returned to their shells, and roasted on a spit). The *k\u00fcechen*, *kucheln* and *pfl\u00e4nzl* most likely refers to fried dumplings of some description with egg as the main ingredient.\n\nFinally, the most interesting thing for me is the grated or ground custard listed at the end. It reminds me a little of the [*Mayenmus* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/18/may-dish-from-the-kuenstlichs-und-furtrefflichs-kochbuch/)recipe from the 1559 [kuenstlichs und fuertrefflichs Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Culinary-Recipes-from-the-Kuenstlich-und-Fuertrefflichs-Kochbuch.pdf).  Reading the recipe\u2019s detailed (if confusing) instructions is a salutary  reminder that an ingredient list does not make a dish. More  importantly, it has a combination of butter and honey (admittedly mixed  with custard) which strikes a chord. The medieval club I am active in  has a long tradition of serving honey butter for feasts despite the fact  there is no evidence for the practice. This has, by now, passed into  folklore and will continue despite this. Here, though, at least we have  something a bit like it.\n\nI will continue working on the document and try to draw some more conclusions.\n\nThe recipe collection from the monastery at Tegernsee (Bavaria) is an  unusual source. It seems to have been produced to serve very specific  practical purposes in the administration of that particular monastery,  giving quantities for dishes and instructing the reader on which days  what is to be served. A calendar and a short treatise on fishes are  written in the same manuscript, the whole produced around 1500 and in  use until at least 1534. The text was partially edited by Anton  Birlinger in Germania 9/1864 ( pp. 192-207) who regarded it as a  resource for linguistic study.

Roll out an egg  dough with a rolling pin so it is the thickness of half a finger. Cut it  in cubes like (i.e. the size of) beans and throw the dough into hot  fat. It fries quickly. Pour off the fat and leave them to dry. Put them  in a sauce or other condiment and let the wine sauce boil up before you  put in the beans. Guard it from moisture (read*** **nassen** ***for*** **naschen*****) and you can keep them for a long time.***\n\nAgain, there is a parallel in Meister Hans where the recipe is known as beans made of dough:\n\n***96*** ***Beans made of dough***\n\n***Item roll out a dough with a rolling pin (wallczn) so  that it is a finger thick. Cut it in cubes like beans and throw the  dough into hot fat. Let it fry quickly. Pour off the fat and let it dry.  And make this with saffron (sauce?) or spicy sauce, and let it boil up  before you put the beans into it. These are called beans (made) of  dough. Guard them from mice, and you may keep them a long time this way.***\n\nThese are functionally a kind of *Backerbsen*, though made from a firmer dough than [the ones in the Inntalkochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/27/proto-backerbsen-from-the-inntalkochbuch/).  Making them is fairly straighforward: you fry small pieces of an  egg-based dough and serve them in a spicy sauce. I think the final dish  is meant to be quite solid, with the dough pieces predominating \u2013 more  like mac and cheese than noodle soup. If thiosd was served quickly, they  would retain their crunch and could be quite pleasing, if strange to  us. \n\nThe name the Mondseer Kochbuch gives the dish is definitely surprising. *Nonnenf\u00fcrzle* were familiar throughout Germany by the sixteenth century and seem to have described [a sweet gingerbread-like confection](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonnenf%C3%BCrzle). Today, the word describes a choux paste fritter, most likely related closely to the French[ *pets des nonnes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun%27s_puffs). These do not seem related to either, though it is possible that the dough referred to here is meant to be a choux paste. The [principle ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/08/a-possible-choux-pastry-recipe/)was [familiar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/10/an-odd-recipe-from-the-innsbruck-ms/).  It would make them fluffier and spongier, but there is no indication in  the recipe that that is what the writer intended. The suggestion to  keep them militates against it.  \n\nFinally, there is an interesting illustration of how the transmission  process worked in the final sentence. The recipe in Meister Hans  advises the reader to guard the finished product from mice. The Mondseer  Kochbuch in this case looks to be the corrupted version, stating they  should be protected from *naschen*. Aichholzer suggests to amend this to *nassen*, wetness, which is reasonable. Fried dough needs to be kept dry. However, *naschen* \u2013 roughly, food thieving or snacking \u2013 also makes sense. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

A recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sl5597o2dw6c1.jpg?width=1490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de203da60cb6f5c044f008f229367acd5a80fc9b\n\n***146 To prepare Kugel pip***\n\n***Item peel sour apples, slice them thin, and cook them in  fat until they are soft.

Brush it with (fat and serve it in?) a bowl and serve it. This is called a kugelpipp. You can also fill krapfen with the same apples.***\n\nThe dish looks fairly straightforward, a [folded pancake](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/07/filled-sheets-of-eggs-a-complex-fritter/) with an[ apple filling](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/02/apple-preserve-and-a-fritter/)  that is fried. We\u2019ve seen similar things elsewhere. Unlike with other  examples, the apple filling is not sweet. Apples fried in fat and spiced  will only be as sweet as the original fruit, and many old varieties are  quite tart. But again, savoury apple dishes were not uncommon. The idea  that fruit equals sweet is a modern affectation. \n\nWe are left guessing about a few points. The \u201csheet of eggs\u201d could be  an egg-based pancake batter or just eggs. Both interpretations are  plausible. We also do not know how it was folded. Simply folding it in  half would work if the filling is sticky enough, though I like to  imagine something like a [galette Bretonne](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/buckwheat-crepe-madames).  But on  the whole, it is fairly straightforward. I imagine it will be quite rich. \n\nThe name, though, is quite puzzling. Aichholzer renders it as *Gugelhupf* in her modern German translation, but it is hard to see the justification for that. [*Gugelhupf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gugelhupf)[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gugelhupf#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldstein2015312%E2%80%93313-3)is a cake and always seems to have been one. Neither is it easy to see where the connection with either a *Gugel* (a hood) or a *Kugel* (a  sphere) would come in. I cannot explain it. Notably, though, the  parallel recipe in Meister Hans (mistakenly combining two into one) uses  an entirely different, but equally confusing designation: *Gabel supp* (fork soup) \n\n***Recipe #85*** ***Ain gabel supp mach***\n\n***Prepare a fork soup***\n\n***Item peel sour apples, slice them thinly, boil them in water and pour off the water. Add eggs, flour, and seasonings (gekr\u00e4utt) to the apples and prepare a dough. Make fritters (krapffn).  Peel sour apples and slice them thinly. (Cook them) in fat, let the  apples fall apart entirely, add ginger and fry it in fat. Prepare a  pancake (plat) of eggs and pour the apples on it while it is in  the pan. Let it fry in a little fat until it turns red (browns) at the  bottom. Brush it with eggs. Set it in a bowl and serve it. This is  called a fork soup (gabel suppn) and you can also fill fritters (krappfen) with the same apples.***\n\nI guess it is one more illustration of the general aversion to nondescriptive names German recipe writers seem to have had. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria).

And dried white bread.  Make a powder of all of this. When you wish to eat it, temper it with  wine or with vinegar. You can keep this as long as you wish, and it is  called dry sauce.***\n\nThis is, again, clearly the same recipe despite a few differences. Meister Hans has:\n\n***A green sauce, make it thus and keep it***\n\n***Item take sage and onions, parsley and sorrel old and  young. Pick the herbs and wash them and dry them in the sun. Take with  that pepper, galingale, ginger, cinnamon, anise, coriander, cubebs,  cloves, mace, grains of paradise, and a little artickel (unknown),  that makes the sage nice. And take dried white bread and make a powder  of all of this. When you wish to eat it, temper it with wine or with  vinegar. And keep (store) this as long as you please.***\n\nThere are some points in whichg the sauces differ. Most saliently,  the version in Meister Hans has onions as a primary ingredient while  that from the  Mondseer Kochbuch has mint and pennyroyal in addition to  sage, parsley, and sorrel. I cannot see how this is anything other than  intentional. There is also nutmeg rather than mace in the list of  spices, but that is a matter of omitting or adding a single short word  in German, so it can easily happen in transmission. Finally, the mystery  word *artickel* is replaced by *kes* which what is  clearly, but bafflingly cheese. I suppose a hard cheese like Schabziger  or Pecorino could serve in this capacity. It might well make the final  sauce a little more like a pesto. It could be worth trying out. \n\nAgain, this contrast does not help us answer the chicken and egg  problem. Neither the recipe in Meister Hans nor that in the Mondseer  Kochbuch look like they are corrupted copies of the other. Both make  sense on their own terms. I still think there is a shared source  somewhere in the early 1400s.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

Pour it onto a serving bowl and let it cool, take off the skin,  and serve it with wine or with cold milk, as you please, and serve it.***\n\nThe cooking instructions here are clear enough, but I am at a loss what the functionn of this dish was. The word [*gei\u00dflitz* ](http://www.mhdwb-online.de/wb.php?link_id=61845000)does  not help, it is a fairly common term for a porridge which this clearly  is not. Cooking ground raisins and gingerbread with honey and spices is  how other [recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/02/honey-sauce-for-fish-from-cgm-384-ii/)[produce ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/26/three-recipes-for-sauce-and-serving-bread/)[sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/08/gingerbread-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551/).  However, given the instruction to serve it with cold milk suggests it  was more akin to an almond cheese or similar  show dish, served with  a  liquid component to be spooned up. I guess, depending on the proportion  of gingerbread and wine, this could make an attractive combination \u2013 a   thick, sweet and spicy paste served with cold milk like a very adult  Rote Gr\u00fctze. But this is very far into speculative territory, especially  since the dish is described as \u2018grey\u2019, suggesting it is mixed with the  milk. \n\nIncidenbbtally, I also do not know what to make of the *schifflein* of gingerbread. Aichholzer reads them as *scheiblein* \u2013  slices \u2013 which is plausible, but the specification that other  gingerbread could be used if they were unobtainable gives me pause.  Surely, any gingerbread could be sliced. It may refer to some sort of  gingerbread sold in a specific shape, something that still happens  commonly with baked goods in Germany. As to its  spercific qualities, I  have no idea. [Medieval gingerbread, as far as we can tell](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/gingerbread-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-2/), was harder than far more strongly seasoned than our familiar variety. That is about all I can say on this count. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

Cut them in slices (I think this means  halves) and cut out the core. But then take other apples, peel them  cleanly, cut out the cores, and chop these apples very small on a  chopping board. Take a pan and put in enough honey, also put in the  chopped apples and stir it with a spoon over the fire. It boils and  turns brown. That is the filling for the filled apples. Then take the  sliced apples and the filling and spread the filling on one side. Cover  it with the other slice that was cut from the (same) apple and press  them together. Now you have a filled apple. Prepare as many of these as  you please. Take flour in a bowl, pour wine into it and prepare a batter  that is not too thin, but also do not make it too thick. Salt it very  little, colour it yellow with saffron, and then take fat, butter, or  oil. Take the filled apples, turn them around in the batter, and throw  them into the pan. See that there is oil or fat in it and fry them well  and cleanly, then you have good filled apples.***\n\n***93 Filled wafers***\n\n***If you wish to prepare a different dish from the same  filling, take wafers and cut them square, as (large as) you please. Take  of the same filling and spread it on one side. Cover it with another  wafer and press it together cleanly. Now take it and dip it into the  batter with its sides all around, thus it will hold together and be  white in the middle. Throw them into the pan and let them fry in  whatever you please (i.e. in oil, butter, or fat), thus they will turn  out good. But do not leave them in the pan for too long so they do not  turn black.***\n\n***94 Filled apples on a spit***\n\n***But if you wish to prepare another dish with that  filling, that is the third, take applews and peel them cleanly. Cut then  in slices and then cut them small, as small as a penny or wider. Now  take the same filling that you had the first time and make small cakes (*****k\u00fcchel*****)  from it it. Cut small skewers like straws, a span long, and first stick  on a slice of apples and then a ball (of the filling) between, always  one after the other. And take of the same batter you had before for the  second recipe, and wine must be in it. Take fat or butter and do as in  the first recipe. When you have fried it, take the skewers out, slice  them (the fritters) lengthwise with a sharp knife, and set them on a  bowl. Thus you have the three dishes. Each is different from the others,  and they are made with one filling.***\n\nWhile filled, baked apples (*Brat\u00e4pfel*) are still a staple of  German wintertime cooking, many of the medieval recipes that survive  are batter-coated and deep-fried. That is probably owed to the fact that  recipe collections rarely record the quotidian. These [are often elaborate preparations](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/14/fried-filled-apples-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) suitable for a lordly table. The idea of filling an apple with a honey-apple paste is interesting, but not uncommon. [A very similar recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/14/fried-filled-apples-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) is found, for example, in the [Kuchenmaistrey](https://books2read.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach). A similar apple-honey condiument known as *doberiz* or *deweriz* also  shows up in a number of recipe collection, not least the Mondseer  Kochbuch itself. It is described as lasting long, so it could actually  have been on hand in well-appointed households. This is Meister Hans\u2019  take on it:  \n\n***Recipe #82*** **Ain Condiment haist dewericz**  \n***A sauce that is called*** **dewericz** ***Item take a sour apple after St Martin\u2019s Day (11 November), peel them and cut them apart. Then lay them in a honey beverage (*****h\u00f6nig tranck*****). Let it boil so that it turns brown. You may keep this for a year. This sauce is called*** **dewericz*****. You may also fill*** **krapfen** ***(small pastries) with it.***\n\nThe first recipe is a fairly straighforward preparation, halved  apples with a filling in the middle that are battered and fried. We have  a number of similar ones, including some [very early descriptions](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/25/eleventh-century-baked-apples/). The second, too, is nothing unusual. Putting a sweet filling between wafers (or,[ in a pinch, sage leaves](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/01/sage-fritters-from-the-new-book/)) was common currency in German kitchens of the Middle Ages. The third belongs to a class of [very elaborate fritters that are often cut open before serving](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/07/filled-sheets-of-eggs-a-complex-fritter/)  to reveal their complex and sometimes colourful internal structure.  This is an early instance, but there is no reason to assume the concept  was new at the time just because they do not show up in written sources.  \n\nIt is interesting from an organisational perspective that these three  recipes are grouped together here because the principle that connects  them \u2013 using the same filling \u2013 is attractive from a perspective of  labour economy more than that of diners invested in variety. The  Mondseer Kochbuch is no cookbook in the modern sense, but at some level  there clearly was input by someone who cared about running an efficient  kitchen. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

Twelve  half breadrolls, and a small cake on each skewer. And then boiled milk  with eggs and well coloured with saffron, pour it into a cloth and weigh  it down with stones until it is dry.

Flowers cut  from egg white strewn into the head. Small fried cakes are set around  the fladen on skewers.*** \n\nIt is very clear immediately that both the Mondseer Kochbuch and the  Buoch von guoter Spise devote an inordinate amount of space to these *fladen*. No other recipe collection I know of does. The recipes from the *Buoch von guoter Spise*,  though, are more numerous, more detailed, and far more elaborate,  suggesting that the Mondseer Kochbuch omitted parts of an original  source that the *Buoch* retains. Some recipes \u2013 specifically #88,  91 and 93 \u2013 clearly are parallels. Others do not show up in the  Mondseer Kochbuch, though the first recipe there involving quinces also  does not feature in the *Buoch von guoter Spise*. Generally, the  instructions here are more detailed than in the Mondseer Kochbuch,  telling us for example that the sheet is indeed made of dough, that eggs  are slid into holes in the fladen prior to baking, and that the hollow  roast of liver which the Mondseer Kochbuch also describes is destined to  go on a *fladen* at all.\n\nWhat is entirely absent from the Mondseer Kochbuch is the series of increasingly elaborate presentation pieces based on *fladen*.  It is from these we learn that these must have been quite substantial,  thick enough to hold up skewers and large enough for various dishes to  be laid out on them. In #89, pig\u2019s and calves\u2019 feet are laid under the  filling and presumably baked into it to be pulled out at the table and  eaten. Recipes #92  and 93 feature small chicken pastries decoratively  arranged on the base of the meat fladen. Even if we assume that some  effort could have gone into decorating these, they pale in comparison to  the truly lavish displays in #94 and #95, though.  \n\nI am not entirely sure how to read these recipes, but I suspect they  describe one full display of foods each rather than a series of dishes  or options.  In #94, a thick fladen has large skewers stuck into it that  support half roasts and a pastry case (though it is possible this is  placed on top of the fladen, maybe between the skewers). Breadrolls and  cakes are arranged around it and a fence of sliced strips of hard  custard built around the edge. Finally, this is decorated with leaves  and fried birds \u2013 presumably small songbirds \u2013 and served along with a  roast heron. It is possible that the platter with the heron is meat to  balance atop the central skewers, or indeed that they hold up the bird  in some artful arrangement.\n\nThe final recipe referred to as an infidel head indeed puts not one,  but two \u2018heads\u2019 on a fladen base, in this case with cubed apples mixed  into the meat. The pastry \u2018head\u2019 may  be no more than a reference to a  pastry case, referred to in Latin texts of the 14th century as a *testa*,  but it could equally well be a representation of an actual head. The  calf\u2019s head, parboiled, roasted and basted, most likely goes directly on  the fladen since it is hard to see how the skewers would hold up its  weight. Decorated with hard-boiled egg yolks like an apple in the mouth  of a roast piglet and flowers cut from egg whites, it must have been  quite a sight. Surrounding the entire thing with a stockade of fritters  on skewers almost seems superfluous. \n\nThis  enormous concentration of animal protein and fat seems vulgar  to us, but we should be careful not to imagine it as a primitive  display. Dough can easily be arranged decoratively, and even a simple  fladen reimagined with an egg wash and a braided edge, or a pretty  pattern of pear slices arranged on it, becomes a feast for the eyes as  well as the stomach. Alongside the labour of chopping the meat filling  by hand, the effort involved seems almost trivial. The skewers, too,  need not have been coarse pieces of wood. Early Modern Central Europe  was home to entire cottage industries based on people with time and  sharp knives, so we can easily picture these pieces carved and  patterned. With little carved flowers or green leaves to add  flashes of  colour, the whjole thing could have been quite sophisticated, though it  is hard to see how it got to the table anywhere near as hot as the  plainer *fladen* are meant to be served.

Today, there are two recipes for a classic dish that any other tradition would call blancmanger.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5ypo2y60mvb1.jpg?width=567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfc9a379586a1157557b864cd28524143284b080\n\n***71 A spoon dish (muos) of almond milk, rice, and chicken breasts***\n\n***Take almond milk (that is) thick and chicken breasts that are pulled apart (gezeiset) and put them into the almond milk.

Stir them  with rice flour and egg yolks and add enough fat and strew on enough  sugar. This is called*** **Pulverisei**.\n\nThe *Buoch von guoter Spise* once again has close parallels, but it uses the familiar name:\n\n***76 A*** **blamensir**\n\n***If you wish to prepare a*** **blamenser**, ***take thick almond milk and chicken breasts that are torn apart (geceyset) and put that into the almond milk. Stir it with rice flour and enough fat, and add enough sugar. That is a*** **blamenser**.\n\n***77 A*** **blamensir**\n\n***A*** **blamenser** ***made of chickens torn apart (geceysten h\u00fcenern)  on the chest.  And prepare good almond milk. Chicken stirred in, then  serve the almond milk with rice flour and passed-through violet flowers.  Add enough fat and boil it until it is done, and add enough sugar. That  is also called a*** **blamenser**.\n\n***A thickened (gestocketen)*** **blamenser** ***is made with thick, curdled (z\u00e4me) almond milk. (Take) torn-apart  (geceyset)  chicken breasts and throw them into the milk and boil them up, and stir  them with rice flour and egg yolks. Add enough fat and strew on enough  sugar. This is called a*** **gestockter blamenser**.\n\nIf we needed more evidence of the oddity this represents, it is [provided in recipe #3](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/12/a-misspelling-or-whey-blanc-manger/): Oonce again, the Mondseer Kochbuch settles on a  circumlocution to define what the *Buoch von guoter Spise* calls a *blamenser*.  Clearly, there is conscious effort at work. The question is why, and I  honestly have no idea. Perhaps a copyist of the recipes disliked the  French associations of the name, or there really was some kind of bias  against naming dishes. We know that German epic poets systematically  omitted descriptions of food when they adapted French material. A  similar discomfort with culinary ostentation could be at work here. But  of course this would be counteracted by inventing the Latinate word *Pulverisei*.\n\nThe recipes themselves are also mildly interesting. Clearly, the  concept of a blamensir had already removed itself far enough from its  roots as a \u2018white food\u2019 that a violet or yellow dish can qualify in the  Buoch von guoter Spise. The parallel recipe in the Mondseer Kochbuch is  not just notably shorter, only including the version with egg yolks, it  also fails to mention the base is thickened almond milk. This may have  gone without saying, or it may indicate a *Pulverisei* was made with dairy, not almond milk, in this case. Again, we cannot say for sure.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely.

She  requested something with fruit, and there being raspberries available,  that was what we used in place of the more usual, but out-of-season  strawberries.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0slnte4xd1ub1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de9bdfcf5f5d1e67c386fad44ee3f39c736f0242\n\n \n\nWe are in the same history club, but the recipe I used was thoroughly modern. It still reminded me of one I had [posted](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/06/strawberry-tart-and-why-varietals-matter/) a [long time ago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/30/fruit-tart-with-forest-strawberries/):\n\n***Take eggs, the yolks alone or all together as you wish,  beat and whip them well, then take good thick cream that is sweet, stir  in as much as there are eggs, add rosewater if you wish, grind of  almonds what is right and pass it through (a cloth) with the cream, but  in that case take a little more of the milk (cream) than of the eggs.  Hold it over a bright fire, but far away, stir it diligently until it  begins to thicken a little, but do not let it boil. Then the dish  (pastry) should be ready, and it should not be too high, half as high as  another tart is. Then pour the mix into it and place nice strawberries  or gooseberries in it so that they are half in the mass and half  sticking out, and strew it well with sugar so that you neither see the  mass nor the berries. The strawberries should be washed in rosewater and  not too ripe, for then they turn to mush immediately, but the  gooseberries are fine and right when they are already yellow and clear.  They need much sugar. Bake them well and give a lot of heat below, but  not too much above so that they stay nicely white. It is enough quickly.  If you bake them in an oven, lay a piece of paper on top.***\n\nThis is from 1598 and clearly not what we think of as Erbeerkuchen  today, but it still comes surprisingly close with its custard base and  the sugar covering the fruit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1sn9py76e1ub1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fcdbcfa93c41c12ff2d0e6a4a99fd81e9068827\n\n \n\nThe thought of maybe tracing the ancestry of modern strawberry cake  intrigued me and I decided to do some digging. What I found was mostly  that there were many variations of putting strawberries on cakes, but  the modern version seems to be very recent. The [*Brandenburgisches Koch*buch of 1723](https://digitale.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/vd18/content/titleinfo/7537989) (which is itself a pirated edition of [Die wohl-unterwiesene K\u00f6chin](https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/17730/1) by [Maria Sophia Schellhammer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sophia_Schellhammer)) does not include  any recipe for  strawberry tart, but has instructions for currants (p. 295), gooseberries and [brambles ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/20/on-brambles/)(p. 296): \n\n***Currant Tart. This is the best way***\n\n***You pluck the currants from their stalks, wash them, and lay them in the crust. Add to this a***  **N\u00f6ssel** ***of sweet cream, rosewater, six eggs, sugar, and a*** **Pfennig** ***worth of*** **Semmel** ***bread. But this must first be all beaten well together before pouring it over the currants.*** \n\n***Gooseberry Tart***\n\n***You must strew sugar, clarified butter, Semmel crumbs and pounded cinnamon between them.***\n\n***Bramble Tart***\n\n***When you have placed one layer of brambles in it, you  must strew sugar, cinnamon, and butter over it, then brambles again and  so forth until the pan is full.*** \n\nAside from the currant tart, which looks like a  distant relative of  the custard described by Anna Wecker, these are very basic fruit pies of  the kind we still find very commonly in the United States. They are not  at all like Erdbeerkuchen. Neither is the recipe for a tart of  strawberries or raspberries (#565) in Markus Looft\u2019s 1758  Nieders\u00e4chsisches Kochbuch: \n\n***Strawberry or Raspberry Tart***\n\n***The strawberries or raspberries are only cleaned and then  poured out on as sieve so they dry nicely. Then they are mixed with a  little sugar, pounded cinnamon, and chopped lemon peel. You may also add  a little pounded  biscuit into it, especially into the raspberries  which are juicier. Then they are only put into a tarte with flasky crust  (*****Bl\u00e4tterteig*****), thus it is proper.*** \n\nThis is not very different at all, though the side note that  raspberries are juicier than strawberries indicates that the  strawberries referenced here are the European forest variety, not early  forms of our modern cultivars, despite the fact that strawberry  cultivation was pioneered in Northern Germany. The 1831 Hamburgisches  Koch-Buch (XIV.20) goes a different way, even more reminiscent of   American pies:\n\n***Cherry Tart***\n\n***You must first remove the stones from the cherries and  then place them in a  casserole with a good piece of butter and let them  cook a little so the juice comes out. Then you remove the  cherries  with a skimmer and boil the cherry soup or juice with a little pounded  biscuit, pounded cinnamon, and finely chopped lemon peel to make it  thick. Then the cherries are returned to it, boiled up once together,  and set aside to cool. They are then worked into a tart with fine crust.  Strawberries and raspberries are prepared the same way. You can also  strew biscuit on the  bottom of the tart instead of between the fruit,  but alsdo pounded almonds.*** \n\nIt is not quite a pie filling yet, lacking the cornstarch binder for  one thing, but it is fairly close. I dread to imagine how raspberries or  modern cultivated strawberries would respond to this treatment. But for  many generations it seems German cooks used berries to make something  more and more like pie. But by the middle of the 19th century, something  different shows up. The 1844 Der Dresdner Koch by Johann Friedrich  Baumann (vol. II p. 155) gives instructions for serving raw strawberries  on vol-au-vents:\n\n***Small*** **Bl\u00e4tterkrustchen** ***with strawberries / Petits vol-au-vents glac\u00e9s au gros sucre garni de fraises***\n\n***The*** **Bl\u00e4tterkrustchen** ***are dipped in sugar syrup as before and immediately strewn with white coarse sugar. Eight*** **Loth** ***of  sugar are are then added to the sugar syrup and a little strawberry  juice pressed out is poured on it, boiled up, skimmed, and set aside as  soon as it forms a very fine (short) thread between the fingers. When  they are served, these*** **Krustchen** ***are filled with nice fresh strawberries and the strawberry syrup, or otherwise plain white syrup, is poured over them. These*** **Krustchen** ***are similarly prepared with raspberries or with white or red currants.*** \n\nThese are clearly not Erdbeerkuchen, but the use of either white or  red syrup over fresh fruit is reminiscent of modern Tortenguss and  the  flavour for fresh fruit is valued here. As an aside, *Bl\u00e4tterkrustchen* for  vol-au-vent is a less than stellar example of Baumann\u2019s otherwise quite  impressive project of translating the vocabulary of emerging haute  cuisine into German. \n\nJohann Rottenh\u00f6fer\u2019s 1866 Anweisung in der feineren Kochkunst (#2023)  has a very similar treament for fruit served on a cake base:\n\n***Strawberry Cake / flan aux fraises***\n\n***2 1/4 litres of good forest strawberries are picked over  meticuluosly, placed in 3/10 litre good thick sugar syrup and swung  once, then, if possible, placed on ice. Meanwhile, a flat cake based on  dough #1967 is prepared, baked to light brown, and set on a tart sheet.  Shortly before serving, the strawberries are placed on the cake, spread  out evenly, and immediately brought to the table.*** \n\nDough #1967 is a rich short crust:\n\n***Short Crust (*****M\u00fcrber Teig*****) in a different way, also known as Br\u00f6selteig  / Pate bris\u00e9e d\u2019une autre mani\u00e8re***\n\n***The same consists of 560 grammes of fine, dry flour, 420  grammes of butter, eight egg yolks, one coffee spoon of pounded  cinnamon, 70 grammes of pounded sugar, and one knife tip of salt. It is  worked as the preceding (i.e. quickly by hand) and wrapped in a cloth  whereupon you allow it to rest for an hour prior to use.*** \n\nThis is clearly an ancestor of our Erdbeerkuchen. Small berry  tartlets are still commonly made on short crust rather than the more  common spongy cake today. The first instance of what is  cleartly modern  *Erdbeerkuchen* I know of occurs in Meta Adam\u2019s Hamburger  Kochbuch, here taken from the 1949 edition that must have seemed like  cruel mockery to many readers at the time:\n\n***Strawberry Tart***\n\n***Ingredients: Short crust, Vanilla cr\u00e8me of 1/4 litre  milk, 25 grammes of*** **Maizena** ***or*** **Mondamin** ***(starch),  2  tablespoons sugar, 1 piece vanilla, Topping: 1 kg strawberries,  120-150 grammes sugar, 2 tablespons starch, 2 sheets white gelatin***\n\n***Bake short crust. Fill with vanilla cr\u00e8me. Remove the  flowers (stems) from the strawberries, sugar them and allow the juice to  be  drawn out. drain! Lay out the strawberries on the vanilla cream,  bind the juice with potato starch and gelatin, and pour over the  strawberries.*** \n\nIt is interesting I have not found this in any of the classic 20th-century go-to books. *Dr Oetker\u2019s Backbuch* does not have it, neither does Krackhart, Davidis, Prato, *Das Blaue Kochbuch*, Grete Willinsky\u2019s *Kochbuch der B\u00fcchergilde*, or *1001 Kochvorschriften*. Erna Horn\u2019s *Der neuzeitliche Haushalt*  (1941 edition) has recipes for gelatin used to cover fruit on cakes and  a leavened, but still crusty base for Obstkuchen. However, there is no  indication of a cream or custard layer and her recipe for strawberry  cake bakes the fruit encased in whipped egg whites much as  Krackhart  does in 1898. It looks like the  combination of these specific elements  happened sometime around 1930-1940 in northern Germany and spread out  from there. Today, pre-packaged *Tortenguss* and pre-baked cake  bases are staples of any supermarket throughout the country and  thousands of families enjoy a quick and easy Erdbeerkuchen every summer  weekend. I usually make my own base using the 5-4-3-2-1 method. A  close  friend, originally from the Rhineland, taught it to me:\n\nQuickly mix 5 tablepoons of sugar, 4 tablespoons of flour, 3 eggs, 2  tablespoons of oil, 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of baking  powder. Bake in a flat springform pan at 180\u00b0C until light brown, remove  and cool. \n\nThis base can be flavoured as desired with vanilla, cocoa, or rum. Vanilla custard is spread on it (instant *Vanillepudding* mix is customary), the cooling mass covered in fruit, and the gelling *Tortenguss* spead  over it. If you are feeling artistic, closing the springform around the  base again allows you to cast a layered cylinder of cake, custard,  fruit, and gelatin, encasing the fruit in a block of jelly. I don\u2019t  particularly like to, but it looks very 1990s.

{"title": "Honey-Ginger-Garlic Sauce", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/24/honey-ginger-garlic-sauce/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/24/honey-ginger-garlic-sauce/)\n\n I apologise again for my long absense \u2013 it was a busy week, and then I  had the pleasure of spending the weekend in the company of a new friend  helping with a wonderful history-inspired feast. I learned a lot about  different approaches to food, art, accuracy and pleasure which you will  hear about in due time. Today, there is a sauce recipe from the Mondseer  Kochbuch, possibly the first mention of a cook in the German corpus by  name:  \n\n \n\n***45 How to prepare Snalenberger sauce***\n\n***Take wine and thick honey and let it boil. Add ground  ginger, more than pepper, and pound garlic, but not too much. Make it  strong (season it strongly) and stir it with a piece of wood (*****ainer schinnen*****). Let it boil until it begins to burn. You shall eat this in cold winter.***\n\nAgain, this is not an isolate. This is one of the recipes we also find in the [*Buoch von Guoter Spise*](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (#49) where it reads thus: \n\n***A good sauce***\n\n***Take wine and thick honey, set it on the fire and let it  boil. Add pounded ginger, more than pepper. Pound garlic, but not too  much, and make it strong. And stir it with a length of wood (*****eyer schinen*****). Let it  boil until it begins to brown (*****br\u00fcnnien*****). You shall eat this in cold weather. It is called*** **swallenergs salse*****.*** \n\nIn culinary terms, the contrast of honey and wine, ginger and garlic  sounds promising. Balancing the sharp heat, pungency, and rich sweetness  could give you something reminiscent of Southern Chinese cuisine if it  is done right. The profusion of warming spices maskes this humorally  suited for cold weather, and all ingredients would have been available  in winter. The Mondseer Kochbuch and the *Buoch von Guoter Spise*  share a number of honey-based sauces, as we will see. This appears to  be a feature of this particular tradition, perhaps a regional  specificity or early fashion. \n\nAs to who Swallenberg (or Snalenberg) was, we have no idea. Both  geography and the use of the -s genitive suggest that it is a person,  not a place, but beyond that we are entirely at a loss. Eminent food  historian Trude Ehlert suggested this may be the name of a cook honoured  as its inventor, and the suggestion is not implausible. The person  could equally well be a patron known to have had this sauce prepared or  for serving it to his guests, or a physician or apothecary who  recommended it. Many culinary names come about when famous people are  credited with \u2018inventing\u2019 a dish. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

This is also called Agrest.***\n\nThis is basically variations on the theme of *verjus* or *agresta*, the sour juice of unripe grapes (or other fruit). It is interesting that two are specifically identified as *Agrest* which was the Latin and Italian term for it (*agresta*).  It may indicate this is a recently imported idea at this point, but  equally it may just be an explanation for the upper-class reader to use  the correct term (and not whatever the kitchen staff may have called  it). The preparation is not unknown \u2013 there is even a [fairly direct parallel for #32](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/02/two-sauces-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) in the [K\u00f6nigsberg MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Konigsberg-Manuscript.pdf)  \u2013 but a sauce that is neither thickened nor cooked is unusual in the German corpus of culinary sources.\n\nThe flavour combinations are also engrossing: Sour graped  and apples  or crabapples are just sour, but the addition of parsley is intriguing  enough and the combinations of garlic, sage, and verjuice or shallots,  sage, and vinegar sound worth experimenting with. Incidentally, the word  *aslauch*/*aschlauch* probably refers to shallots, but it  can also mean chives and in later recipes clearly does. It does suggest  that if shallots are meant, they may have been preferred green and  fresh rather than dry.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

Take the middle piece once it has been roasted fully and pound it in a  mortar. Add the black crust of rye bread that has been soaked in vinegar  beforehand.

Lay it (the fish) in  (when it is) cold.***\n\nThere are numerous recipes for preserving meats by immersing them in  thick sauces, effectively excluding bacteria. Most of these sauces also  included vinegar which would further reduce spoilage. Here, we have  another early example, though this time involving fish. [Lampreys were](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/30/instructions-for-boiling-fish/) [fashionable](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/15/about-lampreys-from-the-oeconomia/)  throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, though most surviving  recipes describe how to prepare them fresh. This is an unusual  occurrence, but as the same source in a different recipe for such a  preservative sauce specifically instructs the reader to apply the  process creatively, not an unexpected one. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria).

This is from the account of the [German landsknecht Hans Staden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Staden)  who served the Portuguese crown in Brazil in the 1550s. He spent a  considerable time as a captive of the Tupinamba and made his  observations during this time the centrepiece of his account which was  printed in German in 1557. Staden\u2019s account is most well known for his  lurid (and possibly fictitious) descriptions of cannibalism, but his  observations on life among the Native Americans are quite valuable. Here  is what he says about processing and preparing cassava flour which he  refers to as *Mandioka*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rgos9s373mb1.jpg?width=913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f7d686fc1f96d396c01d924e795e83f766aca49\n\n***Firstly they grate them on a stone to very small crumbs.  Then they press out the juice with a thing made from palm branch skins  called*** **tippiti** ***that way it becomes dry. Then they rub it through a sieve and bake thin cakes of that flour.***\n\n***The thing in which they dry and bake their flour is baked  from clay and shaped like a large bowl. They also take the roots fresh  and lay them in water, let them rot in it, then take them out and lay  them over the fire into the smoke. Let them dry. They call the dry roots***  **Keinrima**, ***they last long and when they wish to use them, they  pound them in a mortar of wood that way it becomes as white as white  flour. Of this they make the cakes called*** **Byyw**.\n\n***They also take well rotted Mandioka before they dry it  and mix it with dried and with fresh and dry the flour of that. That  lasts a year and is good to eat and they call that flour*** **Vythan**\n\n***They also make flour of fish and meat, they do it thus,  they roast the meat or fish above the fire in the smoke and let it  become all dry. Then they pluck it apart and still dry it once again  over the fire in vessels which they burned for that purpose called*** **Yneppaun**.  ***Then they pound it small in a wooden mortar and searce it through a  sieve, that lasts very long. For they have no custom of salting fish or  meat. Such flour they then eat with the root flour and it tastes quite  good.***\n\nThis is not a very detailed description \u2013 the roughly contemporary  account of Jean de Lery is much more informative \u2013 but for many German  readers it was the first and only exposure they had to Native American  customs. It is also interesting in two regards: Firstly, it repeats the  observation by several European writers that [Native Americans do not use salt](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/01/lionel-wafer-describes-native-american-cooking/)  in their cooking. The second is the way in which it describes three  modes of treating cassava in parallel, without any evident hierarchy  between them. Most European observers considered the laborious method of  turning cassava root into dry flat cakes by grating, pressing, drying  and baking it the primary approach and refer to the others in passing if  at all. I suspect this reflects their perspective more than the reality  of Native American cuisine. Not only were they culturally primed to  look for bread as the main food, the dried cassava flour fitted their  notions of how to use an ingredient and was portable enough for sip\u2019s  supplies. It was clearly the form in which most European soldiers and  sailors encountered cassava, but I doubt the same was true for the  Tupinamba, the [Cuni](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/01/lionel-wafer-describes-native-american-cooking/), or the [Kalinago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/05/a-caribbean-feast-according-to-labat/).\n\nThe reference to a flour made of dried fish or meat is also  interesting and is similarly repeated in a number of sources. It makes  sense since meat is difficult to preserve in a tropical climate. I find  it hard to imagine what the experience of an unsalted, but highly spiced  cassava porridge mixed with intensely umami meat powder would have been  like, but the contrast to European habits could hardly be starker.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1694xj2/hans_staden_on_cassava/", "created_utc": 1693767086.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1694xj2/hans_staden_on_cassava/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

This time, the reverend father writes about treating the ginger they grew on Gouadeloupe:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnft2bx3mwkb1.jpg?width=1639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4bca6a0588845cd909f1fe50ccbb747f41508d5e\n\n***\u201cSpicers mix the ginger with pepper, a little cloves, and  cinnamon, and after they have ground it and passed it through a sieve,  they sell this under the name of sweet spices (*****\u00e9picerie douce*****),  and they sell it quite dear since they make sure that the ginger, the  market for which is brisk, makes up three fourths and more.***\n\n***\u2026***\n\n**Ginger is turned into confit** ***\u201c\u2026fit to serve honourable folk, you pick them long before they are mature (*****meur*****)  while they are still tender, while the fibres are not yet distinct from  the rest of its flesh, neither by their toughness nor by their colour,  which is always stronger than that of the rest. You rub them with straw  to remove the entire skin and cut them in slices \u2026 You leave them in  seawater for three or four days which you change twice a day, and then  for seven or eight days in freshwater which you also change twice every  24 hours. Then you let them boil in plenty of water for a good hour and  put them back into fresh water for another day. After they have been  taken out and drained, you place them in a weak syrup that is well  clarified and quite hot, but not boiling and leave them in it for 24  hours. After that time, you take them out and let them drain, and place  them in a stronger syrup than the previous, and you do this for three  days in a row. You discard all these syrups as unusable because they  absorb all the remaining acidity and excessively spicy (*****trop piquant*****)  flavour of the fruit. Finally, you place them in a syrup of strong  consistency that is well clarified. You leave them in this if you wish  to preserve them wet, but if you wish to preserve them dry, as I have  explained elsewhere speaking of preserving lemons*** ***and other fruit of the country.*** ***It  is certain that ginger which is treated this way loses its sharp and  biting flavour, but retains its warmth and its other good qualities.***\n\n\u2026\n\n***You know it is well made \u2026 when you see no colour but  amber, very clear and almost transparent, and it is tender under the  tooth without being soft, and its syrup is quite clear.***\n\n***That which the confituriers make for sale or the common people (*****menu peuple*****)  for their use is brown, the syrup dark, and the fruit so strong, so  harsh and biting that it is almost impossible to hold it on the tongue,  at least unless you are accustomed to it like those sort of people who  eat chili peppers like you eat a pear or an apple.\u201d***\n\nThis section from Labat\u2019s travel account contains three interesting  points. The first, and probably the least surprising, is the sale of  pre-mixed spice blends. [These are found in](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[ most medieval culinary sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/09/two-trisanet-recipes/), though they show up later and less often in the German ones than in either French or Italian. This *\u00e9picerie douce* is very similar to medieval [*poudre douce*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder-douce), a familiar flavour profile. \n\nThe second is  that people in the Caribbean imported quite  sophisticated cooking techniques and made the most of the easy  availability of inexpensive sugar. As an aside, this also confirms Labat  is quite the food snob. We enounter his judgemental voice repeatedly  throughout his work. As a member of the French upper class, raised in  Central France and well known for enjoying his food, we should not  expect anything else. \n\nThe [third is that](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/05/a-caribbean-feast-according-to-labat/) [not just Native Americans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/01/lionel-wafer-describes-native-american-cooking/),  but also some Europeans clearly had different ideas about what level of  spiciness was desirable in food. Reading the succession of soakings and  rinsings Labat puts ginger roots through, it sounds as though he is  trying to leach out most of the flavour. I have not tried this yet, but I  suspect it would result in something we would think of as insipid.  Meanwhile, some of the \u2018little people\u2019 (that is what peuple menu roughly  translated as) were quite proud of their tolerance for spiciness.  Surely, eating a raw chili cannot serve as anything but a demonstration  of spice cred. Imagining buccaneers as chiliheads, of course, pushes all  the right macho buttons.

Things are  improving rapidly, it looks like a very mild case, but right now I am  still missing my sense of smell and playing catch-up with the world  around me. Before the virus got me, I had prepared a few experimental  recipes for my birthday party and two of them were *Mus*. To be precise, [one from the Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/09/almond-cherry-mousse-new-source/):\n\n[Bramble Mus, cherry almond milk Mus, and fig in jelly](https://preview.redd.it/68hoaa8l6xjb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ca30fb263822d5896d0922a366198a482417cb1)\n\n***1 A spoon dish of almond milk, cherries, and rice***\n\n***You shall take a pound of almonds and pound them to milk, and cherries one*** **libra**, ***and pass them through a sieve and add the milk to it. Take a*** **fierdung** ***of  rice, that shall be pounded to flour, and add that to the milk. Then  take pure fat or bacon and melt that in a pan, and add to it half a*** **mark** ***of white sugar, and do not oversalt it.***\n\nThe other one was from the Kuchenmaistrey, the 1485 cookbook whose [English translation by me](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/01/sage-fritters-from-the-new-book/) is[ just now coming out](https://books2read.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach).\n\n***Item make a spoon dish of blackberries or of tart  cherries thus. Pound the blackberries or tart cherries in a mortar. Add  white bread and pass it through a cloth. Then take milk and flour and  stir them well together. Mix it together in the pan, set it over the  fire and, stir (t\u00fcr) it well and do not oversalt it. This will  be a brown spoon dish. Serve it and strew ginger on it. The pan should  be greased, or add fat so that it does not burn. If it is too thick, add  milk to it.***\n\n[I was careless with the ginger jar](https://preview.redd.it/157v6fbq6xjb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88cabcfaa7a19a9d5d477c76dac52c28adc87247)\n\nI decided to go with blackberries, for variety, because I [really](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/20/on-brambles/)[ like them](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/06/bramble-jam-in-history/), and because I was curious about the colour. Both turned out very nice.\n\n*Mus* is generally thought of as a  boring category of food,  and I tend to harbour the same prejudice though I try to combat it.  Modern cuisine is leery of anything that is too highly processsed, and a  mushy, spoonable consistency \u2013 the one shared characteristic of all  things *Mus* \u2013 is suspicious, if anything. That can cause us to  miss some interesting flavour and textures. Medieval Mus dishes have the  capacity to surprise, though admittedly some are bland.\n\nThe first one was a striking success, but I had expected it to be. It  is also quite close to modern expectations of a sweet pudding or  custard, so it is likely to workk well with today\u2019s diners. My main  uncertainty was the thickness of the almond milk used. In the end, I  opted for commercial almond milk (Mandeldrink) to ease the process. I  mixed it with the pureed cherries and the sugar, then added rice flour  mixed with a little of the liquid and boiled the whole. It worked out  well, the  colour came out quite striking and it tasted delicious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cherry red](https://preview.redd.it/iya385at6xjb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=193101858a9210fdc3337bd4f0d4fbfe23941a1a)\n\nThe second one had me worried. It is described specifically as a brown  dish after all, and with so many medieval foods being brown or beige,  that seemed a strage qualifier. With no guidance on proportion, I opted  to go with a heavy emphasis on the fruit: 300g fresh blackberries,  pureed, mixed with about a tablespoon of white breadcrumbs and a cup of  milk, and bound with about two tablespoons of wheat flour. I ended up  needing another cup of milk to stop it from sticking and burning, but I  was rewarded with a spoonable, firm dish of a strikingly purple colour.  Serving it with ginger as per the recipe gave me pause, so I provided  sugar on the side because I expected it to be quite inedible to modern  tastes. Nobody used any sugar. It may not have been the most popular  dish of the day (that was[ the chicken](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/20/birthday-chicken/)), but it was an unexpected success. Both *Mus* dishes were fruity and refreshing, not at all like what we stereotype medieval food as.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15zfpja/two_kinds_of_fruit_mus_15th_century/", "created_utc": 1692822645.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15zfpja/two_kinds_of_fruit_mus_15th_century/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Why did they rely on so much milk and bread in these old recipes?

More details to follow, but here is recipe  1:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pydmy7qy81hb1.jpg?width=408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=892f60fc32fe47aa4836a892aa5d3fe33ebbb09c\n\n***1 A spoon dish of almond milk, cherries, and rice***\n\n***You shall take a pound of almonds and pound them to milk, and cherries one*** **libra**, ***and pass them through a sieve and add the milk to it.

Then  take pure fat or bacon and melt that in a pan, and add to it half a*** **mark** ***of white sugar, and do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis recipe piqued my interest because it gives quantities for most  ingredients. The pound is a common trade weight across all of Germany,  with the *fierdung* or  *vierdung* meaning a quarter pound and the *mark* half a pound. I assume the *libra* is  simply the Latin rendering of pound here. Since a pound could vary  between 400 and 600 grammes regionally, there is still a degree of  uncertainty. We also do not know exactly that all measures relate to the  same system. It is possible that the *libra* specifically means apothecary weight and the *mark* currency weight while the *pfund* and *fierdung* refer  to local trade weights. But for all of that, we gewt a reasonable range  of  assumptions here. About 450 grammes of almonds turned into almond  milk (of unknown thickness, but likely quite thick), 450g of cherries  pureed and strained, 120 grammes of rice flour and 110 grammes of sugar  (assuming the C\u00f6lnische Mark as our base here).\n\nThe quantity is clearly not an individual portion. It is a dish to be  served to a company of diners whose number  would vary according to  situation and rank \u2013 an *essen*, in contemporary English use a  mess (that is where the Biblical \u201cmess of pottage\u201d and the mess hall  derive from). And it is quite sweet, as sweet as a modern dessert. That  makes it a very luxurious dish in an age when sugar was priced as a  spice. I think if I make this with a tarter variety of cherry, it is  likely to also be very good.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15m7ko5/almond_cherry_mousse/", "created_utc": 1691564247.0, "score": 4, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15m7ko5/almond_cherry_mousse/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Unlike the  Kuchenmaistrey, very little about this work is self-explanatory, so I  plan to eventually turn it into a book with a good deal of  cross-referencing, parallel sources, and historical background. That is  why I must ask everyone to be patient \u2013 this could take a while. But the  core stands, it will happen. \n\nWhile I am on the topic of Meister Hans, the collection includes a lot of interesting recipes including this gem: \n\n \n\n[Beef, from the Tacuinum Sanitatis \\(note the foot on the table\\)](https://preview.redd.it/8ukt5xuauxgb1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05531b0bff0fdfab6a965854a78d45304f3fa42e)\n\n***Recipe #285*** **Von ein sulcz ze machn das sy gern gestee**\n\n***To cause a galantine to gel readily***\n\n***Item take calves\u2019 feet and boil them until they can be  stirred to pieces (sich zer treibn lassen) like a spoon dish (muo\u00df).  Remove the bones and place it in a glazed dish, and let it harden like  glue (laim). When you wish to have galantine (sullcz), take from the  same powder and throw it in whenever you want in the year. Thus the  galantine will gel.***\n\nThis recipe is a reminder not to underestimate the ingenuity of our ancestors. There are many recipes for *sulcz* or *galray* in the German corpus, and, like their modern cognates *S\u00fclze* and *Gallert*, these can refer to aspics, though they do[ not always mean that](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/28/galray-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/).  Here, the intent is clearly to produce a gelatin-based aspic. This  seems to have been a novelty dish at the time, and technically  challenging. Cooks circulated a number of [foolproof ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/07/fish-jelly-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)[methods ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/16/advice-for-aspic-from-cgm-384-i/)[to ensure](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/22/meat-in-aspic-from-cgm-384-ii/) it would set. It remind me a bit of the mystique of the souffl\u00e9 in classical French cuisine. \n\nUsing calves\u2019 feet, the go-to base for gelatin in early modern times, was[ not unusual](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/04/calves-foot-jelly-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)  in itself. What is interesting here is that the gelatin is not prepared  fresly as it is needed, but made in advance, dried, and reduced to a  powder that could be usaed as needed. The promise that it would cause  the dish to gel \u201cwhenever you want in the year\u201d suggests good keeping  qualities. That is not really surprising in what is basically bone glue.  Moreover, it signals a great deal of confidence. Having gelatin set in  summer was always a dicey proposition without artificial refrigeration.  But most interestingly, it seems that some medieval cooks really could  just grab gelatin powder off the shelf, even if they had first made it  themselves.

Usually, early August is not yet quite the right time, but this  year the combination of hot days in June and a long rainy spell in July  produced an early harvest. After two hours of biking along forest paths  and railway embankments, I returned with a surprising three kilos of  fruit. They were turned into jam immediately.\n\n[Brambles along the RB82](https://preview.redd.it/0yp7hpf5jhgb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=107fd0469fa5a7099b265dc9d605784da74c04de)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[4.5 kilogrammes of bramble jam](https://preview.redd.it/iq9nlf28jhgb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff17b24babc4df26ca959ee3e0ac4cec5c897b7c)\n\nI [explained earlier why blackberries are so prevalent](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/20/on-brambles/)  wherever the railway runs and I can only  reinforce my advice to ladies  given there: If you have a prospective suitor, go bramble picking  together. There are few better tests of dexterity, tenderness of touch,  patience, and tolerance. Today, I want to look at the history of my  son\u2019s favourite breakfast treat: *Brombeermarmelade*.\n\nThe first thing we need to address is a language problem. Cooking  fruit to preserve them most likely is an ancient idea, but the concept  of *Marmelade* as a category is thoroughly modern. Technically,  it does not even exist since the trade designation for non-citrus fruit  cooked into a  breadspread with sugar [as of 1982](https://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?startbk=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl&jumpTo=bgbl182s1434.pdf#__bgbl__%2F%2F*%5B%40attr_id%3D%27bgbl182s1434.pdf%27%5D__1691318493750) is *Konfit\u00fcre.*  The word Marmelade, originally referring to a quince confection, can  now only be used to refer to citrus marmalade. Most Germans do not care.  Very few people here eat orange or lemon marmalade, and everyone  continues to call their jam by the old name.\n\nThe name is not very old, though, and it used to refer to a variety  of things in its eventful history. Meanwehile, the ancestry of what we  know as Brombeermarmelade is bound up with different terms. The earliest  cooked preserves are known simply as *Mus*, a catchall term for soft, spoonable foods, or *Latwerge*, derived from the term electuarium for a medical concoction prepared with sugar or honey to be spooned or licked up.\n\nBrambles are relatively rare in the early recipe corpus, but they do feature. The [Innsbruck MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Innsbrucker-Rezeptbuch.pdf)  mentions them [used in fruit purees](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/04/fruit-purees-from-the-innsbruck-ms/), but does not elaborate. They are also used [in fruit wines](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/05/medicinal-bramble-wine-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) and, at least by the sixteenth century, for [colouring and flavouring wines](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/14/brown-cloth-from-de-rontzier/).  The earliest recipe for preserving them cooked down I am aware of is in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf):\n\n***15 If you would make a good puree of brambles, let them  be picked as you need them. Pound them in a mortar, pass them through a  cloth, set them by the fire and let them boil. Take a good pure wheat  flour, toast (gloyge) it so that it does not taste burned (eynsmecke na brande),  put it in and let it boil. Take honey and spices. Add to that and let  it boil so that it has its (proper) thickness. That way it is good***.\n\nWe are still some wayys away from the modern thing. Thickening with  flour is not acceptable today, and we have no good informatrion on the  sweetness and consistency that is aimed for here. Quite possibly, the  final product was quite thick, like other [roughly contemporary fruit preserves](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/04/fruit-leather-from-the-oeconomia/). But we have a fairly clear line of descent from here.\n\n*Marmelade* shows up in German usage in the seventeenth  century and is quickly adopted, but it initially describes fruit juices  cooked with sugar, somet5hing we would call a *Gelee* today. The [*Brandenburgisches Koch*buch of 1723](https://digitale.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/vd18/content/titleinfo/7537989) (which is itself a pirated edition of [Die wohl-unterwiesene K\u00f6chin](https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/17730/1) by [Maria Sophia Schellhammer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sophia_Schellhammer)) describes the process cursorily, but clearly:\n\n***To Prepare Marmelade of Barberries, Currants, Mulberries and the Like***\n\n***These fruit are pressed out and the juice is cooked until  it begins to thicken. Then add as  much sugar as there is of juice and  let it cook until it is thick enough, and continue as you do with the  others. But this is not used for box marmalades (Schachtel=Marmeladen).***\n\nThis is one of 19 recipes for *Marmelade* of which almost half are for quince preparations. The *Schachtel=Marmelade* refers to a way of packaging these jellies in wooden boxes, as traditional [cotignac ](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotignac_(gel%C3%A9e_de_coing))sometimes  still is. The boxes were moistened brfore filling to ease removal, and  the content served in slices, so we  can imagine this *Marmelade* quite solid, like [*dulce de membrillo*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_membrillo), and it is possible berry juice simply did not reach that level of thickness. It is likely that the sixteenth-century [quince Latwerge I redacted for the Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook)  is already very similar, though it uses a different name.  Interestingly, this recipe orioginating in the late seventeenth century  occurs almost verbatim in the [Hamburgisches Koch=Buch](https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN796797323?tify=%7B%22pages%22%3A%5B855%5D%2C%22view%22%3A%22toc%22%7D) as late as its 1830 edition. By then, the habit of spreading *Marmelade* on cakes or bread must have required a different thickness.\n\nModern *Marmelade* owes its characteristics to the widespread  adoption of glass jars with vacuum seals. In Germany, the market leader  continues to be [Weck](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Weck), the company that introduced the technology to a wider public in 1901. The word \u2018*einwecken*\u2018  for home canning is still widely understood. The new equipment called  for instructions, and one of the many guides to the technique was Josef  L\u00f6schnig\u2019s *Das Einkochen des Obstes im B\u00fcrgerlichen Haushalt*. The 1916 edition describes making *Brombeerenmarmelade*:\n\n***The brambles produce a very fine*** **Marmelade** ***by themselves or mixed with other berries. Berries generally appear useful in mixes to make*** **Marmelade**. ***It is recommended to even use the otherwise less suitable gooseberries in the process.***\n\nThis is not much of a recipe, but the process is described in greater  detail in earlier entries: The fruit is steamed or boiled, passed  through a sieve, and cooked down with sugar. The recipe for apricots  describes it well:\n\n***The pureed fruit pulp is brought over the fire in  enamelled or earthen flat cooking vessels and stirred continually with a  spoon used solely for that purpose. In larger vessels, the stirring  should most effectively be done in the shape of the number 8. Once the  pulp is sufficiently firm, which can easily be judged in practice, the  sugar is added in poweder form or small pieces. It must be noted that  the*** **Marmelade** ***must boil up well once after the sugar has  been  added, distributed, and dissolved.  To one kilogram of fruit pulp, 60  decagrammes (600 grammes) of sugar is used. The thickening must take  place as quickly as possible over a lively fire so the result remains  bright-coloured. It is also recommended to dissolve the sugar by itself  and pour it into the fruit pulp hot. Seasoning the apricot*** **Marmelade** ***is not recommended. The finished*** **Marmelade** ***must be filled into the containers warm and they must be closed immediately.***\n\nInterestingly, the book distinguishes between *Marmelade*, made with pureed fruit pulp, and *Jam* (it  uses the English word in the German text) made with pieces of fruit. In  more modern times, fruit pieces were customary in Marmelade and it is  only lately that [pureed ](https://www.schwartau.de/Samt%20%C3%9Cbersicht)[jams ](https://www.mein-glueck.de/produkte/marmelade/passiert)have become widely available again as a marketing gimmick. Interestingly, the 1938 Das elektrische Kochen, a [recipe book advertising modern electric cooking equipment ](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/pdf/10.1484/J.FOOD.1.103556)on behalf of the Berlin utility company BEW, distinguishes *Marmelade* made from pureed fruit and *Konfit\u00fcre* which contains pieces. This is a tradition that ran long.\n\nIt is interesting that as familiarity with the sterilising process  increased, recipes become simpler. The unjustly underestimated Kochbuch  der B\u00fcchergilde by [Grete Willinsky](https://www.buechergilde.de/autorenvita/items/willinsky-grete.html) first published in 1958 states:\n\n**Brombeerkonfit\u00fcre**\n\n***2 pounds ripe brambles, 2 pounds sugar***\n\n***Bramble*** **Konfit\u00fcre** ***is prepared like raspberry*** **Konfit\u00fcre**. ***You may bulk it up by adding up to a third part of apple slices cooked alongside without adding further sugar.***\n\nThe referenced recipe for raspberries is:\n\n**Himbeerkonfit\u00fcre**\n\n***especially aromatic if made with wild raspberries***\n\n***2 pounds raspberries, 2 pounds sugar***\n\n***The carefully selected raspberries, if possible unwashed,  but carefully cleaned of all worms, are set on the stove with the sugar  and slowly brought to a boil on a low heat, regularly shaking and  tilting the pot. They are scummed and continue to boil without stirring  until the juice begins to thicken. Gel test! Fill the*** **Konfit\u00fcre** ***into warmed glass jars with a silver spoon and close them with cellophane paper the following day.***\n\nI have no doubt that this recipe works, but I prefer a higher proportion  of fruit  to sugar. As an avowed culinary modernist, my go-to product  is *Gelierzucker*, sugar with added pectin that produces a firm  jam at a ration of 2:1. That process gave me 4.5 kilogrammes of  Brombeermarmelade from 3 kilogrammes of fruit, which should last through  the summer of 2024. If I can manage to collect more, I will try out  some historical methods.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15jonhr/brombeermarmelade_a_brief_history/", "created_utc": 1691325571.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15jonhr/brombeermarmelade_a_brief_history/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Though they are  very tiny animals, easily overlooked worms and flies (*****W\u00fcrmlin und Mucken*****),  they nonetheless give great profit to humans through honey and wax  which serves for many necessity, but above all for medicine by which men  are kept in good health, the sick are strengthened and enlivened, and  their illnesses driven out. For that these small animals work a great  and amazing miracle of God by collecting and assembling such sweetness  of honey that falls to the herbs and fine-smelling flowers from heavenly  dew is clearly evident.***\n\n***Honey is of a warm and dry complexion in the second  degree. The best kind, which is most suitable for using in medicine, is  known thus: Namely that it is of strongly sweet scent, but slightly  sharp and biting in flavour, not too thick in substance, nicely golden  yellow in colour, transparent, clear and pure, and sticky and fatty to  the touch. Honey purifies well due to the abovementioned sharpness  within and without the body. It thus makes the belly go to stool and  drives out and expels the urine mightily.***\n\n***Honey is useful and good beyond all measure to elderly  people who are of cold nature. That is why Democritus the great  philosopher, when asked how humans should keep themselves and what  things they should use if they wished to live many years in peace,  replied: They should anoint the body with warming oil from the outside  and with honey from within. But to those who are of hot complexion,  honey is of no use. Rather it is harmful, for by the general rule of  physicians it is known to change into gall or sharp, choleric moisture.  Where honey if boiled by itself with no additions, it is even sharper,  purges and nourishes the body more strongly, and is also more potent for  external use to clean and fill out deep damage. Note further that  springtime honey is the best, and following it summertime honey.  Wintertime honey is least useful and most easily turned into choleric  moisture and gall inside the body, especially in people who have hot  stomachs. Honey removes all uncleanness and pollution from the body,  keeps all things fresh and guards them from destruction. That is why it  was the custom among the ancients in many places to embalm the bodies of  the deceased with it. Similarly it is customary in our day to preserve  small game of many kinds (*****mancherley Wildfang*****) fresh with  honey, and many fruit, as is described in a separate part of this book  or the Teutschen Apotecken. The Ancients also used honey, by certain  experience, against miscarriages. If you take honey after having  overindulged in wine, it will not allow it to rise up to harm the head  and brain. Honey also restores lost appetite and desire for food in  those who lost it due to an excess of phlegmatic moisture and damaging  flows. Honey cuts through viscous phlegm and causes it to be expelled.***\n\n***Also note a particular form of harm that humans encounter  from honey, namely that all dishes prepared with it become hard to  digest. Where it is not well digested, it causes a stopping of the liver  and the spleen. Those who overuse honey also give rise to mange,  lesions, and damage to the skin.***\n\n***(\u2026)***\n\n***Note here that honey must always be scummed before it is  used in any form of medicine or preservation. Do it thus: Take the honey  which you selected by the abovementioned qualities, place it in a clean  vessel, a copper pot or pan or the like, add half the quantity of water  and let it boil well together over a coal fire or bright flames of dry  wood that does not smell. Scum it continually until the water boils  away. Strain this scummed and purified honey through a white woolen  cloth and keep it for your use.***\n\n***Note that they have fine white honey in several places.  It can be used profitably in many of the following recipes as you will  find explained sufficiently there.***\n\nThere is not much to be added here. It is useful to know what the  contemporary idea of good quality honey is, though we can rightly doubt  this was always available. The purifying process is interesting, as is  the fact that it was apparently done in large quantities for storage. I  definitely look forward to finding out how Ryff envisions preserving  game and fruit in honey and hope he actually describes this where he  says he does. \n\nWalter Ryff, a somewhat enigmatic figure, was a medical professional  and incredibly prolific author in the mid-16th century. Many of his  works on areas ranging from dietetics to obstetrics to architecture were  very successful despite repeated accusations of plagiarism.

The author had already mentioned the key to unlocking the mystery of these cultural practices already - while some of these things are uniquely Japanese, roughly half of them are Italian-American culinary imports.  More specifically, USGI (Government Issue - aka American servicemembers) import/export Inc.  Tobasco on everything?  Anerican soldiers.

The whole dispiriting and  dismal story of this colonial venture is too long to recount here, so I  will limit myself to the food references. These letter, many of which  were meant for circulation, provided one of the earliest sources on the  Americas in German. A general account notes: \n\n \n\n[Philipp von Hutten \\(centre\\) mustering his troops, dogs and horses still uneaten](https://preview.redd.it/9pen1rolke9b1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcef90c5f02bba12d629deb98872db31ab7a8a83)\n\n***Neither bread nor wine grow here and there is no meat  other than deer, not many of them, and those not as large as in our  country. There are tigers and leopards and many gamebirds. \u2026  They make  bread from white grains which they call*** **Mayz** ***and  which grows on stalks in ears like grain. They cut it and sow it in its  season. It makes a good-tasting and strengthening bread which, however,  they do not salt. They also have another kind of bread which they call*** **Casumbe** ***and which is made from a root.*** \n\nThese observations are reinforced in a letter of 1535:\n\n***We have food for a year which we brought from Hispaniola, (including) flour and wine, and we can always receive*** **refresco** ***from Santo Domingo. \u2026 There is good, strengthening bread in the country made from*** **Mahiz** ***though many do not like to eat it \u2026 There is fresh water, though no wine.*** \n\nGermans always seem to have had reservations about maize as a bread  grain. There is an account of experiments made in the late sixteenth  century that was not well received, and of course more recent experience  associated maize bread firmly with the famine years after 1945 when  large amounts were imported from the United States. The absence of wine,  too, must have hit the Welsers\u2019 South German mercenaries as  hard as it  did the Spanish conquistadors. Both wine and flour were brought in, no  doubt at considerable expense. \n\nWe have reason to doubt that many of the German conquerors enjoyed  either much. According to a letter of 1535, the majority of the men  lived in poverty, in perpetual debt to their employers:\n\n***We have found over 300 Christians in this country, all  very poor, miserable and oppressed by debt. The Welser supplied them  with clothing, food and drink in this country and give them all  necessities on credit, but they cannot leave the country until they have  paid off their debt.*** \n\nSince the Welser never found any way to make agriculture or resource  extraction profitable, they relied on military expeditions find gold,  silver, rich mines, or people to subjugate. This strategy failed to pay  dividends, though the hunt for the legendary El Dorado would continue in  the region for centuries. In reality, the troops faced severe privation  away from their bases:\n\n***It is a horror to recount what vermin such as snakes, toads, lizards or iguanas (*****Laceraten*****), wormy plants and roots, and many other kinds of unnatural foods our poor Christians ate on this path and expedition.*** \n\nWe should note that the reference to poor Christians (*arme Christen*)  very likely needs to be read in purely economic terms \u2013 it was the  poor, not the rich, that had to make do with such foods. A letter of  1538 goes into slightly more detail: \n\n***No vermin nor herb or root remained uneaten on this expedition, and neither did iguanas (*****Lacertas*****),  snakes, toads, mice, and many such strange worms that it is an  abomination to speak of it. It is hard to believe how good a cook hunger  is. Also, many Christians surreptitiously and contrary to human nature  ate human flesh. Particularly, one Christian was found who had hidden in  the forest and cooked a quarter of a young child in a pot with herbs. A  dog was sold for 100 pesos, a horse that had died of disease or been  killed by the Indians for 1000 pesos for food.*** \n\nThe horror of the situation is hard to overstate. It is the small  detail of mentioning the herbs in the cookpot that make the description  credible; Many accounts of European encounters with Native Americans in  the region agree that they, unlike Europeans, [did not use culinary herbs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/01/lionel-wafer-describes-native-american-cooking/)  or salt. I cannot imagine what encountering these heavily armed,  desperately immiserated and angry cannibals felt like for the locals. \n\nThe letters from the Welser archives are published in Das Gold der  Neuen Welt.

I already posted some  of the recipes on Facebook back before I started my blog, so some of  you may remember them. Today, something simple to start with:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5s8d4aqxcm8b1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa5044f03281b7565b9fb9a302093c1120f25cf1\n\n***Recipe #65*** **f\u00fclle den magen als*****o***\n\n***Fill the stomach thus***\n\n***Item take chopped pork, eggs, cut white bread, fat meat,  pepper, caraway, saffron and salt and temper it all together. Full the  stomach with it not too full and boil it green (raw?). When it is  boiled, loosen the filling from the stomach. Cut it into four pieces and  chop it with eggs (the pronoun here suggests it is the stomach, not the  filling, that gets chopped)***\n\nThere are a few issues with the interpretation, but basically the  recipe calls for filling the stomach of a poig with a mixture of chopped  pork, bread, eggs, fat, and spices which is then boiled into a solid  mass. I did try this at one point and it was pleasant enough, though  nothing special. Considering the amount of labour that went into making  this in an age before mechanical meat grinders, I would have expected  more. \n\nOne of the most extensive and interesting medieval recipe collections  in German is a manuscript dated 1460 and ascribed to one Meister Hans,  cook at the Wurttemberg court. It was often treated as a solitary, the  work of a single cook, but there are too many parallels with  contemporary manuscripts from Southern Germany to make this plausible.  The recipes are an eclectic mix, many terse and simple, others detailed  and sprinkled with anecdotes.

Pound it  together and pass it through with wine, spice it and salt it gently,  thus the sauce will be white. White sauce with garlic is passed through  with semel bread and not salted, and you use a little meat broth into it  to thin it etc.***\n\n***118 If you would make a green sauce of garlic, take the  green (of the garlic?) and parsley and chop it together. Pound it and  pass it through a cloth with*** **semel** ***bread and with wine or vinegar to the thickness of a pfeffer sauce etc.***\n\n***119 If you would prepare a sauce of horseradish (*****chren*****), take horseradish and scrape it nicely along the root. Cut it into cubes and pound them. Add*** **semel** ***bread and pass it through with meat broth etc.***\n\n***120 If you wish, also make a green sauce from the*** **kraut** ***(the greens of the horseradish?), this is also good ground with wine, or also pound it and pass it through etc.***\n\nThe underlying principle of these sauces is standard: the ingredients  are ground to a paste and passed through a cloth or sieve together. In  some cases, white semel bread is used as a binding agent. It is unclear  whether these sauces are meant to be cooked or left raw. I suspect the  latter, but many recipes never mention what their authors consider  obvious. \n\nWhat makes them stand out is their attractive simplicity. They depart  from the medieval sterotype; there is no saffron, no heavy use of  spices. Instead, we have bread-thickened white sauces based on garlic or  horseradish with very little to get in the way of the essential  flavour. Modern horseradish sauce tends to cut the bite with cream  instead, but this would not be out of place on a modern South German  table. Neither would an [alternative sauce thickened with nuts](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/29/horseradish-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/)  mentioned in a different source. Then there are the green sauces that  (I think) rely on the shoots of garlic and horseradish to produce a  tangy green sauce with less of a bite and more refreshing qualities. The  garlic sauce if made to the thickness of a *pfeffer*, so it  would look a lot like a pesto, though of course it includes neither nuts  nor cheese. These all look like excellent accompaniments to a serving  of roast or boiled meat. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

{"title": "The Ancestry of Kuttelfleck (1450-1858)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/09/the-ancestry-of-kuttelfleck/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/09/the-ancestry-of-kuttelfleck/)\n\n Another short recipe from the Innsbruck MS: \n\n ***104 If you would fry tripe (*****wammppenflekh*****), boil them very well and prepare a strauben batter, dredge them in it and fry them. But you may also first fry (*****rosten*****) them in fat if you wish, and salt them etc.***\n\nThis is an interesting recipe, firstly because it linguistically ties a medieval dish to a thoroughly modern practice. The word *wammppenflekh* clearly relates to what we call *Kuttelfleck* today. The word *wammppen* \u2013 *Wampe* in  modern German \u2013 refers to the belly in general and in culinary terms to  the stomachs of cattle. Fleck at this point can refer to a piece or  patch which suggests the stomach was cut into small squares. That is  what Kuttelfleck is to this day, to the extent that it still is made.  Like most offal dishes, it has lost popularity. \n\nThe recipe suggests that there are different ways of preparing the  dish. The first approach seems to be to parboil the sliced tripe, then  batter  and deep-fry it. As an aside, this recipe also illustrates the  difference in culinary vocabulary: The word used to describe  shallow-frying in a pan is *r\u00f6sten*, and this is also used to  describe cooking something in a small amount of liquid or over coals.   Today, it usually means grilling or toasting over direct heat.  Deep-frying, on the other hand, is called *backen*, the same word  that also describes baking things in ovens or closed containers. I  suspect that there is something conceptual going on here I am not fully  on to yet.\n\nNow, the dish clearly has a long tradition, and we can find what it  looks like in classical modernity from Katharina Prato\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche  K\u00fcche first published in 1858 (here from the 1912 printing of the 1896  revised edition):\n\n***Kuttelflecke or Kaldaunen.***\n\n***(\u2026)***\n\n***Fried (*****Gebacken*****). You leave the boiled pieces (*****Flecke*****)  to cool, cut them into squares, turn them over in egg and breadcrumbs,  and fry them in fat. They can be served as  a topping to vegetable  dishes or as a separate dish. In the latter case, they can be boiled up  before serving with lemon juice or with meat jus.***   \n\nAs they liked to title every  other book when I was in university: Continuity and Change in Tripe. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

Recipes from the Innsbruck MS: \n\n \n\n[Stars and dagging](https://preview.redd.it/93z33kx40g4b1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9523b97bdf89f37765b76adc2d8adb622c317ced)\n\n***112 If you would make fried stars, prepare dough sheets as for*** **hasen orlein** ***and  cut stars from them. Always put two on top of each other and fill them.  That is also good. Fry them like other fritters, but these are better  etc.***\n\nThis recipe is nice and short, but it takes a lot of interpretation. First, what are *hasen orlein*?  The word means hare\u2019s ears, and they are a kind of fritter that was  quite basic. I read it as a dough of flour, egg, and milk for this  occasion, based not least on the way people made [\u2018infidel cakes\u2019,](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/01/a-standard-fritter-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)  but I suppose it could have been as simple as flour and water. The star  shapes were made with a cookie cutter, but could just as easily be  produced with a knife. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Raisin-fig filling](https://preview.redd.it/w7zadc070g4b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c334947349978d2ce4e218350dc8c55444faf670)\n\n For the filling, I decided to go with raisins and figs simmered in wine.  To get this to work, you need to use liquid sparingly and add to the  mix as it is absorbed until all the fruit are soft and can be mashed.  Fillings of this kind are mentioned frequently and I rather like their  intense sweetness without any added sugar and way they take strong  spicing (in this case nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and cardamom). One  small  teaspoonful on each star was quite enough, which meant in the end we  had a lot left over.  \n\n \n\n[Ready for the pan](https://preview.redd.it/2xqhrwta0g4b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be610b4ff911040c8675c7fb6811a31998db5b3f)\n\nI stuck the edges together by moistening them, but egg wash is  equally possible and would probably make the result prettier. Then I  fried them in oil at a fairly low temperature. It works well, the stars  hold together much better than mere crimped edges, but they need to be  turned frequently to get them to brown evenly. \n\nThen, since I had dough left, I went for another recipe:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cut dagging](https://preview.redd.it/3s4q70hd0g4b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6b1a46d1ffe6bcf333a629b70b137d1e0fb8083)\n\n***109 If you would prepare a fritter that looks like cut dagging (*****gesniten fronsen*****),  also make sheets of dough and cut them and roll them out on top of each  other. Fry them in fat that is not too hot and press them together at  the top before you put them into the fat etc.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Frying](https://preview.redd.it/qk8o5e8g0g4b1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43dbf311e31d0b9b922d5a1915cbb7928ad22aed)\n\nHere, I simply rolled out and cut a long, rectangular strip of dough,  cut dagging into it (in this case just a simple fringe, though I guess  more artiostioc designs are possible), folded them over and pressed  together the solid edge. The dough was sticky and I did not have high  hopes, but the fringe actually separated and opened out very  attractively. We  broke off individual pieces to dip them in our [*cibus maiis*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/15/biscotti-and-may-dish-for-a-vigil/).  \n\n Altogether, this was a good result and I will use both recipes again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/142pgbk/fried_stars_and_dagging_c_1450/", "created_utc": 1686076963.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/142pgbk/fried_stars_and_dagging_c_1450/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Grate gingerbread (*****lezelten*****) or bread into it. Take the toasted (*****verpr\u00fcnnen*****) bread and pound it very small and also add it, that way it becomes black. And take onions cut small and fry them (*****swais ab*****) in fat or oil. Add them, and honey, and season it and take hard bread like (as though for?) a hare\u2019s head (*****hasen kopf*****) and add that, and do not oversalt it etc.***\n\n***97 If you wish, you can make a chessboard of it. Only  take of coloured pounded peas and put them in a bowl. You know how to  divide them, and if you wish, press a particular coloured item (*****ein besunder gefert*****) on every part (i.e. field of the chessboard) with a mould.***\n\nThese recipes, too, are quite interesting. Recipe #93 seems to be for peas in aspic, and we have a parallel for this in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf)  (recipe #37). Here, the peas are prepared with honey and flour and  shaped into fish. The recipe here clearly refers to an aspic, as it very  likely does in the Innsbruck MS. Using the same material as a filling  for [rolled-up dough sheets](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/24/egg-filled-fritters/)  seems an odd idea, but #94 states it was done. It does suggest that the  peas were strongly spiced, otherwise they would not complement the  relatively bland dough well.\n\nRecipe #95 is a riff on the roasted peas we find in [so ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/14/roasted-peas-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/)[many ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/11/failed-roast-peas-from-meister-hans/)of [our ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/11/roast-pease-pudding-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)[sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/08/another-roast-peas-recipe-from-meister-eberhard/), but here it is turned into a [Hohlbraten](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/18/a-filled-meat-loaf-roast/), a [hollow roast](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/30/roasted-meat-loaf-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)  that could be filled with all manner of goodies. This cannot have been  easy to pull off, but must have impressed diners considerably. \n\nRecipe #96 is somewhat unclear. A *f\u00fcrhess* is normally a dish of meat or, [more rarely, fish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/13/sauce-for-carp-from-munich-cgm-349/) that is thickened with blood. Here, dark toast and two types of gingerbread (*lezelten* and *pfeffer brot*)  are added to cooked peas. We cannot reconstruct the distinction between  the two, but there must have been one. Fried onions and honey, both  commonly used in [actual ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/25/two-furhess-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/)[*f\u00fcrhess* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/01/venison-blood-and-kidney-stew-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)[recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/01/18/blood-sauce-for-venison-from-ggm-349/), are also added. I suppose the idea is to produce a thick sauce similar in colour to cooked blood. \n\nThe final recipe #97 is also interesting. Mashed peas \u2013 presumably  stiffened in some way to make them hold together better \u2013 are shaped  into a chessboard decorated with moulded shapes in a  different colour.  Chessboards show up[ in other  culinary media](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/24/chequered-jelly-from-the-konigsberg-ms/),  too. This recipe is a reminder to us that a lot of complex  and  visually impressive work was done in more humble media than the marzipan  and sugarpaste we usually asscoiate with medieval subtelties. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

Then take eggs and boil them hard, chop  them, and prepare them as if you wanted to make halved eggs. Season it  and also add honey, and spread this on the sheets. Then prepare a*** **strauben** ***batter and roll them in it, and fry them. Cut them into slices and serve them dry or serve a*** **ziseindel** ***sauce over them.***\n\n Again, we find our \u2018sheets\u2019, and here they are clearly of a stiff  dough that can be rolled out thin. Pasta dough or even phyllo works,  though I prefer using a slightly thicker, leavened dough in most cases.  The \u2018halved eggs\u2019 referenced here occur earlier in the collection:\n\n***54 If you would make halved eggs, boil the eggs hard,  shell them, cut them apart and remove the yolks. Chop them and add  parsley and season it and salt it, and mix it with another (raw) egg.  Fill it back into the white, fry them in fat, and (serve) a pepper sauce  (*****pfefferlein*****) or a*** **ziseindel** ***sauce over it, or serve them in a yellow sauce (*****pr\u00fclein*****) and salt them, or serve them fried in strauben batter.***\n\nSo we have cooked egg mixed with spices and parsley and slightly  sweetened with honey rolled up in a thin sheet of dough that is then  dipped in batter to seal it and fried. The principle was quite  common,  and I actually tried a fairly similar recipe from the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf) a while ago: \n\n***90 Item monks\u2019 eggs (*****monnikeseigere*****). Take eggs,  scramble them and make a sheet (of dough). And put the scrambled eggs  into the sheet. And wrap it all around. Take eggs and close (brush) it  all around. And fry it in butter or animal fat.***\n\nThat was pretty good, though I suspect actually dipping the rolls in a  thick batter would make them hold together better than brushing them  with egg  did. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

I appear to have caught a  rather unpleasant virus. For today, here is an interesting recipe from  the Innsbruck MS:\n\n***74 If you would make a filled chicken, remove its skin so that it stays whole. Take roastable (pratigs)  venison and bacon with it and chop it small while it is raw. Add spices  and return it to the skin. Put it into a pot and let it boil, and then  serve it in a good sauce (prulein) or dry it on a griddle etc.***\n\n[ Chicken minus skin \u2013 this is easier than it looks if  you are willing to leave in the wings and legbones. ](https://preview.redd.it/qhvdwgu1a81b1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f233fc332ce82be6ea94030df84b330fc28d463)\n\nThis may strike us as strange, but it was definitely not an unusual idea. I found (and tried) a similar recipe in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf) a few years ago:\n\n***30 Item if you would make roasted chickens without bones,  scald them well to measure and make (pluck) them clean. Clear them out  (loosen the skin?) all around before you take them out. Cut them open a  little above the wings or higher (?ofte up***). ***Take out the insides ( ingheweide*** \u2013  ***usually entrails) altogether there so that the skin stays undamaged.  Then take the meat and the liver and the stomach and cook them until  done. Take out the bones and chop it finely (*** **thohope wol thomate  clene** ***lit:  a lot and small in its proper measure). Add eggs and spices and bacon  and raisins. Fill it back into the skin. Parboil it in water so that it  hardens. Make as many of these chickens, as you  need. You may boil or  roast them. When they are done, serve them***.\n\n[ Boneless chicken, sliced open. Admittedly it looks more like roast bullfrog, but it was a first attempt.  ](https://preview.redd.it/vpwwt9o7a81b1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e20ee2d01ec0495a595193e2a4f1ce9c3969c818)\n\nFirst of all, this recipe tells us the idea was more general than a  single recipe. Here, the meat is filled out with bacon and egg and the  entrails are parboiled separately while the Innsbruck MS adds venison  and the whole is cooked in the skin only (which no doubt required a  great deal of skill and attention). Secondly, there is a bit more  guidance in technical aspects. Unfortunately, the text is less than  clear, but I suspect the intent of the possibly garbled sentence is to  cut off the wing joints. Getting the wings out of the skin may well be  impossible and is certainly more difficult than I would attempt. Much of  the rest of the skin is surprisingly easy to loosen and remove.\n\nIt is rather difficult to have these chicken skins keep their shape  (though that may be different if they are not delivered with the entire  stomach cavity opened up, as modern chickens bought at market invariably  are). I can only imagine that serving them whole and slicing them like a  sausage must have made an impression on guests. That at least seems to  be the intended effect in a boneless chicken, as the  Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch calls it.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context.

This one really makes no practical sense at all. \n\n ***57 If you would make rice out of eggs, boil the eggs hard and then take the hard egg (*****daz hert*****)  and chop it very small.

Many surviving recipes  for illusion food are intended for Lent, a way of simulating meat, dairy  and eggs on days when they were prohibited. Others are complex and  playful, cooking chickens in jars or preparing large fish to appear  cooked in different ways along their body. This is just mashed and  cooked eggs to mimic rice cooked to a mush. This, incidentally, was how  Europeans prepared rice at the time. Cooking it to keep the grains  separate, as [was the custom in the Ottoman Empire](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/29/turkish-recipes-in-rumpolt-1581/),  was uncommon and worthy of note. Rice, of course, was never prohibited,  and though dairy was on certain days, this dish does not substitute the  milk.

{"title": "Limburger Cheese", "selftext": "I have taken the opportunity to catalogue my cookbooks on the EatYourBooks website. All the while, occasionally opening those I forgot I owned, I have stumbled on this brilliant MASTERPIECE from 1904's \"The Culinary Handbook - The Most Complete and Serviceable Reference Book to Things Culinary Ever Published\" by Charles Fellows (published by The Hotel Monthly). I started to photograph it, but it is a bit too long and the font awfully small, so I have transcribed it for your benefit:\n\n\"CHEESE - A most nutritious food, forming many excellent dishes; it is of various kinds, of which the following are to be found in good hotels: Skim, cream, full cream : cheddar, stilton, mesan, edam, gorgonzola, gruyere, port-du-salut, sage, sap-sago, and sometimes on the bar and in German clubs may be found Limburger, to describe which the following story will aid without further comment:\n\n     LIMBURGER CHEESE - Ma sent me to pay a bill at the grocers last Saturday. The boss behind the counter made me a present of something wrapped in a piece of silver paper, which he told me was a piece of Limburger cheese. When I got outside the shop I opened the paper, and when I smelt what was inside I felt tired. I took it home and put it in the coal shed. In the morning I went to it again. It was still there. Nobody had taken it. I wondered what I could do with it. \n\nFather and mother were getting ready to go to church. I put a piece in the back pocket of father's pants, and another piece in the lining of ma's muff. I walked behind when we started for church. It was beginning to get warm. When we got in church, father looked anxious and mother looked as if something had happened. After the first hymn, mother told father not to sing again, but to keep his mouth shut and breathe through his nose. After the prayer, perspiration stood on father's face, and the people in the next pew to ours got up and went out.  After the next hymn father whispered to mother that he thought she had better go out and air herself. After the second lesson, some of the church wardens came round to see if there were any stray rats in the church. Some more people near our pew got and went out, putting their handkerchiefs to their noses as they went out. The parson said they had better close the service, and hold a meeting outside to discuss the sanitary condition of the church. Father told mother they had better go home one at a time. Mother told father to the nearest way home and disinfect himself before she came.\n\nWhen they got home, they both went into the front room, but did not speak for some time. Mother spoke first, and told father to put the cat out of the room, as she thought it was going to be sick. It was sick and noticed that the canary was dead. Mother told father not to sit so near to the fire, as it made matters worse. Father told mother to go and smother herself. Mother said she thought she was smothered already. Just then the servant came in and asked if she should open the windows, as the room felt very close. Father went upstairs and changed his clothes, and had a hot bath. \n\nMother took father's clothes and offered them to a tramp, who said, \"Thanks, kind lady, they are bit too high for me.\" Mother threw them over the back fence into the canal. Father was summoned afterwards for poisoning the fish. Mother went to bed. Father asked her if she had been fumigated. Just then father had a note sent him. Father came to wish me \"Good Night\" at 10 o'clock in the evening, with the note in one hand and a razor strop in the other. I got under the bed. The people next door thought we were beating carpets in the house. I cannot sit down comfortably yet. \n\nI have given my little sister what I had left of that Limburger cheese.

I believe Avicenna called this plant*** **piper caninum**, ***which name it also had when it was first brought into our country. The other Arabs called it*** ***Cordumenum***. ***Accordingly this pepper is a kind (Geschlecht) of the fruit that in our apothecaries\u2019 shops is called Grana Paradisii. I believe  that Actuarius named this plant Capsicum on account of its seed being shut up in the pods orderly like in a box or chest.

The  first produces large, long pods that are black-brown in  colour. The  second kind has  pods that equal the first in size, but are red as  miunium (menigrot). The third  produces narrower leaves than the others and its pods are also  narrower, longer, and red as  minium. The fourth kind has large, round  pods. Some are shaped like pointy hats, others like common pumpkins, but  red as minium in colour, as we will clearly indicate describing its  appearance.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wnf3b7sf8ga1.jpg?width=1085&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d8bd3e0a021084e7dbaaa08b6601a07eda3bcc1\n\n***Appearance: Indian pepper is a herb with a brown,  rectangular stem which is an ell in length, with manyy twists and round  branches that are covered in blackish-green, tender leaves. They  resemble those of the nightshade or the laurel, but are narrower and  pointier than those of the nightshade. Between the wings of the branches  and leaves on the thick stems, the flowers grow out that are white in  colour and commonly have five or six petals and a green star within.  Once they drop off, the pods follow them, a finger\u2019s length on the first  and second kind, longer and narrower on the third, and round and broad  on the fourth. The pods are first green, then entirely red, but  black-brown on the second kind. And on the first two kinds, which we  show together in one illustration, the ripe pod looks like a crawfish  claw. The outer skin is shiny with smoothness and is  very tender and  thin. The fruit or pods enclose many pale yellpow, flat seeds that are  of a hot and sharp flavour like pepper, indeed even sharper. The roots  are woody and fibrous.***\n\n***Place of Cultivation: Indian pepper is a  foreign plant  recently bought to our German land. It is grown in containers and herb  gardens. It will not suffer frost and must be regrown or kept in heated  rooms (der Stuben) over the winter. Thus it bears  fruit again, as it did for me.***\n\n***Season: Flowers in June and July and bears fruit in autumn.***\n\n***Its Nature and Complexion: Indian pepper is very warming  and drying, as can be seen from the leaves that are bitter in taste and  afterwards from the seed that is so very sharp on the tongue.***\n\n***Its Use and Effect: In many places, the seed of this  plant is used in place of pepper because it has the same effect. It  warms, separates, and consumes, strengthens the cold stomach and aids   digestion. It  drives out the wind. It draws resilient moisture from the  head if it is chewed with mint (Bi\u00dfm\u00fcntzen).  It is good for the teeth  and gums as it consumes all harmful moisture in them and guards against  rot. Thus it makes the mouth smell good. It consumes the goitre and  other growths if mixed with pitch and applied in a plaster. Ground with  honey and spread on the skin, it makes the face beautiful and removes  the blemishes on the same. In sum, it has  almost all effects and  virtues as true pepper.***\n\nNeedless to point out that much of this is complete nonsense. *Capsicum annuum*,  chili pepper, is a New World plant that none of the classical  authorities could have described (Fuchs most likely confuses it with  long pepper, *piper longum*). However, both the  description and  the illustrations make the identification unequivocal. We should caution  that while Fuchs writes it is used like pepper \u2018in many places\u2019, we  have no documentary evidence that any of these places were in Germany.  Generally, chilis, like many other New World cultivars, were more  readily adopted outside of Western Europe. The association with Calicut  (which, unlike the ambiguous word *Indianisch*, clearly refers to  South Asia) may be legitimately true at this point. Later German  writers also know  chilis as  \u2018Turkish pepper\u2019 due to its widespread use  in the Ottoman Empire.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10tqjzn/chilis_in_1543_germany/", "created_utc": 1675542908.0, "score": 4, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/10tqjzn/chilis_in_1543_germany/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

I cannot get copyright-free images of Rumpolt at the moment. ](https://preview.redd.it/0t36ly13dvaa1.jpg?width=4396&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff0fe9c1b7e7420683cc7ed3f3b001e176f3421c)\n\n***Of a turkey (Indianischen Henn), twenty dishes may be prepared:***\n\n***1 Roasted warm with  as*** **pobrat** ***sauce or served dry (without sauce) or allowed to cool. for it is good food when it is cold.***\n\n***2 Pastries, warm or cold***\n\n***3 Dismember the turkey, take wings and legs and fill each  one separately. When it is filled, set it to cook and let them boil  until done. Lay them on a griddle and brown them, and prepare a sauce  for them, it be sour or sweet, it ios good in both ways.***\n\n***4 You can also stew (eynmachen)  these filled wings with parsley root, good mace and beef broth and with   green fragrant herbs. You may make it yellow (with saffron) or leave  it white, it is good both ways.***\n\n***5 You can also cook such filled wings and legs in a pepper sauce.***\n\n***6 Or you can stew it in green sauce with parsley that is  boiled well and passed through, with a toasted slice of white bread and  beef broth with parsley and liver. Season it with saffron and pepper,  and see you do not overseason or oversalt it. Thus it is good and  well-tasting.***\n\n***7 Take half a breast that is raw and make meatballs of it, be they white or yellow.***\n\n***8 Make a pounded dish (ein gestossens) from the  other half breast that is boiled. You can leave it white or make it  green with green parsley that was boiled and passed through with good  chicken broth and also with toasted bread slices, thus it is good and  well-tasting.***\n\n***9 You can also make a good chopped dish (geheck)  of it. If it is white, take clear chicken broth, but if it is roasted,  take a brown broth that you have drawn from a roast together with  chicken broth that is salted very mildly. When you  wish to serve it at  the table, squeeze the juice of  bitter oranges on it, thus it becomes   good and delicate.***\n\n***10 You can also serve meatballs in pastries.***\n\n***11 You can also make small pastries from the breast.***\n\n***12 Or Spanish pastries.***\n\n***13 Or Spanish fritters (Krapffen)***\n\n***14 You can also make*** **Manscho Blancko** ***(blanc manger) from the breast as is described earlier.***\n\n***15 You can make a Hungarian tart from the*** **Manscho Blancko**\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\*\n\n***16 Or a Spanish tart.***\n\n***17 Also a Spanish pastry.***\n\n***18 Fritters (Krapffen) to fry: Take flour, warm  water, and a little butter  and salt, mix the flour with that and make a  dough with it that is not too thick, so you roll it out with a  rolling  pin (walger). Wrap the*** **Manscho Blancko** ***in this and make*** **Krapffen** ***of  it. Take hot butter and fry them nicely cool (at a low temperature) so  that they stay white and not turn brown. Thus the  dough turns out crisp  and good. When you serve them, strew them with white sugar.***\n\n***19 Also make a*** **Mu\u00df** ***(spoon dish) from the*** **Manscho Blancko**. ***Take the*** **Manscho Blancko** ***and mix it with eggs and with sweet milk. Take a bowl and grease it with cold butter at the bottom. Then place the*** **Mu\u00df** ***in  the bowl, push it into the oven and bake it. Thus it will rise up  nicely. When you serve it, strew it with sugar, that way it will be  good.***\n\n***20 You can also prepare clear broth from the turkey and  cook more than forty dishes that are not of little account (i.e. main  dishes). You can use the stomach, liver, guts, and blood. And  you must   not discard any of it because you can make use of everything.***\n\nAs we saw in the [last post on guinea pigs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/06/guinea-pig-recipes-from-marx-rumpolt/),  New World animals were readily accepted into the European kitchen.  Turkeys  are  mentioned in the mid-16th century in German sources as a  novelty, and by 1581, Marx Rumpolt already offers this lengthy list of  using them. The idea of  filling wings and legs stands out, and I think  what is meant here is adding a [seasoned meat paste between the skin and the flesh](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/06/seasoning-a-goose-under-the-skin/), a common practice in the medieval kitchen. The *Manscho Blancko*  referred to repeatedly is blanc manger, a spoonable dish of meat  (usually chicken), rice flour, and almond milk. It is the origin of  modern blancmage, but by the sixteenth century this once fashionable  preparation had become old hat and relegated to the function of an  ingredient. Other than that, all the preparations given here are things  that cooks would also do with chickens or other poultry. Especially the  final entry can basically be read to mean that the turkey should be  treated like a chicken, a bird thoroughly familiar to frugal cooks  for  all its potential uses.\n\nI apologise for yesterday\u2019s hiatus and must also beg your indulgence  for several more in the coming two or three weeks. I have followed a few  leads in eleventh-century sources that may in time result in posts  about cannibalism in European warfare (that was very much a thing) and,  for a broad definition of \u2018eating\u2019, the darkly-hinted, shocking practice  of cunnilingus. Or not, depending on whether my research pans out.\n\nThank you for your patience and appreciation.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/106rj2g/turkey_recipes_from_1581/", "created_utc": 1673205403.0, "score": 5, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/106rj2g/turkey_recipes_from_1581/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Blanch the almonds and pound them as small as possible, pour  rosewater on them, and when they are pounded very finely, add sugar,  thus they will become finer still. When it is well mingled together like  a thick dough, you must spread it out (ausstreichen). Watch  out that you do not add too much rosewater. You can always make it  thinner with rosewater. Take it out of a mortar into a bowl, add a  little mace and rub it between your hands. Then take a wafer (blat, read*** **oblat**)  ***and cut it like the lozenges of windowpanes. You may make it large or  small. Then take of the same wafer thus cut and spread the almond on it  as thinly as possible, the thinner the nicer. Then take the white of an  egg, two or three spoonfuls, add some fragrant rosewater and beat it  well with a spoon until it develops a foam. Take the beaten (egg white)  and spread it on the almond-covered wafers. Detach them (*****schneyd es ab*****),  place it on the oven, heat it well and bake it gently. They often  attach to each other, but they are supposed to stay white. When they  bend upwards where you spread the rosewater, they become nicely hard and  prettily white. Thus they should be baked.***\n\nAnother recipe for *k\u00fcchlein*, but this one is not deep-fried.  This is a reminder that a lot of the cooking vocabulary on Early Modern  German is counterintuitive to us. *K\u00fcchlein* does not refer to a  mode of preparation, but to a shape and size, and a culinary role.  These are interesting, rich, and very delicate, and they do not quite  fit into any one slot of traditional preparations. [Baked ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/03/baked-marcipan-from-balthasar-staindl/)[marzipan ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/16/marzipans-and-date-balls-for-a-vigil/)is  spread on wafers, covered with egg white glaze, and baked, and clearly  these are related. The filling, though, is not proper marzipan. Marzipan  recipes tend to involve [more almonds than sugar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/06/marzipan-proper-and-stretched/),  at best 50-50, whereas here, we have twice as much sugar as almonds.  Also, the shape is off. Lozenge-shaped wafers are typically used with  fritters where a filling is placed between two wafers and the whole is  battered. I wonder whether this is an incidence of deliberately playing  with expectations.\n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.  Despite its brevity, it is interesting especially as it contains many  recipes for *k\u00fcchlein*, baked or deep-fried confections, that  apparently played a significant role in displaying status.

Also take figs and cut them small, and*** **Rosin**, ***take out their pips, and*** **weinberlin**. ***Put all of this into the*** **Mayenkraut**, ***break eggs into it, and make it neither too thin nor too thick. Take a flat cooking vessel (*****scherblein*****) and set it on the coals. Make a bottom crust (*****platz*****) that is as wide as the cooking vessel (*****scherb oder tigel*****) in which you wish to cook it, just like you prepare a carnival cake (*****Fa\u00dfnacht platz*****). Roll out a*** **platz,** ***put May butter into the cooking vessel (*****tigel oder scherben*****), and when it has melted, place the*** **platz** ***in it so it reaches beyond the vessel (*****dz uber das tiglein au\u00dfreich** ***i.e. is wider than just the bottom). Also put in the mass (*****teig*****) with the*** **Mayenkraut*****. Stick in*** **mayen** ***(sprigs of the herb?) and prepare it with the*** **platz** ***like a*** **fladen**. ***Do not add much May butter. Place the*** **scherblein** ***over  it (like a lid) and lay coals on top. Do not make much fire underneath,  otherwise it will readily burn. See that the bottom is thin like a*** **Fladen**, ***then it is a good*** **Mayenkuchen**.\n\nThis recipe is what happens when you try to explain something by  referring to something else as an example, but the target audience has a  limited idea what you are talking about. The author is trying to be  helpful, but we simply don\u2019t know what made a *Fa\u00dfnacht platz* specific. Similarly, there must be a clear idea what *Mayenkraut* is,  but unfortunately the word can refer to a variety of culinary herbs.  Woodruff is tempting, but unfortunately its popularity seems to be [strictly a modern phenomenon](https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/it-tastes-green/).\n\nComparison with other recipes allows us a rough reconstruction of  what is aimed for here. The technique of cooking pastries in a greased  pan heated above and below is described in the [*kuchenmaistrey*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/27/crawfish-pastries-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/).  There are also a number of recipes for May cake all of which involve  eggs and herbs. What is aimed for in most sixteenth-century versions is a  strong herbal flavour in a mass of cooked egg, coloured green with  fresh herbs. I tried the [version from Sabina Welser](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/06/an-easter-feast-in-2021-part-i/) two years ago, and this seems to be a more basic version of the same principle.\n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

A *semmel*, basically a small breadroll  similar to a manchet loaf, could be bought any day and while the kind of  birds small enough to fit one might not have been available at all  times, they were hunted year round. I am also fairly sure that other  meats would go into similar preparations.

It is part of the German  tradition of cooking fruit with grated bread to create spoonable purees,  and in this case is used as one of the fruit-based sauces that  Montaigne would later remark on. \n\nTwo interesting points that we encounter here bear mentioning. the first is the word *peitzeln*. It is related to *bei\u00dfen* and *beizen*, and still exists in South German dialects as *bitzeln*. Today, it is associated with the sensation of carbonated drinks (as in the lemonade brand [Bizzl](https://bizzl.de/)),  but here it describes a tingling or burning sensation in the mouth  produced by spices. That gives us some basic guidance in seasoning. Very  likely, the quantities were generous by modern standards. Trisanet is a  common spice mix at the time, and the recipe from Cod Pal Germ 551 can  be found in [an earlier post](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/). \n\nThe second interesting point is the use of rosewater to scent a dish,  kept covered until it is served for maximal impact at the table. This  is described several times in this recipe collection, and it adds  another dimension to the dining experience. Of course it also privileged  the people at the head of the table who would have the scent waft over  them as the dish was presented. Anyone they shared with further down the  table would barely catch a whiff. \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs aund Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.

The defining ingredient of all such May dishes  is butter, which would not be permitted in Lent under strict rules.  Compare it with the original in the same source. Secondly, the  description of this as a \u2018May dish\u2019 seems to be the one aspect that sets  it apart from the \u2018[hedgehog milk](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/21/rice-recipes-from-the-kuenstlichs-und-fuertrefflichs-kochbuch/)\u2018  that follows it closely.

{"title": "Sixteenth-Century Cherry Wine Recipe", "selftext": " [https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/16/cherry-wine-from-the-oeconomia/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/16/cherry-wine-from-the-oeconomia/)\n\nAn interesting recipe for fortified cherry wine from Johannes Coler\u2019s Oeconomia.  \n\n ***Of Cherry Wine***\n\n***(marginalia: To make cherry wine)***\n\n***Pull the cherries off the stalks and discard the stalks.  Then remove the stones from the cherries and grind them up separately  (for if you grind the stones with the cherries, they splash away too  much juice). Put them back with the flesh of the cherries and place both  of them into a long, small white cloth sack, and add anise. Suspend it  in red wine and the wine will draw to itself all the virtue of the  cherries and the stones. They must be ground in a stone vessel, not in  the (regular i.e. metal) mortar or a copper dish otherwise it tastes too  much of copper. Item, add sugarcoated anise into it, or plain anise and  cinnamon bark, thus it will be all the better. Sugar and sugar coated  anise makes it sweet.***\n\n***(marginalia: to make cherry beer)***\n\n***You also make cherry beer this way. First, you insert the  cloth bag through the bunghole, then you pour the cherries into the  bag.***\n\n***(marginalia: to make cherry wine: how to remedy it)***\n\n***But if you become aware that this wine loses its strength (*****matt wird*****),  as commonly happens in summer, prepare the cherry wine thus: First, lay  down a layer of aspen chips or other woodchips, then one of cherries,  and so forth, one after the other until the cask is full. Then fill in  the wine, and in three or four days it is good and clear enough.***\n\n***(marginalia: cherry wine, a useful drink in summer)***\n\n***Cherry wine is a good and useful drink in summer because  it quenches thirst in great heat and pleasantly moistens the overheated  internal members, and if there are ground stones in it, it opens the  liver, drives out urine, and moves the stone to exit the body.***\n\n***Many people also make it thus: They take the juice of cherries and a*** **stuebichen** ***(measure of capacity \u2013 ca. 3 litres) of honey with it, item a*** **Loth** ***(measure of weight \u2013 likely about 15 grammes)*** ***of cloves, two*** **Loth** ***of galingale, and one*** **Loth** ***of  cinnamon bark, grind it all up small and suspend it in the cherry wine.  Or they take the honey, melt it well in a cauldron, and then cool it  well again, then add it to the wine in the cask. Thus it turns out good.***\n\nThis is not as single recipe, but a variety of ways of approaching a  known goal that we, unfortunately, only partly understand. With the  addition of cherry juice and sugar or honey, I suspect some secondary  fermentation took place to produce something that was both sweet and  aromatic as well as highly alcoholic. The ground cherry pits, something  we frequently read of being added to food at the time, added flavour,  but also very likely a high concentration of cyanide-producing [amygdalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin). \n\nInterestingly, we find a recipe that seems broadly related in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf): \n\n***47 Item if you would know how to make the good cherry  drink that is carried in a bottle, take many  cherries when they are  ripe and break and grind them up well all raw. And let them stand over  night. Take off the thin part of them (the juice) and put it into a  cookpot. Set that by the fire. Let it boil. Add sugar, ginger and  cloves. Let it cool. Then store it in many bladders. Hang them in an  airy place during the day so that it dries. And when you need it because  you wish to make cherry drink, take wine or mead a*** **stoyveken** ***(measure  of capacity \u2013 often around 3-4 litres) and lay into that as large (a  piece) as a walnut of that (the cherry mix). Let it stand half the  night. If you would have it better, add more sugar and some ginger. That  way it is a good cherry drink.***\n\nThis is not easy to interpret, but it seems to be aiming for the same basic outcome \u2013 spiced, cherry-infused alcoholic drinks. \n\nJohann Coler\u2019s *Oeconomia ruralis et domestica* was a popular  book on the topic of managing a wealthy household.

We know that ice was stored underground for  summer use in the sixteenth century, but it tends to be associated with  extremes of courtly luxury on the tables of Renaissance princes. Coler  can hardly be suspected of keeping that kind of company, but he writes  in his agricultural calendar:\n\n***Ice***\n\n***(marginalia: to bring ice into the cellar)***\n\n***Have ice brought into your cellar in winter so that you may have a refreshing drink (*****einen frischen trunck*****) in summer. But beware that you do not gulp too cold things into you (*****in dich saeuffest*****) in the hot dog days and thus cause yourself a fever or death.***\n\nThe worry that very cold drinks could cause illness was widespread in  the sixteenth century, but we know that chilled drinks were widely  appreciated and especially wine cooled for drinking in dedicated  vessels. Adding ice to such a wine cooler would have been a welcome  boost to the refreshing quality of *k\u00fchler Wein*. It seems that  this was done a good deal further down the social ladder than we usually  think if a rural clergyman in Mecklenburg recommends it.\n\nJohann Coler\u2019s *Oeconomia ruralis et domestica* was a popular  book on the topic of managing a wealthy household.

You may also add saffron. Stir it together, then  put a little butter into the pan and pour in the mixed mass. This is a  good dish.***\n\nThe recipes as such are not terribly interesting. Basically, one is a  savoury bread pudding, the other a bread pancake. The addition of  sausages or smoked meat is interesting and potentially delicious, but at  the same time it is a luxury dish fit for a time of meat scarcity, when  even the wealthy need to make a sausage stretch. What makes them very  interesting indeed that both are referred to as *Semmelkloesse*, bread dumplings, despite the fact they clearly are no such thing. It seems the idea of what a *Semmelklo\u00df* is  was so soundly established at that point that an entirely different  kind of dish made with its characteristic ingredients could inherit the  name. \n\nWe should probably address the accompanying image, too. The picture is known as the *Kn\u00f6delesserin*, the dumpling eater, from the castle chapel of [Hocheppan ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgkapelle_Hocheppan)in  South Tyrol. Its paintings probably date to the early thirteenth  century, and the figure is often cited as the earliest evidence for  dumplings being eaten in the Alpine regions. In reality, fascinating  though it is, we really cannot say with any certainty what she is eating  other than that it is broadly round. \n\nJohann Coler\u2019s *Oeconomia ruralis et domestica* was a popular  book on the topic of managing a wealthy household.

{"title": "Cooking Porpoises (14th/15th c.)", "selftext": "Another entry in the Dorotheenkloster MS, not exactly a recipe:\n\n***186 (no title)***\n\n***You can make good dishes from a porpoise (merswein). They make good roasts, quite like other pigs do. You also make sausage and also good venison of their blood and the meat. And you can make pheffer (sauce dishes) from it and other good gemues (side dishes).***\n\nThis is more of a culinary briefing than a recipe, and it is clear why: No matter how healthy the ecosystem, nobody living in and around Vienna ever got to see a living porpoise, let alone cook one. The idea here is not instruction in any practical aspects of cookery, but in providing the kind of information an educated eater would be expected to have. Notably, in the second sentence a \u2018they\u2019 slips in \u2013 they cook porpoises. We have some practical recipes e.g. in the [*Opusculum de saporibus*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-opusculum-de-saporibus.pdf), but these are not that.\n\nThe descriptions are superficial, but interesting. Apparently, porpoises were cooked as meat despite the fact they were canonically classed as fish. Their name, *merswein*, literally sea pig, suggests as much, and here it is explicitly said they are treated like any other pig. Today, of course, the word *Meerschwein* refers to [a guinea pig](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/06/guinea-pig-recipes-from-marx-rumpolt/), but they are still called *Schweinswal* in modern German.\n\nIt is possible that salted or otherwise preserved porpoise meat was actually brought to the Alps. If it was, though, it was not likely a major trade item and certainly not usable for many of the dishes described here. Rather, these may have bewen familiar to people from their travels to coastal regions of Italy or Western Europe. The upper classes of fifteenth-century Europe often travelled widely, after all.\n\n(next day:)\n\nA propos of [yesterday\u2019s post of how to cook porpoises](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/07/cooking-porpoise/), these are more practical instructions from [Maino de Maineri\u2019s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maino_De_Maineri) [*opusculum de saporibus*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-opusculum-de-saporibus.pdf):\n\n*\u2026****About fish one must know that the grosser of flesh, the harder to digest and of greater superfluity and humoral nature (i.e. the more out of balance) they are, the more they need hotter and sharper condiments. And this is true not only for fish, but also for meat. From this follows that \u2018bestial\u2019 (animal-like) fish and especially the porpoise (lit. sea pig, porcus marinus), whether roasted or boiled, need hotter and sharper sauces. And this is similarly understood for other fish according to how much or little they resemble the porpoise.***\n\n***The condiment that is appropriate for the porpoise is strong boiled black pepper sauce whose composition is to be of of black pepper and cloves and toasted bread soaked in vinegar, and mixed with broth of fish.***\n\n***And if one should wish to preserve them for several days, a galantine is made whose composition is: Take cinnamon, galingale, and cloves and mix each two m. (unit of weight), (and) toasted bread, half a loaf worth two imperials (unit of currency). The bread has boiled wine vinegar poured over it. Thus galantine is made with the cooking liquid of water and wine used for the fish. And the fish are cooked in water and wine, and the galantine is to be sufficient for ten people.***\n\nWhile the anonymous author(s) of the Dorotheenkloster MS most likely described their porpoise dishes based on hearsay, it is likely that Maino de Maineri, a highly reputed Italian physician who wrote in the mid-14th century, had personal experience to go on. Porpoises were eaten in the Mediterranean, along with a wide variety of other sea fish. His medical advice concerns the condiments to serve them with.\n\nThe author clearly recognises the mammalian (\u201cbestial\u201d) nature of the porpoise, though this does not lead him to place it outside the class of fish. Rather, it represents one end of the spectrum within that class and, being so much like meat, requires spicy sauces. The one he recommends is actually a familiar one to German recipe readers \u2013 *pfeffer*, a highly seasoned sauce made with the cooking liquid and thickened with toasted bread. The powerful taste of black pepper and cloves heightened by vinegar was thought to counteract the cold and moist qualities of the porpoise.\n\nThe second recipe is harder to parse, but it seems to describe a galantine of the bread-thickened type. Here, a thick sauce is poured over cooked meat or fish to exclude the air as it congeals, preserving it for a short time. Seasoned with cinnamon, galanga, and cloves, it would impart a characteristic flavour to the meat.\n\nThis is clearly not the only way porpoises could be prepared. Maino de Maineri\u2019s work is focused on sauces which were considered medically indicated with many foods, not the culinary possibilities of an ingredient. But here, we at least have an idea of what was done with those porpoises.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1j6n2it/cooking_porpoises_14th15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741457425.0, "score": 3, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1j6n2it/cooking_porpoises_14th15th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Once again, from the collection of Philippine Welser:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lthsylyv8x0e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2b3f41ed103978f2e5ca9197ec4ae52c40c8ec6\n\n***221 Lamb meat in a soup***\n\n***Let the meat boil. Take 3 spoonfuls of the broth and 1 spoonful of vinegar, put that broth into a pan and let it cool. Beat 20 eggs into it, season it with saffron, pepper, and ginger, pass it through a cloth, then set it over coals and stir it until it develops foam. Put the meat into a bowl and pour the soup over it.***\n\nThis is a plain, straightforward recipe, though still a luxurious one. Using plenty of eggs and costly lamb distinguishes it more than the spices by the 1550s. My reading is as bite-sized meat chunks served in a spicy sauce, though of course we are told nowhere how the meat is cut. It could be entire legs sliced at the table. The sauce is simple \u2013 broth and vinegar, thickened with eggs and seasoned with sharp spices. It sounds quite attractive served with a good bread.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg.

Then pour good vinegar on it and let it lie in it for half an hour. Then take marjoram, rosemary, sage, or what good herbs you have together and also take three walnuts and a little juniper berries. Pound all of this together in a mortar. Also take pepper and ginger powder and stir it all together, and fill the fish with it. Then stick it on a wooden spit and lay it on a griddle. Let it roast at a low temperature (kiel bachen). Meanwhile, put vinegar in a small pan, add oil or butter, a little juniper berries, pepper, and saffron, let it boil together, and brush the fish with this as often as you turn it over until it is roasted.***\n\nI am quite fond of this recipe and actually redacted a modernised version of it for my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook). It is the best acount I know of how skilled cooks would prepare roast fish, which would most likely simply be recorded as such in any account, but actually take a fair bit of skill and ingredients.\n\nThe filling of ground walnuts and spices is reminiscent of the [roast eel in the same collection](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/08/a-filled-eel/) as well as earlier accounts of [walnut-based stuffings for roast meat](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/03/10/walnut-cheese-stuffing-experiment/) while the basting recalls the [roast pike also found in the same source](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/07/roast-pike/). The combination makes the recipe distinct, though. A savoury and very rich filling of herbs, spices, and walnuts and a generous baste of vinegar and butter on a slowly roasted fish is certainly promising. I have tried this with trout and feel sure it would be even better with larger freshwater fish.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Rub your hands with salt so it comes off easier. Then make pieces of it and cleanly take out the vein (ederlin = digestive tract). Put it in fresh water and let it lie in that for a good while, and salt the water. Then take it out and wash it cleanly with fresh water. Then take good wine, put in the fish, and use a lot of wine because it must boil thoroughly. When it is half done, add saffron, ginger, cinnamon, sugar, and a little cloves and let it boil nicely again so it is fully cooked. Then serve it with its broth.***\n\nThis recipe is, of course, thoroughly uninspired. Boiling fish in wine with spices is about as predictable as you can be in sixteenth-century Germany.

The famous [9th century \u201cPlan of St Gall\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_of_Saint_Gall) includes a fruit orchard, and the poem de cultura hortorum by [Walahfrid Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walafrid_Strabo), written on nearby Reichenau in the 9th century, lists an even more impressive array of fruit and vegetables. St Gall is located in the warmest and most fertile part of the German-speaking world, so peaches and even figs and pomegranates are not entirely implausible.\n\nHowever, the citrons mentioned in #179-180, the olives in #178, and the dates in #182 are clearly imported, as may the figs and pomegranates be. Dates as well as figs were dried for preservation while citrons, like pomegranates, could travel far before spoiling. Olives wold most likely have been dry-cured or brined. None of these can have been common fare.\n\nThere is little information about cooking, but it is likely that much if not most fruit would have been cooked. This is what other medical sources of the time recommend, and both #181 and #189 suggest. It is not quite clear what these *massis* in #181 are, but a fruit puree seems likely. Similarly, the mixture of apples and pears in #189 suggests some kind of prepared dish, maybe a sauce or compote. Similar preparations are attested in later recipe collections.\n\nThere is a good deal of classical allusion going on here, showing off the author\u2019s education. the Roman general Lucullus is indeed credited with bringing cherries to Italy, and the association with Iberia is attested, though this Iberia is a region in the Caucasus, not the Iberian peninsula. Ekkehart is most likely drawing on Isidore of Seville\u2019s Etymologiae for this snippet. The words *cerasia* and *amarina* may refer to tart and sweet cherries, as do the later German terms *Kirsche* and *Weichsel*.

Then turn them over in flour and fry them. Sprinkle sugar on them and serve them warm.***\n\nIt\u2019s not really much of a recipe, and I wonder how it got included, but it serves as a reminder that not every preparation needed to be elaborate to be popular. We actually can\u2019t be sure what fruit was used for it. The name *K\u00fcrbis* (spelled *kir wis*) still refers to both Old World *lagenaria* and New World *curcubita* crops. By 1550, American *curcubita* had become established in gardens throughout Europe to the point they were no longer seen as novelties, but as a regular type of gourd. It is a probable candidate, but so is *Lagenaria siceraria* bottle gourd. Most likely, that mattered less than the freshness and softness of the fruit on hand anyway.\n\nYou can fry pumpkin like that, and it even tastes rather good. Interestingly, it also seems that people in the general region have been doing it for quite a long time. Walafrid Strabo\u2019s ninth-century poem on gardening, the[ *liber de cultura hortorum* ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_de_cultura_hortorum), describes something that sounds strikingly similar:\n\n***\u2026inter opes transire ciborum / s\u00e6pe videmus, et ardenti sartagine pinguem / combibere arvinam, et placidum secmenta saporem / ebria multotiens mensis pr\u00e6stare secundis\u2026***\n\n***\u2026We often see them being passed around among a wealth of dishes, drinking the fat of the bubbling pan, and many times do the pieces of gentle flavour, having drunk their fill, stand out among the second course\u2026***\n\nThe *secunda mensa*, literally the second table or second course, was the final course in the Roman tradition. Fruit and sweet confections would be served at this point in the meal. Walafrid Strabo sees fried gourds (in his case obviously *Lagenaria siceraria*) fitting in here. The dish described by Philippine Welser is not a typical banquet dish in the Renaissance tradition, but it is also sweet. That need not mean it was envisioned as fruit or that this is a living tradition \u2013 but it could be. Dishes can be very long-lived once they are established.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day. Scandalously, she secretly married Archduke Ferdinand II of Habsburg in 1557 and followed him first to Bohemia, then to Tyrol. A number of manuscripts are associated with her, most famously a collection of medicinal recipes and one of mainly culinary ones. The recipe collection, addressed as her Kochbuch in German, was most likely produced around 1550 when she was a young woman in Augsburg.

The text depends on [Isidore of Seville\u2019s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville) 7th century [Etymologiae ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymologiae)in parts which is not surprising. That encyclopaedic description of the world was used widely as a teaching tool for Latin vocabulary, so the fact itself is not surprising. The question is whether the Benedictiones describe the reality of their time and place, or whether they are copying the literary setting of a different author. Looking at the fish in the Etymologiae (XII.6), we find that Ekkehart IV certainly did not merely copy his resource. Isidore\u2019s list of fish is extensive and solidly at home in the Mediterranean. There is very little overlap, and the Benedictiones feature many names that do not show up here. Also, the fish it mentions \u2013 to the extent that we can identify them with certainty \u2013 is plausible for a location in the Alps or Southern Germany. It seems that the author blessed what he knew.\n\nThe blessings unfortunately do not contain much information on preparation or seasoning, but even the list itself is worth having. Entries #39-41 do not refer to any fish species. #40 makes a reference to Creation when it states God \u2018mixes\u2019 fish into the waters of the world. However, we meet an identifiable fish in #42, and our first problem.\n\n*Balena* usually means a whale. This is not controversial or complicated. However, none of the translations I have found so far reads it as that. Cornel Dora renders it as *Stockfisch*, which would be dried cod from Scandinavia. This is a conjecture based on the idea that stockfish is more plausible as a trade good eaten in St Gall. [Keller ](https://books.google.de/books?id=PDUGAAAAQAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=%22Benedictiones+ad+Mensas%22&pg=PA347&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)suggests stockfish or tuna in his commentary, the latter because its size led to considering it a whale. Neither is entirely implausible, though the elkkeventh century is early for a bulk trade in stockfish. However, there was a trade in [salted whale meat](http://micmap.org/dicfro/search/dictionnaire-godefroy/craspois) from the French and Spanish Atlantic coasts. We cannot exclude the possibility that this, in fact, means what it says.\n\nOther fish are less mysterious. The *Huso*, German *Hausen* (*Huso huso*), mentioned in #43 is the Beluga sturgeon then still found in the Danube. This fish was considered a delicacy and traded over long distances. #45 is only slightly confusing. While *esox* is Latin for a pike, the manuscript includes a German gloss here that renders it as *lahs*, salmon. Keller adds that *esox* and *salmo* also described salmon at different stages in their lifecycle. *Illanch* in #46 refers to a very local fish, the *Illanke*. This is most likely *Coregonus wartmanni*, a whitefish species native to Lake Constance specifically and the mainstay of local fisheries. The name *rubulgra* in 47a, however, is obscure. Dora suggests char (*Salvelinus umbla*) as a guess based on plausibility and the association with the colour red in its German names. *Trisca* in #48 similarly is a cognate of *Tr\u00fcsche* (*Lota lota*).\n\nThe *lampreda* in #49 could be specifically the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) as opposed to the freshwater lamprey (*Lampetra fluviatilis*), which could explain the complaint about the price. Lampreys in general were high-status food, but transporting preserved ones from the coast to the shore of Lake Constance would have raised the price considerably. The freshwater lamprey would then be the \u2018nine-eyed eels\u2019 mentioned in #54. Lampreys are known as *Neunaugen* in German today, and the distinction between the sea and freshwater lamprey is sometimes made by referring to them as *Lamprete* and *Neunauge* respectively.\n\nEntry #52 again presents us with an unclear name, the *piscis Almarinus*, but a German gloss clarifies *harinch*, herring. Trade in salted Baltic herring (Clupea harengus) is attested archeologically by the eleventh century, and that must be how they reached the Alps. Entry #53 could also refer specifically to salt herring, though it may mean salt-preserved fish more generally.\n\nTaken together, while many of these fish are not local species, all of them were plausibly available in the region either caught or preserved as trade goods. This is not modest fare, but modesty is far from the author\u2019s mind anyway. We need to remember that both the Abbey of St Gall and the Archbishopric of Mainz, the two plasces where Ekkehart IV lived and worked, were at the heart of the rich and eminently political church establishment that supported the Holy Roman Empire. Abbot and archbishop were imperial princes \u2013 the former recognised as F\u00fcrstabt, the latter numbered among the seven Electors in later years. They deployed luxury as a tool of politics, if nothing else.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057.

Press the juice out thoroughly.  Then take a pound of sugar, well pounded, and put it into a bowl. Take  ginger to the value of one kraytzer and pepper to the same value, and a little salt, all pounded small. Further take eight eggs and a quarter (qwerttlich)  milk, or a little more. Then take the above juice, mix it all together,  coat the pan with butter and make the base as thin as possible. Have a  care with the embers, you must often lift the lid and make sure that it  doesn\u2019t burn. It takes much effort. It is written that you should not  use any base, but only flour strewn over the butter.***\n\nThis is a fascinating recipe that doesn\u2019t really need much in the way  of guesswork. The \u201cquarter\u201d of milk probably refers to a quarter of a  Ma\u00df, somewhere in the reqion of a cup. The spice measure is less  certain, given how much prices could fluictuate, but it illustrates  neatly that at this point, spices were still a luxury item. The Kreuzer  referenced here was a silver alloy coin valued at 1/60 of a Gulden and  represented somewhere around 10-20% of a day\u2019s wage for a labourer.  Spending that amount was not bank-breaking, but it is still the rough  equivalent of putting 30-40 Euros worth of one ingredient into one dish.  It is not a trivial expense unless you are someone like the Welser  family. \n\nI expect the consistency that is aimed for is a light, soft custard,  slowly cooked at a gentle heat. The herb juice would coour it an even  green, and of course it would be very sweet.

But when you wish to prepare it, pour on almond milk and set it on the  coals, and stir it so that it stays whole, When it begins to thicken,  whiten it with the milk. If you wish to know whether it is fully cooked,  take three grains between the fingers. If they disintegrate like cheese  curds (als die ziger) so that nothing hard remains, it is done. Serve it with sugar.***\n\nThis matches the ingredients and quantities recorded in the [Tegernsee list](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/08/mus-dishes-from-the-tegernsee-list/) remarkably well: \n\n***Rice Mus (Reismue\u00df): For rice, ane large heaped bowl (n\u00e4pfel) of rice and one level one, that makes six pounds, and of almonds one small heaped bowl (n\u00e4pfel) and one level one, that makes two pounds of almonds.***\n\nBetween these two, we can begin to reconstruct an actual recipe. Of  course it is still not entirely clear how much almond milk is prepared  from two pounds of almonds, but the general proportion makes sense. This  is how we get closer to as better understanding of medieval cuisine.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound  with a set of manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and  theology. There is a note inside the book stating it was completed in  1439 and, in a different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the  monastery at Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript  already included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The  entire codex was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth  century, so at this point the recipe collection must have been part of  it.

Then boil it until you can see the white kernel.  Then let it dry very well and pound it until the kernels become clean (*****lauter*****).***\n\nThis is interesting because we do not often get to see these things  described in cookbooks. In modern kitchens, of course, we get our  ingredients ready to use, and oats mainly rolled flat for muesli.  Medieval cooks would often get relatively unprocessed ingredients,  especially in large households that received rents in kind. Nobles, but  also cities, wealthy burghers, and church institutions often held land  whose tenants owed them part of the produce, so at certain times there  would be eggs, butter, and cheese, grain, legumes, but also live animals  and fresh fish coming in. Oats were a common porridge grain as well as  animal feed, but needed to be processed to be acceptable on a  higher-status table.  \n\nHere, the grains are boiled until the hulls burst, then dried and  most likely worked in a mortar until the papers hull detaches from the  kernel. Today, this tends to be done in industrial mills prior to  rolling or grinding the oats. I do not think I ever saw hulled whole oat  grains sold anywhere, and I am curious what boiling them for a porridge  would produce. The quantity in question \u2013 a [*Metzen* ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metzen_(Hohlma%C3%9F))would be somewhere around thirty litres \u2013 suggests this was done to keep the hulled grains for future use.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound  with a set of manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and  theology.

The process seems simple enough: Sugar (in this case, 150 grammes) is  heated in a pan together with some liquid, 100 ml of water in this case.  Once the sugar is completely dissolved and boiling, almonds or nuts are  added and the whole mess stirred until the sugar solidifies, at which  point it is turned out onto a smooth, cool surface (traditionally  marble, in my kitchen baking paper) and allowed to cool. If it worked,  you should have hard, dry, sugar-coated almonds with whatever flavouring  you added to them. If it went wrong, you will either have a sticky mess  or a burned one.  I half managed it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kschvrrlrv9c1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32c0b2b10405a27701cfbf300a73f018a2ca211d\n\n Like most traditional holiday treats, *gebrannte Mandeln* have  long antecedents and a broader tradition behind them. When sugar was a  rare treat, they could obtained from the apothecary. In 1581, Marx  Rumpolt gives the following list and instruction: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/diq9zx9qrv9c1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d87ba0f451e5ecb6a773f0a726d24998161cc8d\n\n ***Of all manner of sugar confits to be obtained from the apothecary*** \n\n***1 sugarcoated almonds***\n\n***2 sugarcoated anise***\n\n***3 sugarcoated cinnamon bark***\n\n***4 sugarcoated cloves***\n\n***5 sugarcoated coriander***\n\n***6 sugarcoated caraway***\n\n***7 sugarcoated fennelseed***\n\n***8 sugarcoated pine nuts***\n\n***9 sugarcoated walnuts***\n\n***10 sugarcoated hazelnuts***\n\n***11 sugarcoated peach kernels***\n\n***12 sugarcoated lemon peel***\n\n***13 sugarcoated apricot kernels*** \n\n***14 sugarcoated kernels of all kinds of plums***\n\n***15 sugarcoated kernels of all kinds of cherries***\n\n***16 sugarcoated chestnuts***\n\n***17 sugarcoated bitter orange peel***\n\n***18 sugarcoated lime peel***\n\n***19 sugarcoated chicory root***\n\n***20 sugarcoated pimpernel root***\n\n***21 sugarcoated elecampagne root***\n\n***22 sugarcoated skirret root***\n\n***23 sugarcoated violet root***\n\n***24 sugarcoated ginger***\n\n***25 of all kinds of roots that  have a pleasant scent***\n\n***If you wish to coat this manner of confit with sugar,  take a clean copper basin that has two handles and hang it up high with a  rope through both handles. Set a brazier with glowing coals beneath it,  then place the confit in the basin and warm it nicely. Pour fine  clarified sugar over it and frequently stir it until the confit takes  the sugar to itself. Thus it will turn out nicely white and dry. Thus  you also coat all manner of seeds and spices with sugar and it will turn  out good and well-tasting.*** (p. clxxix)\n\nThis is a simple, but challenging process. You need to control the  heat, the movement, and the liquid content of the sugar to get the  result you are aiming for. [Clarified sugar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/11/clarifying-sugar/), it should be said, is liquid, [a thick syrup](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/30/clarifying-sugar-after-walter-ryff/),  not a solid. We have many surviving descriptions of the process. Adding  this syrup, ideally gradually, and coating the material at a gentle  heat would produce the smooth white crust Rumpolt is aiming for. Modern *gebrannte Mandeln*  are deliberately caramelised and brown. You can still buy traditionally  sugarcoated fennelseeds and anise in Indian and Middle Eastern  groceries and I sometimes serve them as an accompaniment to Renaissance  dishes, sprinkled on top just before serving, as was custom in  sixteenth-century Germany.

{"title": "Pike Cooked Three Ways (15th c.)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/13/another-fish-cooked-three-ways/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/13/another-fish-cooked-three-ways/)\n\n This recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch is familiar from many other sources, but is more detailed than most: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qw73kk0tc46c1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b4e6049b57b587222d9e2b70560e551508eaff0\n\n***112 A pike that is boiled in the middle and roasted at either end***\n\n***Take a white cloth that is one hand wide or wider and  moisten it with wine. Take out the stomach and the liver so the stomach  stays whole. Take a piece of another pike and fill the stomach with it.  Add fat and let the liver and the stomach boil until they are done,  (but) so that the liver stays whole. Fill the pike again so the liver  and the stomach stay together in the middle of the pike. Take the cloth  and moisten it, and it must be long enough to go around twice. Wrap it  around the pike. When you have wrapped it around, wrap it around again  (with a second cloth). Salt it and wrap the cloth over the salt, and  season the pike all over the back and all around. It should be salted on  bopth ends all around (and) between the two cloths. How take a thread  and wind it around and around. The cloth must be fourfold. Take and  scale (the fish) at both ends. When you wish to roast it, take a spit  and thrust it through the cloth, thus it stays more whole (gantzer).  Salt it like a roast fish and take two bricks, lay them at the corners  (of the fireplace) and lay the spit on them and roast it like any other  fish. Put good fire under the cloth, but a small fire under the other  parts. And you shall take broth. Where you wish to boil the pike, you  shall pour that over the cloth so it does not burn. That way the fish  boils under the cloth (in der pinten). And you shall take small  pebbles that are hot and stick them under the cloth and pour hot broth  over the cloth. Thus it runs over the stones and the pike boils nicely.  Just roast it properly.***\n\n***113 To prepare two sauces and a soup for the pike***\n\n***With the tail, prepare a green sauce. Pass it through  with vinegar, thus it becomes sharp, and add spices to it. For the head,  take a fierdung of raisins and half a fierdung of almonds, and skin those nicely. Pound the almonds and raisins together.***\n\n***If you wish to have a good sauce, pass the herbs and the bread through a cloth with rainfal (Ribolla gialla wine) or rumenier (Romania wine). Add good spices and sugar to it, thus you have a good sauce.***\n\nThe underlying recipe here is for preparing a single, large fish so  that different sections are cooked in different styles, typically one  roasted, one boiled or steamed, and one fried. We have [numerous recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/16/a-fish-cooked-three-ways-from-meister-eberhard/) for this from [various sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/19/one-fish-cooked-three-ways-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) and the process seems to go back to Abbasid Baghdad where it is recorded in the recipebook of [ibn Sayyar al Warraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Sayyar_al-Warraq)  (chapter 33, recipe 5). Surviving German recipes often differ in  detail, sometimes cutting apart the fish and reassembling it, but the  most impressive display of skill lay in keeping it whole, as this  iteration does. \n\nThe instructions we are getting here mainly focus on the way of  preparing the middle part which is boiled (or rather steamed) under a  wet cloth. The front and rear parts are not treated in any detail, but  we learn in a [different recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/16/a-fish-cooked-three-ways-from-meister-eberhard/)  that one section would be roasted dry, the other dusted with flour and  basted with fat. All of it would make a showy dish served with various  sauces to accompany each part. It probably does not need saying that  between calling for fresh pike and the most expensive wines, expending a  vast amount of skilled labour, and probably ruining a perfectly good  length of linen, this recipe represents a level of luxury bordering on  decadence.   \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.

When you  wish to eat, put this in wine and stir in fat, eggs, pepper, or whatever  you have enough of.***\n\nThere is, again, a very close parallel in Meister Hans: \n\n***#78 A dish of white bread***\n\n***Item dry white bread and grate it through a sieve. Keep  that in a leather bag so that it does not become wet. When you wish to  eat it, lay it (out) and add to it fat, eggs, pepper or whatever you can  get much of.***\n\nI suspect the Meister Hans manuscript has the intent of the recipe  better. This is not about sauces, but about all kinds of foods. Laying  in a supply of white breadcrumbs, and potentially even carrying it on  journeys, made sense in an environment  where this kind of bread was an  important ingredient in upper-class cuisine, but not universally  available. And you can basically make anything with it \u2013 there are a  host of recipes from soups and porridges to pancakes and mortar cakes  that use grated bread. Eggs, meat, and dairy would be easier to source.  As an  aside, using a leather bag to keep the breadcrumbs dry makes the  whole thing ring true. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

When it is  roasted, let it cool. Take the crust of bread, pepper, ginger, caraway,  and vinegar and grind this together and boil it up so it becomes evenly  thick. Lay it (the meat) into the sauce. Also serve roast and roasted  hare to lords in the same sauce.***\n\nThis recipe is not particularly interesting or unusual. It uses the same combination of spices as the [roe deer baked in as crust](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/26/roe-deer-back-roast-in-crust/),  which suggests this was an established flavour for venison. Other than  that, it is a bread-thickened spicy sauce, the kind that is often  referred to as a *pfeffer* in other sauces. These are quite common. The wording seems oddly reminiscent of the Harpestreng tradition\u2019s [salsa dominorum](https://atasteofhistorywithjoycewhite.blogspot.com/2014/09/a-bold-12th-century-sauce-for-lords.html), but the two are not visibly related beyond the shared general principle. \n\nI  find the cooking instructions intriguing. Venison to be kept in a  sauce \u2013 this is presumably a form of food preservation, a ready meal on  hand \u2013 is basted, not larded. It may be something to do with the keeping  qualities, but I have not tried the two methods to compare. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set  of manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

Especially the one on nettle has disturbing implications. \n\nThe [Macer Floridus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macer_floridus)  is a herbal that was extremely popular throughout the Middle Ages and  the Renaissance in all of Europe, and especially in Germany. It was most  likely written in the mid-eleventh century by Odo of Meung, but this is  somewhat uncertain and the early version could date from as early as  the ninth century. Its final form of 77 chapters, drawing on material  from Constantinus Africanus, certainly existed by 1100. We know with  certainty that it was not authored by the classical Roman writer [Aemilius Macer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilius_Macer)to whom early editors ascribed it.\n\nThe Macer is a relatively brief treatment of the pharmaceutical  properties of various plants, drawing on various classical and medieval  sources. It does not contain culinary recipes, but some remarks in it  are nonetheless interesting from that perspective. I excerpted several  paragraphs I found interesting with a view to culinary preparation,  feasting, and lifestyle medicine. It should not need saying that these  are not medical recommendations. While some recipes in Macer may  actually have an appreciable effect, others can be seriously dangerous,  and none hold up to modern evidence-based practice.\n\nI am relying on the [scholarly edition of 1834](https://archive.org/details/deviribusherbaru00mace/page/28/mode/2up) and a German translation by Johannes Gottfried Mayer and Konrad Goehl that is [still in print](https://www.froelichundkaufmann.de/ratgeber/kraeuterbuch-der-klostermedizin-der-macer-floridus.html).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1815fd7/aphrodisiacs_from_the_macer_floridus_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1700645953.0, "score": 4, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1815fd7/aphrodisiacs_from_the_macer_floridus_11th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Rubbing the vulva with nettle leaves?!?!?!\n\n\nJust reading that was enough to give me the shivers.

{"title": "Herbs in Small Cheese", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/19/450-years-of-herbs-in-cheese/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/19/450-years-of-herbs-in-cheese/)\n\n Today, I wanted to post another small detail from the Macer Floridus, this one pertaining to making cheese: \n\n \n\n***1583 Its (mint) juice aids small cheeses not to rot if it is added or the green herb is placed upon the cheese.***\n\nThere is not a lot here, but the passage is interesting in that it  indicates different sizes and types of cheese existed, and that storing  them was considered challenging. Mint has certain antiseptic properties  and probably works better at preserving cheeses than as a contraceptive  pessary (line 1581 in the same text \u2013 ouch). \n\nNow, small cheeses and herbs go together in all kinds of ways, and  the much later Oeconomia ruralis et domestica by Johannes Coler lays  this out in much greater detail: \n\n***(Marginalia: Sage cheese or marjoram cheese or pepperwort cheese, how these should be made)***\n\n***You make sage cheese or marjoram cheese or pepperwort  cheese this way: First, you lay a handful of curds into the cheese  strainer, then you lay in a sage leaf or two or three next to each other  onto the mats, then you throw on a handful of curds more.***\n\n***(Marginalia: to make*** **Querge*****)***\n\n***If you wish to prepare*** **Querge*****, put renneted  curds into a sack and lay a stone on it so it presses out the whey.  After an hour, put it into a bowl, knead it, and leave it standing for  eight days. When you wish to prepare*** **Querge*****, you put in beforehand what you wish. You put in saffron to make it yellow, you put in caraway, and then you shape the*** **Querge** ***in  many forms as you please, with two, three or four points so it is a joy  to see. Or you cut sage leaves or marjoram or pepperwort, or you add  mustard seed, or what else you want that is healthy to people. Then you  lay them on a cheese basket in a drying attic (*****Darren*****) or on  hurdles and let them dry in the air. They do not turn out well in heated  rooms. Many hang them in the smoke, but these also do not turn out  good. Then you lay them in a heap in a pantry or or into a chest, or in  casks, that way they will turn out good.***\n\n***(Marginalia: Cheeses that are tough, how to make them crumbly (*****m\u00fcrbe*****))***\n\n***When the cheeses are too hard and tough, sprinkle them  with beer or salt water and store them in a cask or chest on top of each  other, that way they will turn out good and crumbly. Some like them  maggoty and only strew on flour, despite the fact that they easily  become maggoty on their own and you can well do without maggots in your  cheese. Cheeses that are old and tough are very unhealthy, and the  closer cheeses are to milk , the healthier and more digestible they are.  See above the thirtieth chapter.***\n\n***The LXXI Chapter: How to Guard Cheeses against Worms***\n\n***(Marginalia: To guard cheese against worms)***\n\n***Aureolus Theophrast: Paracelsus Liber 3*** **de natura rerum** ***at the end writes that you should lay the herb*** **hyppericon** ***or*** **perforatam*****,  also known as St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), with cheeses. This  has the wondrous power of guarding cheese from all worms. When you  simply lay it next to or upon the cheeses just so that it touches them,  no worm will grow within. If there are any worms inside already, they  must all die and drop out. That is why a householder should always have  this herb on hand, owing to its great power, virtue, and efficacy.***\n\n***The LXXII Chapter: Of Cheeses that are Very Hard or Tough***\n\n***(Marginalia: to make cheeses that are hard or tough become crumbly)***\n\n***If you wish to make hard or tough cheeses crumbly (*****m\u00fcrbe*****), take*** **Mihr** ***or*** **Meier** ***(this is a herb that grows among cabbages; it is similar to marjoram and comes in two kinds, white and red), and beet leaves (*****Beete** ***oder*** **Beisse*****), the learned call it*** **Betam*****.  There are also two kinds, the red of which we make red beets, and the  white with which you fatten pigs. Take these two herbs together and lay a  layer of them into a cask, then a layer of cheeses, then again a layer  of*** **Meier** ***and*** **Beta*****, and a layer of cheese, and so forth, and thus set it in a cellar.***\n\n*Querge* (cognate with *Quark*) seems to be a kind of *Handk\u00e4se*, homemade small cheeses made with buttermilk that are low in fat and high in protein. *Meier* is most likely oregano (Origanum vulgare), also known as *Dost* or *Meierkraut* in  modern German dialects. Now this is a universe of practical knowledge,  and we are likely barely scratching the surface even here. The problem  this illustrates is that our sources for the early centuries of the  medieval period are few and sparse, but we often find parallels with  later, better documented practices. The question then is how far we can  take these parallels. In this matter, I am a confessed maximalist. there  is nothing in the Oeconomia that is inherently improbable in 1160, no  tool or ingredient unknown, and I believe we are looking, in broad  terms, at a continuous tradition. I can\u2019t prove it, though. \n\nJohann Coler\u2019s *Oeconomia ruralis et domestica* was a popular  book on the topic of managing a wealthy household. It is based largely  on previous writings by Coler and first appeared between 1596 and 1601.  Repeatedly reprinted for decades, it became one of the most influential  early works of *Hausv\u00e4terliteratur*. I am working from a 1645 edition.\n\nThe [Macer Floridus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macer_floridus)  is a herbal that was extremely popular throughout the Middle Ages and  the Renaissance in all of Europe, and especially in Germany. It was most  likely written in the mid-eleventh century by Odo of Meung, but this is  somewhat uncertain and the early version could date from as early as  the ninth century. Its final form of 77 chapters, drawing on material  from Constantinus Africanus, certainly existed by 1100. We know with  certainty that it was not authored by the classical Roman writer [Aemilius Macer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilius_Macer)to whom early editors ascribed it.\n\nThe Macer is a relatively brief treatment of the pharmaceutical  properties of various plants, drawing on various classical and medieval  sources. It does not contain culinary recipes, but some remarks in it  are nonetheless interesting from that perspective. I excerpted several  paragraphs I found interesting with a view to culinary preparation,  feasting, and lifestyle medicine. It should not need saying that these  are not medical recommendations. While some recipes in Macer may  actually have an appreciable effect, others can be seriously dangerous,  and none hold up to modern evidence-based practice.\n\nI am relying on the [scholarly edition of 1834](https://archive.org/details/deviribusherbaru00mace/page/28/mode/2up) and a German translation by Johannes Gottfried Mayer and Konrad Goehl that is [still in print](https://www.froelichundkaufmann.de/ratgeber/kraeuterbuch-der-klostermedizin-der-macer-floridus.html).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17z5hri/herbs_in_small_cheese/", "created_utc": 1700424044.0, "score": 4, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/17z5hri/herbs_in_small_cheese/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Apologies, reddfit sometimes screws up formating in transfer and the edit function seems to have disappeared in its effort to become more like Facebook.", "Ironic that they claim fresh cheeses are more digestible than harder aged ones, when in reality the opposite is the case if you\u2019re lactose intolerant!"]}

Most of what I am translating pertains to what we would  call cosmetics, wellness, and lifestyle medicine, though there are also a  remarkable number of aphrodisiacs. Here is the first bit: \n\n ***1137 Its decoction (of bugloss) is said to produce joyful gatherings if sprinkled among the guests.*** \n\n \n\n***1878 Its decoction (of vervain), made in wine, makes happy guests if sprinkled among a gathering like bugloss described above***.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI knew that stone and earth floors were covered with straw or rushes  for social gatherings and that it was  customary to use fresh coverings  mixed with fragrant herbs when possible for honoured guests. This was  not the disgustingly unhygienic habit it is sometimes cast as, and the  scent of fresh grass or hay can be pleasant. I had not been aware that  herbal decoctions were also used to enhance the dining experience. \n\nPersonally, I would choose neither bugloss nor vervain as my  favourite dining room air freshener, but the expectation that they  would raise the spirits of the guests must have helped with the placebo  effect. It certainly calls for a revision of the entrenched view that  medieval interiors were stinky, smoky places where smells were something  to be suffered rather than enjoyed.  \n\nThe [Macer Floridus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macer_floridus) or *de viribus herbarum*  is a herbal in the form of a didactic poem that was extremely popular  throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in all of Europe, and  especially in Germany.

The dish itself is also interesting and potentially  attractive, a rich, meaty and strongly seasoned fritter to serve with a  fruity, sweet-sour sauce. As to the second clear parallel between the  probably pre-1439 Mondseer Kochbuch and the 1460 Meister Hans  manuscript, there clearly is a shared source there. I already commented  on this on more detail yesterday. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it.

Make cheese of what remains on the cloth.  If you wish to make butter from it, let a little saffron boil with it,  and serve that.***\n\n\u2026\n\n***65 A cheese (*****ziger oder schotten*****) of almond milk***\n\n***Take almond kernels and pound them in a mortar.

And take the milk and  boil it up and pour it out on a cloth and let it cool, and lay that  into a cheese strainer (*****kes nappff*****) and prepare a cheese. Lay it on a plate and strew it with sugar. This is called an almond cheese.***\n\n***67 How to prepare a*** **wel** ***(*****weck*****? \u2013 breadroll) of almonds***\n\n***Take almond kernels pounded into a milk and boil it and  pour it onto a cloth and let it cool. Make what remains into a breadroll  (*****wechen*****) and put it on as serving bowl, and pour almond milk underneath it. Strew sugar on it and serve it.***\n\n\u2026\n\n***98 Almond cheese***\n\n***If you wish to have an almond cheese, you must have isinglass and you must have 1 \u00bd*** **libra** ***of  almonds to a dish. With the almonds, you do this: Grind them finely and  pass them through a white cloth, and you shall boil one lot of  isinglass in water, and you should pass the isinglass through with the  almonds and the boiled water, but the (almond) milk should not boil.  Make it sweet with a*** **vierdung** ***of sugar and form (*****schik*****) it into a cheese. Take a glazed bowl (*****verglast reinlen*****)  and put the milk into this. Thus is turns hard. And let it stand for a  while, thus it becomes a cheese. And add sweet almond milk to it. You  can well cut it into quarters, that way the milk gets inbetween, and  stick it with almond kernels and serve it.***\n\nThe variety in a single source is interesting. recipe #37 is  almost  certainly a way of acid-coagulating almond milk while #98 is a  straightforward jelly. With the others, it is hard to say what holds  them together. The unusually precise figures in #98 \u2013 one and a half  pounds of almonds, a quarter pound of sugar \u2013 give us a reasonable  chance of replicating the taste. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

I had hoped to get small sardines or whitebait of some  kind, but the smallest fish the shop carried that day were immature  milkfish. These are, of course, a Pacific species, but I still wanted to  try the sauce and so I went ahead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ca06l155honb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca4f243f7dcfe857d9669712ca74c01b9ab60de9\n\n \n\nThe technique of cooking the fish \u2018between two plates\u2019 is a familiar  and traditional one in which two ceramic bowls are inverted over each  other to produce an enclosed space, sometimes closed with water paste or  clay, and placed near the fire. Today, this is easiest to replicate  using a deep pan with a lid on a low heat. I melted butter in it,  dropped in orange skin, herbs, salt and pepper, and added the fish one  it was hot enough to gently cook it. As soon as the fish were cooked on  one side, I flipped them over. After removing the orange skin, I added  a  good splash of vinegar and some water because I was concerned the whole  was getting too dry. After another miunute of cooking, I removed the  fish and tried to thicken the liquid with egg yolk. I mis-guessed badly  and produced more of a scrambled egg than a sauce, but it tasted rather  good. So I returned the fish to it and served it with a pinch of nutmeg.   \n\nI now assume the original dish is intended to be deeper and more  liquid, and the fish, being quite small, will fall apart in cooking. The  result would be a kind of fish stew rather than discrete fish in sauce,  which I tried to achieve. But the taste was very good.

They are prepared with sugar, cinnamon, and a little lemon or orange peel. Note that the Spanish call the*** **figue d\u2019Amerique** ***the*** **banane** ***and the*** **banane** ***the*** **plantain**.\n\nThe good father\u2019s linguistic bemusement is understandable. The word  families surrounding banana and plantain were used to refer to various  fruit of the genus throughout the 17th and 18th centuries not just in  different European languages, but by different writers in the same  language. Following his description, though, we can be quite certain  that what Labat calls a *figue d\u2019Amerique*, an \u201cAmerican fig\u201d, is what we would call a banana today, though one smaller and rounder than out modern [Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana). That gave me the first indication modern bananas would not be out of place in this recipe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tv7j9msk9hnb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07a1461bb24027232ee93c2a7b21700c36e67c96\n\nThe second question was what Labat meant by a tarte. In  seventeenth-century usage, those  could be both open and enclosed, much  like pie in modern English, and there are descriptions of several kinds  of edible crust. Those crusts were typically \u2018short\u2019 by having fat  and/or eggs added. I decided to go with a modern *tarte* crust because I was much more interested in the filling.\n\nThe next question was how to prepare the filling, and here again  parallel recipes are little help. It turns out fruit could be put into *tartes* raw,  pre-cooked, or turned into a mash, and Labat gives no indication which  he means. For my first experiment, I mashed banana with sugar, cinnamon,  and lemnon peep. The fruit almost immediately liquefied and though the  small hand pies I made were acceptable, the filling leaked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/swods9sn9hnb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85c8bc399d0e6bd35ea4adf9e2d1d817eafceefc\n\nSo this time, I sliced the bananas thinly and layered them in a pie dish  lined with crust. The first layer was topped off with sugar, cinnamon,  and fresh zest. One tart was prepared with orange and two with lemon to  see how the result varied. A second layer of banana slices followed, and  then we covered one of the tartes with a lid and the other two with a  latticework of strips leaving some space between. That way we could see  whether the taste would differ between an open and enclosed filling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhi0l8lr9hnb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1949e4058dfd4a933bcf7a1105a57840fe7f8ed6\n\nThe closed *tarte* was the clear favourite. Open to the air, the  bananas quickly turned an unappetising brown and dried out. The filling  in the closed *tarte* stayed white and juicy and retained a  fresher taste. We also found that the orange zest complemented it  better. I am happy with this recipe, but will try variations with  plantains, sliced raw and pre-cooked, and weith smaller, more aromatic  bananas if I can get them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16f8tp9/banana_pie_late_17th_c/", "created_utc": 1694373315.0, "score": 4, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16f8tp9/banana_pie_late_17th_c/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Soften it in cold water and take it out, and press it (out?) in vinegar,  (but) so that it stays whole. Tie it to two lengths of wood (*****schin*****)  and lay it on a wooden griddle, and spread out the fire everywhere  under it so that it warms. Drizzle it well with butter. Then prepare a  nice batter of white flour and of eggs. Add pounded pepper or sugar and a  little saffron. Salt it in measure and drizzle it on the fish. Pour on  (?*** **slag den taig dar auff*****)  when the fish is very hot, and put coals underneath it until it turns  red. Treat it thus before you take it down, drizzle it strongly with  butter and serve it.***\n\nAs it stands, this recipe would probably fairly earn an epithet like  \u2018nice\u2019. It\u2019s white fish in a  flour-based batter, grilled over the coals  with plenty of butter. Obviously, you can\u2019t serve chips with it in a  historical context, but you really want to. \n\nThe technical challenge of it lies in the initial stage. Skinning  stockfish \u2013 air-dried Atlantic cod \u2013 is no easy undertaking, and there  was an art to softening it that is reflected in [many ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/13/stockfish-from-the-oeconomia/)[later ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/11/preparing-dried-fish-after-the-oeconomia/)[sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/08/stockfish-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/).  My practical experience is limited, and I am not confident at all I  could get a side of stockfish soaked and skinned in one piece. Securing  it firmly to wooden boards is sound advice (much like today\u2019s [plankefisk](https://northwildkitchen.com/viking-plankefisk/)) to keep if from falling apart while cooking. \n\nAnother interesting point is that this fish could end up with an  interesting flavour, depending on how you interpret the recipe. The  instruction to press it in vinegar to me suggests that the fully  reconstituted fish is pressed out in a dish of vinegar, infusing it with  that sour tang. Depending on long and thoroughly this was done, you  could get something much like we get today when we lightly drizzle fresh  fish with lemon juice before cooking, but also something much more  vinegar-foward. The former probably would work well with the suggested  batter seasoned with pepper and saffron. The latter might pair more  interestingly with the alternative, sugar. I wonder how that would work.  I used to think sugar was used in homeopathic doses in such recipes,  but there are references to[ quite generous quantities ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/09/almond-cherry-mousse-new-source/)in the same source, so it could actually be a striking *agrodolce* if done right. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

The figs, only briefly parboiled, soaked  up some of the liquid with its spices and became quite soft, almost  gelatinous.

I took the opportunity to translate a longer recipe. Walter Ryff is verbose:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjhrdf1s6xhb1.jpg?width=1464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64e4fccdbe3f5a0084db1066687c7e6efb173172\n\n***To prepare a fine, useful and good quince electuary***\n\n***\u2026 In this first part, we will most carefully describe the  most common electuaries that are made in many form from may different  fruit, herbs, roots, seeds, spices and the like. Firstly, quince  electuary which is used by well-equipped apothecaries and diligent  householders for medicine and is thought a strengthening food.***\n\n***This electuary is mainly prepared from quinces, whence it derives its name*** **Conditum Contoneorum**.  ***The fruit has a lovely and fresh scent, but is or rough taste which is  why it is entirely unsuitable for eating raw. If too much is eaten raw,  it is entirely impossible to digest, but cooked and prepared in many  ways they strengthen the stomach, constipate the belly if they are eaten  before other food, move urine, close the stomach, especially if they  are very rough, and still the disgust and vomiting of the stomach. But  if quinces are used after other foods, they loosen the belly. Quinces  also have a lovely and sweet wine juice*** (***Weinsafft***) ***which is why they suppress all evil vapours that rise up from the stomach.***\n\n***Quince juice that is drunk or quinces chewed in the mouth  defend against drunkenness. The ancients also assure us credibly that  is a pregnant woman frequently enjoyed quinces, the child would be very  nimble, of good wits and sharp reasoning.***\n\n***This fruit is of many kinds which the ancients referred  to by name and distinguished by the manner of their planting. But in  this country, we mainly only have two kinds of quinces: Common quinces  are small, knot-shaped or full of uneven parts (******knorren******), rough, harsh, and have large cores (******sehr steinig******).  The other kind are smoother, milder, more tender, also larger and of  sweeter and lovelier scent and flavour. That is why they should mainly  be chosen for all apothecaries\u2019 preparations. Of such quinces, a useful  electuary is prepared in the following manner: Take as many quinces that  are quite ripe as you wish and peel them thoroughly. Cut off the stems,  cores, inner seeds and whatever else is hard (******steining******) away.  But you must not throw away the seeds because they can usefully applied  to many purposes. Place these quinces in a new earthen pot that is well  glazed and cleanly singed*** (**ausgebrannt** ***\u2013 sterilised over flame)  and pour on good tart wine, but not too much, only so they are steamed  in it and turn to mush. There are, though, many differences in the way  of doing this. Some use only fresh well water, others the pressed juice  of several quinces which is strongest, others again use no addition at  all, but secure (verpreissen) the cut quince slices in a pot  with small wooden skewers. They invert that pot over another in which  there is wine or water and make a strong coal fire all around. Thus they  let it cook in the steam and let them become very soft. You may do this  as you please, only see that the quinces are quite soft and turn to  mush so you can pass them neatly and entirely through a hair sieve,  haircloth, or another commonly used linen cloth so that whatever is left  of the skin, cores, or their like is separated and only the tender,  pure pulp (mark) passes through.***\n\n***The ancients used one pound each of strong, potent  vinegar of white wine and clarified and well-scummed honey to one pound  of this pulp. These three ingredients are boiled well together so that  they acquire the proper and suitable thickness. Afterwards, the  following powder is added: Take six*** **Loth** ***each of black pepper and white, cleanly scraped ginger, two*** **Loth** ***of parsley seed, which many translate into German as masterwort (Meisternw\u00fcrtzel) seed and others as pimpernel seed, and mix that powder into it for an electuary.***\n\n***Further, such an electuary was also prepared among the  ancients in another manner. Namely, you take the pressed-out juice of  the finest quinces and well-scummed honey, one pound each, and half a  pound of sharp wine vinegar. Let it boil as is described afterwards,  namely so that it acquires the thickness of the honey. Then mix in the  following powder: Take three*** **Loth** ***of carefully chosen scraped white ginger and two*** **Loth** ***of  white pepper, or in its stead of common black pepper, stir it all well  together and let it boil to a suitable thickness. But when the ancients  wished to give their quince electuary to people of hot complexion, and  especially those who have much gall in their stomachs, they did not add  these spices, but only for those who had cold, phlegmy stomachs and were  more phlegmatic and \u2018liquid\u2019 (fl\u00fcssiger) by nature.***\n\n***But in our time, quince electuary is prepared in a much  more elegant and stronger manner by apothecaries and diligent  householders. You take three pounds of the passed-through pulp of the  quinces and four pounds of clear, well-scummed honey, and let it boil  well together, steadily stirring with a wooden paddle*** (***spatel***)  ***or a small shovel made for the purpose until it begins to thicken. Then  let a little of it fall on cold iron, cold stone, or the bottom of a  mortar so it cools. If it has boiled enough, it can then be easily  detached*** (**abschelen** ***\u2013 lit. peel off) and does not stick to the  fingers either but comes off easily and dry. Then lift it off the fire  and and stir in the following spices (Species) or powder: Take three and a half*** **Loth** ***of select, sharp cinnamon, two*** **Loth** ***of white, cleanly scraped ginger, one*** **Loth** ***each of common black pepper and galingale root, three*** **quintlin** ***each of cloves and nutmeg, half a*** **Loth** ***each of the noble, alien spikenard, aloeswood or wood of paradise, of mace, and of cardamom, and a*** **quintlin** ***of  select ceodary that has not been eaten by worms. Thus quince electuary  is commonly prepared in well-appointed apothecaries\u2019 shops in our time.  However, such electuary is also prepared by some in a manner that causes  it to drive out stools or acts as a laxative (treib oder laxire),  which is not usually found reported of electuaries. But in our times,  quince electuary is not only prepared as medicine for the sick, but also  as a food for the healthy to strengthen the stomach and close it after  taking (other) food. But instead of with honey, you do this with fine  white sugar thus: Take three pounds of the passed-through pulp of  quinces and two pounds of pure white clarified sugar and let it boil  gently over a slow coal fire until it detaches cleanly from the pan as  described above. You can pour such an electuary into a new box or sugar  container (zuckerl\u00e4dlin) and use it for many purposes.***\n\n***But many prepare quince electuary more artfully still,  only from the juice of quinces, and also pour it into such boxes. Do  that thus: Take eight*** **Loth** ***of  fresh quince seeds and let them soak in fresh well water for one day.  Press out the slime through a clean cloth and add to it four pounds of  the pressed juice of quinces. Or you may soften the above seeds in such a  juice or make them take effect in it, but not in a copper, iron or  brass vessel so it does not receive any flavour from that. Let it boil  well together, but not too much, so that you can still pass it through a  cloth. Take 2 pounds of the finest sugar that is well purified and  clarified to the finest. Boil it to the proper suitable thickness and  pour it into small boxes as described above. You can also prepare this  electuary that way using scummed honey instead of sugar.***\n\n***Further note here that when you wish to press the juice  out of the quinces, you must grate them on an iron grater finely all the  way to the cores and catch them in a haircloth or other linen cloth so  you can easily press them with a suitable tool or press.***\n\n***Quince electuary that is boiled to a proper and suitable  thickness can stay good for a considerable time, but it must be kept in a  temperate, airy place where it is not too hot in summer, not too cold  in winter, and otherwise neither too wet nor too dry.***\n\n***A quince electuary, especially the kind that is prepared with sugar, is an elegant and pleasing confit (Confect)  and gifted with valuable powers. For it recovers the lost desire and  appetite to eat, strengthens and furthers digestion, and has the  particular property of strengthening the stomach and the liver except in  matters that are caused by heat.***\n\n***This electuary also keeps people in good colour and  stills disgust, eructations, and unnatural vomiting of the stomach,  stops the flowing and breach of the belly and the white and the bloody  flux or bloody stool. But in this case it must be eaten before food,  because if it is taken after food, it gentles and softens the stomach,  furthers digestion and closes the stomach so no evil vapour may rise up  from it. Thus it is not improperly taken by rich people in the evening  to strengthen a dull stomach incapable of digestion.***\n\n***This electuary, prepared with Malvasier or another strong wine and spices, is served cold as a sauce (Salsen) or common dipping sauce (Eindunck) with food, especially useful and strengthening to the stomach head, and digestive powers.***\n\n***Further note that sometimes, quince electuary, and  especially the kind in which no spices are used, is mixed with a little  musk and stirred well with wine, rosewater, or pressed-out quince juice.***\n\n***Quince electuary that is prepared with wine as described  above and with spices and other hot ingredients serves old people, women  who have cooled, and every complaint of cold and moist complexion. But  if we first boil the quinces with water of the pressed juice and then  prepare the electuary with sugar, or only from quince juice and sugar,  the heat is tempered (because quinces are moved to be cold in the first  and dry in the second degree). That is why it is more useful and  suitable to those who are of a hot nature or have much gall in their  stomachs.***\n\n(p. 27 ff)\n\nFor all the pomposity, this is very useful information, technical and precise. We can basically go from clarifying the [sugar ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/30/clarifying-sugar-after-walter-ryff/)or [honey ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/04/walter-ryff-on-honey/)to  making the electuary to preparing the sauce, working with a reasonable  approximation of original proportions and techniques. Ryff even  describes an early version of the gelling test we still use on jam. This  goes well beyond the recipe in my [Landsknecht Cookbook. ](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook)\n\nWalter Ryff, a somewhat enigmatic figure, was a medical professional  and incredibly prolific author in the mid-16th century.

The intense spiciness the second  recipe would generate suggests that these sculptures were not meant to  be eaten in large bites. One would go a long way among many diners. I  imagine them being eaten at the end of the meal, when *\u00e9pices de chambre*  and other fragrant confections were customarily served. That would  allow the hedgehog to be admired for a while and conclude the occasion  in style. Add to that the poetically best-known advantage of this  creature and what is there not to like?\n\nOne of the most extensive and interesting medieval recipe  collections in German is a manuscript dated 1460 and ascribed to one  Meister Hans, cook at the Wurttemberg court. It was often treated as a  solitary, the work of a single cook, but there are too many parallels  with contemporary manuscripts from Southern Germany to make this  plausible. The recipes are an eclectic mix, many terse and simple,  others detailed and sprinkled with anecdotes.

{"title": "Another 'Knitwork' Fritter (c. 1450)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/13/another-knitwork-fritter/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/13/another-knitwork-fritter/)\n\nA recipe from the Innsbruck MS, and something interesting is going on here:\n\n***110 If you would make a string-shaped (gestriktz) fritter, make a thick strauben batter and take a small courtly serving dish (hoff sch\u00fcssel), and make a hole through and through (dar durich und dor durich).  Thus fry it, and it it starts to come together in the middle, prevent  it with a small wooden skewer, thus it will become (shaped) like a cross  etc.***\n\nThis recipe by itself is nice, but not particularly exciting.  It  sounds a lot like funnelcakes, a batter poured into hot fat to produce a  mesh of fried \u2018strings\u2019. That also fits the word used to describe it. A  *gestriktz* is a piece of ropework or stringwork. It could already mean knitwork, the thing we today associate with *stricken*, but that denotation is not yet exclusive.\n\nWhat is interesting is that we find other recipes with very similar  names dating to around the same time, but describing a very different  process. Both recipe collections in Cod Pal Germ 551 include their [own entries for *gestrickte*/*gestrick*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/19/cheese-knitwork-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-2/).

And  let it get hot and lay the logs into that. And take eggs as much as you  wish and sugar and raisins and season it well. And then draw it out no  thinner that yarn. And take it off the fire, and watch that it does not  grow too cold or it spoils.***\n\nSection B has a  close parallel:\n\n***12 A dish of a knitwork (gestrickte) of cheese you find here***\n\n***If you would make a knitwork of cheese, take a brittle/dry (******murben******)  cheese and white wheat bread and grate that together.

Then no longer move it about it  the mortar and (see) that it does not become too cold and do not  oversalt it.***\n\nIt is interesting that while the recipes are quite similar, their  spelling is different almost throughout which suggests that if one  copies the other (as the two sections generally seem to do in large  parts), it was done by dictation, not from a written copy. Obviously,  this is also a completely different and not entirely clear dish for  which, I think, cheese fritters are pulled into melted strings in hot  fat. And as if that was not enough, the same source has another two [parallel recipes for *gestrickts/gestrickten* fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/21/knitted-fritters-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/). Section A gives it as:\n\n***24 Make a dish of knitted fritters thus***\n\n***If you would make knitted fritters (gestrickts pachens) of a dough, make it as hard as (for) infidel (haydenisch) fritters and also make sheets as though for infidel fritters (heydenische pleter) and make cuts that are round*** (**sinibel** ***can  mean rounded, circular, or wavy) like a finger. Take fat in a pan or in  a mortar and set it (by the fire) that it gets hot and agitated (wellig).  Take a wooden stick or spoon and reach for the sheets with that, and  lay one each on it and then lay the other across, and throw it into the  pan on that wooden stick (use the stick to place in the fat). Let it  fry, and turn it around in the mortar. And then make a good sauce (suppen) for it with honey and good spices and add a little wine vinegar so that it \u2018bites\u2019 (pitzel) through the honey, and strew a little raisins in. And pour the sauce on the fritters and serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nSection B has:\n\n***14 A dish of knitted (?*** **gestrickten**) ***fritters***\n\n***If you would make a knitted fritter of dough, make (a dough) as hard as though for an infidel cake (heidenyschen kuchen \u2013 a common fritter) and also make sheets like the infidel sheets and cut it in slices that are rounded (? synbeller)  like fingers. Take fat into a pan or in a mortar and set it (by the  fire) so that it becomes hot. Take a wooden spoon or piece of wood to  pick up the sheets, lay them one across the other and throw them into  the pan with the wooden implement. Let them fry and turn them over in  the mortar. Make a good sauce (supen) to go with them of honey and good spices and add a little wine and a little vinegar so that it is tasted (piczell) through the honey. Strew a little raisins on them and pour the sauce over the fritters. Then serve it and do not oversalt it.***\n\nHere, the knitwork appears to be make by interlacing long, conical  pieces of a thin, firm dough before immersing them in hot fat.\n\nI have not yet tried any of these recipes, though I hope to  experiment with all three at some point in winter. What they clearly  illustrate is that in the German tradition, names of dishes are a very  changeable and unreliable indicator of their nature. They are typically  descriptive and often not limited to a single dish. We should not rely  on them to reconstruct menus or food habits unless we have corroborating  evidence.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna.

This is despite the fact that almonds were very hard to grow  in a Central European climate and mostly had to be imported from the  Mediterranean at great expense. Hemp thrives in Germany and was  cultivated widely, but it is rare for a recipe collection to mention it  more than in passing. That is what makes these recipes so interesting. \n\nIn technical terms, there is nothing surprising here. You can make  butter, curds, and cheese out of almond milk and though the latter was  usually faked by thickening or gelling agents, there are descriptions of  this in the sources. The fascinating part is that we have, assembled in  one place, an alternative to the luxury option in all its versatility.  Hemp seeds (or possibly entire seed pods) ground up with a liquid and  strained will produce a milky emulsion just as almonds will. [Hemp milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp_milk)  is still in use, and regaining popularity. It could be used to make  curds that were then eaten fresh, with honey and spices, or pressed into  a cheese that could then be sliced and eaten or used in other dishes.  The suggestion of serving it in a *ziseindel* sauce \u2013 a combination of fruit and spices \u2013 vaguely recalls paneer masala, \n\nIt probably should be said here that the hemp referenced is European *Cannabis sativa* which  produces very little THC and even if eaten in large quantities will not  produce an appreciable psychoactive effect. Until the first half of the  twentieth century, hempseed and hempseed oil were commonplace food  items in Central Europe, though they were regarded as uncouth. Hemp was  grown mainly for its fibres used to make rope and cloth. The seeds were a  byproduct and usually eaten by those who could not afford more highly  regarded oils. As the twentieth century progressed, hemp cultivation  receded and the seeds increasingly became used as animal feed rather  than human food. However, there are some [traditional recipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemieniotka)  that still use them. I will point out, in case this needs saying, that  making milk or cheese with psychoactive cannabis oil is not recommended  for a variety of reasons even where this would be legal. \n\nAn interesting point in recipe #84 is the mention of eating *smaltz* on  Saturdays. In contemporary German, the words schmalz is not yet limited  to rendered animal fat, but it does refer to melted and solidified  animal or dairy fats in contrast to liquid vegetable oils. The author  clearly envisions that some people will eat this on a Saturday (a  meatless day in the stricter Christian tradition of the time) while  others do not. I am not sure whether this refers to individual piety or  regional distinctions in church jurisdictions, but it casts an  interesting light on the way fasting practices could differ.  \n\nI have very little experience with non-dairy milks or with cheesemaking, but this may be worth trying out. \n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes.

It combines the culinary  delights of the season \u2013 fresh  cheese, eggs, and unpreserved May butter. I am not entirely sure how to  interpret the intendecd outcome, but it may be meant as a kind of cheesy  omelet, stirred until it is smooth and just barely cooked. I do not  think the pieces of \u2018flowing\u2019 (i.e. fresh, not aged) cheese are meant to  stay intact. As to why it is called a *gespot* or *gespott*,  I have no idea. The word can mean a mockery, but that need not be the  origin of the name.

Using smail or frog meat in dumplings and as a filling for poultry does  not strike me as terribly improbable, but it implies a lot of it being  on hand. Perhaps such dishes generated large amounts of leftovers? That  might explain why the author thinks it a good idea to deceive diners  into eating them. Going by what we know of entertainment in  sixteenth-century Germany, though, this might have passed for humour. \n\nFranz de Rontzier, head cook to the bishop of Halberstadt and duke of Braunschweig, published his encyclopaedic *Kunstbuch von mancherley Essen* in 1598. He clearly looks to Marx Rumpolt\u2019s *New Kochbuch*  as the new gold standard, but fails to match it in engaging style or  depth. He is thus overshadowed by the twin peaks of Marx Rumpolt and  Anna Wecker. What makes his work interesting is the way in which he  systematically lists versions of a class of dishes, illustrating the  breadth or a court cook\u2019s repertoire. He is also more modernly  fashionable than Rumpolt.

{"title": "Hei\u00dfwecken - North German Carnival Buns and Deep Time", "selftext": " Today, I found a baker that still sells  what used to be a universal specialty across the Low German-speaking world \u2013 [Hei\u00dfwecken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hei%C3%9Fwecke).  As early as the fifteenth century, we can trace the  history of this  confection, always eaten around Carnival. Today, the word refers to a  sweet, rich bun very close to a Franzbr\u00f6tchen in consistency, topped  with sugar and optionally filled with cream.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hei\u00dfwecke as of 2023](https://preview.redd.it/y0qfmdc2slja1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8473d35755d4251e63301b95afd26951735beb8)\n\n In 1996, Ernst Helmut Segschneider published the essay *Hei\u00dfwecken als Fastnachtsgeb\u00e4ck im Hanseraum* in G\u00fcnther Wiegelmann\u2019s book Nahrung und Tischkultur im Hanseraum. in it, he traced the history of *Hei\u00dfwecken* from the earliest mentions of *hete wegghe*  in the Hamburg hospital accounts of 1447 and 1457. Later sources  provide descriptions of the dish: \u201cwarm, white bread which is kneaded  with melted  butter or boiled milk and with which the stomach is filled  according to ancient, uncouth habit\u201d (Idioticon Hamburgense, 1755). The [wikipedia  article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hei%C3%9Fwecke) on this food is largely based on this essay, and it is remarkably detailed and well sourced for a food entry as a result.  \n\n[semla, courtesy of wikimedia commons](https://preview.redd.it/en44bkj6slja1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3089bf2a36e4bd2226265d05257db52e0296f7c4)\n\n Segschneider argues that the Hanseatic *hete wegghe* is the origin of the Scandinavian tradition of [*semla*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semla),  the sweet, cream-filled bun that occurs across the north under a  variety of names. Indeed, one of the earliest Swedish names for this is  hetv\u00e4gg, clearly *hete wegghe* \u2013 *Hei\u00dfwecken*. Swedish later adopted the High German term *Semmel* in place of the dialectal *Weck(e)*,  but the two terms were and still are synonymous. Today, both refer to  fine, white breadrolls eaten for breakfast. Interestingly, while the  tradition of *semla* is thriving across all of Scandinavia and the Baltic countries, *Hei\u00dfwecken*, once ubiquitous across northern Germany, have all but disappeared. The dominant baked good for Carnival is now the *Fastnachtskrapfen*, a *Berliner*. Only very traditional bakeries still produce them at all, and I had to check four shops before I found one.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A dense, soft crumb with raisins hiding inside and buttery sugar crunch on top](https://preview.redd.it/hbhrkik4slja1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b57850e70685979dde3c908bd6bc1b2f94578350)\n\n However, the meticulously researched narrative developed by  Segschneider looks in one direction only, and thast leaves open some  interesting aspects of the *Hei\u00dfwecke* phenomenon. There is no  reason to think the idea started in the Low German-speaking region of  Northwestern Germany to spread across the Baltic. The idea seems to  obvious to be a one-time invention. And indeed, the humorous songs of  the fourteenth-century poet [K\u00f6nig vom Odenwald](https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz72831.html) mention the culinary delights of a *begozzen semmel*  \u2013 a semmel that has something poured on it. Regrettably, we do not know  what, but both milk and butter surely make sense. It is very unlikely  this merely refers to bread soaked in some cooking liquid because the  name for that kind of dish \u2013 *Suppe* \u2013 was already current and  the dish was too common to warrant extolling in song. As an aside, one  of our sources for the works of the food-minded singer is the [Hausbuch of protonotary Michael de Leone](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausbuch_des_Michael_de_Leone), the same man to whose personal library we owe the earliest version of the [buoch von guoter spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (an [English translation](http://www.medievalcookery.com/etexts/buch.html) of which exists). Culinary history is rich in unexpected connections like this.   \n\nOf course this is a speculative leap of faith. However, it is not  improbable at all. German culinary naming conventions in the middle ages  are almost nonexistent, so absent an actual recipe, we will find it  hard to decide what exactly *begozzen semmel* meant \u2013 or for that matter what exactly the *hete wegghe*  that were served in 1447 looked like. But to illustrate both the folly  of attaching too much importance to a name and the perils of postulating  the origin of any dish, let alone doing so on a monolingual research  basis, we need look no farther that England. To be precise, the  fifteenth-century Harleian MSS [279 ](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/CookBk/1:6.4?rgn=div2;sort=occur;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=rastons)and [4016](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/CookBk/1:7.3?rgn=div2;sort=occur;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=rastons#hl1).  Here, we  find a recipe for [rastons](http://www.medievalcookery.com/search/display.html?twofi:242:BTR):\n\n***Rastons. Take fyne floure, and white of eyren, and a  litul of the yolkes; And then take warme berm, and put al thes togidre,  and bete hem togidre with thi honde so longe til hit be short and thik  ynogh.

If a beer keeps its  foam long, it is taken for a good beer. But beers have two kinds of foam  (*****Gescht oder Schaum*****).***\n\n***(marginalia: Beer has two kinds of foam (Gescht oder Schaum))***\n\n***One derives from an internal cause when the beer is first  brewed and foams and ferments strongly, and this is, as it were, the  flower of the beer. It is thin, uneven, solid, and floats on the top of  the beer, and when the beer has finished fermenting, it becomes thick  and gradually sinks to the bottom.***\n\n***The other kind derives from an external cause, that is  from shaking or pouring, and it goes away and eventually disappears.  Barley beers have copious, but thin foam, wheaten ones have less,  thicker, whitish, and it barely covers the surface of the beer in the  pitcher.***\n\n***The yeast or barm (*****Hefen oder Bermen*****) are a  thick, earthy and heavy matter that sinks down in the beer and settles  at the bottom of the cask, and it is warm and dry by nature, and  bloating, as we see from the beers that cause belching (*****auffstossend machen*****) and the doughs that it causes to rise and blows up (*****gehend machen und auffblasen*****).***\n\n***From these, a good husbandman customarily makes a good brandy or aqua vitae (*****Brandtenwein oder Aquam vitae*****) for his household so he needs not seek out or buy it elsewhere.***\n\n***(marginalia: Yeast, what use it is)***\n\n***The yeast that is left over after this when the brandy  has been drawn off are good to maintain his livestock and especially the  pigs that thrive on it mightily well, grow and fatten, which is why  some people derive their income and maintenance specifically from brandy  and pigs.***\n\nThis is an interesting text for several reasons: Firstly, because it  states clearly that beer yeast was used as a leavening in the context of  private households. Second, because it gives us an idea of what beers  were expected to look like. Such visual cues are uncommon, and they can  help us understand what to aim for in reconstructing foodstuffs. Third,  it gives us an insight into the frugal resource management expected of  even wealthy households. Beer would be brewed in the home, the barm  distilled to produce liquor, and the residue fed to pigs. Very little  would go to waste here.\n\nJohann Coler\u2019s *Oeconomia ruralis et domestica* was a popular  book on the topic of managing a wealthy household. It is based largely  on previous writings by Coler and first appeared between 1596 and 1601.  Repeatedly reprinted for decades, it became one of the most influential  early works of *Hausv\u00e4terliteratur*.

The barm is actually settled yeast  (after fermentation is complete) in a sort of hibernation. You wouldn't distill barm but the alcohol it produced. You could re pitch the barm to wake it up to make beer or use it to make bread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's my understanding"]}

{"title": "A Medieval Recipe for Fritters (maybe) in a Sauce", "selftext": " [https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/30/fritters-maybe-in-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/30/fritters-maybe-in-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/)\n\nHere is the recipe I referred to [the day before yesterday](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/28/meatballs-from-cgm-384-ii/): \n\n***65 Fritters (*****bachen*****) in a sauce (or bowl?*** **Jussel*****)***\n\n***For fritters in a*** **Jussel** ***(sauce), take grated  cheese and flour, break eggs into it, and season it well. Knead it  together and roll it out on a board and make long, thin strips of it and  fry them in fat. After that, cut them into a sauce (or bowl?*** **Jussel*****).***\n\nThe fritters here are a basic, but very attractive part of medieval  cuisine. I have made variations of them numerous times, and they are  always popular: Versatile, low-threshold, child-friedly historic dining.  If you uise a mild cheese, they combine with sweet and fruit-based  sauces to gently guide the hesitant towards the popular combinations of  sweet and savoury in medieval cooking. Served as a side dish, they can  allow for a riskier meat because any picky eaters can have their fill of  them. I love my \u2018medieval cheese straws\u2019. \n\nWhat makes this recipe interesting is its reference \u2013 the second time in this collection \u2013 to *Iussel*.  the word is consistely capitalised and looks temptingly like a  reference to a sauce, one that was in some way felt to be foreign, with  the word either taken from the [Middle Latin](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/16/how-to-cook-eggs-in-norman-sicily/) [*iusculum* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/17/cooking-meat-the-salernitan-way/)or  from possibly French. There is no indication what kind of sauce this  was, but clearly it was unlike the ones described with the familiar  terms *pfeffer* and *galray*. One might speculate that  they were vinegar- or onion-based. However, there is at the very least a  possibility that this interpretation is completely off. A parallel  recipe in the [Inntalkochbuch ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Inntalkochbuch.pdf)has:\n\n***7*** **Zu ainem pachen in ainer sch\u00fcssel**  \n***For a fritter (served) in a bowl***  \n***Take  grated cheese and flour in equal amounts, break eggs into it and season  it well, knead it together and roll it out on a board. Make the dough  into strips (*****struczel*****), fry them in a pan in fat and then cut them in(to?) a bowl.***\n\n*Iussel* has become *sch\u00fcssel*, a simple serving bowl. I  contend that the latter is the misreading, a later generation of cooks  no longer understanding a technical term. The Inntalkochbuch is about  150 years later than Cgm 384. However, it is also possible that the  error is in Cgm 384 and the quest for the elusive *iusculum* a wild goose chase. \n\nBound together with medicinal, veterinary, and magical texts, the  culinary recipes of Munich Cgm 384 were partly published in 1865 as \u201cEin  alemannisches B\u00fcchlein von guter Speise\u201c.

{"title": "How come people were willing to kill each other in the past over delicious foods? Even as far as mere condiments like food spices? Was food that terrible back than?", "selftext": "I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken, and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living. The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......\n\nA bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.\n\nIn addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which \"Ninja Chefs\" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. \n\nThe project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.\n\nThese two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.\n\nThe first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. \n\nAnd what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.\n\nHell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!\n\nIn addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:\n\n\"Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death\".\n\nHe explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.\n\nHell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.\n\nI am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?\n\nCan anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!\n\nWhat is the logic behind this?

{"title": "A Bustard's Neck, Stuffed (15th c.)", "selftext": "Another short but interesting recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n[Not  a fifteenth century source, but a bustard](https://preview.redd.it/wo4h9vqqltxe1.jpg?width=1535&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16222ef3c05be909f2ab74d17939707518dc632c)\n\n***243 Of a bustard\u2019s neck***\n\n***Fill the neck of a bustard or another bird this way: Take pork, hard-boiled eggs, sage, and herbs (kraut). Chop all of it together, fill the neck with that, and boil it. When it is boiled, lay it on a griddle while it is hot. Brush it with eggs or with an egg batter. Drizzle it with fat and with saffron and parsley and millet (?phenich). Grind that to a sauce (condiment) as best you can and serve it.***\n\nMany birds that people ate had long, flexible necks and cooks got creative in using them separately. This is one example of that: the neck of a bustard (Otis tarda) is stuffed with a herbed pork filling, roasted separately from the bird, and served as a dish in its own right. It is not quite clear what the baste consists of. Fat, saffron and parsley make sense as a yellow-green, flavourful liquid that would also stop the skin from drying out. The egg or egg batter would coat it from the outside, perhaps creating a crisp shell. The addition of *phenich* is a bit puzzling. As written, this could mean Italian millet (panicum). It is not easy to see how that would be included in the baste \u2013 as flour, cooked, or and entire grains? As ever, we cannot exclude the possibility of a scribal error. Perhaps, the solution is as easy as *hoenich* (honey). Still, it sounds like a fun idea to play with.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/29/a-stuffed-bustard-neck/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/29/a-stuffed-bustard-neck/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1kavrdu/a_bustards_neck_stuffed_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1745952725.0, "score": 3, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1kavrdu/a_bustards_neck_stuffed_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Do not attempt with an actual bustard, the Great Bustard of Europe is now critically endangered.\n\nPossibly because they taste good."]}

They may not be mainstream and indeed these countries have a tradition of taboo dog meat because the populace sees dog as disgusting to cook and eat, but somehow subcultures and regions even in these countries have it thriving enough to at least have a big feast and some small places in these countries' outskirt may even eat dog daily (despite the main nations' culture being anti-dog meat).\n\nConsidering all of Japan's nearby neighbor across the East Asian stratosphere still have restaurants that openly sell cook dog without facing controversy, how come Japan never went this path? I mean I wouldn't be surprised if there are Yakuza and other criminal groups who engage in a black market dog trade with something like a small isolated mountain community of less than 100 does eat dog and maybe a household in the forest regions eat dog secretly........ But an entire subculture or even regions of over 200+ people (often reaching thousands as Indonesia and Philippines) people eating it for a yearly delicacy? I haven't heard anything like this in Japan.\n\nIndeed even before modernization, as early as Imperial Japan doesn't seem to have this dish in contrast to Korea, China, and the rest of East Asia. Even culinary documentaries I watched on Asia don't mention dog being delicacy in Japan while they frequently highlight dog on menu in China and Korea and local holidays eating dog meat, etc.\n\nWhy is this? Why didn't Japan go the way of its neighbors esp with China influencing all across Asia up until the Indian and Afghani/Iranian borders?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ggndfc/why_doesnt_japan_have_a_tradition_of_dog_meat_and/", "created_utc": 1730404315.0, "score": 3, "author": "LouvrePigeon", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1ggndfc/why_doesnt_japan_have_a_tradition_of_dog_meat_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Eating any 4-legged animal was officially banned until the Meiji Revolution towards the end of the 19th century.

Boil them in good white wine, and when it is skimmed and properly salted, crumble in rye bread (the crumbs being) the size of rice. Colour it yellow, add sugar, ginger, and pepper until you think it is right, and let it boil well. When you serve it, sprinkle (or stick?) it with cinnamon and cloves.***\n\nAs a recipe, this is not unusual. Fish cooked in wine and served in a bread-thickened sauce with plenty of expensive spices is fairly standard. One interesting point, though, is the observation that the bread is to be crumbled \u201cthe size of rice\u201d. I assume that describes the individual crumbs being the size of rice grains (most likely round grain rice, at that time), not resemble rice flour or cooked rice. That suggests that, though made of rye, the bread used is neither coarse nor heavy.\n\nAn open question is how to read the instruction to *se* (literally to sow, usually meaning to sprinkle) cloves and cinnamon on the fish before serving. I could imagine this meaning a sprinkling of powdered spices, but both cloves and cinnamon are well suited to sticking them into the pieces. That may actually be what is meant here.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Pike, boiled (or more likely simmered \u2013 the culinary vocabulary of the time is not very granular) in wine and vinegar, is served with lemons, spices, and sugar. The main difference between the two versions is that in one case, the seasoning is added to the original cooking liquid while in the other, the fish is transferred to a separately prepared cooking sauce. Both approaches are common. We do not know how much sugar would be added, but I can certainly imagine this as a sweet-sour dish.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Put it into a bowl and set it in a cellar on the ground until you want to eat it.***\n\nThis is quite similar to the [cold mus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/08/28/cold-mus/) we had a week ago \u2013 so similar one wonders why it merited a separate recipe, really. It is interesting for mainly two reasons. First, the step of passing the finished dish through a sieve to make it smooth. This makes sense, especially if the egg curdled during cooking as it easily will. I would not be surprised if this was a good deal more commonly done with egg-based Mus dishes than the recipes record. The second is that we are getting a hint at portion sizes. Twelve egg whites make a dish for \u2018one table\u2019, that is, the entire company dining. We do not know how large that group was, but all illustrations and descriptions suggest a \u2018table\u2019 was a practical size for keeping company, anything between six and ten people. This is a dainty dish, not something to gorge on.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

From the recipe collection of Philippine Welser:\n\n[Grinding almonds](https://preview.redd.it/81ozxg2papdd1.jpg?width=567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e6bd904b4af7632389d60868e336cb073ada44c)\n\n***127 To bake pretty stritzela of almonds***\n\n***Take a vierdung of almonds to make about 12 stritzla. Let them lie overnight in fresh water, then blanch (shelsch) them and grind them as for marzipan. Do not add quite as much sugar as there is almonds. Grind it with rosewater thickly as possible (aufs dikest for aufs driknes). Then make schrytzala, as long as you want them. Then prepare a dough; take good flour, the best kind, and add sugar and rosewater and a little freshly melted fat, and prepare the dough. Roll out sheets (bledla) as thinly as possible and wrap the abovementioned stritzala in it. Wet them a little with rosewater along the place where you cut the dough apart, and roll it out thin, that way it is right. Take an iron and cut (zwick) them out as nicely as possible, as you want them (any shape you want them?). Then take the sheet from the tart pan, and sprinkle it with sugar. Lay out the strytzalin on it and bake it quickly. Give it little heat from below and very much from above. You cannot take too much here. Let them bake for about a quarter of an hour, then check. If they are broken open at the top (oben aufkloben send), they are done properly. Cover them again.***\n\nWhen we find small, delicate sweets in Renaissance recipe collections from Germany, they are typically fritters or sometimes made from marzipan. There are a few recipes, though, that foreshadow the modern boom in *Pl\u00e4tzchen*, the variously flavoured, bite-sized baked sweets that especially South Germany and Austria are famous for. This is such a recipe. It is oddly placed, between sweet and savoury fritters, and its orthography is creative even by sixteenth-century standards. Note the variety in the recurring name \u2013 stritzela, schritzla, schrytzala, strytzalin. It is, however, clear, detailed, and unusually easy to fully reconstruct. In short, it is the kind of recipe historic cooking aficionados love and our audience will actually eat.\n\nRegarding the *stritzela* itself: A *Striezel* is a long, thin thing, and *stritzela* is the diminutive of it. The name is used for a variety of baked goods today, including a type of *Stollen,* but here it just refers to the shape. The finished product is long, thin, and small. Given the quantity of almonds that goes in \u2013 a *vierdung* is a quarter of a pound, so around 100-120 grammes \u2013 they are not insubstantial, but definitely no cakes for sharing. If we assume that 110 grammes of almonds are ground with not quite the same quantity of sugar, making twelve pieces from the mass gives us at best 20 grammes apiece even if the almonds draw water while soaking. That is larger than the usual modern marzipan serving, but not by much.\n\nThe dough that they are wrapped in is quite interesting. Normally, these \u2018sheets\u2019 are described in very general terms, and they are rarely anything like modern cookie doughs. If you are going to boil or fry it, a plain water or egg paste actually makes more sense, too. It holds together in water and if immersed in hot fat, it will draw in some of it to become \u2018short\u2019, that is crumbly rather than stiff. Baking these pastries, however, rarely gives good results, which is why modern pastries and cookies always include some fat. As does this recipe.\n\nAdmittedly, we do not have quantities, but the mixture of flour, sugar, rosewater, and melted fat makes a plausible \u2018short\u2019 crust. I assume it is light on the fat, with a view to rolling it out easily. As to the final shape, I doubt these are m,eatn to be paper-thin like some Middle eastern confection. Rather, the description of cutting (the word *zwick* has overtones of pinching, as with pliers) looks like the ravioli method, with fillings arranged between layers of dough and cut apart.\n\nI admit I am unsure which \u2018sheet\u2019 is taken from the tart pan. This may be a reference to a dough base that is used to prevent them from sticking and burning, or some kind of cover \u2013 maybe paper \u2013 used for the purpose. We know from later recipes that greased paper was used in ovens. What is clear, though, is that the *stritzela* are baked. A tart pan worked like a Dutch oven, standing in the embers with coals heaped on its lid to bake whatever was inside it. Here, the heat is supposed to come mainly from the top, and the expectation is that the finished pieces break open. Whether this is just the fine craquelure of fully baked short pastry or an actual breach with almond filling escaping is not sure \u2013 I have had both happen.\n\nIn sum, then, we have roughly the following:\n\nIngredients for the filling: 120g almonds, 100g sugar, 1-2 tsp rosewater. For the dough: 200g flour, 50g sugar, 1/2 cup butter, more rosewater and sugar.\n\nWe blanch the almonds and process them with the sugar to a fine paste, adding rosewater gradually as needed. Then we mix the flour and sugar and add the melted butter and enough rosewater to make a stiff dough. We roll out the dough, arrange twelve pieces of almond mass on one half of it, fold over the other half, and cut them apart. I would use a pastry wheel and pinch the edges shut. Finally, we sprinkle the pastries with sugar (I would brush them with rosewater or perhaps even with egg beforehand) and bake them at a strong top heat. I would not go above 180\u00b0C, but place them high in the oven or turn on the broiling function. The result is marzipan cookies \u2013 uncommon enough, with their rosewater note and crunchy crust, to attract notice, but unthreateningly familiar and welcome. A good first bite on the route to more adventurous historic eating.\n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty of her day.

Nonetheless, it is more comprehensive than the one  we know from the court of Hessen-Kassel in the 1590s (see [Bach 2016](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1442251271?coliid=I3BB2VAX5J4NDP&colid=3BWE77NEDPH7C&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=armypatti0a-20&linkId=147f5c0734d4658fce083f503925753f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl),  p. 79). This was a versatile kitchen demanding of its staff\u2019s skills. A  vegetarian diet, or as  contemporaries would have called it, Lenten  food did not have to be deprived if you had  enough money. To the  extremely wealthy house of Tegernsee, that would not have been an issue.  \n\nThe first part of the list makes reference to soups, a topic treated in greater detail in the [instructions for provisions issued](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/05/soups-from-the-tegernsee-list/)  for each kind. The two lists do not match exactly, but the only soup  from the provisions list not included here is the crawfish soup. There  are several soups mentioned here and in the calendar that are not in the  provisions list, though. With entries like water soup (likely a  vegetable broth served over bread), fat soup, and curd cheese soup that  is because no ingredients for these were drawn from stores. In other  cases, the reason is less clear. \n\nMost soups are readily identifiable by their primary ingredient, so  we have a rough idea of what they were like. Some names are not entirely  transparent, though. We have seen that *haubet* soup depended on a specific manner of cutting the bread served in it. It is also called *zisindel* soup  here which indicates that the fruit sauce of that name played a role,  likely dabbed on the bread in the soup bowl as a relish. There is also *hadersuppen*, which may be a soup with egg or pieces of pancake served in it. *Hader* is a word for rag, and such pieces might have recalled the appearance. *Stabsuppen* is less clear to me, so I will hope to stumble over a recipe at some point. Finally, while [*kitlfleck* ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/09/the-ancestry-of-kuttelfleck/)clearly would translate as tripe, it can\u2019t really mean that. Benedictines did not eat meat, at least not overtly. \n\nNext, there is *Mus*, a term that includes anything soft enough to eat with a spoon, but not liquid enough to be a soup. Again, there is a [parallel list of provisions to be issued](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/08/mus-dishes-from-the-tegernsee-list/)  for the various types, and the overlap is considerable. A few dishes  listed here are not found there, and in some cases their identity is not  clear. The two mentions of *prein* or *preyn* Mus are odd  because they seem repetitive and because they seem to just mean  \u201cporridge Mus\u201d. There probably was something specific to its consistency  or preparation. The chopped and cut Mus may be references to a [kind of pasta dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/23/shaggy-mus-milk-pasta/) that was variously prepared from torn pieces of fresh dough or from cut or chopped noodles. *Krafft Mus* is interesting for using starch. I have not found many other references for this. Finally the *gsellenbrot* may well be the kind of bread porridge you would prepare from hard bread and hot broth, a common dish that a poor *Geselle* (journeyman) might well eat at the table of a tight-fisted master. \n\nKraut is an interesting section without any parallel in the other  part. Kraut was a catchall term for all kinds of leafy greens, and the  way several entrries just refer to the way this is prepared \u2013 chopped,  torn, split, or pureed \u2013 suggests that cabbage, and specifically head  cabbage, was the most common kind. That is what you would expect at the  time. I do not know what exactly set apart some named plants \u2013 Bavarian *kraut*, *kabassen*, or *scherubenkraut* \u2013  but I suspect they were variants of cabbage or beet greens. Pie\u00dfen is a  bit unclear; The word usually refers to chard, but the way it is linked  with nettles and salad (most likely meaning lettuce, the primary salad  herb) here suggests it may refer to a dish made of these plants. \n\nNext we have a fairly comprehensive list of fish, distinguished by  their method of preparation and their species. Fish was a luxurious dish  that the monks obviously enjoyed greatly. The kitchen prepared not just  locally caught freshwater fish, but also imported [stockfish ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/18/stockfish-from-meister-eberhard/)\u2013 [dried ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/27/roast-battered-stockfish/)[Atlantic ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/08/stockfish-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)[cod](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/13/stockfish-from-the-oeconomia/) \u2013 herring, and [dried ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/11/preparing-dried-fish-after-the-oeconomia/)[flatfish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/02/rumpolt-on-cooking-plateissen/). The distinction between *salm* and *laxen* (salmon) and *huechen* and *hausen* (sturgeon) also likely refers to fresh-caught regional fish versus the preserved imported kind. \n\nThe list of fried foods has a [parallel in the provisions section](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/15/fritters-from-the-tegernsee-list/)  again. The overlap is considerable and I explored most names and linked  them to recipes in the discussion of that. What I am not clear on is  the *maulbers* (mulberries) and the *smolznudl*. Today, *Schmalznudel* refers to a kind of leavened fritter, but it is not clear what, if anything, distinguished them from *strauben* here.\n\nFinally, there is a list of miscellaneous dishes \u2013 various kinds of  cooked fruit, legumes, dairy, and others \u2013 that accompany ritters as the  final course. They are not dessert food in the modern sense, that habit  only develops in the course of the sixteenth century. Again, we find  some of them in the [dairy and egg dishes in the provisions list](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/04/dairy-dishes-a-new-and-interesting-source/).  Aside from some potentially interesting dishes \u2013 what are those black  dumplings made with if not blood? \u2013 we  have two named dishes, *rutschart* and *vitztumb*. Both likely refer to a kind of thick soup, but I have not found contemporary recipes for either. \n\nAltogether, the range of dishes is notable. Clearly, this monastic  community enjoyed variety and was not willing to let expense or  considerations of asceticism get in the way of a good meal. \n\nThe recipe collection from the monastery at Tegernsee (Bavaria) is an  unusual source. It seems to have been produced to serve very specific  practical purposes in the administration of that particular monastery,  giving quantities for dishes and instructing the reader on which days  what is to be served. A calendar and a short treatise on fishes are  written in the same manuscript, the whole produced around 1500 and in  use until at least 1534.

It  is likely, in some cases certain, that other ingredients were involved.  However, the quantities and relations can tell us some things about how  these dishes were prepared. Let us look at a few here:\n\nRice is cooked to a porridge, a universal practice in Germany then.  The idea of having individual grains as we do today was seen as[ a foreign, specifically Ottoman, habit](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/29/turkish-recipes-in-rumpolt-1581/). The almonds are most likely intended to [prepare almond milk](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/01/04/dairy-dishes-a-new-and-interesting-source/) which is added to the pre-cooked rice for a final round of boiling. This is a luxurious dish.\n\nThe second recipe for a puree of dried figs is equally lavish, a  massive expenditure on imported dried fruit \u2013 figs do not grow well in  Austria. Interestingly, along with the  cooked fruit, there is an  allocation of six whole fruit for each portion. These were most likely  cooked individually, as we find it done in [other recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/24/figs-in-galantine/).  Note that the actual dish most likely was closer to a bread porridge  flavoured with figs rather than a fig puree thickened with bread.  Prepared with wine and spices, it must have been rich and intense. The  black cherry Mus, too, most liukelyy functioned this way and I suspect  it was prepared with dried cherries that would give it a dark colour.\n\nThe varieties of serving stockfish are interesting. The yellow *s\u00fcpplin* is found in [other sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/18/stockfish-from-meister-eberhard/),  a sauce coloured with saffron, but the addition of apples is  interesting here. The other recipe calls for a pfeffer sauce, a spicy,  thick sauce, or a black one. The latter probably is a variety of  bread-thickened sauce made with darkly toasted bread. Black sauces can  also be bound with blood, but that is not likely in a Benedictine house  where meat was served only to the sick.\n\nThe apple and pear Mus, too, are [fairly common](https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/beloved-of-kings-and-kindergartners/) across Europe. We find a wide [variety of recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/05/apple-and-pear-purees-from-the-innsbruck-ms/),  some seemingly meant for dried fruit. Here, I suspect the pear puree is  meant to be prepared from dried pears. With the apples, I am not sure.  The dish itself was quite humble, but the version prepared here likely  was ennobled by other ingredients and elaborate preparation. Note that  apple puree is not necessarily a sweet dish. The same goes for the apple  sauce, the *\u00f6pfelziseindel*. These types of sauce were made from  apples and/or onions and usually highly spiced. I included a modern  redaction for the apple version in my [Landsknecht Cookbook](https://zauberfeder-shop.de/Landsknecht-Cookbook).\n\nThe various preparations of  barley are interesting. This seems to be  a regional habit, as we rarely find barley recipes feature prominently  in recipe collections. There is not much I can say about them \u2013 I  suspect that the cracked barley is prepoared like rice, cooked to a  porridge with almond milk, while the barley served in clear broth would  look more like a soup with whole grains in it. The recipe name *rutschhart* actually is the first recorded mention of [*Ritschert* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritschert)which  described a rich, meaty barley stew traditionally served in the eastern  Alpine areas of Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia.\n\nPeas, too, are a common dish prepared in many ways, usually mashed, and [especially Bohemian peas are found in other sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/29/all-about-peas-part-one/). the dish seems to have been quite popular.\n\nThe [tart cherry sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/cherry-sauce-and-trysenet-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) is one of the [most common](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/27/a-cherry-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/) [condiments ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/22/cherry-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)in our [recipe corpus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/06/cherry-sauce-from-section-two-of-cod-pal-germ-551/).  It was prepared by cooking down cherries with honey and spices, often  including bread or gingerbread for thickening, and reduced to a paste.  This was then reconstituted to a liquid when required at the table. The  list here refers to the paste \u2013 the electuary \u2013 issued from stores to be  dissolved in wine.\n\nThe recipe collection from the monastery at Tegernsee (Bavaria) is an  unusual source. It seems to have been produced to serve very specific  practical purposes in the administration of that particular monastery,  giving quantities for dishes and instructing the reader on which days  what is to be served. A calendar and a short treatise on fishes are  written in the same manuscript, the whole produced around 1500 and in  use until at least 1534.

I have no idea how  this would turn out, but I think I would like to try it at some point.  \n\n \n\n[ Slaughtering sheep, image  courtesy of wikimedia commons ](https://preview.redd.it/9j1uaxyomc2c1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d8cb163c4319167711819d65e9f1fa61fd32115)\n\n**130 Dumplings of tripe (kutteln)**\n\n**Item dumplings of tripe.

And shape balls like  eggs and cook (bach) them in the soup (cooking liquid) in a vessel (kar), and as they harden, coat (read walg for erwell) them in egg dough. Stick them on a spit and roast them**.\n\nTripe (kutteln) probably was a much more common food than recipe collections would suggest. we have [a few](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/09/the-ancestry-of-kuttelfleck/) [artful ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/02/an-odd-galantine-recipe/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/12/tripe-from-the-mondseer-kochbuch/)for  it, and this is another one. On the whole, the process is fairly clear:  the tripe is boiled, chopped together with other ingredients, and  shaped into meatballs. These are them parboiled and spit-roasted while  coated in an outer layer of dough. The vocabulary is odd in a few  places, such as when it instructs us to *bach* the meatballs in the *suppe*.  The verb usually refers to frying or baking, but here it clearly means  boiling in a cooking liquid, probably that the tripe was cooked in. Then  the instruction to *erwell* \u2013 literally boil up \u2013 the meatbally in a *teig*. I agree with Aichholzer that this is best explained as a misreading. The most likely explanation, w*alg*, roll or wrap, suggests that the *teig* was  firm and stiff. I would have expected a  liquid batter for basting  here, and perhaps that is what was originally meant.  But all of this is  just minor variations on a potentially interesting and maybe tasty meat  dish. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements. It is edited  in Doris Aichholzer\u2019s \u201cWildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201d Drei  mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Edition, \u00dcbersetzung, Quellenkommentar,  Peter Lang, Berne et al. 1999", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/18307l0/roasted_sheep_tripe_dumplings_c_1440/", "created_utc": 1700854868.0, "score": 3, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/18307l0/roasted_sheep_tripe_dumplings_c_1440/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}
{"title": "Jelly by (yet) another name (c. 1440)", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/08/jelly-by-yet-another-name/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/08/jelly-by-yet-another-name/)\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch has another recipe for meat in jelly. It is unremarkable except for the name:\n\n***123 A gelled broth of calves\u2019 feet and udder***\n\n***(marginalia:*** **Galentein**)\n\n***If you want to prepare a good gelled broth for one dish  or two of calves\u2019 feet or udder, take ten calves\u2019 feet and an entire cow  udder. Boil the udder and cut it into fine slices that are neither too  large nor too small. Roast it on a griddle and drizzle it with vinegar  and with honey. When these are roasted, distribute them in two serving  bowls. When the calves\u2019 feet are boiled, pound them well and pass them  through with vinegar and half a courtly serving dish (hof schissel) full of the broth, a*** **viertail** ***(quarter) of vinegar and half a*** **fierttal kanel** ***(quarter of a*** **kanne**)  ***of honey. Pass it through with that and throw in a lot of whole cloves  and very finely pounded ginger and as much ground pepper as you can hold  with three fingers, a little saffron, and a very small amount of salt.  Raise it over the fire and let it boil up like an egg sauce, and pour it  over the udder. This is called*** **kalendin** ***and*** **Galentin**.\n\nI have [written elsewhere](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/08/medieval-gelatin-powder-and-the-next-book-project/) about the difficulties we have interpreting words like *galrey* and *sulz*,  and that though they could clearly mean a jelly, they did not always do  so. Here, the recipe describes a jelly, though it is not quite evident  how clear it would be given the amount of meat particles likely to pass  into it. Calves\u2019 feet would produce a large amount of gelatin, causing  the broth to solidify when cool. Poured over pieces of cooked meat, this  will make a dish very like later S\u00fclze.\n\nAside from the question of opacity, we should take note of the  comparison: The sauce is meant to boil up \u201clike an egg sauce\u201d which  suggests it is viewed as similar to something like [the egg sauce galdrein in recipe #127](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/11/02/an-odd-galantine-recipe/)  which is clearly not a jelly. We may see these as entirely different   classes of dish, but it seems people at the time did not. How and to  what extent a sauce solidified was a matter of degree, not kind.\n\nFinally, and most notably, though: This recipe is called neither a *sulz* nor a *galrey*. Instead, it uses a French loan word. *Galentin* or *galentein* is a cognate of *galantine*,  the word used in contemporary French (and English) for these jellied  dishes. The word, like many others, did not survive in the German  tradition which only admits large amounts of foreign designations for  dishes after the turn of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

{"title": "Trying Out a Cake Mould", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/20/trying-out-a-cake-mould/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/20/trying-out-a-cake-mould/)\n\n I suppose it is time to stop apologising for the gaps between my posts  since this is  turning out to be the new normal. But I am now home again  and can give you the story of an experiment I did earlier in the week.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nioozy35zevb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=644341cf5e8f51a638e914a2eb9158ee4c2f8d14\n\nI enjoy going flea marketing and occasionally find vintage kitchen toys to play with, like that [mortar I used a while ago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/01/the-mortar-chicken-experiment/).  Three weeks ago, it was a glazed earthenware cake mould. These are not  uncommon on flea markets in Germany, but mostly quite large, so I was  gratified to find one more in keeping with my 1.5-person household\u2019s  needs and the size of a modern electric oven. It is basic, I think it is  pretty, and it most likely dates to the mid-twentieth century when  these were mass-produced. It is glazed on the inside and has a spike  going upwards that is meant to ensure the dough is cooked all the way  through. Once I had the time to play with it, I was resolved to do that.  \n\nThe recipe I went with was simple, a scaled-down version of a heavy  yeast cake as we find it in nineteenth-century cookbooks. I also used  dry yeast rather than live for logistical reasons, so this doesn\u2019t  really count as a reconstruction experiment. It was 300g of flour, 100g  of sugar, a pinch of salt, some cinnamon, mace, and cloves, and the dry  yeast mixed with one egg, 75g of melted butter, and enough warm milk to  make a heavy dough. I then folded in about 3/4 cup each (I did not weigh  them) or raisins and chopped nuts. This sounds a lot like Stollen  because it is from the same family, just simpler and less rich. The  dough took a long time to rise and did not grow by a lot, but it turned  out adequate to its purpose. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxemf1c9zevb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e70a6e1d8296b457094c5416447c41e55ab06d4\n\nMy cookbooks  did not offer much help about technique, so I went with a  commonsense approach. As the oven pre-heated, I put in the cake mould to  warm it up, then brushed it with butter on the inside and put in the  dough for a final rise on top of the stove. That turned out to work very  well. Afterwards, I put it into the oven at 180\u00b0C, and I suspect it  might have done better at a  higher temperature. It took a lot longer  than any metal pan would have, finally cooking through after over 90  minutes. I expected the insulating properties of the pottery to play a  role, but was surprised at how much. Not all the dough had fit, so I  opted for a metal pan to bake the rest and it was done and beginning to  be unpleasantly dry after 40 minutes.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1awzw6udzevb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2c4f5ae73f4ea493e93b1c71f823621f3c9bcde\n\n The result was not like what we think of as a Kuchen today. It was  hard and dry on the outside, heavy and dense, and not very sweet.  However, it improved with a few days\u2019 rest, which the recipes tend to  assume (in one case, the cake was even meant to be sent by parcel post).  I brushed it with  melted butter and dusted it with fine sugar, again a  common practice and still how you treat Stollen. The result, while  still harder and drier than that, was very nice and went well with  butter and jam. \n\nI wonder whether a thick-walled cake mould like this might not work  as a baking option on an open hearthfire if it was covered thoroughly  and turned regularly to produce an even heat. It may well be suitable  for much more liquid and richer doughs and batters, and I will  befinitely try that. As it is, though, it is far less practical than  modern metal pans and will at best be used occasionally.

Here  are another couple of similar recipes from the Mondseer Kochbuch, these  are for boiling pancakes in milk: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0vs8acm1gsb1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8288892b6a8211af990d11a004affdfb72ca913\n\n \n\n***59 To prepare a spoon dish (*****muos*****) of roast pears***\n\n***Prepare thin pancakes (*****fladen*****) of eggs.

Take apples and cut  them into it in cubes. Stir it well with egg yolks and boil it well and  serve it.***\n\nAgain, these recipes are almost identical to a set in the [Buoch von Guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (#65-67). Here, the dish is given a distinctive name: *col ris*. We find [similar preparations under the name ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[*kolreys*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) in [Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf).  Here, it is clear the name relates to rice, but of course the dish does  not include or mimic rice, so the origin of this may be a folk  etymology we can no longer reconstruct. Meanwhile, this recipe  collection classes the recipes as spoon dishes (muos) of pears (which  does not include any), eggs, and apples. The tradition of naming recipes  almost randomly continues to apply. \n\nThe preparation itself is easy and tasty, a good low-threshold dish for newcomers to medieval cuisine. Pancakes [as well as  fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/14/boiling-fritters-in-cgm-384-ii/) were also [cooked in savoury sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/26/a-pancake-dish-from-cgm-384-ii/),  but sweet tends to work better in modern culinary grammar. I have yet  to try the version with apples, but I am sure it will work well.  \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria).

It looks as though someone  drew on several related sources. These are all about fish with almond  milk:  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dls8x1lay1sb1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f58bff8cd3c806e13ae1e1f7aade8d8d8e9bf88c\n\n***49 How to prepare a spoon dish (*****muos*****) of roast fish***\n\n***You shall take a roast fish that is softened in vinegar  and remove its bones.

All the recipes are very  similar, though, combining fish and almond milk with a binder (rice  flour in the *Buoch von guoter Spise*, white flour or rice flour  in the Mondseer Kochbuch) and a small quantitiy of fat. It is, of  course, all quite luxurious, with high-end ingredients combined to  produce a Lenten treat, but I suspect it would all be rather bland. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

What exactly the author envisions is hard to parse, though.

They filled that hole with wood which  they let burn until it had become just coals (*****charbon*****) in order to properly heat the entire depth (*****concavit\u00e9*****)  of the hole. They then drew out the coals, laid the turtle on its back  at the bottom of the heated hole, and covered it with three or four  inches of hot sand from around it and the coals they had removed, with a  little sand on top. In this kind of natural pastry coffin and this  manner of oven, it cooked in the space of four hours, and it was cooked  far better than it would have been in an ordinary stove. And this is  what one calls a*** **Boucan de Tortue*****.***\n\nThis is altogether a credible account and a good description of the  kind of high-end cuisine that could be achieved with fairly basic  equipment. I do not envision the result as finely minced as a modern  forcemeat, but still chopped so as to meld the different flavours and  consistencies. The meat that adheres to the shell directly most likely  stayed inside the first turtle, being cooked whole and suffused with the  seasonings of the filling. We don\u2019t know exactly how large the turtle  in question was, but the dimensions of the earth oven suggest a large  specimen. To cook it completely in four hours (even allowing for a  certain imprecision in an age before exact pocket watches) would have  required a high heat. The preparation itself is close to something [Marx Rumpolt describes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/02/15/rumpolt-on-tortoises/)as being done with tortoises in Europe in 1581, though these are boiled, not cooked in an earth oven: \n\n***9 Take the tortoises and hollow them out so that the  shell stays together. Chop the meat together with eggs and green herbs,  and add fresh butter. Fill the shells with it and boil them in a broth,  be it sour or sweet, and serve them with the shells on. This is called  filled tortoises.***\n\nIt is interesting that Labat uses the word *boucan* to refer  to a method of cooking \u2013 over a wooden grille \u2013 and the kind of meat  that resulted, but also as a social occasion. It is applied in that  sense here. A *boucan* was a feast held in the wilderness, away  from the social conventions of grand homes, and is associated closely  with the people of that realm, the *chasseurs*, *boucaniers*, and *flibustiers* he  speaks of in awed and perplexed tones.  It is more than likely they  fully understood the value of their notoriety and, like the cowboys of  the Old West when faced with curious townspeople, laid it on with a  trowel. Still, Labat is a contemporary eyewitness and his account  generally reliable. \n\nActually replicating what this dish tasted like will be hugely  challenging. The seasoning is good \u2013 I have already worked with it and  found it balanced well if you emphasise the lemon and keep a light touch  with the chili. Finding a reasonable  substitute for turtle meat is far  harder. Few sources agree on what to compare it with, and while I have  tried veal, lamb, and richly marbled pork singly and in combination, I  am no nearer to understanding wehich comes close. Cooking it in a closed  container, by comparison, is fairly trivial, though it will need to  heat up fast and  high. This is no crockpot dish.

Meat, apples, and bacon and eggs as a binder should make viable filling  for a pie or pastry, as seems to be suggested here. The recipe again  occurs almost verbatim in the [Buoch von Guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (5a).

The consistency of the dough is  sometimes used as a reference, just as that of strauben batter is in  other places. That is, aside from one other recipe that [calls green eggs that](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/25/green-eggs-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/),  though here a misreading is the more likely culprit.

In the absence of leftover  roast, we cooked some ground beef and mixed it with chopped bacon and  apple. This was not meant as the most plausible or tastiest  interpretation, but as proof of concept and something we could do  despite being tired after a long day museuming. For that, it worked. The  combination is viable (apple is married to beef or mutton in the [Arabic medieval tradition](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/18/a-middle-eastern-feast-for-easter-2022/)  as well). Cooked in a loosely cohesive mass between sheets of  storebought tarte dough, it was slightly too dry and not really aromatic  enough. I am considering a few possible tweaks to the recipe as a  result. Simply increasing the proportion of dough to filling would allow  for the spices to dominate more, which might be enough for smaller  pastries, especially if they are fried. It may also be a good idea to  cook the apples before putting them into the mix, or perhaps use aged or  even dried apples for more concentrated aroma. Alternatively, mashing  the ingredients in a mortar could produce a more intensely aromatic and  cohesive filling. It may also be worth trying out more spices \u2013 nutmeg  and mace suggest themselves \u2013 but the recipe is unusually specific in  its brief list. \n\nI liked it, and I think I can make it better.

Then you should cut it into thin slices. Take clear,  thick honey (*****honigsaim*****) and boil it, and take ginger and  galingale and cloves, pound them together and throw them in. Then take a  small cask or a vat into which you wish to put it and wash it very  clean. Then pour in a layer of honey and a layer of liver, and so on.***\n\nThis method of preserving cooked meat comes up repeatedly in various sources, and the sauce used for it often referred to as a *sulcz*. The earliest such reference I know of is the [salsa dominorum](https://atasteofhistorywithjoycewhite.blogspot.com/2014/09/a-bold-12th-century-sauce-for-lords.html)  in the Harpestreng manuscripts (V and VI). Here, spices are mixed with  vinegar and the sauce thickened with toasted bread, a method we find  frequently in German [*galrey* or *sulcz* recipes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/28/galray-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/). I have [already written about](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/08/medieval-gelatin-powder-and-the-next-book-project/)  how these words would eventually expand to refer to clear gelatin  aspics and thast their usage remained inconsistent well into the  seventeenth century. Here, we see another aspect of this development. \n\nThe recipe describes the process of sealing cooked meat under honey with a verb, *sulzet*. That verb does appear on occasion later and its modern form, *(ein)s\u00fclzen*,  refers to enclosing foods in aspic. Clearly, it had a broader original  meaning, and it had no connection with a specific ingredioent. Most  sauces described as sulcz contain broth or cooked meat and thus could  conceivably have gelled. This clearly cannot \u2013 it\u2019s honey. Thus, *sulzen* at this point refers to preserving under a sauce, the *sulcz*. \n\nI am not fond of liver in general, but I am willing to give this  recipe a try out of sheer curiosity. Honey with ginger, galingale and  cloves sounds like an attractive combination. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements.

It was first brought to us from Arabia and  India, but these days also grows commonly in many islands such as  Rhodes, Cyprus, the Canary and Fortunate Islands and many other places  including (as I have reported) in Italy. Such pleasant, sweet juice of  sugar is said to have been entirely unknown to the ancient physicians  Dioscurides, Galen, Paul and others and was a new discovery of the Arab  physicians. From them, it gained such a reputation and general usage  that it did not stay confined to the pharmacy for medicines, but was  especially passed on to cooks in the kitchen and is used in all kinds of  dishes and especially in foreign beverages which court taste by being  mixed in the most indulgent fashion. Thus arose the saying: Sugar spoils  no dish.***\n\n***The manner of the plant that produces this lovely sweet  juice is, as stated above, a kind of reed from which the juice is taken  and boiled and clarified many times so that it turns snow white. Inn the  end, it is poured into great \u2018hats\u2019 (cones) which are then brought to  us.***\n\n***Sugar is of cold and moist nature in the first degree. It  purges, loosens and diffuses as was said of honey (above), except that  it does not raise a thirst as it is the way of honey. The stomach also  does not develop an itching or burning (heartburn) from it as it does  with honey. It stills and softens the belly and serves the chest and  lungs as much as the bladder and kidney. The older the sugar is, the  better it becomes in warmth, fineness and subtlety, but it becomes  damaging to the head.***\n\n***When sugar is dissolved in water and boiled, it receives  coldness and is gentled in its heat. That is why it can always be given  with convenient moist and useful waters (distilled herbal waters) when  it is provided as medicine, especially in confits (*****Confectt\u00e4felin*****) so that it receives their virtues and powers.***\n\n***The smoke of sugar burned on glowing coals and taken in  by the nose stills the powerful flows of the head. That is why sugar is  also useful in medicinal incenses (*****Rauchk\u00e4rtzlin*****) and pastilles which are produced for their pleasing scent.***\n\n***To Clarify Sugar***\n\n***Sugar should be cleaned to the best and finest whenever it is used. In apothecaries\u2019 shops, this is called clarifying (*****clarificirn*****).  It is done this way: Take your sugar which you intend to use and pound  or beat it into small pieces. Pour on water and set it on a gentle, weak  coal fire so that it dissolves (*****zergehe oder schmelzt*****). Take  several egg yolks (I suspect a typographical error \u2013 likely means egg  whites), according to how much sugar you have and also how clean or  unclean it is, two egg whites to a pound, and place them in a clean  dish. Pour clear water to them and beat it with a little broom made of  clean, thin branches tied together to a white foam. Throw this upon the  boiling sugar and it will draw all uncleanness to itself. Let it boil  well together, then strain it through a clean white woolen cloth. If the  said sugar is not clarified enough by this cleaning process, set it on  the fire again, let it boil once more with clean water, prepare another  beaten foam and also pour that into the boiling sugar. Strain it again.  You shall do this as long and as often as is needed to make the sugar  entirely clear and pure, that is clarified. The boil it to a suitable  stiffness (*****bequemer h\u00e4rt*****) as common honey tends to be by itself. Keep it for many needs as its common use for many purposes is described below.***\n\n***Also note here that almost all electuaries and the most  prominent syrups should be prepared with sugar. Especially those to be  used against fevers and long illnesses. For it is not as hot and dry as  honey and is also more potent, pleasant, and suitable for all medicine.***\n\nThis is interesting in itself and confirms what we already saw in the [1559 Koestlich und Fuertrefflich Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/11/clarifying-sugar/):  Sugar was clarified by  boiling with egg white, and it seems that it  was them stopred and used in a semi-liquid form. That has implications  for all kinds of recipes that call for large amounts of sugar,  especially the almond pastes, that mention no liquids. Sugar can in fact  be a luiquid in the sixteenth-century German kitchen. \n\nWalter Ryff, a somewhat enigmatic figure, was a medical professional  and incredibly prolific author in the mid-16th century.

There is however, an interesting phenomenon, a dark beer associated with Ireland that is popular all across the English-speaking West Indies; Guinness.\r  \n\r  \nThe [history of Guinness in the Caribbean](https://tastetrinbago.com/the-history-of-guinness-in-the-caribbean/) is an examination in local drinking culture within the region, and also the story of how a small Dublin brewery grew into a global beverage giant.\n\nIn 1799, Arthur Guinness had four decades of brewing experience when he decided to end the production of ale and focus exclusively on a style of dark beer called porter.\r  \n\r  \nWithin Dublin, he sold Town Porter, while the slightly stronger and more hoppy Country Porter was available at pubs across all of Ireland along with Superior Porter which was stronger, and included some cask aged stock. He also brewed Keeping Porter, a flat beer that was slightly stale, and used for blending into other products to preserve them and ensure consistency.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1801, an entry in a brewery journal for West Indies Porter marked an addition to these four, and the earliest reference to Guinness brewing a beer specifically for the Caribbean market. Guinness West Indies Porter was brewed to be stronger, and fortified with extra hops and a small amount of sour beer. This beer was designed to survive the long journey across the Atlantic and the heat and humidity of the Caribbean.\r  \n\r  \nOver time, a stronger version of Superior Porter, first called Extra Superior Porter and eventually Guinness Extra Stout emerged. In a similar manner, West Indies Porter would be renamed Guinness Foreign Extra Stout. The recipe also changed with time. Instead of brown malt, a new type of dark malt called patent malt was increasingly used to provide the characteristic colour and flavour, so that pale malt could form the bulk of the beer. This resulted in a divergence in style between the drier Irish stouts and the sweet English stouts that still used brown malt.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the market for stout in the Caribbean kept growing, Guinness did not have a monopoly in the region since many drinkers did not understand the concept of a beer brand at that point. Only in 1862 did the company adopt the now iconic harp logo. Even so, export bottlers still used their own name and iconography on bottles and drinkers often asked for Guinness by the name of the image on the bottle. Very often, this was the image of an animal like a wolf, a pelican, or a flamingo. Bottles of Guinness in the West Indies would sometimes be sold under different names depending on the British company who bottled it and the importer who brought it in. In Malaysia, drinkers still request Guinness by asking for a \u201cblack dog\u201d due to the popularity of two bottlers who used a bulldog image on their labels.\r  \n\r  \nIn the early 1950s, the recipe for Guinness Foreign Extra Stout was modified. The principle of blending highly hopped young beer with long aged sour beer stayed the same, what changed was the proportions and properties of the beer blended to create Foreign Extra Stout. This decade also saw the release of the Guinness Book of World Records, one of the top-selling non-fiction books of all time that is arguably the most popular product from the company.\r  \n\r  \nThe next decade also saw significant strides for the company. They perfected the technology of pouring the perfect pint of Guinness, thus introducing nitrogen infused Guinness Draught to pubs across the United Kingdom and North America. They also built an enormous brewing complex in West Africa. By this time, more than half of the Guinness that was exported went to Africa, and Nigeria was now the third largest market behind Ireland and England. Like the rest of the British Commonwealth, Nigeria was seeking Independence and local politicians were promising to focus on indigenous manufacturing in order to reduce imports. Building a brewery in the country that was projected to one day drink the most Guinness made sense. It also came with challenges. The company had no experience making beer in a tropical climate, and the high temperature and humidity would have effects on both the fermentation and maturation of the beer. Suitable housing and social clubs for staff also had to be built and a program put in place to train Nigerian brewers.\r  \n\r  \nPerhaps the biggest issue was that as a new nation, Nigeria would likely face political challenges. Violent regime change could potentially lead to a government that was unfriendly to Western companies. Some of this would come to pass and the early years of Guinness being brewed in Africa were against the backdrop of political instability. Nigeria became independent in 1960. The brewery was built just north of Lagos two years later, and within another five years, there was a coup, a counter-coup, and a Civil War on the horizon. In some ways, the Biafra Conflict paralleled The Troubles that had recently started in Ireland. Both were longstanding disagreements turned violent between ethnic groups who may have seemed no different to outside observers. Ultimately, these political issues would have practically no effect on establishing the brewery and locally brewed Guinness would be on shelves in Africa within a year of completion.\r  \n\r  \nGuinness would also build a brewery in Jamaica to satisfy the demand of the Caribbean market, but its completion in the early 1970s would coincide with civil unrest and an economic downturn. At this time, local brewing company Desnoes and Geddes had recently acquired the rights to bottle Heineken locally and were expanding their distribution of Red Stripe Beer. Guinness was popular in Jamaica but in the face of stiff competition in an increasingly difficult market the operation was not profitable enough to justify the factory. They would eventually sell the brewing facility to Desnoes and Geddes who would bottle and distribute Guinness Foreign Extra under contract. A similar arrangement would be made in 1981 with the Carib Brewery in Trinidad and Tobago.\r  \n\r  \nNone of these breweries ever brewed the finished stout, they would make the young, heavily hopped component and blend it with a small amount of liquid shipped from Ireland. Referred to internally as Guinness Flavor Extract, this concentrated essence from Ireland contains the sour tang of aged beer, the bitterness of hops, and the trademark notes of heavily roasted barley. Combining these two beers represents an evolution of the original idea for West Indian Porter that offers certain advantages. It gives the local brewers the flexibility to use a broader range of grains beyond the traditional barley. Sorghum is often used in Africa while corn, rice, barley, and even cassava are used in the Caribbean."]}

A good cook was expected to use every piece of the chicken.\n\n***129 If you would serve a good dish of hens, take young chickens and pound the feet, neckflaps (kr\u00e4glein),  livers and necks and prepare pounded chicken from that. Then boil the  chickens, as many of them as you wish, and serve them, in that*** **gem\u00fcez**. ***That is also an uncommon dish.***\n\n***130 If you would prepare a furhes from the (the above  chickens\u2019) blood, take wine and cut off their necks and catch the blood  in the wine. Then boil this together and thicken it with toasted bread.  If you wish, take their innards (ingeweide) and serve it in this, or chop it, and grate bread into it etc.***\n\n***(\u2026)***\n\n***133 If you would make sausages from chicken\u2019s necks (kragen),  take beef and chop it small with 3 or 4 eggs, and season it. Then take  the necks and leave the crops attached to the necks, and fill the  chopped meat into them. If you have meat left over, form small balls  from it and fill them into the feet. Also put the stomachs into the  feet. Then boil them and serve them in a yellow sauce (prulein) or*** **pfefflein** ***sauce that is also yellow, or in a chicken puree (h\u00fcern muez) or a*** **ziseindel** ***sauce etc.***\n\nThese are obviously not recipes that would be made in parallel, but  they nicely illustrate how a cook was expected to use the various parts  of the chicken in secondary dishes. In every case, the main fleshy parts  of the bird would be served boiled or roasted and the side dishes could  either make the meal stretch for more people at the table, or they  could be served alongside to provide amusement and variety. This was  very likely a lot more common than we instinctively assume.\n\nRecipe #129 is basically a way of turning meaty pieces into a meat  mush that is then used as a cooking sauce. This is not what we would do,  but attested  several times in the medieval corpus, though usually for  serving separately. The description as an uncommon dish is a positive  trait. The word *seltsam* used for it means remarkable more than  weird in this context, and a degree of openness to novelty was expected  of upper-class diners in medieval Germany.\n\nRecipe #130 is a fairly typical *f\u00fcrhess*, a blood-thickened  sauce that is used to serve smaller pieces of meat or organ meats. There  are many such recipes prepared from the blood of a wide variety of  animals, and the entire class is so broad the word would come to refer  to all kinds of side dishes involving meat.\n\nFinally, recipe #133  uses the neck and crop (most likely the  esophagus) as well as the skin of the feet to fill with a meat stuffing  and cook as a sausage in the broadest of sense. These were then served  in a variety of sauces, depending, we assume, on the taste of the  recipients. A yellow *prulein* wouild be a saffron-coloured and spiced sauce based on cooking liquids. I suspect the distinction to the *pfefflein* or *pfefferlein* sauce is mainly that the former is thinner while the latter is always thickened, usually with bread. A *ziseindel* sauce involved onions and/or apples cooked to a mush. The *h\u00fcern muez* very likely is an error and intended to read *h\u00fcner muez*,  a chicken meat puree like the one described in #129. It could  conceivably also mean a brain mush, a dish that existed, but we do not  know of being used as a sauce. We should in all cases assume that the  dishes were seasoned generously.\n\nThe Innsbrucker Rezeptbuch is a manuscript recipe collection from a  South German/Austrian context. It dates to the mid-fifteenth century and  survives as part of a set of medical and culinary texts bound together.  The editor Doris Aichholzer published it together with two related  manuscripts and drew attention to the less elaborate, more practical  recipes. The manuscript is of unknown provenance, but has been owned by  the Habsburg emperors since at least the early sixteenth century. It is  now held at the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna. An edition, German  translation and commentary can be found in Doris Aichholzer: Wildu  machen ayn guet essen\u2026 Drei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher, Peter Lang  Verlag Berne et al. 1999", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/14cro9u/chicken_offal_dishes_c_1450/", "created_utc": 1687113627.0, "score": 3, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/14cro9u/chicken_offal_dishes_c_1450/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

It briefly explored the cultivation of the common bean by Native Americans, and it looked at popular versions of red beans and rice within the region; This included dishes like Jamaican Peas and Rice, as well as Louisiana Red Beans and Rice.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, it looked at the popularity of red beans among the African diaspora of the West Indies and the American South compared to other varieties of the common bean. This seems to be due to a preference for red colored rice dishes from West Africa like Jollof Rice and Thieboudienne. Just as members of the African diaspora have a preference for red beans, it seems that the preference for black beans across most of Latin America is also due to a preference for food that resembles their ancestral dishes.\n\nMesoamericans used beans of many different colors, but their recipes often called for cacao paste, or blackened dried chili peppers, known in Mexico as chile ancho. This resulted in dishes that had a dark, or even black color. This is possibly a reason why Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean with a strong Mestizo culture prefer black beans over red beans in their food.\r  \nOne method of serving black beans and rice is to make Frijoles Negros by cooking the beans with cumin, tomato paste and other seasonings and then serving it alongside white rice or yellow rice. Very often this would be part of a larger meal with [fried plantains](https://tastetrinbago.com/tostones-twice-fried-plantains/), shredded pork or beef. Pabell\u00f3n Criollo from Venezuela, or Casado from Costa Rica are examples of this. Casado is a Spanish term for a married man, and the dish may have got this name from diners asking for the meal that a married man might expect to get from his wife at home.\n\nAnother common way to cook black beans and rice is in one pot. In Central America, this is known as Gallo Pinto. This dish is popular in both Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama and the name refers to the dish having the appearance of a speckled hen due to the look of the black beans mixed with white rice. The dish is similar across those countries, but Costa Ricans often use a condiment known as Lizano sauce when cooking theirs and in Nicaragua, red beans are sometimes used.\r  \n\r  \nIn Cuba, this dish has also acquired a nickname; Moros y Cristianos. This name is supposedly a reference to the color of the black beans and white rice being similar to black Moors and White Christians respectively. This explanation is likely more complicated than that since Moro de Guandules is a term used for pigeon peas and rice in the Dominican Republic. Moro as a descriptive term for these dishes might initially have been a reference to Africa and Moorish cuisine. References to Africa feature across the names of several rice and legume dishes in the Caribbean, especially in versions of [pigeon peas and rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/CaribbeanFood/comments/13j2my8/rice_and_pigeon_peas_across_the_caribbean/) since the legume used in such dishes originated in West Africa."]}

Let  them boil an hour or four. When they are boiled, draw them out of their  shells and take their fore and hind parts separately. Rub the front part  well with salt, that way  the slime  comes away, and wash them cleabnly  in six or seven waters so they are not slimy. Pepper them well and cut  green, fragrant herbs very small. Pour good, fresh butter over them and  stir it into the snails. Wash the shells nicely clean and then put the  snails into them. Place them in a baking dish (*****Turtenpfannen)  together with the shells, set them on the coals and let them boil inside  their shells. If there is too little butter in it, pour on more. When  they have boiled, arrange them in a bowl and serve them warm. Strew  (schuet) a little pepper on the  bowl, on the rim, because snails must  be well peppered.**\n\n***2 Take snails once they are boiled, nicely washed, and  rubbed well with salt, and cut them small. Add green, fragrant herbs and  place it in a fish kettle (Fischkessel)  together, and add  butter. Set it on coals and fry it well. Take eggs,  beat them togfether, salt them, and let them run through a haircloth.  Add pounded pepper and a little saffron and stir it into the snails with  the eggs until it boils up. When it has boiled up, serve it, thus they  turn out good and well-tasting.***\n\n***3 Snails for frying. When they are cooked and cleaned,  you salt and pepper them well and fry them (coated) with flour. When you  take them out of the butter, see that they are served quickly and strew  them with ginger. Thus it turns out good and well-tasting.***\n\n***4 Snails cooked in liquid (eyngemacht) with pea broth, green parsley, and with butter, and well peppered.***\n\n***5 Take snails that have been fried, pour mustard and butter over them and serve them warm.***\n\n***6 Take snails and cook (fricusier) them nicely  in butter with green, fragrant herbs that are chopped small. Pepper it  well and do not oversalt it. Thuis they turn out good and well-tasting.***\n\n***7 Take the hind part that you have cut off before, rub it well with salt and wash it cleanly. Throw it into hot butter and fry (roest) it thoroughly. Pepper and salt it, thus it will turn out good and well-tasting.***\n\n***8  Snails cooked in pastries, especially if they are  boiled and cleaned, see that they are well peppered and prepared with  butter in the pastry. Thus they turn out good and well-tasting.***\n\n***9 Snails served with olive oil.***\n\nThese recipes again show Rumpolt as by far the better writer and  quite possibly the better  cook as well. Still, there seems to be  general agreement that snails are seasoned exactly one way, with butter  and herbs. It is hard to say whether this was long-standing custom \u2013  which is plausible \u2013 or a novel, Italianate style that made them  acceptable to the wealthy and powerful. Certainly the variety in  preparations shows that snails were familiar in the kitchen and served  in a variety of ways.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/116lesi/snail_recipes_from_1581/", "created_utc": 1676834421.0, "score": 3, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/116lesi/snail_recipes_from_1581/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Then take a ma\u00df of milk and pour it into a pan. Let it boil until it firms up (*****herdt wirdt*****). Then take a strainer (*****durchschlag*****)  and strain the eggs into the boiling milk. Sprinkle a little vinegar  through it over the eggs in the pan. Let it all boil together nicely.  Push it together with the spoon and let it boil as long as soft eggs.  Take it out of the pan with the spoon and put it into a small sieve (*****Syblein*****) so that it drains finely through it. Then place it in a clean flat grinding bowl (*****scherben*****) and grind it well. Add May butter (*****Mayen Schmaltz*****)  the size of a nutshell and grind it again for a time. Afterwards again  another one (repeat the step), and you shall add May butter six times  and cook it down well (*****einsieden*****) each time and also grate  sugar into it, as much as the butter and very finely so that it melts in  the mouth like the butter. Then put it into a bowl like other porridge,  and strew ground sugar on it. Thus you have a*** **Mayen mu\u00df*****.***\n\nThere are several surviving recipes for \u2018May dish\u2019, *Maienessen*, *cibus Maiis* or, in this case, *Mayen mu\u00df*,  from a number of sources and the unifying feature seems to be butter  and sugar. Butter, of course, was a seasonal pleasure of spring when  cattle returned to pasture and gave more copious milk again. May butter  referred to fresh butter that was neither salted nor clarified to  preserve it. At the time, this was not available year round. \n\nThis recipe is not entirely clear, but it seems to involve combining  butter and custard in a laborious process, adding small quantities and  possibly heating it repeatedly. It seems to be fairly closely related to  the [*cibus Maiis* described in the *libellus de lacte*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/06/15/biscotti-and-may-dish-for-a-vigil/).  The use of custard instead of cheese seems like a major difference, but  as we see from Anna Wecker\u2019s Koestlich New Kochbuch of 1598, the two  were often considered interchangeable. That is also interesting because  it suggests that while there is little or no textual connection between  Anna Wecker\u2019s work and this recipe collection, they belong to the same  culinary culture.   \n\nThis short book was first printed in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted  in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently. Despite ist brevity, it is  interesting especially as it contains many recipes for *k\u00fcchlein*,  baked or deep-fried confections, that apparently played a significant  role in displaying status. We do not know who the famous cook\u2018  referenced in the title may have been or if he ever existed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/yyvjwz/mayen_mus_from_the_1559_kuenstlichs_und/", "created_utc": 1668808076.0, "score": 3, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/yyvjwz/mayen_mus_from_the_1559_kuenstlichs_und/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

It  pays to look twice \u2013 thank you! Here is a recipe to whet the appetite: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jw1qpvidhk0a1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8db0256f8117841311e04351ebedf7c05a27361\n\n ***3 An autumn spoon dish (*****Herbstm\u00fc\u00df*****)***\n\n***Take a handful (each?) of almond kernels,*** **Weinperlin** ***and*** **Rosin** ***(two  kinds of raisins) and remove the pips. Blanch the almonds. Take one as  much as the other and chop all three ingredients together, not too  small, but nicely coarse. Then add caraway, (possibly omission here:  Take bread,) grate it and fry (*****roests*****) in fat, and pour on*** **Reinfal** ***or another good, common wine and pour that onto the bread that has been fried (*****geroestet*****).  Let it boil and add sugar. Then take the three ingredients that were  chopped, add them to the bread and season it nicely. You must not colour  it yellow. It must be seasoned like a*** **Weinmue\u00df*****. Let it boil down so that it thickens like an oat porridge (*****haberbrew*****). Thus you will have a good autumn spoon dish (*****Herbstmue\u00df*****)***\n\nThe source in question is a small printed volume of 50-odd pages, *Ein  sehr Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch von allerley Speisen auch  wie man Latwergen und Zucker einmachen soll unnd sunst von anderen  gutten haimlichen Kuensten Ainem jeden im hau\u00df sehr notwendig und  nuetzlich zu gebrauchen*. It was first printed in Augsburg in 1559 and went through several reprints, but never reached the popularity of the *Kuchenmaistrey* tradition  or Staindl. A comparison with the surviving manuscript sources from  Augsburg which date to a slightly earlier time seems promising. The book  itself does not appear connected to any of the other print traditions,  but the first recipe for wine-based bread porridge is reminiscent of #44  in the recipe collection of [Sabina Welser](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Sabrina_Welserin.html). \n\nThis third recipe is interesting for its seasonal association. It could obviously be made at any time, but it is a *Herbstm\u00fc\u00df*,  an autumnal dish. The association may lie in the colours as a brown  bread porridge is enriched with darker raisins and lighter almonds (we  assume the existence of bread, either as a misprint \u2013 the caraway \u2013 or  an omission before the instruction to grate and fry it, which parallels  the first recipe). The entire dish is obviously quite luxurious. Raisins  \u2013 I assume that *Weinperlin* describes a softer, larger kind and *Rosin* a smaller, drier one, but am not quite sure yet \u2013 almonds and *Reinfal*, a fashionable wine of the Ribolla gialla grape, were all expensive status ingredients. The instruction to season it like a *Weinmue\u00df*  refers  to recipe #1 in this collection which is sweetened with sugar, coloured  with saffron, has ginger added and is served strew with Trisanet.

It is probable all these birds were eaten, but not often and almost certainly not at the same time. Unfortunately, we do not get a lot of information about how they were prepared, either.\n\nThe list begins with a blessing to all birds that are *piscibus equipares*, equal to fish. This may simply be a reference to Genesis where birds and fish are created at the same time, but more likely is a reference to dietary rules that specified certain birds licit for monks to eat or permitted during Lent. This was a contentious issue at the time and I do not know which side Ekkehart IV came down on, but this may in fact be a comment positioning himself. Those more knowledgeable than me can probably explain.\n\nThe first three birds named, the swan, pheasant, and peacock, take us to the highest levels of conspicuous consumption. This was what noblemen ate. It bears remembering, though, that Ekkehart himself worked at the centre of the imperial church and would have seen, if not tasted, such things. They are followed by the more pedestrian, but still classy, goose which features under two names. *Anser* in #78 is the classical Latin term for a goose and refers to a domesticated bird. *Auca* in #79 is a postclassical term and may be mewanbt to refer to a wild goose, but it is equally possible that Ekkehart is just showing off his broad vocabulary. The crane is certainly a gamebird while the duck may be domesticated or wild \u2013 the list, unlike the later section on four-footed animals, does not seem to make that distinction systematically.\n\nIn #82, we find an interesting observation on the behaviour of a wild bird. We know that quail (Coturnix coturnix) play dead to distract predators, and pretending to be injured is something other bird species are also known to do. A similar note is struck in #90. This is the kind of observation a hunter would make. The *pernix* referenced here is most likely *Lagopus muta helvetica*, the isolated Alpine population of rock ptarmigans.\n\nBoth pigeons and chickens receive multiple entries, with the chickens separated not just by species, but by culinary rank. *Gallina* in #86 specifically refers to a female, egg-laying chicken, a valuable, but not very tasty bird. Meanwhile, the *castrati galli* of #87 are capons, particularly esteemed for their tender meat, and the *pulli* of #88 are young birds.\n\nFinally, there are a large number of entries that refer to no specific species. Small birds in general would have meat all kinds of songbirds trapped in the wild. Though taxonomically distinct, they were treated all the same in the kitchen. The word *decipula* in #92 can also mean traps more generally, but slings are probably meant here. It is one method by which songbirds were traditionally caught in Europe, the others being thrown nets or glue traps. #93 also is no reference to any species of bird, but a religious analogy associating the silhouette of birds in flight with the cross. #94 returns to the theme of permitted creatures, very relevant in the context of Lent and especially for monks engaged in interpreting the Rule of St Benedict.\n\nThe *Benedictiones ad Mensas* were produced by [Ekkehart IV of St Gall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekkehard_IV), most likely initially written during his tenure as head of the Mainz cathedral school between 1022 and 1031, but expanded and revised until his death in St Gall in 1057. Theyare a collection of blessings to be spoken over food. Written in short rhyming couplets in Latin, they are unusual in their attention to the diversity of foods and preparations. This is not a serious work of theology or medicine, but an intellectual diversion, playful verse meant to show off a broad vocabulary and facility with Latin. That is what makes them very valuable \u2013 they give us a glimpse of the mental horizon of a senior cleric of the 11th century at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1e3atvt/blessings_for_birds_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1720985570.0, "score": 2, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1e3atvt/blessings_for_birds_11th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Time only for a  short recipe (actually two), again from Philippine Welser\u2019s collection: \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zt072a60tvwc1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c605e936b5d78cc49f54c779034d8ebfe37abcff\n\n***69 A pastry made of veal***\n\n***Take veal, parboil it well and chop it. Take half as much  kidney fat of an ox or more than half and also chop that with it. Salt  it, and when it is chopped, put it into a bowl and add ginger, cinnamon,  pepper, raisins, sugar, and a good sweet wine. Stir it well together so  it becomes as thin as a mu\u00df. You can also add the yolks of  hard-boiled eggs into it whole, as many as you like. Then put it into  the pastry crust and let it bake for one and a half hours, thus it is  proper. When it is almost baked, you can put in broth with verjuice, and  also put in saffron.***\n\n***70 Further, a pastry of veal***\n\n***Take meat for dumplings (knepfel flesch) and  boil it well and then take half as much or more kidney fat from an ox  and chop it together with salt. When it is chopped, prepare a round  pastry case. Take a lot of raisins and ginger and put that into the  chopped (meat) and stir it together. Boil hard as many eggs as you want  or according to how large the pastry is. Put the filling into the pastry  case and lay in the eggs, just the yolks, into it whole. Also add a  little saffron, or (do it) in the end when you put in the verjuice, that  is better. Close it with a top crust and let it bake properly. When it  is half baked, take verjuice and soup broth and a little saffron and  stir it together. Make a hole at the top (of the crust) and put in the  broth with a funnel. Let it bake fully, about 2 hours altogether.***\n\nAs seems to happen quite a bit, these two recipes are so similar it  is hard to see the point of writing down both. Aside from wine and a  different spice mixture, the flavour and consistency aimed for seems  close to identical in both. They are also unadventurous; tender, light  meat, plenty of fat, rich spices, and a touch of sourness from verjuice  added to prevent it from drying out. Of course, much depends on  proportions here, but i could see this working for a modern palate as  long as they appreciate sweet blandness. One interesting point is that  hard-boiled egg yolks are put into the filling whole. No doubt they were  visually interesting once the finished pastry was sliced. Whole  hard-boiled eggs are still put into traditional German Hackbraten, meat  loaf, today. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

Move it about in the pan, then take the  abovementioned egg white, beat it well, and pour it into the hot fat.  Move it about as well so it will for a fine tart base (*****bedalin*****). Then pour the cream and the eggs on the tart base, put embers above and below, and let it bake nicely.***\n\nI am trying to imagine what this would look and taste like; a white,  soft skin surrounding the base of a  golden yellow, creamy, fluffy  filling, impossibly rich and probably quite subtle in the company of  more heavily seasoned and sweetened dishes. The skill involved in  getting it right must have made this quite a flex to serve. \n\n \n\nThe idea of using a sheet of fried egg as a container for a  filling  is not novel, of course, and even making a tart base out of it is  described in several recipes, including one that actually comes from the  same family: \n\n***To make an Italian tart***\n\n***Take twelve pears and roast them quickly over a lively  fire, until the peel is charred and the rest becomes soft, afterwards  put them through a strainer and put sugar, cinnamon and twelve eggs  therein. Make a thin batter with eggs and pour it into a hot tart pan  and  let it bake until it becomes hard and pour the mixture onto it and  let it bake.***\n\nThis is from the recipe collection of Sabina Welser in the [translation by Valoise Armstrong](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Sabrina_Welserin.html).  Clearly it is not the same thing, but a similar bit of culinary  trickery. I would probably enjoy this more, but I really long to try the  cream version, if only to see in how many ways it can go wrong. \n\nPhilippine Welser (1527-1580), a member of the prominent and  extremely wealthy Welser banking family of Augsburg, was a famous beauty  of her day.

Today\u2019s is for and *antidotum*,  what I think we would call a digestive tonic:   \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85ltx7j4io1c1.jpg?width=1399&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a357a0b194ea01d96e108c367302a823d2871ac\n\n***323 Take in equal quantities soda ash (nitrum), pepper, and cumin (cyminum)  and as much rue as all three of these. You must first soak the cumin in  sour wine and fry it on hot iron. All three are then well pounded and  mixed with honey. If you enjoy of this antidote often, it will heal the  pain of your chest and sides, liver and kidneys, it dilutes the gall,  softens a hard belly without causing it to rumble (sine tormine), comforts the stomach and enables it to digest food well.***\n\nI am guessing this could have the desired effect. Cumin is a  digestive aid, and honey has known health benefits if eaten in  moderation. I am less sure about the *nitrum* (Mayer and Goehl ambiguously translate *Steinsalz*, but *nitrum* usually means *natron* i.e. a [compound mostly containing sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natron)).  If that is the correct rendering, it would add antiacidic properties  which plain rock salt would not have. The taste of sodium carbonate is  less than pleasant, though. Rue, aside from being a bitter culinary  herb, is an abortifacient, so if you decide you want to try this, it  should not be taken during pregnancy. \n\nThe [Macer Floridus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macer_floridus)  is a herbal that was extremely popular throughout the Middle Ages and  the Renaissance in all of Europe, and especially in Germany. It was most  likely written in the mid-eleventh century by Odo of Meung, but this is  somewhat uncertain and the early version could date from as early as  the ninth century. Its final form of 77 chapters, drawing on material  from Constantinus Africanus, certainly existed by 1100. We know with  certainty that it was not authored by the classical Roman writer [Aemilius Macer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilius_Macer)to whom early editors ascribed it.\n\nThe Macer is a relatively brief treatment of the pharmaceutical  properties of various plants, drawing on various classical and medieval  sources. It does not contain culinary recipes, but some remarks in it  are nonetheless interesting from that perspective. I excerpted several  paragraphs I found interesting with a view to culinary preparation,  feasting, and lifestyle medicine. It should not need saying that these  are not medical recommendations. While some recipes in Macer may  actually have an appreciable effect, others can be seriously dangerous,  and none hold up to modern evidence-based practice.\n\nI am relying on the [scholarly edition of 1834](https://archive.org/details/deviribusherbaru00mace/page/28/mode/2up) and a German translation by Johannes Gottfried Mayer and Konrad Goehl that is [still in print](https://www.froelichundkaufmann.de/ratgeber/kraeuterbuch-der-klostermedizin-der-macer-floridus.html).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/180e1fe/an_antidotum_digestive_from_macer_floridus_11th_c/", "created_utc": 1700562753.0, "score": 2, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/180e1fe/an_antidotum_digestive_from_macer_floridus_11th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

Then  temper (*****tempier*****) it all together and fill a pig\u2019s stomach with it, but not too full, and boil it when it is raw (*****seud in gr\u00fcn*****). When it is cooked, loosen the filling from the stomach entirely, cut it in slices, and chop it well with eggs.***\n\nThis is obviously related to modern [Saumagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saumagen)  of political fame, the dish that Helmut Kohl tested the digestion of  visitors of state with, but that is not what makes the recipe  interesting. [Filling stomachs with food and boiling it](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/14/boil-in-the-bag-meals/) was a common technique. The interesting point about this recipe is that we find [something very similar](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/27/meat-pudding-from-meister-hans/) in the Meister Hans collection: \n\n***Recipe #65*** **f\u00fclle den magen als*****o***\n\n***Fill the stomach thus***\n\n***Item take chopped pork, eggs, cut white bread, fat meat,  pepper, caraway, saffron and salt and temper it all together. Full the  stomach with it not too full and boil it green (raw?). When it is  boiled, loosen the filling from the stomach. Cut it into four pieces and  chop it with eggs (the pronoun here suggests it is the stomach, not the  filling, that gets chopped)***\n\nThe phrasing is very similar, the intended outcome obviously the  same. To all intents and purposes, this is the same recipe, and that  matters. The Meister Hans collection is dated explicitly to 1460, but  the Mondseer recipe collection is bound with a text dated to 1439. That  undercuts the idea that the Meister Hans collection is what it purports  to be, the recipe collection of a master cook. It allows for two or  three possible conclusions: If Meister Hans is a recipe collection  produced by an individual, then the surviving manuscript is a late and  possibly corrupted copy. There is, in fact, a cook by the name of Hans  recorded in the household of Wurttemberg in the early 1400s. If the  collection was produced at that time, would allow for a recipe (in fact,  it is more than one) from it to appear in a separate collection in  1439. Conversely, if Meister Hans is a collection produced in the  typical German style, by mixing and matching recipes from various  sources, then its attribution was faked for an unknown reason. It may  have happened in deliberate imitation of the Viandier of Taillevent, a  recipe collection ascribed (possibly falsely) to [Guillaume Tirel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Tirel), cook to the king of France. We find another recipe collection ascribed to one [Master Eberhard of Landshut](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Meister-Eberhard-translation-revised.pdf)  at the same time that clearly is no such thing. It is, of course,  possible that copying written recipes, possibly in the style of a  loose-leaf binder, was how cooks of the time exchanged and recorded  recipes and this is one that Meister Hans copied from the manuscript  tradition that includes the Mondseer Kochbuch, but I think that is very  unlikely. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.

Take the crawfish  and cut away their eyes, but leave the rest of the crawfish whole and  wash them quite clean. When you have washed them, throw them into a  mortar and pound them very small. When they are half pounded, press them  out with a clean cloth so that their juice passes through it. Then  pound them again very thoroughly. Then take pure milk that is raw and  pour it into the mortar. And (take) the juice that you pressed out  before and pour it in with the first, stir it together, and strain it  cleanly through a sieve. Pour it into boiling milk altogether and it  will congeal. When it has congealed well, pour it out on a clean cloth.  From this same, you can prepare more than one dish. Take it and throw it  into pure butter in a pan and fry (*****r\u00f6st*****) it, thus you have a  pure food. If you wish to have it sweet, take honey and add it, thus it  will be sweet. If you have sugar, you do not need honey. You must not  put the sugar into the pot. When you have prepared the food in the  (serving) bowl, strew it with the sugar. This is how your food is  prepared.***\n\n***87 A cheese of crawfish and milk***\n\n***If you wish to prepare a good cheese of that which is on  the cloth in the other (recipe), take the cloth twofold (i.e. two  layers) and tie it shut and lay it on a table. Lay stones on top of it  and weigh it down well. Untie it, and it is like a cheese. If you want  to serve it whole or if you want to slice it and serve sauce over it,  take bread and toast it, and (take) parsley together with vinegar and  wine, or prepare another sauce with eggs, as you please.***\n\nI freely admit that this recipe is mainly strange to me. It very  likely does not have much to offer in terms of flavour, but the  technique is intriguing. Of course much depends on the unstated facts  here. If we assume a loose cloth and a high proportion of crawfish to  milk, this could be a *Mus* dish consisting mostly of throroughly  mashed crawfish meat, but I don\u2019t think that is the idea. Rather, there  is probably something in the \u2013 for want of a petter word \u2013 crawfish  juice that causes the hot milk to congeal. I do not know enough about  crustacean biology to say what it could be. The process might depend on  denaturing proteins, which would give the liquefied crawfish the same  role that eggs often play in similar \u2018[roast ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/10/roast-milk-from-the-rheinfrankisches-kochbuch/)[milk](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/19/another-roasted-milk-recipe/)\u2018  recipes. That would require a large quantity of crawfish and likely  produce a red colour from cooking particles of the shell that passed  through the cloth. That would be intentional, as[ another recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/28/crawfish-porridge-from-the-inntalkochbuch/) from the [Inntalkochbuch ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Inntalkochbuch.pdf)attests.  Alternatively, there might well be somew kind of enzymatic action at  work that curdles milk protein. I am not suire whether I would want to  try this out, but at this point it has no high priority and I would not  even know where to get raw crawfish. So I will park it in a holding  pattern for a while. \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology.

{"title": "Is it true that food in an unopened container in a landfill (such as hotdogs sealed in the same package from its supermarket life) can survive over 20 years without decomposition? If so, why don't we have any historical foods surviving from centuries ago in air sealed containers?", "selftext": "Yesteday I helped my aunt prepare and store food to be used in my dad's promotion to Colonel in the National Guard Airforce (which took place today). As we were clearing the van before we stored food, my auntie found a bunch package of Chinese meatbuns (the white kind that with soft smooth texture that often comes with a paper sticker under them). My aunt was like \"I bought those 4 months ago and couldn't find it!\". We sadly had to throw it since its obviously now bad. But there was something peculiar about it. Despite being under the hot sun in a vehicle for the whole summer, it did not melt into a liquid pile of goo. Not only that, there was no sign of mould or discoloration and ohter associated things with food spoilage. From what I could smell of it from outside the sealed bag , it did not smell bad at all but had the smell so associated with that kind of white bread the Chinese use for their native cake and bread products. I could not smell the meat inside but the fact I couldn't detect anything typically like rotting meat amazed me so much.\n\nThis reminds me of a project I did in middle school where we had to research stuff related to trash and waste management. Is tumbled upon an article from a major news paper (can't remember the name but its a big brand name in the same league as say New York Times and People Magazine). It said something about unopened hot dog still in their plastic sealed containers being found in landfills from 20 years ago looking like in new considtion without discoloration nor did it have a strong scent that should have been apparent because of being refigerated so long even if its in a unopened package. The article emphasized that along with being in factory condition package, since it was in a garbage bag and hidden so long deep in over 50 feet high of a pile of trrash, it could not get oxygen and thus failed to decompose because no microbes were interating with the food.\n\nThe article was written around 1987 meaning that the aforementioned hotdogs and other trash it was commenting on would have been produced in the 1960s decade, To this day I still could not believe the article's claims despite being written by some big name professor or scientist (might have been both) who's in the field of evironmentalist and was doing some project for a university at the time the article was published..........\n\nBut seeing the Chinese meat buns not change at all despite being unrefigrated and outdoors during the hot summers (in even hotter temperature because it was stuck inside a car trunk the whole time) reminded me about that article.......\n\nNow the first major question since I cannot believe it. Is this all possible that sealed food thrown into the center of a bunch of garbage would not be able to composee due to lack of oxygen and in turn lack of germs and other invisible tiny living things especially if its been thrown inside a tied plastic bag ortrash bag or something similar? I still am having difficulty beleiving this is actually real. Now the second question, how long until the food getst ot the point of disappearing? 6 centuries? A thousand years? 3 milennias? A whole eon of a million years or more? Now last and most of all, if food can survive so long without decomposition for decades, how come we don't have easily perishable food from the mid 1800s or even from World War 1 in a surviving state? Sealing food in a cloth, paper, ardboard, wooden box, and even modern day plastic wrapper seal has been in eistence since the late 19th century. Furthermore landfills were already a thing after the Industrial Revolution with places like N the Northern states having problems with running out of space in some ities and towns because of the heaps of trash piling up already shortly after the American Civil War. Landfills just became more and more as technology advanced before World War 1 at the even of the 1900s. The existing amount of open lands being used to pile more and more trash has boosted up even further after WWII. So I'm wondering why don't we have surviving ground beef hidden in a trash pile in Germany thats been wrapped in a cylander plastic dated container dated from 1922 hidden in some landfill in operation for 90s years? Why aren't there some ancient sausage linked wrapped in paper cloth in early trashbags in a landfill thats been in operation since 1879? Since piels of trash limit oxygen and can cause hotdogs to survive so long for decades, not to mention the Chinese meatbuns in my Auntie's trunks surviving one whole hot summer without decaying into a different state, why don't we have surviving food especially whose in plastic air sealed wraps from the 19th and early 20th centuries in very old landfills?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16ejzpa/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "created_utc": 1694301250.0, "score": 2, "author": "CamelIllustrations", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/16ejzpa/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["First question: Usually the answer is no.

Salt, pepper, and a  little saffron went into the mix which I then stirred three eggs into.  The result was a kind of thick batter.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp5t63wgyolb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ff0668149033af633d27d77ecf7a6b0872bc967\n\n In the meantime, I heated up my mortar. I found this lovely piece of  brass at a flea market two years ago and cleaned it up with wire brushes  and metal polish, and now I finally had the opportunity to use it. Note  I do not recommend actually cooking the dish this way. It is meant as  proof of concept, not as a regular kitchen habit. Having pre-heated the  mortar in a 200\u00b0C oven, I added a dollop of butter. I erred on the side  of caution here \u2013 more would have been better and might have stopped the  cake from sticking. Then I spooned in the batter and returned the  mortar to the oven at 175\u00b0C.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fil3ly6jyolb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0764ae44eb6b15d3e0dae90bc3acf4f5f10ec078\n\n The result was pretty good. It stuck to the sides in a few places which  meant it did not come out as neatly as it was probably supposed to, but  it held together nicely and tasted quite nice. The dish is not a  culinary epiphany \u2013 it reminded me a little of chicken nuggets \u2013 but it  went well with sweet mustard and, later, in a wrap with sliced cucumber,  which is obviously not historical. I guess it should be possible to  replicate it in a cast-iron skillet or something similarly less  problematic.

Take white bread and prepare a thin egg batter. Pound saffron and  pepper. And mix this together, and mix it well in a vat. And take a  mortar with fresh fat and put it in there altogether. Scum it with a  ladle and cover it with a bowl, and frequently turn the mortar against  the fire so that it gets an even heat. Pour off the fat and pour it (the  cooked dish) our into a serving dish and serve it.***\n\nAs a dish, this is not very interesting: Cooked chicken in a spicy  egg batter thickened with  bread gets thrown into a mortar with hot fat.  If you cock your head sideways and squint, this could just barely be  read as a breaded fried chicken, but it is far more likely a variation  on the theme of *M\u00f6rserkuchen*, egg batters fried in heated mortars, that we [find so often](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/29/mortar-cake-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) [in German sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/02/mortar-cakes-from-cod-pal-germ-551/). Interestingly, it looks like a meeting of the standard *M\u00f6rserkuchen* made  with bread and some chicken bits (The K\u00f6nigsberg MS #20 specifies that  livers or feet are fine) and the dish known by the slightly enigmatic  name of *kungs huner* that does specify not add bread at all. We have at least two [parallel ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/21/mortar-fried-chicken-from-the-konigsberg-ms/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/02/kungs-huner-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)for the latter, again from the [K\u00f6nigsberg MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Konigsberg-Manuscript.pdf) and [Heidelberg Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf).  It is possible that the difference in spicing \u2013 ginger in the latter  recipes versus saffron and pepper in the Mondseer Kochbuch \u2013 may have  been what distinguished *kungs huner* as such, but I doubt it.  Certainly, given the degree to which the two sources depend on a shared  tradition, I would want to see independent verification that ginger  belongs in that dish.   \n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.  Many of its recipes are complex and call for expensive ingredients, and  some give unusually precise quantities and measurements. It is edited  in Doris Aichholzer\u2019s \u201cWildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201d Drei  mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Edition, \u00dcbersetzung, Quellenkommentar,  Peter Lang, Berne et al. 1999", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1664940/chicken_in_a_mortar_c_1440/", "created_utc": 1693467060.0, "score": 2, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/1664940/chicken_in_a_mortar_c_1440/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

These are a thoroughly interesting class of food, and they appear quite frequently [in the German recipe corpus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/21/italian-influence-in-the-innsbruck-ms/) from the fifteenth century onwards. The most famous example known today, of course, is the [*Maultasche* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maultasche)of  Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a large meat dumpling usually served in broth. Its  name appears to predate its introduction and originally may have meant a  slap to the face, though how this relates to the food is hard to see.  They are certainly delicious if you can get good ones, and that takes me  to today\u2019s blog post.  \n\n Germany, especially the south, has a great depth of regional food  tradition that would take years to fully explore, but it is rarely  married to the same fierce loyalty and business acumen that you see in  France or Italy. Often enough, finding such specialties can be  diffiocult unless you are willing to brave the most touristified venues.  However, you can very frequently get lucky in the most plebeian of  places. We had such a stroke of luck at the [tram museum in Stuttgart](https://www.ssb-ag.de/erleben/strassenbahnmuseum-stuttgart/). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Vintage tram rides every Sunday](https://preview.redd.it/d9ib93xxnyeb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec14aa20f4b4fd1847ff82676693685a4bdd4c8d)\n\n Stuttgart is  interesting in all kinds of ways, and one notable aspect  is the pride peopler take in their public transit. I already wrote of  the [funiculars that they maintain](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/24/travel-postcard-and-a-new-rabbit-hole/)  as part of the regular network. The tram museum is another such  example. Funded in part by the transit provider and staffed by  enthusiastic volunteers, it is a wonderful example of many such places  throughout Germany, though on an unusually large scale. And, like many  such places, it has an eating place \u2013 the Bistro Meterspur. \n\n \n\n[Simplicity itself](https://preview.redd.it/4g5p2rc1oyeb1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfe995ebd31657bf4b37c6da2087ff5ddfbed12d)\n\n It is not the place you would immediately feel attracted to. The decor  is institutionally spartan \u2013 I think it used to be the works canteen  when the building was a tram depot \u2013 and the menu very limited. Since we  had two young hoys with us and they were hungry, we decided it was our  best option. Flammkuchen and Maultaschen were ordered and served quickly  in the unfussy way of a place that still seems to remember feeding  mechanics and drivers in its bricks and tabletops.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[S\u00fctterlin - the secret handshake of history nerds](https://preview.redd.it/3jmcs9t4oyeb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2640f1eda0f41750e9dc7b61ee9cee12bf32f278)\n\n It was good. Really, really good. The Maultaschen were hot,  well-seasoned and rich enough to stand on their own as they should. The  Flammkuchen was thin and crisp, the bottom browned perfectly without  burning, the top just about cooked. Since we had the abovementioned boys  with us, there are no photographs of the food as it was  served, but  the  visual presentation was not really the point. It was good eating. I  am certain the sausages \u2013 the third option on the menu \u2013 would also  have been excellent. Our meal was accompanied by [locally made lemonades ](https://suedkola.de/)and finished with [also locally produced ice cream](http://www.eisberg-stuttgart.de/).  This, by the way, is a good guideline to follow. Any place that  contracts with local, artisanal suppliers of  beverages or ice cream  cares about quality. Germany has hundreds such local firms, and they  survive on the merits of their product. \n\nThe point I want to make here is that when you are travelling in  Germany, you can usually find someplace that serves local specialties,  looks like Walt Disney\u2019s idea of a cuckoo clock, and charges you an arm  and a leg. But if you keep your eyes open and trust your luck, you can  also find the offbeat places where people with a passion for doing  things right (how very German) produce excellent local food at  affordable prices.  The language barriers can be higher \u2013 even for  German speakers, dialect is not immediately intelligible \u2013 but the  rewards can be very much worth it.

I\u2019m back travelling in the Rhine-Neckar area with my son, visiting  new places and revisiting old favourites. Since he loves railways, that  is our focus, but I am also bringing back some culinary material. \n\nAnd again, this should come with a few travel tips. I mentioned railways, let us talk about different approaches to heritage:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Heidelberg cable cars](https://preview.redd.it/ptt986bkvudb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13c0675c5e0960e08512e2ea6151835ac30a4685)\n\n There are functioning cable funiculars (*Standseilbahnen*) in both [Heidelberg ](https://www.bergbahn-heidelberg.de/)and [Stuttgart](https://www.vvs.de/freizeit/detailansicht/stuttgarter-standseilbahn/173).  The one in Heidelberg is world-famous. Lovingly restored, it caters to  the tourist trade, bringing crowds to the local beauty spot of  K\u00f6nigstuhl to enjoy a spectacular view of the area. Tickets are quite  pricey, but you get a ride in an actual functioning cable car from the  1900s.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Stuttgart cable car](https://preview.redd.it/aivlqy8vvudb1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6b07ae0e95c00d796f3dc76cb0c95e212d2c08a)\n\n The one in Stuttgart is a little younger, just appoaching its 100th  birthday, and you need to do a bit of walking to get to the lookout  point. But on the upside, it is also a fully functioning funicular  operating original cars from the 1920s, and it is part of the regular  public transit system. That means you can step out of the U-Bahn, sit  down on a hardwood bench in a wood-panelled, brass-fixtured interior,  and ride to your heart\u2019s content. If you have a day pass or, as we do, a  [*Deutschlandticket*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschlandticket), it\u2019s free. So, by the way, is the other funicular in the city, a [*Zahnradbahn* ](https://www.ssb-ag.de/unternehmen/informationen-fakten/fahrzeuge/zahnradbahn/)running spiffy modern trains with flatcars for bicycles. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhh1qqc4wudb1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0aded29306db6636eac9ceb7c2b36c10aa836620\n\n This is not a question about which is better. Both were great  experiences. You get something for your money in Heidelberg \u2013 looks at  the restored engine room, lots of historic documentation, service, and  the amazing view. But Stuttgarters love that these trains are features  of their daily lives still.  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pbn4q2o2wudb1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07b0979f3f24660a06506855904ff9f4300fcee8\n\nI mentioned a rabbit hole, but it is actually two. One is the renewed experience of Germany\u2019s [youth hostel ](https://www.jugendherberge.de/en/)cuisine.  I love the Jugendherbergen (full disclosure: I am a member of the  association, but receive no benefit or remuneration for writing about  them) and happily stay there whe travelling. This time, between stays in  [Heidelberg ](https://www.jugendherberge.de/en/youth-hostels/heidelberg/portrait/)and [Stuttgart](https://www.jugendherberge.de/en/youth-hostels/stuttgart-international/portrait/), I went back to one of my absolute favourites, [Speyer](https://www.jugendherberge.de/en/youth-hostels/speyer/portrait/), whose breakfast buffet I [eulogised in an earlier post](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/07/on-tech-vacations-and-pfalzer-breakfast-virtues/).  My son, who is a more clear-eyed critic than me, said that in  Heidelberg, the food was good, but the room was not while in Stuttgart,  it was the reverse. In Speyer, though, both were excellent. The latter  is absolutely true.  And I was surprised to find that while some hostels  produce [recipe booklets](https://merendinabloggt.wordpress.com/2012/01/22/leckere-spaghetti-rezepte-jugendherbergen-kochbuch-12498756/) or even[ feature their kitchens online](https://www.jugendherberge.de/nordsee-sauerland/zuhause/kochen-mit-micha/), there is no published resource on hostel cuisine. Since organised school trips \u2013 *Klassenreisen* \u2013  traditionally useyouth hostels, the experience is central to the  memories of many Germans, and that may well be a project worth  undertaking. I have no idea if I will ever be able to write the *Jugendherbergs-Kochbuch*, but it really ought to be done.\n\nMore on the other rabbit hole to follow.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15828ed/travel_postcard/", "created_utc": 1690179791.0, "score": 2, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/CulinaryHistory/comments/15828ed/travel_postcard/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

These are two variations of the common bean that were already present in the Caribbean region for thousands of years.\n\nThe final major legume and rice dish of major culinary importance is dhal and rice, a dish that uses a type of legume introduced from India.\r  \n\r  \nIn India, dhal is a term used for several flat legumes, some of which are lentils while others are peas that have been split into two pieces. These peas were split to facilitate faster cooking times, and better absorption of water. Food writer Colleen Taylor Sen says that dhal \u201cmay be the closest India has to a national dish\u201d due to how prevalent it has always been in the cuisine of the sub-continent. Dhal came to the Caribbean as a food supply for the [Indian Indentured laborers](https://quadtt.com/indian-indentureship-in-the-caribbean/) who replaced the slaves in several parts of the West Indies. Ship logs indicate that rations for the Indians on their journey to the Caribbean included dhal, rice, onions, garlic, ghee, and turmeric; ingredients still used to make dhal and rice in Trinidad, Jamaica, and Guyana today. Several types of dhal were historically used in the Caribbean, including split urad bean, and split mung bean, but it has largely since settled on yellow dhal made from split pigeon peas. This dhal is used in a type of roti called a dhalpuri, as well as dishes like pholourie, and dhal and rice.\n\n[The dhal for dhal and rice](https://tastetrinbago.com/how-to-make-dhal/) is boiled, blended with a swizzle stick, and then cooked with cumin, turmeric, and garlic. It is possible to find dhal and rice in restaurants in the English speaking Caribbean, but it is rarely cooked in homes except in places with a significant East Indian population. It has not become as widely accepted as other Indian dishes like dhalpuri roti or curry goat and likely never will, since it has to compete with so many other Caribbean rice and legume dishes that are more well established. Another way of cooking dhal and rice in the Caribbean is a dish called [kitchree or kitcharee](https://tastetrinbago.com/kitchree-recipe-dhal-cooked-up-rice/), which is a type of dhal and rice cooked up with turmeric, onions, garlic, and cumin. The popularity of this dish in India was described by the Macedonian general Seleucus I Nicator over two thousand years ago. The Caribbean version is typically made with less dhal than in India, and often consumed with [curried seafood](https://tastetrinbago.com/trini-curry-shrimp-recipe-by-chef-jeremy-lovell/) and coconut chutney.\n\nIn Trinidad, there are two dhal and rice dishes that are uncommon enough that many Trinidadians have never sampled either. One is a countryside tradition of cooking dhal with callaloo ingredients in the same pot. The resulting dish is a hearty and nutritious soup known as [dhalaloo](https://youtu.be/lZUoP2MCVoI). The other is a North Indian dish called rice and karhi. [Karhi](https://youtu.be/9Zp77kz6UKM) is a creamy gravy made with split peas flour. Fritters made with split peas flour are added to this gravy, and then the mixture is poured over white rice. The former is rare because it is generally made by outdoorsmen during the hunting season, and the latter is rare because it is only made at ceremonies like Hindu Weddings and not available at roti shops."]}

The first two are ancestors  of the way frog legs are still prepared in France, floured and fried.  The next three are fairly typical of the way small meats are prepared in  Germany in the sixteenth century; in an apple sauce, a bread-thickened  wine sauce, or with almonds. I am not certain whether the final two  describe a kind of scrambled eggs with frog meat or a sauce bound with  egg yolk. Certainly they all fit the style of their day, and it looks  like frogs are basically considered meat, though not a favoured kind. \n\nFranz de Rontzier, head cook to the bishop of Halberstadt and duke of Braunschweig, published his encyclopaedic *Kunstbuch von mancherley Essen* in 1598. He clearly looks to Marx Rumpolt\u2019s *New Kochbuch*  as the new gold standard, but fails to match it in engaging style or  depth. He is thus overshadowed by the twin peaks of Marx Rumpolt and  Anna Wecker. What makes his work interesting is the way in which he  systematically lists versions of a class of dishes, illustrating the  breadth or a court cook\u2019s repertoire. He is also more modernly  fashionable than Rumpolt.

Truss it and stick it half with cloves  and then sprinkle bacon with salt and wrap it around it with paper over  it. Let it cook slowly and baste it with drippings, and sprinkle it with  salt when you wish to serve it.***\n\n***2 Item roast the turkey plain. Then boil cubed toasted  bread, cinnamon, sugar, and small raisins in red wine, but do not let it  boil for long. Place it in a silver dish, lay the turkey on it, strew  it with sugar-coated cloves and serve it cold or warm etc.***\n\n***3 Item you fry three or four apples and onions in butter,  stir (scramble) it with three or four eggs and chop it with the fat of  the turkey, pepper, ginger, mace, and sugar. Then you stick three or  four hard-boiled eggs with cloves, mix them into this and fill the  turkey with that. Roast it and baste it with drippings, and sprinkle it  with salt when you wish to serve it.***\n\n***4 Item chop scrambled eggs, white bread, gooseberries (*****stichbirn*****),  nutmeg, ginger, saffron, sugar, and a little salt together. Fill the  turkey with that and roast it, and when it is done, put gooseberries and  butter into a pan and make them boil up, then pour it over the turkey  and sprinkle it with sugar etc.***\n\n***5 Item you roast it plain and baste it with butter. Then  you pour beef broth over toasted white bread, lay the turkey on this  together with marrowbones, and let it cook together.***\n\n***6 Item you lard half the bird with bacon and stick the  other half with cloves. When it is half cooked, lay toasted bread in a  silver dish, pour beef broth and drippings over it, strew it witzh  pepper, let it boil up on the coals, put the turkey on top of it and  then serve it etc.***\n\n***7 Item you brown it over the coals. Then you lay thinly  sliced bacon on a table and cut a few bitter oranges into thin slices.  Lay those on the bacon. Mix white bread, two or three eggs, sugar,  pounded ginger and nutmeg, and spread it on the bacon with a knife.  Sprinkle it with salt and wrap it around the turkey. Let it cook until  it is well done. Mix dripping, sugar, and rosewater, and pour that over  it when you wish to serve it, and strew it with sugar etc.***\n\n***8 Item you roast a turkey and when it is done, you pour  over butter and sprinkle it with salt. Boil white bread in wine and  press out the wine again and mix it with rosewater, egg, sugar, and  salt. Baste it gently while you turn it, thus it will be coated with the  mixture. Sprinkle it with salt and serve it etc.***\n\n(p. 214-216)\n\nThese are not unusual ways of cooking poultry in sixteenth-century  Germany, though they are very luxurious. Fashionable ingredients like  bitter oranges, rosewater, spices, and sugar elevate the already  exclusive roast turkey to courtly standing. Again, we see the familiar  pattern playing out: A New World ingredient fits into a known culinary  slot and is treated like a familiar one. It is very rare for foreign  techniques to be adopted along with foreign  livestock or plants in  Western Europe. \n\nFranz de Rontzier, head cook to the bishop of Halberstadt and duke of Braunschweig, published his encyclopaedic *Kunstbuch von mancherley Essen* in 1598.

{"title": "Liver in a Caul - Sixteenth Century Cooking Technique", "selftext": " [https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/15/another-liver-in-a-caul-recipe/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/12/15/another-liver-in-a-caul-recipe/) \n\nLife continues to throw stuff my way, so I apologise for missing  another day. Today, there is only a short and familiar recipe from the  Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch:\n\n***37 To Roast Calf Liver***\n\n***Boil the liver and salt it. When it has boiled, chop it  very small and put it in a bowl. Break eggs into it and pour in hot fat  (brenn schmalz daran) and stir it well together. Or take bacon and chop  it into that in place of the fat. Season it nicely and colour it yellow,  and also take Rosinlein and Weynberlein. Add them, and do not make it  too thin with the eggs. Then place it in a caul (netzlein) and sew the  caul shut so the liver does not escape. Take a pot, place a lid  (sturtzen) on it, lay small pieces of wood (hoeltzlein) on the lid. If  you have bacon slices (specklein), you may place them on the wood so the  liver does not stick to them. Then lay the liver on them and set the  pot into the oven by the fire, and see to the oven that it does not  burn, thus it will be nicely crisp (roesch) and good.***\n\nLiver roasted in a caul is avery common dish across the German corpus, with similar recipes occurring in [Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/29/two-sausage-recipes-from-cgm-384-ii/), [Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/09/22/a-stuffed-liver-roasted-in-a-caul-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/), the [K\u00f6nigsberg MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/16/liver-wrapped-in-caul-from-the-konigsberg-ms/), and [Meister Eberhard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/08/12/liver-roasted-in-caul-from-meister-eberhard/).  The process is always similar: The liver is parboiled, chopped, mixed  with eggs, seasoned, and has raisins added. It is then wrapped in a caul  and cooked. What makes this particular recipe interesting is the  technique. Instead of roasting it on a griddle, it is here carefully  rested on skewers laid across the inverted lid of a pot with bacon  slices put under it to prevent it from sticking. The entire description  speaks to the skill and experience of the cook. It is then cooked in an  Ofen. These ovens were not primarily baking ovens, but designed to heat a  room, and were used to cook while the fire was burning inside them.  This method was both economical and elegant.  \n\nThe short Kuenstlichs und Fuertrefflichs Kochbuch was first printed  in Augsburg in 1559 and reprinted in Nuremberg in 1560 and subsequently.  Despite its brevity, it is interesting especially as it contains many  recipes for *k\u00fcchlein*, baked or deep-fried confections, that  apparently played a significant role in displaying status.

Refilling eggshells was a common conceit  in the recipe books and no doubt must have been done in reality to show  off the skills of a cook. The name, here *kro\u00df ayer*, is hard to interpret. It may refer to the fact that being filled, they have \u2018intestines\u2019 (*Gekr\u00f6se*).

Also cut apples thus and also fry them in fat and also serve them on spoon dishes (*****mue\u00dfern*****) in Lent.***\n\nLenten dishes that simulate meat are very common in German recipe  collections from the fifteenth century, and they often use high-status  ingredients like almonds, fresh fish, sugar, spices, and imported dried  fruit. these two are not atypical, but especially the latter is  interesting.\n\n\\#58 seems designed to simulate a fried dish of chopped meat, either meant to be served as it is or used in cooking. A *Geh\u00e4ck* is mentioned, among other things, as a filling for *krapfen* fritters.  The word itself just means something that is chopped, but here it is  clear that a more specific reference is intended. Chopped almonds,  possibly actually coated with the sugar in the pan, and softened raisins  together would certainly make an attractive combination.\n\nBy contrast, #59 uses inexpensive ingredients to produce mock cracklings, the *Grieben* that are still thoroughly entrenched in rural German cookery. The first option is basically croutons, and *Brotw\u00fcrfel*,  cubed soft bread fried in butter, are still popular with winter soups  to this day. The second, using fried apples, is more exotic, but also  likely to be tasty. Here, we also learn that *Mus* dishes were commonly served topped with cracklings. that should add an interesting touch to contemporary medieval tables.\n\nBound together with medicinal, veterinary, and magical texts, the  culinary recipes of Munich Cgm 384 were partly published in 1865 as \u201cEin  alemannisches B\u00fcchlein von guter Speise\u201c.

The larger bars may have a small section if not separate room for dancing and at least in bigger towns and within the city hookah pipes are also pretty common.

Don't get me started on multiple TVs featuring sporting events and how many of them also offer regular food including actual cooked meals. Some might even have a DJ playing around with vinyls and CDs. Hell gambling machines have started being placed in bars too more and more frequently.\n\nSo I gotta ask.

Grind (make) it with vinegar and  with broth (s\u00f6de) so it does not become too sour, and pour it  on the condiment. Add fat and let it warm up, and take it up before it  becomes too thick and serve it.***\n\nInnards were commonly eaten, so this was likely a commonplace dish.  The sauce with its mixture of herbs and vinegar sounds like it could be  appealing, though I am leery of the large quantity of caraway.  Altogether, I think I want to try this once, but I am not certain I am  likely to enjoy it.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely. The entire codex  was bound in leather in the second half of the fifteenth century, so at  this point the recipe collection must have been part of it. The book was  held at the monastery until it passed into the Vienna court library,  now the national library of Austria, where it is now Cod 4995.\n\nThe collection shows clear parallels with the *Buoch von guoter Spise*.

{"title": "Whey Blanc Manger, or a Spelling Error?", "selftext": "[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/12/a-misspelling-or-whey-blanc-manger/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/12/a-misspelling-or-whey-blanc-manger/)\n\nAnother recipe from the Mondseer Kochbuch, short because I am travelling again:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oiy3gmyl4qhb1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7c33b01978c6f2df1958db296e45ec0a58c8f73\n\n***3 A side dish of whey (zigermilch \u2013 or goat milk?), almonds, rice flour, and chickens***\n\n***You should take whey (or goats\u2019*** ***milk)*** ***and make almond milk (mandels) \u00bd libra. You should pound a*** **vierdung** ***of  rice to powder and put it into the milk while it is cold. And take the  breast of a chicken, and you should tear up and chop it into that. And  you should take clean fat and add it, and it is to boil in this. Add a*** **vierdung** ***of sugar.***\n\nThis is possibly a very interesting recipe, but it could just as well  be evidence of a miscommunication. As it is written, it describes a  variation on the popular blanc manger, a dish of almond milk, rice  flour, and meat or occasionally fish. The term *ziger* referred to [varieties of cheese](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/27/almond-cheese-from-cgm-384-ii/) [eaten fresh](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/05/almond-cheeses-from-the-innsbruck-ms/),  often produced in the household, so the whey from that process would  have been available in many kitchens. That is why Aichholzer reads *zigermilch* as whey.\n\nHowever, the recipe is also a fairly close parallel of one found in the [Buoch von Guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise), an earlier source. Here, the dish is identified by name, and the ingredient in question is *zigenin milch* \u2013 goats\u2019 milk.\n\n***(2) If you wish to prepare a*** **blamensier**\n\n***How you should prepare a*** **blamenser**. ***You should take goats\u2019 milk (******zigenin milich******) and prepare almond milk (******mandels******)  half a pound. You should pound a vierdung of rice to flour, and put  that into the milk (while it is) cold. Take a chicken breast, and you  should tear up and chop it into that. And you should add clean fat and  let it boil in that. And use enough of it (******gibs im genuc******) Then take it up again and take pounded violets and put them in. And add a*** **vierdung** ***of sugar and serve it. You can also prepare a*** **blamenser** ***of pike in Lent.***\n\nMuch as I would love to experiment with whey, I think this is the  better explanation. It also throws some light on the way recipe  collections circulated in Germany. The Mondseer Kochbuch has many  parallels with the Buoch von Guoter Spise, but they are not adapted as  one block. Rather, they are found throughout the text and not always in  the order they are in the earlier text. The garbling that seems to have  occurred here (and on several other occasions) suggests that the  Mondseer Kochbuch is derivative of the earlier work, though the process  remains somewhat obscure. It is fairly clear, though, that the text was  not simply copied from the page. Culinary recipes seem to have  circulated as building blocks of collections that were made for or by  individuals, not as canonical texts.\n\nThe Mondseer Kochbuch is a recipe collection bound with a set of  manuscript texts on grammar, dietetics, wine, and theology. There is a  note inside that part of the book was completed in 1439 and, in a  different place, that it was gifted to the abbot of the monastery at  Mondsee (Austria). It is not certain whether the manuscript already  included the recipes at that point, but it is likely.

Would be nifty though if such a slang had maintained for so long. But it does seem that gossip with tea has had a long enough association to imagine it taking that modern sense way earlier, and still seem sensible to the time ; perhaps if it is older than the 90's, nobody was writing it down before then for us to know about now.", "They forgot about \u2018Oysters vs Snails\u2019 scene from Spartacus"]}
