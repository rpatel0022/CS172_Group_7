She'll play around with her own take on things, like combining two traditional recipes into one, or converting the sabich sandwich to a sabich salad. Is a good option if you want one book that covers a fair amount of ground in the Middle East while emphasizing Lebanese food - includes dishes from Syria, Palestine, Iran and more.\n\n* **Levant** by Rawia Bishara - *Middle Eastern, especially Palestinian* - A Palestinian woman who opened her Middle Eastern restaurant in NYC, the author said that opening her restaurant *\"called on me to venture beyond the traditional and expected to shape an entirely new cuisine, one that is sophisticated but still relates to the classic Middle Eastern kitchen.\"* So, much like the last book, you'll see a number of traditional recipes, but even more that are a modern and delicious creation. This comes out in dishes like her fall fattoush and portobello shawarma. Her coriander green beans with almond is my favorite green bean dish, by far.\n\n* **Zaitoun** by Yasmin Khan - *Palestinian* - This is a beautiful and delightful book. I think Nigella Lawson said it well: *\"Yasmin Khan is a human rights campaigner and storyteller as well as a recipe writer, and the three strands of her work are illuminatingly woven into this, her new book, Zaitoun, an important collection of recipes and stories from the Palestinian kitchen.\"* The author herself says of the recipes, *\"Some are classic dishes taught to me by Palestinian grandmothers; others are my interpretations of meals I ate in restaurants or at the homes of friends; others still are simply inspired by a local ingredient or technique.\"* I've made several of the dishes from here and loved each of them, and think this book is an approachable collection that may have more easier dishes than some of the others, even. Also just found a soup that I'm going to make after finishing this comment, actually.\n\n* **Falestin** by Sami Tamimi and Tara Wigley - *Palestinian* - Okay, won't say too much here since I've only made one dish from this so far, but that was delicious, and I know Tamimi from the next book, so fully trust him. Has also gotten rave reviews from others.\n\n* **Jerusalem** by Yoyam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi - *Israeli/Palestinian* - This books speaks to some of the interplay between the two cultures that live in Jerusalem, with each of the authors coming from a different side. They deliberately dont cover much of the political and social tension that is well known, but focus on the foods that are eaten throughout the city by one or both sides. Again, delicious, and has some real projects alongside simpler recipes. One of these days I'll make the chocolate krantz cakes I've been eyeing for years... This book is one that I'd love to focus on, read cover to cover. \n\nIn addition, some other authors to look into that I don't know as well would be Alissa Helou, Claudia Roden, May Bsisu, and Reem Kassis.", "Try Ottolenghi, guy is Libanese born and many recipes are Libanese inspired. Also, his recipes are really good, easy to read, good descriptions of what you need to do when.

Very good recipes, and they include lots of context/notes to help you get them right. \n\nI also have cooked from \u201cThe Lebanese Kitchen\u201d by Salma Hage. The illustrations are beautiful and the coverage is expansive, but I find you have to already know a lot to cook from it well \u2014 it does not give as much context/notes as other books do.", "\"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean\" by Paula Wolfert", "\"Offal\" by Anissa Helou. You'll find there authentic Lebanese recipes not just from offal.", "In addition to some of the other recommendations here, check out:\n\nSuqar by Greg and Lucy Malouf (for inspiring desserts) and Sirocco by Sabrina Ghayour (for easy to execute recipes). \n\nAlso, if you are into Turkish food, I adore The Turkish Cookbook by Musa Da\u011fdeviren (for restaurant-quality Turkish food).", "Just got Eating Out Loud and it\u2019s beautiful, can\u2019t wait to start making some recipes from it."]}

In my opinion it is the definitive book for New American cuisine, and as a result of it's location, California cuisine.", "so here's what I would do:\n\nstart by grabbing a copy of Jeremiah Tower's New Amerian Classics.  Tower worked at Chez Panisse for a number of years during the 1970s and had a hand in defining the burgeoning California cuisine style.  Afterward, he went on to open his own restaurant.  The cookbook I recommended gives you a glimpse into what California cuisine looked like in the mid-80s.  Black bean soup with crema!  If you want to really go to the source, I  suppose you COULD buy some Chez Panisse cookbooks, but I don't think the earliest was published until the early 1990s.  Having said that, Chez Panisse Cooking is written by Paul Bertolli and he's legendary.  \n\nFast forward 10 years and grab the The French Laundry cookbook.  Thomas Keller is a legend and I don't need to say anything else about him or his New American cuisine.\r  \n\r  \nAlso from the mid-90s, I would recommend The Food of Campanile.  Campanile was a restaurant in Los Angeles which sorta did a Cal-Mediterranean thing.  Tons of chefs trained at Campanile and, along with Wolfgang Puck, sorta helped mold upper-mid dining in L.A. for a while.  \r  \n\r  \nFrom the mid-90s on, there are so, so many books I could recommend.  Cookbooks became crazy popular and it seemed like everyone was writing a book.  However, I might recommend Manresa: An Edible Reflection by David Kinch.  Kinch takes the farm-to-table, local ethos on which California cuisine was founded and pushes it through his very personal lens.  He's a massively gifted chef and the book itself is gorgeous and a fun read.", "That\u2019s pretty broad-what kinds of things were you looking for?"]}

{"title": "Review of \u201cBaking with Dorie\u201d", "selftext": "Review of \u201cBaking with Dorie\u201d by Dorie Greenspan (cross post)\n\nThis book was released last night, so this is a first read not a recipe tested review. [Cover Image](https://images.app.goo.gl/m56Vm86DUebK23tv5)\n\n\n[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/035822358X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_QG9ZP77MZ3X5SEVRBYKT)\n\n**Its rare to find a cookbook written this well**\n\nI knew nothing of Dorie Greenspan prior to reading this book other than she has written a number of well reviewed and highly acclaimed cookbooks. It turns out that \u201cnumber\u201d is now 14 and it represents 30 years of cookbookery, as she calls it. That\u2019s thirty years of experience in teaching us to cook bake and delight in the wonders of food. In reading this book I\u2019m impressed, this book stands out as exceptional in its detail and thorough explanations, it has a fluid style and well done photos..though other books do surpass this one if judging by photos alone in my opinion (for instance I don\u2019t know how to braid and I don\u2019t think from the photos alone I would quite feel comfortable doing it without checking another source). But to be clear this book overall is excellent in terms of photography as well. In the 14 books and 30 years she has mastered her craft but the most extraordinary thing is she maintains a joyful enthusiasm, curiosity and even playfulness that brings life into the creations she shared with us. Her passion for baking is infectious and has me excited to jump into the kitchen and start baking too. I\u2019m going to start with one of the breads and report back in a day or two.\n\nHere is an example of how well written her instructions are. This is her describing how to griddle cook English muffins: \u201c You want it to reach 350 degrees F. Measure the temperature with a thermometer gun or test it by holding your hand about 5 inches above the griddle\u2014if you can keep it there comfortably for 3 to 4 seconds, you should be good.\u201d She comes at it from multiple ways to help you get the best result with detailed knowledge \u201c350F\u201d (rarely do I see an IR thermometer temp for a griddle BRAVO, most say \u201cmedium heat\u201d) but also how you can get a good result out without buying fancy tools. Am I the only one totally floored by how amazing this is? I love this.\n\nThe book is 400 pages divided into seven recipe sections including both sweet and savory fare. The focus is recipes that are simple, rely on basic techniques and have deep flavors and complex textures. They are designed to be flexible so you can modify and play with them. And we are promised that each and every recipe has been thoroughly tested. She provides both weight and volume measurements and has tested the recipes both ways. This is a true rarity where often you find inconsistent or dubious conversions used between weight and volume measures even in high end cookbooks from respected sources. It\u2019s pretty clear Dorie takes recipe testing seriously and goes above and beyond to ensure you get a reliable recipe and a good result. Not only do you get highly detailed instructions (weights and volumes both included with both metric and imperial units) and well described ingredients (eg fine sea salt instead of just \u201csalt\u201d which if lazily described as salt like many authors do would lead up to a 3x difference in saltiness). She offers sage counsel sharing her vast experience with you in every recipe, giving you a heads up about what to expect or what to watch out for. For instance: For a brioche recipe that calls for you to make 2 loaves at once \u201cBecause you get better texture and rise when you\u2019re working with a generous amount of dough, it\u2019s best not to cut the recipe down. Prepare the full recipe\u201d. She Includes guidelines on storage and how long it will last stored in each condition.\n\nList of Recipes:\n\n*Dorie\u2019s favorites\n\u2014 variations of a given recipe\n\n**Breakfast Great Starts

Esau quite willingly sold his birthright for a bowl of lentil soup.\n\nBeefsteak: A steak eater can find no actual words to describe his animal delight. When a man eats fried chicken, he can stop between the second join and the thigh to exclaim, \"Superb!\" ... But a beefsteak eater is a silent man. A steak is no more conductive to conversation than the act of love.\n\nSauces: \"Cooking and roasting are things to teach,\" said Brillat-Savarin; \"it needs a genius to make a sauce.\"\n\nEvery chapter has introductions like this that make you crave to run out and not only prepare every recipe but to read them, relish them, be inspired by them.\n\nOld school, but still my personal favorite (and I have a LOT of loved cookbooks).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/k1qcsx/my_first_cookbook_introduction_to_a_lifelong_love/", "created_utc": 1606435191.0, "score": 12, "author": "DenraelLeandros", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/k1qcsx/my_first_cookbook_introduction_to_a_lifelong_love/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

My favorite for this purpose is Jamie's Food Revolution, because it is literally geared towards people who are just learning to cook and rather unsure of themselves.  \n\n\nAlso second Mark Bittman's \"How to Cook Everything\"- but it is a large, impressive tome so it can be a little intimidating. He has released one appended \"The Basics\" that's pretty solid, if a little French/Western focused. (Granted, French is the cornerstone of most culinary arts training, but it is by no means the simplest to learn.)  \n\n\nBut before you cook anything! Watch some videos on mise en place and knife skills. They will help make everything easier. Worst Cooks in America goes over this every season so I'm sure there's a compilation video on YouTube somewhere.  \n\n\nI used to teach cooking classes and was often asked this question. Here are my go-to suggestions besides the ones above:  \n1. Anything by Jack Monroe- she was a single mum, disabled, living on nothing, when she started writing recipes. She started cooking out of necessity so most of her recipes are cheaper, and easier, but still quite tasty. A Girl Called Jack is my favorite.\n\n2. Cook's Illustrated Cookbook- this is a big boi, but if you were to only have one cookbook, this is the one.   \n3. Cook Like a Rockstar by Anne Burrell- some of the ingredients look intimidating, but she is fabulous at talking you down. This is for moderate beginners, but I think with a little confidence, anyone could cook from this book. And the recipes have levels!  \n4. Umami Bomb- again, scary ingredients, easy techniques. And I haven't made a bad meal from it yet!   \n5. Milk Street Tuesday Nights- the guy that used to run Cook's Illustrated and America's Test Kitchen (two institutions known for testing their recipes into the ground, thus the other recommendation for them- also good, if a little stale in presentation) decided to start his own outfit that moved away from French/Western cuisine and is taking a more worldly approach. Tuesday Nights is the culmination of that effort and trying to find easier and time-saving approaches. This is another moderate beginner recommendation, but it is a fantastic resource.   \n\n\nGood luck!

What publishers are picking up on is something we have known all along: eating is not just something we do to survive, it is an experience. A connection to our food is important to us - its what makes us interested in learning about where our food comes from (slow food, farm to table movements, etc); or, why we care so much about preparation or presentation of the food on our plate; or, trying to preserve our heritage and connect with our past by learning about how dishes used to be prepared. \n\nI don't mean to wax poetic here, but I think these cookbooks are filling a niche in our culinary sides that we may not have even realized we wanted - and all the photos, stories, pictures shouldn't be a bad thing.\n\nExcept for celebrity chefs. I will never buy a book just because some celebrity thinks its awesome.", "The last cookbook I purchased has no pictures.  I find myself wishing it did.  Though the recipes are good, when cooked properly, the way they are written requires the reader to do a lot of guesswork.  \nIn several of the recipes it says to \"chop,\" \"cube,\" or \"slice\" without specifying size.  A cook might be able to make an exquisite dish, but still not fully capable of describing how to do so in writing.  A picture can help fill in information the author fails to provide.  \n", "Please... this trend of lamenting trends in cooking and food because they're not \"traditional\" or the way things used to be done - it's got to stop.\n\nCookbooks have a very wide range of substance, and cookbooks with easy home recipes are still selling, there's no doubt about that. Every time I'm in a bookstore, I see everybody reaching for \"300 soups in 15 minutes\" or \"cook out of a can for your kids with style\" etc... While the Alinea, Noma, and The Fat Duck cookbooks get passed over regularly. \n\nWhat these coffee-table cookbooks do is exactly the same thing as the architecture books just around the corner. They are there as a record of what is going on in the best restaurants in the world. Can you make an Alinea cookbook that the average home cook will be able to cook out of? Of course not, and why would you want to. There's no sense in dumbing the recipes down for everyone. They're for looking and discovering just how complex it is to produce such food. \n\nNow, I've also go to take exception to the article in particular. The author laments such modern cooking as \"fake food\". I've been to Alinea, and I've been to some of the best \"real food\" places this country has to offer. There is absolutely nothing \"fake\" about what's done in modern cooking. The ingredients used in most of these high end places is coming from the world's best producers and purveyors of product. They stay seasonal, they care about what they serve. There's nothing \"fake\" about it. The powders that are used to manipulate the texture of food are derived from food products - corn, seaweed, etc..\n\nF this author for perpetuating the notion that things must be done a certain way, or else it's wrong. It's very much the other way around - \"traditional\", \"farm to table\", \"rustic\", \"real food\", \"sustainable\", \"slow food\" are the bullshit buzzwords now, yet modern food gets a bad wrap. I can count the true \"farm to table\" restaurants in the US on my hands. The rest of those words people ascribe to their favorite places... are generally meaningless. Why aren't we up in arms about Chez Panisse when they get their vegetables from over 750 miles from their restaurant? Why don't we flip our shit when Thomas Keller's TFL ships lambs 2/3 of the way across the country for your meal? Right, because they get a pass from the same jokers that think modern cooking is \"fake\"...  ", "Amen.

Does anyone know of any cookbooks like that? I mean similar types of things. It doesn\u2019t have to be exact. But just country vibes. Lots of Dutch oven action if that helps. Thanks.

You'll want to keep this in mind if you're cooking anything more delicate (seafood). \n\nAnother tip (probably obvious), but if you're trying to bring your Dutch oven temperature up more quickly, consider keeping the lid on 'til you've you've got it to the right heat \u2014 just remember that when you're taking the lid off, it'll be HOT so don't forget your oven mitts! I do this when I'm baking bread, since it needs to hit 450 degrees \u2014 I put the Dutch oven with its lid in the oven while it's pre-heating, and then take the lid off for the last 10 minutes before throwing in the bread dough.\n\nHappy cooking!"]}

I do enjoy transcribing recipes and going through a cookbook and bookmarking it, but everything looks to good and is too interesting and I end up stuffing too many stickies into them, turning the books into multi-colored porcupines on one end. I also need to find better colors. Red, yellow, orange, blue, and green is what I've been using, and being see-through plastic, some of them are really hard to tell apart (looking at you yellow and green... or is it green and yellow). \n\nWhat do you use to bookmark your cookbooks?

I write notes and make changes to ingredient qualities right on the page to remember for later.", "I.... don't. \n\n100+ cookbooks... I don't have any kind of system.", "I've done the condensed table of contents, where there's a folded up piece of paper in the front of the cookbook with a list of recipes I want to try + page number.\n\nI've done the full marking of a couple books with mini Post-Its when I had a temporary dietary restriction, as it helped me flip only to the recipes I could make (and just didn't mark any that weren't appealing). Otherwise, I currently only have a couple recipes marked in a book at a time, mostly because I might plan out my meals one night, go shopping a couple days later, then cook the next day - this lets me close the book and not lose track in the meantime. Once there's a couple bookmarks in a book (which may even be just a random piece of paper that happened to be nearby, torn into quarters), those bookmarks will get recycled to new recipes when I use the book in the future, instead of marking their original recipes into perpetuity.\n\nFor saving recipes I've already tried, it really helps, coincidentally, that I track everything in MyFitnessPal with a label like \"20.05.11 Asparagus salad (Six Seasons 73)\" - I now have a record dating back months of everything I've cooked labeled with the date, cookbook/source, and page number. I've found myself recently scrolling back through to remind myself what some of my favorite beet dishes have been, or what I did with the dandelion greens last time I got them.\n\nFor me, most of my recipe selection right now is ingredient based - I have this selection of local produce/meat, so what can I make with it? The answer is often found by picking a couple likely cookbooks, then looking through the index for that item (eg carrots), then making my selection that way. I also have a list (small but growing) on my phone's notes specifically for less common/frequent items, and when flipping through a cookbook, will note down recipes I want to try there. Similar to my MFP listing, each line includes the recipe name, description, book, and page number. Example:\n\n**RHUBARB**\n\n- & ginger chutney - Fresh India 243\n- Rose water meringues w/ roasted ... - Rose Water & Orange Blossoms 150\n- Beet & ... salad - Plenty More 178\n- Baked ... w/ sweet labneh - Plenty More 291\n- Esme's old-fashioned apple/... pudding - Plenty More 310\n- ...-almond galette - Dining In 285\n- Freekeh w/ lamb & ... - Pomegranates and Pinenuts 110\n- Spicy ... confit (condiment) - Season 278\n- ... & raspberry crumble cake - Henry's Simple 299\n- mackerel w/ spiced ... relish - Henry's Plenty 140\n\nThis has been super useful for ingredients (like rhubarb! Or figs) that I rarely get my hands on - especially if I don't know that it's available until I see it at the store/market! But, I've also started expanding it for use with more common ingredients (eg chicken thighs) to note recipes that I'm **super** interested in -am more judicious with that selection.\n\nOtherwise, like someone said, I can often remember some of the recipes I wanted to try and where they were - especially since I often go through a few week period cooking out of one book multiple times,  so the increased exposure helps. I don't worry about forgetting about something though, as there's always so many things to try - I've always got something interesting to cook! Also, if I have more ingredient freedom, my meal planning usually consists of me curling up on a couch with maybe 8 cookbooks that I feel like using, and flipping through until I find enough balanced recipes that stroke my fancy.\n\nI don't mark up most of my cookbooks, especially if they have photography/glossy pages - but I will put a post-it on the page sometimes with notes. I'll especially do this on recipes-for-other-recipes, to start tracking where else they are used. If I'm making a large batch of caper-raisin dressing from McFadden's Six Seasons but only need some of it for one recipe, it's helpful to know what other recipes call for it!\n\nI don't transcribe my recipes from a book unless the recipe is unnecessarily complicated or involves flipping pages. I usually just cook from the book. However, long directions that can be much simplified, ingredients/steps split over different spreads, etc, can get transcribed. I'm more likely to transcribe internet recipes, especially if I pulled them up on my phone.

These are the two cookbooks I'd grab if my house was on fire. They're invaluable resources for the serious Mexican home cook.\n\nAt the extreme end of the spectrum is Kennedy's *Oaxaca: An Infinite Gastronomy*, which is so authentic as to be, frankly, somewhat difficult to cook from. (Sure, you've got the huevos to make her wasp nest salsa, but she's insisting that you need to find the nest of a specific species of wasp that only exists in Oaxaca and that you can only collect said nest during a short period of the year. Good luck with that.) Also, because DK has, in her late career, come to view herself not as a conventional cookbook author but as a sort of anthropologist, there's no general index, only a regional one, which is just annoying if you're interested, like, trying to figure out something to make for dinner. Still, Kennedy's the Grande Dame of authentic anglophone Mexican cuisine, and you'll not find a better regional cookbook author on earth, save perhaps Paula Wolfert.\n\nSterling's *Yucat\u00e1n* is truly magnificent, tho also a bit hard to cook from unless you live near a good Caribbean grocery that will carry regional specialties like annatto and bitter (Seville) oranges. Also, Yucatecan cuisine is a probably the Mexican regional cuisine least like that of the rest of the nation (tho Oaxaca's is even more idiosyncratic). It was a tragedy when Sterling passed away last year, but he left a beautiful legacy.\n\nIf you're looking for an introduction to the cuisine, tho, I'd actually suggest Bayless's *Authentic Mexican*. Bayless is one of the best cookbook authors out there, and he is always insistently focused on *technique*, which can be important with Mexican cuisine because it differs so widely from the classical French and Asian techniques with which many American home cooks are more familiar. He's a better instructor than Kennedy or Sterling and just a better author in the sense that his cookbooks are easier to follow and a shade more practical. His *One Plate at a Time* and, to a lesser degree, his two *Everyday Mexican* books are a little more basic than *Authentic* and if anything even more technique-focused, but I tend to think that *Authentic* contains better, more varied recipes, whereas *One Plate* and the *Everyday* books are more focused on the sort of staples you'll find in every decent Mexican restaurant. His TV show *Mexico: One Plate at a Time* is also good teaching resource if you can stomach his obnoxious TV persona.\n\nTLDR: Bayless's *Authentic Mexican* is the best intro, but Kennedy's *Essential Cuisines* and *Art of Mexican* are more encyclopedic.

With a deluge of cookbooks released every year, it\u2019s getting much more difficult to gather attention from larger magazines and newspapers, which can make or break a book\u2019s success. How do the big time reviewers select which books to review in their pages? Ironically, it\u2019s you. Readers make all the difference, especially in the early days of a book\u2019s trek out into the real world. The more enthusiasm our readers show Melt: the Art of Macaroni and Cheese during its first few weeks of life, the more attention it will receive from the media \u2014 which is very important for us.\"\n\nAs an aside (seeing as how this is my first post to this subreddit), I've opted to not use my Amazon affiliate link in order to make this a more \"legitimate\" post. I've been watching this book grow, age and mature over the last few years and just received it this morning. I read it cover to cover, completely impressed, and then headed off to their book release party where I was able to sample an assortment of dishes ... a thoroughly deserving book (if you like mac and cheese ... and who doesn't!?!).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/1pazn5/do_you_like_comfort_food_a_friends_cookbook_could/", "created_utc": 1382862866.0, "score": 8, "author": "None", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/1pazn5/do_you_like_comfort_food_a_friends_cookbook_could/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": []}

I thought that it would be important to get him excited about cooking and really try cooking himself. Then I found the tv series \"How to cook like Heston\". Heston Blumenthal is one of the best cooks in the world and he is really funny, too. In this series he explains how to cook really basic things, but in the most amazing (and often time consuming) ways. For example, his roast chicken takes 24 hours. It is so over the top, but he explanations were what totally appealed to the technically minded person. Much of what he cooks on the show comes from his book \"Heston Blumenthal at home\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03h5T_tiyx0\n\nSo, if you can tell us a bit more about your friend, perhaps we could suggest something that really fits him.

Change the flour, change the liquid, etc.  \n\nIn the last 12 months that I've had the book I've memorised most of the ratios and now find my cooking greatly improved.\n\nFor a bachelor it might just be the perfect book because he doesn't have to think \"I need 3 cups of this flour and 5 cups of this liquid\", after a while he can think \"I have some flour, and I have some liquid, just ratio it out and VOILA\".  \n\nHope that helps", "OK, if he REALLY isn't going to cook anything that isn't dead simple (and isn't a gourmet), how about the \"I Hate to Cook Book\"?

Many of the freezer cooking guides I've come across give good ideas and tips but need to be adapted to you own style and set up. \n\nAll that said, here are some tips:\n\nLook at a good general cookbook (joy of cooking, etc.) browse and look for recipes that you think you'd like, have few steps and would freeze well (casseroles, chilies, spaghetti sauces, etc.).\n\nGet good freezer & oven safe containers or else you'll lose all your hard work to freezer burn. I like the pyrex style with a tupperware lid. Get various sizes around the 1- 2 serving size, if you're intent on cooking for a month at once, you'll need at least 40. Also, label everything - masking tape an permanent marker. You'll also need freezer bags and good saran wrap. \n\nPlan, plan, plan. Make lists. Walk into the kitchen with a list of cooking times and an ingredient list that lists all the recipes that use them (do 5 of your recipes use garlic, chop all your garlic the first time you need it and set aside the stuff you wont need, even if its for a few hours). I walk in with a checklist by time, so - 10am - put water on to boil (noodles, casserole). 10:05 start prepping chili ingredients - 10:30 wash pot, start browning beef (chili). As you're making this list, you need to think about your kitchen, it's space, and what you have to work with - chili takes 4 hours, 1 burner & uses the biggest pot, spaghetti takes the same, so, can't do both at once... Casserole takes 3 burners, uses medium pot, wok and a frying pan - wok can't fit on the stove with the chili pot & the frying pan, so do the wok stuff in between the chili and the spaghetti, while the chili pot is soaking... chili needs to cool for a minimum of 30 minutes before it goes in the freezer, so I'll need a lot of counter space when that finishes, so time the chili to finish when there's a gap in prep work...  \n\nIt is a lot of work, but it gets easier each time and can be very rewarding.\n\nBig tip - have some good music or pod casts lined up, or several solid hours of TV or good movies that you don't mind getting distracted from.\n\ntl,dr: a book wont be a good how to, it will only work if you do your own leg work \n", "If you're inexperienced you should be learning how to make quick healthy, easy meals.

There\u2019s so many. Any guesses on which cookbook Chef was talking about?

I appreciate that the authors also touch on things like gin, or coffee in addition to spices & herbs and many other food products. This is an exceptionally professional book and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find in Culinary School libraries and bookshops. \n\nSecond one I adore is The Food Substitutions Bible. This too is a VERY professional book which chefs in addition to avid cooks might like to geek out on. Not only does it include recipes to try of the things described in the book, but the descriptions of the items are very helpful in getting a sense of what they taste like, how they might be described by supporters vs detractors of the flavors, and like the book I note above, this one includes many different food products, their origin points, varieties available, and pictures of the items, alternative names they might be called in different food regions. While this book doesn\u2019t have an index per se, it\u2019s organized in alphabetical order for ease of locating* an item, but also has fantastic reference sources, list of websites, an incredible Bibliography, starts with how to use this book with its setup, and has a number of ingredient guides such as a list of choosing different types of fresh chiles, their characteristics, scoville units and substitutes\u2026and same thing with its list of dried chiles or Flour for example the list includes protein content, gluten content, taste, and best uses for each. Or lentils and dal lists include interior color, size and substitute options. There are a bunch of these lists including everything from Roe to edible flowers and more. This a great reference book! \n\nThe Flavor Bible by Karen Page & Andrew Dornan is also an awesome reference book with a VERY professional approach. Lots of renowned chefs include bits throughout the book and there\u2019s tons of cross referencing what can be paired with what by the \u201cflavor affinities\u201d. I didn\u2019t include any pictures of how they do an amazing job in this book but I\u2019ll try to add some later and link to them as an edit here because I don\u2019t feel like my descriptions can do these books justice. Depending on your learning style you may prefer one books\u2019s approach & style over another. This, like the other books approaches with flavors and companions of many different food products not just spices but definitely also cover spices and herbs. As I\u2019m going through this I realize how much I haven\u2019t even touched on, and a picture is worth a thousand words so let me get on uploading some and linking to them.\n\nLast book I adore but don\u2019t have my copy right now is a newer book called The Flavor Thesaurus by Niki Segnit. Wow! I really love this one too.

This will cut down ingredients while still having *plenty* of variety to explore.\n\n* **In Bibi's Kitchen** by Hawa Hassan and Julia Turshen - This book covers 8 African countries, so all one continent, but still a variety of flavors/cultural contexts. Just published this fall!\n\n* **Mediterranean Harvest** by Martha Rose Shulman - This is a vegetarian option, and is going to (surprise!) cover the Mediterranean region. Thus, recipes will range from the south of France and Greece around to Morocco and Tunisia. An older one, this was actually one of my first cookbooks.\n\nUnlike the truly global cookbooks I have seen (and read, and gave away because they weren't worth keeping), these books keep a good balance between depth and breadth, with enough variety to keep interest while having plenty of dishes to really explore a region, and a tight enough ingredient list to keep the pantry manageable with minimized food waste.", "Thank you, everyone! I'm new to the cooking world, and although I very much enjoy it, I can be a bit picky with different foods. I really want to step outside my comfort box and explore new foods hence why I wanted an international cookbook. I ended up getting Mark Bittman's Dinner for everyone after seeing it at Barnes & Noble. It has a variety of recipes, and he makes it very easy to understand. I'm very excited to start this next year with a new Cookbook. Thank you again :)", "You just looking for something multicultural or trying to test yourself with your cooking ability? Testing the limits o your pallete?", "Have you heard of the Culinaria series? You can buy them on eBay or thriftshops online for cheap. Although not strictly cookbooks per se, but they do include some basic recipes. Think of them as food and travel encyclopedias. I appreciate them because they are snapshots in time of how food was made and appreciated. I think they will be more valuable as the world become more globalized and international foods get co-oped into whatever new food trend of the day is."]}

Several of them do have recipes, but they're over-all focused on technique or theory. Also, most conventional cookbooks contain some of this sort of stuff, usually at the beginning or end, to a greater or lesser degree. This is especially true (I've notice, anecdotally) of \"ethnic\" cookbooks, which often contain an anthropological element.\n\n**McGee - On Food and Cooking**\n\nThis is probably the gold standard of \"theory\"-based books. McGee was a PhD at Yale (in English lit) who wrote the definitive summary of scientific knowledge concerning (mostly European) cooking techniques, as well as the historical development of those techniques. It's the book that, in some ways, kicked off the molecular gastronomy movement.\n\n**Page and Dornenburg - The Flavor Bible**\n\nBasically, it's 400 pages of lists of recommended flavor combinations. As a cook who has a pretty good technique background, I can say that this is probably the cookbook I turn to most when I'm improvising a recipe. It's basically a giant pile of inspiration. See also their *Culinary Artistry*.\n\n**Ruhlman - Ratio**\n\nI've never read it, but it's well reviewed, and sounds maybe closest to the description you laid out in your initial post. From the jacket: \"In Ratio, Michael Ruhlman, recognized as one of the great translators of the chef\u2019s craft for both home cooks and culinary professionals, shows how cooking with ratios will unchain you from recipes and set you free. Ratio is the truth of cooking: basic preparations that teach us how the fundamental ingredients of the kitchen\u2014water, flour, butter and oils, milk and cream, and eggs\u2014work. Detailing thirty-three essential ratios and suggesting enticing variations, Ruhlman empowers every cook to make countless doughs, batters, stocks, sauces, meats, and custards without ever again having to locate a recipe.\"\n\n**The Culinary Institute of America - The Professional Chef** \n\nWhat it sounds like: *the* reference for professional cooking technique. Again, far from recipe-less, but it's got a ton of the sort of big picture stuff you're looking for.\n\n**Myhrvold, Young, & Bilet - Modernist Cuisine**\n\nMyhrvold's a shitty human being, but the team he assembled put together an undeniably beautiful, consistently fascinating, and just as often infuriating compendium of the most state of the art cooking techniques out there.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAlso, Molly Shannon has two technique-oriented cookbooks, titled, appropriately enough, *All about Braising* and *All about Roasting* that included extended technique and theory sections. \n\nRegarding the theory and anthropology of ethnic cuisines, the prefatory materials in Diana Kennedy's Mexican cookbooks is particularly excellent (she's been published by Texas University Press of late, as a bit of context). Likewise, Fuschia Dunlop's books on Sichuanese and Yunanese cooking and David Thompson's gorgeous *Thai Food*. In a similar but European vein, check out the prefatory materials in Richard Olney's exquisite *Simple French Foods* and *The French Menu Cookbook*, which are more Epicurean philosophizing than they are conventional cookbooks. They're also beautifully written. (Dude was tight with the great New York School poet John Ashbery, if that's any sort of context for you.) \n\nYou might also want to check out MFK Fisher's *How to Cook a Wolf*, a brilliant meditation on cooking during the depression that the surrealists found particularly intriguing.\n\nHope this helps, and let me know if you have any questions!\n\nEDIT: Tom Colichio's *How to Think like a Chef* might also be in the ballpark.\n\n", "Are you looking for a reference book? There are books by Harold McGee, one is the curious cook and one is the Science of Food and Cooking. Both are great in explaining why certain things are done/ingredients mixed together and the all around science that comes into cooking. Hope that helps", "Tamar Adler's \"An Everlasting Meal\" is pretty much exactly what you're looking for. It's less a cookbook and more a book about a cooking lifestyle, without recipes so much as how to think about food such that you can turn it into delicious things. I found it rather lifechanging."]}

There are a couple reasons for this.  One is marketing-related: if you provide nutritional analyses, many potential readers will automatically dismiss your book, because they'll assume that your recipes must emphasize \"healthy eating\" and will therefore be less flavorful, or just \"weird\" in some way.  Another reason is that most of the really influential nutrition writers in the US oppose counting food values as a longterm approach to healthy eating, arguing that it's better to just aim for eating a wide variety of unrefined or minimally processed foods in moderation, and that the food counts provided in nutritional databases aren't accurate enough anyway to justify the effort of carefully tallying up your counts every day.\n\nFor these reasons, US publishers usually skip providing nutritional analyses in cookbooks, unless the book is aimed at one of the niche markets mentioned above (and no doubt they're happy to be spared the time, effort and expense anyway).  Kind of lame in my opinion, but that's the way it is.  I've never seen a cookbook of completely traditional Southern recipes that provides nutritional analyses, although I have seen some \"light\"/low-fat Southern cookbooks that provide them.  \n\nYou might check into the [cookbooks](https://www.oxmoorhouse.com/storefront/brands/southern-living/c90000007-c90000041-p0.html?sorter=bookPublicationDate-desc) compiled and published by the editors of *Southern Living* magazine--many food magazines nowadays employ a dietitian to oversee their \"healthy eating\" department, and sometimes that results in at least the calorie and macronutrient counts getting included in many of their books, even ones that don't necessarily have a \"healthy\" emphasis.  Do be aware, though, that *Southern Living* isn't by any means exclusively focused on traditional Southern cooking, if that's what you're looking for; a lot of their output is basically mainstream contemporary American cooking, with some slant towards Southern palates and style.  (ETA: as an example, [this cookbook](https://www.oxmoorhouse.com/storefront/brands/southern-living/the-all-new-ultimate-southern-living-cookbook/prod9780848731144.html) of theirs is specifically stated to include nutritional analyses, but some of the recipes mentioned in the link--\"Bistro Grilled Chicken Pizza,\" \"Chocolate Truffle Cake,\" \"Smoked Turkey Tetrazzini\" etc.--lead me to suspect that this cookbook is of the mainstream-American-with-some-traditionally-Southern-stuff variety.  Nothing wrong with that per se, it just depends on what you're looking for...)"]}

{"title": "Trying to find a vintage cookbook", "selftext": "I have been looking for a specific cookbook for years that has a very specific recipe in it (for sentimental reasons). I seem to remember the cookbook name being either \"Meals/Cooking for Two\" or \"One Pot Meals\". It was a hardbound cookbook, but not a huge tome. Maybe it was a Family Circle cookbook? Not sure. \n\nThe recipe I'm after was called \"Taos Tacos\" (or a very similar name) and used lamb, if that helps any. The rest of the cookbook had recipes organized by meat, and included tongue and liver dishes, so I suspect it was from the 50's or 60's. I remember a lot of the pictures, if not all of them, were black and white. I think there were some drawings of food too. Not like those old Betty Crocker books, where it was pretty and artistic, but more like they wanted you to know what your food should like like but couldn't put in lots of photo pages.\n\nThe specific recipe called for making your own tortillas (but called them pancakes), filling them with some deliciously spiced meat, lining them on a pan which also had sour cream on it, then throwing the pan into the oven for a while. The product was like some sort of enchilada with hints of sweetness. In fact, I think the recipe used brown sugar or something like that in the meat.\n\nRing a bell for anyone?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/3jkjh1/trying_to_find_a_vintage_cookbook/", "created_utc": 1441334356.0, "score": 4, "author": "Madbens", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/3jkjh1/trying_to_find_a_vintage_cookbook/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["According to Google books, this book:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Womans-Day-Encyclopedia-Cookery-11/dp/B0050525SK/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441405054&sr=1-3&keywords=Woman%27s+Day+Encyclopedia+Cookery+%3B+Prepared+Edited+Editors+Woman%27s+Day\n\nis from 1966 and has - according to Google Books- \nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=gQFHAAAAYAAJ&dq=Woman%27s+Day+Encyclopedia+of+Cookery+%3B+Prepared+and+Edited+by+the+Editors+of+Woman%27s+Day%2C+Volume+11&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Taos+Tacos  \n\na recipe for Taos Taco's in it.

She got a bunch of different family members to write down their best recipes and scanned other recipes that she had that I grew up loving. The best part is that I can add more recipes to it as I discover them. I love that I have my grandma's quiche recipe in her own handwriting.

Please help!", "selftext": "I have been looking for a specific cookbook for years that has a very specific recipe in it (for sentimental reasons). I seem to remember the cookbook name being either \"Meals/Cooking for Two\" or \"One Pot Meals\". It was a hardbound cookbook, but not a huge tome. Maybe it was a Family Circle cookbook? Not sure.\nThe recipe I'm after was called \"Taos Tacos\" (or a very similar name) and used lamb, if that helps any. The rest of the cookbook had recipes organized by meat, and included tongue and liver dishes, so I suspect it was from the 50's or 60's. I remember a lot of the pictures, if not all of them, were black and white. I think there were some drawings of food too.

{"title": "ISO: cook/health/diet book recommendations ", "selftext": "Hi everyone! I (23F) have struggled with my health throughout my life. Specifically, I\u2019ve struggled with making nutritious choices. I\u2019ve lost just over 30 pounds over the span of a year or so, but most of that is due to exercise and portion control (along with eating less processed junk). While losing weight is a huge plus, my main goal is developing better health habits I can stick with. I know that if I stick with these changes, other things (like weight loss) will come with time. \n\nI think I primarily struggle with two things: one, finding healthy, simple recipes that won\u2019t increase my weekly grocery bill ($100 or so); and, two, understanding which foods I should eat/how much/and why. Overall, I\u2019d really love to hit my macro (especially protein) and micro nutrients everyday. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to find books online, but there are so many out there that I get overwhelmed and don\u2019t know where to start. I would greatly appreciate recommendations for cookbooks full of healthy, simple recipes to help me reach my goals.

{"title": "Searching for my version of the big red Betty Crocker", "selftext": "Hi! When I struck out on my own, my mother gave me a huge red hardcover Betty Crocker cookbook.  Over the years, I pulled recipes from it without paying much attention to the version/edition and I eventually had several go-to recipes I used from that book.  My family moved recently and the book has come up missing.  I'm guessing it was somehow placed in a donate pile and made its way to Goodwill, because that thing was a massive brick and would be hard to miss.\n\nWell, now we're settling into our new home and I'm trying to replace it.  Looking on eBay and Amazon, I never realized there were so many versions, hardcover/spiral, etc. of the Betty Crocker Cookbook.  I don't even know what exactly was on the cover, but I remember it being similar to [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51z1IMVq6uL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg).  It was hard bound, and probably at least 500 pages.  It had color photos throughout, some full page, some smaller.\n\nThe only recipe I can come close to recalling was a simple roasted pecan dessert.  I tried Googling that and found [this](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/savory-pecans/460f6188-a72f-48f3-843f-83cb743a2e7f), but it's not exactly the same.  The recipe I used was basic - toss in butter, coat with salt, cook, cool, then coat half of the nuts with powdered sugar.  Trying to search with powdered sugar lead me to [this](https://recipesremembered.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/cinnamon-sugared-pecans/) which I thought was it until I hit the ingredient list and saw egg, which I definitely don't remember using.\n\nI know it's not much to go on, but I'd appreciate any help finding my lost version of that big red cookbook.  Thanks!\n\n(I should also mention that I blindly bought one online to take a stab at getting the version I remember, and the Betty Crocker Cookbook - Everything You Need To Know To Cook Today is not it.

Maybe I'm not the best person to recommend anything keto because I constantly fall off the bandwagon, BUT, I honestly like to go through my current non-low carb cookbooks and adjust the recipes to make them keto. I personally don't really enjoy subbing cauliflower rice for real rice, or zoodles for noodles, etc. I'd rather just skip the dish if I know subbing won't taste that great for me. Whenever I am ketoing, I mostly stick to meat and green veggies and eggs for breakfast. I also don't like working with different kinds of flours... Since I do dirty keto, I'd rather buy the keto bread, or the keto tortillas. And even then, I try and limit those. \n\nI DO have some keto products in my pantry that I decided are helpful to me (aside from the keto bread and tortillas), like a brown sugar substitute, powdered sugar substitute and my regular sugar substitute. I find having chicharrones handy are great, since you can easily make breading. Half crushed chicharrones/half parmesan cheese + spices. Then just dip into the egg wash first and coat. If I REALLY need a flour for breading, I'll use a little bit of coconut or almond flour. \n\nI'm Mexican by the way so that's what we mostly eat. A lot of pork, chicken, beef. Eggs for breakfast. My dad likes huevos rancheros... that happens to be low carb. There's a lot of Mexican recipes that are not labeled keto but happen to be keto. We have a lot of Mexican sauces using dried chile peppers that you can then use on top of various meats. Or creamy sauces with roasted poblano peppers and mixed with crema or cream cheese or whatever is in your fridge that you usually buy. You can put serve that with some grilled chicken.\n\nA book that I own that is yummy is called Peace, Love and Low Carb, and anything from George Stella. George Stella does use some substitutes but his recipes look delicious. The only reason why I don't cook that much from my keto cookbooks is because my father is a picky eater and enjoys traditional Mexican food. Is hard to try new stuff at times because I can't be cooking two different meals at once. I'd rather stick to Mexican and cook one main dish.\n\nKeep it simple at the beginning and repeat stuff often if you're okay with that.

They're really easy (especially cooking rice with a rice cooker).\n* Learn how to cook a couple veggies. The big things here are to learn 1) how to pick which produce is ripe, 2) which method to cook it with, and 3) how to tell when it's done. Actually, numbers 2 and 3 go for cooking almost all basic foods. Broccoli's a good one; it's reasonably forgiving and doesn't rot too fast in the fridge. (Or learn to throw together salads.)\n* Learn how to cook a couple meats. Baked or stir-fried chicken or pork... it's pretty easy to pick up a couple ways that work for you. Again, the big issue is knowing what method to cook it with and how to know it's done (I like stir-fry because it's fast and it's easy to tell when it's done). Beans and lentils are a cheaper way to get protein, if cost is a constraint.\n* Learn how to cook eggs. They're super cheap and fast, which is nice when you're both hungry *and* lazy.\n\nTo summarize: learn a starch or two, a meat or two, and a veggie or two to cover the biggest food groups. And eggs. Learn how to tell when a raw food is good (ripe/not rotten), what method to use to cook it, and how to tell when it's done.\n\nGradually you can work on seasoning food (salt and garlic is a good start), cooking with different methods (move beyond boiling and pan frying), and trying more \"exotic\" ingredients (I'm a fan of eggplant). Often the idea is to balance 3-4 basic flavors with each other (one dominant, a few supporting), and have a couple different textures and colors in there, too.\n\nIf if you like rice and can afford a rice cooker, I highly recommend it. I don't usually go for single-application appliances (as in, this cooks rice and does nothing else), but for a rice cooker it's worth it. Then just follow the instructions that come with it.", "Check out foodwishes.com. Chef John makes video recipes for each recipe and focuses on making sure you know HOW to cook the meal."]}

I thought maybe you mis-remembered it and it was actually \"7 hour ribs\", but even that doesn't *really* make sense.\n\nSecond, a mix of marinades and dry rubs could work. But you'd need to marinade *first* and add a dry rub second, or the rub would just fall off in the marinade. So let's say in this recipe you marinade first and then dry rub right before grilling/smoking.\n\nBut the reason 7 days doesn't really make sense in this context is because you'd never marinate ribs for even close to that long. In general most people don't marinate ribs at all, it just isn't a meat that needs it. The vast majority of recipes just give a generous coating of salt the night before and let the meat soak that up over night. But we'll say we are going to marinate them. So you marinate because you want to do one or all of the following three things: tenderize the meat (you'd need an acidic marinade), add moisture to it, add flavor.\n\nOf those three things, ribs don't need a tenderizing marinade. If you put any meat in a marinade for 7 days, it would turn into mush because the acids would just break the meat down. At *most*, acidic based marinades will be 24-48 hours.\n\nRibs also don't need moisture. Ribs are really fatty, and as you (slow) cook them, that fat breaks down and makes them both tender and juicy. But if you cook them 7 hours, then all the moisture would have evaporated already (even at the recommended smoking temp of 225* F), and your ribs will be starting to turn into jerky! (Which is why 7 hour ribs also doesn't make sense).\n\nSo maybe we're going to marinate to add flavor. This would never take 7 days, usually it's just a few hours at most. Longer marinades are doing that in order to tenderize the meat (which we know now ribs doesn't need). So let's skip the marinade, because really most of your actual flavor will come from a dry rub.\n\nNow third point of this is, the grilling/smoking. \n\nSmoking food is the process of slow cooking the food at very low temps (typically under 300f) in order to generate smoke and slowly breakdown the connective tissue within the meat. When you smoke, the best way to add a smokey flavor is to have a cold, damp surface for the smoke particles to bind to. Once the food warms up and the exterior develops a crust (dries out), it doesn't take on any more smoke flavor. So from this, we can understand that if you wanted to both *grill* and *smoke* a food, you'd smoke it *first*.\n\nGrilling is done at higher temps. In the context of ribs we might finish them at a higher temp because most rib sauces and rubs are heavy in sugar. So when you cook a sugar at high temp for a few minutes, it caramelizes the sugars and adds more flavor. This is also in agreement that we'd smoke ribs first and grill second.\n\nNow, I imagine you've had ribs again since 2006 and none of them have really captured the flavor you experienced on that day in 2006. There are thousands and thousands of ribs recipes out there, but most rub recipes are all pretty similar (salt, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, etc). Most bbq sauce recipes also are similar within a couple of different types (ketchup based vs mustard based). But clearly, none of these similar style ribs have quite matched what you want.\n\nAs it happens, there's a Bobby Flay recipe called \"5-Star Ribs\". This recipe is actually very unique. The rub he suggests has a couple of spices I've never really seen or used in a rub recipe, and the glaze/bbq sauce he makes is a one-of-a-kind mixup of maple syrup and horseradish. If I were you, I'd give this recipe a shot and try it out. It's a very interesting spin on smoked ribs and I'm definitely going to try it out myself.\n\nEven if it's not exactly what you're looking for, good luck in your search! It's really difficult to re-capture the food experiences we had when we were kids because 1) our taste sensitivity changes over time, and 2) a *huge* part of how good the food was is also wrapped up in our emotions and experiences from that time. Believe me, I've spent years now trying to re-create pizza hut's personal pan pizzas that blew my mind as a kid lol\n\nBobby Flay's 5-Star Spice-Rubbed Smoked Ribs  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsAECEfHnGM"]}

{"title": "Reddit Newbie Here! I am writing a cookbook and need Reddit to help me with a title", "selftext": "Good Afternoon Everyone!  I have been a fan of reddit for a while and lurking quietly in the corner.  I just started work on a cookbook of my Mediterranean recipes from a professional career that spanned 25 years.  It will be a slightly unconventional approach to Southern French, Italian, Moroccan and Spanish food with some Middle Eastern thrown in for good measure.  Here is the premise in a nutshell - Mediterranean cuisine has greatly evolved and developed from its early roots through a series of historical events.  Recipes blew across borders like the infamous winds of the region.   The shared story of conquests, invasions and immigrations.  Each gust brought strange new foods, habits and techniques to the tables of the beleaguered and conquerors alike.  When the dust settled we are left with an artist\u2019s palette of beautiful colors, textures and sensuous flavors.  My cooking style is the reimagined culinary heritage of the Mediterranean.\nThe Greeks gave Provence olives and grapes.  The expansion of olive groves and civilization went hand and hand with the expansion of the Greeks and Phoenicians. It has been said that the Mediterranean ends where olives cease to grow.    \nThe Romans came to help protect the besieged Greeks.  Eventually claiming the region as theirs and forming \u2018Provincia\u2019, the first Roman Provence outside of Italy.  The Romans built some of their greatest cities, N\u00eemes, Arles and Orange.  \nThe Moors, who at their height of power controlled three quarters of the Mediterranean. Only to be rivaled by the Roman Empire which reached slightly further.  The invading Moors brought the habit of serving many small vegetable appetizers as well as a preference of saffron flavored rice to potatoes. They introduced lamb, eggplant and almonds.  \nYes, this is the very general and basics of history but you need to know this to help with my first favor I ask.  I decided to break the book down by the five of the most infamous winds that blow through the region: the Mistral, the Levant, the Bora, the Sirocco and the Tramontane.  My idea is that they represent the crossing of cultural boundaries that the food did and come to represent the freedom of fusion that dominated the region.  Cassoulet was inspired by the Moors; the first pasta recipe was published in Spain; pizzas originated in Greece. I need a title that encapsulates the Mediterranean and the concepts of winds with metaphors of change.  It has to be catchy.  Whomever gives me the title will get a free signed copy of the book and an original Eat Till You Bleed apron.  Please help.  Please help keep me motivated.  Follow the journey of my book from a dream to a realization\u2026  Eat Till You Bleed is my food blog and you can kind of see the direction there...  thanks!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/2yhoyp/reddit_newbie_here_i_am_writing_a_cookbook_and/", "created_utc": 1425939370.0, "score": 1, "author": "None", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/2yhoyp/reddit_newbie_here_i_am_writing_a_cookbook_and/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Might not get a lot of help here, this subreddit is very quiet.", "My entire body of \"food + wind\" advice exists as jokes about flatulence.
