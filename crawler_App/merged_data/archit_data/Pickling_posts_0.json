This is my go-to recipe for sweet hot pickles:\n\nFor chips I use a pint jar:\n- 3-4 dried Thai chilis. I buy mine at the local Asian market\n- 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped, or thinly sliced\n- some thin slices of white onion\n- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper\n- 1/4 tsp turmeric\n- 1/2 tsp mustard seed\n- 1/4 tsp citric acid or 1 Tsp lemon juice \n- 1/8 tsp Ball pickle crisp\n- 1/2 tsp peppercorns\n- 1 bay leaf\n\nFor spears, use a quart jar and double the above ingredients. Remember, your spears and chips need to be *slightly* below the brine level of the jar, so they're submerged. And remember, you need ~1/2\" of headspace from the brine level to the jar lid.\n\nThe brine ratio I use is 1c white sugar to 1c white vinegar, or apple cider vinegar if you're feeling fancy. I don't think it impacts the flavor. There's already a lot going on.\n\nFirst, I dump everything but the cucumbers in the jars; spices, onion, citric acid / lemon juice, ect. Then I cut the ends off my cucumbers (toss the blossom end or the pickles can turn out mushy due to enzymes), pat dry, and __densely__ pack the slices, or spears. Funnel/ladel in the boiling brine, poke/burp any bubbles trapped between chips with a butter knife, wipe the rim with a clean paper towl, put on the lid, screw the ring on fnger tight, then immediately waterbath for 15 minutes. \n\nIt's important the jar lip is clean before you place the lid on. If it isn't clean it can prevent the lid from properly sealing.\n\nRemove the jars and let them cool to room temperature. Then remove the rings, wipe the jars clean, and affix the label. \n\nStore in a cool, dark place (basement) for a few months. Occasionally, lightly shake to agitate the spices. \n\n__BAM!__ You'll have the best hot pickles.

{"title": "My Clausen pickle recipe", "selftext": "I have been working on this for a few years and have gotten to a point where I consider it done. I have seen Clausen pickles come up a few times in the last few weeks so I though I would share my copycat recipe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n1. Clausen pickles have a pH of 6.8 - 7.0 according to my cheap pH meter. This means there is very little vinegar.\n2. They are not processed at using heat, which is why they need to be stored in the refrigerator (also because of their high pH).\n3. I do not believe they use apple cider vinegar as many recipes claim, it is white vinegar but seeing as though there is very little to begin with you could probably use either and not notice a difference.\n4. The ingredients were determined from the ingredients label and a scan of the solids in a jar after straining it out.\n5. I do not know the variety of cucumber they use, but Kirby's are close if you pick them early. Kirby's picked later will have thicker skin that isn't the same as Clausen.\n6. They store well in the refrigerator for up to 6 months, possibly longer but I wouldn't trust them to be shelf stable due to the pH being too high. At 6 months they are still hella crispy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese quantities are for a single quart canning jar and it scales linearly:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 cups water\n\n1/3rd cup white vinegar\n\n2 Tblsp salt\n\n2 Tsp sugar\n\n10 peppercorns\n\n1-2 large cloves of garlic. I like to finely dice it.\n\n1/2 Tsp red bell pepper, diced. (I just take a thin slice off a pepper).\n\n1 Tsp mustard seed\n\n1/4 Tsp Coriander\n\n1 Crushed Bay Leaf\n\n1/4 Tsp Turmeric\n\nA few sprigs of dill.\n\nAnd however many cucumber slices will fit into the jar\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Mix the water, vinegar, sugar and salt in a bowl (you do not heed to heat this, just stir until everything is dissolved).\n2. Add the peppercorns, garlic, red pepper, mustard seeds, coriander, bay leaf, turmeric, dill and cucumbers to the jar.\n3. Pour the liquid into the jar and leave a bit of headspace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as for processing I have done this a few different ways. Boiling water will fuck it up no matter how little time you go for, they end up mushy. Pressure canning, same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe they are minimally heat processed as doing these straight into the refrigerator isn't the same, they end up too crunchy and do not absorb the salt and other flavors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I have settled on is using an immersion circulator process them for 3 hours at 140F.

So far this seems to have have been successful.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pickling/comments/cccdb9/my_clausen_pickle_recipe/", "created_utc": 1562945601.0, "score": 143, "author": "Kriegenstein", "num_comments": 72, "permalink": "/r/pickling/comments/cccdb9/my_clausen_pickle_recipe/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["You're doing the Lord's work.", "I was hoping to find some comments on how well this recipe compares to Claussen flavour-wise.  I really wish I could nail that down. I've tweaked recipes for years and haven't figured it out completely yet.  I'd like to know if anyone has any comments to add since the original post.\n\nAnd yes, many recipes claim to be Claussen copy-cat, but those recipes don't taste like Claussen, not even close, but they know everyone \\_wants\\_ to replicate a Claussen.  That's called clickbait... and sadly, I've wasted many hours chasing that clickbait, ugh.\n\nAs for your recipe I see you add sugar (although not too much). The Claussen label says zero carbs so therefore zero sugar, so I'm thinking you're veering off base right away.  And you can be sure Claussen doesn't use any fresh ingredients other than the cukes, so all the spices will be dried versions.\n\nI do agree that Claussen's are definitely less vinegar than a typical pickle recipe, and they also have more salt, the highest salt of any major brands or other beloved brands like Grillos and Bubbies.  I assume the higher salt (as much as 50% more salt than some other brands) helps stifle some bacterial growth in the less acidic brine while using less (if any) heat.\n\nFor your recipe, the 2 Tbsp of salt might be right if you're using fine sea salt, but if you're using something course like kosher or pickling salt, I think you're going to need 3+ Tbsp of salt per quart jar to get up to Claussen level.  It will taste salty at first, but the salt concentration of the brine will drop as it absorbs into the cucumbers and equalizes.  Also, I'd say any pickling recipe really needs to specify salt based on weight, not any volumetric measure.  Its too important to muck up and there's too much variation in the various salt forms around in kitchens.\n\nThe interesting part of this post is the low temp pasteurization.   It also made me wonder how effective UV lights would be at killing bacteria?  Might have trouble killing bacteria in the nooks and crannies, but if it worked well, that would truly allow for heat-free pickling.  But in general, I agree that my heating process doesn't really affect the crispness much but gives me some comfort that bacteria have been mostly killed off.\n\nWhen I do my refrigerator pickles, I make a few assumptions.  One is that the bacteria is mostly on the skin/outside of the cucumber, or at least the vast majority of it.\n\nThe second assumption is that most of these pasteurization recipes seem like massive overkill when it comes to the time component.  Anything that boils has instantly killed the bacteria and even as it cools, anything above 140F continues to kill.  Any time spent over 140F, either in the heating or cooling process, is still in the kill zone.\n\nThe last major assumption is that the NaCl also kills many bacteria, and that higher concentration is better, as well as longer exposure to brine (days, weeks or months).  Note though that salt alone won't kill \\_all\\_ bacteria, some are halotolerant (tolerant to salt in relatively high concentrations), which is what fermented pickles rely on.\n\nSo based on those assumptions, I figure that any boiling salt water hitting the outside of the cuke will effectively kill most bacteria immediately, with no need for any extended time at elevated temps.  Any bacteria in nooks and crannies may take a minute or so, but should also be killed safely and very quickly, and that what isn't done in by heat, would be done in by the salt, at least for as long as my pickles will ever last in a jar before getting eaten.  So in my experience, a pour-over of boiling brine will do the job just fine, without cooking the cukes much at all.\n\nSo my process is this:\n\n1. I get my pickling cukes the day they were picked, straight from the farm, then soak them in ice cold water immediately, and gently brush them (trying not to damage the skin or knock off the little bumps).  Toss out anything that is damaged, or, put all the damaged ones in the same jar and eat them first (before they can go bad).\n2. I pre-fill each clean jar with the dry spices, garlic, dill, etc...\n3. I make my brine (vinegar/water/salt) in a massive pot, I count on about 2+ cups of brine per quart jar.  I start heating it up right away, which will take a bit of time to boil since its huge.  Once its at a boil, I let it simmer and stay close to boiling.\n4. I start cutting and stuffing jars.  I cut of 1/8\" from blossom end (some places say 1/16\").  I figure I can sacrifice another 1/16\" off my pickle for a margin of safety.\n5. Don't overstuff the jars, obviously everything needs to be covered.  I do a variety of whole small cukes, and halves and spears for the rest.  I do up to 20 lbs at a time, about 1lb of cukes per quart jar.\n6. Once all jars are stuffed with cukes, I start dipping a 2-cup pyrex measuring cup into the brine pot, and then start filling jars, leaving an inch+ of headroom, but covering all cukes.\n7. I close all the lids, and leave them on the counter until all jars are filled and sealed.\n8. Now they go straight into the spare refrigerator to start cooling them down asap to minimize any additional cooking.  I haven't tried a cold water bath for fear of breaking the glass.\n\nI've never had a problem with them going bad, and they of course aren't \\_as\\_ crisp after 6 months, but they're still good.  Based on my thermal equilibrium calcs, adding boiling brine to room-temp cucumbers in equal volumes (like in a jar) will fairly quickly drop the temp to 140F (less than 10 minutes).  After that, the bacteria killing effect is effectively gone so you should cool/refrigerate asap at that point to minimize cooking.  These are rough calcs ignoring minor effects, but the point is, that the boiling brine poured over a jar of cucumbers will quickly drop in temp before it cooks the inside of the cucumbers very much, while instantly killing most all surface bacteria.\n\nI think on my next batch, I might nerd-out and track the temperature drop of the brine, as well as the internal temp of a cucumber using my boiling pour-over method, and then compare that against a jar held at 140F for 3 hours as this post suggest.  Nothing better than a A-B test.\n\nNow I'm just waiting for the call from the farm that my cukes are ready!\n\nCheers.", "Just made your recipe tonight. This brine is spot on for claussen, well done and thanks a ton.

Crunchy, umami, and flavorful.*\n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n**Veggies (however much you like; we really like radish and onion with a touch of jalapen\u0303o)**\n\n* Daikon radish, chopped 1 inch squares\n* Brown onion, chopped 1 inch squares\u00a0\n* Jalapen\u0303o, chopped 1 inch squares\n\n**Sauce Ratio**\n\n* 2 cup soy sauce (use\u00a0Regular Kikkoman)\n* 2 cup water (optional, dashima kelp water\\*)\n* 1.5 cup white sugar\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Chop veggies into thin, 1 inch squares. Set aside in air tight container.\n2. Heat up 2 cup soy sauce, 2 cup water (optional, dashima kelp water; boil dashima kelp in water)\\*, 2 cup vinegar, and 1.5 cup sugar in a large pot. Stir around until it comes to a slight boil. Turn off heat and wait 5 min.\n3. Add sauce mixture (needs to be warm) to chopped veggies in airtight container. Fill up to top (leave a little space on top).\u00a0Optional, add a weighted plate to push down the veggies so all is submerged (leave a little space on top).\n4. Once completely cooled down, put the lid on. Then refrigerate. It will be ready to enjoy in 1-3 days!\n\n### NOTES:\n\n\\*For more flavor, boil water with dashima kelp. This adds a slight flavor that brings out optimal taste to the side dish.\n\n[Source/Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ahnestkitchen/): I'm actually in the process of learning all of my Mom's Korean dishes.

I have been fermenting a couple of years now, and lactofermentation produces its own acid. Technically, a ferment is not called a pickle. A ferment is a living culture with yeast, bacteria, gas bubbles and the whole shebang, while a pickle is a mixture of an acid/salt/sugar/spice mix (to varying degrees) that is added to fruits and vegetables and canned, usually after heating the mix. The vinegar is such a small amount in this recipe, that it is adding some flavor element and not acting as a pickle. If you saw bubbling and gas production, you have yourself a ferment! Fermented vegetables are often called pickled, so the term is not used precisely. For example, folks here in NC who make cucumber pickles the \"old fashioned way\" call them grape leaf pickles. The ferment consists of cucumbers, water, salt, maybe garlic, and a couple of grape leaves for their tannic acid to keep them crisper.  These are fermented, not hot packed. I will give this a lime pickle go. Thank you so much for sharing!", "Is it fermentation if you pickle with vinegar?"]}

You simply season Korean pickles in one bowl, mix it up, and make some good Korean Oiji Muchim.*\n\n### INGREDIENTS:\n\n* 6 Korean pickles ([Oiji, recipe here](https://www.ahnesty.com/food/oiji))\\* (see notes)\n* 2 green onions, chopped\n* 1 Tbsp sesame seeds, roasted\n* 1 Tbsp Korean red pepper flakes\n* 1/2 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp white sugar\n* 1/2 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp garlic, minced\n* 1/2 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp sesame oil\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Rinse Korean pickles under running water. Chop the ends off the pickles, and slice into thin discs, about 0.5 cm thick. Taste test a sliced pickle, and gauge how salty it is. Mind you, it's a pickle so it will be very salty, so we will take out a bit of that saltiness in the next step.\n2. Submerge sliced pickles in a bowl of filtered water for 10 minutes (Do NOT exceed 10 minutes!). This is to take out just a little bit of the saltiness, but only do it in increments of 10 minutes because you do not want to lose the sweet, salty vinegar flavor of the pickle. Taste test a sliced pickle after 10 minutes; at this point, it should be OK to move onto the next step. It should still be salty.\n3. Strain sliced pickles and then gently squeeze out the excess water out of the pickles by clenching the pickles in-between two hands. Do NOT squeeze out too much!\n4. In the medium bowl with the pickles, add all the ingredients: 2 green onions, chopped, 1 Tbsp sesame seeds, roasted, 1 Tbsp Korean red pepper flakes, 1/2 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp white sugar, 1/2 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp garlic, minced, 1/2 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp sesame oil. Adjust where it's needed... and enjoy!\n5. Store in an airtight container and refrigerate any leftovers.\u00a0\n\n### NOTES:\n\n\\*I recommend making Korean pickles at home. It\u2019s fresher, crunchy, and lasts a LONG time. You simply keep it in your fridge and whip it out whenever you are craving this recipe (Oiji Muchim, Korean Spicy Seasoned Pickles).  But yes, you can buy Korean pickles at the Korean Grocery Market, but it\u2019s significantly not as good as home-made; less crunchy and not fresh.", "I have been making these every few days, can not describe how well they go with just rice.

Live and learn. Maybe blend them with some hot peppers for a sauce at this point? I would do them as a ferment (cold saltwater) for several days at room temp then fridge. If you are pouring hot brine on them, they're just not gonna make it.", "Bear with me, there is a point to this. \n\nThere is this thing in whiskey-drinking called an infinity bottle, where you basically blend your own from your favorite tipples, and add to the bottle as necessary. Relevant to that, I do something similar with my fridge/quick/vinegar pickles (I have seen a lot of terminology used interchangeably, so I wanted to be precise.) \n\nWhatever is growing excessively, or is ripe in the garden (or headed towards overripe on the table) goes into the jar. Shishito peppers, cukes, serranos, onions....and as of lately, cherry tomatoes. I put mine in whole, unpierced, into cold brine. Add a bit more vinegar to keep it acidic and the brine-line full towards the top of the jar. Add a bay leaf (or maybe two!) and whatever seasonings I feel like morphing it towards. Lately it's been chipotle, but as fall comes closer, I am thinking tarragon, juniper and green herbs. The chipotle will add a nice bite to it. \n\nThe biggest problem is patience, though. My shishitos took over a week to soak any vinegar up; my tomatoes took like a week and a half. Left it on the table at room temp for three days, flipped it side to side, and left it in the fridge for the remainder of brine-time. They're pretty lovely now! But day 3 tasting was just....disappointment incarnate. Like I had been soaking them in plain water with a *suggestion* of vinegar. Ugh. Fucking gross.\n\nIf you do saltwater fermentation, take my advice and use whole, unpierced tomatoes for those, too. Maybe someone else has had better luck (maybe my brine was too salty/not salty enough,) but my cut ones just grew mold, even after taking every step to be sterile and keep them under liquid. Whole (but smaller!) ones seem to have better luck, at least if Youtube is to be believed.", "Everything turned out great.

Consuming high levels of sodium can contribute to high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. It is recommended to limit sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day for adults, and to 1,500 mg per day for people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.\n\nAdditionally, some types of pickles are made with high-fructose corn syrup or other sweeteners, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems if consumed in excess. It is important to read labels and choose pickles that are made with minimal added sugars.\n\nOverall, pickles can be a part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. It is important to consider the sodium and sugar content of pickles and to choose varieties that are lower in these nutrients.

Press just enough to create pressure but not to crush the vegetables.

Boil half vinegar,  half water in a pot.  Stir in salt and sugar. For just 1 jar use  1 cup vinegar,  1 cup water,  1 spoonful each of salt and sugar.  \n\n3. Add spices to jar.  Various spices can be used.  Peppercorn, dill, etc. \n\n4. Stuff veggies in jar. \n\n5. Pour mixture into jar.  Leave a half inch of space.  \n\n6. Let jar cool off until room temperature\n\n7. Refrigerate. Now you've got fridge pickles.  They should last a couple months, but they'll pretty much be ready over night.  \n\nI believe there's more to regular pickling,  but this is fridge pickles, which is a good starting point.\n\nMaybe someone with more experience could confirm or deny if I got it right or missed something", "No, you get pictures of blue-ish garlic and nothing else.", "Ball has a canning guide they put out yearly. That might be a good starting point. It is fairly inexpensive. Another consideration is once you figure out a brine ratio you like (which is really all about trial and error) take a look at the ingredient lists of some of your favorite pickles and that can help you figure out what kinds of spices you want to use. There are food safety risks with pickling that you should be aware of, but once you understand how pH works to control microbial growth on the high and low ends you are golden. I would recommend that your first few times you use basic recipes from reliable sources, specifically because you don't have a full understanding of the microbes at work, which is okay! Everyone has to start somewhere and not everyone has a food science degree. My grandmother certainly didn't when she started making pickles 70 years ago, or her mother before her.", "Freshpreserving.com is the best for the basics,especially if you want to process your pickles for long term storage."]}

Instead of chopping cabbage, I was lazy and bought a big bag of coleslaw mix. One 10 oz bag of coleslaw mix filled my quart jar about halfway after I massaged it and everything, so it left enough room for a pickling weight and worked out pretty well.\n\nAfter it fermented for a few weeks, I pushed the liquid out and rinsed it. I realize that that gets rid of the good bacteria and everything, but it was a tad too salty to use in this recipe, hence the rinsing. For my sauerkraut balls, I followed [this recipe](http://www.midwestliving.com/recipe/appetizers-snacks/sauerkraut-balls). I used a cookie scoop to make sure that all my scoops of sauerkraut filling were equal in size.\n\nTo get big sauerkraut balls with a crunchy outer coating like mine, use panko instead of fine breadcrumbs. Also, double bread them. So I rolled my sauerkraut balls in flour, then egg, then panko, then egg again, then panko again. When you use extra breading like that, plan ahead. I needed 10 eggs and a box and a half of panko bread crumbs to make 30 sauerkraut balls!\n\nBy that point, the sauerkraut balls were room temperature, so they took less than 2 minutes to fry. Watch them closely! Instead of drying them on paper towels, whenever I deep fry anything, I set it on a cooling rack with paper towels underneath so that air can still flow under my food. I think it makes my food crunchier.\n\nFor my dipping sauce, I used one part kewpie mayonnaise, four parts spicy brown mustard and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I was inspired by the dipping sauce [here](https://www.wideopeneats.com/recipes/sauerkraut-balls-with-creamy-mustard-dipping-sauce/?utm_campaign=sharebar&utm_medium=social&utm_source=pinterest). My sauerkraut balls are currently sitting in my freezer. I'm trying [the procedure from Kraft's website](https://www.kraftrecipes.com/amp/recipe/207877/sauerkraut-balls) to freeze them and then bake them later. Hopefully they'll be a unique way to enjoy pork and cabbage on New Year's."]}

My family used to love them and I'd give out Jars to my  buddy who is really poor and loves homemade pickled veggies amd I'd give out some to my extended family becsuse everyone liked them. Who doesn't like homemade pickles lol,? I used to make some without so much garlic and jalapenos and some with neither becsuse my mom hated garlic and jalapenos and a lot of people don't like as much garlic and jalapenos as I do lol. My family and friends kept asking where are homemade pickled veggies amd I explained how I stopped after screwing up one time. Lol they're like that doesn't sound like you, you just gave up? Lol I had a new kid and other hobbies I picked up so it didn't bother me thsy much to stop. Now it does and am going to buy more jars and start up again.\n\nAbout 3 years ago I was looking for my canning jars and my gf at the time was like I tossed them away. She's like I asked you. No, sorry thst didn't happen. I would never throw away 2 cases of canning jars. They take up almost no space and were in the storage under the stairs where I have extra room so why would I give her the \"ok\"  to start throwing them out when we didn't  need the space and even if we did need space, I still would have kept them.lol I love pickling and knew I'd get back into it. What sucks is my recipe was in there and she tossed that out too. That took me years to get exactly how I wanted it. I started off with a recipe from the internet and the  tweaked it over the course of at least two years.", "You need more brine"]}

What this does is to draw water out of the raw onions and (I think) prime them to pick up more flavor from the brine, but I can't say I've noticed a huge difference in flavor or texture. What I have noticed is that (a) they soften, making it easier to pack more into a jar and resulting in a more pliable finished product, and (b) if you're not using a pink brine, this helps them get pinker.\n\nOnions are quite easy and a great place to start. Have fun!", "As the others have said, try it all. I do prefer using a mandoline to get consistent cuts. The end product turns out prettier. Always use a guard or protective glove when using one.

Is it possible to just heat-seal the jar using hot water instead?\n3. When I\u2019ve made vinegar-pickled onions in the past, I\u2019ve boiled the jar and lid and disinfected my cutting board with surface cleaner.

Most peppers -except for thin walled ones - put off enough liquid after being salted that I pretty much NEVER add water to my mash. Just peppers, garlic and salt. Let it sit in a bowl for 30 mins or so, then pack well into jars. The peppers will release more than enough brine to cover everything. \n\n2. Lids with fermentation locks are nice but not necessary. You could use a screw-on lid and burp it twice a day by unscrewing it a bit, releasing the built up CO2, and retightening. Or kimchi style in a plastic container with a burping lid. \n\nAlternately, you can float a brine-filled plastic bag on top of your lidless mash jar. \n\n3. I don\u2019t sterilize anything when making fermentations.

You can burp manually or get airlocks. I prefer airlocks because they are set and forget. If you go that way, fill your airlocks with brine in case of overflow. \n\n3) Cleaning well with hot soapy water is all you need.\n\nCome join us over at r/FermentedHotSauce or r/fermentation for more hot sauce discussion"]}

Gherkins are just watery here with a minor dill taste to them.\n\nI'm looking to make my own but want something good and authentic to satisfy my cravings.\n\nI think I've only come across one brand in the past that had garlic in them.\n\nAny recipes are appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pickling/comments/1i9wsxn/does_anyone_have_a_recipe_for_non_canned_american/", "created_utc": 1737838532.0, "score": 8, "author": "Kjrsv", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/pickling/comments/1i9wsxn/does_anyone_have_a_recipe_for_non_canned_american/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I make mine with dill flavored vinegar for more flavor. \n\nI infuse distilled white vinegar with dill blossoms, the yellow flowers.

Vinegar though, I do add a splash of apple cider vinegar after the initial brine measurements, just for extra flavors and acidity. I like to do spears for my pickles, but if you have mini whole cucumbers, just slice to top off thinly and it will all soak up.Make sure to use FRESH dill if you want a dill pickle. Use salt to taste, and I usually put three to four cloves of garlic in my jar whole, I love garlicky pickles. I add whole peppercorns, mustard seeds, dill seeds, and sometimes dried red chili peppers if I want spicy pickles.

The issue is that there are different types of bacteria that predominate a ferment at different times.

I dunno if you\u2019ve done anything WRONG but I\u2019d imagine there\u2019s probably something you could add that would help keep them crisp.", "There are few different things to consider here, although I don\u2019t have a definite answer and there are always a couple unknowns. While I haven\u2019t specifically pickled silver skin onions there are a few things that can cause the softening during pickling. While the onions were pickled right away the closer the produce is to starting to going soft on its own, the more likely it is that they will go softer while pickling, this tends to happen more when pickling whole or larger items. Although they\u2019re topped it can take longer for the vinegar solution to penetrate so might have just been unlucky this way, so it\u2019s almost like they continue to \u201cage\u201d a little bit further until enough brine has managed to find its way in there, you\u2019re not necessarily doing anything wrong to cause this.\n\nHot brining or blanching onions a hair too long can do this as well, they\u2019ll still seem crunchy at first but the structure will still soften slightly over time if they\u2019ve been in the heat a little too long. Even though you may have put them in an ice bath after blanching they might have been in there a few seconds too long and it\u2019s almost like it starts a little timer for the softening process. The vinegar brine will still need to work its way to the middle and the heat it was exposed to can narrow this little window, the center is the last part to get pickled and often takes the longest, hence it being softer.\n\nI find that stuff stays crunchier when stored in the fridge, so you could try refrigerating them for a while after you add the vinegar and everything is at a safe temperature to do so. This will allow them to go through the absorption process in a cold environment before transferring to a room temperature pantry or cupboard for long term storage, so it buys a little time in that window where things tend to go soft. If you are only doing a few jars of onions, you could also just store them in there the entire duration before consumption. I \u201ccold pickle\u201d sliced onion in the refrigerator regularly and they\u2019re just as crunchy as when they\u2019re first sliced over a month later, so I imagine it would help if you\u2019re actually \u201ccanning\u201d them as well.\n\nRegarding the acidity you picked up on, pickling vinegar sold in stores often has 1-3% higher acetic acid by volume than distilled white vinegar. This would have explained why you found them more acidic and couldn\u2019t eat too many. *Hold up, it\u2019s only 1-3% higher, how would this make that much of a difference?* I have experienced this first hand as while I found the brine tasted fine on its own, I actually started to sweat after eating from batches that I had made with the pickling vinegar \ud83d\ude02 The acidic flavour gets concentrated in what you pickle and it seems that extra 2-3% is all it takes!

I would recommend cooking them until they're just short of where you want them, and then doing rapid cooling by filling a sink or large container with enough cold water so that it comes almost all the way up to the rim of whatever you have them in.

If you do, do you also notice texture varying greatly and if you leave it blanched too much, does it get too soggy for you too?\n\nI did some testing already in terms of how long to wait after water bath before refrigerating it.

Because if you\u2019re gonna eat them within a month and you keep them in the fridge you\u2019ll be totally fine. \n\nI am just a cook, not an expert, but as far as I know, there are basically two kinds of pickling. There\u2019s natural fermentation, and then there\u2019s quick pickling using a vinegar brine. \n\nFermentation is riskier and is the one associated with botulism because you\u2019re actually trying to encourage a specific kind of bacteria to grow and produce the funky sour flavors  that come from fermentation. If you mess this up, and the wrong kind of bacteria takes over, it can make you really sick. \n\nQuick pickling is what you did, it is essentially just a method of cooking the vegetables that makes them taste like they were fermented. That taste comes from the vinegar, which has already been fermented. The vinegar also adds acidity, which discourages bacterial growth. Then you add the salt and sugar, which also have the effect of discouraging bacterial growth. The combined result of this is that you create a liquid that will severely slow down the progress of any microbes that happen to be in or on whatever you\u2019re pickling. Pickles made in this way can be stored safely for about a month (if you can resist eating them that long)!", "It\u2019s fine"]}

I only bothered doing that once because I was too sick to get the item back before it continued rotting in my fridge, otherwise I would definitely try to take stuff in the store because I\u2019m sure if you do that too much they won\u2019t do it anymore at some point.\nAnd that same point if you wanna return something and you\u2019ve gotten rid of your receipt, call them and they\u2019ll look it up on your Kroger plus card, they may or may not have a way to do that in the store I\u2019m not sure of it.

Which way would give me a bolder flavor or more tannins, I've read that the tannins are what helps make pickles crunchy? \n\nSecondly,  I have seen two different ways to make pickles. Canning/ high heat by boiling mason jars and storing them for a long time, or refrigerating. Which would be the best to use in this case? Do I need to boil the mason jars regardless? Does either process effect the flavor or crispness of the pickle? I think the refrigerating process would be a lot easier for me with school and such, but I want to make sure I do a good job and am willing to try the high high process. Does anyone have any reliable links/ step by step advice on how to do either? \n\n  \nThank you for any help, and I might edit this for any other questions I think up!

{"title": "Honey Pickled Apples recipe critique?", "selftext": "**EDIT: IF YOU ARE FINDING THIS RECIPE OFF GOOGLE, PLEASE NOTE IT IS NOT SHELF-STABLE.**\n\nTesting indicated a pH of around 5, which is insufficient to prevent botulism. This batch was stored in the fridge and consumed within two weeks, I have no information on its stability at room temperature.\n\nFor those who still want to try it, here are some suggested adjustments:\n\n- **For taste**: The original recipe\u2019s vinegar can be quite strong. Consider substituting 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar to balance the flavor. This version should still be refrigerated and used within two weeks. I consider this incredible sweetness to be most in the spirit of what Spice and Wolf was aiming for.\n\n- **For storage**:  I am still not endorsing trying this as a shelf-stable modification. However, some similar recipes I found use equal parts vinegar and sugar (instead of 1:2), which may help lower the pH but could also alter the taste and texture unfavorably.\n\n---\n\nFollowing the finishing of the new Spice and Wolf I wanted to try making honey pickled fruit which is briefly mentioned in the show. None of the recipes I found online seem to pickle for more than like 24 hours so I tried making my own recipe. \n\nI plan on trying it this weekend and was hoping for critique from the better informed, particularly around safety as I haven't really pickled properly before.

Sterilize glass jars and lids by boiling them for 10 minutes.\n\n2. Prepare the apples: Slice apples thinly. Immediately place them in a bowl of water mixed with lemon juice to prevent browning.\n\n3. In a large pot, combine honey, apple cider vinegar, salt, ginger, cinnamon sticks, allspice berries, ground cloves, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n4. Add apple slices to the hot syrup and simmer for 5 minutes until slightly softened but still crisp.\n\n5. Layer the apple slices, chopped figs, and almonds into the sterilized jars, leaving about 1/2 inch of space at the top. Tuck in the ginger slices and cinnamon sticks\n\n7. Transfer the fruit mixture into sterilized jars. Ladle the hot syrup over the fruit, ensuring all pieces are covered.\n\n9. Wipe jar rims clean and apply sterilized lids and bands.\n\n10. Process the jars fully submerged in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes.\n\n11. Remove jars and let cool completely.

The injection site will seal over itself, protecting any contaminants from the vinegar. Yes, one would *expect* something bad with that method.\n\nBut aside from that one case, that *single* case, which used a very-non-standard method (I've never come across poking the eggs anywhere else), what other cases have been reported for food poisoning from pickled eggs?\n\nAlso, where can I find protocols used by commercial producers of shelf-stable pickled eggs?

That is the ONLY time it has been recorded, before or since. However because of that case, home pickled eggs are considered unsafe at room temperature in the US by the FDA\n\n>This is the first reported case of botulism related to eating pickled eggs. The amount of toxin detected in the recovered egg yolk suggested that bacterial growth was concentrated in that portion of the egg. Intact eggs that have been hard-boiled should be free of bacteria or spores. Pricking cooked eggs may introduce *C. botulinum* spores into the yolk. Portions of the yolk that remained anaerobic and inadequately pickled (i.e., not acidified to pH <4.6) may have allowed *C. botulinum* spores to germinate, grow, and form toxin. Setting the pickling jar in sunlight provided warmth that facilitated bacterial growth and toxin production.\n\nThis passage in particular is interesting to me. The CDC of 1997 believed it was just the toothpick puncture that made them unsafe and believed intact eggs to be free of spores and safe. As well as the heat from sunlight.\n\nI do not know what the commercial producers do. That would be helpful to know regardless.

Distilled white vinegar is going to be okay as well since you\u2019re adding flavors.

The flavor and texture won\u2019t be exact when you go this, but it will give you an idea. So make a cup of brine using the ingredients in the recipe like you\u2019d make tea. Let it cool down.

Always got something wrong, whether it was proportions, boil time, size of cucumber slices, spice ratios, whatever.  Some really good, some wound up with a reluctant taste and straight to the compost bin.  \n\nI decided to try sous vide this year.  Ran a very basic ratio of 1:1 of plain white (5%) vinegar and water, 1 tablespoon of salt per cup of liquid, added spices by eye (brown and yellow mustard seeds, coriander, dill seed and dill weed, black peppercorns) and a couple cloves of garlic per jar.  Boiled the brine to dissolve the salt, packed sterilized jars with cuke slices, added brine, installed snap lids and put in a 140-degree hot water bath for 3 hours.  No pickle crisp.  All of the jars sealed within an hour of being removed from the water bath.\n\nI couldn't wait so I cracked a jar open after only a week.  They came out perfect.  Crunchy as a fresh cucumber, really intense flavor, plenty of dill and garlic coming through and some heat from the mustard and peppercorns.  They can only get better with time.\n\nMy concern, however, is the time & temperature.  I've read that what I used for time & temp is acceptable, but have read 180 for 30 minutes also works.  I want shelf-stable pickles, although I have no problem refrigerating them.  Is there a middle ground?  What is the \"safer\" option?  Obviously 180 for 30 min. takes a lot less time, but I don't care about that.  I have the time.  After trying this batch, I never want to go back to traditional water bath canning, but I want to make sure that what I'm doing won't kill me either.  \n\nAlso, I want to try this with a sweet-but-spicy bread-and-butter recipe.  What would anyone recommend for brine ratios/proportions and ingredients?  We're very partial to Mt. Olive B&B pickles and want to try to duplicate the sweetness with a little more heat.

There have been times where I have more cucumbers than I planned for and have to grab another jar, in which case I wash very well with soap and as hot water as my sink can make. \n\n>Can you store pickles outside the fridge? If so where?\n\nYes. I store mine in a cold basement corner. There's one unfinished section of the basement, so they're in boxes right on the cement. \n\n>Should I change the recipe for longer term pickles? Like lower acidity?\n\nI don't know what ratio you're currently using, but I use 12 cups of water and 5 cups of vinegar to make 10 jars of pickles. Adjust the ratio as you need. But to answer your question, no, there shouldn't be any huge changes to a recipe.\n\n>Is it okay to reuse the brine for many rounds of pickles?\n\nYou can probably reuse it once or twice before the flavor and acidity wears out. Truthfully I've never done it with my homemade stuff because I'm a brine sipper, taking a gulp every once in a while. Don't usually have a lot left when the pickles are done...."]}

It's behind a paywall now, but the recipe said that eating raw chicken breast would be safe if you briefly blanched it in boiling water first, killing any bacteria on the surface.  The problem with thats is that it ignores a basic fact of food safety, chicken is a relatively porous meat that bacteria can penetrate.  Any microorganisms on the surface can migrate into the center, potentially making you sick unless you bring the interior to a temperature high enough and long enough to kill the pathogens.\n\nThere is another low temperature pasteurizing method published by the USDA which involves starting the pickles in a hot water bath between 120-140F.  The water bath is then heated to between 180 and 185F, and held for 30 minutes.  ChefSteps likely based their 140F method on pasteurization tables, while the USDA undoubtedly conducted lab tests.  I feel safer with the 180F method, and I did a side-by-side taste test of the twowith cucumber pickles and thought that the 180F batch was slightly more crisp if anything.\n\nUnfortunately, the 180F has only been tested with limited recipes and I don't believe any of them were for pickled peppers.

I swear by it.", "Please understand there are different types of pickling.\n\nIf you want a quick pickle, that is usually accomplished via a heated, vinegar-based solution, perhaps with some sugar added. You see this often with pickled onions, for instance.\n\nSome people \"can\" vegetables, such as bread and butter pickles (AKA \"putting up\"). This approach requires using a water bath at high heat, which removes all air from a jar (creating a vacuum). The advantage of this method is the contents become shelf-stable, thus not requiring refrigeration until usage. (When you open that jar, you must refrigerate the contents.) A good resource is the Ball Blue Book, which you can find at your library. \n\nFinally, true dill pickles are made via lacto-fermentation. Fermentation requires covering a vegetable \u2014 whole, cut up or shredded \u2014 with a brine solution. (Brine is a fancy word for salty water.) Examples of fermentation include sauerkraut and cortido. (Also kombucha and yogurt, although clearly they are not vegetable-based.)\n\nFermentation is the oldest form of food preservation, and while simple to do, it's a bit of a lost art. Essentially the pH from salt content inhibits the growth of any pathogens, assuming the vegetables are not in contact with air. (Many force food/contents down, under brine, by using a rolled up cabbage leaf, or weights of some kind, usually glass or ceramic.)\n\nFermentation usually imparts a tart flavor, often interpreted as sour. The longer you ferment, the more tart the result. When it reaches the level that you enjoy, you must refrigerate to slow down / stop fermentation. \n\nbtw, Fermentation is sometimes referred to as \"controlled rot.\" \ud83d\ude01 If you want to try your hand, I highly recommend looking up Sandor Katz, a fermentation enthusiast who brought the art back to the Western world. Plenty of free recipes on the web, or check out your favorite library for his books.\n\nbtw, do not discount the use of grape leaves or oak leaves in recipes for pickled cucumbers! The tannic acid they release helps cucumbers from getting mushy. Also some people cut off the blossom end because of that issue. \n\nNo matter the method(s) you try, best of luck!", "Just use kosher salt, easiest to find and works well.

I pretty much used a brine of 1 cup apple cider vinegar, i cup distilled water, and 1 TBSP of sea salt.  I then added mustard seed, fresh dill, some crushed whole garlic, coriander seed, black peppercorns, and a bit of calcium chloride.  I put a few grape leaves at the top before sealing the jars and canning them.\n\nPic two which is the vlassic pickle jug is just good old fashioned boston pickling cucumbers with the same brine and ingredients as above.  I didn't can these, just pickled them with hot brine and fucked them off into the fridge after they cooled.\n\nPic three is a complete and total test.  The jar on the left is a pickling with all the same ingredients as above and not canned just right into the fridge.  It has pickling and persian cucumbers ... pretty much all the left overs since it was a gallon jar.  The jar on the right is all the same stuff as the jar on the left except I didn't use vinegar and I'm going to ferment them.  I'm curious how more or less the same recipe and cucs taste when compared to pickling and fermenting.\n\nPic four is also a total test.  The red jar on the left is fermented red cabbage kimchi.  I mashed it with salt in its own juices, added diakon, and other stuff, calcium chloride, a bunch of gochugaru, and popped on a fermentation top.  The jar on the right is the total wildcard.  That is fermented collard greens ... no idea what is going to happen there.\n\nAll of the pickled stuff is a apple cider vinegar brine.  All of the fermented stuff is either just a brine or a pounding in its own juice.  I used calcium chloride in all the jars.\n\nLastly I also made fermented beets but I forgot to take pics of that.\n\nHope this shit works.

{"title": "Pickling eggs questions", "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm getting ready to pickle some eggs and I read through everything I could find on the internet. \n\nAlso read some egg recipes in \"[The Joy of Pickling](https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Pickling-Flavor-Packed-Recipes-Vegetables/dp/1558323759)\" that, seemed quite odd to me, mentioned poking the eggs 6 times with a fork from white all the way to yolk for the brine to penetrate easier.\n\nNow, I plan on making some, and by the guidelines mentioned here ([NCHFP](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/pickle/pickled-eggs/pickled-eggs/)), I plan on refrigerating the jars right away, but I want to ask you the following:\n\n1. Can I use a variety of vegetables in the jars? I mean, I see quite a lot of recipes, and everyone is giving their take on pickled eggs. From reading and reading on the internet, I always see \"follow tested recipes\". Is refrigerated pickles more forgiving on that aspect? Can I put carrots, beets, cucumbers, onions, some hot peppers... or whatever I want (vegetables) with the eggs and have no problem with them?\n\n2. Should I sterilize the jars before putting in the eggs? I see some guide mention sterilized jars before putting the eggs (that are presumed cold by now, after the ice bath to peel them), and pouring room temperature vinegar/brine on them. Others mention no jar sterilization but put boiling/hot brine on them in the jar. So which way would you say is \"more correct\". From my understanding, people are \"sterilizing\" the jars by either putting them in boiling water or by pouring hot brine in them.\n\n3. Are there any tips/tricks to make this safer? Pickling something other than vegetables seems very daunting to me. Especially since it will be the first time I'm doing it. What should I avoid, cracked eggs for example? The book I mentioned before said \"poke them willingly\" instead of \"be careful not to have a broken egg\" or something. Should I be absolutely sure the egg is INTACT and if the white broke a bit, well... eat it then and there and not pickle it? Or it doesn't matter.\n\n4. Are there any WARNING SIGNS that things go or have gone bad? I mean, I have been wanting to try pickled eggs for months now, but botulism stories and warnings online kept me back from making them. Botulism toxin, no smell, no color, no taste, well, F\\*\\*\\* me, am I supposed to pickle Russian roulette. So is there an indication I'm not doing things right? Color, or eggs floating, or sinking, I don't know. I just want a peace of mind.\n\n  \nThank you for reading! It's been a hard time on this subject (pickling eggs) because I try to tackle the problem from all sides to make sure someone doesn't get sick, and seems like a mountain to climb. Especially for the first time because there is no experience.\n\nPS.

Refrigerator pickles are very forgiving since it's a high acid brine from the vinegar kept below 40 degrees so both parts keep the food in a safe state. It is possible to grow mold but unlikely unless the items being pickled are exposed to air. Any other veggies  you pickle with eggs will taste eggy so I don't recommend adding anything that isn't to enhance the eggs themself (onion, garlic, peppers, etc)\n\n2. If you want to go ahead but as long as it's clean it's safe for fridge pickles nothing else you put in will be sterile so sterilizing the jar isn't necessary. \n\n3. It's generally safe no real risk of any food born illnesses unless you're using spoiled food already. One thing about pickled eggs if you don't let them sit in the fridge very long you'll end up with a ring of pickled egg on the outside of the white and basically just a standard hard boiled egg on the inside, this is why some recipes suggest piercing the white so the brine can reach the inside quicker. You don't have to pierce them it just gets them ready to eat sooner otherwise pickle them and leave them alone for 2 or 3 weeks so the brine can work it's way inside. The last confirmed case of botulism in pickled eggs was caused by the guy piercing the eggs with a wooden skewer and not refrigerating them which gave a place for the botulism to grow(the yolks). Broken eggs and pieced yolks can cause the brine to look milky from the yolk breaking down in the brine, it's safe to eat just kind of ugly.\n\n4. You'll know if it goes bad. If it smells bad or tastes bad throw it out and try again. \n\nIt's really pretty simple and a lot to experiment with to get different flavors.
