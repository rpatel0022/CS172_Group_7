{"title": "I experimented with hundreds of dollars of steak so you don\u2019t have to.", "selftext": "A few years ago I set out to become better at making food/drinks at home. I accepted that spending a bunch of money on things like coffee, steak, and other more expensive foods would be worth it in the long run if I perfected them so that I could save money by making it at home when I craved it instead of a restaurant. \n\nMy dad\u2019s favorite dish has always been steak and although he isn\u2019t regularly going to high end steakhouses every night, he has experienced them enough to have a high bar. \n\nHere are a few things that I learned along the way that surprised me. \n\n1. Freezing a steak turned out more tender once thawed and cooked than just putting a fresh steak into the sous vide.\n2. 137 seems to be the ideal temperate that makes every party the most happy if you have guests with different preferences for doneness.\n3. If your steaks are frozen, letting it thaw for 1-2 days in your fridge before you put it in the sous vide made it more tender than dropping it in from frozen. \n4. Extremely high heat wasn\u2019t necessary to make a good crust. \n5. 3-4 hours is most ideal for bath time.\n\nI have had every friend and family member that tried my steak say it is the best they ever had. This was particularly nice when my dad finally said it and now asks me to make him steak on his birthday instead of going out for it. \n\nMy method is as follows:\n\nI typically buy a rib section from a local store. You can often find sales at larger retailers around Christmas and July 4th for $5-$6 per pound. I cut these into the desired steak size and vacuum seal them. \n\nWhen I know I will want steak in a couple days, I take them out of the freezer and into the fridge for 2 days roughly. When it comes time to sous vide, I season them with just kosher salt generously on all sides. On a ribeye there is a little triangle piece that is mostly fat. I cut this off and set it aside. I drop the seasoned steak into a 137\u00b0F bath. I aim for 3-4 hours bath time. \n\nOnce I\u2019m ready to start the process of getting it ready to eat I put the steak into an ice bath. Typically it will stay in there for about 10 minutes. I\u2019m really not rushed as the ice bath is meant to cool it down quite a lot. While it\u2019s in the ice bath I grab my stainless steel skillet and put it on medium heat on the stove top. I grab that triangle piece of fat from earlier and throw it in the pan so it can render down and be the base of what I will sear the steak in. \n\nI remove the steak from the vacuum sealed bag and pat it dry the best I can. Then I put it into the pan. The pan isn\u2019t ripping hot but it\u2019s certainly hot enough to get a sear going with this liquid fat. Once I put the steak in the pan, I add butter to the pan as well. I count to 30 in my head before flipping the steak over. After 30 seconds I flip it again. Then after 30 more seconds on each side, I grab the steak with tongs and sear the edges all the way around. After this I drop it back into the pan and count to 20 for each side, then 15 for each side, then I finish off with flipping every 5-10 seconds until the crust looks exactly how I want it. \n\nOnce I take the steak off the pan, I put a homemade compound butter on top of it so it will melt. The compound butter I use is 1 stick of salted butter, parsley, dill and garlic. I make this in advance then store it in the freezer. When I make steaks I take it out of the freezer and cut off thin little disks and that is what I melt on top of my steaks. \n\nI usually serve the steak with a salad and either mashed potatoes or corn on the cob. \n\nThe process sounds more complicated than it actually is. It\u2019s pretty simple when you do it once or twice. But this was also years and at least 50 steaks experimenting until I got it the exact way that I now like it every time. \n\n\nEDIT: to clarify something. When searing it, it will take some fine tuning to get the final product how you want it. The ice bath cools it down so it stops the cooking process. This will also help make the gray band on the final product mostly non-existent. You may find the inside of the steak cooler than you prefer. If that is the case, take a little more time on the searing step since you don\u2019t really run the risk of over cooking it unless you a basically take as long as you would on a raw steak.

Nothing special, from Safeway. Seasoned like usual with S&P, then spread maybe 3 TB of Skippy smooth peanut butter on top. 131 for 2.5 hrs, REMOVED THE PB, patted dry, then seared on the grill.\n\nI have no idea how or why this worked, but I don't give AF. It was AMAZING. DO IT.\n\nEdit: Removing the PB before sear!\n\nEdit 2: Now that this has blown up, I should probably give a shoutout to u/SVEMauMau and say thank you to the whole crew for doing what you do.

{"title": "Sous Vide ruined most steakhouses for me...", "selftext": "So I've been on the sous vide train for years now, and I've taken clients out to nice restaurants plenty of times (well, at least pre-pandemic), so this phenomenon isn't new to me. But it was just reinforced this weekend, and it makes me almost a little sad.\n\n\nI had a couple of friends come into town and we had decided that we'd cap off the day with a visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak. Cool restaurant, great vibe, fantastic cocktails. My friends all decide to get the Beef Wellington, seeing as it's one of Ramsay's most well-known dishes, and I nearly pull the trigger as well until I see that the menu has American Wagyu cuts. $98 for either a 8oz filet or 12oz delmonico, guaranteed to have marbling grade 9 or higher. Well I've never had a straight up wagyu steak, even the American version, so I figured I'd get that while I had the chance.\n\nSo I ordered the American Wagyu Delmonico, medium rare, and said just simple seasoning and none of the sauces they have so I can see how the steak itself tastes. Came out with a great sear, perfectly cooked, although they decided to put some [rabbit food on top for some reason](https://i.imgur.com/LJASD5n.jpg).\n\nSo I cut into it, take a bite and....it's steak. It's good, but it's not fantastic. Tasty, juicy, perfectly cooked, but not what I was expecting from something with the wagyu label (even if it's an American knockoff) and paid that much for. I've had cuts I've gotten from the grocery store, let age in packaging for a few days, and then sous vide that I enjoyed a bit more than the steakhouse steak. And don't get me started on a nice picanha from the local butcher, this steak didn't hold a candle to a picanha.\n\nI'm not blasting Gordon Ramsay Steak by any means, it's still a great restaurant that I'd recommend for a special occasion. The steak was still a tasty meal, and the sides, desserts, and cocktails are fantastic. But as with many other steakhouses, sous vide has raised my bar too high to recommend getting a steak from there if you regularly cook them at home yourself. Sure, if you're like me you definitely don't *consistently* cook steaks on that level, but you remember the ones you knocked out of the park. And it's just somewhat disappointing when the steakhouse doesn't quite match up.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/x1xz8g/sous_vide_ruined_most_steakhouses_for_me/", "created_utc": 1661902240.0, "score": 417, "author": "acedelgado", "num_comments": 183, "permalink": "/r/sousvide/comments/x1xz8g/sous_vide_ruined_most_steakhouses_for_me/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Just Ate A Steak Straight From The Bag", "selftext": "So, I've been drinking. I was getting pretty hungry and my 2 options were to spend $25+ on Uber Eats, or to cook a vacuum sealed prime NY strip I had in the freezer. I opted to cook the NY strip sous vide. The fact that I'm drunk had me hesitant to use my blow torch for safety reasons or to try to sear the steak in a pan for fear of overlooking due to my current decreased reaction speed. So I took the steak straight from the bag to a plate and started to eat it. It was certainly less enjoyable than it would have been with a nice sear on it, however it was still quite enjoyable in my hungry, drunken state.

{"title": "Michelin star restaurant chicken breast", "selftext": "A lot of people seem to hate sous vide chicken breast so I thought I'd chime in with the method used by Eleven Madison Park, one of the highest rated restaurants in the world. \n\nServes 8:\n\n* 4 boneless chicken breasts, skin on \n\n* 2 teaspoons salt \n\n* 4 springs of thyme \n\nSeason the chicken evenly on both sides with salt. Place 1 sprig of thyme on the skinless side of the breasts. Place each breast in a sous vide bag and vacuum seal. Cook in a water bath maintained at 145\u00b0 for 25-30 minutes \n\nTo finish \n\n* 2 tablespoons canola oil \n\n* 1/4 cup browned butter \n\n* fleur de sel \n\nDivide the canola oil between 2 large saute pans over high heat. Place the 2 breasts in each pan, skin side down, and lower the heat to medium-low.sear and render the fat from the skin for 2 minutes, until golden and crisp. Remove from the pan and allow to rest for 1 minute. Trim off the sides and slice each breast in half lengthwise. Brush with brown butter and season with fleur de sel. \n\nSome notes: \n\nthey use diamond crystal salt, so if you're using Morton you'll have to reduce the amount of salt. \n\nI pound the breast so it's uniformly thick so it sears better. \n\n\nI hope you all enjoy and give it a go. It's the best chicken I've ever had, doesn't get rubbery like most other sous vide chicken, and the browned butter makes for an incredible flavor.

They were okay, I guess, but the inside was a pale pink color, not the typical vibrant red I get when I follow the exact same method I always do for filets. Additionally, the meat lacked the usual beefy flavor. It was underwhelming, but still edible. I did 131.5\u00b0 for two hours, my usual time and temp. Finally, the steaks had a sort of weird look to them upon cutting? Like the grain of the meat was really defined, or muscle fibers might be a better way to describe. To me, it tasted and looked over cooked. Here is my process in total:\n\nI buy the steaks in bulk, vacuum seal individually. Freeze. These specific steaks were bought April 12th, so not even a month in the freezer. \nThaw in cold water. Once steaks are thawed, set sous vide to 131.5\u00b0 x 2 hours. Add steaks. \nAfter 2 hours, place in ice bath while I make sides\u2026 maybe 20 minutes? Remove from bag to let oxygen get to them, dry and season. Sear in hot stainless steel pan in butter. Plate. \n\nI know about the blooming process and how if you slice it and let it rest, the red color comes to it. And that did happen for some pieces. But the flavor was just mediocre, and I specifically bought these steaks because of the decent marbling on them (for filets). This is the same process I always use, and I did double check my sous vide via instant thermometer probably 5-6 cooks ago and it was accurate, within a half a degree.

{"title": "Strip Loin Roast", "selftext": "Decided to try out a strip loin roast for Easter this year. I started by cutting a 4 pound section and then trimming the fat cap evenly to about \u00bc inch. I then scored the fat cap and put on a rub I made of 1% salt (by weight, so about 18 grams), black pepper, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. I let that dry brine in the fridge for about 24 hours. I seared the roast on all sides, then threw some shallot, a couple of thyme sprigs, and a rosemary spring into the pan to fry in the drippings. I deglazed with \u00bd cup red wine, and reduced all of that together until it was a thick glaze. I then poured that over top the seared roast, and bagged it. It went into the water at 136\u00b0 for 6 hours. When it was done, I made the same exact rub again, this time adding 2 teaspoons of red wine vinegar to make it into a paste. I dried off the roast and rubbed the paste on and stuck it into a 450\u00b0 oven for about 15 minutes. Served it with a jus made from the bag juice, 2 cups beef stock, and \u00bc cup red wine that I reduced to about half. \n\nOverall the guests were very impressed and loved every bite of it.

It was like $90 and I liked it because it had no bells and whistles. Simple\u2014 seal, vacuum. I\u2019ve had it for over a year. Worked fine. I use food saver bags. The other day I made filets and they were\u2026. Weird. For reference these were 7-8 oz 1.5\u201d thick filets, so they were in the bath at 130\u00b0 for two hours (my normal time and temp). They were just a little strange tasting, and the color was off. If I had to be descriptive, it tasted boiled. It dawned on me later that it\u2019s possible water got in the bags. Never noticed them floating, but they were in a rack. Since then, I have made probably 5-6 more things in the sous vide without incident. Tonight, I had two pounds of pork butt in for carnitas. About two hours in, I checked on them and noticed the bag floating. Uh oh. I take it out and notice the tiniest break in the seal. Tossed the meat unfortunately as I have no interest in eating waterlogged meat that\u2019s got air in the bag. Of course I\u2019ll inspect my sealer tray/strip, but I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll just spend a little more on a nicer vacuum sealer. My question is \u2014 what are you using? Does anyone double seal? How can I prevent this? I always check the seal, but this was so minor I doubt I would have caught it. I host dinner parties often, and all I keep thinking is what if I had people over? What if this was a $140 tenderloin and not $7 worth of pork? Any recommendations or tips are appreciated.

I accepted that spending a bunch of money on things like coffee, steak, and other more expensive foods would be worth it in the long run if I perfected them so that I could save money by making it at home when I craved it instead of a restaurant. \n\nMy dad\u2019s favorite dish has always been steak and although he isn\u2019t regularly going to high end steakhouses every night, he has experienced them enough to have a high bar. \n\nHere are a few things that I learned along the way that surprised me. \n\n1. Freezing a steak turned out more tender once thawed and cooked than just putting a fresh steak into the sous vide.\n2. 137 seems to be the ideal temperate that makes every party the most happy if you have guests with different preferences for doneness.\n3. If your steaks are frozen, letting it thaw for 1-2 days in your fridge before you put it in the sous vide made it more tender than dropping it in from frozen. \n4. Extremely high heat wasn\u2019t necessary to make a good crust. \n5. 3-4 hours is most ideal for bath time.\n\nI have had every friend and family member that tried my steak say it is the best they ever had. This was particularly nice when my dad finally said it and now asks me to make him steak on his birthday instead of going out for it. \n\nMy method is as follows:\n\nI typically buy a rib section from a local store. You can often find sales at larger retailers around Christmas and July 4th for $5-$6 per pound. I cut these into the desired steak size and vacuum seal them. \n\nWhen I know I will want steak in a couple days, I take them out of the freezer and into the fridge for 2 days roughly. When it comes time to sous vide, I season them with just kosher salt generously on all sides. On a ribeye there is a little triangle piece that is mostly fat. I cut this off and set it aside. I drop the seasoned steak into a 137\u00b0F bath. I aim for 3-4 hours bath time. \n\nOnce I\u2019m ready to start the process of getting it ready to eat I put the steak into an ice bath. Typically it will stay in there for about 10 minutes. I\u2019m really not rushed as the ice bath is meant to cool it down quite a lot. While it\u2019s in the ice bath I grab my stainless steel skillet and put it on medium heat on the stove top. I grab that triangle piece of fat from earlier and throw it in the pan so it can render down and be the base of what I will sear the steak in. \n\nI remove the steak from the vacuum sealed bag and pat it dry the best I can. Then I put it into the pan. The pan isn\u2019t ripping hot but it\u2019s certainly hot enough to get a sear going with this liquid fat. Once I put the steak in the pan, I add butter to the pan as well. I count to 30 in my head before flipping the steak over. After 30 seconds I flip it again. Then after 30 more seconds on each side, I grab the steak with tongs and sear the edges all the way around. After this I drop it back into the pan and count to 20 for each side, then 15 for each side, then I finish off with flipping every 5-10 seconds until the crust looks exactly how I want it. \n\nOnce I take the steak off the pan, I put a homemade compound butter on top of it so it will melt. The compound butter I use is 1 stick of salted butter, parsley, dill and garlic. I make this in advance then store it in the freezer. When I make steaks I take it out of the freezer and cut off thin little disks and that is what I melt on top of my steaks. \n\nI usually serve the steak with a salad and either mashed potatoes or corn on the cob. \n\nThe process sounds more complicated than it actually is. It\u2019s pretty simple when you do it once or twice. But this was also years and at least 50 steaks experimenting until I got it the exact way that I now like it every time. \n\n\nEDIT: to clarify something. When searing it, it will take some fine tuning to get the final product how you want it. The ice bath cools it down so it stops the cooking process. This will also help make the gray band on the final product mostly non-existent. You may find the inside of the steak cooler than you prefer. If that is the case, take a little more time on the searing step since you don\u2019t really run the risk of over cooking it unless you a basically take as long as you would on a raw steak.

{"title": "Question about Pasteurizing Black Garlic in Sous Vide for Safety", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been making black garlic following the recipe from *The Noma Guide to Fermentation*. It\u2019s been in my dehydrator since February 1st and is getting close to being done.\n\nFor extra safety, I\u2019m considering pasteurizing it in my sous vide machine before storage. I want to make sure it\u2019s completely safe to eat and free from any potential harmful bacteria.\n\nMy concern is that the dehydrator I\u2019m using has a feature called *Dry Balance Technology*, which allows the temperature to fluctuate by +/- 5\u00b0C. This helps with even dehydration, but it also means the garlic hasn\u2019t been held at a constant 60\u00b0C throughout the entire process. Additionally, about three weeks into fermentation, I discovered that the dehydrator had been off for approximately 8 hours before I noticed and turned it back on.\n\nGiven these factors, would pasteurizing in sous vide be a good precaution? If so, what temperature and duration would be ideal to ensure safety without affecting the final quality of the black garlic? Or is pasteurization unnecessary as long as there\u2019s no visible mold or spoilage?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/1j43x95/question_about_pasteurizing_black_garlic_in_sous/", "created_utc": 1741183830.0, "score": 1, "author": "HotelKind7531", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/sousvide/comments/1j43x95/question_about_pasteurizing_black_garlic_in_sous/", "html_title": ""}

But I might need to adjust time to ensure the target temp is reached for long enough.

Cook sous vide to 185\u00b0 then grill to 195\u00b0\nThanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/1is4za5/want_to_prepare_smoked_and_vac_sealed_ribs_for/", "created_utc": 1739855073.0, "score": 1, "author": "closecall334", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/sousvide/comments/1is4za5/want_to_prepare_smoked_and_vac_sealed_ribs_for/", "html_title": ""}

The two things that really alluded me, compared to cooking on my grill, was getting a good enough sear on things so that the fat was edible and getting the right amount of seasoning.  For my sear, I have been using a cast iron skillet with butter, on super high, and putting the seasoning on when I seared.  I also tried using my oven's broiler, and I just couldn't get happy with it.  I have seen several people post about using a torch to sear and man what a difference!  I made seriously one of the best steaks I have ever eaten, let alone cooked.  I cooked NY Strip @ 137 for about 5 hours, from frozen even.  I put a small amount of butter in with them.  At the 5 hour mark, I took them out patted them dry, put some Lawry's on it, then hit hard with a torch. After torching I was worried I burnt the heck out of them, but I put some butter on each side and some Montreal steak seasoning.  Honestly, if realized they would be as amazing as they were, I would have taken pictures.  Tender, delicious, the inside perfect, and the outside with a nice crispy shell and the fat was delicious.

{"title": "Can we get moister interior results by slowly ramping temperature (hours) on sous vide? Could not find testing info anywhere.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve had my Anova sous vide now about 8 years I think, give or take, love the results I get with it (the things I do most are thick steaks, roasts, and custardy yolked eggs actually. Also hot dogs believe it or not).\n\nThinking long and hard about sous vide technique and the big difference in my conventional briskets and the sous vide briskets, not just in terms of the outside, but the interior cooking resulting in a dryer interior with the sous vide. Also I think about the anemic  direct penetration of seasoning (even salt) into the sous vide roasts compared to other cooking methods, regardless of how many hours I sous vide, say, a chuck roast.\n\nGot me to thinking about it,and it seems to me that the conventional way of thinking of sous vide as this controlled and \u201cgentle\u201d way of cooking food is not correct at all. \n\nSous vide is (if you don\u2019t count microwave or boiling) one of the most VIOLENT and controlled methods of slow cooking food, especially the interior. When you sous vide something to 155 then holding it there, you are taking a roast that was sitting at 40 degrees in your fridge, and ramping it up to 155 in time periods of well under an hour. This is much faster than any conventional low and slow method (200-300 oven or smoker over long periods result in interior temperature changes of 10 degrees taking hours)  and makes me wonder if this rapid expansion period results in the extra water loss and the lack of seasoning penetration. \n\nEven if you sous vide from room temperature water, the water and roast achieve a \u201ccooked temperature\u201d really really fast compared to any slow cook. Does anybody else think that the rapid heating/expansion phase of sous vide may contribute to some of the weaknesses of sous vide cooking? I have not read anything that even considers this as a potential issue. \n\nAnd has anybody ever EXPERIMENTED with slower ramping of sous vide temperatures in long cooks? I know some sous vide devices have fancy programming capabilities, so it might be easier than on mine to try this.

Additionally, the meat lacked the usual beefy flavor. It was underwhelming, but still edible. I did 131.5\u00b0 for two hours, my usual time and temp.

These specific steaks were bought April 12th, so not even a month in the freezer. \nThaw in cold water. Once steaks are thawed, set sous vide to 131.5\u00b0 x 2 hours.

But the flavor was just mediocre, and I specifically bought these steaks because of the decent marbling on them (for filets).

{"title": "Strip Loin Roast", "selftext": "Decided to try out a strip loin roast for Easter this year. I started by cutting a 4 pound section and then trimming the fat cap evenly to about \u00bc inch. I then scored the fat cap and put on a rub I made of 1% salt (by weight, so about 18 grams), black pepper, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. I let that dry brine in the fridge for about 24 hours. I seared the roast on all sides, then threw some shallot, a couple of thyme sprigs, and a rosemary spring into the pan to fry in the drippings. I deglazed with \u00bd cup red wine, and reduced all of that together until it was a thick glaze. I then poured that over top the seared roast, and bagged it. It went into the water at 136\u00b0 for 6 hours. When it was done, I made the same exact rub again, this time adding 2 teaspoons of red wine vinegar to make it into a paste. I dried off the roast and rubbed the paste on and stuck it into a 450\u00b0 oven for about 15 minutes. Served it with a jus made from the bag juice, 2 cups beef stock, and \u00bc cup red wine that I reduced to about half. \n\nOverall the guests were very impressed and loved every bite of it. I personally think it had too much black pepper from the double application, which also scorched a bit during the sear, which was a noob mistake that I should have never let happen. It didn't ruin the flavor but it brought the quality down, in my opinion. I also wasn't wild about the jus and wish I had just made a red wine reduction instead with the bag juice.

Since it is sadly also skinless, do you think I can sub chicken skin for turkey? \n\n  \nThanks in advance.

It was like $90 and I liked it because it had no bells and whistles. Simple\u2014 seal, vacuum. I\u2019ve had it for over a year. Worked fine. I use food saver bags. The other day I made filets and they were\u2026. Weird. For reference these were 7-8 oz 1.5\u201d thick filets, so they were in the bath at 130\u00b0 for two hours (my normal time and temp). They were just a little strange tasting, and the color was off. If I had to be descriptive, it tasted boiled. It dawned on me later that it\u2019s possible water got in the bags. Never noticed them floating, but they were in a rack. Since then, I have made probably 5-6 more things in the sous vide without incident. Tonight, I had two pounds of pork butt in for carnitas. About two hours in, I checked on them and noticed the bag floating. Uh oh. I take it out and notice the tiniest break in the seal. Tossed the meat unfortunately as I have no interest in eating waterlogged meat that\u2019s got air in the bag. Of course I\u2019ll inspect my sealer tray/strip, but I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll just spend a little more on a nicer vacuum sealer. My question is \u2014 what are you using? Does anyone double seal? How can I prevent this? I always check the seal, but this was so minor I doubt I would have caught it. I host dinner parties often, and all I keep thinking is what if I had people over? What if this was a $140 tenderloin and not $7 worth of pork? Any recommendations or tips are appreciated.

{"title": "Question about Pasteurizing Black Garlic in Sous Vide for Safety", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been making black garlic following the recipe from *The Noma Guide to Fermentation*. It\u2019s been in my dehydrator since February 1st and is getting close to being done.\n\nFor extra safety, I\u2019m considering pasteurizing it in my sous vide machine before storage. I want to make sure it\u2019s completely safe to eat and free from any potential harmful bacteria.\n\nMy concern is that the dehydrator I\u2019m using has a feature called *Dry Balance Technology*, which allows the temperature to fluctuate by +/- 5\u00b0C. This helps with even dehydration, but it also means the garlic hasn\u2019t been held at a constant 60\u00b0C throughout the entire process. Additionally, about three weeks into fermentation, I discovered that the dehydrator had been off for approximately 8 hours before I noticed and turned it back on.\n\nGiven these factors, would pasteurizing in sous vide be a good precaution? If so, what temperature and duration would be ideal to ensure safety without affecting the final quality of the black garlic? Or is pasteurization unnecessary as long as there\u2019s no visible mold or spoilage?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/1j43x95/question_about_pasteurizing_black_garlic_in_sous/", "created_utc": 1741183830.0, "score": 1, "author": "HotelKind7531", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/sousvide/comments/1j43x95/question_about_pasteurizing_black_garlic_in_sous/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I experimented with hundreds of dollars of steak so you don\u2019t have to.", "selftext": "A few years ago I set out to become better at making food/drinks at home. I accepted that spending a bunch of money on things like coffee, steak, and other more expensive foods would be worth it in the long run if I perfected them so that I could save money by making it at home when I craved it instead of a restaurant. \n\nMy dad\u2019s favorite dish has always been steak and although he isn\u2019t regularly going to high end steakhouses every night, he has experienced them enough to have a high bar. \n\nHere are a few things that I learned along the way that surprised me. \n\n1. Freezing a steak turned out more tender once thawed and cooked than just putting a fresh steak into the sous vide.\n2. 137 seems to be the ideal temperate that makes every party the most happy if you have guests with different preferences for doneness.\n3. If your steaks are frozen, letting it thaw for 1-2 days in your fridge before you put it in the sous vide made it more tender than dropping it in from frozen. \n4. Extremely high heat wasn\u2019t necessary to make a good crust. \n5. 3-4 hours is most ideal for bath time.\n\nI have had every friend and family member that tried my steak say it is the best they ever had. This was particularly nice when my dad finally said it and now asks me to make him steak on his birthday instead of going out for it. \n\nMy method is as follows:\n\nI typically buy a rib section from a local store. You can often find sales at larger retailers around Christmas and July 4th for $5-$6 per pound. I cut these into the desired steak size and vacuum seal them. \n\nWhen I know I will want steak in a couple days, I take them out of the freezer and into the fridge for 2 days roughly. When it comes time to sous vide, I season them with just kosher salt generously on all sides. On a ribeye there is a little triangle piece that is mostly fat. I cut this off and set it aside. I drop the seasoned steak into a 137\u00b0F bath. I aim for 3-4 hours bath time. \n\nOnce I\u2019m ready to start the process of getting it ready to eat I put the steak into an ice bath. Typically it will stay in there for about 10 minutes. I\u2019m really not rushed as the ice bath is meant to cool it down quite a lot. While it\u2019s in the ice bath I grab my stainless steel skillet and put it on medium heat on the stove top. I grab that triangle piece of fat from earlier and throw it in the pan so it can render down and be the base of what I will sear the steak in. \n\nI remove the steak from the vacuum sealed bag and pat it dry the best I can. Then I put it into the pan. The pan isn\u2019t ripping hot but it\u2019s certainly hot enough to get a sear going with this liquid fat. Once I put the steak in the pan, I add butter to the pan as well. I count to 30 in my head before flipping the steak over. After 30 seconds I flip it again. Then after 30 more seconds on each side, I grab the steak with tongs and sear the edges all the way around. After this I drop it back into the pan and count to 20 for each side, then 15 for each side, then I finish off with flipping every 5-10 seconds until the crust looks exactly how I want it. \n\nOnce I take the steak off the pan, I put a homemade compound butter on top of it so it will melt. The compound butter I use is 1 stick of salted butter, parsley, dill and garlic. I make this in advance then store it in the freezer. When I make steaks I take it out of the freezer and cut off thin little disks and that is what I melt on top of my steaks. \n\nI usually serve the steak with a salad and either mashed potatoes or corn on the cob. \n\nThe process sounds more complicated than it actually is. It\u2019s pretty simple when you do it once or twice. But this was also years and at least 50 steaks experimenting until I got it the exact way that I now like it every time. \n\n\nEDIT: to clarify something. When searing it, it will take some fine tuning to get the final product how you want it. The ice bath cools it down so it stops the cooking process. This will also help make the gray band on the final product mostly non-existent. You may find the inside of the steak cooler than you prefer. If that is the case, take a little more time on the searing step since you don\u2019t really run the risk of over cooking it unless you a basically take as long as you would on a raw steak.

{"title": "Voila!", "selftext": "I have finally cracked the code!  I have been cooking sous vide since last summer, to modest success.  The two things that really alluded me, compared to cooking on my grill, was getting a good enough sear on things so that the fat was edible and getting the right amount of seasoning.  For my sear, I have been using a cast iron skillet with butter, on super high, and putting the seasoning on when I seared.  I also tried using my oven's broiler, and I just couldn't get happy with it.  I have seen several people post about using a torch to sear and man what a difference!  I made seriously one of the best steaks I have ever eaten, let alone cooked.  I cooked NY Strip @ 137 for about 5 hours, from frozen even.  I put a small amount of butter in with them.  At the 5 hour mark, I took them out patted them dry, put some Lawry's on it, then hit hard with a torch. After torching I was worried I burnt the heck out of them, but I put some butter on each side and some Montreal steak seasoning.  Honestly, if realized they would be as amazing as they were, I would have taken pictures.  Tender, delicious, the inside perfect, and the outside with a nice crispy shell and the fat was delicious.   Also the torch didn't fill my garage with smoke.  I am never going back.  Hope this helps someone else that is struggling with that final step.

Could not find testing info anywhere.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve had my Anova sous vide now about 8 years I think, give or take, love the results I get with it (the things I do most are thick steaks, roasts, and custardy yolked eggs actually. Also hot dogs believe it or not).\n\nThinking long and hard about sous vide technique and the big difference in my conventional briskets and the sous vide briskets, not just in terms of the outside, but the interior cooking resulting in a dryer interior with the sous vide. Also I think about the anemic  direct penetration of seasoning (even salt) into the sous vide roasts compared to other cooking methods, regardless of how many hours I sous vide, say, a chuck roast.\n\nGot me to thinking about it,and it seems to me that the conventional way of thinking of sous vide as this controlled and \u201cgentle\u201d way of cooking food is not correct at all. \n\nSous vide is (if you don\u2019t count microwave or boiling) one of the most VIOLENT and controlled methods of slow cooking food, especially the interior. When you sous vide something to 155 then holding it there, you are taking a roast that was sitting at 40 degrees in your fridge, and ramping it up to 155 in time periods of well under an hour. This is much faster than any conventional low and slow method (200-300 oven or smoker over long periods result in interior temperature changes of 10 degrees taking hours)  and makes me wonder if this rapid expansion period results in the extra water loss and the lack of seasoning penetration. \n\nEven if you sous vide from room temperature water, the water and roast achieve a \u201ccooked temperature\u201d really really fast compared to any slow cook. Does anybody else think that the rapid heating/expansion phase of sous vide may contribute to some of the weaknesses of sous vide cooking? I have not read anything that even considers this as a potential issue. \n\nAnd has anybody ever EXPERIMENTED with slower ramping of sous vide temperatures in long cooks?

I have never done a chuck roast with SV so I came to this community for ideas.  It seemed the majority are doing theirs at 135\u00b0F-137\u00b0F for 24-48 hours.  I decided on 135\u00b0F for 36 hours.  It seemed like the best middle ground.  I saw someone commented they like coating their chuck with beef Better Than Bouillon and Montreal steak seasoning so I tried that.  I used my flamethrower for the sear after drying and letting the chuck sit in the frig for 15 min.  I also made an au jus and horseradish sauce to pair with the chuck.  The au jus was made with the bag juices, water, beef Better Than Bouillon, paprika, thyme, oregano, Worcestershire, and red wine vinegar.  The horseradish sauce had horseradish puree, mayo, sour cream, and dijon mustard.  The bag juices au jus was pretty salty but tasted great with the chuck slices, broccoli, and rice.  The spicy horseradish sauce was outstanding with fatty pieces of chuck.  The star was appropriately the chuck roast.  This was like a great prime rib.  Same texture, juicy, fatty and outstanding sauces elevated it all.  \n\nA big thanks is due to the community for sharing their experiences that shaped how this went.  I will try my next chuck at 137\u00b0F for 48 hours next to compare the two.
