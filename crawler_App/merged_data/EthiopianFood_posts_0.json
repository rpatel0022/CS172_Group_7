{"title": "I FINALLY got a sampler plate for a local Ethiopian spot, and it is absolutely yummy.", "selftext": "I got lots of injera, spiced rice, Chicken Doro Wot, Kik Alicha Wot, Fosolia, Shiro Wot, Gomen, Key Sir, Atkilt, Beef Key Wot and Lamb Alicha Wot. \n\n~~~\n\nSpiced Rice - It has saffron,cardamom, allspice berries and clove, it's fragrant and nicely spiced. Very good with the spread served.\n\nInjera - Fascinating texture and flavor. It's *stretchy* like some type of elastic material, but also soft and spongey. The flavor is pleasantly sour that would work well with savory or sweet dishes.\n\nChicken Doro Wot - Exceptional. That's really all there is to say, this was an excellent stew with rich flavor and nicely spiced. Just a little kick of heat. This is tied for my 2nd favorite dish.\n\nKik Alicha Wot - Incredibly delicious. I'd 100% add this to my homecooking rotation, it's an absolutely perfect stew for yellow split peas. This is also tied for my 2nd favorite dish from the sampler.\n\nFosolia - Excellent side dish. Very savory and flavorful, but not heavy. I almost polished off both the fosolia and kik alicha wot on the first go, they're fantastic.\n\nShiro Wot - This is #1. I don't know how shiro wot is typically eaten, but I'd happily eat a bowl of this with injera and call it a day. I cannot believe it's made from chickpea flour, it's like a savory, hot hummus without sesame, but thinner and so so so so so much more flavorful and yummy. Chickpeas really held their own here.\n\nGomen - Under seasoned, which is a shame because I know how to make simmered or sauteed greens extremely flavor packed. There was no reason for this spinach to be so bland, but it works as a palate cleanser. \n\nKey Sir - It's a nice little side. I probably wouldn't order it, but it's a nice way to use beetroot in a savory dish.\n\nAtkilt - This particular dish at this restaurant was quite bland. I know for a fact that you can make excellent, flavorful meals with cabbage and onions and carrot, etc but they dropped the ball on this one too.\n\nBeef Key Wot - Delicious, tender, flavorful. Excellent sauce.\n\nLamb Alicha Wot - Delicious, tender and flavorful as well. Another excellent sauce. I'd happily have either the beef or lamb dish over rice and injera, they're both wonderful. I might say the green sauce for the lamb Alicha Wot was a touch more to my preference, I like vegetal, herby green savory flavors tremendously.\n\nedit: I revise my review of the Atkilt and Gomen. After a 2nd tasting, they do have a light, refreshing flavor. On the first pass, they were overshadowed by the big flavors I mentioned above, but on their own, they're very nice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethiopianfood/comments/11v1nha/i_finally_got_a_sampler_plate_for_a_local/", "created_utc": 1679175447.0, "score": 35, "author": "MuffinPuff", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/ethiopianfood/comments/11v1nha/i_finally_got_a_sampler_plate_for_a_local/", "html_title": ""}

Add the split peas and mix until coated, then add water to\nboil. Cooked on high until a rolling boil, then turn down to medium low to simmer. Simmered for 90ish minutes, it took a long time for the peas to soften. Added salt and topped with niter kibbeh.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe hard part - \"Injera\" and I say that with the loosest definition because it really came out more like if kisra and injera had a baby.\n\n It was stretchy, pliable, holey and soft like injera, but it was thin like kisra and a little toasted. I also had to flip it to cook on both sides instead of using a lid to steam the bread.\n\nI didn't have any teff, so I made a batter with plain wheat flour, bulgur, vital wheat gluten, golden flaxmeal, salt, baking powder, and 2 packets of instant yeast. Made a thin batter and it ended up sitting on the table for about 8 hours. I followed up by adding a bit of self-rising flour to the batter, with a few drops of vinegar to activate the baking powder. \n\nI tried cooking a thin layer in my big pan without oil, and that was a failure; the pan is no longer nonstick, so the batter stuck to the pan and scorched.\n\nI tried a smaller pan, and while the batter didn't stick, it still scorched. I turned the heat down from medium-high to medium.\n\nPoured the batter into the pan, but I did a terrible job spreading so one side was thicker while the other was thin. I tried the lid to get the bread to steam, and it just ended up dropping moisture back into the pan, ruining the bread. \n\nNext round, poured batter into the pan and swirled it around quickly. Things were setting nicely, holes on top, a little browning and edges were curling. I tried to slide the spatula under the bread by wiggling, and the wiggle split the bread. I flipped it anyway just to see if I'm on the right track, and the other side cooked nicely.\n\nIt tasted really good!!! It was nutty from the bulgur and toasty from the browning, and yeasty and just a little sour, the flavor was delightful and savory. The texture is a *little* stretchy and a *little* spongy but very very thin with lots of holes. I'll post a photo or video of it sometime this week. \n\nBoth dishes came out incredibly tasty, I'm really happy with my first attempt.\n\nedit: [Here it is!](https://imgur.com/a/PzyjjQv)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethiopianfood/comments/12x1pab/my_first_attempt_at_homemade_kik_alicha_and/", "created_utc": 1682307413.0, "score": 19, "author": "MuffinPuff", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/ethiopianfood/comments/12x1pab/my_first_attempt_at_homemade_kik_alicha_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I'm trying to become adept at the vegetarian wats and gomen.\n\nMy question is, these wats end up tasting a bit bland compared to what I would normally get at a restaurant. I realize resto food is always going to be more rich, but I'm not sure if maybe there are additional spices/techniques I can use to make the wats have a deeper/more complex/authentic taste.\n\nFollowing Mulunesh Bekay's \"Ethiopian Feast\" cookbook (which I highly recommend!), I typically make lentil wats using the following recipes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Misir Wat recipe:\\*\\*\n\n\\- saute 2 chopped yellow onions and about 2 tsps ginger-garlic paste in niter kibbeh; do this for about 10 mins until it smells good and looks kind of translucent\n\n\\- add 2-3 tbsp berbere powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper and a bit of extra canola oil or niter kibbeh, mix and saute for a few mins\n\n\\- add 1-1.5 cups red lentils and 1.5 cups water, stir and cook on low for about 30-40 mins, stirring occasionally (or put in crockpot on high heat for about 4 hours)\n\n\\- a few minutes before taking off the heat, add about a teaspon of mekelesha kimem finishing spice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Alicha Wat recipe\\*\\*\n\n\\- repeat step 1 above (saute 2 chopped yellow onions and about 2 tsps ginger-garlic paste in niter kibbeh)\n\n\\- add 2-3 tbsps of tumeric, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper and some canola oil, saute a bit more\n\n\\- add 1-1.5 cups yellow lentils or yellow split peas and 1.5 cups water, stir and cook on low for about 30-40 mins, stirring occasionally (or put in crockpot on high heat for about 4 hours)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you all have any tips for stepping up these recipes?

{"title": "Authentic berbere recipies, corroborated!! ", "selftext": "I've been cross-referencing some berbere recipes online and I would like to compile my findings here! perhaps an etheopian can speak to how accurate I am. First, my qualifications: \n\n* I am not Etheopian at all! I'm an Ashkenazi Jew living in the Twin Cities. \n* I speak very little amharic; just enough to ask for some etheopian pantry staples (berbere, niter kibbeh, korarima, etc) \n* I do study lingustics and food science! \n* I am a decent home cook, and I cook etheopian food all the time (usually three times a week!) and have a pretty good relationship with a local etheopian restaurant that sells me spices imported from etheopia. \n* I have not made berbere completely from scratch, but I have compiled a lot of recipes from the internet\n\nSO! What are my findings? \n\n# \"\"Berbere\"\" (the white person version) \n\nFirst I want to start with the worst type of recipe out there: CURRY POWDER PLUS PAPRIKA. These recipes hurt my soul because they do not evoke the aroma of etheopian food! All of these recipies are made by Anglophone white men. Every single one I've found. some of them show their big fancy stack of generic ground indian spices and like three types of artisanal european paprika and some cyanne and then mix them together in a bowl with a whisk and say \"THIS IS BARBERRY, AN EXOTIC SPICE BLEND FROM ETHEOPIA\" and it's like. dude stop. \n\n  \nThose recipes will work in a pinch, but they are really quite disappointing. These are also all the premade blends you will find at grocery stores. If you manage to find berbere somewhere with amharic (Ge'ez script) writing on it, it's probably a better bet. This is the classic \"the more languages the better\" trick for shopping for global foods. \n\n  \nUnless you are buying berbere from etheopians or eritrians who made it themsevles, always check for a list of ingredients. If you don't know what you're looking for, make sure there are at least two words in the ingredients list that sound like magical herbs from a fairytale. if you do know what you're looking for, then you don't need me to give you a list (but I will anyway below in the next few sections). \n\n  \nFrom here on, all of the recipes I have seen (with the exception of one, made by the owner of the etheopian/eritrian food truck in new york) were entirely in amharic, some of which had subtitles in english, but most of which didn't\n\n# Dry Berbere (berbere made from already dried ingredients)\n\nThis method seems to be pretty common among Etheopians. Every recipe was slightly different, but I'll list all of the herbs and spices (and descriptions) of more widespread and then indigenous Etheopian spices. I know a lot about spices and I was able to pick up on some Amharic names for the spices,and research what the spices are based on that. A lot of this knowledge of these spices is based on this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXccgeOLdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXccgeOLdY) I recommend giving it a watch! her berbere recipe is also fantastic, but it doesn't fit in this category. \n\n  \nThis method uses dried whole spices and sundried aromatics. You can dry these yourself in an oven or in the sun, or buy them pre-sundried or pre-dried by some other method. I promise you that every corner you would cut for this recipe has been cut by an etheopian already, so don't feel too bad about using garlic granuals instead of garlic that you dried yourself in the sun. \n\n  \nAdditionally, if you're using this guide to make berbere, I recommend NOT using every single thing on this list! Not a single recipe for berbere had EVERYTHING here, so don't go out of your way to get every single one of these ingredients. \n\n  \nAll the spices are gathered and separated into bowls. First the stems and on average half of the seeds of a FUCK ton of whole dried chili peppers are heated and toasted in a pan until fragrant, and then removed to a woven basket or bowl. Then, each of the spices is toasted until aromatic. use a spoon to move them around and keep them from burning, and add them to the same basket or bowl and the peppers. Everyone who added salt to their berbere toasted that too, but that doesn't do anything (food science!), so I wouldn't bother. \n\n  \nOnce all the spices have cooled, \n\n  \nWIDESPREAD SPICES:\n\n* cumin\n* black cumin (kala jeera; closely related to cumin, in the carrot family) \n* nigella seeds (also called black cumin but completely unrelated)\n* ajwain \n* coriander\n* cinnamon\n* black peppercorns\n* fenugreek\n* dried whole garlic\n* dried whole shallots\n* dried whole ginger \n* dried rosemary \n\nCHILI PEPPERS: \n\n* kashmiri chilis (a type of chili cultivated in south asia, but used in a great deal of berbere recipes) \n* guajillo chilis, or similar cultivar (I have seen california chilis, new mexico chilis, or anything similar used instead of these) \n* piri-piri chilis (this is a cultivar of the tabasco pepper, a different species. As far as I can tell, piri-piri is RARELY used in berbere, mostly reserved for mitmita, a different spice blend; but I could be wrong. I only saw it in one recipe made by a white guy, but everything else in his recipe seemed accurate to me and fits in this cateogry. \n\nETHEOPIAN SPICES: \n\n*  korarima (HIGHLY recommended. ALL RECIPES HAVE IT. also known as \"etheopian cardamom\" or \"false cardamom.\" Sold in whole pods, removed centers of pods, and only the dark colored seeds. similar in aroma to black cardamom, but less smokey. some recipies actually do use black cardamom instead. The only people who used green cardamom for berbere were non-etheopians, but etheopians still use green cardamom in their cooking sometimes.) \n* besobela (HIGHLY recommended. ALL RECIPES HAVE IT. also known as etheopian sacred basil. It's really quite different from basil, and I don't think subbing basil is acceptable.) \n* rue (I really recommend this one! most recipies have it. it is in the same genus as szechuan peppercorns and has a similar aroma as well! That genus is in the same family as the citrus genus, so it's not a surprise that rue is citrusy. It's faintly bitter as well, but not overpoweringly so, and it is really quite tasty)\n* long pepper (I have yet to try this one on its own! It's not as common as the others listed in berbere recipes.) \n* etheopian mustard seed (different from normal mustard seeds! the scientific name for these is Brassica carinata.

People could order one with just one dish in it (like yemisir wat or whatever), or you could get a bunch of different things in it like a communal platter, and then eat your way through the variety. The enjera isn't going to last long in this mode, so you would need to wrap it in foil like a gyro, but that's no biggie.\n\nPlease, someone start an Ethiopian burrito truck in Philadelphia.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethiopianfood/comments/4w6rb2/ethiopian_burrito_food_truck/", "created_utc": 1470344255.0, "score": 1, "author": "None", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/ethiopianfood/comments/4w6rb2/ethiopian_burrito_food_truck/", "html_title": ""}

I try to hit up Ethiopian restaurants as much as possible - the food is always incredible and I crave it (plus, it's vegan friendly which is a huge bonus) but something I continue to run into is simple, pared down menus and waitstaff that don't speak fluent English and so are unable to explain clearly the pricing/ordering system - I've ended up paying $40-50 for a LUNCH which seems a little too astronomical in my book.\n\nMy partner & I don't know how to approach figuring this out - I did some googling but it's mostly HOW to order or WHAT to order at an Ethiopian restaurant, which I'm not having trouble with. I'm mostly seeking to understand if I'm doing something wrong - am I ordering incorrectly? Is it really buffet style and you can ask for \"refills\" of certain dishes that come on the platter with injera?\n\nI ordered a veggie platter with my partner yesterday for $18.99 and she asked if we wanted two and we said yes. I wish I had taken a picture but unfortunately I didn't - I wasn't extremely full after we split our two orders on ONE platter and I guess I'm wondering if it's silly for me to think that paying $40-50 for a meal would leave me feeling very full and satisfied?\n\n  \nEDIT/UPDATE : Thanks for all your responses - I definitely appreciate the well-rounded view on eating Ethiopian food, the customs, and the pricing. I obviously needed to adjust my expectations in regards to pricing and how the food is prepared & how long that process takes.
