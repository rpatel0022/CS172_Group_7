My co-worker took one home and ended up handing it off to a neighbor of his who likes spicy food.\n\nThe neighbor ended up tossing it, whole, into a pot of chili.  While eating the chili, he ended up accidentally eating the pepper whole.  Realizing his mistake, he decided to pop over to the grocery store to buy some soda (Vernors, for those here in the midwest who know what that is) to help with the impending heat and discomfort.  However, before he got to the end of the driveway he started to feel an intense wave of heat with profuse sweating, and felt very, very unwell.  After a few minutes of worsening symptoms he had his wife drive him to the hospital.  They didn't pump his stomach apparently, but his symptoms were severe enough that they kept him overnight for observation and additional tests.\n\nIt turns out he had prostate cancer.  Not sure what stage it was, but it hadn't metastasized.  It's not clear what the interaction was with the capsaicin, but he told my co-worker \"That Carolina Reaper saved my life\"\n\nI", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HotPeppers/comments/ixow42/your_carolina_reaper_saved_my_life/", "created_utc": 1600786349.0, "score": 451, "author": "Twentysix2", "num_comments": 50, "permalink": "/r/HotPeppers/comments/ixow42/your_carolina_reaper_saved_my_life/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I can never eat spice again, goodbye hot peppers", "selftext": "I can never eat spicy food again, goodbye my favourite subreddit\n\nI just recently had a esophagus surgery done due to it being ruptured from throwing up too intensely. \n\nHow it got to that was me and a few buds bought a bunch of hot sauces and peppers for the sake of doing a \u201cspice tolerance challenge.\u201d The winner would be crowned the ruler of spice with a grand total of 100 dollars (20 from each person taking part of the challenge). \n\nWe would first start with mild hot sauces like Saracha up to whole peppers (seed included). After 12 rounds of gruesome pepper and sauce torture, it was just me and my best friend. We had a total of 20 ghost peppers bought, me being the dumbass that I am, I pretty much challenged him saying \u201cbet you I can pop all in one go\u201d and so with a statement like that I couldn\u2019t go back on my word and trusted in my confidence in having years of built up spice tolerance, I thought to myself that I was going to be fine. Man was I so wrong. A handful of ghost peppers thrusted into my mouth and with that I won the challenge by a landslide. I got my 100 bucks and the praise I wanted to hear. Everyone left after that and pretty much the next couple hours were just me and the toilet. I pretty much threw up everything. \n\nThe absolute searing stomach pain was so bad that I couldn\u2019t feel my lower half of my body. I couldn\u2019t take it no more and decided to get myself to the hospital. They ended up finding out that I had a ruptured esophagus from puking so much and had to perform immediate surgery. I went through the surgery and now the doctor is saying that the rupture has damaged my esophagus so badly that it\u2019ll be sensitive to foods not just spice but everything in general. Doc recommended that I never touch spicy food again or else I risk another hospital visit or even death. As well as a diet of liquids and portioned food intake.\n\nSo yeah, this is my goodbye to this subreddit, seeing how I\u2019ll never be able to eat spice again. I really enjoyed my time here, I hope you guys will get something out of this story of mine.

{"title": "RIP...", "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been going through a hell of a year. I\u2019d had my plants for a year and a half (8 plants total) and they helped me psychologically through the lockdown. My wife and I decided to get a divorce and when I left I only had room to take two with me (my ghost and reaper). Taking care of them and checking on them everyday is what got me through that difficult moment. They are what helped me get out of bed and force me to go outside, which led to me running and ultimately pulling me out of depression. I moved into my permanent place with some friends but it didn\u2019t have a porch so I had to place the peppers out by the garage. I was able to get only one small harvest before someone came and stole my plants. I know some people will say to just go buy others, but to me I feel an attachment to them as we\u2019d went through so much and now that they\u2019re gone I feel... empty I guess. Anyways, I didn\u2019t know where to post this but thank you for reading/listening to me. It helped.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the support. Seeing all the support from fellow pepper heads makes me feel less alone and lifts my spirits. I doubt I'll be able to find them if I go looking so I think the only thing left is to let them go.

I watched videos but I'm not sure if the bus I did it to was big enough.

{"title": "Seed Starting Advice Needed", "selftext": "This is my first time trying to grow anything from seed other than using an aerogarden which didn\u2019t teach me anything. I believe I have made several mistakes and need some advice on whether I should abandon my attempt now or hold out some hope. (And I am already starting things late, I am in 6b in Massachusetts)\n\nOn 4/16 I planted seeds in tray one in pre-satured seed starting mixture, I also placed water in the tray below the soil holding inserts. To date I have not seen any sprouts, the peppers in this tray are Jalape\u00f1os, Serranos, Tomatillos, Cayenne, Peach Habanero, and Thai Compact. The tray has a heating pad under it and temp controller set to 77. I originally had the temp probe inserted vertically into a cell of the tray and on 4/29 I changed it to be inserted on an angle so it is near the surface since the top felt cool. I think I probably drowned the seeds in this tray, when I pre-saturated the soil I made sure it was very wet and did not squeeze any water out as I was packing the cells. If I press on the top of the soil now I can see some water around my finger tip. On 4/29 I drained the base tray and I have been leaving the dome off in the evenings to help dry things out a little. Question 1, should I abandon this tray at this point or wait longer?\n\nOn 4/27 I planted my second tray in the same way as the first, so again I think the soil was probably still too wet. On 4/29 I also drained the base of this tray and modified the heat mat temp probe positioning. I have also been leaving the dome off in the evenings and I believe this tray is a little drier but if I press with my finger tip I can still see water. Question 2, should I continue with this tray? If continuing should I continue to leave the dome off to try and get some moisture out of the soil?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice, I definitely should have read more guides and had a better understanding before jumping in.

{"title": "Seedling health check", "selftext": "Hey there!\n\n  \nFirst post here! Gf and I decided that we should try to grow peppers this year.\n\nSo on the third of april we started soaking the seeds in some trays before planting on the 4th. Wanted to post the seedlings here to get some tips and just a general health checkup. My girlfriend knows a little about gardening, I on the other hand know jack shit.\n\nWe decided to follow the noob grow guide except we didn't use foam cups but these clear containers instead. They do have drainage but ofc it's not optimal. We also don't do any bottom watering right now, the tray is just used to keep the fertilizer water out of my radiator which is right underneath those wooden boards (radiator is turned off ofc). Rest is pretty similar to the guide. Soil mix is coco fiber and perlite (although probably not enough perlite but o well, can't change that now). As mentioned before we use some liquid fertilizer that's made for tomatoes and peppers with regular tap water. \n\nThe layout might be a bit confusing but we have 7 varieties with 3 cups each arranged as follows:\n\nFrom top left to top right in columns of 3: Aji Mango, Jalapa, Sugar Rush Stripey, Atalaya Honey, Scotch Bonnet, Carolina Reaper. There are also 3 pots at the bottom in the columns with 4 pots. Those are Shishitos\n\nWe originally planned on only growing 5 varieties in various levels of hotness, but the shop sent over 2  more varieties (the Jalapa and Atalaya Honey) so we said fuck it and planted those aswell.\n\n  \nNow on to the problems: There are always 2-3 seeds per pot and we did have a decent germination rate  thus far (3 weeks now). Reapers aren't doing anything yet but I'm trying to stay patient since they're superhots. Sugar Rush Stripey also take their sweet time for some reason. Scotch Bonnets seem to be doing generally well though.\n\nHowever we had some seedlings die off now; one Scotch Bonnet and one Sugar Rush Stripey decided to vanish within a couple of days or so. Two of the Aji Mango are also looking grim (see image 4). The rest of the seedlings have really curled up leaves. I am guessing that this is due to missing light. The last few days were really dark and rainy and we don't have a grow light. The plan was to move them out at a later point. On the bright side (literally) it's looking a lot sunnier today and hopefully in the following days. And they should be getting a lot of hours in the sun located at the window there. It might also be because of over watering maybe. The drainage really isn't perfect on these and they have been really moist the last couple of weeks.\n\nThere also seems to be some kind of mold or something (slide 6)? There's dust ofc, but then there are a lot of white hairs and some white spots on the perlite. Maybe I should just remove them? Idk.\n\n  \nHope you can give us some feedback on these! Any help and information is greatly appreciated :)\n\nLet me know if you need any more info / pictures and I'll try to update this post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8aa7o", "created_utc": 1745665005.0, "score": 2, "author": "Punchkinz", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/HotPeppers/comments/1k8aa7o/seedling_health_check/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I spent over a $100 on seeds alone. This is not the best sample size admittedly but it's the largest amount of peppers I could grow for this project. 90 plants is already quite a bit but I also have have 9 other varieties of peppers (and other plants) so all my resources are now taken up. \n\nI stretched them thin as I could.\n\n# I grew them to two true leaves and put each seedling through a consistent series of stress tests.\n\nFour varieties consistently proved better then others. I put them through a lot to confirm in case there was some accidental advantage given.  \n  \nTwo plants in particular, both from those top four, proved noticeably better then the rest. I put those two, that I will call the candidates, through even more to confirm they really were tougher.\n\nWhile all of my other varieties (which since there are a lot of make a great comparison) would droop, drop flowers, and show other signs of stress the candidates would consistently take a lot longer to.   \n  \nEven when I gave those other varieties advantages like more water, more shade,  seaweed extract, etc and gave the two candidates disadvantages such as direct sunlight in 30-40*\u00b0* (celsius) weather with no water for multiple days they still showed a far better then average resilience.\n\nThey still showed stress of course but in my years of growing tomatoes, chillies, and egg plants they were incredibly tough. For example the stocky red roaster pepper, one of my most reliable producers, would look like it's on the verge of death while the candidates wouldn't be fazed.\n\nOther Capsicum Chinense varieties, such as the white ghost pepper, couldn't even set fruit despite getting far more water, shade, and attention.\n\n# The two candidates were crossed and I now have the seeds.\n\nI've been a breeder for nine years. A few years all I could do was study and imagine what it would be like if I had the resources to make stuff again but I'm back on my feet.  \n  \nIt's a long, complicated story as to why I can share my past creations and I don't want to mope and groan about the past. I'm excited to start creating again, excited to share progress, contribute to the Open Source Seed Initiative (only when stable), and just being able to hopefully make stuff people enjoy.\n\nI'm actually not a massive fan of chillies over 500k SHU, and after eating a Carolina Reaper I fear them, but I thought this would be a good project for a few reasons. It's a challenge, if it pays off I imagine many would have fun growing the variety, and my heat tolerance have doubled since I last ate a reaper.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gzbhuuaizve1.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b47e3e522eb573e29313aa27489a20fb72f20c3\n\n# There will be challenges\n\nI can grow indoors, even simulate outdoor stresses, but breeding for heat and drought tolerance isn't as straight forward as one might think. For example you can easily end up with a pepper produces later in the season when it's cooler rather then adapting to hot and dry weather basically taking the path of least resistance.\n\nI also cannot tolerate peppers of this heat well. I can test acid content, brix, etc but I can't taste test so I will simply be aiming for the highest brix content. Well I could taste test but the flavour would always be pain.\n\nAlso it takes years to stabilise a variety. Capsicum Chinense is, in my experience, the slowest to grow and is the most fussy about producing flowers, pollen, setting fruit, etc when grown indoors. Still I can grow indoors which means I can reach F8s relatively quick.\n\nI have two other F1 seeds sewn as well but I'll wait till fruit has formed so my future updates aren't a long wall of text. If you made it till the end of it well done! Thanks for sticking around I know this is not the most exciting read. \n\nI'll answer any questions I can!

Two apache chilli plants, one mini meanie and a jalape\u00f1o plant which all seem to be doing okay. \n\nHowever  then bought 9 plug plants and it all seems to have went downhill from there. There were three orange habaneros which came full of aphids and I think the combination of that and potential transplant shock meant they dropped their leaves in 48 hours and never recovered. \n\nHowever I had three prairie fire that initially seemed okay and are now slowly wilting with one already having lost all its leaves. \n\nLastly there were three numex jalape\u00f1os. These were very yellow compare to the others and my own seed started plants and have just gotten progressively more yellow and now are wilting and losing leaves too. \n\nI\u2019m using a SF1000 around 21 inches above on a timer for 16 hours a day.

{"title": "Herbicide Damage to Seedlings", "selftext": "Hi all, just wanted to share my experience and get some advice if I can. This is a photo of a new pepper leaf with some deformations from herbicide since being planted into new soil. This leaf has some of the most minor damage.\n\nI have a variety of hot/sweet peppers going as well as some tomatoes. They were replanted into solo cups with a homemade potting mix, consisting of a decent amount of compost. The compost came from my city compost program, which is similar to those in most cities. \"Green\" waste and food scraps are collected and composted at a local facility, and is available for free. When I checked it out, it looked pretty damn good. Some sticks and rocks here and there, but otherwise a deep, dark compost that smelled like soil. The program is certified by the US Composting Council\u2019s \u201cSeal of Testing Assurance\u201d (whatever that means). They had a lab test sheet posted from earlier that month with a nutrient analysis, and indication that the compost was clean and free of pathogens and herbicides.\n\nThis was not the case. New leaves on the seedlings have zigzagged central veins, and some really deformed, wrinkled margins, both in peppers and tomatoes. Looks like herbicide is still present in the compost and is causing some real problems. I ruled out broad mites, which may also cause this. Looks like they were taking up herbicide to me. All the plants were repotted into new mix with different compost (store-bought \"organic\"). My mistake for trusting community compost here, won't be doing that again. I was just trying to save a buck on my potting mix bill.\n\nMy questions are about what to do now. Will these seedlings be permanently damaged, or will they outgrow their temporary stay in poisoned soil and be otherwise normal as they grow to full size? Should herbicide-damaged leaves be removed?\n\nAny advice on what to do next is appreciated.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/7oqwftm209ve1.png", "created_utc": 1744831567.0, "score": 3, "author": "van_tango_83", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/HotPeppers/comments/1k0t24e/herbicide_damage_to_seedlings/", "html_title": ""}

Both sundews are getting ready to flower which is really interesting. That means seeds and more sundews!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrd0p0", "created_utc": 1743776341.0, "score": 30, "author": "Washedurhairlately", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/HotPeppers/comments/1jrd0p0/natures_sticky_traps/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Seed Starting Advice Needed", "selftext": "This is my first time trying to grow anything from seed other than using an aerogarden which didn\u2019t teach me anything. I believe I have made several mistakes and need some advice on whether I should abandon my attempt now or hold out some hope. (And I am already starting things late, I am in 6b in Massachusetts)\n\nOn 4/16 I planted seeds in tray one in pre-satured seed starting mixture, I also placed water in the tray below the soil holding inserts. To date I have not seen any sprouts, the peppers in this tray are Jalape\u00f1os, Serranos, Tomatillos, Cayenne, Peach Habanero, and Thai Compact. The tray has a heating pad under it and temp controller set to 77. I originally had the temp probe inserted vertically into a cell of the tray and on 4/29 I changed it to be inserted on an angle so it is near the surface since the top felt cool. I think I probably drowned the seeds in this tray, when I pre-saturated the soil I made sure it was very wet and did not squeeze any water out as I was packing the cells. If I press on the top of the soil now I can see some water around my finger tip. On 4/29 I drained the base tray and I have been leaving the dome off in the evenings to help dry things out a little. Question 1, should I abandon this tray at this point or wait longer?\n\nOn 4/27 I planted my second tray in the same way as the first, so again I think the soil was probably still too wet. On 4/29 I also drained the base of this tray and modified the heat mat temp probe positioning. I have also been leaving the dome off in the evenings and I believe this tray is a little drier but if I press with my finger tip I can still see water. Question 2, should I continue with this tray? If continuing should I continue to leave the dome off to try and get some moisture out of the soil?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice, I definitely should have read more guides and had a better understanding before jumping in. I was too confident based on what I had read.

{"title": "Seedling health check", "selftext": "Hey there!\n\n  \nFirst post here! Gf and I decided that we should try to grow peppers this year.\n\nSo on the third of april we started soaking the seeds in some trays before planting on the 4th. Wanted to post the seedlings here to get some tips and just a general health checkup. My girlfriend knows a little about gardening, I on the other hand know jack shit.\n\nWe decided to follow the noob grow guide except we didn't use foam cups but these clear containers instead. They do have drainage but ofc it's not optimal. We also don't do any bottom watering right now, the tray is just used to keep the fertilizer water out of my radiator which is right underneath those wooden boards (radiator is turned off ofc). Rest is pretty similar to the guide. Soil mix is coco fiber and perlite (although probably not enough perlite but o well, can't change that now). As mentioned before we use some liquid fertilizer that's made for tomatoes and peppers with regular tap water. \n\nThe layout might be a bit confusing but we have 7 varieties with 3 cups each arranged as follows:\n\nFrom top left to top right in columns of 3: Aji Mango, Jalapa, Sugar Rush Stripey, Atalaya Honey, Scotch Bonnet, Carolina Reaper. There are also 3 pots at the bottom in the columns with 4 pots. Those are Shishitos\n\nWe originally planned on only growing 5 varieties in various levels of hotness, but the shop sent over 2  more varieties (the Jalapa and Atalaya Honey) so we said fuck it and planted those aswell.\n\n  \nNow on to the problems: There are always 2-3 seeds per pot and we did have a decent germination rate  thus far (3 weeks now). Reapers aren't doing anything yet but I'm trying to stay patient since they're superhots. Sugar Rush Stripey also take their sweet time for some reason. Scotch Bonnets seem to be doing generally well though.\n\nHowever we had some seedlings die off now; one Scotch Bonnet and one Sugar Rush Stripey decided to vanish within a couple of days or so. Two of the Aji Mango are also looking grim (see image 4). The rest of the seedlings have really curled up leaves. I am guessing that this is due to missing light. The last few days were really dark and rainy and we don't have a grow light. The plan was to move them out at a later point. On the bright side (literally) it's looking a lot sunnier today and hopefully in the following days. And they should be getting a lot of hours in the sun located at the window there. It might also be because of over watering maybe. The drainage really isn't perfect on these and they have been really moist the last couple of weeks.\n\nThere also seems to be some kind of mold or something (slide 6)? There's dust ofc, but then there are a lot of white hairs and some white spots on the perlite. Maybe I should just remove them? Idk.\n\n  \nHope you can give us some feedback on these! Any help and information is greatly appreciated :)\n\nLet me know if you need any more info / pictures and I'll try to update this post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8aa7o", "created_utc": 1745665005.0, "score": 2, "author": "Punchkinz", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/HotPeppers/comments/1k8aa7o/seedling_health_check/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I've just started the F1s for my drought and heat tolerant super hots", "selftext": "# I surveyed the internet for the most popular super hots.\n\nFor super hots (500,000 SHU or more) that consistently were labelled the \"best\" or \"favourite\" by those who described their taste.\n\nI would also go on the sites of seed sellers who let me sort by most popular, look at the best selling hot sauces that used hot sauces, and other sources to decide where to go from.\n\nIn the end I had 9 varieties and started 10 plants of each. I spent over a $100 on seeds alone. This is not the best sample size admittedly but it's the largest amount of peppers I could grow for this project. 90 plants is already quite a bit but I also have have 9 other varieties of peppers (and other plants) so all my resources are now taken up. \n\nI stretched them thin as I could.\n\n# I grew them to two true leaves and put each seedling through a consistent series of stress tests.\n\nFour varieties consistently proved better then others. I put them through a lot to confirm in case there was some accidental advantage given.  \n  \nTwo plants in particular, both from those top four, proved noticeably better then the rest. I put those two, that I will call the candidates, through even more to confirm they really were tougher.\n\nWhile all of my other varieties (which since there are a lot of make a great comparison) would droop, drop flowers, and show other signs of stress the candidates would consistently take a lot longer to.   \n  \nEven when I gave those other varieties advantages like more water, more shade,  seaweed extract, etc and gave the two candidates disadvantages such as direct sunlight in 30-40*\u00b0* (celsius) weather with no water for multiple days they still showed a far better then average resilience.\n\nThey still showed stress of course but in my years of growing tomatoes, chillies, and egg plants they were incredibly tough. For example the stocky red roaster pepper, one of my most reliable producers, would look like it's on the verge of death while the candidates wouldn't be fazed.\n\nOther Capsicum Chinense varieties, such as the white ghost pepper, couldn't even set fruit despite getting far more water, shade, and attention.\n\n# The two candidates were crossed and I now have the seeds.\n\nI've been a breeder for nine years. A few years all I could do was study and imagine what it would be like if I had the resources to make stuff again but I'm back on my feet.  \n  \nIt's a long, complicated story as to why I can share my past creations and I don't want to mope and groan about the past. I'm excited to start creating again, excited to share progress, contribute to the Open Source Seed Initiative (only when stable), and just being able to hopefully make stuff people enjoy.\n\nI'm actually not a massive fan of chillies over 500k SHU, and after eating a Carolina Reaper I fear them, but I thought this would be a good project for a few reasons. It's a challenge, if it pays off I imagine many would have fun growing the variety, and my heat tolerance have doubled since I last ate a reaper.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gzbhuuaizve1.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b47e3e522eb573e29313aa27489a20fb72f20c3\n\n# There will be challenges\n\nI can grow indoors, even simulate outdoor stresses, but breeding for heat and drought tolerance isn't as straight forward as one might think. For example you can easily end up with a pepper produces later in the season when it's cooler rather then adapting to hot and dry weather basically taking the path of least resistance.\n\nI also cannot tolerate peppers of this heat well. I can test acid content, brix, etc but I can't taste test so I will simply be aiming for the highest brix content. Well I could taste test but the flavour would always be pain.\n\nAlso it takes years to stabilise a variety. Capsicum Chinense is, in my experience, the slowest to grow and is the most fussy about producing flowers, pollen, setting fruit, etc when grown indoors. Still I can grow indoors which means I can reach F8s relatively quick.\n\nI have two other F1 seeds sewn as well but I'll wait till fruit has formed so my future updates aren't a long wall of text. If you made it till the end of it well done! Thanks for sticking around I know this is not the most exciting read. \n\nI'll answer any questions I can!

{"title": "Herbicide Damage to Seedlings", "selftext": "Hi all, just wanted to share my experience and get some advice if I can. This is a photo of a new pepper leaf with some deformations from herbicide since being planted into new soil. This leaf has some of the most minor damage.\n\nI have a variety of hot/sweet peppers going as well as some tomatoes. They were replanted into solo cups with a homemade potting mix, consisting of a decent amount of compost. The compost came from my city compost program, which is similar to those in most cities. \"Green\" waste and food scraps are collected and composted at a local facility, and is available for free. When I checked it out, it looked pretty damn good. Some sticks and rocks here and there, but otherwise a deep, dark compost that smelled like soil. The program is certified by the US Composting Council\u2019s \u201cSeal of Testing Assurance\u201d (whatever that means). They had a lab test sheet posted from earlier that month with a nutrient analysis, and indication that the compost was clean and free of pathogens and herbicides.\n\nThis was not the case. New leaves on the seedlings have zigzagged central veins, and some really deformed, wrinkled margins, both in peppers and tomatoes. Looks like herbicide is still present in the compost and is causing some real problems. I ruled out broad mites, which may also cause this. Looks like they were taking up herbicide to me. All the plants were repotted into new mix with different compost (store-bought \"organic\"). My mistake for trusting community compost here, won't be doing that again. I was just trying to save a buck on my potting mix bill.\n\nMy questions are about what to do now. Will these seedlings be permanently damaged, or will they outgrow their temporary stay in poisoned soil and be otherwise normal as they grow to full size? Should herbicide-damaged leaves be removed?\n\nAny advice on what to do next is appreciated.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/7oqwftm209ve1.png", "created_utc": 1744831567.0, "score": 5, "author": "van_tango_83", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/HotPeppers/comments/1k0t24e/herbicide_damage_to_seedlings/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Planting peppers from seeds", "selftext": "Hello! I am a very amateur gardener, and I really love to eat peppers. I grew some hot peppers last year that I had bought as small sprouts, and they turned out mostly okay. This year, I have some seeds from peppers I had picked at a farm last year, and I wanted to plant those to see if I could grow my own. I just tried to plant some, and I wanted to know if what I did sounds okay. \nI just took some cardboard starter pots and filled them with some regular potting soil, dropped a sprinkle of seeds in each pot, and then covered the seeds with a little more soil. I then put my 8 little starter pots in a shallow plastic bin to hold them all and watered them to make sure the soil was nice and wet. Then, I covered them with some plastic wrap to keep them moist while they germinate. I put my tray of pots near a south-facing window (I live in Pennsylvania). \nI did all this and then thought, \"I have no idea what I'm doing or if I did any of that right. I should look up videos to see what I should have done\", but when I did that, I got videos that seemed way more involved than I'm up for. As a very casual gardener, is what I did fine, or should I undo what I did and change something? Any advice you have is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!!

(https://www.yara.co.uk/crop-nutrition/sweet-pepper/nutrient-deficiencies-pepper/potassium-deficiency-pepper/)\n\n\nI currently have a mix of scotch bonnets, reapers, ghost peppers, jalape\u00f1o, pepperoncini plants in 3in net pots. All started on 2/21 (~45 days old). \n\nThe ghost and Carolina reapers seem to be behind (which I expected) but notice the ones I started in starter soil (in solo cups) are doing much better. \n\nThey\u2019re in 7in deep containers, using GH flora series with CalMag and some ArmorSi. (Mixed Si, CalMag, micro, grow, bloom) at 1.4 EC 5.9 pH. Also have a 2in airstone in each. \n\nGiving them about 230-300 ppfd (16hrs on, 8 off). Keeping the tent at 50-65% RH, 66-74*F (lower temp range at \u201cnight\u201d)\n\nI only have room for 3-4 plants in my grow tents (plan on keeping them indoors permanently) but I started a bunch to hedge against potential mistakes as I\u2019m a noob.
