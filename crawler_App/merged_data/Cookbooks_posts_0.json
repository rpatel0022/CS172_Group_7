I did a google search and most seemed either to include a lot of really heavy, unsophisticated and unappealing recipes or are overly focused on \"low calorie\" meals (we like to make healthy food but also indulge ourselves a reasonable amount) or specific diets like keto, plant based or gluten free. \n\nWe are omnivores and love introducing our 6-year-old to cuisines from around the world. Just don't love spending hours in the kitchen on weeknights. We have a bunch of books for weeknight cooking already, so I don't need recs for those, but I want to try out meal prepping specifically and it would be helpful to have a guide. I realize this is asking a lot! Any ideas or suggestions? A blog recommendation works too!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/qh1bhw/favorite_meal_prep_cookbooks/", "created_utc": 1635354195.0, "score": 21, "author": "monalisasmileyface", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/qh1bhw/favorite_meal_prep_cookbooks/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Review of \u201cBaking with Dorie\u201d", "selftext": "Review of \u201cBaking with Dorie\u201d by Dorie Greenspan (cross post)\n\nThis book was released last night, so this is a first read not a recipe tested review. [Cover Image](https://images.app.goo.gl/m56Vm86DUebK23tv5)\n\n\n[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/035822358X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_QG9ZP77MZ3X5SEVRBYKT)\n\n**Its rare to find a cookbook written this well**\n\nI knew nothing of Dorie Greenspan prior to reading this book other than she has written a number of well reviewed and highly acclaimed cookbooks. It turns out that \u201cnumber\u201d is now 14 and it represents 30 years of cookbookery, as she calls it. That\u2019s thirty years of experience in teaching us to cook bake and delight in the wonders of food. In reading this book I\u2019m impressed, this book stands out as exceptional in its detail and thorough explanations, it has a fluid style and well done photos..though other books do surpass this one if judging by photos alone in my opinion (for instance I don\u2019t know how to braid and I don\u2019t think from the photos alone I would quite feel comfortable doing it without checking another source). But to be clear this book overall is excellent in terms of photography as well. In the 14 books and 30 years she has mastered her craft but the most extraordinary thing is she maintains a joyful enthusiasm, curiosity and even playfulness that brings life into the creations she shared with us. Her passion for baking is infectious and has me excited to jump into the kitchen and start baking too. I\u2019m going to start with one of the breads and report back in a day or two.\n\nHere is an example of how well written her instructions are. This is her describing how to griddle cook English muffins: \u201c You want it to reach 350 degrees F. Measure the temperature with a thermometer gun or test it by holding your hand about 5 inches above the griddle\u2014if you can keep it there comfortably for 3 to 4 seconds, you should be good.\u201d She comes at it from multiple ways to help you get the best result with detailed knowledge \u201c350F\u201d (rarely do I see an IR thermometer temp for a griddle BRAVO, most say \u201cmedium heat\u201d) but also how you can get a good result out without buying fancy tools. Am I the only one totally floored by how amazing this is? I love this.\n\nThe book is 400 pages divided into seven recipe sections including both sweet and savory fare. The focus is recipes that are simple, rely on basic techniques and have deep flavors and complex textures. They are designed to be flexible so you can modify and play with them. And we are promised that each and every recipe has been thoroughly tested. She provides both weight and volume measurements and has tested the recipes both ways. This is a true rarity where often you find inconsistent or dubious conversions used between weight and volume measures even in high end cookbooks from respected sources. It\u2019s pretty clear Dorie takes recipe testing seriously and goes above and beyond to ensure you get a reliable recipe and a good result. Not only do you get highly detailed instructions (weights and volumes both included with both metric and imperial units) and well described ingredients (eg fine sea salt instead of just \u201csalt\u201d which if lazily described as salt like many authors do would lead up to a 3x difference in saltiness). She offers sage counsel sharing her vast experience with you in every recipe, giving you a heads up about what to expect or what to watch out for. For instance: For a brioche recipe that calls for you to make 2 loaves at once \u201cBecause you get better texture and rise when you\u2019re working with a generous amount of dough, it\u2019s best not to cut the recipe down. Prepare the full recipe\u201d. She Includes guidelines on storage and how long it will last stored in each condition.\n\nList of Recipes:\n\n*Dorie\u2019s favorites\n\u2014 variations of a given recipe\n\n**Breakfast Great Starts

To be fair, this is old school cooking, but the basics are the basics.\n\nSo why do I love this book so much? What caught me and started me on my livelong journey with food was the chapter intros. Here are a few simple sentences that stand out and give you a flavor of how this book can inspire a love affair with food.\n\n- Soups: In the history of eating, soup has been idolized like no other foot. Esau quite willingly sold his birthright for a bowl of lentil soup.\n\nBeefsteak: A steak eater can find no actual words to describe his animal delight. When a man eats fried chicken, he can stop between the second join and the thigh to exclaim, \"Superb!\" ... But a beefsteak eater is a silent man. A steak is no more conductive to conversation than the act of love.\n\nSauces: \"Cooking and roasting are things to teach,\" said Brillat-Savarin; \"it needs a genius to make a sauce.\"\n\nEvery chapter has introductions like this that make you crave to run out and not only prepare every recipe but to read them, relish them, be inspired by them.\n\nOld school, but still my personal favorite (and I have a LOT of loved cookbooks).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/k1qcsx/my_first_cookbook_introduction_to_a_lifelong_love/", "created_utc": 1606435191.0, "score": 13, "author": "DenraelLeandros", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/k1qcsx/my_first_cookbook_introduction_to_a_lifelong_love/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Both have many dishes I recognize, as well as many new ones. They also both provide a few non-injera uses for teff flour, which is helpful (E has teff tagliatelle and teff flatbread, TL has mocha teff brownies and spiced teff snickerdoodles). I think I'm most excited to try several of the fish dishes from E, as I don't have as much experience with that but they sound so good - and am also really intrigued by the smoked milk.\n\nI got my mother **Fire Islands: Recipes from Indonesia** by Eleanor Ford, and that looks really good too.

The next few weeks will set the tone for many months to come. With a deluge of cookbooks released every year, it\u2019s getting much more difficult to gather attention from larger magazines and newspapers, which can make or break a book\u2019s success. How do the big time reviewers select which books to review in their pages? Ironically, it\u2019s you. Readers make all the difference, especially in the early days of a book\u2019s trek out into the real world. The more enthusiasm our readers show Melt: the Art of Macaroni and Cheese during its first few weeks of life, the more attention it will receive from the media \u2014 which is very important for us.\"\n\nAs an aside (seeing as how this is my first post to this subreddit), I've opted to not use my Amazon affiliate link in order to make this a more \"legitimate\" post. I've been watching this book grow, age and mature over the last few years and just received it this morning. I read it cover to cover, completely impressed, and then headed off to their book release party where I was able to sample an assortment of dishes ... a thoroughly deserving book (if you like mac and cheese ... and who doesn't!?!).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/1pazn5/do_you_like_comfort_food_a_friends_cookbook_could/", "created_utc": 1382862866.0, "score": 8, "author": "None", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/1pazn5/do_you_like_comfort_food_a_friends_cookbook_could/", "html_title": ""}

I have a 16-month-old daughter, who's currently in a picky eating stage. My wife and I have found that she eats more when she eats what we're eating (often literally off our plates). She eats on the earlier side, and I tend to work late, so I don't have time to make dinner for the three of us every night. My plan is that every Monday (when I can work from home, and thus have more time) I'm going to start making a big meal for that night plus 2 nights of leftovers.\n\nSo here's my question: can anyone recommend a cookbook of easy, kid-friendly meals that are also consistently 6-8 servings in each recipe? So many of the \"for toddlers\" cookbooks are (understandably) small servings and the cookbooks I've seen with bigger recipes include things like soups, lasagnas, chiles, pot pies, etc., that don't quite work to give my kid small pieces from. (Also, some of the recipes were pretty complex, which I just don't have time for, even on Mondays.) The ideal cookbook would focus on protein-forward recipes -- stews, casseroles, meatballs, pizzas -- that have discrete bits of meat/cheese that would work for the kid.\n\nTLDR: ISO a cookbook with recipes with enough food for three people, including one 1.5-year-old, for three nights' worth of dinners.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/12b8akw/parent_question_for_a_specific_kind_of_cookbook/", "created_utc": 1680580459.0, "score": 7, "author": "SubstantialWerewolf5", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/12b8akw/parent_question_for_a_specific_kind_of_cookbook/", "html_title": ""}

Would love your help in finding a cookbook or two I can consider purchasing for my mom (hopefully before Mother's Day here in the States!). **Do you have any recommendations for baking cookbooks that have been received well by or could accommodate English language learners?** And might have bigger text? \n\nMy mom speaks English moderately well for having had minimal lessons in adult school in the 80's, but is shy and gets frustrated easily about her reading skills. (Part of that is due to her vision deteriorating too, hence the ask for larger font) I hope that by gifting her a baking cookbook that is on the simpler side, text and recipe wise, she can become a little bit more comfortable with reading and enjoy baking at the same time. She's not tech-savvy, but is open to print cookbooks! As someone who has to simplify things and/or look up things online for my mom ALL the time, I'll take what I can get! \n\nSome descriptors that may be helpful - classic baking recipes (simple breads, cookies, cakes), flavors that are typical in American desserts that can be dressed up with fruit or similar. Anything with larger font, or pullout sheets. Tools-wise, she has a general selection of stuff including a hand mixer, but I'm gifting her a stand mixer for Mother's Day this year. :) (She was recently temporarily laid off so I hope baking can help her pass the time.)\n\nI was thinking the Cook's Illustrated recipe book that comes in a binder - I ended up with one from a previous roommate, and am thinking about passing that along to my mom since my husband and I don't use it as much as other books/blogs.

{"title": "Trying to find a vintage cookbook", "selftext": "I have been looking for a specific cookbook for years that has a very specific recipe in it (for sentimental reasons). I seem to remember the cookbook name being either \"Meals/Cooking for Two\" or \"One Pot Meals\". It was a hardbound cookbook, but not a huge tome. Maybe it was a Family Circle cookbook? Not sure. \n\nThe recipe I'm after was called \"Taos Tacos\" (or a very similar name) and used lamb, if that helps any. The rest of the cookbook had recipes organized by meat, and included tongue and liver dishes, so I suspect it was from the 50's or 60's. I remember a lot of the pictures, if not all of them, were black and white. I think there were some drawings of food too. Not like those old Betty Crocker books, where it was pretty and artistic, but more like they wanted you to know what your food should like like but couldn't put in lots of photo pages.\n\nThe specific recipe called for making your own tortillas (but called them pancakes), filling them with some deliciously spiced meat, lining them on a pan which also had sour cream on it, then throwing the pan into the oven for a while. The product was like some sort of enchilada with hints of sweetness. In fact, I think the recipe used brown sugar or something like that in the meat.\n\nRing a bell for anyone?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/3jkjh1/trying_to_find_a_vintage_cookbook/", "created_utc": 1441334356.0, "score": 4, "author": "Madbens", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/3jkjh1/trying_to_find_a_vintage_cookbook/", "html_title": ""}

Not sure.\nThe recipe I'm after was called \"Taos Tacos\" (or a very similar name) and used lamb, if that helps any.

Not like those old Betty Crocker books, where it was pretty and artistic, but more like they wanted you to know what your food should like like but couldn't put in lots of photo pages.\nThe specific recipe called for making your own tortillas (but called them pancakes), filling them with some deliciously spiced meat, lining them on a pan which also had sour cream on it, then throwing the pan into the oven for a while.

My memories of it are mainly of the interior photography, which were pretty distinctive due to a few things:\n\n*If there were any photos of people or their hands (eg., in \"action shots\"), I don't remember them. Possibly a few fingertips showering pinches of salt, etc., but mainly the ingredients and the utensils.\n\n*Lots of dark backgrounds and glass bowls.\n\n*Many recipes had suggested accompanying sauces or toppings, and the relevant picture would attempt to show options as well. For example, a cake recipe giving frosting choices would show several slices next to each other, each with a different frosting.\n\nI really miss this particular family friend, and finding this book would be a great way to remember them. Any help finding it would be much appreciated.

I do find in my experience that the biggest factor are the ingredients anyway, so it's hard to replicate any, but at least to get the skill points.\n\nSince I already do know most of the basic dishes, I'm looking to get an intermediate to advanced level and study and improve on my cooking in my free time.\n\nOr if anyone could tell me how true to source code (ie, authentic Italian) and the level based on previous knowledge these ones are (or if any of them are closer to what I'm describing than not) of the following, I'd really appreciate any input!\n\n\\+ The Silver Spoon: [https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Spoon-New-Kitchen/dp/0714862568/ref=sr\\_1\\_1](https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Spoon-New-Kitchen/dp/0714862568/ref=sr_1_1)\n\n\\+ Hazan: [https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Anniversary/dp/0593534328/](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Anniversary/dp/0593534328/)\n\n\\+ La Cucina: [https://www.amazon.com/Cucina-Regional-Cooking-Italy/dp/0847831477/](https://www.amazon.com/Cucina-Regional-Cooking-Italy/dp/0847831477/)\n\n\\+ Made in Italy: [https://www.amazon.com/Made-Italy-Stories-Giorgio-Locatelli/dp/000854834X/](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Italy-Stories-Giorgio-Locatelli/dp/000854834X/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/1jxxz3h/intermediate_to_advanced_authentic_italian/", "created_utc": 1744512634.0, "score": 4, "author": "CharmingRoots", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/1jxxz3h/intermediate_to_advanced_authentic_italian/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Over the years, I pulled recipes from it without paying much attention to the version/edition and I eventually had several go-to recipes I used from that book.

I'm guessing it was somehow placed in a donate pile and made its way to Goodwill, because that thing was a massive brick and would be hard to miss.\n\nWell, now we're settling into our new home and I'm trying to replace it.  Looking on eBay and Amazon, I never realized there were so many versions, hardcover/spiral, etc. of the Betty Crocker Cookbook.  I don't even know what exactly was on the cover, but I remember it being similar to [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51z1IMVq6uL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg).  It was hard bound, and probably at least 500 pages.  It had color photos throughout, some full page, some smaller.\n\nThe only recipe I can come close to recalling was a simple roasted pecan dessert.

Trying to search with powdered sugar lead me to [this](https://recipesremembered.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/cinnamon-sugared-pecans/) which I thought was it until I hit the ingredient list and saw egg, which I definitely don't remember using.\n\nI know it's not much to go on, but I'd appreciate any help finding my lost version of that big red cookbook.

It so hard to get people excited about a new book which caters to hot, spicy and savory recipes. It frustrating because I think about the 14 months it took me to write, create and self-published a cookbook. It no joke, it's hard work, sweat and passion to do something you love. I thought about the time when I was in my early 20's and I was homeless while attending college. The cold nights I sleep in my car, the early mornings in the park bathroom take baths, food I would get before thrown in the trash to eat, the no's I heard when trying to get help and shelter due to I did not meet the requirements of a battery woman with or without children, that a bed is not available for me. I remember the strength I had and the determination I had to complete college and then earn another degree in Culinary Arts. I'm just venting, it hard out here.

{"title": "Reddit Newbie Here! I am writing a cookbook and need Reddit to help me with a title", "selftext": "Good Afternoon Everyone!  I have been a fan of reddit for a while and lurking quietly in the corner.  I just started work on a cookbook of my Mediterranean recipes from a professional career that spanned 25 years.  It will be a slightly unconventional approach to Southern French, Italian, Moroccan and Spanish food with some Middle Eastern thrown in for good measure.  Here is the premise in a nutshell - Mediterranean cuisine has greatly evolved and developed from its early roots through a series of historical events.  Recipes blew across borders like the infamous winds of the region.   The shared story of conquests, invasions and immigrations.  Each gust brought strange new foods, habits and techniques to the tables of the beleaguered and conquerors alike.  When the dust settled we are left with an artist\u2019s palette of beautiful colors, textures and sensuous flavors.  My cooking style is the reimagined culinary heritage of the Mediterranean.\nThe Greeks gave Provence olives and grapes.  The expansion of olive groves and civilization went hand and hand with the expansion of the Greeks and Phoenicians. It has been said that the Mediterranean ends where olives cease to grow.    \nThe Romans came to help protect the besieged Greeks.  Eventually claiming the region as theirs and forming \u2018Provincia\u2019, the first Roman Provence outside of Italy.  The Romans built some of their greatest cities, N\u00eemes, Arles and Orange.  \nThe Moors, who at their height of power controlled three quarters of the Mediterranean. Only to be rivaled by the Roman Empire which reached slightly further.  The invading Moors brought the habit of serving many small vegetable appetizers as well as a preference of saffron flavored rice to potatoes. They introduced lamb, eggplant and almonds.  \nYes, this is the very general and basics of history but you need to know this to help with my first favor I ask.  I decided to break the book down by the five of the most infamous winds that blow through the region: the Mistral, the Levant, the Bora, the Sirocco and the Tramontane.  My idea is that they represent the crossing of cultural boundaries that the food did and come to represent the freedom of fusion that dominated the region.  Cassoulet was inspired by the Moors; the first pasta recipe was published in Spain; pizzas originated in Greece. I need a title that encapsulates the Mediterranean and the concepts of winds with metaphors of change.  It has to be catchy.  Whomever gives me the title will get a free signed copy of the book and an original Eat Till You Bleed apron.  Please help.  Please help keep me motivated.  Follow the journey of my book from a dream to a realization\u2026  Eat Till You Bleed is my food blog and you can kind of see the direction there...  thanks!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cookbooks/comments/2yhoyp/reddit_newbie_here_i_am_writing_a_cookbook_and/", "created_utc": 1425939370.0, "score": 1, "author": "None", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/cookbooks/comments/2yhoyp/reddit_newbie_here_i_am_writing_a_cookbook_and/", "html_title": ""}
