{"title": "FROM A PROFESSIONAL CHEF TO YOU: The tricks that anyone should know when they buy food.", "selftext": "I wager everyone here knows some of these things, but I\u2019m gonna list everything I can think of in regards to eating healthy and well. I\u2019m gonna make this a list with sections, so hopefully it\u2019s easy enough to parse.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-LEGUMES\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Buy these dried as often as possible. Keep a stock of beans, lentils, and dried chickpeas around if you can. They\u2019re cheap, almost always available, and virtually imperishable. As such, assuming you don\u2019t throw them out and keep them properly stored, buying these is a 100% return on your investment. \n\n-Legumes are one of the most versatile options in your kitchen. As long as you soak them and put them in the fridge before you go to bed they\u2019ll be available the next day to cook quickly. These are the best thing to have if you\u2019re looking to stretch a meal because of their nutrient density and the fact that they\u2019re just damn delicious on their own. \n\n-Look into middle-eastern and African cuisine for creative ways to use these ingredients. Some really common examples are lentil curry, hummus, falafels, and putting chickpeas in a shakshuka. This isn\u2019t a recipe post, so look up how to make them yourself - some grandma has a better (and probably even cheaper) recipe than I do.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-GRAINS AND CEREALS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Like legumes, these are very versatile. However, I find most people know very little about them outside of wheat and maybe oats. I highly recommend learning what the most commonly eaten grans and cereals in your locality are, and then finding the affordable ones. There will be at least one. I guarantee it. \n\n-FLOUR is an essential staple, unless you\u2019re celiac or gluten free - a topic on which I won\u2019t speak because I\u2019m confident anyone who has to deal with those issues knows more than I do. I recommend grabbing all-purpose flour due to its gluten content being a middle ground between low-gluten pastry flour and high-gluten bread flour. You can still use it to make bread, and it has a myriad other uses as a binder or thickener for sauces. \n\n-RICE is amazing, as most know already, but seriously - it\u2019s one of the most important crops in the world. It\u2019s kept civilizations alive on its back for all of recorded history, and it\u2019ll keep you alive, too. There is no better \u201cfill me up\u201d food I can think of.  Wait for those huge sacks of rice to go on sale (it happens pretty frequently), then buy 2. They last forever. Ideally grab long-grain rice if you\u2019re just looking for a side-dish or fried rice base, but in a pinch short grain\u2019ll do; it\u2019s just less forgiving and the starches don\u2019t retrograde as fully so when you cool it it doesn\u2019t keep as nicely. \n\n-KEEP IN MIND that rice is pure carbs. It\u2019s a good base, but you need other stuff to go with it or else you\u2019ll be deficient in nutrients and feel awful all the time. Trust me from experience - college me went through a raw-egg-on-rice phase, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. \n\n-BARLEY, also, is amazing, but for other reasons. It\u2019s high in protein and iron, and can help dramatically improve your nutrient intake for very little cost. In soups, roasted in tea (thanks Korea), and used in tandem with rice, it can go a very, very long way in making your diet a more sustainable one in times of austerity and plenty, alike.\n\n-AVOID \u201cSUPERFOODS\u201d. Not because they\u2019re bad for you - just because of their jacked prices. Not to mention oftentimes the industries surrounding them are ethical nightmares. Don\u2019t get me started on avocado cartels and the impact of quinoa farming on low-income South American communities. In reality, most grains and cereals have a lot of nutrients and minerals, and they\u2019re often overlooked. Learn the nutrition facts, and make decisions accordingly. Google and online databases are your friends, here. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-ONIONS: buy them fresh and store them in dry, enclosed spaces, and buy tomatoes canned and without salt added. Use onions in almost everything, they\u2019re delicious, cheap, and nutritious. \n\n-TOMATOES: Good fresh and better canned. Use fresh tomatoes raw for whatever you want and use canned tomatoes for sauces. Buy canned tomatoes with as little added salt and sugar as possible. \n\n- POTATOES: Treat these as a starch option similar to grains or cereals. Buy them unprocessed, in a sack.  Store them in dry, enclosed spaces. \n\n-BASICALLY EVERY FRUIT: go for it, these things are nutrient bombs and they\u2019re delicious. Buy them seasonally for the best value and if you have a day to do so, preserve them if you ever see a huge sale. I\u2019m still enjoying lacto-fermented blueberries from last year\u2019s insane blueberry harvest where I could buy a pint for a dollar.\n\n-FOR SHOPPING: Generally when you buy produce you should go, in order, to the discount rack, then the sales, and then everything else. Someone out there has a recipe for literally everything, and some of them are even good. A pepper with a blemish or tiny spot of mold is still fine, assuming you cut away the blemish or tiny spot of mold. \n\n-I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH; FIND THE UNDER-APPRECIATED AND OVER-SUPPLIED PRODUCE. There\u2019s always a bin of some forgotten veggie no-one eats for some reason. In the west, at least, it seems to often be rutabagas/turnips. I\u2019ve also seen apples in the fall, corn, and cabbages fall into this category. This is because of a good harvest, or because of a lack of consumer interest - any time this happens, capitalize on it. Everything is delicious if you cook it properly. Buy seasonally, and learn how to use the things you buy. You\u2019ll eat like a king and pay like a pauper.\n\n-CANNED STUFF - I generally have a personal aversion to all canned veggies and fruits except tomatoes, but that\u2019s just my privilege speaking. If you want to buy them or if fresh produce is hard to come by, avoid getting anything with added salt or sugar. Cross-reference the nutrient info on the can with info from a fresh counterpart to avoid buying filler garbage, and try to find somewhere to live with better food accessibility. Alternatively, save up and make a killing by opening a fruit and vegetable market to remove the need to read this very ling post any further. (This is a joke and I recognize the struggle of those in impoverished communities with awful food accessibility.)\n\n-FROZEN STUFF - frozen fruit and veg is great,\nmostly. Maybe dodge the chopped carrots and corn a lot of us ate growing up or find in bad takeout Chinese food, but hey - grab that bag of frozen berries or peas and throw \u2018em in anything that warrants it. Technology for frozen produce has improved dramatically in the last few decades, and we should capitalize on that.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014-PROTEINS\u2014\u2014-\n\n-IF YOU EAT MEAT, buy the least processed cuts you can. Whole chickens, meat on the bone, and ground meats are your best friends. Go to butcher shops, if you can. Freezing meat is fine, but try to avoid buying pre-made frozen protein options. Get raw product and do the work yourself to save a LOT of cash and get better food out of it.\n\n-MEAT IS A LUXURY, NOT AN ESSENTIAL. I say this because in modern western culture eating meat everyday is seen as normal. This is an oddity when we examine all of human history, and this notion should be abandoned if we\u2019re trying to live more affordably. Meat is grossly overrepresented in most diets, and you should always ask if you could cut your portion of meat down in exchange for more vegetables and grains.\n\n-LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN YOUR PROTEINS. A chicken isn\u2019t just 8 portions of meat - it\u2019s also bones and carcass for a stock or soup, fat to be rendered out and used as a cooking oil (thanks, jewish folks!), and skin to be cooked down into delicious little chips. This same list can be used for\npork, beef, and any other mammal you eat. \n\n-FISH IS IFFY. Like, as an industry. Not many people know their fish, and fish processing companies know that and capitalize on it. I always tell people who like fish to buy fresh and whole, and to learn how to pick good fish. Buying cheap processed fish products is akin to asking to be ripped off, to harm the environment, and to accumulate toxins in your body, all at the same time. To not get completely F-ed over by what is maybe the worst food industry in the world you need to know your fish, know the company you\u2019re buying from, and know who\u2019s doing the fishing. Good luck, and please try not to contribute to the death of our water ecosystems. (A good trick is that if you can afford fish when you\u2019re poor and you don\u2019t live beside a large body of water, you almost certainly DON\u2019T WANT IT.)\n\n-IF YOU DO BUY FISH OR SEAFOOD, all the rules for proteins apply. Fish bones and crustacean shells for stock, fat deposits on the occasional salmonid for whatever you want, and fish skin, if it\u2019s your cup of tea, for a lovely snack. Hell, fish organs and salt make up the base for a fermented fish sauce, if you really want to go the extra mile. Rome survived off of fish sauce and bread for longer than our society has been around. The one big difference between fish and meat is that frozen fish tends to suck relative to fresh in a much bigger way - both in terms of quality and retained nutrients. Put frozen fish in soups or curries, to avoid nutrient drain from the water that inevitably will leak out of your fish.\n\nFOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS: You know more about your protein options than I do, and honestly they would require a lot of research I haven\u2019t done to fully discuss. Clearly I have more to learn on the subject, and intend to do so. I only encourage you all to do the same \u270c\ufe0f\n\n\u2014\u2014-EVERYTHING ELSE\u2014\u2014-\n\n-STAY AWAY FROM THE INSTANT RAMEN. I know it\u2019s cheap. I KNOW you like how easy it is. I don\u2019t give one flying fuck. It\u2019s awful for you, it isn\u2019t cheaper than a bowl of rice with soy sauce, a fried egg, and some frozen peas, and it\u2019ll kill you slowly. Just don\u2019t, and ignore anyone\u2019s advice about how it got them through college. Hell, if anyone\u2019s advice involves doing what they did in college, take it with a grain of salt. There\u2019s good advice sometimes, and a LOT of bad.\n\n-AVOID THE JUNK FOOD AISLES. Chips, sugar cereals, premade salad dressings, sweet juice/pop, and processed foods like KD or tv dinners are not the way to go if you\u2019re looking to get the most out of your dollar at the grocery store. They\u2019re bad for you, they\u2019re expensive relative to the cost of production, and they put a burden on your body that you\u2019ll pay for down the line. Exceptions to this are staple sauces like a good soy sauce and fish sauce, grains and legumes, and canned veggies. \n\n-CHEESE IS A LUXURY, SO TREAT IT LIKE ONE. If you\u2019re gonna buy it I recommend buying less of it less often, and buying the good stuff when you do. Kraft block cheese only costs as little as it does because it\u2019s the by-product of the real money-maker: whey protein production. If you\u2019re gonna buy cheese, please support a real cheesemaker. The cheese lover in you will be happier for it. \n\n-ALCOHOL IS ALSO A LUXURY. If you want a drink, I recommend doing it less often and drinking the good stuff. If you like the cheap stuff that\u2019s fine, \u201cgood stuff\u201d is all relative anyway. Just drink less and focus on quality over quantity, whatever your preferences are. \n\n-MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE, AND BUY A THERMOS. I know Starbucks is delicious. Guess what? You can find a recipe for every drink they make online, and then make it better. Some restaurants literally survive because they can sell coffee at a nearly 2000% markup. Truck stop diners and high-end coffee shops do this. I recommend making cold brew the night before, since you literally just have to strain it in the morning rather than brewing a pot.\n\n-FINALLY, LEARN TO COOK. All of this information is fundamentally more useful if you know how to cook. Not knowing how to cook is a luxury afforded to those with the means to afford living in ignorance of this most basic human skill. You are living outside your means if you live in a well-off country, don\u2019t make a least $60k a year, and can\u2019t cook. \n\n\nBest of luck to you all. Stay safe out there.\n\nEDIT: A number of folks pointed out lots of things to me which I wasn\u2019t aware of in regard to beekeeping, so I cut that section out as it was misrepresentative of the industry and failed to highlight key problems in it. Others felt I was being mean to vegans and vegetarians and regardless as to my intentions, I can see evidence that that whole section detracts from this list as a whole and isn\u2019t informative enough to keep. I\u2019ve removed it accordingly. Thanks for the feedback, positive or negative - keep doing good work \u270c\ufe0f\n\nEDIT: Someone made a good point that grocery stores are all laid out different, and not everyone knows the \u201ccentre aisles\u201d mantra. So I changed it to \u201cJunk food aisles\u201d for clarity.\n\nEDIT: I somehow mistakenly said South African communities were effected by Quinoa production when in fact it\u2019s primarily South American.

{"title": "My guide to feeding yourself when your mental health is garbage", "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m no expert at all but I do have mental illness and I go through flares where my mental health blows. I\u2019m also responsible for feeding a family and I have a tight budget for that so I\u2019ve learned some things. Hopefully my trial and error can help another human. \n\n-convenience fruits and veggies are totally worth it. Things like grapes, berries, pears, apples, oranges, mini cucumbers, mini peppers, baby carrots, etc. Things that require almost no prep, you can wash them all at once when you bring them home and then just eat them. I wouldn\u2019t go for pre-cut because it\u2019s a waste of money but I find that having a banana or pear ready to go is really helpful. \n\n-keeping things like hummus, string cheese, peanuts, nuts, and seeds in the house is also convenient for healthy and easy snacking. If you have appetite issues or food aversions with your lows, definitely keeping nuts and peanut butter around are good because they\u2019re nutritious *and* high calorie to help keep you fueled. I find nuts like almonds and walnuts to be cheaper in the baking aisle too fyi. \n\n-canned beans. Nuff said. \n\n-on a good day, cook a whole bag of rice or quinoa (or both). I also prep entire bags of dried beans at once. Freeze in portions (1/2 cup is a serving). On really hard days, you can simply zap it with frozen veggies. \n-which brings me to my next, stock up on frozen veggies. I buy the big bags of steamable ones at sams and keep frozen cauliflower rice/frozen peppers in my house at all times. \n\n-a handful of prepared spice combinations (I like garlic/salt/rosemary, BBQ rub, and good ol\u2019 fashioned seasoned salt) in the cupboard to sprinkle on food is good. Don\u2019t always gotta bust out all the stops, sometimes microwaved beans and rice with BBQ rub on top is more than enough. \n\n-be okay with changing your standards. You\u2019re doing what you can. Sometimes cheese and crackers with baby carrots is a complete meal, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re never too old for a peanut butter sandwich. \n\nIf you have anything to add, please feel free to do so. Good luck!\n\nEdit: words and formatting\n\nEdit 2: I promise I will respond to everyone when I get the chance but HONESTLY THANK YOU ALL. I didn\u2019t expect this response at all! Thank you all for sharing your tips as well as your struggles, I\u2019m so blown away by the amazing hive mind going on here.

{"title": "If you're bored of eating Western style eggs, try cooking it Thai style instead!", "selftext": "As a Thai person, I'm always eager to share the different ways I work with one cheap, universally common staple: eggs! \n\nNow these aren\u2019t really recipes, they\u2019re more like methods that you can try if you like eggs but want some variety without spending extra money. \n\n**Thai omelettes (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27)**\n\nUnlike French omelettes (which are delicately yellow and cooked in butter), Thai style omelettes range from golden yellow to brown in color (not burnt) and is fried in \\*HOT\\* oil like sunflower oil. This gives the omelette a really nice smoky amora, almost like popcorn? You can even pour the beaten egg mixture through a sieve into a pan/wok of hot oil, and it'll be super crispy/wispy like [this](https://www.clipmass.com/upload/news/49/48368_full.jpg). I love it with sriracha (probably one of the only instances where we actually use this ingredient, surprisingly) with a plate of rice. \n\n**Thai steamed eggs (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e15\u0e38\u0e4b\u0e19)**\n\nThis is similar to the Japanese chawanmushi, where an egg mixture (which is super customisable btw - but just adding green onions/scallions is common) is beaten, seasoned with soy sauce, a paste of cilantro root* garlic and black peppercorns (you can blend the 3 or use a mortar and pestle), and finally, pork/chicken stock. Then you steam it in a bowl for 20-30 mins. The result is like a savoury pudding/custard that should be eaten with rice - a very kid-friendly meal and is commonly eaten with you're feeling sick and want something hot and easy to digest. \n\n**Fried eggs (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27)**\n\nLike the omelette, Thai people like fried eggs to be *really* fried in hot frying oil (so olive oil wouldn't work for this). The edges of the whites are crispy (a bit of browning adds a lot of flavor). The yolk isn't  exactly sunny side up, because a key technique is to 'baste' the yolk in the oil until it turns slightly white while maintaining its overall runniness. Fantastic with rice and fish sauce (plus chopped garlic and chilies if you want).\n\n**Grilled eggs (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07)**\n\nThis is probably the least well-known egg cooking method/recipe for both Thais and non-Thais as it's a street food item that you don't really see that much anymore. I recommend this for special occasions as its quite labor intensive. Basically... the contents of the eggs are taken out through a small hole (you can use a pin), thoroughly strained, seasoned with pepper and soy sauce, beaten, poured back into the eggs, steamed, put on skewers and then grilled/toasted. The toast adds a really nice smokiness that makes its way into the egg mixture. The result should be like boiled eggs but with flavour. Side note: I\u2019m not sure how hygienic the eggs are in your country so check food regulations before trying this recipe as every country is different!\n\nEdit: clarity\n\n*cilantro stems work in a pinch \n\nEdit 2: Wow this blew up!
