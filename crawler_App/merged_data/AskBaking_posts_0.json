{"title": "60+ year old \"fudge pie\" recipe doesn't work anymore. Can anyone think of why?", "selftext": "This recipe has been a staple at Thanksgiving for at least 60 years. My mom grew up making it, I grew up making it. My grandma taught us the recipe.\n\nThe recipe is very much a grandma recipe.\n\n>Fudge Pie\n>1/2 stick butter\n>2 eggs\n>1/2 cup evaporated milk\n>1 1/2 cup sugar\n>3 tbsp cocoa\n>vanilla\n>Stir ingredients,  do not beat. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.\n\n\nThe way we used to make it was to stir everything together then cut the butter in to small bits and sprinkle on top. It would bake, and be a delicious pie that was like a custard texture that tasted like a brownie with a crunchy top. The amount of vanilla is one cap full.\n\n\nThen, probably about 15-20 years ago it took the pie 45 minutes to bake right. About 10 years ago we can't get it to set. We used to be able to cut into while still warm, and it was set. If we try that now, it's chocolate soup. Delicious, but completely soup. The top looks like it should, but it's not set. Even if we let it cool, it doesn't set. We can leave it in the oven until the crust is black, and it is still soup.\n\nThe method hasn't changed so that makes me think something about the ingredients has changed. I know eggs have gotten larger. I have tried 1 egg, I have tried medium eggs. It still doesn't work. The closest I can get is with medium eggs, but the pie has to be refrigerated before it will set. Now I can't even find medium eggs in the stores anymore. The pie never needed to be cooled to set until relatively recently. \n\nI have tried cold butter, soft butter, melted butter. It will not set.\n\nWe always use the same brand of cocoa, vanilla, and evaporated milk that my grandma told us to use.\n\n\nWe would make this pie with her so we know she wasn't pulling any shenanigans like giving us a bad recipe. My grandma died around the time the pie completely stopped working, so my mom and I can't ask her what's going on.\n\n\nWe really want our fudge pie back on the table for Thanksgiving. Can anyone figure out why this recipe no longer works when it was such a good recipe before? We don't want another chocolate lava pie. Though at least this failure is delicious, we just want our fudge pie back.\n\nEdit: https://old.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1gqwh7k/fudge_pie_my_grandma_would_always_make_for/\n\nProof there is no flour/starch and grandma wasn't hiding the flour lol\n\n\n\nFINAL EDIT:\n\nI have made 6 pies in the past 24 hours. All but two were soup. The last two... the very last two were a success.\n\n\nAs I was staring into the oven on the last pie I realized what is going on. I saw the bastard that has ruined so many pies.\n\n\nIn my grandma's oven, the rack was in the middle. There were only 3 slots to place the rack in her oven. I have 5. The antique oven in the house I used to live in had 3. The 1970s oven that baked the pie correctly had 3. As I stared with sheer contempt as the massive size of the modern oven compared to the hot box dinosaurs that used to bake this pie perfectly, I realized the smaller ovens, the middle rack setting was closer to the heating element, with an element that wasn't under a sheet of metal, but on display proudly mere inches away from the rack. I cursed my bastard oven and all the other ovens that failed me. How dare they be so large. My grandma's oven could barely fit a turkey on the bottom rack. My grandma's oven was as old as I was when she taught me to make this stupid pie. All the other ovens I used that this recipe worked were older than I was. The ovens my mom used that baked this recipe correctly were older than me, and failed in newer, larger ovens.\n\n\nIt wasn't setting because of mixing method, ingredients, crust, or pie pan. It wasn't close enough to the fucking heating element.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1gqufvm/60_year_old_fudge_pie_recipe_doesnt_work_anymore/", "created_utc": 1731550968.0, "score": 5831, "author": "dairy_cow_now", "num_comments": 468, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1gqufvm/60_year_old_fudge_pie_recipe_doesnt_work_anymore/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

What can I do to prevent this the next time?\n\nThis was the recipe:\nMacaron Batter\n1 cup (125g) powdered sugar\n1/2 cup (50g) powdered almonds\n3 tbsp (25g) unsweetened cocoa powder\n2 large egg whites (66g) , at room temperature\npinch of salt\n5 tbsp (75g) granulated sugar\n\nInstructions\nPrepare the chocolate macaron shells.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00baF (180\u00baC).\nLine two baking sheets with parchment paper and have a pastry bag with a plain tip (about 1/2-inch, 1cm) ready.\nGrind together the powdered sugar with the almond powder and cocoa so there are no lumps; use a blender or food processor.

While whipping, beat in the granulated sugar until very stiff and firm, about 2 minutes.\n\nFold the dry ingredients, in two batches, into the beaten egg whites with a rubber spatula. When the mixture is smooth and there are no streaks of egg white, stop folding and scrape the batter into the pastry bag. The macaronage is ready when the batter falls off the spatula in a thick ribbon and starts to settle into the rest of the batter after about 20 seconds. Be cautious not to overmix, as this can lead to flat macarons. \nPipe the batter on the parchment-lined baking sheets in 1-inch (2.5 cm) circles evenly spaced 1-inch (2.5cm) apart.\nRap the baking sheet a few times firmly on the countertop to flatten the macarons, and remove air bubbles.

{"title": "Please, I beg you, stop using Tasty and SoYummy recipes...", "selftext": "Hey y'all.\n\nI haven't been active on this board for very long, but so far I've really enjoyed everyone and everything on here. As a professional in the culinary industry for over 15 years, and a professional pastry chef for the last 8, I love being able to share what I've learned over the years with those either just breaking into the hobby, home bakers looking to turn it up a notch, or even other professionals looking for new ideas. This sub has been a real pleasure, so thank you. \n\nThat being said, I just want to point out something I've noticed lately. A lot of users who are having issues with recipes are getting them from sources like Tasty, SoYummy, and BuzzFeed. If it seems like these sites are a great place for some recipes, please understand that these are not always reputable sources. For one, they have been known to steal ideas from other internet contributors, and are really designed to make money by getting you to watch their videos. They are not looking out for your best interests, only their own. \n\nIf you are using a recipe that you found in a time lapsed sped up video or from a group that is known for making these videos, please try another recipe first. You are so much better off finding a better cookie or cake or muffin recipe than you are trying to find advice on how to fix a broken one. \n\nEven as a professional, it is really difficult to know what went wrong with a recipe, ESPECIALLY if I can't taste or touch it. It's taken me 10 years of refinement to get a perfect brownie recipe, and I'm STILL working on the chocolate chip cookie. This doesn't just happen over night, and a lot of trial and error is involved, plus a ton of wasted ingredients (unless you're lucky enough like I am to have an SO who will eat anything) If you don't want to have to go through all this time and effort and flour, you're better off finding a food blog you really like rather than these baking videos. \n\nNow, I'm not trying to shame anyone. If you use these sources and they've worked for you, that's fantastic! Keep baking! But if you've used them and something seems off, please consider that it's not you, it's the recipe. \n\nThat's it from me. Happy trails, and keep baking!\n\nEdit: I just want to make something clear. If you successfully use these sources for baking, that's awesome! But I don't need to know about it. Please don't share your success stories in an attempt to prove me wrong. This isn't a wrong or right thing, and I'm not trying to make any arguments.  \n\nI just want newer bakers to understand that if you use them and they DON'T work, it is more likely the recipe than anything you did.\n\nEDIT 2: WOA! I've never gotten a Reddit award before! Not sure what it means, but COOL! Thanks kind stranger! I'm just trying to do my part in helping bakers everywhere. :) <3\n\nEDIT 3: WOA!! A platinum award. Wow. Thanks kind Reddit stranger! I will used this to pass love and cheer to other baking subs! <3<3\nAlso, lots of people asking me for my brownie recipe. I'm okay with giving it away.. maybe we could ask the mods for a special dispensation to post it? That'd be cool.\n\nEDIT 4: I'm starting to think Tasty is trouble shooting their recipes by posting them here.

{"title": "So I tried Tasty's Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies...", "selftext": "So I made a post not to long ago that has been the topic of discussion lately. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/iqpk7m/please\\_i\\_beg\\_you\\_stop\\_using\\_tasty\\_and\\_soyummy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/iqpk7m/please_i_beg_you_stop_using_tasty_and_soyummy/)\n\nIn said post, I asked the newer or novice bakers who come here for advice to stop using recipes from Tasty and Buzzfeed and other aggregate recipe websites because they're not reliable and can either give a baker false ideas about proper technique or kill their spirit for baking completely. \n\nWhat spurred me to write the post was seeing the same two recipes from Tasty coming up over and over again (one brownies, one cookies), with questions about how to make the recipe less sweet, why the texture wasn't what was expected, or how to fix the recipe overall. In my frustration, I wrote the post I linked to above. \n\nTo be fair, I hadn't ever really TRIED any recipes from Tasty, I just assumed they wouldn't work often by looking at them and seeing disparities in ratios or technique. So, in the interest of science, I decided to put my money where my mouth is and actually try one of them. \n\nI chose the famous chewy cookie recipe: [https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies](https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies)\n\nI want to make a couple things clear first. I am a professional baker and have been baking as a hobby for about 20 years, professionally for about 8. I have an associates degree in Baking and Pastry Arts, and have worked for country clubs, hospitals, caterers, and even at Disneyland for a number of years. I also would like to mention that I followed the recipe NEAR EXACTLY. I followed every direction to a T, and even let the cookies rest in the fridge over night for \"maximum flavor\". I changed ONE thing, and that was reducing the amount of chocolate. (I even broke up an expensive chocolate bar instead of using chocolate chips because the recipe insisted that chunks were better.) I reduced the chocolate because it was WAY too much. I mean aggressively too much. Like, we're talking more chocolate than cookie at that point. So I used 4 ounces instead of 8. \n\nI also made two batches. One exactly as written and one with my own edits. \n\nResults?\n\nThey both sucked. \n\n [https://imgur.com/usu2tGW](https://imgur.com/usu2tGW)\n\nFrankly, the recipe uses WAY too much sugar to flour. For comparison, Sally's Baking Addiction (who I know everyone here loves) [https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/) Uses the same amount of sugar as the Tasty recipe, and nearly TWICE the amount of flour. The resulting cookies from Tasty spread too far when baking and end up flat (because the recipe uses baking soda without an activating acid rather than the more appropriate baking powder with the activation agent already mixed in) and then tells you to refrigerate overnight rendering the baking soda near useless. They're also aggressively sweet, and chewy in a bad way. Like making my jaw hurt. \n\nSo overall, I'm gonna stick with what I've stated before. The recipes may be tested, but it seems more like they're tested once to make sure they are at least edible, and then rushed to print. \n\nNow I want to point out, this is how they acted in my oven, with my fridge, and my humidity levels. But that's just my point. Scientific generalization states that for something to be true it needs to be reproduce able. And these just aren't.\n\nAlso, for anyone who is interested, here are the changes I made for MY cookies. They still sucked. But I know what else I would change. Overall, I think this recipe would need about 5 R&D sessions to come out right. \n\nFirstly: I browned the butter. This was to give the \"butterscotch flavor\" that Tasty talked about without having to put them in the fridge overnight.. because I want cookies now, dammit) Because I was reducing the amount of liquid by evaporating some of the butter, I reduced the flour down to 1 cup. To fix the sugar to flour ratio at that point I also reduced the white sugar down to half a cup. I used baking powder instead of soda (the first clue that Tasty's recipe is jacked up) and I replaced the vanilla with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Because I like cinnamon. Last thing I did was I stuck with the 4 oz of broken up semi sweet chocolate bar, but I shaved some of my own cream chocolate that I make myself into it as well, for a marble effect.

{"title": "American Cheese Frosting", "selftext": "**Update:** Success (also sorry, I missed the 'no updates' rule clearly)\n\n  \nHello, me again!\n\nI have tested the ermine frosting method of incorporating Kraft singles with a small batch and I'm happy to report that thanks to the various advice and encouragement I was given, [it was a first-attempt success](https://i.imgur.com/JsI3XVP.jpeg) (seen here lazily piped on top of a mini trial cupcake that is butter pecan and maple). It is not as light and fluffy as I might otherwise like (this will warrant a little adjustment in the final product later, possibly extra whipping time), but it holds up to piping and has a pleasant taste of very buttery mac and cheese sauce so I'd call it a success!\n\n**Some observations:**\n\n* The ~~cheese pudding~~ (I hate this) roux thickened extremely fast even on the lowest burner, almost certainly due to the emulsifiers and whatnot in the singles\n* The roux also cooled abnormally fast. Freakishly fast. It was cool enough within minutes of taking it off the burner and was already congealing before I could finish pushing it through a fine mesh sieve. I'm not sure what food science sorcery is responsible for this, but it did make the process quicker, which was nice\n* Extra salt was needed to keep the American cheese flavor strong after roux-ifying it.\n* To compensate for the extra-gelatinous nature, I beat the cooled goo first to loosen it up before incorporating it into the butter\n\n**The spouse review:**\n\n\"You're not going to elevate Kraft cheese, but it's good.\"\n\n**The recipe\\*:** If you would also like to attempt this and don't want to commit to a full batch of cheese-flavored \"icing\" (I can't blame you), this will make a pretty modest amount, just enough to horrify and delight unsuspecting friends and family with a couple of cupcakes:\n\n* \\~75g processed cheese (I'm a Kraft purist, but you do you)\n* 15g flour (possibly not even necessary)\n* 113g whole milk\n* 4 tbsp unsalted butter - room temp\n* Salt to taste\n\n1. Heat cheese and milk together on low-medium heat, stirring often, until homogenous\n2. Add sifted flour and continue to stir; heat mixture over low-medium to a simmer until thickened to pudding-like consistency\n3. Remove thickened mixture from heat and optionally pass through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps or scorched bits\n4. Allow mixture to come to room temp then beat on medium-high, adding softened butter 1 tbsp at a time\n5. Salt as needed\n\nYou may want to experiment with ratios to get your preferred flavor and consistency - the final product in my case will also have sausage crumbles, maple shards, and a maple icing, so it will need to compliment the other components accordingly.\n\n\\* *Please note that I am not a professional, I bake purely for fun, and I've only ever modified recipes and have never written/properly tested them from zero, so YMMV and you can probably find ways to do this even better -- and you should.*\n\n\\----\n\nYou read the title correctly. I'm on a mission to defy the natural order in pursuit of Kraft singles in a pipeable icing form, and before I spend a lot of money on butter in this economy, I'd love to know if anyone has any friendly advice on how I might best achieve this.\n\n**Qualities I'm looking for:**\n\n* Pipeable - It doesn't need to hold up to anything like flower piping, but it should have body recognizable as frosting\n* Not sweet - This is deranged, but it's not *that* deranged\n* Definitely tastes like Kraft cheese (Velveeta is not welcome here)\n* Is not being propped up by goat's cheese\n\nEssentially what I'm looking to accomplish is to make homemade ~~Cheez-Whiz~~ Easy Cheese...for a cake.\n\n**Running theories:**\n\n* Treat it like an ermine frosting; make a sort of fondue and whip at room temp with butter\n\nAt last resort, I'll abandon this idea and just make some sort of sauce for the inside of this unholy creation, but you have to understand that I've been theorycrafting this for so long that it's really a matter of principle and personal pride that I see this thing through to the end. Thanks in advance!\n\nETA: Thanks so much for the bevy of great ideas/support! I feel like I've got some really solid leads here to get me down the road on this Halloween-worthy concept. For the record, I'm attempting a McGriddle-like flavor profile. The current plan is pound cake with maple shards, processed cheese icing, either bacon or sausage crumbles, and maple icing finish (with cheese accents, naturally).

{"title": "America's Test Kitchen measurements WRONG?!?!?!", "selftext": "TL/DR: Pretty sure ATK's flour measurements are FUBAR\n\nHubs got the Complete ATK cookbook for Christmas and we've been exploring the recipes.  I've been on a baking kick lately and was looking forward to improving some skills using recipes in the book that I hadn't made before. \n\nI've made bread successfully before. I enjoy baking, especially breads, but the two recipes I've tried out of this darn cookbook have spectacularly failed. \n\nToday's failure was their Fluffy Dinner Rolls. The book said it was a tacky dough and not to dust the counter with flour, so I figured they had their amounts pretty spot on. It uses the tangzhong method and since I had not used it before, I figured the failure was mine and remade the dough when it was just unworkable after the first rise.\n\nThrew out the first attempt, watched some YouTube videos so I could see what the dough should look like at the various stages and started again. I weighed my ingredients out and went to work. The dough never developed past \"soupy-gloopy\" stage, even after an hour of kneading (at probably a higher speed than the mixer would have liked). \n\nAt this point I looked at the recipe in the cookbook and compared some of the amounts to other similar ones online and noticed that the one in the cookbook was calling for too much liquid given the amount of flour and started adding more until the dough finally came together. \n\nThe fluffy rolls ended up being really good, but the continued failure while following the recipie down to the gram was really bothering me and I kept going over the steps in my head.\n\nStep one: Convert volume measurements given to grams\n\nStep two: Follow recipe as written\n\nI went and got the cookbook to look at the volume measurements again as the first line of the introduction to the recipe is, \"We strongly recommend weighting the flour for the dough.\"\n\nATK's Fluffy Dinner Rolls calls for 2 cups of bread flour. King Arthur bread flour weighs 120g per cup. Gold Medal (the flour ATK says they use unless otherwise specified) weighs 120g per cup. While I was double checking KA's weight online, I noticed that they have the weight in ounces for a cup of their bread flour at 4.25oz.\n\nATK's recipe reads, \"2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour.\"\n\nI FOUND THE (beginning of) THE PROBLEM.\n\n2 cups of bread flour should weigh in at 8.5oz or 240g.\n\nWent to ATK's Conversions section where they have flour weighing 5oz or 142g per cup.\n\nEven using their own conversion table their given measurement is wrong. \n\nThis error is pretty consistent throughout the bread section. Any baker whose first step is to convert the volume measurements to grams using internationally recognized standards is set up for failure. \n\nAnd  yet, in the back of my head I still think that maybe I'm the problem. After all, everything in this book was supposedly thoroughly tested.

We are a home based vendor so it has to be under certain food laws (basically not having to be refrigerated is the simplest understanding of it). Right now the idea is to make different pie crusts with the leftover cookies and butter. Then selling either the crusts or maybe some cookie/brownies baked on top.

What can I do to make it a bit fluffier and less dry? \n-I waited for the cakes to cool down but when I cut them, the cakes still crumbled and fell apart in some places (the 8 was probably the one with the worst damage).

For the \"coffee sponge,\" I prepared an almond jaconde that I soaked in espresso.\n\nAll week, my family kept saying, \"Sounds nice; hope the corn works. It might be weird in flavor,\" etc. I understood their hesitation about tasting corn in a tart, but today, when we tasted it, it was truly delicious! The pastry cream is excellent, the corn flavor is noticeable and tasty, and everything came together beautifully in the mouth.\n\nComment:\nI would have liked a stronger coffee flavor; it was noticeable but gentle.

{"title": "Why does this cookie recipe want melted butter?", "selftext": "This is the chocolate chip cookie recipe that I've used for years and I've always loved the way the cookies turn out, but I've recently gotten interested in knowing how recipes work, and I'm really confused as to why a cookie recipe would have melted butter. I'm especially confused as to why a recipe with melted butter says to cream the butter and sugar, as I thought that was something that one did with softened butter.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 2 cups flour\n* \u00bd teaspoon baking soda\n* \u00bd teaspoon salt\n* \u00be cup butter, melted\n* 1 cup brown sugar, packed\n* \u00bd cup white sugar\n* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n* 1 egg\n* 1 egg yolk\n* 2 cups chocolate chips\n\n## Directions\n\n* Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F\n* Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside\n* Cream together the melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar\u00a0\n* Beat in vanilla, egg, and egg yolk\u00a0\n* Mix in sifted ingredients until just blended\n* Stir in chocolate chips using a wooden spoon\n* Put cookies on cookie tray\u00a0\n* Bake 15-17 minutes, until edges lightly toasted\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(This is completely unrelated to the butter question, but I was also wondering what people here thought about sticking some of this dough in a waffle maker. Is that a terrible idea or could it work? I live alone in a dorm so I don't want to make a million cookies at once. I'd rather leave the dough in my fridge and bake one at a time but I only have a microwave and a mini waffle maker unless I go all the way to the communal kitchen and preheat a whole oven which seems like overkill for a single cookie. Thanks!)\n\nUpdate: Waffle cookie was a success! The only change to the recipe I made was to use 5 tablespoons of pasteurized liquid whole egg instead of an egg + an egg yolk. I chilled for about an hour before waffling. As for the waffling, we (my roommate and I) made four attempts before we couldn\u2019t eat any more cookie. I\u2019ve posted the pictures to my profile because I can\u2019t post them here. Attempt number 4 was **by far** the best. For that one, we took about 1.5-2 tablespoons of dough and flattened it a lot (we found that when it wasn\u2019t flattened, the outside cooked really quickly and the inside was still raw . See attempt 2 - delicious, but not sure it\u2019s considered a cookie). We then cooked it for about 1-1.5 minutes in [this](https://www.target.com/p/dash-mini-waffle-maker-red/-/A-52759030?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000014773183&CPNG=PLA_Appliances%2BShopping_Brand&adgroup=SC_Appliances&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=c&location=9011070&targetid=pla-323070239024&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1247068&ds_rl=1248099&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyJOBBhDCARIsAJG2h5eZ83g6Hf8GP5soPyNw6_vrX_q2DOXghAZ3wLma1pFkkxNGZB87owcaAo1CEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) mini waffle maker from Target.

She speaks like all Britons do about tea related things, with authority. She must know things. I follow the recipe, and I use chilled butter. I recall I cut the butter rather small because I really wanted to make sure I did a good job. I use a pastry cutter and not my hands. I even chilled the dough after I cut it to make sure it was solid. ...Aaannnd they didn't rise.\n\nSo, my darling husband (who falls on a bag of almonds and french macarons fall out) decides to give it a go himself. And he tries [Paul Hollywood's recipe.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/paul_hollywoods_scones_70005) They're magnificent, they rose 3x their size, they are gorgeously brown, when they're pulled apart angels sing. I'm jealous. He says, \"you just have to follow the recipe.\" Just casual like that. Thing is, I watched him make make them. I was there.\n\nSo I make the exact. same. recipe. Same way, same process. I use frozen butter grated into the flour because that's what husbando used. I weigh out all the ingredients. I chilled the dough because I vaguely recalled that I want a pastry like texture so cold butter is best butter. I didn't twist the pastry cutter. I cut the 2nd batch of scones into wedges to avoid overworking it. I applied egg wash over the tops of the scones. But some must have dripped down the sides, or maybe I didn't give an offering to the patron saint of baking powder, because.... they didn't rise. They taste like hockey pucks of sadness. I go cry in the corner and don't try scones again.\n\nFast forward to self-isolation. I figure, I've got nothing else to do, why not give scones another go. I go to [King Arthur Flour's scone recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/scones-biscuits-recipe). They're drop scones, so I can rule out any overworking of the dough. I preform the recipe exactly as written. I weigh out all ingredients. I grate frozen butter into the mixture. (I substitute almond extract for the vanilla called for. I reduce the amount of cranberries and chocolate called for by half.) I grease a cast iron wedge pan with sprayed coconut oil and drop the batter into the pan cold. I apply sliced almonds as the garnish topping and I pray to the oven gods for the scones to rise. Well, they rose. ....And, per the husband, \"you made a tasty almond cake.\" I mean, it is tasty. But it is certainly not pull apart flakey. More like pull apart moist and cake-like.\n\nI just, what am I doing wrong? Am I cutting the butter too small? Is it the grater?

{"title": "Other than the obvious fact that one is lemon and the other is lime, what makes lemon meringue filling and key lime pie filling taste different?", "selftext": "There was a period when I was growing up, when my mom decided she really liked key lime pie, so she would frequently buy them from Costco. Since I was the one with the sweet tooth and healthy appetite, I was the one expected to finish whatever she didn't eat. By the end of that period, I decided I didn't really like key lime pie. There's something about it, some kind of sourness that seems like it's more than just the citrus flavor; there's almost like a kind of yogurt quality to it (I mean like plain unflavored yogurt). \n\nConversely, I'm still a huge fan of lemon meringue pie. And I mean like the basic Mrs. Smith style, not the fancy stuff that maybe tastes a little more like cheesecake. The lemon part of a lemon meringue pie is almost just lemon pudding or something, it doesn't have that kinda yogurt or whatever element to it. \n\nOkay so, here's the actual baking question. A few days ago, I made [this](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-bars-recipe/) recipe for lemon bars. I think it tastes pretty good overall, but it does have a little bit of that excessive yogurty sourness that I don't really care for. Can anyone offer any theories about what would make it taste like the element of key lime pie that I don't like, instead of just a smooth, sweet lemon flavor?\n\nI should note that I had a bit of a problem with the eggs not quite combining properly. When I first opened the oven to check it, there were a bunch of white splotches like the eggs had just kinda cooked on their own. I broke them up and stirred them back in together with the rest of the filling. I figured the end result was gonna be a lumpy mess, but the texture ended up being pretty smooth. So I don't know if the eggs have anything to do with how it ended up tasting, I just wanted to give all the potentially relevant details. \n\nAlso, this is the first recipe for lemon bars I've tried making myself. I feel like when I've had lemon bars that other people made in the past, the vibe was more lemon meringue than key lime, but maybe I'm just misremembering? Or maybe I should try a different recipe? I don't know, this is hard because I don't know if that element which I find unpleasant in key lime pies (which isn't in lemon meringue) is something anyone else experiences or cares about, and I certainly don't know what to call it. I just feel like the lemon bars I made are really close to having a taste like what I want them to be, but they're just not quite there (and I'm the only one eating the desserts I make, so I don't want to go through like five pans of lemon bars figuring it out by trial and error).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/n5hdva/other_than_the_obvious_fact_that_one_is_lemon_and/", "created_utc": 1620225376.0, "score": 128, "author": "rb4ld", "num_comments": 45, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/n5hdva/other_than_the_obvious_fact_that_one_is_lemon_and/", "html_title": ""}

Husband says pie crust is slightly chewy, it is flaky by a little chewy - this is an improvement from last time because I worked the dough last time and it became very hard, this time I was careful of not working the dough. I used 2.5 cups flour, 1tsp salt, 1tsp sugar, 1 cup butter - I incorporated the butter in dry flour manually using a pastry cutter and it required work as the butter was very cold and hard and I don't have a good processor, then I added ice water 1tbsp at a time (total half a cup + 2tbsp white vinegar) and just slightly mixed and then brought it together, let it rest in fridge for an hour. I took it out, let it rest 5 mins and then rolled it into a crust.\n\nI need to know what I could have improved or any hacks so that the crust is only flaky, with no chewiness?\n\n2. Hollowness under the crust -I used granny Smith apples and just combined apples, sugar, 2tbsp flour, lemon juice and spices in a bowl, let it rest for 15-20 min, scooped only the apples in the pie, not the juice. 7 big granny smith apples in 9inches pie.\nI made sure there was a mound, I made sure to press them down and then covered it. It resulted in a giant hollow under the crust after Baking. I don't want to precook the apples(#3) so how can I ensure that I don't have this hollow space under the top crust ? I made vents as well\n\n3. I baked 350F for 65 min, I was supposed to do 50 min but the pie was very white and I wanted it to be golden. I think the apples are overcooked and mushy which is not pleasant. From what my husband says - the apples should still have a structure. Please help me understand how to fix it?\n\n\nOverall I am really desperate to get some advice on improving this and make a good pie.

{"title": "Why isn't my dough as stretchy when I knead it by hand vs in my bread machine?", "selftext": "I've wondered this for a long time. I use bread flour which has made a HUGE difference in how stretchy the dough is vs using AP in the bread machine.

It can stretched pretty thin too (not translucent, but you can pinch and pull pretty far) without tearing. When I do it by hand, I find the dough to always be much firmer and less stretchy. Consistently I can't really stretch it thin, I can pinch it but can't pull very far before it tears (it has the same consistency as when i was using AP too which seems odd). I'm fairly certain I've kneaded it enough because the crumb structure is about as dense (if not a tad denser) than when I've used the machine.

{"title": "Chocolate Chip Cookie problems!", "selftext": "Chocolate Chip Cookie Help!\n\nHi! Apologies in advance for my terrible ability to explain things. \n\nEver since quarantine started, it\u2019s been a tradition for my sister and I to bake chocolate chip cookies. Every time we bake them, though, they always turn out different each time (even though we use the same recipe)\u2014 and they\u2019ve never been perfect. \ud83d\ude05\n\nWe\u2019re using the [Original NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe](https://www.verybestbaking.com/toll-house/recipes/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/) (aka the one on the back of the chocolate chip bag). We bake them at 375F for 7-9 minutes, without any sort of parchment paper under the cookies. We also changed the flour from 2 1/4 cups to 2 cups (did this because we noticed after many batches that the cookies were WAY to flour-tasting). We haven\u2019t had any problems related to the flour after reducing it, but we have had other issues. \n\nWe\u2019ve identified 2 reoccurring problems:\n\n-The dough turns out too liquid-y, and the cookies bake more like a sponge cake. \n\n-The cookies are undercooked, almost raw, in the middle, but are crispy/burnt on the bottoms and edges. \n\nThe past few times we\u2019ve made them, however, the undercooked center/crispy bottoms problem has persisted. \n \nFor our most recent batch, we decided to experiment with chilling the dough and not melting the butter as much (to avoid the liquid batter problem), and we had a much firmer dough. We left the dough to chill overnight in the fridge, but I think that was too long. \n\nWhen we baked them the next day, the edges browned quickly, but the middles were almost completely raw. We could tell something was wrong the moment we took them out due to the overall dark color of the cookies. Every batch we\u2019ve made previously has never been this dark, but we thought it was just because we chilled the dough. \n\nWe took the cookies out of the oven because we didn\u2019t want the bottoms to burn even more, but the middles were a gooey, undercooked mess. They were SO undercooked, in fact, that when we tried transferring them from the pan to our wire cookie rack, the centers caved in, making some of cookies look like \u201cO\u201ds \ud83d\ude02. We put the remaining decent cookies back in the oven for another minute or two, and that helped a little, but it didn\u2019t really do too much. \n\nAfter letting the cookies set, they firmed up a bit, but there was a clear difference between the edges and center. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re doing wrong\u2014 we just wanna perfect our cookie recipe!

{"title": "Brittle Butter", "selftext": "Ive been using the same technique for many years for preparing butter for laminated products. Whether I am making croissant, Danish, or  puff, I use cold butter right from the walk in and beat it  with a rolling pin until it is pliable.

{"title": "Help with substitutions", "selftext": "I don't really know how Reddit works, and if this is \"allowed\", but I posted this on r/Baking and I'm copy-pasting my post directly here:\n\nI'm a somewhat beginner baker\u2014I'm pretty good at baking with recipes and even improvising a bit, but I don't really understand the\u00a0*why*\u00a0behind a lot of it\u2014and so I have a lot of questions about substitutions, and searching online confuses me more because I end up getting seven different answers, so I thought I'd compile my questions, and that way I could get specific answers.\n\n1. I don't have (or want to buy, because nobody in my house is going to use it) espresso powder, but I really want to make coffee-flavoured things, or add a coffee note to chocolate cakes, brownies etc. I have dark roasted ground coffee with chicory. I don't think I can just directly replace the espresso powder with ground coffee since it doesn't dissolve. In cake recipes where there's water or milk, I've tried to replace varying amounts of the liquid with brewed coffee or coffee with milk, but I can never taste it when it's done, even when I can definitely smell it in the batter.\n\na) Can I just replace espresso powder with coffee powder?\n\ni) If so, then in what ratio?\n\nii) If not, then what else can I do?\n\nb) What about when there's liquid\u2014how much of it should I replace, and how strong should the coffee be?\n\n2) I really like the taste of brown sugar, but substituting it 1:1 (which is the advice I generally saw online) changes the texture of the cake. I really like the texture of \"Depression Cake\", and I've made it vanilla-flavoured before by just substituting the cocoa powder for more flour, but when I replaced even just half of the sugar with brown sugar (dark brown, it's the only variety I have), it became really dense and not spongy at all. For cookies and cakes using the creaming method it worked perfectly, but not for this. How can I do it for cakes like this?\n\n3) Butter: how can I replace it with oil in cake recipes, because generally I've found that ones with oil are much more moist, which is definitely how I like my cakes. For recipes using melted butter I've just directly replaced it with oil 1:1, but I'm not sure about how to do it for creaming/reverse creaming method recipes. If I can't replace it, any tips on how to make them more moist?\n\n4) Butter again: I generally use salted butter and just don't add additional salt and it's perfectly fine, but when it involves brown butter, it becomes wayyy too salty. I bought unsalted butter, but when I melted it, it smelt so bad. The only way I can describe it is the smell of when you're cooking ghee at home (iykyk). Any replacements? Or any tips on how to make it not smell?\n\n5) Cinnamon: this one isn't about substitution, but more of how much to use. I don't have cinnamon powder, I grate cinnamon sticks instead. I've followed the amount specified in recipes, and sometimes I can't taste or smell it at all, while other times it's way too overpowering. Is there any sort of general thumb rule for how much cinnamon to add?\n\n6) Corn syrup, molasses: Can I replace them with maple syrup? Honey? Sugar?\n\n7) Cream cheese and sour cream: Obviously if I'm making cream cheese frosting I'll get cream cheese, but for cake batter, can I replace cream cheese and/or sour cream with yoghurt? If not, then any other replacements?\n\nThank you all tremendously in advance and sorry for the long ass post haha.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1kcdvof/help_with_substitutions/", "created_utc": 1746119080.0, "score": 0, "author": "Old_Condition9030", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1kcdvof/help_with_substitutions/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Advice for a layered Honey Cake?", "selftext": "Hey all!\n\nI\u2019m attending a cake party next weekend and have been fine-tuning my idea, but I\u2019m running into issues in how to execute it. I really want to bring something that encompasses spring/summer/earthiness, so I\u2019m locked in on a layered honey cake with a blackberry jam and lavender SMBC. Problem is I\u2019m still more of a beginner when it comes to cakes from scratch, my finances are such that I can\u2019t afford to do a practice one, and I haven\u2019t been able to find anything that closely matches what I\u2019m after for the cake itself. \n\n99% of the results that pop up for me are for Russian honey cakes/similar, and that\u2019s almost the opposite of what I want. I want a lighter, more airy cake with slightly higher (and fewer) layers; I originally wanted to go with a chiffon because I\u2019d prefer to use oil over butter in the cake itself and I wanted that lighter texture, but I\u2019ve been seeing very mixed things on whether or not a chiffon will hold up to the 4 layers I\u2019m planning on (just two halved six-inch rounds).\n\nI am conflicted because to me the jam and SMBC wouldn\u2019t be adding all that much extra weight, and I won\u2019t be adding anything more for decoration than thin-ish layers of those. BUT I\u2019ve also never done a chiffon before and lack the experience to know whether I\u2019m crazy for that or not. \n\nI want the honey notes to be there, but delicate \u2014 not overpowering. There might also be hints of vanilla or almond (undecided). The closest  recipes I\u2019ve found to what I\u2019m looking for are this Honey Vanilla Layer Cake; a Yogurt & Honey Olive Oil Cake; and Lemon Olive Oil Honey Cake. \n\nI love the inclusion of the yogurt and olive oil in the latter two, but I\u2019m concerned how dense the crumb might be and whether they\u2019re too heavy for the jam layers. The former is more what I was originally looking for, but butter vs oil.\n\nThoughts? Should the crumb be light enough for the olive oil cakes? Could I 1:1 sub olive oil for butter on the former? Are there any hybrid sponges out there that I\u2019m overlooking? I could maybe/probably pull off something with moderate difficulty, but not advanced at this stage.

A while ago, I was baking on the regular bake setting at 350F. I noticed that after an hour of baking and almost another hour of added time, my stuff was coming out raw and burned on top. I put in an inside thermometer and it read that the internal oven temp was 250 F when I had set it to 350. An oven guy came and said that the fuse was messed up and so was the broiler.

The oven was set to 350. The brownies needed 25-29 minutes of baking so I set it for 25, thinking that the convection would speed up the baking process.

{"title": "Advice on cake recipe modifications", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm planning to gift a cake as a version of petit fours as a late Easter treat. I'm using a recipe from Claire Saffitz (in NYT Cooking) which I've already done twice before and came out perfectly. I'm asking for some advice and potential results you might expect if I make some modifications.\n\nThis is the base recipe for a versatile sponge cake:  \n4 eggs  \n100g sugar  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1/4 tsp cream of tartar (can't ever find this in my country so I skipped it)  \n50g veg oil  \n85g cake flour  \n2 tsp vanilla\n\n(160\u00baC 25-30' for a roll, 30-35' for a 9inch round pan)\n\nSo I've done this before for a vanilla sponge + whipped chocolate ganache yule log combo and it's perfect.\n\nHere's what I came up with and what I'd like to accomplish: a caramel cake cut in square (maybe two-bite) pieces, possibly with a mini sp\u00e9culoos cookie on top. In general, I don't want it to be too sweet and in terms of a petit four style, I want to avoid a glaze (fondant or otherwise). From my research, thinking about the easiest assembly, my best option might be a caramel buttercream, so I also thought about mixing in sp\u00e9culoos cookie crumbs to make it a bit more special. My go-to buttercream/frosting is ermine. I find it the easiest to make and not as sweet.  \nPicture this from top to bottom (wish I could draw):   \n\u00b7 dollop of buttercream, piped with a star tip and mini cookie on top - cupcake style.  \n\u00b7 layer of sponge cake.  \n\u00b7 layer of caramel buttercream with cookie crumbs in it.  \n\u00b7 layer of sponge cake.\n\nMy questions:  \n1. Instead of vanilla sponge cake, could I substitute the white sugar with brown, specifically panela, for flavor? Since it's not a butter cake, would the change affect the structure that much?  \n2. I've seen caramel sauce at the store with ingredients: glucose syrup, sugar, water, and conservative E-202. Would adding 2 tsp of this caramel instead of vanilla extract to the cake batter improve anything?   \n3. Is that caramel any good in general and/or could it balance the structure if I sub for panela (because of the glucose), in case it does affect it?  \n4. Thoughts on store caramel vs Caramel sauce (with cream and butter, which would add to my grocery list and expenses) in the buttercream?\n\nI wish I had money and time to test all combinations. Any other ideas are welcome.

The slice looks super sloppy in this pic because I didn\u2019t think it was going to be salvageable, but I was surprised the inner cake and flan both turned out pretty good. I also cut the slice while it was upside down because I wanted to see how thick the burnt crust was.\n\nThe cake also has some dark moist spots where it meets the flan layer.

I took the pic while it was sorta warm too and didn\u2019t really notice the spots later when I had the cooled slices cleaned up. \n\nSo obviously 500 degrees is a high heat.

{"title": "Are Kitchenaid mixers just underpowered?", "selftext": "Hey, any mixer-heads out there? I could really use some advice from people who know their way around mixers and bread dough. TL;DR: I just now realized that a Kitchenaid customer service rep is occupationally unable to tell me if Kitchenaid mixers are underpowered or not. \n\nLast week, I bought a Kitchenaid 6qt. Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer (model KSM60SECXER) to replace a Kitchenaid Ultra Power 4qt. Tilt-Head Stand Mixer (model KSM90) that's over thirty years old. I make an 80%-hydration 100%-whole-wheat sandwich loaf twice a week, the old mixer usually gets the job done somewhere between ten and twenty-five minutes. After calibrating the bowl height with the dime test twice to make sure I had it right, I followed the mixer directions and put the dough hook on and set the mixer to Speed 2 to work on my dough. It stirred it for over half an hour before I gave up and jammed the speed up to like 6 or 7 until it finally came together into a shaggy ball.\n\nOkay, fine, so maybe it needs some more work with a paddle first until the gluten works up a bit? Today I set it up and when the knead came, I put on the mixing paddle and let it go. After two minutes, some of the dough was in a clump on the center of the paddle and the larger part of the dough was all along the bowl, just out of paddle reach (so much for the 'dime test'). So I swapped out for the dough hook and let it go on Speed 2 only and this time it took over an hour to come together. An hour to knead dough following directions? My recipe uses warmed liquid, letting the dough sit in the mixer for an hour is jacking up my timeline and messing up my proves, today's loaf tore out something awful from underproving.\n\nSo, what the hell, right? I went to Kitchenaid's support portal and read some articles. From https://www.kitchenaid.ca/en_ca/blog/o/tips-for-making-bread-stand-mixer.html\n\n>Mix bread dough for no more than 2 minutes and then, depending on the recipe, knead for 2\u20134 minutes. Make sure you avoid over-kneading by adapting the hand-kneading time required in your favourite recipes.\n\n>2 minutes might not seem like a lot of time compared to hand-kneaded dough, but a KitchenAid\u00ae mixer is meant to alleviate some of the work, reduce the time and increase your efficiency when you knead bread dough.\n\n>...\n\n>A perfectly kneaded dough should form into a ball and clean the sides of the bowl. Remember, though, that this is dependent on if your ingredients were properly measured and mixed.\n\n...huh? It should be getting the job done in *six minutes*? \"It only takes this long to knead bread dough and if it takes longer, it means you screwed up your measures.\" That's like telling me that the axe I bought doesn't chop wood because I'm chopping the wrong kind. No, mixer, *I* choose what I'm kneading and *you* do the job, but I can see that Kitchenaid is going to be heavily invested in telling me its my fault. And it's about that time that I realize: Kitchenaid's position is that any malfunction of the product is due to user error or faulty equipment, *they can never admit that their product is underpowered* as I now suspect it is. I refuse to get involved in a game of shipping a mixer back and forth to a repair facility (which is just not having a mixer with extra steps) when they can never make it do the thing I need it to while also being completely unable to admit to me that it never will. \n\nSo I can't trust Kitchenaid to tell me a true answer to what I now ask you: are Kitchenaid mixers legitimately functional via some method as yet unknown to me or is it an underpowered consumer model that only pretends to be capable equipment because most home users won't use it to make bread? I don't want to go back to the old one, I actually need the larger capacity, but one hour to knead dough is completely unacceptable. Has anyone else had an experience with a KA bowl-lift where it seemed to work normally but was actually malfunctioning and was actually capable after replacement?\n\nI am one more bad loaf away from returning this thing to where I bought it for a refund.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1k4mdtj/are_kitchenaid_mixers_just_underpowered/", "created_utc": 1745263992.0, "score": 0, "author": "Hemisemidemiurge", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1k4mdtj/are_kitchenaid_mixers_just_underpowered/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Why did my brioche not rise?", "selftext": "Yesterday I made two brioches for easter as I have done for the last four years or so. This time, I was using a different (and generally much better) oven. When I put the first one in, it still looked kinda raw after 20 minutes, but it usually should have been done at that point. There was next to no raise and no browning. I turned the temperature up from 180 C to 200 C and then very soon down to 190 C because I thought 200 would be too hot. It started to brown quite quickly and looked done after another 5 - 8 minutes or so but still, next to no rise. I baked the second one (which was half the size) at 190 C and it basically behaved exactly as it should, browned nicely and rose the way it had always done.\n\nI made both loaves basically the same (although I'm not too precise so there could be some general variation), in two batches. I think the big one got more time to proof but I didn't notice much rise in either at that point. But I'm also awful at discerning that so I don't think it means much.\n\nThe only major difference was the oven temperature, which suggests that that is the issue. But a difference of 10 degrees sounds a bit too small to affect the brioche so drastically. Additionally, I didn't think baking temperature had that much of an impact on rise. I figured it would just take longer to rise and brown and be maybe a bit denser but not solid like mine was. Maybe the yeast was dead? But for both I used satchels from the same box (freshly bought) and mixed them in the same way, so I don't see why one batch of yeast should be dead when the other wasn't.

{"title": "Pineapple Buns / Bolo Bao not rising properly", "selftext": "Having some problems getting the buns to puff/rise like you see in [asian bakeries](https://www.afoodieworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_1977_dkbf1r.jpg). The buns seem to deflate after putting the cookie crumb on the bun. Looking for some tips or advice.\n\nBaking Kristina Cho's pineapple buns recipe linked [here](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pineapple-buns).\n\nI've made the following changes to the recipe  \n\\- 1 tsp of SAF Instant Yeast instead of 1 tsp of active dry yeast  \n\\- Kneaded for 3 extra minutes to incorporate more flour (dough looked too sticky/wet after kneading).  \n\\- Second proof was 2 hours instead of 45m-1hr  \n\\- Baked with a layer of paper towels under the parchment paper to prevent the bottoms from burning/drying out.  \n\\- Used entire egg as wash instead of just egg-yolk on the topping. Eggs are expensive these days :sob:\n\n  \nLeft / Right had slightly different kneading styles and baking temps since I've had problems with burned bottoms in the past. Seems like 350F is the way to go.  \n340F vs 350F  \nFolding inward to create a ball vs gentle kneading\n\nHere are a few guesses I have as to why the buns deflate.  \n\\- Too much yeast. 1 tsp of active dry is supposedly equivalent to 3/4 tsp of instant yeast  \n\\- Over-kneading, causing the bread to become too tough  \n\\- Over-proofing, causing the bread to not hold its shape under the weight of the cookie crumb.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.

{"title": "Getting more cake pans", "selftext": "Hello, I started baking a couple months ago and I have wanted to get better at decorating and making cakes as I enjoy it. I've been using some 9x2\" fat daddio pans and they've been nice, but it's a lot of cake and I want to take it down to 6\" pans to try and make taller cakes too for more room. The issue is, even after looking things up and looking on this subreddit, I'm not too sure on some things so I thought I'd ask. I'm good at math too so if you need to use it to explain anything, I'm good with it.\n\nSo first off, 2\" or 3\" sides on the cake pans? Would it hurt getting the 3\" over the 2\"? Looking at a lot of conversion charts and doing some math, if I had a 2 9x2\" cake recipe, and using 3 6x3\" pans, h\\*pi\\*r\\^2 for volume shows that these are equal in volume, or for surface area, 2 9x2\" is \\~127 and 3 6x3\" is \\~84, or exactly a ratio of 1.5. So if I'm thinking about this correctly, I could reduce the 9x2\" recipe by 1.5x and have the perfect amount of batter for the 6\" pans (Of course I would overshoot some). I've seen some people say that you can half 8x2\" recipe's for 3 6x3\" pans and have enough. This all is with the idea that I actually get 3\" instead of 2\". Also, how would this affect cooking times? I've seen people say to \"watch and check\" the cakes as they cook, but as an amateur, is there anything else I can watch, look, or prep for in that regard?\n\nFor reference, I'm planning on making a lemon cake with raspberry frosting probably from this recipe (https://preppykitchen.com/lemon-cake/#recipe) which is a 8x2\" recipe, but I will definitely be making more cakes from 9x2\" recipes as well so I'd like some clarification.

I only have one 8-inch pan so I've been doing it one layer at a time. I use cake strips as well. First layer came out after cooling in the pan for about 20 minutes with no issue. Glazed it with the cherry syrup and its been moved to the freezer, a success. My two subsequent layers have been a disaster. I regreased, floured, and parchment lined the pan after the first layer had cooled, used the cake strips, but my second layer would not come out of the pan and eventually only half came out. Because of this disaster I did a massively thoroughly clean of everything I was using, let it dry, then greased, floured, and parchmented the pan again. Baked the remainder of my batter, let it cool for even longer as I had a work meeting, then came out to turn it out and it was just as difficult as the second one! I ran a sharp knife around the edges before i tried to turn it out (I did this for the second one too), and I basically hung the pan upside down for another 20 minutes before it slid out.

I also still don\u2019t think they have much flavor. I can\u2019t figure out why this is happening or how to troubleshoot.\n\n\n\nHi there! Long-time lurker, first-time poster.\n\nI recently decided to make some chocolate chip cookies to gift, and after tons of research, I settled on the famous **NYT Chocolate Chip Cookies (the Jacques Torres recipe)** and splurged a bit on the ingredients.\n\nI watched Vaughn\u2019s video comparing different versions, read countless comments and reviews on blogs, Reddit, and YouTube, dove into articles on cookie science, and basically fell head-first into a baking rabbit hole. I figured I was ready to start testing the recipe.\n\n\n\n### First Attempt:\n- Paper-thin cookies  \n- Super spread-out  \n- Very chewy and greasy  \n- So bad texture-wise my mom actually had to spit one out  \nBUT\u2014I left them in a cardboard box to make space in the kitchen, and to my surprise, after 2 days they were perfect (to me): crunchy, like thinner Chips Ahoy. Still lacked depth of flavor though.\n\n*I kept researching and learned that European butter doesn\u2019t behave the same as American butter, and one Redditor mentioned that when using European butter, they reduce the amount to **75%**, and it works great for all recipes. I decided to try that.*\n\n\n### Second Attempt:\n- Used 75% butter  \n- Slightly more vanilla (1.5 tsp instead of 1 tsp)  \n- Everything else followed as written  \n\nThe cookies came out *gorgeous*\u2014crunchy, golden, and held their shape well. Fresh out of the oven, they were beautifully crisp, maybe just slightly overbaked (testers and I agreed 1\u20132 mins less would\u2019ve been ideal). Still... flavor was underwhelming.\n\nI left them **uncovered at room temperature**, and the next day\u2026 **they were chewy**. Not soft in a good way\u2014just strangely chewy. They went from *slightly dry* to chewy in less than 24 hours.\n\n\nI\u2019m not trying to get chewy cookies\u2014I loved that initial crunch. I know this recipe is *meant* to be chewy, but I don\u2019t understand how they went from crunchy/sliiiiiightly dry/overbaked to chewy with time. Most people complain about their cookies drying out or getting hard, not turning softer overnight \ud83d\ude2d.\n\n\n\n### Things to Note:\n- I weighed everything in grams  \n- Made half the recipe  \n- Browned the butter, then added back the evaporated liquid as water (weighed)  \n- Let butter re-solidify before creaming\u2014never used melted butter  \n- Used 1.5 tsp vanilla extract instead of 1 tsp to see if it added more flavor \u2014it did not\n- Left cookies *uncovered*, exposed to air  \n- Room temperature is cool\u2014not hot or humid  \n- Pre-scooped dough before chilling  \n- Both batches rested 60\u201370 hours in the fridge  \n- Oven temp verified with an external thermometer. \n- Both attempts baked for 18-19 mins.\n\n\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **Butter:** Kerrygold unsalted (100% for batch 1, 75% for batch 2)  \n- **Vanilla:** Nielsen-Massey extract\n- **Chocolate:** Callebaut callets  \n- **Flour:** Gluten-free, 4.4% protein (I\u2019m coeliac\u2014this is the only one I can get, and Vaughn and other comments said GF was fine)  \n- **Sugars:** High-quality local white and brown sugar  \n   - First batch: followed recipe  \n   - Second batch: added more white, less brown (same total weight) to reduce chewiness\u2014didn\u2019t help  \n- **Salt:** Non-iodized sea salt (dough) + Maldon flakes (on top after baking)\n- **Egg:** 1 egg, weighed to match US \u201clarge\u201d (50g)  \n- **Leavening:** Baking soda & powder, measured exactly and tested for freshness, not expired\n\n \n\n### So\u2026 What\u2019s Going On?\n\n- Why did the second batch lose its crunch and turn chewy overnight?\n- Why does the flavor feel kind of flat? Is it *normal* for these cookies to \u201clack flavor\u201d?\n- Could the flour or sugar swap be the issue?\n- How do I preserve that amazing crunch?\n\n\n\nAny insight, tips, or advice would be super appreciated! Thank you!\n\n*P.S. I plan on vacuum sealing my final batch to send, so I don\u2019t know if doing so will preserve the crunchiness.*\n\nLink to the recipe, no paywalls: https://archive.is/mrapi  ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1jyj3f2/my_crunchy_nyt_choc_chip_cookies_turned_chewy/", "created_utc": 1744581182.0, "score": 1, "author": "imyourdorito", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1jyj3f2/my_crunchy_nyt_choc_chip_cookies_turned_chewy/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "ISSUE - Grainy All Mascarpone Cheesecake", "selftext": "tl;dr  \nMy all mascarpone cheesecake came out grainy and did not completely set. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\\----------------------\n\nI wanted to test out what would happen if I replaced the cream cheese in a cheesecake with all mascarpone. The results were grainy and unset custard.\n\nI expected issues so I made half of recipe in a 6\" springform pan.\n\nThe Recipe:  \n\\- 16 oz of mascarpone  \n\\- 1/2 cup sugar  \n\\- 2 eggs  \n\\- 1 Tbsp coconut extract  \n\\- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n\nThe Process\n\nMixing everything in my stand mixer, the ingredients seemed to have come together just fine. I even thought I might have overmixed, but the custard didn't curdle and seemed smooth, maybe too fluffy if anything, Put the custard in the 6\" pan with a vanilla wafer crust and in a water bath at 325 degrees. Lightly covered with tinfoil\n\nI knew something wasn't right when it wasn't set in the \\~40 min I had expected it to set in. It was also very liquidy and the edges were barely starting to set. I figured this was going to be be the caveat with using all mascarpone. Thinking that because it's more like a butter than a cheese, the custard would be more \"melty\" as a cooked.\n\nI uncovered the cheesecake and let bake for a full hour. Let it cool on counter overnight and refrigerated in the morning until I cut into it this evening.\n\nThe Result\n\nThe center was not completely set. My main concern and question that I have is: it was very grainy. Why is it so grainy? Although I felt I might have overmixed the custard, it was smooth before going into the oven.\n\nOverall\n\nI definitely want an all mascarpone cheesecake. Aside from it being more of a grainy pudding, flavor-wise it was delicious. I just need thoughts as to what to do to make it set and make it less grainy.\n\nQuestions\n\nDid the mascarpone somehow curdle while baking? Since eggs are emulsifiers that help keep things mixed, can I add more eggs to counteract the curdling? That adds more liquid so should I add cornstarch as a thickener or would that also just add graininess to it. Should I lower the temp and bake for longer?\n\nPlease help!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/9mynl9i9z4ue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744347049.0, "score": 1, "author": "ChimiChango8", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1jwhwjx/issue_grainy_all_mascarpone_cheesecake/", "html_title": ""}

We made the maddest orange cake ever! It was 2 boxes, one lemon and one white. We added: \n\n* 2 family size boxes of orange jello\n* zest from 2 blood oranges and 2 cara caras\n* a can of pelligrino blood orange soda\n* 2+ teaspoons of orange oil\n* 2+ teaspoons of orange extract\n* a ton of extra yellow/red food coloring\n\nAll the requested water for the cake mix was blood orange and cara cara juice.\n\nI put all the jello powder and zest in initially and did the sugar spin thing to really get the zest working.\n\nThen, I put in everything but the cake mix and soda and beat it together for what seemed like longer than needed. Dumped in cake mix, topped with soda, and brought just together. My kitchen smelled amazing.\n\nI made a cream cheese frosting with 16oz light cream cheese (I know, I'm weird, but it's tangy-er), 6oz unsalted butter, half a lemon's juice, some vanilla extract and just enough powdered sugar to make it pass for frosting. The cake was crazy sweet, but the frosting played just right.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nSo apparently there's a shortage of DH orange cake mix.  It's selling for $8/box on Amazon!  I'm great with yeast baking, but cakes aren't my thing.  I took Alton Brown's comment long ago about the frosting being the big thing and just using a box.  I make great frosting.  How do I know/guess two things about a cake recipe online:\n\n1. will it be a light fluffy cake, rather than a dense pound-cake like thing? I need to be able to build layers and cover in fondant.\n2. Will it be orangey enough.  We like strong flavors here.  Actually, let's just assume it won't be, how can I add more?\n\nI don't have time to test recipes, I didn't fathom not having cake mix available.  Need a cake tomorrow night.  I have the box of vanilla pudding mix to add to the box cake (someone taught me this years ago and it's always been good) - to get that 50/50 bar \\\\ dreamcicle flavor.

{"title": "My oven is ruining every single thing I bake, never had this issue need help!", "selftext": "I need help because this issue is driving me absolutely insane and today again another baked good is ruined and about 6 hours of my day is wasted.\n\nI\u2019ve been baking about 7 years, I started out making homemade bread, then pastries and cakes, I\u2019ve perfected a good few items such as Japanese milk bread, croissants, baguettes just to name a few. That is, until I moved into my house.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in a less than savory apartment, with a 20 year old oven. Everything came out perfect. I lived in a brand new apartment with a 1-2 year old oven, no issues but this god forsaken oven in my home\u2026. I don\u2019t know what I can do to remedy this.\n\nWhen we first moved in I wanted to make a loaf of white bread. I did what I usually do. Let it rise in the Pullman pan and put it in the oven to bake. After about 15 minutes I smelled something burning. I opened the oven to wfind the entirety of the loaf somehow black, with the Pullman lid on and the whole middle of the loaf just raw dough. It was not salvageable. I assumed it may be operator error and moved on. \n\nA few weeks later I tried to make banana bread, I kid you not\u2026 after baking for over 3 hours in a loaf pan, I finally took the bread out and wouldn\u2019t you guess? The middle was still raw, and the outside nearly burnt.\n\nI\u2019ve tried covering the goods with foil and lids, it still burns. My egg or milk wash always burns nearly immediately, about 10 or 15 minutes into the oven at temps between 320-350. \n\nMy last straw was today. I made pan au chocolate. After about 5 hours laminating, and hard work,  letting the dough rise, it looked amazing. I had so many negative thoughts about it going into the oven, but I told myself it would be okay. \n\nAfter 5 minutes in the oven, the butter started to seep into the pan which I already knew meant that the temperature of the oven could not be correct. I refrigerated my dough after rising but before baking to ensure my butter was cold and used European butter as opposed to American. I don\u2019t believe my laminating or rising process was to blame. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, the entire pan was filled with butter, which has only happened to me a few times when I was still learning to make croissants but hasn\u2019t happened for years. And you guess, the egg wash was black. All of them were ruined. The outside burnt to a crisp, cooking in butter and still raw dough in the middle. \n\nBefore writing this post I cried. This oven has ruined every single baked good I\u2019ve put in it, and I\u2019ve never had these types of issues. I used to make a fresh loaf of bread for my daughter\u2019s sandwiches for school. I\u2019d make baguettes for pasta nights, or croissants as a weekend treat. I\u2019ve made nearly every cake for my kids birthdays and this oven has defeated me. \n\nI\u2019ve tried looking online but haven\u2019t found too much for this specific oven. It\u2019s an LG oven/ stove. I will say it bakes frozen pizzas perfectly fine but that is it. That\u2019s all we use the oven part  for besides me baking. \n\nIs there any way I can fix this? I\u2019ve tried the normal baking option, it does this, I\u2019ve tried the convection option, it does this but just speed runs the burning. I\u2019ve read the manual of the oven and there\u2019s no settings or anything I can change.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks!

{"title": "American mascarpone always curdling while making tiramisu", "selftext": "Why do I say \"american\"? I made [this tiramisu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rZn4yWFeXQ) in Poland with their mascarpone, which I think was Galbani (but I'm pretty sure I used other ones too), and it turned out perfect first try and all the times I have made it regularly since; I didn't stress about editing the recipe to slowly incorporate everything in batches or to match the temperatures of the ingredients. When I moved to the US, I started using their mascarpone, it was Belgioioso, the only one I found. This curdled badly when I used it first. I think I tried a second time, paying a bit more attention to temperature, same thing. Then I used [this recipe](https://youtu.be/V9uApXYaWs4?si=wQlmkh1MYneY_8xk), which was more authentic and didn't use heavy cream, but also had no gentle folding, but I thought making my own mascarpone would fix it (I made it with some regular store-bought heavy cream), but no, curdled again. Then I had a final try today, I thought maybe it was the temperature again, and I paid extra attention, using the same Belgioioso mascarpone and using the first recipe. First, when I whipped the mascarpone, I noticed it wouldn't get smooth, it looked more like thick buttercream, but I thought I could still incorporate this. When I did, in small batches now, and gently folding almost as if I am working with a meringue, I saw tiny white spots again, meaning it was starting to get curdled. Once I incorporated it all, it looked totally curdled. I added the whipped cream, also folding, and that didnt help ([photos here](https://imgur.com/a/DOO7P27)). I tried to save it by adding cream and whipping with electric beaters, that broke up the tiny white specks, but then they became bigger again and curdled even more. This batch was done.  \nSo, what is the problem? Is it american dairy, or is it me? What can I do to fix this next time? I have an idea of making mascarpone again but with organic, low-temp pasteurized heavy cream, but I'm not sure if the dairy is even the problem.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1jrsbpz/american_mascarpone_always_curdling_while_making/", "created_utc": 1743816993.0, "score": 0, "author": "denis03201052", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1jrsbpz/american_mascarpone_always_curdling_while_making/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Meringue SOS - I give up", "selftext": "My friend's birthday is coming up and I figured I'd make her mini pavlovas, since she loves them and they were supposed to be easy to makes. I mean, just whip some eggs, bake them and add simple frosting. 30 minutes adventure, right?\n\nWrong. I take my hand mixer, bowl, separate 2 eggs, measure 100g of sugar and start adding it when the eggs get frothy tbsp at a time with at least a minute interval (as the recipe specified). I was about half way through the sugar when it reached stiff peaks I kept adding sugar, but in the end it never dissolved properly (even when I mixed for 5 more minutes after adding everything, since some recipes recommended that). I tried multiple other things such as slowing my hand mixer, using different bowl, adding sugar faster, adding sugar slower, cold eggs, room-temp eggs, acid, no acid, non of the batches turned out as it was supposed to. That was 6 cartons of eggs ago.\n\nSo I figured my hand mixer may be the problem and decided to make swiss meringue. It only makes sense since the sugar doesn't dissolve, dissolve it before whipping. So I pop a bowl with egg whites, sugar, salt and lemon juice over a double boiler and get to work. I used silicon spatula to constantly mix the eggs and make sure to scrape the sides. I used thermometer, once they reached about 120F everything was dissolved I got to whipping. It never whipped to stiff peaks. It just deflated and became droopy. So again, I get to experimenting, cooking eggs to 170F, a bit more sugar, a bit less sugar, dehumidifying the kitchen, cleaning everything with vinegar, different egg sources, whipping faster, slower, and so on. It never got to stiff peaks, usually it just ended droopy and deflated. That was 3 cartons of eggs ago.\n\nSo now I'm also deflated. I'm taking this personally. How hard can making a damned meringue be?! So here I am asking for any lifeline before I go to buy a stand mixer.\n\nGeneral ratios I used 2 medium eggs (~60-70g total egg white), 80-100g of sugar (the right kind), a few drops - 0.5 tsp of lemon juice, pinch of salt. 2 batches were successful 1 french, 1 swiss, but I honestly have no idea what worked out, since I couldn't reproduce the success again doing the same thing.\n\nHelp", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1jpmhwg/meringue_sos_i_give_up/", "created_utc": 1743594162.0, "score": 1, "author": "lans_throwaway", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1jpmhwg/meringue_sos_i_give_up/", "html_title": ""}

I have understood that this is a type of flour with lower protein content which is not as strong as for example all-purpose flour or bread flour. This results in a pastry/cake/whatever with less gluten structure and a softer texture. When advised on substitutions, people online say you can add cornstarch/corn flour to all-purpose flour, or you can sift all-purpose flour multiple times.\n\nIf I understand correctly, with adding cornstarch, since there is no protein in cornstarch (?) you are basically diluting the wheat flour and the protein content. Is real cake flour wheat flour with less protein content or is it also diluted with cornstarch? \n\nWhy would sifting the flour multiple times reduce the protein content/make the flour weaker?

{"title": "Adding Blueberries to Yeasted Waffle Batter", "selftext": "Howdy all! \n\nI've had a serious hankering for waffles lately, and finally caved and bought myself a Belgian waffle maker (Cuisinart WAF-F30) that I'm planning to christen this weekend using Stella Parks brown butter yeasted waffle recipe (https://www.seriouseats.com/brown-butter-yeast-raised-waffles-recipe)\n\nStella's recipes have never failed me, so I'm planning to make them as written, but I did want to add blueberries, and I had a few questions:\n\n1) At what point should I add the blueberries to the batter? \n\nBecause they're leavened with yeast, and I don't want to risk affecting the fermentation process I was planning to gently fold them in right before I start putting batter into the waffle maker, but if there's a reason to do it the night before (or any other time) I'm all ears. \n\n2) Should I do anything to the blueberries before folding them in? \n\nMost recipes I've found recommend adding them as-is, but one recipe recommended tossing them lightly in flour, so I thought I'd ask. \n\n3) What kind of blueberries are going to give me the best tasting results? \n\nI've read recipes that recommend jumbo, regular, or wild as far as size, and fresh or frozen as far as preparation, so it seems like opinions are all over the place. \n\nMy favorite blueberries to eat fresh are jumbo blueberries.

{"title": "Need Help: Cinnamon Roll Reconstruction Fail", "selftext": "I started baking cinnamon rolls and doughnuts about a year ago and love it. I'm attempting to reconstruct my favorite cinnamon rolls from a childhood bakery I moved away from years ago. I've failed six times so far and could use any help/suggestions. They have the consistency of a doughnut rather than the bread-like texture of a cinnamon roll. They are very moist and are covered in a light glaze.\n\nThe picture is how the cinnamon rolls should turn out. First tried baking a traditional cinnamon roll recipe using bread flour and changing the thickness I roll the dough. That did not work. Next I tried cake flour. Then I tried AP flour. Neither of those worked. Then I got the idea the rolls might be deep fried like a doughnut because of the center line in the picture. Fried doughnuts often have that same center line. So tried a Cake/AP flour mix as well as a bread flour dough and fried the batches in oil. The cinnamon roll filling all fell out while frying and the rolls did not turn out anything like the above picture.\n\nI'm open to any suggestions. I've looked up coffee-roll recipes because they look similar to the picture, but have not found one that turns out remotely like them. Below is the recipe and directions I have been using as a base for the reconstruction.\n\n* Dough Ingredients\n   * 4 cups Cake Flour\n   * 1 cup sugar\n   * 1 tsp salt\n   * 2 eggs (room temp)\n   * 1/2 cup salted butter\n   * 1 cup milk\n   * 6 Tbsp vegetable oil\n   * 3 tsp active dry yeast\n* Filling Ingredients\n   * 1 cup salted butter (softened, room temp)\n   * 2 cup packed brown sugar\n   * 4 Tbsp cinnamon\n* Glaze\n   * 4 cups powdered sugar\n   * 1 tsp vanilla extract\n   * 7 Tbsp milk\n   * Pinch of salt\n\n1. Make the Dough\n   1. Add cake flour, sugar, and salt to a large bowl and mix (4 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp salt)\n   2. In another small bowl beat eggs (2 room temp eggs)\n   3. In a small pot, melt butter over low heat. Whisk in milk, oil, and beaten egg. Stir constantly until 106F (1/2 cup salted butter, 1 cup milk\\*\\*\\*, 6Tbsp vegetable oil\\*\\*\\*, beaten eggs)\n   4. Once 106F (no more than 110F), pour into bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk yeast into mixture. Let it bloom for 10 min. (3 tsp active dry yeast\\*\\*\\*). Reading the back of the yeast container, also calls for 1 tsp sugar when blooming.\n   5. Fit mixer paddle attachment and add flout into bowl. Mix on low until just combined.\n   6. Switch to dough hook and turn speed to medium high for approximately 12 minutes. Dough is ready when it passes window test (pull at dough and if it spreads thin so you can barely see light through it, it is done)\n   7. Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap. Proof in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Back of yeast jar says warm place 80-85F.\u00a0\n2. Make the Filling\n   1. In a medium bowl, combine soft butter, brown sugar, cinnamon. Mix with fork (1 cup salted butter, 2 cup brown sugar, 4 Tbsp cinnamon)\n3. Prepare the Rolls\n   1. Sprinkle work surface with flour. Turn out the dough onto the surface and sprinkle the top of the dough and roller with additional flour.\u00a0\n   2. Roll the dough into 15\u201dx8\u201d and make sure the dough is 1/2\u201d thick.\u00a0\n   3. Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle.\n   4. Starting on the long side, roll the dough up tightly, jelly roll style\n   5. Measure and cut the roll into 1\u201d slices.\n   6. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly spray with nonstick cooking spray.\u00a0 Place the roll slices on it. Wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours.\n4. Prepare the Glaze\n   1. Mix the powdered sugar, vanilla extract (or maple extract), milk, and pinch of salt in a large bowl by a fork. Mix until very runny. (4 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla|maple extract, 7+ Tbsp of milk, pinch of salt)\n5. Frying the Cinnamon Rolls\n   1. Pour 2\u201d of oil into Pot a heat until oil is 355F. Adjust your heat to keep the temp between 350-360F while frying. Heat until 360F because adding rolls will lower temperature.\n   2. Allow cinnamon rolls to sit at room temperature for 6 minutes before frying (pull several out of refrigerator at a time)\n   3. Gently place 3-5 rolls into the fryer. Leave space for them to puff, don\u2019t crowd them.\n   4. Once they rise to the surface, cook for 60 seconds and then flip them. Fry for about 45 seconds or until bottom gets golden brown color. Flip it again and fry for another 10-30 seconds or until golden brown color on the other side.\u00a0\n   5. Transfer to a wire rack set over a sheet pan.\n   6. Allow oil to drip off for 10 seconds, then dip them into the glaze.

If I let my sheets cool for longer than 30 min, then I\u2019m wasting electricity by keeping the oven on or wasting time by turning it off then on again for each batch.

{"title": "Cream cheese frosting alternative for wedding cake", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI've just posted this question in r/Baking, before realising that this is probably a much better place for it! Grateful for any help or input.\n\nI am a reasonably competent amateur baker, but by no means an expert. Against my better judgment, I have volunteered to make a wedding cake in a couple of weeks' time. I am making three types of cake for the different tiers (which will be presented \"deconstructed\", so structural integrity is not a massive issue here). Two of those tiers are traditionally served with cream cheese frosting - a chocolate Guinness cake, and a carrot cake.\n\nI am in Europe, and therefore only have access to the type of Philadelphia that comes in tubs, not blocks. The cake will be stored at room temperature for about 8 hours before being served.\n\nI am worried that a cream cheese frosting, or even a cream cheese buttercream blend, will not hold up for that length of time. I have done a trial run of a cream cheese buttercream blend, in which the butter and icing sugar are combined first before adding the cream cheese. This is supposed to prevent the icing sugar from bonding to the water in the cream cheese, and therefore prevent the mixture going runny. This worked OK, but I'm nervous about whether it would last all day.\n\nMy current backup plan is to go with plain old buttercream, with some lemon zest and juice. This would be complementary for the carrot cake I think, and I'm hoping I can use just a hint of lemon in the Guinness tier buttercream to achieve a slight cream cheese-esque tang.\n\nBut I'm also worried that the chocolate and lemon flavours will clash horribly. Anyone got any better ideas? I'm stumped!\n\nI appreciate that going back to the drawing board with the actual cakes might be a solution, but I'm fond of the Guinness cake and I'd like to persist with it if at all possible.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1je994l/cream_cheese_frosting_alternative_for_wedding_cake/", "created_utc": 1742315755.0, "score": 1, "author": "TealSkies33", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1je994l/cream_cheese_frosting_alternative_for_wedding_cake/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Help with substitutions", "selftext": "I don't really know how Reddit works, and if this is \"allowed\", but I posted this on r/Baking and I'm copy-pasting my post directly here:\n\nI'm a somewhat beginner baker\u2014I'm pretty good at baking with recipes and even improvising a bit, but I don't really understand the\u00a0*why*\u00a0behind a lot of it\u2014and so I have a lot of questions about substitutions, and searching online confuses me more because I end up getting seven different answers, so I thought I'd compile my questions, and that way I could get specific answers.\n\n1. I don't have (or want to buy, because nobody in my house is going to use it) espresso powder, but I really want to make coffee-flavoured things, or add a coffee note to chocolate cakes, brownies etc. I have dark roasted ground coffee with chicory. I don't think I can just directly replace the espresso powder with ground coffee since it doesn't dissolve. In cake recipes where there's water or milk, I've tried to replace varying amounts of the liquid with brewed coffee or coffee with milk, but I can never taste it when it's done, even when I can definitely smell it in the batter.\n\na) Can I just replace espresso powder with coffee powder?\n\ni) If so, then in what ratio?\n\nii) If not, then what else can I do?\n\nb) What about when there's liquid\u2014how much of it should I replace, and how strong should the coffee be?\n\n2) I really like the taste of brown sugar, but substituting it 1:1 (which is the advice I generally saw online) changes the texture of the cake. I really like the texture of \"Depression Cake\", and I've made it vanilla-flavoured before by just substituting the cocoa powder for more flour, but when I replaced even just half of the sugar with brown sugar (dark brown, it's the only variety I have), it became really dense and not spongy at all. For cookies and cakes using the creaming method it worked perfectly, but not for this. How can I do it for cakes like this?\n\n3) Butter: how can I replace it with oil in cake recipes, because generally I've found that ones with oil are much more moist, which is definitely how I like my cakes. For recipes using melted butter I've just directly replaced it with oil 1:1, but I'm not sure about how to do it for creaming/reverse creaming method recipes. If I can't replace it, any tips on how to make them more moist?\n\n4) Butter again: I generally use salted butter and just don't add additional salt and it's perfectly fine, but when it involves brown butter, it becomes wayyy too salty. I bought unsalted butter, but when I melted it, it smelt so bad. The only way I can describe it is the smell of when you're cooking ghee at home (iykyk). Any replacements? Or any tips on how to make it not smell?\n\n5) Cinnamon: this one isn't about substitution, but more of how much to use. I don't have cinnamon powder, I grate cinnamon sticks instead. I've followed the amount specified in recipes, and sometimes I can't taste or smell it at all, while other times it's way too overpowering. Is there any sort of general thumb rule for how much cinnamon to add?\n\n6) Corn syrup, molasses: Can I replace them with maple syrup? Honey? Sugar?\n\n7) Cream cheese and sour cream: Obviously if I'm making cream cheese frosting I'll get cream cheese, but for cake batter, can I replace cream cheese and/or sour cream with yoghurt? If not, then any other replacements?\n\nThank you all tremendously in advance and sorry for the long ass post haha.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1kcdvof/help_with_substitutions/", "created_utc": 1746119080.0, "score": 0, "author": "Old_Condition9030", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1kcdvof/help_with_substitutions/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I really want to bring something that encompasses spring/summer/earthiness, so I\u2019m locked in on a layered honey cake with a blackberry jam and lavender SMBC. Problem is I\u2019m still more of a beginner when it comes to cakes from scratch, my finances are such that I can\u2019t afford to do a practice one, and I haven\u2019t been able to find anything that closely matches what I\u2019m after for the cake itself. \n\n99% of the results that pop up for me are for Russian honey cakes/similar, and that\u2019s almost the opposite of what I want. I want a lighter, more airy cake with slightly higher (and fewer) layers; I originally wanted to go with a chiffon because I\u2019d prefer to use oil over butter in the cake itself and I wanted that lighter texture, but I\u2019ve been seeing very mixed things on whether or not a chiffon will hold up to the 4 layers I\u2019m planning on (just two halved six-inch rounds).\n\nI am conflicted because to me the jam and SMBC wouldn\u2019t be adding all that much extra weight, and I won\u2019t be adding anything more for decoration than thin-ish layers of those. BUT I\u2019ve also never done a chiffon before and lack the experience to know whether I\u2019m crazy for that or not. \n\nI want the honey notes to be there, but delicate \u2014 not overpowering. There might also be hints of vanilla or almond (undecided). The closest  recipes I\u2019ve found to what I\u2019m looking for are this Honey Vanilla Layer Cake; a Yogurt & Honey Olive Oil Cake; and Lemon Olive Oil Honey Cake. \n\nI love the inclusion of the yogurt and olive oil in the latter two, but I\u2019m concerned how dense the crumb might be and whether they\u2019re too heavy for the jam layers. The former is more what I was originally looking for, but butter vs oil.\n\nThoughts? Should the crumb be light enough for the olive oil cakes? Could I 1:1 sub olive oil for butter on the former? Are there any hybrid sponges out there that I\u2019m overlooking? I could maybe/probably pull off something with moderate difficulty, but not advanced at this stage.

A while ago, I was baking on the regular bake setting at 350F. I noticed that after an hour of baking and almost another hour of added time, my stuff was coming out raw and burned on top. I put in an inside thermometer and it read that the internal oven temp was 250 F when I had set it to 350. An oven guy came and said that the fuse was messed up and so was the broiler. My papa thinks that it may be a circuit since even though the regular bake setting is messed up, the convection is perfectly fine. So he thinks \u201cIdk why the oven would work at all if the fuse is bad\u201d. \n\nToday: I made rocky road brownies. I used the convection bake setting since the oven is still messed up. The oven was set to 350. The brownies needed 25-29 minutes of baking so I set it for 25, thinking that the convection would speed up the baking process. I then went to pull it out and noticed that the top looked done but the brownies were still liquidy/battery when I moved the pan. So I set it for another 10 minutes thinking it wasn\u2019t gonna set up that fast in 5 minutes if I decided to do the full 29 minutes that the book said. I went and checked again after 10 minutes, the tip still looked done so I pulled them out and did a test (sticking a toothpick in the middle to see if it comes out clean) and it didn\u2019t. So I set it back in for 10 minutes and went and told my parents I set it for another 10. That\u2019s when they said that some brownies are meant to be gooey and then asked what flavor they were, and I told them.

{"title": "Advice on cake recipe modifications", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm planning to gift a cake as a version of petit fours as a late Easter treat. I'm using a recipe from Claire Saffitz (in NYT Cooking) which I've already done twice before and came out perfectly. I'm asking for some advice and potential results you might expect if I make some modifications.\n\nThis is the base recipe for a versatile sponge cake:  \n4 eggs  \n100g sugar  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1/4 tsp cream of tartar (can't ever find this in my country so I skipped it)  \n50g veg oil  \n85g cake flour  \n2 tsp vanilla\n\n(160\u00baC 25-30' for a roll, 30-35' for a 9inch round pan)\n\nSo I've done this before for a vanilla sponge + whipped chocolate ganache yule log combo and it's perfect.\n\nHere's what I came up with and what I'd like to accomplish: a caramel cake cut in square (maybe two-bite) pieces, possibly with a mini sp\u00e9culoos cookie on top. In general, I don't want it to be too sweet and in terms of a petit four style, I want to avoid a glaze (fondant or otherwise). From my research, thinking about the easiest assembly, my best option might be a caramel buttercream, so I also thought about mixing in sp\u00e9culoos cookie crumbs to make it a bit more special. My go-to buttercream/frosting is ermine. I find it the easiest to make and not as sweet.  \nPicture this from top to bottom (wish I could draw):   \n\u00b7 dollop of buttercream, piped with a star tip and mini cookie on top - cupcake style.  \n\u00b7 layer of sponge cake.  \n\u00b7 layer of caramel buttercream with cookie crumbs in it.  \n\u00b7 layer of sponge cake.\n\nMy questions:  \n1. Instead of vanilla sponge cake, could I substitute the white sugar with brown, specifically panela, for flavor? Since it's not a butter cake, would the change affect the structure that much?  \n2. I've seen caramel sauce at the store with ingredients: glucose syrup, sugar, water, and conservative E-202. Would adding 2 tsp of this caramel instead of vanilla extract to the cake batter improve anything?   \n3. Is that caramel any good in general and/or could it balance the structure if I sub for panela (because of the glucose), in case it does affect it?  \n4. Thoughts on store caramel vs Caramel sauce (with cream and butter, which would add to my grocery list and expenses) in the buttercream?\n\nI wish I had money and time to test all combinations. Any other ideas are welcome.

My meringue came out perfectly, but the chocolate filling refused to set.\n\nThis is the recipe used for the filling:\n- 1 cup sugar\n- 4 tbsp heaping cocoa powder\n- 4 tbsp (level) corn starch\n- pinch salt (< 1 tsp)\n- 1.5 cup 2% milk\n- 4 egg yolks\n- 1 tsp vanilla\n- 1/4 cup chocolate chips\n- 1/4 cup butter\n\nI combined the dry ingredients in my pot, and beat the yolks in a separate bowl. Then I added the milk to the pot, whisked and started heating until bubbling while stirring constantly. I made sure it was at the bubbling stage for at least a full minute before reducing the heat and tempering the eggs, then added the eggs in. After combining the eggs, I added the butter, chocolate, and vanilla. Combined into the mixture while keeping on medium heat.

I did make a mistake and took it out after only 10 minutes because the meringue was browning already, and let it sit on the counter for about 30min while I figured out what to do to prevent burning. I then reheated the oven and put it back in for an additional session of the full 20min at 375 while covered by tin foil to protect the meringue.\n\nI let it cool on the counter for an hour or two, then into the fridge for 12h while covered. When I took it out of the fridge, it was soup.\n\nMy questions:\n1- Is there any way to save it?\n\n2- If I start over, apart from doing the full bake time the first time, what might have caused problems?

I make an 80%-hydration 100%-whole-wheat sandwich loaf twice a week, the old mixer usually gets the job done somewhere between ten and twenty-five minutes. After calibrating the bowl height with the dime test twice to make sure I had it right, I followed the mixer directions and put the dough hook on and set the mixer to Speed 2 to work on my dough. It stirred it for over half an hour before I gave up and jammed the speed up to like 6 or 7 until it finally came together into a shaggy ball.\n\nOkay, fine, so maybe it needs some more work with a paddle first until the gluten works up a bit? Today I set it up and when the knead came, I put on the mixing paddle and let it go. After two minutes, some of the dough was in a clump on the center of the paddle and the larger part of the dough was all along the bowl, just out of paddle reach (so much for the 'dime test'). So I swapped out for the dough hook and let it go on Speed 2 only and this time it took over an hour to come together. An hour to knead dough following directions? My recipe uses warmed liquid, letting the dough sit in the mixer for an hour is jacking up my timeline and messing up my proves, today's loaf tore out something awful from underproving.\n\nSo, what the hell, right? I went to Kitchenaid's support portal and read some articles. From https://www.kitchenaid.ca/en_ca/blog/o/tips-for-making-bread-stand-mixer.html\n\n>Mix bread dough for no more than 2 minutes and then, depending on the recipe, knead for 2\u20134 minutes. Make sure you avoid over-kneading by adapting the hand-kneading time required in your favourite recipes.\n\n>2 minutes might not seem like a lot of time compared to hand-kneaded dough, but a KitchenAid\u00ae mixer is meant to alleviate some of the work, reduce the time and increase your efficiency when you knead bread dough.\n\n>...\n\n>A perfectly kneaded dough should form into a ball and clean the sides of the bowl. Remember, though, that this is dependent on if your ingredients were properly measured and mixed.\n\n...huh? It should be getting the job done in *six minutes*? \"It only takes this long to knead bread dough and if it takes longer, it means you screwed up your measures.\" That's like telling me that the axe I bought doesn't chop wood because I'm chopping the wrong kind. No, mixer, *I* choose what I'm kneading and *you* do the job, but I can see that Kitchenaid is going to be heavily invested in telling me its my fault. And it's about that time that I realize: Kitchenaid's position is that any malfunction of the product is due to user error or faulty equipment, *they can never admit that their product is underpowered* as I now suspect it is. I refuse to get involved in a game of shipping a mixer back and forth to a repair facility (which is just not having a mixer with extra steps) when they can never make it do the thing I need it to while also being completely unable to admit to me that it never will. \n\nSo I can't trust Kitchenaid to tell me a true answer to what I now ask you: are Kitchenaid mixers legitimately functional via some method as yet unknown to me or is it an underpowered consumer model that only pretends to be capable equipment because most home users won't use it to make bread? I don't want to go back to the old one, I actually need the larger capacity, but one hour to knead dough is completely unacceptable. Has anyone else had an experience with a KA bowl-lift where it seemed to work normally but was actually malfunctioning and was actually capable after replacement?\n\nI am one more bad loaf away from returning this thing to where I bought it for a refund.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1k4mdtj/are_kitchenaid_mixers_just_underpowered/", "created_utc": 1745263992.0, "score": 0, "author": "Hemisemidemiurge", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/AskBaking/comments/1k4mdtj/are_kitchenaid_mixers_just_underpowered/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Why did my brioche not rise?", "selftext": "Yesterday I made two brioches for easter as I have done for the last four years or so. This time, I was using a different (and generally much better) oven. When I put the first one in, it still looked kinda raw after 20 minutes, but it usually should have been done at that point. There was next to no raise and no browning. I turned the temperature up from 180 C to 200 C and then very soon down to 190 C because I thought 200 would be too hot. It started to brown quite quickly and looked done after another 5 - 8 minutes or so but still, next to no rise. I baked the second one (which was half the size) at 190 C and it basically behaved exactly as it should, browned nicely and rose the way it had always done.\n\nI made both loaves basically the same (although I'm not too precise so there could be some general variation), in two batches.

The cream cheese spread I used was the heavy fat version (doppelrahm frischk\u00e4se for the German speakers here). Because I read that it's a bit thicker than the regular version and should give me better consistency, but didn't really work. \n\nCan someone suggest me what to use to make cream cheese frosting when I can't find the block style cream cheese? \n\nIf it's important - I want to try making [Sally's lemon layer cake with cream cheese frosting from this recipe ](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-cake/#tasty-recipes-66829)\n\nThank you in advance!

{"title": "Getting more cake pans", "selftext": "Hello, I started baking a couple months ago and I have wanted to get better at decorating and making cakes as I enjoy it. I've been using some 9x2\" fat daddio pans and they've been nice, but it's a lot of cake and I want to take it down to 6\" pans to try and make taller cakes too for more room. The issue is, even after looking things up and looking on this subreddit, I'm not too sure on some things so I thought I'd ask. I'm good at math too so if you need to use it to explain anything, I'm good with it.\n\nSo first off, 2\" or 3\" sides on the cake pans? Would it hurt getting the 3\" over the 2\"? Looking at a lot of conversion charts and doing some math, if I had a 2 9x2\" cake recipe, and using 3 6x3\" pans, h\\*pi\\*r\\^2 for volume shows that these are equal in volume, or for surface area, 2 9x2\" is \\~127 and 3 6x3\" is \\~84, or exactly a ratio of 1.5. So if I'm thinking about this correctly, I could reduce the 9x2\" recipe by 1.5x and have the perfect amount of batter for the 6\" pans (Of course I would overshoot some). I've seen some people say that you can half 8x2\" recipe's for 3 6x3\" pans and have enough. This all is with the idea that I actually get 3\" instead of 2\". Also, how would this affect cooking times? I've seen people say to \"watch and check\" the cakes as they cook, but as an amateur, is there anything else I can watch, look, or prep for in that regard?\n\nFor reference, I'm planning on making a lemon cake with raspberry frosting probably from this recipe (https://preppykitchen.com/lemon-cake/#recipe) which is a 8x2\" recipe, but I will definitely be making more cakes from 9x2\" recipes as well so I'd like some clarification.
