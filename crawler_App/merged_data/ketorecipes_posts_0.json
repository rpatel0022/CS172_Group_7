{"title": "3 super easy meal preps you can make in 1 hour with only 10 ingredients for $40", "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI wanted to share my 3 meal preps from this week! You should be able to make all the recipes in about an hour of work and get 7 breakfasts and 10-12 lunches/dinners.\n\n**Recipes:**\n\n1. Meal prepped sausage & veggies + eggs\n2. Sheet pan chicken fajitas\n3. Philly cheese steak\n\nI\u2019ve broken down the recipes and I have a grocery list for you at the end with all the ingredients. I typically prep 1-2lbs of meat at a time and eat 5-6oz portion, so feel free to adjust/scale accordingly.\n\nI\u2019ve got a massive list of 40+[ keto meal prep recipes](https://www.pfgeeks.com/easy-keto-meal-prep-recipes/) on my own blog, but I thought I\u2019d share 3 of my favorite & easiest ones in this post.\n\n**1. Meal prepped sausage & veggies + eggs**\n\n* Roughly chop 2 cups mushrooms, 1 green bell pepper, and half an onion\n* Saute in pan for 10 minutes or so with some oil until it starts to brown. A bit of chicken broth can be used if trying to limit your fats, but this is keto, so oil them up.\n* Add 1lb sausage (turkey, pork, venison) and cook until browned. Salt & pepper to taste.\n\nEvery morning, heat up your pan, drop a scoop of this goodness in and crack some eggs over it. Scramble it up. Takes about 5 minutes to cook each morning. Add cheese if you want.\n\nYou could also make this into an egg casserole or egg muffins if you wanted them to be 100% meal prepped.\n\nEst. price: $1.20/serving\n\n**2. Sheet pan chicken fajitas**\n\n* Put 2lbs chicken breast or thighs into a ziploc or bowl. Dump in your marinade of choice. I just buy some from the store to make it easy and save time. Add a tablespoon of soy sauce in for extra goodness. Marinade for 30 minutes to an hour.\n* Slice 1 green bell, 1 red bell, and 3/4 onion\n* Cover sheetpan with foil and dump the bell peppers & chicken on it.\n* Cook for 20 minutes at 350 or so and check to make sure it\u2019s done.\n\nEst. price: $2-3/serving\n\n**3. Philly Cheese Steak Filling**\n\nEveryone has an opinion on how philly cheese steak sandwiches are meant to be done\u2026 but my alternate name was sliced steak with cheese. Eat it and enjoy it.\n\n* Saute 2-3 cups of sliced mushrooms, 1-2 sliced bell peppers, 3/4 sliced onion until caramelized. Salt, pepper, garlic, and a bit of cayenne to season it.\n* Take veggies out of pan\n* Thinly slice your steak of choice (round, rump, ribeye if you\u2019re rich). Add to the hot pan and flip after 2 minutes each side. Goal is to basically sear it. Season the meat beforehand with salt and pepper.\n* Add veggies back in\n* Mix it all up and cook on low for 5-10 minutes\n* When it comes time to eat, add whatever cheese you want on top and heat it up.\n\nEst. price: $3-5/serving depending on steak cut\n\n**Grocery list**\n\n* 2lbs Chicken\n* 2lbs steak\n* 1lb sausage (pork, turkey)\n* 1 dozen eggs or whites\n* 3-4 green bell peppers\n* 2 onions\n* A big thing of sliced mushrooms\n* Fajita marinade\n* Salt, pepper, garlic powder\n* Favorite shredded cheese\n\nThe great thing about these recipes is that they share a lot of ingredients but are cooked different ways.\n\nHope this helps y\u2019all out!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/ac9q6o/3_super_easy_meal_preps_you_can_make_in_1_hour/", "created_utc": 1546546785.0, "score": 1426, "author": "richhoward1993", "num_comments": 70, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/ac9q6o/3_super_easy_meal_preps_you_can_make_in_1_hour/", "html_title": ""}

The picture doesn't make it look great, I know, lol.\n\nI dictated my process into ChatGPT and it spit out a very accurate recipe! Thought I'd share.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nCreamy Gochujang Beef with Stewed Tomato & Pepper Sauce\n\nA rich, deeply flavorful keto dish born from a spontaneous fridge dive and finished with garden-fresh cilantro and silky avocado.\n\n\n---\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 lb ground beef\n\n2 red bell peppers, diced\n\n\u00bd large white onion, diced\n\n4 small vine-on tomatoes, left whole\n\n2 tbsp gochujang seasoning (adjust to taste)\n\n2 cloves of garlic, minced\n\n1 tbsp butter\n\n1 splash heavy cream (roughly 1\u20132 tbsp)\n\nSalt, to taste\n\n1 ripe avocado, sliced (for topping)\n\nFresh cilantro, for garnish\n\n\n\n---\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Brown the Beef:\nIn a large wok over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef. Once cooked, remove the beef to a bowl and salt it while resting, leaving the rendered fat in the wok.\n\n\n2. Saut\u00e9 the Veggies:\nAdd onion to the beef fat and saut\u00e9 until soft. Add the garlic and stir briefly. Then add the red peppers and saut\u00e9 until they begin to soften.\n\n\n3. Stew the Tomatoes:\nPlace whole, vine-on tomatoes directly on top of the veggie mixture. Let them stew untouched until they soften enough to press open slightly. Remove the vines, flip the tomatoes, and continue cooking until they can be easily smashed with your spatula.\n\n\n4. Blend the Base:\nSmash the tomatoes into the mixture and stir well. Once everything is softened and juicy, use an immersion blender to blend briefly\u2014just enough to create a thick, cohesive sauce (not fully pureed).\n\n\n5. Enrich the Sauce:\nAdd a small splash of heavy cream and stir gently. Then slowly melt in the butter, stirring to incorporate until glossy and slightly thickened.\n\n\n6. Bring Back the Beef:\nReturn the browned beef to the wok, stir to combine, and let it cook together for a few more minutes.\n\n\n7. Serve:\nSpoon into bowls and top with sliced avocado and a generous handful of fresh cilantro.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nIf it still tastes a bit too tangy, add more salt. This combined with simmering will balance and deepen the flavors!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbp0m5", "created_utc": 1746041080.0, "score": 8, "author": "mineofgod", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1kbp0m5/gochujang_beef_with_red_pepper_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

To make it fit his diet, I left out the potatoes and replaced the b\u00e9chamel with cream... it's delicious! \n\n Sorry if there are any mistakes, I used chat gpt to translate my recipe\n\n\n**Ingredients for a medium-sized dish (6 servings) :**\n\n*\u2022 For the vegetables :*\n\n-3 eggplants\n-2 zucchinis (zucchini is optional in traditional Greek moussaka)\n\n-Vegetable oil (if you fry \u2013 traditional method) or olive oil (or any vegetable oil of your choice) if you prefer baking in the oven, using an air fryer, or saut\u00e9ing in a pan (a lighter version. According to my research, even in Greece, many families do it this way now).\n\n\n*\u2022 For the meat sauce :*\n\n-400g ground meat (traditionally lamb, but I always use beef)\n-1 finely chopped onion\n-1 garlic clove\n-3 tbsp olive oil\n-400g crushed tomatoes\n-1 tbsp tomato paste\n-1 bay leaf\n-A pinch of cinnamon powder\n-A pinch of grated nutmeg\n-Optional: clove\n-Salt and pepper to taste (I use about \u00be or 1 level tsp of salt and half a tsp of pepper)\n\n\n*\u2022 For assembling :*\n\n-Fried or roasted vegetables\n-Meat sauce\n-Hard salty cheese \n*(choose from: kefalograviera, graviera, kefalotyri, or parmigiano reggiano, pecorino romano, or grana padano)*, about 100g in total *(adjust to your taste)*\n-500g cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\n*(I use French thick cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, 30% fat. If unavailable, I guess you could mix sour cream with heavy cream)*\n-Optional: 1 egg yolk\n\n\n*\u2022 Preparing the vegetables :*\n\n-Slice the washed eggplants and zucchinis into rounds the thickness of a pinky finger (about 0.5\u20131 cm).\n\n-Salt and let them sit in a colander for 30 min to draw out moisture. Pat them dry with paper towels.\n\n*\u2022 Frying version :*\n\n-Heat enough oil for frying. The oil should be hot but not boiling. \nAdd the slices (enough to fill the pan without overcrowding for even cooking).\n\n-Flip halfway through. Remove them before they turn golden, once they become tender.\n\n-Drain on paper towels and use another layer to soak up excess oil.\n\n-Repeat until all veggies are cooked. Use two pans if you can\u2014it speeds things up.\n\n-Do the same with the zucchini.\n\n*\u2022 Oven version :*\n\n-Use a pastry brush to apply a thin layer of oil to both sides of the slices.\nI use about 5 tbsp of oil in total.\n\nBaking time depends on your oven. As a guide: ~15 minutes at 390\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n\nDon\u2019t open the oven too early. Avoid overbaking or drying them out.\n\n\n*\u2022 Making the meat sauce :*\n\nTip for stainless steel pans : heat the pan empty until a drop of water dances across the surface.\n Remove from heat, add oil, then return to heat.\n\n-Add chopped onion, saut\u00e9 over medium-low heat for ~8 min. Add chopped garlic.\n\n-After 2 more minutes, turn up the heat and brown the meat. Add a little salt. \nBreak it up with a wooden spatula until browned and sizzling.\n\n-Add the remaining sauce ingredients. \nAdd a small glass of water if needed. \nLet simmer on low heat for 30 min until thickened.\n Taste and adjust seasoning.\n\n\n\n*\u2022 Cream mixture :*\n\n-Add a pinch of pepper and nutmeg to the cream, and half the cheese.\n\n-(Optional: mix in 1 egg yolk.)\n\n-Taste and add salt if needed (remember the cheese is salty).\n\n\n\n*\u2022 Assembly :*\n\n-In a baking dish, start with a layer of zucchini.\n\n-Add a layer of eggplant (half of them).\n\n-Stir 1 big spoon of the cream into the meat sauce, plus a bit of cheese if you like.\n\n-Pour all the meat sauce over the eggplants. Spread evenly.\n\n-Add the remaining eggplants, then the cream mixture.\n\n-Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake in a preheated oven at 390\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 30\u201345 min (or about 1h at 355\u00b0F / 180\u00b0C), depending on your oven, vegetable thickness, etc.\n\n-Cover with foil if it browns too fast.\n\n-Once done, let rest for 15 min before serving with a fresh salad.\n\n\n**Nutrition per portion (1/6 of the dish)\n(based on the full original recipe, baked version, no egg yolk)**\n**\u2022 Calories: ~725 kcal ; Net carbs: ~18.1 g (~10%) ; Protein: ~28.9 g (~15%) ; Fat: ~61.9 g (~75%)**\n\n*\u2022 Low-Carb Adjustments (Optional) :*\n\n*\u2022 Use only 2 eggplants instead of 3*\n*\u2022 Omit the zucchini*\n*\u2022 Use 300g crushed tomatoes + 30g tomato paste instead of 400g + 50g*\n*\u2022 Replace the onion with a small shallot or use only 30g onion*\n*\u2022 Avoid adding sugar or starchy veggies anywhere else*\n\n\n*Since there are fewer vegetables, you can use a slightly smaller dish, space the eggplant slices a little, or simply make one layer of eggplant, followed by the meat sauce, then cream and cheese...*\n\n*With these changes, you can bring it down to ~12\u201313g net carbs per portion*\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juenvc", "created_utc": 1744121871.0, "score": 193, "author": "debbiefrench____", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1juenvc/keto_greek_moussaka/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Crumbling Cake: Cottage Cheese Lemon Cake", "selftext": "Hi! I could use some advice about baking with almond flour or feedback about this recipe in general. I made a Cottage Cheese Lemon cake in an 8\" springform pan. I used 1 cup cottage cheese, 1/2 cup greek yogurt, 1 whole lemon with a few table spoons extra lemon juice from 1/2 lemon,  4 eggs, 3/4 cup (170gm) Ghee, 1 + 3/4 cup Erythritol. I whizzed it all in a food processor until it had a creamy consistency with no big lemon chunks. Then I added 1 +1/2 cups of Almond flour and whizzed up again until it looked like a good batter consistency.  I baked at 365 F for about 50 minutes and it looked great.

I think I will first go and see if I can get spicy ramen powder so that I can try out some ramen again, as these noodles would be amazing in it!\n\nPlease help me in my quest for saucy happiness!\n\n*****\nFor those who are not familiar with Black Tie Kitchen's pasta, here is the link: https://www.blacktiekitchen.com/recipes/keto-pasta-noodles\n\nAnd here is the recipe, directly from his site:\n\nIngredients\n\n    \u00bd cup (80g) Vital Wheat Gluten\n    \u00bd cup (80g) White Lupin Flour\n    2 large eggs\n    Oat Fiber (optional)\n\nHardware\n\n    Pasta Machine\n    Rolling pin\n\nInstructions\n\n    Combine the wheat gluten and lupin flower either by hand or in a food processor.\n    Add the 2 eggs and mix. If the dough is too dry, add a few drops of water.\n    Sprinkle some oat fiber or lupin flour on your surface and knead the dough until it is consistent and slightly smooth but also stretchy.\n    Cover with plastic wrap and let rest on the counter at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.\n    Cut the ball into 4 and roll out into a disc.\n    Using a pasta machine (or a rolling pin), roll our the dough until it gets to your the thinnest you can get it without it falling apart.\n    Cut your dough to your desired size (typically 12-16 inches for standard noodle length).\n\n\nTo Cook:\n\n    Bring a pot of water to a boil and heavily salt - it should taste like sea water.\n    Cook the noodles for 3 minutes exactly. No more, no less. Trust me - 3 minutes is the perfect time.\n    Remove and use in whatever you want to use. Ive cooked noodles and eaten them the next day as leftovers =)\n    Enjoy!\n\nNotes\n\n3 minutes in boiling water. I'm not kidding when I say no more and no less!\n\nEach serving has 2.7g carbs.\n\nI ate 2 servings for a little over 5 carbs.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1j4ahp8/i_am_seeking_recipes_ideas_for_ketofriendly/", "created_utc": 1741200383.0, "score": 31, "author": "SaintCharlie", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1j4ahp8/i_am_seeking_recipes_ideas_for_ketofriendly/", "html_title": ""}

Remember everyone's bodies are different, you may want to adjust the carb intakes of the recipe a bit, but I had no problem with it for 6 months.\n\nIt's a chocolate blend of nuts and some grains that works well for me. While maintaining a below 30-50 grams of carbs a day. You could in theory adjust the flavor or mixture to your own personal preference, but I just really think it's perfect the way it is, even if it may take a bit of getting used to. It might be a bit chunky if you're not using a high grade blender, it needs to be something that can actually blend seeds into dust.\n\n# Recipe\n\n* 1 Cup of Sugar Free Almond Milk & Water (or just 2 Cups of Sugar Free, Almond Milk)\n* 2 Scoops of Whey Protein (I prefer a heavy chocolate flavor)\n\n>Alternatively you could use a flavorless version and just add in a bit of Cocoa Powder.\n\n* 1 Scoop of Creatine (Optional)\n* 2TBPS Hemp Hearts\n* 2TBPS Wheat Germ\n* 1TBSP Chia Seed\n* 3-4 Almonds\n* 1TBS Flax Seeds\n* 1TBS Pumpkin Seeds\n* 1TBS Sunflower Seeds\n* 1TSP Ground Ginger\n* 1TSP Salt\n\n>You can add in some extra ingredients like Kale and Spinach.

{"title": "Fried Chicken Technique I Just Invented", "selftext": "So I was testing out a few different ways to bread chicken for making a keto General Tso's, because it's my favorite (non)Chinese take-out.  This can obvi work for pretty much any kind of chicken.  \n  \nI was testing different ways to bread the chicken; just rolled in almond flour, just rolled in ground pork-rind breading, almond flour then egg/cream wash then breaded, and mayonnaise then breaded.  They all lost some of the breading in the oil, and the egg/cream and mayo clouded up the oil so I knew some was dissolving off.  \n  \nI think I hit on something special.  \n  \nIngredients  \nEggs  \nAlmond Flour  \nGround pork rinds  \n  \nA roughly 1:1:2 ratio of ground pork-rinds, almond flour, and eggs to make a batter.  Equal parts pork rinds/flour, then add eggs till the batter seems to be a proper consistency.  I'm going to test more to get proper weights, but it was roughly the same by mass eyeball wise (i.e. more egg weight than breading).  Dunk the chicken in the batter, drop in the hot oil (the batter will come off on your hands, so I used chopsticks to dunk and drop).  Pull out of the oil and put on paper towels once the batter has firmed up, let cool while doing more pieces or a batch.  Then refry, drain on paper towels again, and finally refry a third time until a nice deep golden brown.  \n  \nPulling it out and letting it cool helps the moisture fry out of the very egg-heavy batter without overcooking the chicken, and it ends up being a texture that's almost exactly what I would get when I used to do traditional General Tso's.  Going just once the batter was wet and floppy, and leaving it in till the proper color the chicken was overdone.  I was doing this with thigh meat, so you might want to only go twice with white meat.

Gently, drop in the cubes of paneer and gently toss, taking care not to break the cubes if you're using the homemade kind. Let the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped.\n* Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food processor until smooth. Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife.\n* Place a large skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so, and then remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate (optional - but do this if your paneer is crumbly).\n* Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and chile. Now here's the important part: saute the mixture until it's evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes. Don't skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water.\n* Add the garam masala, coriander and cumin. If you haven't already, sprinkle a little water to keep the spices from burning. Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cook out, and it all smells a bit more melodious, 3 to 5 minutes.\n* Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. Add a little salt and 1/2 cup of water, stir, and cook about 5 minutes with the lid off.\n* Turn the heat off. Add the yogurt, a little at a time to keep it from curdling. Once the yogurt is well mixed into the spinach, add the paneer. Turn the heat back on, cover and cook until everything is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNotes:\n\n* I typically make a double batch and use 3 serrano peppers with seeds because I enjoy spicy foods.\n* Pairs well with chicken, and flavorful enough to make even plain chicken breast tasty. Also good on its own as a main dish.\n* I once forgot to remove the paneer from the pan when I put in the onions and it all seemed fine, but maybe it's important if your paneer isn't firm.\n* If you're in Seattle, Apel Farms makes great paneer.

I will eat some low carb stuff but really fatty foods upset my stomach and pork is not on my diet \u2721\ufe0f and most dairy and me don't get along.\n\nHere's the issue with some turkey bacon, most of them add canola oil or other oils into the bacon itself and most also add sugar.\n\nI buy brands like Godshall at the box stores which is uncured and has no added oils or sugar. \n\nHere's the issue with bacon that has no oils added into the bacon:\n\nIf you fry them the way the package says to fry them, they don't get crispy they will turn black and get hard and taste gross.\n\nHere's my little trick to get uncured, no oil or sugar added bacon, thick or thin sliced to get crispy without turning into charcoal. \n\n**The Skillet:**\n\nUse a cast iron skillet or a heavy non-stick skillet that disperses heat evenly so you don't get undercooked pieces.\n\n**Cooking Oil:**\n\nI use avocado oil for this, butter breaks down at higher temperatures due to its lower smoke point. \n\nSpray oil or spread oil on your skillet real good,  give it a good coating but you don't want a big pool of oil.\n\n**Heat:**\n\nUse medium high heat and don't put the bacon in until the skillet is hot.\n\n**Timing:**\n\nI use a pair of tongs and flip them every couple of minutes. \n\nThey will get crispier after you take them out.\n\nIt's better to undercook them and then cook them a little more then to overcook them.\n\n**Reapply Oil:**\n\nBecause turkey bacon is a lot leaner, when it fries it will soak up the oil some and you will need to reapply oil between batches if you are frying like a 12 oz package or 40 ounce package. I fry four at a time and reapply oil each time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe boyfriend will actually eat it If I have it in the fridge and likes the texture that it is similar to \"real bacon\" in his words. \n\nThe only issue with some of the all natural ones that it is so clean with no preservatives and no artificial flavors and so on, it has a tendency to be bland so I have to add a little seasoning to it when frying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1i27rn4/to_get_crispy_turkey_bacon/", "created_utc": 1736975097.0, "score": 2, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1i27rn4/to_get_crispy_turkey_bacon/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Working on a from scratch simple almond flour chips (crisps) recipe", "selftext": "I make my own corn tortillas so I am making almond flour tortillas for the boyfriend. \n\nI thought since I can make my own tostadas, I can make them into corn chips by just adding extra sea salt and seasoning and cutting them into pieces before frying.\n\nI have an 8 inch cast iron tortilla press, aluminum ones are not as sturdy and may not give the pressure needed.\n\nUse parchment paper or wax paper, you can use parchment rounds that are cut to fit.\n\nHere's the base recipe I'm going to be starting with:\n\n* 4 oz / 113 g almond flour \n* 1/2 oz / 14 g psyllium husk\n* 1/4 tsp sea salt \n* 1/2 cup / 118 g water\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together almond flour, psyllium husk and salt.\n\n2. Add water, stir until combined. \n\n3. Rest for 5 minutes. \n\n**The dough should have the consistency of Play-Doh.**\n\nIf too thin add a little bit more almond flour, if too thick add a little bit more water and then let rest some more.\n\n4. Separate into five equal size portions which will give you 6 inch tortillas.\n\nUse smaller amounts of batter for smaller street tacos, 7 balls will give you a little over 4 inch diameter tortillas and 6 balls will give you 5 inch tortillas.\n\nI use a two tablespoon ice cream scoop which will give me roughly 5 inch tortillas.\n\n5. Place one piece of parchment or wax paper on the bottom of the press\n\n6. Take a batter portion and roll into a ball and place in the middle of the tortilla press. \n\n7. Place a parchment or wax paper piece on top of the ball and press down. \n\n8. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat until hot (If using cast iron, spray a little bit of cooking oil on it, not too much) \n\n9. Carefully peel out the tortilla and place in the skillet for 1 minute or so per side.\n\n10. They will be done when it gets a little brown in places. \n\n11. Place on wire rack to cool.\n\n* To reheat, warm in a skillet (do not use oil or it will become crispy)\n\nSo I thought why not make them into tostadas and chips by making them crispy.\n\nSo I've done this with corn tostadas I'm going to try this with almond flour. \n\nHere's the flavors I am going to attempt:\n\nFor all the chips I am going to add extra sea salt\n\n* Traditional \"corn\" chips with almond flour instead.\n* Sea salt and cracked pepper for salt and pepper chips.\n* Ranch seasoning to make it ranch style. \n* Subtract some water and add vinegar and sea salt for sea salt and vinegar chips.\n* Garlic and onion with sea salt.\n\nI'll add the extra seasoning into the batter before putting it in the tortilla press. \n\nHow I plan on frying this: \n\n1. After making the tortillas when they are still warm, cut them into pieces with a pizza wheel.\n\n2. Heat up a skillet with some avocado oil on high until hot. \n\n3. Placing the pieces in the skillet and fry them until they get crispy.\n\n4. Set on paper towels to get excess oil out. \n\n* If it doesn't work with them warm after making the tortillas, I'll let them cool before cutting them. \n\nIf anyone has tried this, let me know.\n\n**I'll post my results of the experiment and how it tastes**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hs3siu/working_on_a_from_scratch_simple_almond_flour/", "created_utc": 1735850320.0, "score": 19, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hs3siu/working_on_a_from_scratch_simple_almond_flour/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Stir in the melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract until the dough comes together.\n* Turn the dough out onto the prepared baking sheet and form into a low, flat log, about 10 x 4 inches. Bake for 25 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool for 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 250\u00baF.\n* With a large serrated knife, gently slice the log into 15 even slices. Place the slices back onto the baking sheet, cut side down, and bake for 15 minutes.\n* Flip each slice carefully and continue to bake for another 15 minutes. Turn off the oven and let them sit inside until cool. Keep your eye on them in case they brown too quickly.\n* In a shallow dish, whisk together the granulated sweetener and cinnamon. Dip the biscotti on both sides in the cinnamon mixture.\n\n# Notes\n\n**Storage Information:**\u00a0Biscotti are baked hard and dry, so they have a longer shelf life than things like keto chocolate chip cookies. You can store them in a covered container on the counter for up to a week. You can also freeze biscotti for several months.If you live in a humid environment, they may soften up as they sit. You can crisp them back up by placing them in a warm (200\u00baF) oven for 15 minutes or so, and letting them cool again.\n\n# Nutrition\n\nServing:\u00a01biscotto\u00a0|\u00a0Calories:\u00a0129kcal\u00a0|\u00a0Carbohydrates:\u00a03.9g\u00a0|\u00a0Protein:\u00a03.9g\u00a0|\u00a0Fat:\u00a011.4g\u00a0|\u00a0Fiber:\u00a01.9g\n\n**By Carolyn Ketchum of All Day I Dream About Food**Keto Biscotti Recipe\n\n\n\n[Cinnamon Keto Biscotti - All Day I Dream About Food](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/cinnamon-keto-biscotti/comment-page-1/?unapproved=296569&moderation-hash=97dad086502c7b1851d63b312dac32f8)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hgrym6/for_all_the_biscotti_lovers_out_there_doing/", "created_utc": 1734490176.0, "score": 45, "author": "aztonyusa", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hgrym6/for_all_the_biscotti_lovers_out_there_doing/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The end result is light, airy, and incredibly delicious. \n\r\nTip: Eggs are easier to separate while they are still chilled. Once separated, reserve the yolks in the refrigerator for another use, if desired, and allow the whites to come to room temperature for at least 30 minutes prior to beating. \r\n\r\nPrep time: 15 minutes \r\nCook time: 2 hours 45 minutes\r\nYields: 65 small cookies (as shown)\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n4 large egg whites, room temperature\r\n\u00bd t. cream of tartar\r\n1/8 t. salt\r\n\u00be c.

{"title": "Bacon and Blue Cheeseburger Stuffed Portobellos ", "selftext": "Bacon and Blue Cheeseburger Stuffed Portobellos \n\r\nThis satisfying low carb entr\u00e9e has all the elements of a classic blue cheeseburger, without the bun! This version may be a bit easier, as well, because you don\u2019t need to form the ground beef into patties before cooking. On the plus side, you don\u2019t have to worry about making sure the burgers fit on the mushroom caps. However, you\u2019ll want to be careful not to overcook the beef with this method. \n\r\nTip: To prepare the mushroom caps, gently remove stems by hand. Then, carefully scoop out the gills with a spoon and discard.

Add the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, if using, and the dried rosemary. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste, and stir to combine. \r\n\r\n5.\tCook over medium heat, breaking up the beef with a wooden spoon while stirring, until the meat is mostly browned, but still a little pink in some places, approximately 3-4 minutes.

{"title": "Asian inspired sauce and soup", "selftext": "Pictured: Hot & Sour Soup fusion made with leftover chicken and leftover vegetables.\n\nLet's stop food waste!\n\n**Post has three recipes.**\n\nEach year we do a different theme for a holiday party.\n\nLast year it was Asian Fusion and I never really made Asian food except for basic stir fry or fried rice.\n\nI discovered it was super easy and even the ones that required specialty ingredients could easily be swapped out.\n\nA lot of them are also super easy to convert to low carbohydrate or sugar-free.\n\nWith ginger powder, don't get the store stuff in the shaker, you can get a 1 lb bag of organic ginger powder. Keep the bag sealed and it will retain its flavor.\n\n**Sweet And Sour Sauce**\n\nIt is simple to whip up and doesn't require any odd ingredients for a simple sweet and sour sauce that can be used as a dipping sauce or even as a glaze.\n\nI modified the recipe using an allulose / stevia blend.\n\nDo not use erythritol, it will crystallize.\n\nI used unsweetened curry ketchup, I've also made this with unsweetened Primal Kitchen Ketchup.\n\nSince I used unsweetened ketchup I added a little bit more sweetener than the recipe calls for. \n\nI mix 1 tsp stevia with 1 cup of allulose as my blend.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 3/4+ cup sugar substitute blend\n* 2/3 cup water\n* 1/3 cup white vinegar \n* 1/4 cup soy sauce\n* 1+ tsp xanthan gum or guar gum\n* 1 tbsp ketchup\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. Take your 3/4 cup sweetener and grind it to a confectioner blend in a coffee grinder or smoothie blender. \n\n2. Add all ingredients to a pot except the thickener. \n\n3. Stir together. \n\n4. Taste and add any additional sweetener.\n\n5. Slowly whisk in xanthan gum \n\n6. Bring to a slow boil and stir constantly until it starts to thicken. \n\n7. If not thick enough, slowly sprinkle and whisk additional xanthan gum. \n\nThat's it.\n\n**Notes**\n\nDoes not work with gelatin \n\nYou can use rice vinegar but it will make it a little bit sweeter tasting.\n\nIt will thicken further as it cools.\n\nStores for roughly a week in the fridge.\n\nIf you want a little bit more kick, you can sprinkle in some ginger powder.\n\nCan add 1 tsp of molasses.\n\nCan add more ketchup If it is too weak.\n\nCan use sweetened ketchup like Heinz Sugar Free Ketchup, just add the recipe amount.\n\n**Egg Drop Soup**\n\nThis is a simple recipe that took just a little tinkering.\n\nIt does not have any hard to source ingredients.\n\nIf you want to make your own garlic salt:\n\n3 parts garlic powder to 1 part salt, I make mine with Himalayan pink salt.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 32 oz chicken broth or chicken bone broth \n* 3 large eggs\n* 1/2 to 1 tsp xanthan or guar gum\n* 1 tsp ground ginger\n* 1/4 tsp garlic salt\n* 1/8 to 1/4 tsp black pepper (I use 1/4 tsp) \n* 3 green onions (thin sliced)\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. Whisk eggs and set aside\n\n2. In a pot, add chicken broth and slowly whisk in xanthan gum. \n\n3. Add ground ginger, garlic salt, black pepper.\n\n4. If too thin, slowly whisk in more xanthan gum.\n\n5. Bring to a boil while stirring and add green onions and continue stirring.\n\n6. Bring to a roaring boil.\n\n7. Use a non slotted spoon, stir the soup in clockwise or counterclockwise circles, do not change the stirring direction.\n\n8. While stirring in circles, slowly add the eggs. The eggs will cook while you are stirring.\n\n9. Turn off the heat and enjoy, don't overcook the eggs.\n\n**Notes**\n\nCan add additional vegetables or protein, after step 2, add your ingredients and let it simmer until the vegetables or protein get to desired tenderness.\n\nTop with additional green onion.\n\nI like to add a little bit of fresh ginger slivers into the soup when I add the green onion.\n\n**Hot And Sour Soup**\n\nThis is another simple soup that I like to make when I have leftover vegetables or leftover meat and I want to avoid food waste.\n\nBecause I throw in leftover vegetables it's not traditional. \n\nI will include a traditional recipe and then you can add or subtract whatever to your taste.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 64 oz chicken or vegetable broth (or bone broth)\n* 8 oz shiitake mushrooms thinly sliced\n* 8 oz can bamboo shoots (drained) \n* 1/4+ cup rice wine vinegar \n* 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce \n* 2+ tsp ground ginger \n* 1+ tsp chilli garlic sauce\n* 1+ tsp xanthan or guar gum \n* 2 large eggs (whisked) \n* 8 oz firm tofu cut into 1/2 inch cubes\n* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil \n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Ingredient substitution**\n\n* Can use baby bella mushrooms for shiitake mushrooms.\n* Can use white vinegar for rice vinegar but it will make it a little more sour. \n* Can use regular soy sauce but will make it more saltier.\n* Can use Sriracha sauce or red pepper flakes and minced garlic instead of chili garlic sauce \n* Can use extra firm tofu \n* Can substitute avocado oil or peanut oil for toasted sesame oil\n* Can add a little tahini or a bagel seasoning with the avocado or peanut oil.\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. In a large stock pot, sprinkle in and whisk xanthan gum with 64 oz broth.\n\n2. Add mushrooms, bamboo shoots, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and chili garlic sauce.\n\n3. Heat over medium high heat while stirring until it reaches a simmer. \n\n4. If too thin, sprinkle and whisk more xanthan gum. Stir soup in a circular motion.\n\n5. Continue stirring the soup in a circular motion, then drizzle in the eggs in a thin stream (while still stirring the soup) to create egg ribbons.\n\n6. Stir in the tofu, sesame oil and half of the green onions.\n\n7. Add additional salt and pepper for taste. \n\n8. If you\u2019d like a more \u201csour\u201d soup, add in another tablespoon or two of rice wine vinegar as well.\n\n9.  If you like a spicier soup, add in more chili garlic sauce.\n\n10. Garnish with additional green onions and serve immediately. \n\nCan eat as is or serve on cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nWhat I added to the soup in the picture: \n\n* Was out of bamboo shoots so it was omitted. \n* Used regular white mushrooms. \n* Since I'm sick, I wanted it very spicy. I used red pepper flakes, cayenne powder and jarred minced garlic in water (drained).\n* Used 2 tbsp ginger powder.\n* I used dark soy sauce.\n* Used 1 tsp avocado oil + 1 tsp bagel seasoning.\n* Used fresh vegetables that I had in the fridge. \n* Used leftover chicken breast.\n\nServed on cauliflower rice.\n\n**How to add fresh vegetables**\n\nAfter I added the 64 oz of chicken stock and whisked in the xanthan gum, I added my fresh vegetables\n\nI let it simmer for an hour until the vegetables were al dente.\n\nAfter that I continued with step 2.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/9bfdn9iq0x5e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1733790309.0, "score": 18, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1haow9p/asian_inspired_sauce_and_soup/", "html_title": ""}

Add water to percolator \n2. Add coffee and pumpkin pie spice to the basket \n3. Brew and add a few minutes of brewing time to make it extra strong. \n4. After brewing, add coffee, vanilla extract, milk, sweetener and pumpkin puree to a pot.\n5. Heat on medium and stir until dissolved. \n\nIf you're not using a percolator: \n\n1. Brew coffee like you normally would, use a little bit extra coffee when brewing because you want this strong. \n\n2. Follow the instructions above but add the pumpkin pie spice to the pot along with the other ingredients.\n\n3. You'll need to stir more so that the pumpkin pie spice does not become grainy.\n\nPour and enjoy!\n\nFor an extra treat:\n\n1.After making your pumpkin spice latte, instead of pouring into cups, cover and simmer to keep warm. \n2. Whisk together heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. \n3. Pour the coffee into cups, top with the homemade whipped topping. Dust it with a little bit of cinnamon or nutmeg or pumpkin spice. \n\nEnjoy! \n\n**Chocolate mint latte**\n\nBe careful with this one because a little mint extract tastes good but too much and it overpowers it and it becomes sickening mint so use a few drops at a time!\n\nI also do this in a percolator since I use unsweetened cocoa powder which can be very grainy if not done correctly.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nCoffee:\n\n* 24 oz (750 ml) brewed strong coffee\n* Peppermint extract **do not use more than 1/4 tsp**\n* 3 to 4 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n* 2+ cups (1/2+ liter) dairy or non-dairy milk (I mix almond milk with some heavy whipping cream) \n* Sweetener of choice\n\nOptional topping: \n\n* 1 cup (237 ml)l heavy whipping cream \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n* 2 tbsp sweetener \n* Sugar-free starlight mints\n\n**Preparation**\n\nIf using a percolator:\n\n1. Add water and mint extract to the percolator, I use 1/4 tsp of mint extract.\n2. Add ground coffee and cocoa powder to the basket. \n3. Give it a few minutes extra brewing time to make it stronger. \n4. In a pot, add brewed coffee milk and sweetener, stir, put it on medium until it gets to the right temperature you want. \n\nIf you're not using a percolator: \n\n1. Brew coffee as you normally would, you might have to add extra coffee because you want it strong.\n2. In a pot, add brewed coffee, milk, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, sweetener and mint extract **add a couple of drops at a time, It will easily overpower it !!**\n3. Set stove to medium and stir (You're going to have to stir and stir and stir so that the cocoa powder is not grainy).\n\nPour and enjoy!\n\nOr you can add the topping:\n\nInstead of buying expensive shredded sugar-free mints, I take a few starlight mints, put them under some plastic wrap and smash them with a hammer until they have turned into powder.\n\n1. Whisk together heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. \n2. Pour into cups and top with the whip topping.\n3. Dust with the powdered starlight mints.\n\nPour and enjoy!\n\n**About percolators**\n\nThe difference between a percolator and a drip coffee maker like what you have at work is a percolator reruns the water through the coffee grinds over and over again. \n\nIt can go from strong to bitter or burnt easily if you are not careful. \n\nBecause it cycles it over and over and over again it makes for a stronger cup and can extract out the pumpkin pie spice and cocoa powder without the graininess. \n\nI use a 12 cup percolator and this is how I set it. \n\nFor 24 oz / 750 ml I use 6 tbsp ground coffee (not using exact weight because whole bean coffee weight varies).\n\nUse a medium grind coffee.\n\nI would recommend using a disc filter that goes into the percolator basket that will help with coffee grinds, you could also just punch a hole in a regular basket filter (that's what I do).\n\nWhen you're ready to brew, put it on your stove on high, as soon as coffee starts gurgling into the clear dome on the top, reduce heat to halfway between low and medium I do mine at 3.\n\nHere's the trick, you want it to percolate and still see coffee coming up into the dome but you don't want it boiling but you don't want it so low that it stops percolating. \n\nSo after you reduce the heat that's when your brewing time starts, I do it for about 10 minutes, some people want it a little bit lighter  and use less time and some people want it super strong almost like tar and do it for as much as 15 minutes.\n\nIf you are using dark roast coffee, It will take a little less time.\n\nLight roast or blond roast is not recommended.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/581xkqyigo3e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1732814958.0, "score": 11, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1h213a2/pumpkin_spice_lattee_chocolate_mint_latte/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Just started making my own cauliflower rice + food storage tips", "selftext": "The box stores have gone up in price for cauliflower rice big time.\n\nOne of our stores, Winn-Dixie has been having cauliflower BOGO. \n\nIt's now cheaper to do it yourself than buying it. I get roughly 6 lb / 2.72 kg for $3.49 USD.\n\nHere's the method that I use, I combined a couple of them to what works for me. \n\n1. Wash and pat dry a head of cauliflower.\n2. Set it somewhere to let dry for a couple hours. \n3. Cut off the end and the dark green leaves. \n4.. Cut it into quarters or manageable chunks. \n5. Either use a box grater (see images) or a food processor with a shredder blade that's used for coleslaw (I use the shredder blade)\n6. Shred your cauliflower into rice (I use as much of the stalk as possible, see notes).\n7. Place your cauliflower rice in a large mesh strainer, If the holes are big, line with a paper towel. \n8. Let it rest for an hour or so while rotating the cauliflower rice to get as much water out as possible. \n9.. Use a food scale and measure out your portion size (I use 12 oz / 340.2 g)\n10. Put into sous vide bags. Triple check the bags to make sure that they are completely sealed.\n11. Lay flat in the freezer. \n12. Once frozen, give it a shake and pump out all of the air.\n\nThis will last for months.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe entire cauliflower is edible. \n\nIf you use further down the stalk It will become more of a cabbage like flavor versus the florets but I use it and when you cook it and season it it doesn't taste like cabbage also helps with food waste since you're not throwing out as much cauliflower. \n\nIf you don't like making the salk into rice because you think it's too fibrous or cabbage flavor, save it and use it for other dishes, just bag and freeze.\n\nThe lighter colored green leaves can be used in dishes that require cabbage.\n\n**Food Storage**\n\nI like working with sous vide bags (see images).\n\nUnlike traditional vacuum seal bags you don't have to cut them and reseal them, they are like vacuum sealed Ziploc bags that you just bleach and reuse. Bag kits also come with spare valves so you just peel off the old valve put the new valve on and it's ready to go again.\n\nSo there is less plastic waste. \n\nI prefer a manual pump versus a battery pump since just a slightest amount of liquid will ruin the vacuum and some of them don't suck good.\n\nAlso if you buy lots of mozzarella and other cheese for chaffles and other uses, a 5 lb bag of shredded mozzarella will last for months after it's been vacuum sealed though you will have to shred up the cheese. \n\nA block of sharp cheddar will last for months after it's been cut up and vacuum sealed fresh soft mozzarella will double the life in the fridge just use caution when pumping it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gz4kd0", "created_utc": 1732490369.0, "score": 22, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gz4kd0/just_started_making_my_own_cauliflower_rice_food/", "html_title": ""}

I tried it with it and it ruined the whole dish.)\n\u2022 1/2 cup fresh shredded Gruyere cheese (divided evenly among thighs)\n\u2022 2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese (divided evenly among thighs)\n\u2022 1 tbsp finely chopped chives\n\n\nInstructions:\nSous Vide the Chicken (Preferred Method):\n1. Preheat your sous vide water bath to\n165\u00b0F.\n2. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.\n3. Place the chicken thighs in a vacuum-seal bag or a resealable zip-top bag using the water displacement method.\n4. Cook in the water bath for 2 hours.\n5. Once done, remove the thighs from the bag and pat them dry with paper towels to prepare for searing.\nAlternative Method (Non-Sous Vide):\n\u2022 Cook the chicken using your preferred method (e.g., oven, skillet, or air fryer), but ensure the thighs are fully cooked to 165\u00b0F.\nA good sear on the chicken is crucial for flavor.\n\n2. Sear the Chicken:\n1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil or PAM.\n2. Sear the thighs for 1-2 minutes per side until a golden-brown crust forms. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n3. Assemble the Layers:\n1. Spread 1 tbsp of mayonnaise evenly over the top of each chicken thigh.\n2. Layer the shredded Gruyere evenly on top of the mayo.\n3. Sprinkle the grated Parmesan over the Gruyere for a final cheesy layer.\n4. Top with a pinch of fresh chives.\n\n4. Crisp and Finish:\n\u2022 Air Fryer Method (Preferred for Crispiness):\n\u2022 Preheat the air fryer to 375\u00b0F. Place the thighs in the basket and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling.\n\u2022 Oven Method:\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Place the thighs on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes, finishing under the broiler for 2-3 minutes to brown the cheese. Be careful not to burn the cheese.\n5. Serve:\n\u2022 Let the chicken rest for 2-3 minutes after crisping. Garnish with additional chives if desired and serve immediately.\n\nNotes:\n\u2022 Sous Vide for Precision: Sous vide ensures perfectly cooked chicken with juicy, tender meat. However, this recipe works with any cooking method as long as the chicken is seared to achieve a crust.\n\u2022 Layering Matters: Layering Gruyere and Parmesan separately creates a richer texture and allows each cheese to shine. The grated Parmesan helps with the melting and crisping.\n\u2022 Keto-Friendly Pairing Ideas: Serve with roasted vegetables, cauliflower mash, Brussels sprouts, or saut\u00e9ed spinach for a complete low-carb meal.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxcub1", "created_utc": 1732295513.0, "score": 38, "author": "nicksaiz65", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gxcub1/mayo_gruyere_chive_chicken_thighs/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Like a shark can smell blood from up to a quarter of a mile away, the merest hint of cauli in a dish overwhelms it for me. This is different. When paired with meat or gravy, I can ***almost*** imagine I'm eating actual whipped potatoes. The secret is to cook it super slow and let it out-gas in the refrigerator before covering it to reduce the amount of sulfur scent (which is minimal if you make it right).\n\n[Link to video](https://youtu.be/E6vuPpXqu9A?si=uzE45a3IsKN2g4vY)\n\n=====================================================================\n\nCarnivore Mashed \u201cPotatoes\u201d Recipe:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIngredients\n\n1 stick butter (1/2 Cup, or 8 Tbsp)\n\n32 oz egg whites (25-30 whites)\n\n1/2 tsp salt\n\n1/8 tsp garlic powder (optional)\n\n2 oz cream cheese\n\n2-3 oz fresh mozzarella\n\n1 tsp Parmesan cheese\n\n2 Tbsp sour cream\n\n2 tsp toasted beef gelatin\n\n1 Tbsp regular beef gelatin\n\n1/2 tsp white pepper (optional)\n\n1-2 Tbsp egg white powder\n\nHeavy cream for blending as needed\n\n  \n\n\nMacros For Whole Recipe (Suggest 6-8 Servings Per Recipe)\n\n2018 Cal\n\n151 fat\n\n13 carbs\n\n145 protein\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMethod\n\nMelt butter over medium/low heat in non-stick skillet. Add egg whites, salt, and optional garlic powder. Scramble egg whites breaking up into small pieces while stirring. Continue cooking egg whites until all liquid has dried up in the pan leaving crumbly eggs and residual butter fat. Use low heat to avoid browning the eggs. Remove from heat and leave in skillet to stay warm monetarily.\n\nAdd cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan, sour cream, toasted gelatin, plain gelatin, and optional white pepper to blender. Add hot eggs on top. Turn blender on low. Using pusher through open hole in lid, continue encouraging egg mix to blend. If no lid opening and/or pusher is available, stop blender frequently and use a spatula or other tool to pop air bubble and continue blending. If mixture is too dry to blend add heavy cream 2-3 Tbsp at a time and continue pushing mixture down into blender blades until mixture starts to blend. Use as little cream as possible to make this happen. Slowly increase speed to high if adjustable. If not, increase in whatever increments available until blending on high. Mixture should readily flow into blades and blend but should remain as thick and dry as possible.\n\nOnce mixture becomes a smooth cohesive blended mix taste for salt. Add more if you wish. Then add egg white powder on top and blend well into mixture. Stop blender, stir to ensure there are no lumps or dry powder and blend again on high for 10-20 seconds. Remove mixture to serving bowl.\n\nIf desired, top mash with more melted butter, seasonings, bacon and sour cream, or whatever toppings you like on mashed potatoes. Serge immediately.\n\nIf cooking with these mashed potatoes (i.e. shepherds pie, etc.), do not add egg white powder at the end as this will set the potatoes firmly if cooked further.\n\nTo reheat leftover mash, heat 30 seconds at a time, stirring well each time, until hot. Use hot cream and/or melted butter as necessary to keep the mixture smooth. You may also consider adding them back to a blender to get the texture right again. Stir well and serve.\n\nIf you intend to make them ahead of time and then reheat them, leave out the egg white powder and only add a little if necessary to get the texture you want before serving however much you have reheated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gtoh18/carnivore_mashed_potatoes/", "created_utc": 1731879673.0, "score": 18, "author": "crustyloaves", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gtoh18/carnivore_mashed_potatoes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Do not allow to smoke. Remove chiles to a 2 quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl, set aside. (Alternatively, place dried chiles on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until pliable and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a 2-quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl.) Add half of chicken broth and chipotle chiles and their sauce, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high power until gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from microwave and set aside for 5 minutes. Transfer chiles and liquid to blender and blend, starting on the lowest possible setting and gradually increasing speed to high (make sure to hold the lid down with a clean kitchen towel or a potholder to prevent it from blowing out). Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.\n\nSeason beef cubes generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in the base of a Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add half of the beef cubes in a single layer and cook until deeply browned on a single side, about 3 minutes. Remove from pot, set aside with remaining unseared beef.\n\nReturn Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently until translucent and softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, and if using, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, and oregano, and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add all meat (seared and non-seared) and accumulated juices back to pan along with chile pur\u00e9e, stir to combine.\n\nBring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cover, leaving lid just barely ajar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is completely tender, about 3 hours. (Check sauce levels occasionally; if sauce gets too thick, add 1/4 cup water or stock until desired consistency is reached). Once sauce has thickened to desired consistency, cover completely for the remainder of cook time. Alternatively, chili can be cooked in a 200\u00b0 to 250\u00b0F (95\u00b0 to 120\u00b0C) oven with the lid of the Dutch oven slightly ajar.\n\nStir in optional fish sauce, and vinegar. Season to taste with salt and hot sauce. For best results, allow chili to cool and store in the refrigerator at least overnight and up to 5 days.

For some people it might be too oniony.\n\nThere is one problem you have to be careful with.\n\nBecause it has a lot of onion and no preservatives or artificial ingredients, it can start to ferment and puff up in the container very fast.\n\nAfter buying you need to go straight home with it or put it in a cooler with ice packs or ice or it will go bad very fast. \n\n* Costco - Jack's Organic Cantina Salsa\n\n3 net carb per 2 tbsp, medium heat salsa. Has the most tomato flavor. Does have sugar and potassium sorbate (a preservative) .\n\nI like this one for a medium spicy salsa but it does have artificial ingredients and sugar.\n\n* Sam's Club - Member's Mark Cilantro Pico De Gallo Style Salsa\n\n1 net carb per 2 tbsp. Has a strong cilantro flavor. \n\nThe problem with this one is this one has the most amount of liquid which is what lowers the carbohydrate count.\n\nContains xanthan gum, lactic acid, phosphoric acid and food coloring. \n\nI like all three of them, I like the Wellesley Farms one the most but it spoils the fastest.\n\nIf you're good at making your own salsa, that is always the best and you're lucky you have the time to make it, If you make a homemade salsa, make sure to let it set overnight to absorb flavors. \n\n**The chips**\n\n**Pork rinds**\n\nUse plain unflavored pork rinds, they make a good scoop style chip. \n\nPork rinds work good with the sour cream based sauces and with salsa.\n\nFlavored pork rinds have sugar and they also have MSG.\n\nBest place for pork rinds is Sam's Club or Aldi or Walmart.\n\n**Veggies**\n\nI use a mandoline and make squash chips, they are perfect for dipping in your sour cream based dips.\n\nCelery sticks works best with the sour cream based dips.\n\nCauliflower and broccoli florets works best  with the sour cream based dips.\n\n**Low carb wraps**\n\nSprinkle with some sea salt and bake in an oven or heat up in a skillet until hard and break into crackers. \n\nWorks best with cream sour cream based dips.

After brewing the coffee, add coffee to a pot, add unsweetened almond milk, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice (use more or less vanilla and pumpkin pie spice to taste), pumpkin puree (use more or less to taste, some people like it with no pumpkin puree) add sweetener to taste.\n\n2.

Instead of pouring coffee into cups, cover and put the stove on low so it won't burn and keeps it warm.\n\n2. In a bowl, add heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract. The amount of vanilla extract and sweeteners up to individual taste.\n\n3. Whisk until peaks start to form.\n\n4. Sprinkling a tiny bit of xanthan gum (optional)\n\n5.

{"title": "Keto Bourbon Anabolic French Toast Casserole", "selftext": "Recipe adapted from Joshua Weissman. \n\nKeto Bourbon Anabolic French Toast\nCasserole\n\nDescription:\nThis Keto Bourbon Anabolic French Toast Casserole combines the rich, warm flavors of bourbon, cinnamon, and lightly sweetened custard with the satisfying texture of keto-friendly Hawalian bread.\nThe custard soaks deeply into the bread, creating a soft yet structured casserole that puffs up beautifully in the oven. Topped with fresh berries, Cool Whip, and a light dusting of powdered Swerve, this dish delivers an indulgent feel while keeping it keto and packed with protein. Perfect for those aiming to hit their macros without sacrificing flavor or texture.\n\nIngredients (Makes 1 OMAD Serving)\n\u2022 8 slices Hawaiian Keto Bread (from\nWalmart, ~45 calories per slice)\n\n\u2022 3 whole eggs\n\u2022 \u00bd cup cartoned egg whites (120ml)\n\u2022 6g cinnamon (2 tsp)\n\u2022 0.6g nutmeg \n\u2022 0.6g allspice (\u00bc tsp)\n\u2022 3g fine sea salt (\u00bd tsp)\n\u2022 48g Swerve or Brown Sugar Swerve (/4\ncup, granular)\n\u2022 1 cup half & half (240ml)\n\u2022 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or Fairlife milk for more protein, 240ml)\n\u2022 15ml bourbon (1 tbsp)\n\u2022 1 cup Walmart Frozen Mixed Berries\n(140g, thawed)\n\u2022 Cool Whip (regular, 1 serving = 2 tbsp or 9g)\n\u2022 Powdered Swerve for dusting (through a fine mesh strainer)\n\u2022 Sugar-Free Ms. Buttersworth or\nWalmart syrup (optional for serving)\n\nInstructions\n1. Prep the Bread:\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C).\n\u2022 Place the slices of keto bread in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for\n10-15 minutes until lightly toasted and dried out. This helps the bread absorb the custard without getting soggy.\n2. Make the Custard:\n\u2022 In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, cartoned egg whites, cinnamon, optional nutmeg and allspice, sea salt, and Swerve or Brown Sugar Swerve until well combined.\n\u2022 Add the half & half, almond milk, and bourbon, and whisk until smooth.\n\n3. Assemble the Casserole:\n\u2022 Generously coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\n\u2022 Arrange the bread so it's shingled in two rows in the baking dish, with each slice slightly overlapping, ensuring everything fits snugly.\n\u2022 Pour the custard mixture evenly over the bread, making sure every slice is well-soaked. Gently press the bread into the custard if needed to ensure it absorbs well.\n\u2022 Cover the dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate for a minimum of 45 minutes, or overnight if prepping ahead.\n4. Bake:\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n\u2022 Bake the covered casserole for 25-30 minutes.\n\u2022 After 25-30 minutes, remove the foil. The edges of the bread should be crispy: if not, put the foil back until it is. After that, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional\n5-10 minutes until the top is lightly golden and springs back to the touch.\n\n5. Thaw the Frozen Mixed Berries:\n\u2022 Option 1: Microwave Thawing\n\u2022 Place the frozen berries in a microwave-safe bowl.\n\u2022 Microwave on defrost or low power (50%) for 30 seconds.\n\u2022 Stir the berries and continue microwaving in 15-20 second intervals, stirring each time, until fully thawed (about 1 minute total).\n\u2022 Option 2: Fridge Thawing\n\u2022 Place the frozen berries in a bowl in the fridge.\n\u2022 Let them thaw for 4-6 hours or overnight.\n\n6. Serve:\n\u2022 Let the casserole cool for 5 minutes.\n\u2022 Top with 1 cup of thawed Walmart\nFrozen Mixed Berries and 1-2 servings of Cool Whip (9-18g).\n\u2022 Lightly dust the top with powdered Swerve using a fine mesh strainer to give it a beautiful, powdered sugar look.\n\u2022 Serve with Ms. Buttersworth or\nWalmart sugar-free syrup on the side or drizzled on top for added sweetness.\nFlavors:\n\u2022 The bourbon gives a warm, smoky note that complements the subtle sweetness of the cinnamon and Swerve.\n\u2022 The custard is creamy and rich, perfectly soaked into the keto bread, creating a soft yet satisfying texture.\n\u2022 Topped with tangy berries and cool whipped cream, the dish balances flavors and textures, making it a delicious, indulgent keto meal with none of the guilt.\n\nNUTRITIONAL INFO:\nCalories: 1,550\nProtein: 120 G\nFat: 75 G\nNet Carbs: 35 G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/1jvjjjr2m6sd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1727804574.0, "score": 53, "author": "nicksaiz65", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1ftu5k3/keto_bourbon_anabolic_french_toast_casserole/", "html_title": ""}

The leftovers are delicious as well. \n\nIngredients\n1.5 lb center cut boneless pork chops\n1/2 medium onion sliced\n2 garlic cloves minced\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 cup heavy whipping cream\n1 oz cream cheese\n1/3 cup chicken broth\n1/3 cup parmesan cheese\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\nsalt to taste\nInstructions\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and let it heat up for a minute.\nSeason the pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides.\nAdd the seasoned pork chops, onions, and garlic to the skillet and cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Make sure not to overcrowd the skillet. If needed, cook the pork chops in batches to cook them evenly.\nRemove the cooked pork chops from the skillet and place them on a plate. Set aside.\nReduce the heat to medium and add the heavy whipping cream, cream cheese, chicken broth, parmesan cheese, cheddar cheese, Italian seasoning, pepper, and salt to the skillet. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth.\nContinue to stir the sauce continuously over medium heat until it thickens. This should take about 8-10 minutes.\nOnce the sauce has thickened, add the pork chops back to the skillet, making sure they are coated with the sauce.\nReduce the heat to low and let the pork chops simmer in the sauce for about 5 minutes or until the pork chops are cooked through and the sauce has thickened even further.\nOnce done, serve the pork chops hot with the creamy garlic parmesan sauce drizzled over them", "url": "https://i.redd.it/1p7yl1hhx7rd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1727384668.0, "score": 121, "author": "mikear-1", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1fq6xus/creamy_garlic_parmesan_chicken_thighs/", "html_title": ""}

Put water and nut butter into your shaker and shake the hell out of it for several minutes. \n\n2. If you don't want any nut granules in it, strain it.\n\n3. If you're straining it, return it back to the shaker.\n\n4. You can add a pinch of salt, 1/4 tsp or so vanilla extract, sweetener etc. for flavor.\n\n5. Shake some more. \n\nYou need to use nut butter with the only ingredient being nuts (no sugar, salt or oils added)\n\nCan also use peanut butter or peanut powder, just make sure the only ingredient is roasted nuts.\n\nThe second method is a little bit more detailed and takes longer. \n\nUse 1/4 cup almond flour per 1 cup water.\n\n1. Put almond flour and water into the protein shaker.\n\n2. Shake it vigorously for quite a while since you're not using an electric blender. \n\nYou're going to end up with an arm workout with this one. \n\n3. Strain it twice through a fine mesh strainer. \n\n4. If you want more flavor, return it to the shaker and add a pinch of salt, 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract, sweetener etc. and shake some more. \n\nIt's not going to have the same texture and flavor as store-bought almond milk or soaking almonds overnight and running them through a blender. \n\nThe first method will give you more of a roasted nut flavor.

{"title": "Lemon Or Lime No Bake Cheesecake ", "selftext": "This is a key lime cheesecake before I use a pastry spatula to smooth it out.\n\nThis is more like a cream cheese cheesecake then a traditional cheesecake.\n\nPart of this recipe is subject to individual taste.\n\nThis is the original recipe that I found online from Southern Keto. It is a no-bake pumpkin cheesecake that I made in a previous post.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S0AUGT84Qlw?si=7C7SIRtKykaC_a5D\n\nI had to tinker around with the recipe some because the lime overpowered the cream cheese or the sweetener overpowered everything so I did trial an error to get it to a consistency that I like.\n\nYou're going to need a 9 inch deep dish pie pan or a springboard pan with side releases.\n\nSee notes below the recipe.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nCrust:\n\n* 1.5 cups almond flour\n* 3 tbsp melted butter\n* 2 tbsp sweetener\n* 1/2 tsp nutmeg, cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice (optional)\n\nFilling:\n\n* 24 oz room temperature cream cheese\n* 2/3 cup confectioner sweetener\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 3/4 + 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream\n* Lemon juice and/or lime juice\n* Lemon zest and/or lime zest\n* Xanthan gum or other thickener (optional)\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. In a bowl, melt butter in a microwave.\n2. In a mixing bowl, add almond flour, sweetener, melted butter and optional spices.\n3. Mix well and transfer to the pie pan or springboard pan\n4. Press the crust down into the pie pan or springboard pan.\n5. In a mixing bowl, add sweetener, cream cheese, vanilla extract and 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream.\n6. Use a mixer and mix until just blended.\n7. Add 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream, add juice and zest and until blended, taste, add any additional zest and juice until you get the taste you want.\n8. Add any thickener.\n9. Mix until well blended.\n10. Scoop into the pie pan or springboard pan and level it.\n11. Put in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours for it to set.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nUnlike some store-bought key lime pies, I don't add food coloring so it doesn't look avocado green.\n\nI used allulose sweetener.\n\nI used 3 packs of Philadelphia cream cheese (8 oz packs).\n\nI used BJ's Wholesale Club heavy whipping cream. It has no binders or stabilizers and limited thickeners.\n\nUse both juice and zest because the zest has less carbs and will make it more spiky.\n\nThe amount of juice and zest that you use is up to individual taste, some people want it more tart some people want it more sweet.\n\nWest Indian limes (key limes) are more tart, I use roughly a little over 1 tbsp and a little over a half a cup juice after I squeezed them. Key limes are also called West Indian limes or Mexican bartender limes, so skip buying \"authentic key limes\" and look for those.\n\nDon't buy ungodly expensive zest, get a zester or a very fine grater and make your own. It's just the shiny part of the skin of the fruit.\n\nDon't buy confectioner sweeteners, If you have a coffee grinder or a blender with a grinding blade just pour your granulated sweetener in and make it yourself for half the cost.\n\nThis can be made with any lemon or lime and even a blend of lemon lime.\n\nA trick with lemons and limes, to get the most juice out, put it in the microwave for 15 seconds before cutting and squeezing and zesting.\n\nIf you want more of a toasted graham cracker crust, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F, bake the crust for 5 minutes or so, you can also lightly toast it in a skillet. Let it cool before scooping in the filling.\n\nBecause I used cream cheese and heavy whipping cream without thickeners or binders I added 1/2 tsp xanthan gum so the pie won't separate, If you don't use gum, you can bloom some gelatin and then add that mixture to the pie filling.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/4pvqrm93gtqd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1727209323.0, "score": 37, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1fomcy9/lemon_or_lime_no_bake_cheesecake/", "html_title": ""}

Adjust the strength according to your taste. If you don\u2019t have an espresso machine, you can use strong brewed coffee as a substitute.\n2. **Heat the Coconut Milk:**\n   * Pour 1 cup of unsweetened coconut milk into a small pot and heat over medium heat, or warm it in the microwave until it's hot but not boiling. If you prefer a smoother latte, use a whisk or milk frother to create a small amount of foam.\n3. **Add Healthy Fats:**\n   * If you want to increase the healthy fat content, add 1 teaspoon of MCT oil or coconut oil to the warmed coconut milk. Stir well to combine.\n4. **Sweeten to Taste:**\n   * Add 1-2 teaspoons of sweetener to the heated coconut milk according to your taste. For a vanilla flavor, you can also add 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\n5. **Combine Coffee and Coconut Milk:**\n   * Pour the brewed espresso into a cup, then slowly add the heated coconut milk. Stir gently to mix the coffee and coconut milk together.\n6. **Garnish and Enjoy:**\n   * If you like, sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon on top for garnish. Then, enjoy your creamy and rich keto coconut milk latte!\n\n# Tips:\n\n* **Substitutions:** If you don\u2019t like coconut milk, you can substitute with unsweetened almond milk or another low-carb plant-based milk, but make sure it fits within keto guidelines.\n* **Flavor Adjustments:** Adjust the ratio of coffee to coconut milk based on your preference for a stronger or milder latte.\n* **Iced Version:** For a cold drink, substitute espresso with cold brew coffee, and use chilled coconut milk to create an iced coconut milk latte.\n\nThis keto coconut milk latte is both simple and delicious, making it an ideal choice for those on a keto diet. It provides energy and satisfies your coffee cravings without disrupting ketosis.

In a microwave safe bowl melt the butter. \n2. In a mixing bowl add the dry ingredients \n3. Stir them together real good \n4. Mix in the melted butter, make sure to break up any large pieces \n5. Spray the bottom of the pie pan with oil\n6. Gently pour in the mixture into the pie pan\n7. Gently press in the crust batter, Make sure that the crust is even.\n\nOptional: I baked mine at 350\u00b0F for 5 minutes in a preheated oven to give it more of a graham cracker like texture. \n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 2 packs room temperature cream cheese \n* 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream \n* 1 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix) \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n*  2/3 cups confectionery sweetener (I made brown sugar allulose) see notes\n* 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n* Xanthan gum (see notes)\n\n1. In a mixing bowl, add 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream plus the sweetener and mix it until blended\n2. Break your cream cheese into chunks so it will be easier to mix and add it\n3. Mix on low until smooth \n4. Add remaining ingredients including optional thickener\n5. Mix on low until smooth\n6. Spoon in batter into the prepared pie pan\n7. Even the batter and let refrigerate at least 6 hours (I do mine overnight) \n\n**Optional topping:**\n\nAfter your cheesecake has set and it is ready to serve, I top mine with a little bit of homemade keto whipped topping and sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon on it. \n\n**Notes**\n\n**Xanthan gum**\n\nThe original recipe uses cream cheese and heavy whipping cream that has ingredients like polysorbate 80, mono and diglycerides, carrageenan and other binding agents. \n\nI use Philadelphia brand cream cheese or organic valley cream cheese.\n\nI use BJ's Wholesale Club or organic valley heavy whipping cream. \n\nThose have minimal binders and the cheesecake will separate and start to liquefy. \n\nAdd 1/4 tsp at a time of xanthan gum or thickener of choice until you get a texture that you like.\n\n**Sweetener**\n\nIf you have a blender with a grinding blade or a coffee grinder, it is much cheaper to make your own confectionery sweetener. \n\nI made this with homemade keto brown sugar I made 2/3 cup powdered allulose and added 1/4 teaspoon molasses into the batter to give it more of a traditional pumpkin pie taste. \n\n**Variations**\n\nThis is a very versatile recipe, here's some that I have made: \n\n* Omit the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin and add 1 cup fruit puree for a berry cheesecake add a thickener if the berry puree is too thin, add additional sweetener if your fruit is too tart.\n\n* Omit the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin and add unsweetened cocoa powder. \n\nTake a little bit of your heavy whipping cream, add the cocoa powder and a little thickener and put that in a smoothie blender, blend it until the cocoa powder is no longer grainy. Add any additional sweetener that you might need. (That will be a smaller cheesecake).\n\n* Plain cheesecake, omit pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin puree. Bake the pie crust for 5 or so minutes for a more graham cracker texture. (This will make a smaller cheesecake).\n\nI've made the plain cheesecake recipe into a lemon cheesecake and a key lime cheesecake by adding lemon juice and lemon zest and lime juice and lime zest.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/p7yqb96nt9nd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1725664197.0, "score": 36, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1fassjn/keto_no_bake_pumpkin_cheesecake_including/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Keto Cheesecake ", "selftext": "KETO STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE\n\nPREP: 15 minutes, COOK: 1 hour, CHILLING TIME: 4 hours, TOTAL: 1 hour 15 minutes, SERVINGS: 12\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nCRUST:\n\n2 cups Blanched Almond Flour\n\n1/3 cup unsalted butter (measured solid, then melted)\n\n2 tbsp Monk Fruit Allulose Blend (Granulated)\n\n1 tsp Vanilla extract\n\nCHEESECAKE FILLING:\n\n32 oz Cream cheese (softened)\n\n1 1/4 cup Allulose Sugar Replacement (Powdered)\n\n3 large Eggs\n\n1 tbsp Lemon juice\n\n1 tsp Vanilla extract\n\nSTRAWBERRY TOPPING:\n\n1 1/2 lb Fresh strawberries (divided, 1/2 lb chopped and 1 lb cut into halves)\n\n1/2 cup ChocZero Keto Strawberry Jam\n\n1/2 tbsp Lemon juice\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with parchment paper. (I didn\u2019t do the parchment paper and the crust didn\u2019t stick so I would say this is probably optional)\n\n2. To make the crust, stir the almond flour, melted butter, sugar substitute, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl, until well combined. The dough will be slightly crumbly. Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for about 10 minutes, until barely golden. Let cool for at least 10 minutes.\n\n3. In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to beat the cream cheese and Allulose Powdered at low to medium speed, until fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Finally, beat in the lemon juice and vanilla extract. (Keep the mixer at low to medium the whole time; too high speed will introduce too many air bubbles, which we don't want.)\n\n4. Pour the filling into the pan over the crust. Smooth the top with a spatula (use a pastry spatula for a smoother top if you have one).\n\n5. Bake for about 45-55 minutes, until the center is almost set, but still jiggly. (If you want to be extra careful to avoid cracks, you can wrap the pan in 2 layers of foil, place the pan in a larger baking dish, and fill the dish with warm water going halfway up the sides of the pan. This is called a water bath and helps the temperature change more gradually during baking.)\n\n6. Remove the cheesecake from the oven. If the edges are stuck to the pan, run a knife around the edge (don't remove the springform edge yet). Cool in the pan on the counter to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight), until completely set.\n\n7. Meanwhile, to make the strawberry sauce, combine the chopped strawberries, lemon juice, and jam in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Simmer for about 10 minutes, mashing the sauce as the berries soften, until the strawberries start to break down and a sauce forms.\n\n8. Stir the halved strawberries into the sauce. Heat for 2-3 minutes, until the halves are soft, but not mushy. Remove from heat and let the sauce cool completely to room temperature.\n\n9. Once the cheesecake is set, run a knife along the edges of the springform pan again and remove the sides of the pan. You can carefully transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate, or simply use the bottom of the springform pan for serving.\n\n10. Spoon most of the liquid part of the strawberry sauce over the cheesecake. Arrange the strawberry halves on top. Use any leftover sauce for serving.\n\nNutrition Facts (amount per serving):\n\nServings: 12, Calories: 471, Fat: 41.7g, Protein: 10.6g, Total Carbs: 11g, Net Carbs: 6.8g\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/dfueoe9r84kd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1724289097.0, "score": 65, "author": "GiantChef1", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1ey6lht/keto_cheesecake/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sugar-free Stabilized Whipped Topping AKA Cool Whip", "selftext": "Since I saw that delicious pumpkin cheesecake, thought I would share my recipe that I use for homemade Cool Whip.\n\nThis is made just like making homemade whipped topping AKA Reddi-whip but with a couple of extra ingredients and a little bit more sweetener to make it taste like Cool Whip. \n\nI make mine with unflavored gelatin but it can be made with Xanthan gum. I prefer it with gelatin because it holds up better in the freezer and people have left it sitting on the table for a day at room temperature and it did not melt.\n\nThe amount of vanilla and sweetener are up to individual taste. \n\nCan be made with any sweetener, I prefer allulose.\n\nHere's a tip, never buy confectioner or powdered sweetener. Buy granulated and put it in a coffee grinder or a blender with a grinder blade and you'll save a lot of money. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup heavy whipping cream \n* 1/4 to 1/3 cup powdered sweetener, I use 1/3 cup\n* 1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract, I use 1 tsp \n\n**And one of the following:**\n\n* 1/4 tsp Xanthan gum or other thickener that's 1:1 ratio.\n\n**OR**\n\n* 1 tsp unflavored gelatin + 4 tsp cold water\n\n**How To Bloom The Gelatin:**\n\n1. In a small microwavable bowl, add 4 teaspoons of cold water, slowly sprinkle the gelatin on top. \n\n2. Let it set for for 4 minutes.\n\n3. Place in the microwave, microwave until it's dissolved, that will only be a few seconds! \n\nYou might need to give it a little swirl with a non-stick spatula, you want it dissolved so that it won't be lumpy.\n\n**You do not need to do anything with a gum**\n\n**Preperation:**\n\n1. If possible, freeze a metal mixing bowl for at least 30 minutes (skip if using glass or plastic).\n\n2. Add heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract and whisk until soft peaks form.\n\n3. Sprinkle in the xanthan gum slowly or add the gelatin paste. \n\n4. Continue whisking until it doubles in size. \n\n5. Use immediately or transfer to containers. \n\nCan use a food processor with an S mixing blade.\n\nCan be stored in the refrigerator up to a week. \n\nCan be frozen, If you're going to freeze it it works better with gelatin than xanthan gum, it will harden a bit with xanthan gum. \n\nIf you don't know how to make regular whipped topping: \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 cup heavy whipping cream \n* 1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract \n* 2 to 3 tbsp sweetener (can use erythritol)\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. If possible freeze a metal bowl for 30 minutes (Skip is using plastic or glass) \n\n2. Add all ingredients to bowl\n\n3. Whisk until stiff peaks form\n\nUse immediately, regular whip topping will liquefy fast in the refrigerator.\n\nDo not freeze, it will turn into a brick and will liquefy when melting.\n\nIf you need a small amount, reduce the recipe by 50%.

{"title": "Peanut Butter Protein Cookies", "selftext": "After a bunch of experimenting, I found a recipe that even my son likes!

Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2. In a large bowl, mix the peanut butter, butter, erythritol, water, cream and eggs until well combined.\n3. Add the almond flour, peanut butter protein powder, crushed peanuts, baking powder, and salt (if using). Mix until a dough forms.\n4. Scoop the dough into balls (about 2 tablespoons each) and place on the prepared baking sheet.\n5. Flatten each ball with a fork, creating a crisscross pattern. More flat = more crisp\n6. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.\n7. Leave cookies in the oven with heat turned off and door slightly open to continue drying out\n8.

{"title": "White BBQ Sauce aka Alabama White Sauce", "selftext": "I don't do keto but my boyfriend does and I've refined this recipe that he and I can both eat.\n\nThis is a traditional barbecue sauce that's based on mayonnaise, mustard, honey and horseradish and not with tomato.\n\nNormally it is very watery and is brushed on the protein or drizzled on the protein.\n\nI put a little bit of xanthan gum in it and it gives it a thickness so it will not separate and you can put it in a squeeze bottle and squirt it on a burger or chicken or hot dog and use it like a regular barbecue sauce.\n\nAlso using a thickener helps with portion size, you don't dump the whole container on a burger because it's watery, squeezing it out you'll use just the right amount.\n\nYou can also make it with or without the thickener and drizzle it over grilled vegetables.\n\nThis recipe is modified from the Duke's Mayonnaise website, traditional white sauce is made with Duke's Mayonnaise and French's Dijon mustard and is made without a thickener.\n\nThis is my variation:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1 cup Duke's Mayonnaise (or homemade mayo or other brand, the taste will be different) **DO NOT USE MIRACLE WHIP !!!** \n\n1/3 cup apple cider vinegar\n\n3+ tbsp pure lemon juice not from concentrate (see notes)\n\n2 tbsp white balsamic vinegar (see notes for substitution)\n\n1/4 tsp granulated garlic\n\n1/4 tsp onion powder\n\n1/2 tsp salt\n\n1 tsp ground black pepper\n\n2 1/2 tsp prepared horseradish (see notes)\n\n1 tbsp French's Dijon mustard (or homemade Dijon mustard or other brand, the taste will be different) **DON'T USE PLAIN YELLOW MUSTARD !!** You can use brown mustard but that will affect the taste.\n\n1/4 tsp paprika (can use smoked paprika)\n\n1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper\n\n1/2 tsp sweetener of choice (If using allulose or erythritol, make it a heaping 1/2 tsp).\n\n1 tsp Worcestershire sauce\n\nAdditional black pepper to taste (optional)\n\n1/4 tsp xanthan gum or other thickener (optional)\n\n**Equipment:**\n\nBlender\n\nFunnel\n\nSqueeze bottles (or other airtight storage container minimum 20 oz)\n\nMeasuring spoons\n\nMeasuring cups\n\nMixing bowl\n\nManual whisk\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. Whisk all ingredients except xanthan gum together in a mixing bowl. Don't use an electric whisk it will splatter everywhere and you'll end up with a mess.\n\nSee notes if using coarse ground horseradish.\n\n2. (Optional) Lightly sprinkle in the xanthan gum, keep whisking as you sprinkle it, that will keep it from clumping. \n\n3. (Optional) Keep whisking until it starts to thicken.\n\nDepending on how thick you want it you might need more than 1/4 teaspoon but I like it at 1/4 teaspoon that gives it the consistency of mustard.\n\n4. Use a funnel and pour into squeeze bottles or pour it into an airtight container.\n\n5. Refrigerate and let set 1+ hour (preferably overnight) before using.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nYou can add more or less horseradish or cayenne pepper or other seasonings to taste depending on how much of a kick or spice you prefer.\n\nThis fit in two 10 oz Dollar Tree aqueeze bottles filled evenly with a little room to spare.\n\nMiracle whip and/or yellow mustard will give it a gross taste, the yellow mustard will overpower it and give it a sour taste. \n\nSome of the avocado oil mayo and organic mayonnaise are a bit on the watery side, if you're going to use those, add extra xanthan gum.\n\nCan substitute 5 tsp white wine vinegar + 1 tsp sweetener (use a little extra sweetener if using erythritol or allulose)\n\nWhite balsamic vinegar gives it a really good kick but it does add a few carbs for the entire batch.\n\nIf using coarse ground prepared horseradish, puree horseradish with apple cider vinegar in a blender before adding to the mixing bowl, I do it in my smoothie blender. I prefer course ground because it gives it more of a kick.\n\nSome people make their own prepared horseradish but that will burn your eyes for a week due to the potency of the horseradish, just take a big bite of fake wasabi....\n\nIf using a fresh lemon to get the most juice out, let lemon get to room temperature and microwave whole unsliced for 10 to 15 seconds before juicing.\n\nYou want the horseradish that is in the produce section or in the fresh pickle section, something like this:\n https://www.target.com/p/silver-spring-fresh-ground-coarse-cut-horseradish-8oz/-/A-51068371. Stores like whole foods market have cleaner versions than this one.\n\n**Storage:**\n\nKeep in a tightly sealed container or tightly sealed squeeze bottle.\n\nWith a thickener, it'll last a couple of weeks or so.\n\nWithout a thickener it will separate and you will get a week out of it. If you're not using a thickener and it starts to separate add a tablespoon of mayo and start whisking it.\n\nYou can freeze it.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1esgfdg/white_bbq_sauce_aka_alabama_white_sauce/", "created_utc": 1723679039.0, "score": 62, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1esgfdg/white_bbq_sauce_aka_alabama_white_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Keto Dolma", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my copycat keto dolma recipe with you. Dolma (stuffed bell peppers) is a traditional Turkish dish typically made with rice, with or without meat. However, I created a keto version using cauliflower rice.\n\nTraditionally, Turks add ground beef or saut\u00e9ed beef to the filling, or they prepare it without meat, using only olive oil, which elevates the dish to the next level. If you make it without meat, I highly recommend saving some for the next day, as anything with olive oil tastes even better after resting.\n\nSince I\u2019m a bit tired of eating meat, I decided to add olives for a touch of saltiness and feta cheese for richness. I also included tomatoes, which are a traditional ingredient.\n\nI served it with yogurt, which is a must.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can make it: In a pot, partially cook the cauliflower rice and salt it well. In a bowl, chop some tomatoes, olives (a great way to add healthy fats), and feta cheese. Season with your favorite spices\u2014oregano, black pepper, paprika, and Aleppo pepper work great.\n\nCut the tops off the bell peppers, clean out the insides, and stuff them with your mixture. Keep the tops and cover the stuffed peppers with them.\n\nIn a small bowl, mix tomato paste, olive oil, and some water (you can use bone broth instead if you prefer) and drizzle this mixture over the peppers. Cover the pan and cook until the peppers are fork-tender, approximately 40 minutes.\n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/gwpquvaydqid1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1723685500.0, "score": 27, "author": "National_Formal_3867", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1esirya/keto_dolma/", "html_title": ""}

If you have enough from thuna or cauliflower pizza dough this could be for you.\n\nYou'll need:\n\nFor the dough\n100 gram powdered almond\n200 gram grated mozzarella \n2 Tbsp cream cheese\n1 egg\n1 tsp garlic granule\n1/4th tsp salt\n\nFor the topping\n2 Tbsp tomato paste\n200 gram grated gouda \n1 garlic clove + 1 Tbsp olive oil\nAdditions such as salami, olives, pepperoni to liking\nOregano \n\nFirst you put the mozzarella and the cream cheese in a microwave safe dish and mix it around. Microwave it for about 90 seconds. If there is no microwave available you can just heat it in a pot until it melted.\n\nNext add the almond powder, the egg, the garlic granule and the salt. Mix thoroughly, first with a fork, then with your hand.\n\nPut 2 sheets of baking paper on top of each other onto the baking sheet. Pour the dough into the center.  Put a large sheet of plastic wrap over it. Next flatten the dough with your hands. You could use a rolling pin afterwards but I didn't need to. The plastic wrap is relevant so nothing sticks to your hands or pin.\n\nHeat your oven to 200 degrees C using circulating air. Bake the dough for at least 5-7 minutes. (I didn't do that. I was dubious about the consistency so I gave it another 5 minutes.)\n\nNext the recipe says to turn the dough around. That's what the 2 layers of baking paper are for. This step is optional and I didn't risk ruining the crust.\n\nMix the tomato paste with water and spread it over the pizza. I needed to use 3 Tbsp paste instead of 2. Probably didn't add enough water.\n\nCut up the garlic clove and mix it with a little olive oil and spread it over the pizza. This step is optional.\n\nAdd remaining toppings to liking and bake the pizza for another 10 minutes.\n\nThe result has potential. I forgot to add part of the almond and it was a little soft because of that probably. Once it cooled down somewhat it had pizza like consistency however.\n\nThis pizza is enough to serve 2 people 2 large, filling pieces each.

{"title": "Heavenly Delicious Keto Cauliflower Pizza Crust", "selftext": "# Keto Cauliflower Pizza Crust\n\n**Description:** This keto cauliflower pizza crust is a delicious, low-carb alternative to traditional pizza crusts. It\u2019s crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and a perfect base for your favorite keto-friendly toppings. Made from cauliflower, cheese, and a few simple seasonings, it's a great way to enjoy pizza while staying within your keto lifestyle.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 large cauliflower head (about 1.5 to 2 cups of riced cauliflower)\n* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 large egg\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. **Preheat Oven:**\n   * Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.\n2. **Prepare Cauliflower:**\n   * Remove the stems and leaves from the cauliflower. Cut it into florets. Use a food processor to pulse the cauliflower into a rice-like texture. You should have about 2-3 cups of riced cauliflower.\n   * Steam the riced cauliflower in a pot for about 5 minutes until tender, or microwave it in a covered bowl for about 4-5 minutes.\n3. **Remove Moisture:**\n   * Place the steamed cauliflower in a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for getting a crispy crust.\n4. **Mix Ingredients:**\n   * In a large bowl, combine the drained cauliflower, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but manageable.\n5. **Form the Crust:**\n   * Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet. Press and spread it out into a circular shape, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Use the back of a spoon or your hands to shape it evenly.\n6. **Bake the Crust:**\n   * Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and crispy around the edges.\n7. **Add Toppings (Optional):**\n   * If you want to add toppings, remove the crust from the oven, add your favorite keto-friendly toppings (e.g., tomato sauce, cheese, meats, and vegetables), and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes, or until the toppings are cooked and cheese is melted.\n8. **Serve:**\n   * Allow the pizza to cool slightly before slicing.

{"title": "Pressure cooker carnitas, cooks in just 30 minutes", "selftext": "[The recipe is taken from here](https://villacocina.com/carnitas-recipes/), with a few adjustments, and some edits made for clearer instructions. First of all, the full eight pounds that the recipe calls for does not fit in the standard 6-quart Instant Pot. So all measurements have been cut in half, and the cook time has been reduced from 40 minutes to 30. The natural release time of 10 minutes remains unchanged.\n\nSecond, the recipe calls for pork belly with the skin, and I chose skinless. And it calls for bone-in pork shoulder, while mine was boneless. [Everything still came out fine.](https://imgur.com/a/Zojje4v)\n\nThe recipe may look long and complicated, but it really just comes down to: Throw together some seasoning liquid, chop up some pork, brown the pork, throw the liquid and pork into the pot, cook it, let the steam release, then finish the carnitas in the broiler.\n\nThe pork itself:\n\n* 1.5 pounds pork belly\n* 2.5 pounds pork shoulder (aka Boston butt)\n* 1 tbsp avocado oil (olive oil or coconut oil are probably fine too)\n\nBut first, we create the seasoning liquid.\n\n* 1/4 medium white onion, roughly diced \n* 3/4 tsp Mexican oregano, dry (I used regular oregano)\n* 1/4 tsp black pepper, whole\n* 2 cloves, whole \n* 1/4 tsp dry thyme\n* 1/4 cup orange juice (2 ounces, or about half an orange; Google estimates just 6g of carbs there)\n* 1/4 cup water (with another 1/4 cup added later)\n* 1 tbsp kosher salt (but it can be any salt, really)\n\nPlace these ingredients in a blender and blend until everything is well-mixed. Set the liquid aside while you prep the pork.\n\nAlso set aside: \n\n* The rind from the half of an orange that you just squeezed\n\n* 1 head of garlic (That is, an entire bulb, not just a single clove; one clove contains about 1g of net carbs, but we won't be eating it -- it's just there to add flavor during the cooking process.)\n\n* 2 bay leaves\n\n\n1. The Pork: Start with the pork shoulder, cutting it into large pieces. You will need to cut around the bone, but don\u2019t throw it away -- we are using it. Now, with the knife, remove the skin from the pork belly and cut into large squares. Don\u2019t cut them too small. Cut the remainder of the belly into the same size and shape as the skin. Set aside momentarily. \n\n2. Instant pot, 6 qt : First step is to brown the meat. Set your instant pot on HIGH SAUTE mode. Set it to 30 MINUTES. You can add more time later, if needed. Go ahead and START it. Once done preheating, pour in the avocado oil and brown each side of the meat, starting with the pork shoulder. *[Note from me: I did it for about 2 minutes on a side. Took about half an hour for the whole thing.]* Don\u2019t over-crowd the pot. Be patient and do it in batches. Transfer the pork pieces into a large dish as they become ready. Brown the bone as well. Up next, our final batch, the pork belly.\n\n3. When all the pork is done browning, press CANCEL. Place all the pork back into the pot, and pour in the seasoned blended mix. Pour the other 1/4 cup of water into the blender cup, swirl and pour into the pot. Slice the top of the garlic bulb off to expose the cloves, then add the bulb, bay leaves and the half of an orange rind that we set aside earlier.\n\n4. COVER, secure the lid and cook on HIGH PRESSURE for 30 MINUTES, with a 10 MINUTE  NATURAL PRESSURE RELEASE. *[Note from me: Begin heating your broiler when there is about 10 minutes left on the cook time.]* After the natural pressure release is done, QUICK RELEASE the remaining pressure. Finally, press CANCEL and remove the lid. The carnitas should be super tender. \n\n5. Transfer all the carnitas on to a sheet pan and evenly spread them. Don\u2019t shred them at this point, to prevent them from drying out. Place the sheet pan in the broiler -- use oven mitts, because the sheet pan can get really hot. Allow the carnitas to brown and crisp up a bit -- about 5-10 minutes. Be careful if you hear the occasional grease popping, it may happen. TURN OFF the broiler as soon as the carnitas look ready. Remove the sheet pan from the oven, shred the carnitas apart and ENJOY in TACOS or as you desire.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1edu0g6/pressure_cooker_carnitas_cooks_in_just_30_minutes/", "created_utc": 1722123786.0, "score": 27, "author": "Captain_Midnight", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1edu0g6/pressure_cooker_carnitas_cooks_in_just_30_minutes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Coat generously with almond flour, making sure there are no bare spots, and allow the excess to shake off back onto the dish. Now redip the chicken in the egg, allow excess to run off. Then coat in breading mix, making sure there are no bare spots.\n\n4) pan fry chicken pieces in butter on medium-high heat until breading begins to brown. Flip, repeat and then place fried pieces in a greased baking dish (I use large glass dishes).\n\n5) melt butter in the microwave and mix in a generous helping of tarragon. Pour over fried pieces of chicken to ensure that the breading is saturated and not dry. Dry breading will end up tasting like burnt pork rinds!!!\n\nNote: if you are making a large batch, make sure to pour butter on the bottom layer first, then stack another layer of chicken on top (i try to stagger the pieces a bit) and add butter over the second layer. Once there is a generous amount of butter in the dish, you can use a spoon or ladle to collect some from the bottom to pour over pieces that are dry.\n\n6) bake at 350\u00b0F for 30-45 minutes until chicken is done internally. I like to remove it from the oven every 15 minutes to reapply butter to the breading to ensure it doesnt dry out. I just cut a few of the larger pieces from different spots to check the doneness of the chicken.\n\n7) while chicken is cooking, I like to make a side of butter with more tarragon to pour over the chicken and sides. Just melt more butter and mix tarragon to taste.\n\nThats it. Its a bit of a process, but its delicious if you do it right. This was my favorite recipe before keto and it took a few attempts to make it keto. Goes great with cauliflour rice and broccoli which also taste great with the tarragon butter drizzled over them ;). It also reheats well in the microwave, but make sure to apply butter over the pieces prior to reheating to prevent drying out the breading.\n\nWhen it comes to ingredient amounts, it will all depends on the size and quantity of the chicken pieces. The tarragon goes a long way and it doesnt take a lot. I use maybe a table spoon or two per 8oz of butter. Its better to have more ready than less when you get started so you dont run out of ingredients while you are in the breading and frying stage of the process.\n\nLastly, I like to make kind of an assembly line on the counter. A bowl with eggs, then a plate or bowl with almond flour, then another dish with the breading mix and then a baking dish for the oven on the other side of the stove so each piece of chicken can go from one thing to the next easily. I use the same egg dish for the pre and post flour egg application.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. Hopefully the recipe isnt too hard to follow and you enjoy it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1du4d47", "created_utc": 1719976434.0, "score": 25, "author": "dctravis", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1du4d47/chicken_tarragon/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Keto Cheesecake with crust", "selftext": "So I think I cracked the code. Ive made plenty of keto cheesecakes with no crust just really because I couldn\u2019t find recipes I like. But yesterday, while sitting at work, I had an epiphany. As a happy accident a while ago, I found Benton\u2019s Snickerdoodle almond flour cookies, 1 net carbs per serving and 3 net carbs per package, so why not turn them into a crust? And man I was not disappointed. And it was simple:\n\n\nCrush the cookies.\nAdd melted butter to bind\nBake in oven at 375 for 10 minutes. Let cool\nThen add whatever cheesecake recipe you use. \nFor my small cheese cake recipe:\nPreheat oven to 300\n8oz of Philadelphia cream cheese (room temp)\n3/8-1/2 cup of sour cream (room temp)\n1 egg (room temp)\nRoughly 1-2 teaspoons vanilla extract.\n1/4-1/3 cup of Lakanto monk fruit powdered sugar.\n\nMix the cream cheese and sour cream with a hand mixer. Once smooth, add the egg and vanilla. Once blended add the sweetener. Poor mixture over crust. For my crust I used about two servings of the snickerdoodle cookies. But a dish of hot water on the lower baking rack in the oven under where the cheese cake will go. And bake for 50 minutes. Now my dish I used for the cheese cake was glass roughly 4-5 inches wide and 4 inches deep. It was just what I had that I thought would fit the ingredients and it worked lovely. All in all the total carbs netted 9-11 carbs for the entire thing. Which i would not recommend eating it all in one sitting although its so good, it would be tempting.

My daughter eats donuts and ice cream and I can't deprive her of that because of my diet. So I cheated with chocolate covered strawberries my daughter made for me. That led to me back to my old habits- quick. I gained back the 10 plus 25 more! I swore I'd never do keto again. \n\nI was on a diet in 2019 and I never did keto. It was a low sugar, low calorie diet. It worked wonders.  I lost 38 lbs in 6 months. I was 162 and 5 3\" and got back to 121! The first 10 came off super quick. I still ate small amounts of sugar, because I didnt want to deprive myself. The last 3 months on the diet (for dessert) I was only eating froyo bars with 7 grams of sugar (2 a day) or some halo top in a regular cone. Basically, I was more strict the last few months.  It's only a few years later and I want to do that diet but don't have access to the same food. I am doing keto (just started) but I'm not sure it's for me. I read about the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol associated with keto. It says if you have any risk factors (heart , cholesterol) to not do Keto. Also, I'm struggling with the super low sugar. I know you can have a little sugar on keto but I don't have access to a stove. I live in a hotel rn. I'm buying a bigger freezer so my daughter and I can eat healthier prepared meals.

You could replace with other high density sweeteners such as Neotame, which is 8000 times sweeter than sugar, hence if you use Neotame you should use just 0.05g of it!\n\n\nIngredient List:\n8 Medium (464g) Eggs, chicken, whole, raw\n27g Double cream\n53g Water\n140g Butter, unsalted\n3 Teaspoon (13.2g)  Vanilla Extract\n1.1g Stevia Glycerite\n340g Almond Flour\n\u00be Teaspoon (4.8g)  Salt\n3 Teaspoon (12.0g)  Baking powder\n\nMethod:\nPreheat your oven to 160C or 325F. \nButter and line two round 8-inch cake tin. \nMelt the butter to just melted.\nIn large bowl, whisk together well the eggs, milk, melted butter, vanilla, salt, baking powder and stevia.\nAdd the almond flour whisk until batter is smooth. \nDivide the batter between the two tin evenly. \nBake the cakes in the middle of the oven until raised, 19-25 minutes, it will not brown like a standard cake, it may brown in places but will be largely a pale beige. \nPrick with a skewer, once it comes out clean, remove the cakes from the oven and place them on a wire rack. \nLet them cool for 10 minutes, invert each directly onto the wire rack.\nLeave to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.\n\nRecipe:Blueberry Compote\n\nDescription:A delicious blueberry Compote, sweet with that delicious blueberry flavour and textured and nicely thickened, to a slightly less than jam thickness. \n\nCan be spread onto British scones, in a pie, served with chocolate cake and cream or anyway you enjoy.\n\nI make this as a treat whilst on my keto diet, sweetened with two sweeteners to provide a 'rounded' sweetness. These amounts are based on the concentrated powders not the liquid drops, if you wish to avoid sucrolose you could add double the quantities of monkfruit powder.\n\n\nIngredient List:\n268g Blueberries\n0.27 Tablespoon (3.71g)  Lemon juice\n0.54 Teaspoon (2.58g)  Konjac Powder\n0.27g Stevia Sucralose Mix\n\nMethod:\nPlace blueberries into large pan, bring to a low boil. \nReduce heat to a simmer, until blueberries are soft and starting to break up. \nAdd konjac powder and using a balloon whisk victoriously, to ensure that konjac powder doesn't form lumps. \nAdd the sweeteners, we use two different sweeteners for a more rounded sweetness. If you wish to substitute with monk fruit double the weight. \nPlace into sterilised jars.\n\n\nOr get the recipes from here\n\nhttps:/www.menutizr.com/#/cmVjaXBlPTI4OTg=\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/6goebzwnqfxe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745784850.0, "score": 233, "author": "Vegetable_Log_3954", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1k9db2t/blueberry_and_lemon_cream_cake/", "html_title": ""}

To make it fit his diet, I left out the potatoes and replaced the b\u00e9chamel with cream... it's delicious! \n\n Sorry if there are any mistakes, I used chat gpt to translate my recipe\n\n\n**Ingredients for a medium-sized dish (6 servings) :**\n\n*\u2022 For the vegetables :*\n\n-3 eggplants\n-2 zucchinis (zucchini is optional in traditional Greek moussaka)\n\n-Vegetable oil (if you fry \u2013 traditional method) or olive oil (or any vegetable oil of your choice) if you prefer baking in the oven, using an air fryer, or saut\u00e9ing in a pan (a lighter version. According to my research, even in Greece, many families do it this way now).\n\n\n*\u2022 For the meat sauce :*\n\n-400g ground meat (traditionally lamb, but I always use beef)\n-1 finely chopped onion\n-1 garlic clove\n-3 tbsp olive oil\n-400g crushed tomatoes\n-1 tbsp tomato paste\n-1 bay leaf\n-A pinch of cinnamon powder\n-A pinch of grated nutmeg\n-Optional: clove\n-Salt and pepper to taste (I use about \u00be or 1 level tsp of salt and half a tsp of pepper)\n\n\n*\u2022 For assembling :*\n\n-Fried or roasted vegetables\n-Meat sauce\n-Hard salty cheese \n*(choose from: kefalograviera, graviera, kefalotyri, or parmigiano reggiano, pecorino romano, or grana padano)*, about 100g in total *(adjust to your taste)*\n-500g cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\n*(I use French thick cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, 30% fat. If unavailable, I guess you could mix sour cream with heavy cream)*\n-Optional: 1 egg yolk\n\n\n*\u2022 Preparing the vegetables :*\n\n-Slice the washed eggplants and zucchinis into rounds the thickness of a pinky finger (about 0.5\u20131 cm).\n\n-Salt and let them sit in a colander for 30 min to draw out moisture. Pat them dry with paper towels.\n\n*\u2022 Frying version :*\n\n-Heat enough oil for frying. The oil should be hot but not boiling. \nAdd the slices (enough to fill the pan without overcrowding for even cooking).\n\n-Flip halfway through. Remove them before they turn golden, once they become tender.\n\n-Drain on paper towels and use another layer to soak up excess oil.\n\n-Repeat until all veggies are cooked. Use two pans if you can\u2014it speeds things up.\n\n-Do the same with the zucchini.\n\n*\u2022 Oven version :*\n\n-Use a pastry brush to apply a thin layer of oil to both sides of the slices.\nI use about 5 tbsp of oil in total.\n\nBaking time depends on your oven. As a guide: ~15 minutes at 390\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n\nDon\u2019t open the oven too early. Avoid overbaking or drying them out.\n\n\n*\u2022 Making the meat sauce :*\n\nTip for stainless steel pans : heat the pan empty until a drop of water dances across the surface.\n Remove from heat, add oil, then return to heat.\n\n-Add chopped onion, saut\u00e9 over medium-low heat for ~8 min. Add chopped garlic.\n\n-After 2 more minutes, turn up the heat and brown the meat. Add a little salt. \nBreak it up with a wooden spatula until browned and sizzling.\n\n-Add the remaining sauce ingredients. \nAdd a small glass of water if needed. \nLet simmer on low heat for 30 min until thickened.\n Taste and adjust seasoning.\n\n\n\n*\u2022 Cream mixture :*\n\n-Add a pinch of pepper and nutmeg to the cream, and half the cheese.\n\n-(Optional: mix in 1 egg yolk.)\n\n-Taste and add salt if needed (remember the cheese is salty).\n\n\n\n*\u2022 Assembly :*\n\n-In a baking dish, start with a layer of zucchini.\n\n-Add a layer of eggplant (half of them).\n\n-Stir 1 big spoon of the cream into the meat sauce, plus a bit of cheese if you like.\n\n-Pour all the meat sauce over the eggplants. Spread evenly.\n\n-Add the remaining eggplants, then the cream mixture.\n\n-Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake in a preheated oven at 390\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 30\u201345 min (or about 1h at 355\u00b0F / 180\u00b0C), depending on your oven, vegetable thickness, etc.\n\n-Cover with foil if it browns too fast.\n\n-Once done, let rest for 15 min before serving with a fresh salad.\n\n\n**Nutrition per portion (1/6 of the dish)\n(based on the full original recipe, baked version, no egg yolk)**\n**\u2022 Calories: ~725 kcal ; Net carbs: ~18.1 g (~10%) ; Protein: ~28.9 g (~15%) ; Fat: ~61.9 g (~75%)**\n\n*\u2022 Low-Carb Adjustments (Optional) :*\n\n*\u2022 Use only 2 eggplants instead of 3*\n*\u2022 Omit the zucchini*\n*\u2022 Use 300g crushed tomatoes + 30g tomato paste instead of 400g + 50g*\n*\u2022 Replace the onion with a small shallot or use only 30g onion*\n*\u2022 Avoid adding sugar or starchy veggies anywhere else*\n\n\n*Since there are fewer vegetables, you can use a slightly smaller dish, space the eggplant slices a little, or simply make one layer of eggplant, followed by the meat sauce, then cream and cheese...*\n\n*With these changes, you can bring it down to ~12\u201313g net carbs per portion*\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juenvc", "created_utc": 1744121871.0, "score": 194, "author": "debbiefrench____", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1juenvc/keto_greek_moussaka/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Remember everyone's bodies are different, you may want to adjust the carb intakes of the recipe a bit, but I had no problem with it for 6 months.\n\nIt's a chocolate blend of nuts and some grains that works well for me. While maintaining a below 30-50 grams of carbs a day. You could in theory adjust the flavor or mixture to your own personal preference, but I just really think it's perfect the way it is, even if it may take a bit of getting used to.

{"title": "Fried Chicken Technique I Just Invented", "selftext": "So I was testing out a few different ways to bread chicken for making a keto General Tso's, because it's my favorite (non)Chinese take-out.  This can obvi work for pretty much any kind of chicken.  \n  \nI was testing different ways to bread the chicken; just rolled in almond flour, just rolled in ground pork-rind breading, almond flour then egg/cream wash then breaded, and mayonnaise then breaded.  They all lost some of the breading in the oil, and the egg/cream and mayo clouded up the oil so I knew some was dissolving off.  \n  \nI think I hit on something special.  \n  \nIngredients  \nEggs  \nAlmond Flour  \nGround pork rinds  \n  \nA roughly 1:1:2 ratio of ground pork-rinds, almond flour, and eggs to make a batter.  Equal parts pork rinds/flour, then add eggs till the batter seems to be a proper consistency.  I'm going to test more to get proper weights, but it was roughly the same by mass eyeball wise (i.e. more egg weight than breading).  Dunk the chicken in the batter, drop in the hot oil (the batter will come off on your hands, so I used chopsticks to dunk and drop).  Pull out of the oil and put on paper towels once the batter has firmed up, let cool while doing more pieces or a batch.  Then refry, drain on paper towels again, and finally refry a third time until a nice deep golden brown.  \n  \nPulling it out and letting it cool helps the moisture fry out of the very egg-heavy batter without overcooking the chicken, and it ends up being a texture that's almost exactly what I would get when I used to do traditional General Tso's.  Going just once the batter was wet and floppy, and leaving it in till the proper color the chicken was overdone.  I was doing this with thigh meat, so you might want to only go twice with white meat.

Gently, drop in the cubes of paneer and gently toss, taking care not to break the cubes if you're using the homemade kind. Let the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped.\n* Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food processor until smooth. Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife.\n* Place a large skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so, and then remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate (optional - but do this if your paneer is crumbly).\n* Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and chile. Now here's the important part: saute the mixture until it's evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes. Don't skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water.\n* Add the garam masala, coriander and cumin. If you haven't already, sprinkle a little water to keep the spices from burning. Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cook out, and it all smells a bit more melodious, 3 to 5 minutes.\n* Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. Add a little salt and 1/2 cup of water, stir, and cook about 5 minutes with the lid off.\n* Turn the heat off. Add the yogurt, a little at a time to keep it from curdling. Once the yogurt is well mixed into the spinach, add the paneer. Turn the heat back on, cover and cook until everything is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNotes:\n\n* I typically make a double batch and use 3 serrano peppers with seeds because I enjoy spicy foods.\n* Pairs well with chicken, and flavorful enough to make even plain chicken breast tasty. Also good on its own as a main dish.\n* I once forgot to remove the paneer from the pan when I put in the onions and it all seemed fine, but maybe it's important if your paneer isn't firm.\n* If you're in Seattle, Apel Farms makes great paneer. Available at Smith Brothers and Met Market, but half the price at Smith Bros.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1i6qvhk/saag_paneer/", "created_utc": 1737487600.0, "score": 43, "author": "PBnH", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1i6qvhk/saag_paneer/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I will eat some low carb stuff but really fatty foods upset my stomach and pork is not on my diet \u2721\ufe0f and most dairy and me don't get along.\n\nHere's the issue with some turkey bacon, most of them add canola oil or other oils into the bacon itself and most also add sugar.\n\nI buy brands like Godshall at the box stores which is uncured and has no added oils or sugar. \n\nHere's the issue with bacon that has no oils added into the bacon:\n\nIf you fry them the way the package says to fry them, they don't get crispy they will turn black and get hard and taste gross.\n\nHere's my little trick to get uncured, no oil or sugar added bacon, thick or thin sliced to get crispy without turning into charcoal. \n\n**The Skillet:**\n\nUse a cast iron skillet or a heavy non-stick skillet that disperses heat evenly so you don't get undercooked pieces.\n\n**Cooking Oil:**\n\nI use avocado oil for this, butter breaks down at higher temperatures due to its lower smoke point. \n\nSpray oil or spread oil on your skillet real good,  give it a good coating but you don't want a big pool of oil.\n\n**Heat:**\n\nUse medium high heat and don't put the bacon in until the skillet is hot.\n\n**Timing:**\n\nI use a pair of tongs and flip them every couple of minutes. \n\nThey will get crispier after you take them out.\n\nIt's better to undercook them and then cook them a little more then to overcook them.\n\n**Reapply Oil:**\n\nBecause turkey bacon is a lot leaner, when it fries it will soak up the oil some and you will need to reapply oil between batches if you are frying like a 12 oz package or 40 ounce package. I fry four at a time and reapply oil each time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe boyfriend will actually eat it If I have it in the fridge and likes the texture that it is similar to \"real bacon\" in his words. \n\nThe only issue with some of the all natural ones that it is so clean with no preservatives and no artificial flavors and so on, it has a tendency to be bland so I have to add a little seasoning to it when frying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1i27rn4/to_get_crispy_turkey_bacon/", "created_utc": 1736975097.0, "score": 2, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1i27rn4/to_get_crispy_turkey_bacon/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Working on a from scratch simple almond flour chips (crisps) recipe", "selftext": "I make my own corn tortillas so I am making almond flour tortillas for the boyfriend. \n\nI thought since I can make my own tostadas, I can make them into corn chips by just adding extra sea salt and seasoning and cutting them into pieces before frying.\n\nI have an 8 inch cast iron tortilla press, aluminum ones are not as sturdy and may not give the pressure needed.\n\nUse parchment paper or wax paper, you can use parchment rounds that are cut to fit.\n\nHere's the base recipe I'm going to be starting with:\n\n* 4 oz / 113 g almond flour \n* 1/2 oz / 14 g psyllium husk\n* 1/4 tsp sea salt \n* 1/2 cup / 118 g water\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together almond flour, psyllium husk and salt.\n\n2. Add water, stir until combined. \n\n3. Rest for 5 minutes. \n\n**The dough should have the consistency of Play-Doh.**\n\nIf too thin add a little bit more almond flour, if too thick add a little bit more water and then let rest some more.\n\n4. Separate into five equal size portions which will give you 6 inch tortillas.\n\nUse smaller amounts of batter for smaller street tacos, 7 balls will give you a little over 4 inch diameter tortillas and 6 balls will give you 5 inch tortillas.\n\nI use a two tablespoon ice cream scoop which will give me roughly 5 inch tortillas.\n\n5. Place one piece of parchment or wax paper on the bottom of the press\n\n6. Take a batter portion and roll into a ball and place in the middle of the tortilla press. \n\n7. Place a parchment or wax paper piece on top of the ball and press down. \n\n8. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat until hot (If using cast iron, spray a little bit of cooking oil on it, not too much) \n\n9.

Stir in the melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract until the dough comes together.\n* Turn the dough out onto the prepared baking sheet and form into a low, flat log, about 10 x 4 inches. Bake for 25 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool for 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 250\u00baF.\n* With a large serrated knife, gently slice the log into 15 even slices. Place the slices back onto the baking sheet, cut side down, and bake for 15 minutes.\n* Flip each slice carefully and continue to bake for another 15 minutes. Turn off the oven and let them sit inside until cool. Keep your eye on them in case they brown too quickly.\n* In a shallow dish, whisk together the granulated sweetener and cinnamon. Dip the biscotti on both sides in the cinnamon mixture.\n\n# Notes\n\n**Storage Information:**\u00a0Biscotti are baked hard and dry, so they have a longer shelf life than things like keto chocolate chip cookies. You can store them in a covered container on the counter for up to a week. You can also freeze biscotti for several months.If you live in a humid environment, they may soften up as they sit. You can crisp them back up by placing them in a warm (200\u00baF) oven for 15 minutes or so, and letting them cool again.\n\n# Nutrition\n\nServing:\u00a01biscotto\u00a0|\u00a0Calories:\u00a0129kcal\u00a0|\u00a0Carbohydrates:\u00a03.9g\u00a0|\u00a0Protein:\u00a03.9g\u00a0|\u00a0Fat:\u00a011.4g\u00a0|\u00a0Fiber:\u00a01.9g\n\n**By Carolyn Ketchum of All Day I Dream About Food**Keto Biscotti Recipe\n\n\n\n[Cinnamon Keto Biscotti - All Day I Dream About Food](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/cinnamon-keto-biscotti/comment-page-1/?unapproved=296569&moderation-hash=97dad086502c7b1851d63b312dac32f8)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hgrym6/for_all_the_biscotti_lovers_out_there_doing/", "created_utc": 1734490176.0, "score": 46, "author": "aztonyusa", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hgrym6/for_all_the_biscotti_lovers_out_there_doing/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

", "selftext": "EDIT: For anyone else who reads this later, google \"warmed over flavor\" and you'll know what I mean. A kind commenter mentions this below and was a great help. No great solutions, but the consensus seems to be either encorportating citrus into cook such as lime/lemon and or masking with stronger, more flavorful spices.\n\nTLDR - what is your go-to method for meal prepping chicken?\n\nI do a basic shredded chicken recipe in the crockpot. I just do chicken, chicken broth, salt, pepper, onion, garlic. And to be clear - it tastes and smells great while cooking and right out of the pot. Day 2 and beyond, tastes fine - but always smells a bit unfresh for some reason when I reheat it. I don't mean a level of smell that indicates its rotten, nasty, spoiled, infected, improperly cooked, etc. And it's not just this batch, its a systemic thing I've noticed across many batches.\n\nI wonder if its the recipe somehow, or maybe the method - lots of moisture in there maybe just not good for multi-day reheating or something. Is it my re-heating method? I don't know.\n\nI'd like to keep doing it in the crock pot since its so fast and easy - but I need to figure out what's going on here. Its getting to a point where I'm sort of having to \"power through\" some of these meals because of this.\n\nI basically use it for chicken bowls - chicken, avacado, tomatoes, red onions, beans, eggs, etc. Any idea whats going on here, and what do you do to meal prep your chicken?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hf2ixt/meal_prepping_chicken_my_crock_pot_method_smells/", "created_utc": 1734297184.0, "score": 9, "author": "smoreofnothing22", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1hf2ixt/meal_prepping_chicken_my_crock_pot_method_smells/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Low Carb Almond Meringue Cookies ", "selftext": "Low Carb Almond Meringue Cookies \r\r\n\r\nMeringue cookies are similar to pavlovas, but they aren\u2019t supposed to have a chewy marshmallow-like interior. Instead, a properly made meringue will be dry through the center and will melt in your mouth with very little effort. The end result is light, airy, and incredibly delicious. \n\r\nTip: Eggs are easier to separate while they are still chilled. Once separated, reserve the yolks in the refrigerator for another use, if desired, and allow the whites to come to room temperature for at least 30 minutes prior to beating. \r\n\r\nPrep time: 15 minutes \r\nCook time: 2 hours 45 minutes\r\nYields: 65 small cookies (as shown)\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n4 large egg whites, room temperature\r\n\u00bd t. cream of tartar\r\n1/8 t. salt\r\n\u00be c.

Pre-heat to 200\u00b0F and line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat\u2122 baking mats. Set aside. \r\n\r\n2.\tUsing a stand or hand mixer, beat the egg whites until they start to thicken. Add the cream of tartar and salt and continue mixing until stiff peaks start to form. \r\n\r\n3.\tWhile still mixing, slowly add the Swerve, one tablespoon at a time, until each spoonful is thoroughly incorporated into the egg whites. Repeat until all the sweetener is added and the mixture becomes stiff and glossy. \r\n\r\n4.\tAdd the almond extract and mix until just incorporated into the batter. \r\n\r\n5.\tSpoon the mixture into an icing bag fitted with a decorative tip. Gently pipe the mixture onto the baking sheets to create small equal-sized cookies. Cookies may be relatively close together because they won\u2019t spread out while baking.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlace the baking sheets into the pre-heated oven for 15 minutes, then turn the oven off. Do not open the door. Leave the cookies in the warm oven for two to two-and-a-half hours without opening the door. This will give the cookies time to dry completely. \r\n\r\nTip: The cookies are ready when they easily pop off the parchment paper or Silpat\u2122 baking mats.

However, you\u2019ll want to be careful not to overcook the beef with this method. \n\r\nTip: To prepare the mushroom caps, gently remove stems by hand. Then, carefully scoop out the gills with a spoon and discard.

Add the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, if using, and the dried rosemary.

{"title": "Asian inspired sauce and soup", "selftext": "Pictured: Hot & Sour Soup fusion made with leftover chicken and leftover vegetables.\n\nLet's stop food waste!\n\n**Post has three recipes.**\n\nEach year we do a different theme for a holiday party.\n\nLast year it was Asian Fusion and I never really made Asian food except for basic stir fry or fried rice.\n\nI discovered it was super easy and even the ones that required specialty ingredients could easily be swapped out.\n\nA lot of them are also super easy to convert to low carbohydrate or sugar-free.\n\nWith ginger powder, don't get the store stuff in the shaker, you can get a 1 lb bag of organic ginger powder. Keep the bag sealed and it will retain its flavor.\n\n**Sweet And Sour Sauce**\n\nIt is simple to whip up and doesn't require any odd ingredients for a simple sweet and sour sauce that can be used as a dipping sauce or even as a glaze.\n\nI modified the recipe using an allulose / stevia blend.\n\nDo not use erythritol, it will crystallize.\n\nI used unsweetened curry ketchup, I've also made this with unsweetened Primal Kitchen Ketchup.\n\nSince I used unsweetened ketchup I added a little bit more sweetener than the recipe calls for. \n\nI mix 1 tsp stevia with 1 cup of allulose as my blend.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 3/4+ cup sugar substitute blend\n* 2/3 cup water\n* 1/3 cup white vinegar \n* 1/4 cup soy sauce\n* 1+ tsp xanthan gum or guar gum\n* 1 tbsp ketchup\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. Take your 3/4 cup sweetener and grind it to a confectioner blend in a coffee grinder or smoothie blender. \n\n2. Add all ingredients to a pot except the thickener. \n\n3. Stir together. \n\n4. Taste and add any additional sweetener.\n\n5. Slowly whisk in xanthan gum \n\n6. Bring to a slow boil and stir constantly until it starts to thicken. \n\n7. If not thick enough, slowly sprinkle and whisk additional xanthan gum. \n\nThat's it.\n\n**Notes**\n\nDoes not work with gelatin \n\nYou can use rice vinegar but it will make it a little bit sweeter tasting.\n\nIt will thicken further as it cools.\n\nStores for roughly a week in the fridge.\n\nIf you want a little bit more kick, you can sprinkle in some ginger powder.\n\nCan add 1 tsp of molasses.\n\nCan add more ketchup If it is too weak.\n\nCan use sweetened ketchup like Heinz Sugar Free Ketchup, just add the recipe amount.\n\n**Egg Drop Soup**\n\nThis is a simple recipe that took just a little tinkering.\n\nIt does not have any hard to source ingredients.\n\nIf you want to make your own garlic salt:\n\n3 parts garlic powder to 1 part salt, I make mine with Himalayan pink salt.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 32 oz chicken broth or chicken bone broth \n* 3 large eggs\n* 1/2 to 1 tsp xanthan or guar gum\n* 1 tsp ground ginger\n* 1/4 tsp garlic salt\n* 1/8 to 1/4 tsp black pepper (I use 1/4 tsp) \n* 3 green onions (thin sliced)\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. Whisk eggs and set aside\n\n2. In a pot, add chicken broth and slowly whisk in xanthan gum. \n\n3. Add ground ginger, garlic salt, black pepper.\n\n4. If too thin, slowly whisk in more xanthan gum.\n\n5. Bring to a boil while stirring and add green onions and continue stirring.\n\n6. Bring to a roaring boil.\n\n7. Use a non slotted spoon, stir the soup in clockwise or counterclockwise circles, do not change the stirring direction.\n\n8. While stirring in circles, slowly add the eggs. The eggs will cook while you are stirring.\n\n9. Turn off the heat and enjoy, don't overcook the eggs.\n\n**Notes**\n\nCan add additional vegetables or protein, after step 2, add your ingredients and let it simmer until the vegetables or protein get to desired tenderness.\n\nTop with additional green onion.\n\nI like to add a little bit of fresh ginger slivers into the soup when I add the green onion.\n\n**Hot And Sour Soup**\n\nThis is another simple soup that I like to make when I have leftover vegetables or leftover meat and I want to avoid food waste.\n\nBecause I throw in leftover vegetables it's not traditional. \n\nI will include a traditional recipe and then you can add or subtract whatever to your taste.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 64 oz chicken or vegetable broth (or bone broth)\n* 8 oz shiitake mushrooms thinly sliced\n* 8 oz can bamboo shoots (drained) \n* 1/4+ cup rice wine vinegar \n* 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce \n* 2+ tsp ground ginger \n* 1+ tsp chilli garlic sauce\n* 1+ tsp xanthan or guar gum \n* 2 large eggs (whisked) \n* 8 oz firm tofu cut into 1/2 inch cubes\n* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil \n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Ingredient substitution**\n\n* Can use baby bella mushrooms for shiitake mushrooms.\n* Can use white vinegar for rice vinegar but it will make it a little more sour. \n* Can use regular soy sauce but will make it more saltier.\n* Can use Sriracha sauce or red pepper flakes and minced garlic instead of chili garlic sauce \n* Can use extra firm tofu \n* Can substitute avocado oil or peanut oil for toasted sesame oil\n* Can add a little tahini or a bagel seasoning with the avocado or peanut oil.\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. In a large stock pot, sprinkle in and whisk xanthan gum with 64 oz broth.\n\n2. Add mushrooms, bamboo shoots, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and chili garlic sauce.\n\n3. Heat over medium high heat while stirring until it reaches a simmer. \n\n4. If too thin, sprinkle and whisk more xanthan gum. Stir soup in a circular motion.\n\n5. Continue stirring the soup in a circular motion, then drizzle in the eggs in a thin stream (while still stirring the soup) to create egg ribbons.\n\n6. Stir in the tofu, sesame oil and half of the green onions.\n\n7. Add additional salt and pepper for taste. \n\n8. If you\u2019d like a more \u201csour\u201d soup, add in another tablespoon or two of rice wine vinegar as well.\n\n9.  If you like a spicier soup, add in more chili garlic sauce.\n\n10. Garnish with additional green onions and serve immediately. \n\nCan eat as is or serve on cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nWhat I added to the soup in the picture: \n\n* Was out of bamboo shoots so it was omitted. \n* Used regular white mushrooms. \n* Since I'm sick, I wanted it very spicy. I used red pepper flakes, cayenne powder and jarred minced garlic in water (drained).\n* Used 2 tbsp ginger powder.\n* I used dark soy sauce.\n* Used 1 tsp avocado oil + 1 tsp bagel seasoning.\n* Used fresh vegetables that I had in the fridge. \n* Used leftover chicken breast.\n\nServed on cauliflower rice.\n\n**How to add fresh vegetables**\n\nAfter I added the 64 oz of chicken stock and whisked in the xanthan gum, I added my fresh vegetables\n\nI let it simmer for an hour until the vegetables were al dente.\n\nAfter that I continued with step 2.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/9bfdn9iq0x5e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1733790309.0, "score": 18, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1haow9p/asian_inspired_sauce_and_soup/", "html_title": ""}

However, this method can cause \u2018hot spots\u2019 (and unevenly cooked eggs), particularly when using a gas cooktop.

Partially cover the skillet with a lid until the cheese starts to melt and the egg is mostly cooked through, approximately 2-3 minutes.\r\n\r\n6.\tRemove the lid and carefully flip half the omelet on top of the other half with a spatula.

{"title": "Parmigiana bianca di zucchine (courgettes)", "selftext": "\u2022 For 4 people:\n\n-4 courgettes\n-200g sliced \u200b\u200bham (I bought turkey ham from the butcher)\n-250g smoked scarmoza (failing that provolone or dry mozzarella, smoked preferably) cut into slices\n-80g parmesan\n-Supplement : a little mozzarella for gratin, if you want\n-1 drizzle of olive oil\n\n-Slice the courgettes lengthwise with a mandolin or a good peeler (or by hand, as long as the slices are very thin, 1mm).\n\nDrain them in a colander with a good pinch of salt, mix and let drain for at least 30min.\n\n -Remove the excess water released by the courgettes without wringing them out or pressing them too hard so that they do not break. Absorb the excess water again by spreading them on absorbent paper and then putting more absorbent paper on top. \n\n-Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. \n\n-In a baking dish, brush with a little oil using a brush or paper towel. Place a first layer of courgettes, tightly packed (you should not see through) vertically. \n\n-Put a layer of ham everywhere but without covering completely. \n\n-Put a layer of scarmoza in the same way. \n\n-Sprinkle with grated parmesan. Cover but without making a thickness, you should see through. \n\n If you put a cream or something else like ricotta, put it between the ham and the cheeses, in a very thin layer, if there is too much it will be sickening. (but I am French of Italian origin and if the French put b\u00e9chamel or cream, I assure you that the Italians will not do it and will be offended! lol)\n\n-Add another layer of courgettes, this time in the other direction, horizontally. \n\n-Continue until you run out of ingredients. Finish with a layer of courgettes and a little parmesan and mozzarella (pizza mozzarella because the courgettes will already release water. If you put fresh, you will have to cut it, put it on a plate and let it dry for 1 or 2 days in the fridge). \n\n-Cover the dish (if your oven browns quickly) and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the lid or the heat for the last 10 minutes so that it browns. It's ready!

{"title": "Pumpkin spice lattee+ chocolate mint latte", "selftext": "Forgot to put this on yesterday. \n\nThis yields 24 oz, can adjust for taste and portion size and intensity.\n\nHow I brew my coffee so it doesn't get the graininess of the pumpkin pie spice or graininess of the cocoa powder is I use a 12 cup stovetop percolator for this (My normal coffee making method is pour over with a Chemix).\n\nYes the periculator is oversized for just making 24 oz of coffee but you're also adding pumpkin pie spice or a few tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder.\n\nI'll include instructions at the bottom how to use a percolator if you've never used one.\n\nI also put the mint extract into the water before brewing because mint extract can go from nice flavor to sickening overpowering with just a couple of drops and this helps it from overpowering.\n\n**Pumpkin Spice Latte*\"\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nCoffee:\n\n* 24 oz (750 ml) brewed strong coffee\n* 2 to 3 tbsp canned pumpkin puree \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 1 - 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n* 2+ cups (1/2+ literl) dairy or non-dairy (I mix almond milk with some heavy whipping cream)\n* Sweetener of choice\n\nOptional topping:\n\n* 1 cup (237 ml) heavy whipping cream \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n* 2 tbsp sweetener\n* Cinnamon or nutmeg or pumpkin spice.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nIf using a percolator: \n\n1. Add water to percolator \n2. Add coffee and pumpkin pie spice to the basket \n3. Brew and add a few minutes of brewing time to make it extra strong. \n4. After brewing, add coffee, vanilla extract, milk, sweetener and pumpkin puree to a pot.\n5. Heat on medium and stir until dissolved. \n\nIf you're not using a percolator: \n\n1. Brew coffee like you normally would, use a little bit extra coffee when brewing because you want this strong. \n\n2. Follow the instructions above but add the pumpkin pie spice to the pot along with the other ingredients.\n\n3. You'll need to stir more so that the pumpkin pie spice does not become grainy.\n\nPour and enjoy!\n\nFor an extra treat:\n\n1.After making your pumpkin spice latte, instead of pouring into cups, cover and simmer to keep warm. \n2. Whisk together heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. \n3. Pour the coffee into cups, top with the homemade whipped topping. Dust it with a little bit of cinnamon or nutmeg or pumpkin spice. \n\nEnjoy! \n\n**Chocolate mint latte**\n\nBe careful with this one because a little mint extract tastes good but too much and it overpowers it and it becomes sickening mint so use a few drops at a time!\n\nI also do this in a percolator since I use unsweetened cocoa powder which can be very grainy if not done correctly.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nCoffee:\n\n* 24 oz (750 ml) brewed strong coffee\n* Peppermint extract **do not use more than 1/4 tsp**\n* 3 to 4 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n* 2+ cups (1/2+ liter) dairy or non-dairy milk (I mix almond milk with some heavy whipping cream) \n* Sweetener of choice\n\nOptional topping: \n\n* 1 cup (237 ml)l heavy whipping cream \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n* 2 tbsp sweetener \n* Sugar-free starlight mints\n\n**Preparation**\n\nIf using a percolator:\n\n1. Add water and mint extract to the percolator, I use 1/4 tsp of mint extract.\n2. Add ground coffee and cocoa powder to the basket. \n3. Give it a few minutes extra brewing time to make it stronger. \n4. In a pot, add brewed coffee milk and sweetener, stir, put it on medium until it gets to the right temperature you want. \n\nIf you're not using a percolator: \n\n1. Brew coffee as you normally would, you might have to add extra coffee because you want it strong.\n2. In a pot, add brewed coffee, milk, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, sweetener and mint extract **add a couple of drops at a time, It will easily overpower it !!**\n3. Set stove to medium and stir (You're going to have to stir and stir and stir so that the cocoa powder is not grainy).\n\nPour and enjoy!\n\nOr you can add the topping:\n\nInstead of buying expensive shredded sugar-free mints, I take a few starlight mints, put them under some plastic wrap and smash them with a hammer until they have turned into powder.\n\n1. Whisk together heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. \n2. Pour into cups and top with the whip topping.\n3. Dust with the powdered starlight mints.\n\nPour and enjoy!\n\n**About percolators**\n\nThe difference between a percolator and a drip coffee maker like what you have at work is a percolator reruns the water through the coffee grinds over and over again. \n\nIt can go from strong to bitter or burnt easily if you are not careful. \n\nBecause it cycles it over and over and over again it makes for a stronger cup and can extract out the pumpkin pie spice and cocoa powder without the graininess. \n\nI use a 12 cup percolator and this is how I set it. \n\nFor 24 oz / 750 ml I use 6 tbsp ground coffee (not using exact weight because whole bean coffee weight varies).\n\nUse a medium grind coffee.\n\nI would recommend using a disc filter that goes into the percolator basket that will help with coffee grinds, you could also just punch a hole in a regular basket filter (that's what I do).\n\nWhen you're ready to brew, put it on your stove on high, as soon as coffee starts gurgling into the clear dome on the top, reduce heat to halfway between low and medium I do mine at 3.\n\nHere's the trick, you want it to percolate and still see coffee coming up into the dome but you don't want it boiling but you don't want it so low that it stops percolating. \n\nSo after you reduce the heat that's when your brewing time starts, I do it for about 10 minutes, some people want it a little bit lighter  and use less time and some people want it super strong almost like tar and do it for as much as 15 minutes.\n\nIf you are using dark roast coffee, It will take a little less time.\n\nLight roast or blond roast is not recommended.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/581xkqyigo3e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1732814958.0, "score": 12, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1h213a2/pumpkin_spice_lattee_chocolate_mint_latte/", "html_title": ""}

I get roughly 6 lb / 2.72 kg for $3.49 USD.\n\nHere's the method that I use, I combined a couple of them to what works for me. \n\n1. Wash and pat dry a head of cauliflower.\n2. Set it somewhere to let dry for a couple hours. \n3. Cut off the end and the dark green leaves. \n4.. Cut it into quarters or manageable chunks. \n5. Either use a box grater (see images) or a food processor with a shredder blade that's used for coleslaw (I use the shredder blade)\n6. Shred your cauliflower into rice (I use as much of the stalk as possible, see notes).\n7. Place your cauliflower rice in a large mesh strainer, If the holes are big, line with a paper towel. \n8. Let it rest for an hour or so while rotating the cauliflower rice to get as much water out as possible. \n9.. Use a food scale and measure out your portion size (I use 12 oz / 340.2 g)\n10. Put into sous vide bags. Triple check the bags to make sure that they are completely sealed.\n11. Lay flat in the freezer. \n12. Once frozen, give it a shake and pump out all of the air.\n\nThis will last for months.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe entire cauliflower is edible. \n\nIf you use further down the stalk It will become more of a cabbage like flavor versus the florets but I use it and when you cook it and season it it doesn't taste like cabbage also helps with food waste since you're not throwing out as much cauliflower. \n\nIf you don't like making the salk into rice because you think it's too fibrous or cabbage flavor, save it and use it for other dishes, just bag and freeze.\n\nThe lighter colored green leaves can be used in dishes that require cabbage.\n\n**Food Storage**\n\nI like working with sous vide bags (see images).\n\nUnlike traditional vacuum seal bags you don't have to cut them and reseal them, they are like vacuum sealed Ziploc bags that you just bleach and reuse. Bag kits also come with spare valves so you just peel off the old valve put the new valve on and it's ready to go again.\n\nSo there is less plastic waste. \n\nI prefer a manual pump versus a battery pump since just a slightest amount of liquid will ruin the vacuum and some of them don't suck good.\n\nAlso if you buy lots of mozzarella and other cheese for chaffles and other uses, a 5 lb bag of shredded mozzarella will last for months after it's been vacuum sealed though you will have to shred up the cheese. \n\nA block of sharp cheddar will last for months after it's been cut up and vacuum sealed fresh soft mozzarella will double the life in the fridge just use caution when pumping it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gz4kd0", "created_utc": 1732490369.0, "score": 23, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gz4kd0/just_started_making_my_own_cauliflower_rice_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I tried it with it and it ruined the whole dish.)\n\u2022 1/2 cup fresh shredded Gruyere cheese (divided evenly among thighs)\n\u2022 2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese (divided evenly among thighs)\n\u2022 1 tbsp finely chopped chives\n\n\nInstructions:\nSous Vide the Chicken (Preferred Method):\n1. Preheat your sous vide water bath to\n165\u00b0F.\n2. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.\n3. Place the chicken thighs in a vacuum-seal bag or a resealable zip-top bag using the water displacement method.\n4. Cook in the water bath for 2 hours.\n5. Once done, remove the thighs from the bag and pat them dry with paper towels to prepare for searing.\nAlternative Method (Non-Sous Vide):\n\u2022 Cook the chicken using your preferred method (e.g., oven, skillet, or air fryer), but ensure the thighs are fully cooked to 165\u00b0F.\nA good sear on the chicken is crucial for flavor.\n\n2. Sear the Chicken:\n1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil or PAM.\n2. Sear the thighs for 1-2 minutes per side until a golden-brown crust forms. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n3. Assemble the Layers:\n1. Spread 1 tbsp of mayonnaise evenly over the top of each chicken thigh.\n2. Layer the shredded Gruyere evenly on top of the mayo.\n3. Sprinkle the grated Parmesan over the Gruyere for a final cheesy layer.\n4. Top with a pinch of fresh chives.\n\n4. Crisp and Finish:\n\u2022 Air Fryer Method (Preferred for Crispiness):\n\u2022 Preheat the air fryer to 375\u00b0F. Place the thighs in the basket and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling.\n\u2022 Oven Method:\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Place the thighs on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes, finishing under the broiler for 2-3 minutes to brown the cheese. Be careful not to burn the cheese.\n5. Serve:\n\u2022 Let the chicken rest for 2-3 minutes after crisping. Garnish with additional chives if desired and serve immediately.\n\nNotes:\n\u2022 Sous Vide for Precision: Sous vide ensures perfectly cooked chicken with juicy, tender meat. However, this recipe works with any cooking method as long as the chicken is seared to achieve a crust.\n\u2022 Layering Matters: Layering Gruyere and Parmesan separately creates a richer texture and allows each cheese to shine. The grated Parmesan helps with the melting and crisping.\n\u2022 Keto-Friendly Pairing Ideas: Serve with roasted vegetables, cauliflower mash, Brussels sprouts, or saut\u00e9ed spinach for a complete low-carb meal.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxcub1", "created_utc": 1732295513.0, "score": 39, "author": "nicksaiz65", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gxcub1/mayo_gruyere_chive_chicken_thighs/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Carnivore Mashed \u201cPotatoes\u201d", "selftext": "Some (genius IMO) guy named Chris came up with this. Cauliflower rice or mash don't work for me. Like a shark can smell blood from up to a quarter of a mile away, the merest hint of cauli in a dish overwhelms it for me. This is different. When paired with meat or gravy, I can ***almost*** imagine I'm eating actual whipped potatoes. The secret is to cook it super slow and let it out-gas in the refrigerator before covering it to reduce the amount of sulfur scent (which is minimal if you make it right).\n\n[Link to video](https://youtu.be/E6vuPpXqu9A?si=uzE45a3IsKN2g4vY)\n\n=====================================================================\n\nCarnivore Mashed \u201cPotatoes\u201d Recipe:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIngredients\n\n1 stick butter (1/2 Cup, or 8 Tbsp)\n\n32 oz egg whites (25-30 whites)\n\n1/2 tsp salt\n\n1/8 tsp garlic powder (optional)\n\n2 oz cream cheese\n\n2-3 oz fresh mozzarella\n\n1 tsp Parmesan cheese\n\n2 Tbsp sour cream\n\n2 tsp toasted beef gelatin\n\n1 Tbsp regular beef gelatin\n\n1/2 tsp white pepper (optional)\n\n1-2 Tbsp egg white powder\n\nHeavy cream for blending as needed\n\n  \n\n\nMacros For Whole Recipe (Suggest 6-8 Servings Per Recipe)\n\n2018 Cal\n\n151 fat\n\n13 carbs\n\n145 protein\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMethod\n\nMelt butter over medium/low heat in non-stick skillet. Add egg whites, salt, and optional garlic powder. Scramble egg whites breaking up into small pieces while stirring. Continue cooking egg whites until all liquid has dried up in the pan leaving crumbly eggs and residual butter fat. Use low heat to avoid browning the eggs. Remove from heat and leave in skillet to stay warm monetarily.\n\nAdd cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan, sour cream, toasted gelatin, plain gelatin, and optional white pepper to blender. Add hot eggs on top. Turn blender on low. Using pusher through open hole in lid, continue encouraging egg mix to blend. If no lid opening and/or pusher is available, stop blender frequently and use a spatula or other tool to pop air bubble and continue blending. If mixture is too dry to blend add heavy cream 2-3 Tbsp at a time and continue pushing mixture down into blender blades until mixture starts to blend. Use as little cream as possible to make this happen. Slowly increase speed to high if adjustable. If not, increase in whatever increments available until blending on high. Mixture should readily flow into blades and blend but should remain as thick and dry as possible.\n\nOnce mixture becomes a smooth cohesive blended mix taste for salt. Add more if you wish. Then add egg white powder on top and blend well into mixture. Stop blender, stir to ensure there are no lumps or dry powder and blend again on high for 10-20 seconds. Remove mixture to serving bowl.\n\nIf desired, top mash with more melted butter, seasonings, bacon and sour cream, or whatever toppings you like on mashed potatoes. Serge immediately.\n\nIf cooking with these mashed potatoes (i.e. shepherds pie, etc.), do not add egg white powder at the end as this will set the potatoes firmly if cooked further.\n\nTo reheat leftover mash, heat 30 seconds at a time, stirring well each time, until hot. Use hot cream and/or melted butter as necessary to keep the mixture smooth. You may also consider adding them back to a blender to get the texture right again. Stir well and serve.\n\nIf you intend to make them ahead of time and then reheat them, leave out the egg white powder and only add a little if necessary to get the texture you want before serving however much you have reheated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gtoh18/carnivore_mashed_potatoes/", "created_utc": 1731879673.0, "score": 21, "author": "crustyloaves", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1gtoh18/carnivore_mashed_potatoes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Do not allow to smoke. Remove chiles to a 2 quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl, set aside. (Alternatively, place dried chiles on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until pliable and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a 2-quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl.) Add half of chicken broth and chipotle chiles and their sauce, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high power until gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from microwave and set aside for 5 minutes. Transfer chiles and liquid to blender and blend, starting on the lowest possible setting and gradually increasing speed to high (make sure to hold the lid down with a clean kitchen towel or a potholder to prevent it from blowing out). Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.\n\nSeason beef cubes generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in the base of a Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add half of the beef cubes in a single layer and cook until deeply browned on a single side, about 3 minutes. Remove from pot, set aside with remaining unseared beef.\n\nReturn Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently until translucent and softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, and if using, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, and oregano, and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add all meat (seared and non-seared) and accumulated juices back to pan along with chile pur\u00e9e, stir to combine.\n\nBring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cover, leaving lid just barely ajar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is completely tender, about 3 hours. (Check sauce levels occasionally; if sauce gets too thick, add 1/4 cup water or stock until desired consistency is reached). Once sauce has thickened to desired consistency, cover completely for the remainder of cook time. Alternatively, chili can be cooked in a 200\u00b0 to 250\u00b0F (95\u00b0 to 120\u00b0C) oven with the lid of the Dutch oven slightly ajar.\n\nStir in optional fish sauce, and vinegar.

For some people it might be too oniony.\n\nThere is one problem you have to be careful with.\n\nBecause it has a lot of onion and no preservatives or artificial ingredients, it can start to ferment and puff up in the container very fast.\n\nAfter buying you need to go straight home with it or put it in a cooler with ice packs or ice or it will go bad very fast. \n\n* Costco - Jack's Organic Cantina Salsa\n\n3 net carb per 2 tbsp, medium heat salsa. Has the most tomato flavor. Does have sugar and potassium sorbate (a preservative) .\n\nI like this one for a medium spicy salsa but it does have artificial ingredients and sugar.\n\n* Sam's Club - Member's Mark Cilantro Pico De Gallo Style Salsa\n\n1 net carb per 2 tbsp. Has a strong cilantro flavor. \n\nThe problem with this one is this one has the most amount of liquid which is what lowers the carbohydrate count.\n\nContains xanthan gum, lactic acid, phosphoric acid and food coloring. \n\nI like all three of them, I like the Wellesley Farms one the most but it spoils the fastest.\n\nIf you're good at making your own salsa, that is always the best and you're lucky you have the time to make it, If you make a homemade salsa, make sure to let it set overnight to absorb flavors. \n\n**The chips**\n\n**Pork rinds**\n\nUse plain unflavored pork rinds, they make a good scoop style chip. \n\nPork rinds work good with the sour cream based sauces and with salsa.\n\nFlavored pork rinds have sugar and they also have MSG.\n\nBest place for pork rinds is Sam's Club or Aldi or Walmart.\n\n**Veggies**\n\nI use a mandoline and make squash chips, they are perfect for dipping in your sour cream based dips.\n\nCelery sticks works best with the sour cream based dips.\n\nCauliflower and broccoli florets works best  with the sour cream based dips.\n\n**Low carb wraps**\n\nSprinkle with some sea salt and bake in an oven or heat up in a skillet until hard and break into crackers. \n\nWorks best with cream sour cream based dips.

After brewing the coffee, add coffee to a pot, add unsweetened almond milk, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice (use more or less vanilla and pumpkin pie spice to taste), pumpkin puree (use more or less to taste, some people like it with no pumpkin puree) add sweetener to taste.\n\n2. Heat on medium heat and stir until it is well mixed and the pumpkin pie spice has dissolved or it will be grainy.\n\n3. Pour into cups and enjoy.\n\n**Optional topping:**\n\nFor the topping I make a sugar-free whipped topping. \n\n1. Instead of pouring coffee into cups, cover and put the stove on low so it won't burn and keeps it warm.\n\n2. In a bowl, add heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract. The amount of vanilla extract and sweeteners up to individual taste.\n\n3. Whisk until peaks start to form.\n\n4. Sprinkling a tiny bit of xanthan gum (optional)\n\n5. Continue whisking until stiff peaks form.\n\n6. Pour coffee into cups, top with whip topping, sprinkle with optional pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon or nutmeg etc.\n\n7. Enjoy.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThis works with medium roast or dark roast coffee, I prefer it with a darker roast. \n\nThis doesn't work with a blonde roast or light roast because it will overpower the coffee and you won't even taste it.\n\nI put a little xanthan gum in my whipped topping because I use heavy whipping cream that does not have binders and it will start to separate immediately with the hot coffee.\n\n**For espresso brewing**\n\nBrew a few shots of espresso, add the coffee a little at a time into the almond milk mixture until you get the taste and consistency you want.\n\n**My preferred method**\n\nMy usual method for morning coffee is pour over or mocha pot but for coffee drinks like this I use a 12 cup stove top percolator.\n\nI make 24 oz coffee.\n\nI use roughly 26 oz of water to 6 tbsp coffee after grinding and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.\n\nInstead of putting the pumpkin pie spice into the almond milk mixture, I put it directly in with the coffee grinds and mix it in before brewing.\n\nThat way it is not grainy. I add five extra minutes of brewing time. I brew it in a way it doesn't get bitter even with the extra time so I don't have to use extra coffee.\n\nOne of my supervisor, she will add the pumpkin pie spice and extra coffee into her basket with her 12 cup Mr Coffe.\n\nBoyfriend uses 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice and 3 tbsp pumpkin puree to 24 oz coffee.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1g5jz6q/pumpkin_spice_latte/", "created_utc": 1729143977.0, "score": 12, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1g5jz6q/pumpkin_spice_latte/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Keto Bourbon Anabolic French Toast Casserole", "selftext": "Recipe adapted from Joshua Weissman. \n\nKeto Bourbon Anabolic French Toast\nCasserole\n\nDescription:\nThis Keto Bourbon Anabolic French Toast Casserole combines the rich, warm flavors of bourbon, cinnamon, and lightly sweetened custard with the satisfying texture of keto-friendly Hawalian bread.\nThe custard soaks deeply into the bread, creating a soft yet structured casserole that puffs up beautifully in the oven. Topped with fresh berries, Cool Whip, and a light dusting of powdered Swerve, this dish delivers an indulgent feel while keeping it keto and packed with protein. Perfect for those aiming to hit their macros without sacrificing flavor or texture.\n\nIngredients (Makes 1 OMAD Serving)\n\u2022 8 slices Hawaiian Keto Bread (from\nWalmart, ~45 calories per slice)\n\n\u2022 3 whole eggs\n\u2022 \u00bd cup cartoned egg whites (120ml)\n\u2022 6g cinnamon (2 tsp)\n\u2022 0.6g nutmeg \n\u2022 0.6g allspice (\u00bc tsp)\n\u2022 3g fine sea salt (\u00bd tsp)\n\u2022 48g Swerve or Brown Sugar Swerve (/4\ncup, granular)\n\u2022 1 cup half & half (240ml)\n\u2022 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or Fairlife milk for more protein, 240ml)\n\u2022 15ml bourbon (1 tbsp)\n\u2022 1 cup Walmart Frozen Mixed Berries\n(140g, thawed)\n\u2022 Cool Whip (regular, 1 serving = 2 tbsp or 9g)\n\u2022 Powdered Swerve for dusting (through a fine mesh strainer)\n\u2022 Sugar-Free Ms. Buttersworth or\nWalmart syrup (optional for serving)\n\nInstructions\n1. Prep the Bread:\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C).\n\u2022 Place the slices of keto bread in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for\n10-15 minutes until lightly toasted and dried out. This helps the bread absorb the custard without getting soggy.\n2. Make the Custard:\n\u2022 In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, cartoned egg whites, cinnamon, optional nutmeg and allspice, sea salt, and Swerve or Brown Sugar Swerve until well combined.\n\u2022 Add the half & half, almond milk, and bourbon, and whisk until smooth.\n\n3. Assemble the Casserole:\n\u2022 Generously coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\n\u2022 Arrange the bread so it's shingled in two rows in the baking dish, with each slice slightly overlapping, ensuring everything fits snugly.\n\u2022 Pour the custard mixture evenly over the bread, making sure every slice is well-soaked. Gently press the bread into the custard if needed to ensure it absorbs well.\n\u2022 Cover the dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate for a minimum of 45 minutes, or overnight if prepping ahead.\n4. Bake:\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n\u2022 Bake the covered casserole for 25-30 minutes.\n\u2022 After 25-30 minutes, remove the foil. The edges of the bread should be crispy: if not, put the foil back until it is. After that, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional\n5-10 minutes until the top is lightly golden and springs back to the touch.\n\n5. Thaw the Frozen Mixed Berries:\n\u2022 Option 1: Microwave Thawing\n\u2022 Place the frozen berries in a microwave-safe bowl.\n\u2022 Microwave on defrost or low power (50%) for 30 seconds.\n\u2022 Stir the berries and continue microwaving in 15-20 second intervals, stirring each time, until fully thawed (about 1 minute total).\n\u2022 Option 2: Fridge Thawing\n\u2022 Place the frozen berries in a bowl in the fridge.\n\u2022 Let them thaw for 4-6 hours or overnight.\n\n6. Serve:\n\u2022 Let the casserole cool for 5 minutes.\n\u2022 Top with 1 cup of thawed Walmart\nFrozen Mixed Berries and 1-2 servings of Cool Whip (9-18g).\n\u2022 Lightly dust the top with powdered Swerve using a fine mesh strainer to give it a beautiful, powdered sugar look.\n\u2022 Serve with Ms. Buttersworth or\nWalmart sugar-free syrup on the side or drizzled on top for added sweetness.\nFlavors:\n\u2022 The bourbon gives a warm, smoky note that complements the subtle sweetness of the cinnamon and Swerve.\n\u2022 The custard is creamy and rich, perfectly soaked into the keto bread, creating a soft yet satisfying texture.\n\u2022 Topped with tangy berries and cool whipped cream, the dish balances flavors and textures, making it a delicious, indulgent keto meal with none of the guilt.\n\nNUTRITIONAL INFO:\nCalories: 1,550\nProtein: 120 G\nFat: 75 G\nNet Carbs: 35 G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/1jvjjjr2m6sd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1727804574.0, "score": 54, "author": "nicksaiz65", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1ftu5k3/keto_bourbon_anabolic_french_toast_casserole/", "html_title": ""}

Put water and nut butter into your shaker and shake the hell out of it for several minutes. \n\n2. If you don't want any nut granules in it, strain it.\n\n3. If you're straining it, return it back to the shaker.\n\n4. You can add a pinch of salt, 1/4 tsp or so vanilla extract, sweetener etc. for flavor.\n\n5. Shake some more. \n\nYou need to use nut butter with the only ingredient being nuts (no sugar, salt or oils added)\n\nCan also use peanut butter or peanut powder, just make sure the only ingredient is roasted nuts.\n\nThe second method is a little bit more detailed and takes longer. \n\nUse 1/4 cup almond flour per 1 cup water.\n\n1. Put almond flour and water into the protein shaker.\n\n2. Shake it vigorously for quite a while since you're not using an electric blender. \n\nYou're going to end up with an arm workout with this one. \n\n3. Strain it twice through a fine mesh strainer. \n\n4. If you want more flavor, return it to the shaker and add a pinch of salt, 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract, sweetener etc. and shake some more. \n\nIt's not going to have the same texture and flavor as store-bought almond milk or soaking almonds overnight and running them through a blender. \n\nThe first method will give you more of a roasted nut flavor.

Press the crust down into the pie pan or springboard pan.\n5. In a mixing bowl, add sweetener, cream cheese, vanilla extract and 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream.\n6. Use a mixer and mix until just blended.\n7. Add 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream, add juice and zest and until blended, taste, add any additional zest and juice until you get the taste you want.\n8. Add any thickener.\n9. Mix until well blended.\n10. Scoop into the pie pan or springboard pan and level it.\n11. Put in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours for it to set.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nUnlike some store-bought key lime pies, I don't add food coloring so it doesn't look avocado green.\n\nI used allulose sweetener.\n\nI used 3 packs of Philadelphia cream cheese (8 oz packs).\n\nI used BJ's Wholesale Club heavy whipping cream. It has no binders or stabilizers and limited thickeners.\n\nUse both juice and zest because the zest has less carbs and will make it more spiky.\n\nThe amount of juice and zest that you use is up to individual taste, some people want it more tart some people want it more sweet.\n\nWest Indian limes (key limes) are more tart, I use roughly a little over 1 tbsp and a little over a half a cup juice after I squeezed them. Key limes are also called West Indian limes or Mexican bartender limes, so skip buying \"authentic key limes\" and look for those.\n\nDon't buy ungodly expensive zest, get a zester or a very fine grater and make your own. It's just the shiny part of the skin of the fruit.\n\nDon't buy confectioner sweeteners, If you have a coffee grinder or a blender with a grinding blade just pour your granulated sweetener in and make it yourself for half the cost.\n\nThis can be made with any lemon or lime and even a blend of lemon lime.\n\nA trick with lemons and limes, to get the most juice out, put it in the microwave for 15 seconds before cutting and squeezing and zesting.\n\nIf you want more of a toasted graham cracker crust, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F, bake the crust for 5 minutes or so, you can also lightly toast it in a skillet. Let it cool before scooping in the filling.\n\nBecause I used cream cheese and heavy whipping cream without thickeners or binders I added 1/2 tsp xanthan gum so the pie won't separate, If you don't use gum, you can bloom some gelatin and then add that mixture to the pie filling.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/4pvqrm93gtqd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1727209323.0, "score": 42, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1fomcy9/lemon_or_lime_no_bake_cheesecake/", "html_title": ""}

Adjust the strength according to your taste. If you don\u2019t have an espresso machine, you can use strong brewed coffee as a substitute.\n2. **Heat the Coconut Milk:**\n   * Pour 1 cup of unsweetened coconut milk into a small pot and heat over medium heat, or warm it in the microwave until it's hot but not boiling. If you prefer a smoother latte, use a whisk or milk frother to create a small amount of foam.\n3. **Add Healthy Fats:**\n   * If you want to increase the healthy fat content, add 1 teaspoon of MCT oil or coconut oil to the warmed coconut milk. Stir well to combine.\n4. **Sweeten to Taste:**\n   * Add 1-2 teaspoons of sweetener to the heated coconut milk according to your taste. For a vanilla flavor, you can also add 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\n5. **Combine Coffee and Coconut Milk:**\n   * Pour the brewed espresso into a cup, then slowly add the heated coconut milk. Stir gently to mix the coffee and coconut milk together.\n6. **Garnish and Enjoy:**\n   * If you like, sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon on top for garnish. Then, enjoy your creamy and rich keto coconut milk latte!\n\n# Tips:\n\n* **Substitutions:** If you don\u2019t like coconut milk, you can substitute with unsweetened almond milk or another low-carb plant-based milk, but make sure it fits within keto guidelines.\n* **Flavor Adjustments:** Adjust the ratio of coffee to coconut milk based on your preference for a stronger or milder latte.\n* **Iced Version:** For a cold drink, substitute espresso with cold brew coffee, and use chilled coconut milk to create an iced coconut milk latte.\n\nThis keto coconut milk latte is both simple and delicious, making it an ideal choice for those on a keto diet. It provides energy and satisfies your coffee cravings without disrupting ketosis.

In a microwave safe bowl melt the butter. \n2. In a mixing bowl add the dry ingredients \n3. Stir them together real good \n4. Mix in the melted butter, make sure to break up any large pieces \n5. Spray the bottom of the pie pan with oil\n6. Gently pour in the mixture into the pie pan\n7. Gently press in the crust batter, Make sure that the crust is even.\n\nOptional: I baked mine at 350\u00b0F for 5 minutes in a preheated oven to give it more of a graham cracker like texture. \n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 2 packs room temperature cream cheese \n* 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream \n* 1 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix) \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n*  2/3 cups confectionery sweetener (I made brown sugar allulose) see notes\n* 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n* Xanthan gum (see notes)\n\n1. In a mixing bowl, add 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream plus the sweetener and mix it until blended\n2. Break your cream cheese into chunks so it will be easier to mix and add it\n3. Mix on low until smooth \n4. Add remaining ingredients including optional thickener\n5. Mix on low until smooth\n6. Spoon in batter into the prepared pie pan\n7. Even the batter and let refrigerate at least 6 hours (I do mine overnight) \n\n**Optional topping:**\n\nAfter your cheesecake has set and it is ready to serve, I top mine with a little bit of homemade keto whipped topping and sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon on it. \n\n**Notes**\n\n**Xanthan gum**\n\nThe original recipe uses cream cheese and heavy whipping cream that has ingredients like polysorbate 80, mono and diglycerides, carrageenan and other binding agents. \n\nI use Philadelphia brand cream cheese or organic valley cream cheese.\n\nI use BJ's Wholesale Club or organic valley heavy whipping cream. \n\nThose have minimal binders and the cheesecake will separate and start to liquefy. \n\nAdd 1/4 tsp at a time of xanthan gum or thickener of choice until you get a texture that you like.\n\n**Sweetener**\n\nIf you have a blender with a grinding blade or a coffee grinder, it is much cheaper to make your own confectionery sweetener. \n\nI made this with homemade keto brown sugar I made 2/3 cup powdered allulose and added 1/4 teaspoon molasses into the batter to give it more of a traditional pumpkin pie taste. \n\n**Variations**\n\nThis is a very versatile recipe, here's some that I have made: \n\n* Omit the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin and add 1 cup fruit puree for a berry cheesecake add a thickener if the berry puree is too thin, add additional sweetener if your fruit is too tart.\n\n* Omit the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin and add unsweetened cocoa powder. \n\nTake a little bit of your heavy whipping cream, add the cocoa powder and a little thickener and put that in a smoothie blender, blend it until the cocoa powder is no longer grainy. Add any additional sweetener that you might need. (That will be a smaller cheesecake).\n\n* Plain cheesecake, omit pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin puree. Bake the pie crust for 5 or so minutes for a more graham cracker texture. (This will make a smaller cheesecake).\n\nI've made the plain cheesecake recipe into a lemon cheesecake and a key lime cheesecake by adding lemon juice and lemon zest and lime juice and lime zest.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/p7yqb96nt9nd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1725664197.0, "score": 38, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1fassjn/keto_no_bake_pumpkin_cheesecake_including/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Keto Cheesecake ", "selftext": "KETO STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE\n\nPREP: 15 minutes, COOK: 1 hour, CHILLING TIME: 4 hours, TOTAL: 1 hour 15 minutes, SERVINGS: 12\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nCRUST:\n\n2 cups Blanched Almond Flour\n\n1/3 cup unsalted butter (measured solid, then melted)\n\n2 tbsp Monk Fruit Allulose Blend (Granulated)\n\n1 tsp Vanilla extract\n\nCHEESECAKE FILLING:\n\n32 oz Cream cheese (softened)\n\n1 1/4 cup Allulose Sugar Replacement (Powdered)\n\n3 large Eggs\n\n1 tbsp Lemon juice\n\n1 tsp Vanilla extract\n\nSTRAWBERRY TOPPING:\n\n1 1/2 lb Fresh strawberries (divided, 1/2 lb chopped and 1 lb cut into halves)\n\n1/2 cup ChocZero Keto Strawberry Jam\n\n1/2 tbsp Lemon juice\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with parchment paper. (I didn\u2019t do the parchment paper and the crust didn\u2019t stick so I would say this is probably optional)\n\n2. To make the crust, stir the almond flour, melted butter, sugar substitute, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl, until well combined. The dough will be slightly crumbly. Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for about 10 minutes, until barely golden. Let cool for at least 10 minutes.\n\n3. In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to beat the cream cheese and Allulose Powdered at low to medium speed, until fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Finally, beat in the lemon juice and vanilla extract. (Keep the mixer at low to medium the whole time; too high speed will introduce too many air bubbles, which we don't want.)\n\n4. Pour the filling into the pan over the crust. Smooth the top with a spatula (use a pastry spatula for a smoother top if you have one).\n\n5. Bake for about 45-55 minutes, until the center is almost set, but still jiggly. (If you want to be extra careful to avoid cracks, you can wrap the pan in 2 layers of foil, place the pan in a larger baking dish, and fill the dish with warm water going halfway up the sides of the pan. This is called a water bath and helps the temperature change more gradually during baking.)\n\n6. Remove the cheesecake from the oven. If the edges are stuck to the pan, run a knife around the edge (don't remove the springform edge yet). Cool in the pan on the counter to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight), until completely set.\n\n7. Meanwhile, to make the strawberry sauce, combine the chopped strawberries, lemon juice, and jam in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Simmer for about 10 minutes, mashing the sauce as the berries soften, until the strawberries start to break down and a sauce forms.\n\n8. Stir the halved strawberries into the sauce. Heat for 2-3 minutes, until the halves are soft, but not mushy. Remove from heat and let the sauce cool completely to room temperature.\n\n9. Once the cheesecake is set, run a knife along the edges of the springform pan again and remove the sides of the pan. You can carefully transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate, or simply use the bottom of the springform pan for serving.\n\n10. Spoon most of the liquid part of the strawberry sauce over the cheesecake. Arrange the strawberry halves on top. Use any leftover sauce for serving.\n\nNutrition Facts (amount per serving):\n\nServings: 12, Calories: 471, Fat: 41.7g, Protein: 10.6g, Total Carbs: 11g, Net Carbs: 6.8g\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/dfueoe9r84kd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1724289097.0, "score": 66, "author": "GiantChef1", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1ey6lht/keto_cheesecake/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sugar-free Stabilized Whipped Topping AKA Cool Whip", "selftext": "Since I saw that delicious pumpkin cheesecake, thought I would share my recipe that I use for homemade Cool Whip.\n\nThis is made just like making homemade whipped topping AKA Reddi-whip but with a couple of extra ingredients and a little bit more sweetener to make it taste like Cool Whip. \n\nI make mine with unflavored gelatin but it can be made with Xanthan gum. I prefer it with gelatin because it holds up better in the freezer and people have left it sitting on the table for a day at room temperature and it did not melt.\n\nThe amount of vanilla and sweetener are up to individual taste. \n\nCan be made with any sweetener, I prefer allulose.\n\nHere's a tip, never buy confectioner or powdered sweetener. Buy granulated and put it in a coffee grinder or a blender with a grinder blade and you'll save a lot of money. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup heavy whipping cream \n* 1/4 to 1/3 cup powdered sweetener, I use 1/3 cup\n* 1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract, I use 1 tsp \n\n**And one of the following:**\n\n* 1/4 tsp Xanthan gum or other thickener that's 1:1 ratio.\n\n**OR**\n\n* 1 tsp unflavored gelatin + 4 tsp cold water\n\n**How To Bloom The Gelatin:**\n\n1. In a small microwavable bowl, add 4 teaspoons of cold water, slowly sprinkle the gelatin on top. \n\n2. Let it set for for 4 minutes.\n\n3. Place in the microwave, microwave until it's dissolved, that will only be a few seconds! \n\nYou might need to give it a little swirl with a non-stick spatula, you want it dissolved so that it won't be lumpy.\n\n**You do not need to do anything with a gum**\n\n**Preperation:**\n\n1. If possible, freeze a metal mixing bowl for at least 30 minutes (skip if using glass or plastic).\n\n2. Add heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract and whisk until soft peaks form.\n\n3. Sprinkle in the xanthan gum slowly or add the gelatin paste. \n\n4. Continue whisking until it doubles in size. \n\n5. Use immediately or transfer to containers. \n\nCan use a food processor with an S mixing blade.\n\nCan be stored in the refrigerator up to a week. \n\nCan be frozen, If you're going to freeze it it works better with gelatin than xanthan gum, it will harden a bit with xanthan gum. \n\nIf you don't know how to make regular whipped topping: \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 cup heavy whipping cream \n* 1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract \n* 2 to 3 tbsp sweetener (can use erythritol)\n\n**Preparation**\n\n1. If possible freeze a metal bowl for 30 minutes (Skip is using plastic or glass) \n\n2. Add all ingredients to bowl\n\n3. Whisk until stiff peaks form\n\nUse immediately, regular whip topping will liquefy fast in the refrigerator.\n\nDo not freeze, it will turn into a brick and will liquefy when melting.\n\nIf you need a small amount, reduce the recipe by 50%.

{"title": "Keto Dolma", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my copycat keto dolma recipe with you. Dolma (stuffed bell peppers) is a traditional Turkish dish typically made with rice, with or without meat. However, I created a keto version using cauliflower rice.\n\nTraditionally, Turks add ground beef or saut\u00e9ed beef to the filling, or they prepare it without meat, using only olive oil, which elevates the dish to the next level. If you make it without meat, I highly recommend saving some for the next day, as anything with olive oil tastes even better after resting.\n\nSince I\u2019m a bit tired of eating meat, I decided to add olives for a touch of saltiness and feta cheese for richness. I also included tomatoes, which are a traditional ingredient.\n\nI served it with yogurt, which is a must.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can make it: In a pot, partially cook the cauliflower rice and salt it well. In a bowl, chop some tomatoes, olives (a great way to add healthy fats), and feta cheese. Season with your favorite spices\u2014oregano, black pepper, paprika, and Aleppo pepper work great.\n\nCut the tops off the bell peppers, clean out the insides, and stuff them with your mixture. Keep the tops and cover the stuffed peppers with them.\n\nIn a small bowl, mix tomato paste, olive oil, and some water (you can use bone broth instead if you prefer) and drizzle this mixture over the peppers. Cover the pan and cook until the peppers are fork-tender, approximately 40 minutes.\n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/gwpquvaydqid1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1723685500.0, "score": 25, "author": "National_Formal_3867", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1esirya/keto_dolma/", "html_title": ""}

Whisk all ingredients except xanthan gum together in a mixing bowl. Don't use an electric whisk it will splatter everywhere and you'll end up with a mess.\n\nSee notes if using coarse ground horseradish.\n\n2. (Optional) Lightly sprinkle in the xanthan gum, keep whisking as you sprinkle it, that will keep it from clumping. \n\n3. (Optional) Keep whisking until it starts to thicken.\n\nDepending on how thick you want it you might need more than 1/4 teaspoon but I like it at 1/4 teaspoon that gives it the consistency of mustard.\n\n4. Use a funnel and pour into squeeze bottles or pour it into an airtight container.\n\n5. Refrigerate and let set 1+ hour (preferably overnight) before using.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nYou can add more or less horseradish or cayenne pepper or other seasonings to taste depending on how much of a kick or spice you prefer.\n\nThis fit in two 10 oz Dollar Tree aqueeze bottles filled evenly with a little room to spare.\n\nMiracle whip and/or yellow mustard will give it a gross taste, the yellow mustard will overpower it and give it a sour taste. \n\nSome of the avocado oil mayo and organic mayonnaise are a bit on the watery side, if you're going to use those, add extra xanthan gum.\n\nCan substitute 5 tsp white wine vinegar + 1 tsp sweetener (use a little extra sweetener if using erythritol or allulose)\n\nWhite balsamic vinegar gives it a really good kick but it does add a few carbs for the entire batch.\n\nIf using coarse ground prepared horseradish, puree horseradish with apple cider vinegar in a blender before adding to the mixing bowl, I do it in my smoothie blender. I prefer course ground because it gives it more of a kick.\n\nSome people make their own prepared horseradish but that will burn your eyes for a week due to the potency of the horseradish, just take a big bite of fake wasabi....\n\nIf using a fresh lemon to get the most juice out, let lemon get to room temperature and microwave whole unsliced for 10 to 15 seconds before juicing.\n\nYou want the horseradish that is in the produce section or in the fresh pickle section, something like this:\n https://www.target.com/p/silver-spring-fresh-ground-coarse-cut-horseradish-8oz/-/A-51068371. Stores like whole foods market have cleaner versions than this one.\n\n**Storage:**\n\nKeep in a tightly sealed container or tightly sealed squeeze bottle.\n\nWith a thickener, it'll last a couple of weeks or so.\n\nWithout a thickener it will separate and you will get a week out of it. If you're not using a thickener and it starts to separate add a tablespoon of mayo and start whisking it.\n\nYou can freeze it.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1esgfdg/white_bbq_sauce_aka_alabama_white_sauce/", "created_utc": 1723679039.0, "score": 64, "author": "CommercialPound1615", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1esgfdg/white_bbq_sauce_aka_alabama_white_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

If you have enough from thuna or cauliflower pizza dough this could be for you.\n\nYou'll need:\n\nFor the dough\n100 gram powdered almond\n200 gram grated mozzarella \n2 Tbsp cream cheese\n1 egg\n1 tsp garlic granule\n1/4th tsp salt\n\nFor the topping\n2 Tbsp tomato paste\n200 gram grated gouda \n1 garlic clove + 1 Tbsp olive oil\nAdditions such as salami, olives, pepperoni to liking\nOregano \n\nFirst you put the mozzarella and the cream cheese in a microwave safe dish and mix it around. Microwave it for about 90 seconds. If there is no microwave available you can just heat it in a pot until it melted.\n\nNext add the almond powder, the egg, the garlic granule and the salt. Mix thoroughly, first with a fork, then with your hand.\n\nPut 2 sheets of baking paper on top of each other onto the baking sheet. Pour the dough into the center.  Put a large sheet of plastic wrap over it. Next flatten the dough with your hands. You could use a rolling pin afterwards but I didn't need to. The plastic wrap is relevant so nothing sticks to your hands or pin.\n\nHeat your oven to 200 degrees C using circulating air. Bake the dough for at least 5-7 minutes. (I didn't do that. I was dubious about the consistency so I gave it another 5 minutes.)\n\nNext the recipe says to turn the dough around. That's what the 2 layers of baking paper are for. This step is optional and I didn't risk ruining the crust.\n\nMix the tomato paste with water and spread it over the pizza. I needed to use 3 Tbsp paste instead of 2. Probably didn't add enough water.\n\nCut up the garlic clove and mix it with a little olive oil and spread it over the pizza. This step is optional.\n\nAdd remaining toppings to liking and bake the pizza for another 10 minutes.\n\nThe result has potential. I forgot to add part of the almond and it was a little soft because of that probably. Once it cooled down somewhat it had pizza like consistency however.\n\nThis pizza is enough to serve 2 people 2 large, filling pieces each.

It\u2019s crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and a perfect base for your favorite keto-friendly toppings. Made from cauliflower, cheese, and a few simple seasonings, it's a great way to enjoy pizza while staying within your keto lifestyle.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 large cauliflower head (about 1.5 to 2 cups of riced cauliflower)\n* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 large egg\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. **Preheat Oven:**\n   * Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.\n2. **Prepare Cauliflower:**\n   * Remove the stems and leaves from the cauliflower. Cut it into florets. Use a food processor to pulse the cauliflower into a rice-like texture. You should have about 2-3 cups of riced cauliflower.\n   * Steam the riced cauliflower in a pot for about 5 minutes until tender, or microwave it in a covered bowl for about 4-5 minutes.\n3. **Remove Moisture:**\n   * Place the steamed cauliflower in a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for getting a crispy crust.\n4. **Mix Ingredients:**\n   * In a large bowl, combine the drained cauliflower, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but manageable.\n5. **Form the Crust:**\n   * Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet. Press and spread it out into a circular shape, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Use the back of a spoon or your hands to shape it evenly.\n6. **Bake the Crust:**\n   * Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and crispy around the edges.\n7. **Add Toppings (Optional):**\n   * If you want to add toppings, remove the crust from the oven, add your favorite keto-friendly toppings (e.g., tomato sauce, cheese, meats, and vegetables), and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes, or until the toppings are cooked and cheese is melted.\n8. **Serve:**\n   * Allow the pizza to cool slightly before slicing.

{"title": "Pressure cooker carnitas, cooks in just 30 minutes", "selftext": "[The recipe is taken from here](https://villacocina.com/carnitas-recipes/), with a few adjustments, and some edits made for clearer instructions. First of all, the full eight pounds that the recipe calls for does not fit in the standard 6-quart Instant Pot. So all measurements have been cut in half, and the cook time has been reduced from 40 minutes to 30. The natural release time of 10 minutes remains unchanged.\n\nSecond, the recipe calls for pork belly with the skin, and I chose skinless. And it calls for bone-in pork shoulder, while mine was boneless. [Everything still came out fine.](https://imgur.com/a/Zojje4v)\n\nThe recipe may look long and complicated, but it really just comes down to: Throw together some seasoning liquid, chop up some pork, brown the pork, throw the liquid and pork into the pot, cook it, let the steam release, then finish the carnitas in the broiler.\n\nThe pork itself:\n\n* 1.5 pounds pork belly\n* 2.5 pounds pork shoulder (aka Boston butt)\n* 1 tbsp avocado oil (olive oil or coconut oil are probably fine too)\n\nBut first, we create the seasoning liquid.\n\n* 1/4 medium white onion, roughly diced \n* 3/4 tsp Mexican oregano, dry (I used regular oregano)\n* 1/4 tsp black pepper, whole\n* 2 cloves, whole \n* 1/4 tsp dry thyme\n* 1/4 cup orange juice (2 ounces, or about half an orange; Google estimates just 6g of carbs there)\n* 1/4 cup water (with another 1/4 cup added later)\n* 1 tbsp kosher salt (but it can be any salt, really)\n\nPlace these ingredients in a blender and blend until everything is well-mixed. Set the liquid aside while you prep the pork.\n\nAlso set aside: \n\n* The rind from the half of an orange that you just squeezed\n\n* 1 head of garlic (That is, an entire bulb, not just a single clove; one clove contains about 1g of net carbs, but we won't be eating it -- it's just there to add flavor during the cooking process.)\n\n* 2 bay leaves\n\n\n1. The Pork: Start with the pork shoulder, cutting it into large pieces. You will need to cut around the bone, but don\u2019t throw it away -- we are using it. Now, with the knife, remove the skin from the pork belly and cut into large squares. Don\u2019t cut them too small. Cut the remainder of the belly into the same size and shape as the skin. Set aside momentarily. \n\n2. Instant pot, 6 qt : First step is to brown the meat. Set your instant pot on HIGH SAUTE mode. Set it to 30 MINUTES. You can add more time later, if needed. Go ahead and START it. Once done preheating, pour in the avocado oil and brown each side of the meat, starting with the pork shoulder. *[Note from me: I did it for about 2 minutes on a side. Took about half an hour for the whole thing.]* Don\u2019t over-crowd the pot. Be patient and do it in batches. Transfer the pork pieces into a large dish as they become ready. Brown the bone as well. Up next, our final batch, the pork belly.\n\n3. When all the pork is done browning, press CANCEL. Place all the pork back into the pot, and pour in the seasoned blended mix. Pour the other 1/4 cup of water into the blender cup, swirl and pour into the pot. Slice the top of the garlic bulb off to expose the cloves, then add the bulb, bay leaves and the half of an orange rind that we set aside earlier.\n\n4. COVER, secure the lid and cook on HIGH PRESSURE for 30 MINUTES, with a 10 MINUTE  NATURAL PRESSURE RELEASE. *[Note from me: Begin heating your broiler when there is about 10 minutes left on the cook time.]* After the natural pressure release is done, QUICK RELEASE the remaining pressure. Finally, press CANCEL and remove the lid. The carnitas should be super tender. \n\n5. Transfer all the carnitas on to a sheet pan and evenly spread them. Don\u2019t shred them at this point, to prevent them from drying out. Place the sheet pan in the broiler -- use oven mitts, because the sheet pan can get really hot. Allow the carnitas to brown and crisp up a bit -- about 5-10 minutes. Be careful if you hear the occasional grease popping, it may happen. TURN OFF the broiler as soon as the carnitas look ready. Remove the sheet pan from the oven, shred the carnitas apart and ENJOY in TACOS or as you desire.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1edu0g6/pressure_cooker_carnitas_cooks_in_just_30_minutes/", "created_utc": 1722123786.0, "score": 27, "author": "Captain_Midnight", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1edu0g6/pressure_cooker_carnitas_cooks_in_just_30_minutes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Chicken Tarragon", "selftext": "Ingredients:\nChicken (breasts or tenderloins)\nAlmond flour\nPork rinds\nParmesan cheese\nButter\nMore butter\nTarragon\nEggs\n\n1) crush or lightly blend pork rinds until broken up into small pieces. Then mix in parmesan cheese to make a 50/50 mix of the two. Optional: you can mix tarragon in at this point if desired.\n\n2) blend whole raw eggs (white and yolk) in a medium or large bowl. Setup additional plates/bowls with almond flour and another withthe breading mix.\n\n3) dip chicken in egg and allow excess to run off back into dish. Coat generously with almond flour, making sure there are no bare spots, and allow the excess to shake off back onto the dish. Now redip the chicken in the egg, allow excess to run off. Then coat in breading mix, making sure there are no bare spots.\n\n4) pan fry chicken pieces in butter on medium-high heat until breading begins to brown. Flip, repeat and then place fried pieces in a greased baking dish (I use large glass dishes).\n\n5) melt butter in the microwave and mix in a generous helping of tarragon. Pour over fried pieces of chicken to ensure that the breading is saturated and not dry. Dry breading will end up tasting like burnt pork rinds!!!\n\nNote: if you are making a large batch, make sure to pour butter on the bottom layer first, then stack another layer of chicken on top (i try to stagger the pieces a bit) and add butter over the second layer. Once there is a generous amount of butter in the dish, you can use a spoon or ladle to collect some from the bottom to pour over pieces that are dry.\n\n6) bake at 350\u00b0F for 30-45 minutes until chicken is done internally. I like to remove it from the oven every 15 minutes to reapply butter to the breading to ensure it doesnt dry out. I just cut a few of the larger pieces from different spots to check the doneness of the chicken.\n\n7) while chicken is cooking, I like to make a side of butter with more tarragon to pour over the chicken and sides. Just melt more butter and mix tarragon to taste.\n\nThats it. Its a bit of a process, but its delicious if you do it right. This was my favorite recipe before keto and it took a few attempts to make it keto. Goes great with cauliflour rice and broccoli which also taste great with the tarragon butter drizzled over them ;). It also reheats well in the microwave, but make sure to apply butter over the pieces prior to reheating to prevent drying out the breading.\n\nWhen it comes to ingredient amounts, it will all depends on the size and quantity of the chicken pieces. The tarragon goes a long way and it doesnt take a lot. I use maybe a table spoon or two per 8oz of butter. Its better to have more ready than less when you get started so you dont run out of ingredients while you are in the breading and frying stage of the process.\n\nLastly, I like to make kind of an assembly line on the counter. A bowl with eggs, then a plate or bowl with almond flour, then another dish with the breading mix and then a baking dish for the oven on the other side of the stove so each piece of chicken can go from one thing to the next easily. I use the same egg dish for the pre and post flour egg application.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. Hopefully the recipe isnt too hard to follow and you enjoy it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1du4d47", "created_utc": 1719976434.0, "score": 26, "author": "dctravis", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/ketorecipes/comments/1du4d47/chicken_tarragon/", "html_title": ""}

Once smooth, add the egg and vanilla. Once blended add the sweetener. Poor mixture over crust. For my crust I used about two servings of the snickerdoodle cookies. But a dish of hot water on the lower baking rack in the oven under where the cheese cake will go. And bake for 50 minutes. Now my dish I used for the cheese cake was glass roughly 4-5 inches wide and 4 inches deep. It was just what I had that I thought would fit the ingredients and it worked lovely.

I made a few minor modifications, cooked it on the smoker, and was very happy with how it came out.\n\nSmoked Jalapeno Popper Chicken Casserole\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 1 rotisserie chicken (meat removed & shredded)\n- 6 slices of bacon (cut into 1/2\" pieces)\n- 1 small onion (diced)\n- 4 jalapenos\n- 3 cloves garlic (minced)\n- 8oz cream cheese\n- 1/2 cup half & half (or heavy cream)\n- 2tsp BBQ rub\n- 6oz shredded cheddar\n\n1. Set the cream cheese out on the counter at least an hour before you begin so that it can soften.\n\n2. Preheat the smoker to around 225 degrees.\n\n3. Cut 1 of the jalapenos into thin rings and reserve for later. Cut the remaining 3 jalapenos in half, remove the ribs and seeds, and then dice.\n\n4. In a medium sized (I used 10\") cast iron (or other oven safe pan) cook the bacon pieces on medium low heat until browned and crispy. \n\n5. Remove the bacon and reserve for later. Also reserve the bacon fat.\n\n6. In the same pan, return 1 tbsp of reserved bacon fat, add the onions and a small pinch of salt. Then cook the onions on medium heat until translucent, about 5-7 minutes. If needed you can add a couple tbsp of water to help the onions soften and to pull up some of the browned bits of fond from the bottom of the pan.\n\n7. Add the diced jalapenos and cook for another 2-3 minutes until softened.\n\n8. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Remove from heat.\n\n9. Add the cream cheese and half & half to the pan and mix until smooth (or you can mix together in a bowl and add to the pan if easier).\n\n10. Add 1/2 of the reserved bacon to the pan along with most of the shredded chicken (use your best judgement. I ended up using about 75% of a whole chicken).\n\n11. Stir in 1-2 tsp of your favorite all purpose BBQ rub. (If using a saltier rub like Lawry's or Tony Chachere's start with 1 tsp, give it a minute to dissolve. Then taste for seasoning and adjust, remembering that it will reduce some and become saltier as it cooks.)\n\n12. Put the pan in the smoker and cook at 225 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\n13. Remove the pan, add shredded cheddar, reserved jalapeno rings, and reserved bacon to the top and then return pan to the smoker. Increase temperature to 400 (or put it in the oven set at 450) and cook until the top is nicely browned, about 20 more minutes on the smoker (or 10 minutes in the oven).\n\n\n\nServed with a nice side salad to add some freshness and crunch to the plate, this turned out to be a very tasty meal. \n\nThis recipe is easy to customize and make your own by mixing up the veggies. Some rough chopped broccoli or cauliflower could be nice, or you could swap out the protein for about 1 1/2lbs of other ground/shredded meat.
