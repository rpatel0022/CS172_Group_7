Add onion and 1/2 tsp of salt. Cook 5-7 then add your garlic and cook until fragrant. \n- add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly until it begins to brown.\n- add brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, allspice, peppercorns and cloves.\n- add wine and bring to a simmer; cooking until thick and syrupy. (3-5mins) stir in your prunes and Worcestershire.\n- place your roast in the pot and coat it with the liquid, putting some on top as well. \n- place into the oven and cook until a knife meets no resistance (I did 4 hours) then remove the roast and rest it in foil for 30mins.\n- pour contents of the pot through a mesh strainer to a medium size bowl (you\u2019re going to have to press to get all the liquid and fruit pulp through) discard all the extra solids and let that mixture sit for a few minutes then skim the fat off. Roughly 1 to 1 1/2 cups of liquid+pulp should remain.\n- return that mixture to the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat.\n- Make a slurry (3 tbsp water + your cornstarch) and pour that into the simmering liquid, stir it constantly and cook until lightly thickened (about 2mins)\n- Mix in your vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepp!\n- Transfer your rested meat onto the cutting board, cut your slices and top it off with the sauce! \nI hope you all enjoy and I am so sorry to have left you all hanging for the day \ud83e\udd72", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ei8a3snvtnde1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1737165822.0, "score": 219, "author": "StankyLeg666", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/1i3x1mf/colombian_braised_beef_w_stewed_black_eyed_peas/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Fall is coming soon, so I thought I'd post some guidelines on Gumbo for any newbies. [Not A Recipe]", "selftext": "Hi, all. I'm looking forward to making my first pot this year sometime soon. I recently returned from a trip to Florida, and they had 'authentic' Gumbo on the menus there, so I figured I'd write a post about the subject. I don't claim to know everything, but I think people could use some pointers. This is not meant as a historical origins or anything, just what it is like in Louisiana in modern times.\n\n****************************************************************************\n**What is in Gumbo?** - *Anything that walks, swims, crawls or flies*\n\nThis one may be sort of obvious, but I'd like to clarify. Gumbos can have a lot of things in them, but there are some things a Gumbo *has* to have.\n\n* *[Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_(cuisine)* - Trinity is Celery, Bell Pepper and Onions. I usually use approximately equal parts but you can kinda do whatever you like. Don't write the celery off, though, without it it really loses a component. \n\n\n\n* *[Roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux)* - Flour and Oil/Fat, equal in weight, cooked. Could be blonde, could be brick, but your Gumbo has to have a roux. A note on roux:I have found that if you are making a seafood gumbo, you want a lighter roux, with less deep flavor, because it can overpower the seafood such as crab, fish or oysters. Lighter rouxs tend to thicken more, so you need less of them. Chicken and Sausage, or other meat-based gumbos, would generally use a darker roux for more flavor.\n\n\n* *[Stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_(food)* - You could probably use water and still call it a gumbo, but that would be a shame. Your taste buds would be as sad as the color of the thing that you made.\n\nThere are a lot of other things that are pretty traditional, and some people would probably argue that Bay Leaves have to be included, but honestly if you have those three central ingredients I think it all counts. What's next is two different combinations that results in the various ones you see out there, what I'd call the Style and Variety. These are terms I've just come up with, don't take it as cannon.\n\n****************************************************************************\n\n\n**Styles of Gumbo**\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nBroadly speaking I believe there are two distinct styles of gumbo: Cajun and Creole. When debate rages about what a gumbo is, I believe most of the time the main problem is that people fail to distinguish between the two styles.\n\n* **Cajun** - These *have a tendency* to have darker rouxs. Honestly I think of Cajun as the default, it has the three ingredients listed above and can be a number of varieties and that I'll list below.\n\n* **Creole** - Creole gumbos frequently, and I would say possibly have to have the three above, with the addition of Okra and Tomatoes. If you see 'red' gumbos in pictures, this is why. Creole gumbos are more likely to be seafood gumbos.\n\n****************************************************************************\n\n**Varieties**\n\n****************************************************************************\n\n* *Gumbo z'Herbes* - This is a gumbo, made in either of the two styles above, with no meat. Greens are usually (99%) involved, and a lot of them because they cook down. I have seen people throw in a ham bone like any other time when you'd cook greens. \n\n* *Seafood* - There's no set ingredients for any gumbo, muchless Seafood, but seafood usually includes shrimp and crabs, specifically gumbo crabs. Everything else is just up to the cook. Oysters are not uncommon. Fish fillets sometimes, they usually break up though and I honestly haven't seen many seafood gumbos using fish. Theoretically you could use any sort of seafood. One thing I have seen a lot of that confuses me is Shrimp and Sausage. I really didn't see this growing up, and it really kinda flies in the face of what you are attempting to accomplish. Sausage will overpower the shrimp which is a real shame, I'd advise against using it in a seafood gumbo, really. \n\n* *Chicken and Sausage* **or** *Meat* - Chicken and Sausage is by far and away the most common gumbo I really see in Louisiana. Of course, you can use whatever you want. Other common ones are: Turkey and Sausage (Especially after Thanksgiving), Duck (Sometimes with Sausage), Turtle, Alligator, or combinations. I've never seen a beef Gumbo but I'm sure someone out there has made one. Never seen Deer, but Deer Sausage I have. \n\n****************************************************************************\n\n**Other ingredients**\n\n* *Fil\u00e9* - Usually served with the gumbo, next to the salt and pepper. Some people like more, some people don't like it at all. \n\n* *Other Seasonings* - Bay Leaves are almost always involved, but any other spices or herbs are pretty wide open. Not everything will fit the flavor profile. Usually people will say 'Cajun Spices' but there's no agreement on what 'Cajun Spices' are, really. Best bet is a can of Slap Ya Mama's or Tony Chacheres.\n\n* *Corn* - This harkens back to when I went to Florida. On the picture with the word 'Authentic' splashed a half dozen times over it was a bowl of soup with corn in it. I've been making Gumbo for 25 years now and I have never once even heard of putting corn in it. You can do what you want, but that's like throwing corn on pizza (Which I think Switzerland or somewhere does). You can do it if you want but that's not how anyone in Louisiana I know of does it. \n\nAnyway, those are just my thoughts. I'm sure I'll be flamed to hell and back, but lets hear it.

{"title": "Now that it\u2019s fall I\u2019m excited forward to one of my favorite childhood dishes (although I\u2019ve never perfectly recreated it)", "selftext": "Growing up near Athens, GA we had a local dish called Chicken Mull. In the late fall/winter it was common at almost every local BBQ restaurant (as a side but it was also commonly sold by the quart so people could take it home). It showed up at church potlucks, fundraisers, and every grandmother\u2019s kitchen. I\u2019ve only seen it in Athens and the surrounding areas and once in western North Carolina. \n\n Chicken Mull is a very simple type of chicken stew that is made from chicken, chicken broth, saltine crackers and a lot of milk, seasoning varied some. It\u2019s white from all the milk. It\u2019s almost always from chicken today but historically it was made from any meat you had available, rabbit was very popular. \n\nWhen served it was customary to put out salt/pepper, shredded cheddar cheese, saltine crackers and hot sauce. Most people used some combination of those with the hot sauce as a an option for those that wanted it. My preference is enough saltiness to make it VERY thick, a bunch of cheese and pepper, a dash of salt and a dash of hot sauce. \n\nIt\u2019s a lovely comfort food from my childhood that isn\u2019t made or sold in the area of upstate South Carolina where I now live so I make it a few times every fall/winter. Although it\u2019s simple and I\u2019ve made some decent copies I\u2019ve never been able to really nail the exact taste. \n\nHas anyone else had Chicken Mull, is something similar made in your area, or what cold weather comfort food do you always look forward to?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/xpgta8/now_that_its_fall_im_excited_forward_to_one_of_my/", "created_utc": 1664285311.0, "score": 56, "author": "Icy_Plenty_7117", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/xpgta8/now_that_its_fall_im_excited_forward_to_one_of_my/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

But my American friends have strongly recommended B&G as a quintessential Southern breakfast. So I've decided to cook it myself.\n\nHowever I wanted some advice what to avoid, what to do etc. And have multiple questions:\n\n1. I will be making breakfast sausage myself, as it is also not available here. I plan to use this recipe: [https://laurenslatest.com/easy-homemade-breakfast-sausage/](https://laurenslatest.com/easy-homemade-breakfast-sausage/) is it any good? I want to get something close to \"real deal\".\n2. I have not chosen biscuits recipe yet. Can I make dough day before? Or do I have to make it fresh?\n3. Also I have doubts about making gravy. Should I remove meat after frying it and just use fat for making white sauce, or should I add flour to the meat and then add milk? Also can I make gravy the day before?\n4. Should I serve it with eggs, and if so sunny side up or flipped? I assume runny yolk.\n\nI'd be grateful for any help in the matter. My plan is Sunday breakfast, so I don't have much time to make additional purchases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd I\u2019ve succeed:) Thanks everyone for advice.

{"title": "We're fallin' for fall tonight, Southern style. Making shredded chicken with smoky BBQ sauce over brown butter pumpkin-cheddar grits!", "selftext": "Hi, all! SignKitchen here--my fiance and I are making a meal tonight in celebration of my Southern food roots on our stream, and I wanted to share the recipe here and drop the link for [SignKitchen](https://twitch.tv/SignKitchen) for anyone interested. (We use both ASL and English, so it's definitely unique!)\n\nAnyway, recipe is as follows!\n\nIngredients:\n\nBBQ Sauce:\n\n* 3 tbsp olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 c ketchup\n* 1/4 c water\n* 1/4 c apple cider vinegar\n* 1/4 c brown sugar\n* 2 tsp paprika\n* 1 tsp smoked paprika\n* 1 tsp chili powder\n* 1 tsp cayenne\n\nShredded BBQ Chicken:\n\n* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast\n* pepper\n* 1 cup chicken broth\n* 1 cup BBQ sauce\n* 1/4 cup molasses\n* 1 tbsp ground ancho chili pepper\n* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon\n\nBrown Butter Pumpkin-Cheddar Grits:\n\n* 2 c chicken broth\n* 1 c old fashioned grits\n* salt to taste\n* 4 tbsp unsalted butter\n* 1 c whole milk\n* 3/4 c pumpkin puree\n* 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg\n* salt and pepper to taste\n* 4-5 oz freshly grated sharp cheddar\n\nDirections:\n\n* To make the BBQ sauce, heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add minced garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and let cook for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer 15 minutes until thickened.\nThis will keep in the fridge for up to a month.\n\n* Sprinkle the chicken breast with pepper and place in large nonstick skillet.\n* In a large bowl, combine broth, BBQ sauce, molasses, ancho, and cinnamon; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or so until thermometer reads 165 degrees. Shred meat and return to skillet.\n\n* Meanwhile, bring 2 cups of broth to a rolling boil and add 1 cup old fashioned grits. Stir vigorously then reduce heat to low and cover. Allow grits to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n* While grits cook, brown butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Let butter melt untouched, then once it starts to simmer and brown, whisk constantly until butter is golden and fragrant. Remove from heat.\n* Once grits absorb broth, add milk and pumpkin puree. Season to taste with salt and grated nutmeg and continue to cook on lowest setting for 5-10 minutes. \n* Stir in 4-5 oz freshly grated cheddar cheese, along with brown butter and adjust salt and pepper to taste.\n* Put grits in a bowl and chicken on top. Enjoy and serve warm!\n\nHope y'all enjoy this recipe as much as we do!

Here\u2019s the recipe from the 2021 milk street cookbook! \n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n- 5lb boneless beef chuck roast (trim fat, pat down)\n- 1 large yellow onion \n- 10 garlic cloves \n- 2 tbsp tomato paste\n- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar\n- 2 cinnamon sticks\n- 1 tbsp whole allspice\n- 2 tsp whole black peppercorns\n- 1 tsp whole cloves\n- 1 cup dry red wine \n- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce\n- 1 cup pitted prunes (roughly chopped)\n- 1 tbsp corn starch \n- 3 tbsp red wine vinegar \n- \nSTEPS:\n\n- Preheat oven to 300, rack in middle position. \n(The recipe I used calls for you to twine the chuck roast; I did not)\n- in a large dutch oven heat oil over medium high heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/2 tsp of salt. Cook 5-7 then add your garlic and cook until fragrant. \n- add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly until it begins to brown.\n- add brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, allspice, peppercorns and cloves.\n- add wine and bring to a simmer; cooking until thick and syrupy. (3-5mins) stir in your prunes and Worcestershire.\n- place your roast in the pot and coat it with the liquid, putting some on top as well. \n- place into the oven and cook until a knife meets no resistance (I did 4 hours) then remove the roast and rest it in foil for 30mins.\n- pour contents of the pot through a mesh strainer to a medium size bowl (you\u2019re going to have to press to get all the liquid and fruit pulp through) discard all the extra solids and let that mixture sit for a few minutes then skim the fat off. Roughly 1 to 1 1/2 cups of liquid+pulp should remain.\n- return that mixture to the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat.\n- Make a slurry (3 tbsp water + your cornstarch) and pour that into the simmering liquid, stir it constantly and cook until lightly thickened (about 2mins)\n- Mix in your vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepp!\n- Transfer your rested meat onto the cutting board, cut your slices and top it off with the sauce! \nI hope you all enjoy and I am so sorry to have left you all hanging for the day \ud83e\udd72", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ei8a3snvtnde1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1737165822.0, "score": 223, "author": "StankyLeg666", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/1i3x1mf/colombian_braised_beef_w_stewed_black_eyed_peas/", "html_title": ""}

The part I can\u2019t figure out is how she got the sides to rise so much and create almost a shoulder for lack of better words, on the sides. \n\nWhen I make mine, I preheat my skillet with oil, mix it, pull it out, add my batter and go. It always turns out great but I can\u2019t figure out that high sided crust part. \n\nIf I put too much batter in, it just balloons in the center, to little, it\u2019s crispy all the way around but still good. \n\nIs it possible that she just used straight cornmeal and no self-rising? Maybe that\u2019s the trick. I\u2019ve always used white lily self-rising. Maybe that\u2019s the ticket? \n\nIf you have suggestions, please let me know.

{"title": "Now that it\u2019s fall I\u2019m excited forward to one of my favorite childhood dishes (although I\u2019ve never perfectly recreated it)", "selftext": "Growing up near Athens, GA we had a local dish called Chicken Mull. In the late fall/winter it was common at almost every local BBQ restaurant (as a side but it was also commonly sold by the quart so people could take it home). It showed up at church potlucks, fundraisers, and every grandmother\u2019s kitchen. I\u2019ve only seen it in Athens and the surrounding areas and once in western North Carolina. \n\n Chicken Mull is a very simple type of chicken stew that is made from chicken, chicken broth, saltine crackers and a lot of milk, seasoning varied some. It\u2019s white from all the milk. It\u2019s almost always from chicken today but historically it was made from any meat you had available, rabbit was very popular. \n\nWhen served it was customary to put out salt/pepper, shredded cheddar cheese, saltine crackers and hot sauce. Most people used some combination of those with the hot sauce as a an option for those that wanted it. My preference is enough saltiness to make it VERY thick, a bunch of cheese and pepper, a dash of salt and a dash of hot sauce. \n\nIt\u2019s a lovely comfort food from my childhood that isn\u2019t made or sold in the area of upstate South Carolina where I now live so I make it a few times every fall/winter. Although it\u2019s simple and I\u2019ve made some decent copies I\u2019ve never been able to really nail the exact taste. \n\nHas anyone else had Chicken Mull, is something similar made in your area, or what cold weather comfort food do you always look forward to?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/xpgta8/now_that_its_fall_im_excited_forward_to_one_of_my/", "created_utc": 1664285311.0, "score": 55, "author": "Icy_Plenty_7117", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/xpgta8/now_that_its_fall_im_excited_forward_to_one_of_my/", "html_title": ""}

My biggest fear is messing it up in front of a bunch of people!\n\nThank you in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/uxhhnd/request_lowcountry_boil_frogmore_stew_recipe/", "created_utc": 1653485589.0, "score": 26, "author": "Beefcakesupernova", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/uxhhnd/request_lowcountry_boil_frogmore_stew_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How long do uncooked green peanuts stay good?", "selftext": "I live up north (Michigan), where green peanuts are nearly non-existent.

I'd read on this sub that green peanuts will keep for 3-4 months if refrigerated in a sealed plastic bag.\n\nHowever, that doesn't appear to be the case. Now that my busy period is finally over in early November, I pulled them out of the fridge to finally boil them, and they appear to have gone bad. One bag is a little more obvious than the other, but they both show quite a few signs of molding and/or rotting. Some of the peanuts *appear* okay on a quick glance, but I'm assuming that's probably incorrect.\n\nI'm really, really bummed about this. There's no way for me to get more green peanuts without waiting a year-- and I'll be right back in the same situation next September/October.

{"title": "I want to cook Biscuits & Gravy, but...", "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm from Poland and I'm in Poland. I never had Biscuits & Gravy and there is no option to buy it here. But my American friends have strongly recommended B&G as a quintessential Southern breakfast. So I've decided to cook it myself.\n\nHowever I wanted some advice what to avoid, what to do etc. And have multiple questions:\n\n1. I will be making breakfast sausage myself, as it is also not available here. I plan to use this recipe: [https://laurenslatest.com/easy-homemade-breakfast-sausage/](https://laurenslatest.com/easy-homemade-breakfast-sausage/) is it any good? I want to get something close to \"real deal\".\n2. I have not chosen biscuits recipe yet. Can I make dough day before? Or do I have to make it fresh?\n3. Also I have doubts about making gravy. Should I remove meat after frying it and just use fat for making white sauce, or should I add flour to the meat and then add milk? Also can I make gravy the day before?\n4. Should I serve it with eggs, and if so sunny side up or flipped? I assume runny yolk.\n\nI'd be grateful for any help in the matter. My plan is Sunday breakfast, so I don't have much time to make additional purchases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd I\u2019ve succeed:) Thanks everyone for advice.

However, I made the mistake of starting it right before one of the busiest times in my entire career. That pork was supposed to pickle for \"3 to 7 days\", but it has now been 14 days. I've been turning it daily, and kept the one little air bubble away from the meat so spoilage shouldn't be an issue. \n\nDoes being in the pickling liquid for that long create any problems/concerns, or can I go ahead and use it? This is partly a food-safety question (which is why I'm not asking another sub) and partly a culinary question (which is why I'm asking this sub). I'm hoping this is just going to make my red beans extra tasty.\n\nEDIT, two months later: The pork was completely fine. I drained it and froze it like normal, then used half of it a few weeks later to make red beans, which were still delicious. (I've added my recipe in a comment below, per a request.) I ate the entire pot myself over the course of about 10 days, and had zero ill effects.\n\nThe only difference from the extra time in the pickling liquid was a noticeably stronger 'pickled' flavor in my finished batch of red beans. I used 1.4 lbs of the meat instead of the 1 lb my recipe calls for, so between the extra meat and the longer pickling time, it imparted a stronger 'pickled' flavor than I wanted, but it was still good. Next time I cook this, I'll stick to the 1 lb of meat; next time I make pickled pork, I'll pickle it for 6 to 8 days.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/j1bmpp/how_long_is_too_long_for_pickling_pork/", "created_utc": 1601298399.0, "score": 15, "author": "ornryactor", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/j1bmpp/how_long_is_too_long_for_pickling_pork/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "We're fallin' for fall tonight, Southern style. Making shredded chicken with smoky BBQ sauce over brown butter pumpkin-cheddar grits!", "selftext": "Hi, all! SignKitchen here--my fiance and I are making a meal tonight in celebration of my Southern food roots on our stream, and I wanted to share the recipe here and drop the link for [SignKitchen](https://twitch.tv/SignKitchen) for anyone interested. (We use both ASL and English, so it's definitely unique!)\n\nAnyway, recipe is as follows!\n\nIngredients:\n\nBBQ Sauce:\n\n* 3 tbsp olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 c ketchup\n* 1/4 c water\n* 1/4 c apple cider vinegar\n* 1/4 c brown sugar\n* 2 tsp paprika\n* 1 tsp smoked paprika\n* 1 tsp chili powder\n* 1 tsp cayenne\n\nShredded BBQ Chicken:\n\n* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast\n* pepper\n* 1 cup chicken broth\n* 1 cup BBQ sauce\n* 1/4 cup molasses\n* 1 tbsp ground ancho chili pepper\n* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon\n\nBrown Butter Pumpkin-Cheddar Grits:\n\n* 2 c chicken broth\n* 1 c old fashioned grits\n* salt to taste\n* 4 tbsp unsalted butter\n* 1 c whole milk\n* 3/4 c pumpkin puree\n* 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg\n* salt and pepper to taste\n* 4-5 oz freshly grated sharp cheddar\n\nDirections:\n\n* To make the BBQ sauce, heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add minced garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and let cook for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer 15 minutes until thickened.\nThis will keep in the fridge for up to a month.\n\n* Sprinkle the chicken breast with pepper and place in large nonstick skillet.\n* In a large bowl, combine broth, BBQ sauce, molasses, ancho, and cinnamon; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or so until thermometer reads 165 degrees. Shred meat and return to skillet.\n\n* Meanwhile, bring 2 cups of broth to a rolling boil and add 1 cup old fashioned grits. Stir vigorously then reduce heat to low and cover. Allow grits to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n* While grits cook, brown butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Let butter melt untouched, then once it starts to simmer and brown, whisk constantly until butter is golden and fragrant. Remove from heat.\n* Once grits absorb broth, add milk and pumpkin puree. Season to taste with salt and grated nutmeg and continue to cook on lowest setting for 5-10 minutes. \n* Stir in 4-5 oz freshly grated cheddar cheese, along with brown butter and adjust salt and pepper to taste.\n* Put grits in a bowl and chicken on top. Enjoy and serve warm!\n\nHope y'all enjoy this recipe as much as we do!

Add 2-3 ears of grilled corn to the Pico. \n\n[Grilled Chicken with Quick-Pickled Squash Salad](https://www.southernliving.com/recipes/grilled-chicken-pickled-squash-salad) As always with SL recipes, add at least double spices and aromatics, double the red wine vinegar, use an entire shallot, 3-5 garlic cloves, and way more than 1 tbsp of pepper. I marinated the chicken overnight with a simple soy and red wine vinegar recipe.

Add onion and 1/2 tsp of salt. Cook 5-7 then add your garlic and cook until fragrant. \n- add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly until it begins to brown.\n- add brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, allspice, peppercorns and cloves.\n- add wine and bring to a simmer; cooking until thick and syrupy. (3-5mins) stir in your prunes and Worcestershire.\n- place your roast in the pot and coat it with the liquid, putting some on top as well. \n- place into the oven and cook until a knife meets no resistance (I did 4 hours) then remove the roast and rest it in foil for 30mins.\n- pour contents of the pot through a mesh strainer to a medium size bowl (you\u2019re going to have to press to get all the liquid and fruit pulp through) discard all the extra solids and let that mixture sit for a few minutes then skim the fat off. Roughly 1 to 1 1/2 cups of liquid+pulp should remain.\n- return that mixture to the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat.\n- Make a slurry (3 tbsp water + your cornstarch) and pour that into the simmering liquid, stir it constantly and cook until lightly thickened (about 2mins)\n- Mix in your vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepp!\n- Transfer your rested meat onto the cutting board, cut your slices and top it off with the sauce! \nI hope you all enjoy and I am so sorry to have left you all hanging for the day \ud83e\udd72", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ei8a3snvtnde1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1737165822.0, "score": 217, "author": "StankyLeg666", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/1i3x1mf/colombian_braised_beef_w_stewed_black_eyed_peas/", "html_title": ""}

The part I can\u2019t figure out is how she got the sides to rise so much and create almost a shoulder for lack of better words, on the sides. \n\nWhen I make mine, I preheat my skillet with oil, mix it, pull it out, add my batter and go.

{"title": "Now that it\u2019s fall I\u2019m excited forward to one of my favorite childhood dishes (although I\u2019ve never perfectly recreated it)", "selftext": "Growing up near Athens, GA we had a local dish called Chicken Mull. In the late fall/winter it was common at almost every local BBQ restaurant (as a side but it was also commonly sold by the quart so people could take it home). It showed up at church potlucks, fundraisers, and every grandmother\u2019s kitchen. I\u2019ve only seen it in Athens and the surrounding areas and once in western North Carolina. \n\n Chicken Mull is a very simple type of chicken stew that is made from chicken, chicken broth, saltine crackers and a lot of milk, seasoning varied some. It\u2019s white from all the milk. It\u2019s almost always from chicken today but historically it was made from any meat you had available, rabbit was very popular. \n\nWhen served it was customary to put out salt/pepper, shredded cheddar cheese, saltine crackers and hot sauce. Most people used some combination of those with the hot sauce as a an option for those that wanted it. My preference is enough saltiness to make it VERY thick, a bunch of cheese and pepper, a dash of salt and a dash of hot sauce. \n\nIt\u2019s a lovely comfort food from my childhood that isn\u2019t made or sold in the area of upstate South Carolina where I now live so I make it a few times every fall/winter. Although it\u2019s simple and I\u2019ve made some decent copies I\u2019ve never been able to really nail the exact taste. \n\nHas anyone else had Chicken Mull, is something similar made in your area, or what cold weather comfort food do you always look forward to?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/xpgta8/now_that_its_fall_im_excited_forward_to_one_of_my/", "created_utc": 1664285311.0, "score": 55, "author": "Icy_Plenty_7117", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/xpgta8/now_that_its_fall_im_excited_forward_to_one_of_my/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How long do uncooked green peanuts stay good?", "selftext": "I live up north (Michigan), where green peanuts are nearly non-existent. I discovered a market that had them and went and bought 10 pounds on October 3.

I'd read on this sub that green peanuts will keep for 3-4 months if refrigerated in a sealed plastic bag.\n\nHowever, that doesn't appear to be the case. Now that my busy period is finally over in early November, I pulled them out of the fridge to finally boil them, and they appear to have gone bad. One bag is a little more obvious than the other, but they both show quite a few signs of molding and/or rotting. Some of the peanuts *appear* okay on a quick glance, but I'm assuming that's probably incorrect.\n\nI'm really, really bummed about this. There's no way for me to get more green peanuts without waiting a year-- and I'll be right back in the same situation next September/October. And yet, I can't bring myself to throw out 10 pounds of peanuts without getting a second opinion.

Puffy, though not super high.\n\nRather  than sausage gravy, I made boeuf bourgignone, Julia-style. I liked the  idea of something as down-home and friendly as a biscuit sopping up something as snobby as boeuf bourgignone. We started with French onion soup  (Julia\u2019s recipe). Then the bourgignone, mashed potatoes, and the  biscuits. Dessert was grasshopper pie (Company\u2019s Coming Pies cookbook).\n\nIt was an absolute hit.

{"title": "I want to cook Biscuits & Gravy, but...", "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm from Poland and I'm in Poland. I never had Biscuits & Gravy and there is no option to buy it here. But my American friends have strongly recommended B&G as a quintessential Southern breakfast. So I've decided to cook it myself.\n\nHowever I wanted some advice what to avoid, what to do etc. And have multiple questions:\n\n1. I will be making breakfast sausage myself, as it is also not available here. I plan to use this recipe: [https://laurenslatest.com/easy-homemade-breakfast-sausage/](https://laurenslatest.com/easy-homemade-breakfast-sausage/) is it any good? I want to get something close to \"real deal\".\n2. I have not chosen biscuits recipe yet. Can I make dough day before? Or do I have to make it fresh?\n3. Also I have doubts about making gravy. Should I remove meat after frying it and just use fat for making white sauce, or should I add flour to the meat and then add milk? Also can I make gravy the day before?\n4. Should I serve it with eggs, and if so sunny side up or flipped? I assume runny yolk.\n\nI'd be grateful for any help in the matter. My plan is Sunday breakfast, so I don't have much time to make additional purchases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd I\u2019ve succeed:) Thanks everyone for advice.

{"title": "How long is too long for pickling pork?", "selftext": "I can't find pickled pork for my red beans & rice anymore, so I decided to make it from scratch (using Alton Brown's recipe: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pickled-pork-recipe-1943188 ). However, I made the mistake of starting it right before one of the busiest times in my entire career. That pork was supposed to pickle for \"3 to 7 days\", but it has now been 14 days. I've been turning it daily, and kept the one little air bubble away from the meat so spoilage shouldn't be an issue. \n\nDoes being in the pickling liquid for that long create any problems/concerns, or can I go ahead and use it? This is partly a food-safety question (which is why I'm not asking another sub) and partly a culinary question (which is why I'm asking this sub). I'm hoping this is just going to make my red beans extra tasty.\n\nEDIT, two months later: The pork was completely fine. I drained it and froze it like normal, then used half of it a few weeks later to make red beans, which were still delicious. (I've added my recipe in a comment below, per a request.) I ate the entire pot myself over the course of about 10 days, and had zero ill effects.\n\nThe only difference from the extra time in the pickling liquid was a noticeably stronger 'pickled' flavor in my finished batch of red beans. I used 1.4 lbs of the meat instead of the 1 lb my recipe calls for, so between the extra meat and the longer pickling time, it imparted a stronger 'pickled' flavor than I wanted, but it was still good. Next time I cook this, I'll stick to the 1 lb of meat; next time I make pickled pork, I'll pickle it for 6 to 8 days.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/j1bmpp/how_long_is_too_long_for_pickling_pork/", "created_utc": 1601298399.0, "score": 15, "author": "ornryactor", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/DixieFood/comments/j1bmpp/how_long_is_too_long_for_pickling_pork/", "html_title": ""}

SignKitchen here--my fiance and I are making a meal tonight in celebration of my Southern food roots on our stream, and I wanted to share the recipe here and drop the link for [SignKitchen](https://twitch.tv/SignKitchen) for anyone interested. (We use both ASL and English, so it's definitely unique!)\n\nAnyway, recipe is as follows!\n\nIngredients:\n\nBBQ Sauce:\n\n* 3 tbsp olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 c ketchup\n* 1/4 c water\n* 1/4 c apple cider vinegar\n* 1/4 c brown sugar\n* 2 tsp paprika\n* 1 tsp smoked paprika\n* 1 tsp chili powder\n* 1 tsp cayenne\n\nShredded BBQ Chicken:\n\n* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast\n* pepper\n* 1 cup chicken broth\n* 1 cup BBQ sauce\n* 1/4 cup molasses\n* 1 tbsp ground ancho chili pepper\n* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon\n\nBrown Butter Pumpkin-Cheddar Grits:\n\n* 2 c chicken broth\n* 1 c old fashioned grits\n* salt to taste\n* 4 tbsp unsalted butter\n* 1 c whole milk\n* 3/4 c pumpkin puree\n* 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg\n* salt and pepper to taste\n* 4-5 oz freshly grated sharp cheddar\n\nDirections:\n\n* To make the BBQ sauce, heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add minced garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and let cook for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer 15 minutes until thickened.\nThis will keep in the fridge for up to a month.\n\n* Sprinkle the chicken breast with pepper and place in large nonstick skillet.\n* In a large bowl, combine broth, BBQ sauce, molasses, ancho, and cinnamon; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or so until thermometer reads 165 degrees. Shred meat and return to skillet.\n\n* Meanwhile, bring 2 cups of broth to a rolling boil and add 1 cup old fashioned grits. Stir vigorously then reduce heat to low and cover. Allow grits to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n* While grits cook, brown butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Let butter melt untouched, then once it starts to simmer and brown, whisk constantly until butter is golden and fragrant. Remove from heat.\n* Once grits absorb broth, add milk and pumpkin puree. Season to taste with salt and grated nutmeg and continue to cook on lowest setting for 5-10 minutes. \n* Stir in 4-5 oz freshly grated cheddar cheese, along with brown butter and adjust salt and pepper to taste.\n* Put grits in a bowl and chicken on top. Enjoy and serve warm!\n\nHope y'all enjoy this recipe as much as we do!
