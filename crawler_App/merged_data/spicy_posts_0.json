{"title": "WARNING: Do NOT do the One Chip Challenge", "selftext": "I realize that some other people have written about their experience here with the OCC and I truly wish I had read some of them prior to doing it myself last night. But alas, I am a dumbass. \n\nI will qualify this post by giving some context for my spice tolerance. I LOVE spicy food. I LOVE fresh hot peppers. I have grown everything from jalape\u00f1os to cayenne peppers all the way up to ghosts and Carolina reapers. I have indulged in them all raw right off the stem, and cooked with them in excess. \n\nThe food I cook for myself on a near daily basis is too hot to serve to guests. I have to make a deliberate effort to reduce the level of spice I add if I have guests or no one can eat my food. I use Extra Hot Franks Red Hot as liberally as one would use ketchup. \nI eat spicy food almost every day and have built up a tolerance much higher than anyone I know IRL for sure. I have a reputation amongst my friends and family for being \u201cdead from the neck up\u201d or having an \u201cass/stomach/mouth of steel\u201d. \n\nOk. With that out of the way, let\u2019s get to this chip. \n\nI have eaten the Paqui ghost pepper chips many times and consider them to be reasonably mild. I expected the OCC to be a very intensified version of that. I was wrong. So wrong. \n\nFirst of all, this thing tastes absolutely disgusting. Truly one of the worst tasting things I\u2019ve ever eaten. The flavour alone is enough to make you puke (more on this later.) It tastes like poison. Maybe what I expect motor oil to taste like. Just awful. \n\nThe \u201cheat\u201d is a weird point to talk about because I didn\u2019t actually find it to be hot at all. Excruciatingly painful? Yes. But the pain is nothing like the spicy sensation you get from hot sauce or chilli peppers. I wouldn\u2019t call it spicy. It just felt like a horrible chemical burn in my throat and on the tip of my tongue. It\u2019s what I imagine it would be like to drink gasoline. Extremely painful but not \u201cspicy\u201d. No gradual build. No hum or sting. No aromatic flavours. Just unbearable burning. Nothing pleasant about it in the least. \n\nMy bottom lip started quiver and my ear canals felt like they were punctured. \n\nI initially reached for water which helped for a brief second as I swallowed but the pain instantly returned as soon as the water left my mouth. I then went for the (non-dairy) milk and wound up guzzling half a carton in seconds. After a minute or two the burning began to subside and was far more like something I would call \u201cvery spicy\u201d but the immediate indigestion from the chip mixed with the large amount of milk was a recipe for disaster. \n\nMy immediate thought was to try to poop it out right away but while sitting on the toilet I started to burp. I grabbed the garbage can off the bathroom floor and violently vomited blue milk into it and on the floor. I projectile puked so hard I overshot the trash can. \n\nThe flavour of the chip coming back up was so disgusting that it caused me to puke even harder. \n\nThen the stomach pain started. Usually when I think about cramps I think about my lower stomach area. But with this chip, the pain was in my upper abdomen and up between my ribs. In addition to being cramped, I had a strong cold burn in my abdomen that felt like the sensation caused my very strong mint gum. I got the chills and started chattering. \n\nI should mention this all happened around 9:30PM. I had eaten a good hearty stir fry around 7:00 so my stomach was certainly not empty. \n\nFor the next two hours I continued to shake, chatter, shit, and burp that god awful flavour. \n\nAt 11:30PM I puked again. REALLY hard. Probably the hardest I\u2019ve ever puked in my life. And out came my entire dinner with chunks of blue tortilla chip in it. Again the awful taste caused me to barf more while I was actively barfing. Barfing from the flavour of your barf is a truly unique and terrible experience I hope to never relive. Bringing the chip back up also reignited the burning in my throat and mouth to a level I absolutely did not want while already feeling so sick. \n\nAt 12:00 I dragged my sorry ass into the shower so exhausted I barely made it out. I literally puked out every ounce of my energy. \n\nI crashed just after 1:00AM, still very nauseous and thinking I might puke again, and thankfully was able to sleep through the night without incident. I was terrified I was going to wake up and vomit everywhere or even shit my bed. Neither happened. \n\nI woke up at 7:30 this morning with some mild lower cramps but generally feeling much better. When I pooped the cramps were relieved but to my surprise I was actually constipated probably because I\u2019m dehydrated from puking so much. \n\nThen came the ass burn. This is not the time to scroll on your phone while sitting on the toilet. Wipe and get it off your skin ASAP. The acid was burning not just my butthole but my butt cheeks and any other skin it contacted. I fully expected to find blood in the toilet, but thankfully there wasn\u2019t any. \n\nIt\u2019s now 9AM. Nearly 12 hours have passed. I feel a lot better but I know I\u2019m not in the clear yet. I\u2019m going to try to eat as bland as possible today and hope that I\u2019m fully past this in the next few hours, but I can already feel another acidic poop brewing. \n\nBasically, eating this chip is not a spicy experience. It is not an interesting test of your heat tolerance (as I hoped it would be). There are literally no good reasons to do it. It is just self induced food poisoning\u2026 or more accurately, capsaicin poisoning. Yes, that\u2019s a real thing. Look it up. And I paid $9 to make myself sicker than I\u2019ve ever been. \n\nBe smarter than me. Don\u2019t do the One Chip Challenge. \n\n\nTLDR: the OCC is just self induced food poisoning. There is no novelty to it. 0/10 would not recommend.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/x4ulhp/warning_do_not_do_the_one_chip_challenge/", "created_utc": 1662212115.0, "score": 1525, "author": "ForeverInBlackJeans", "num_comments": 477, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/x4ulhp/warning_do_not_do_the_one_chip_challenge/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I can never eat spicy food again, goodbye my favourite subreddit", "selftext": "I just recently had a esophagus surgery done due to it being ruptured from throwing up too intensely. \n\nHow it got to that was me and a few buds bought a bunch of hot sauces and peppers for the sake of doing a \u201cspice tolerance challenge.\u201d The winner would be crowned the ruler of spice with a grand total of 100 dollars (20 from each person taking part of the challenge). \n\nWe would first start with mild hot sauces like Saracha up to whole peppers (seed included). After 12 rounds of gruesome pepper and sauce torture, it was just me and my best friend. We had a total of 20 ghost peppers bought, me being the dumbass that I am, I pretty much challenged him saying \u201cbet you I can pop all in one go\u201d and so with a statement like that I couldn\u2019t go back on my word and trusted in my confidence in having years of built up spice tolerance, I thought to myself that I was going to be fine. Man was I so wrong. A handful of ghost peppers thrusted into my mouth and with that I won the challenge by a landslide. I got my 100 bucks and the praise I wanted to hear. Everyone left after that and pretty much the next couple hours were just me and the toilet. I pretty much threw up everything. \n\nThe absolute searing stomach pain was so bad that I couldn\u2019t feel my lower half of my body. I couldn\u2019t take it no more and decided to get myself to the hospital. They ended up finding out that I had a ruptured esophagus from puking so much and had to perform immediate surgery. I went through the surgery and now the doctor is saying that the rupture has damaged my esophagus so badly that it\u2019ll be sensitive to foods not just spice but everything in general. Doc recommended that I never touch spicy food again or else I risk another hospital visit or even death. As well as a diet of liquids and portioned food intake.\n\nSo yeah, this is my goodbye to this subreddit, seeing how I\u2019ll never be able to eat spice again. I really enjoyed my time here, I hope you guys will get something out of this story of mine.

I kind of expected to pop them open at the party as a snack, but there was a lot of food and they were sort of forgotten. The next morning I got up, little foggy from the late night, and as I was making my coffee, I spotted these. I opened up the bag and threw a few in my mouth. I have a decent tolerance.

Stuff like that. This was\u2026 a surprise. These are not a casual snack. I stood in the kitchen for about a minute, then actually excused myself back to the bedroom where I laid down and just breathed through it. Eyes watering, ears burning, and eventually stomach cramps.

I\u2019m no purist. I like pineapple sometimes ffs. \n\nThe thing is, you gotta specify as the restaurant owner. I love fresh jalape\u00f1os, that *taste like jalape\u00f1os* on pizza. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t be playing Russian roulette when ordering because I see \u201cjalapenos\u201d as an available topping. \n\nYeah, I can check every time, find a consistent place with the fresh ones, but I travel a lot.

{"title": "PSA: Don't try the One Chip Challenge.", "selftext": "So like the title says: Don't try the One Chip Challenge.\n\nThis *spicy* journey begins at roughly 11:10 PM EST on Thursday, September 15th. I am in a Discord call with my friends playing some League of Legends maining Neeko (as one does) when I remember the singular spicy chip that I spent $7.99 on a few weeks ago but have yet to try. It is then that I mention the chip to my friends who immediately pressure me to eat said chip.\n\nAfter a few minutes of peer pressure, I decide to eat the chip. It tasted terrible. Like pouring a jar of your grandmother's freshly burned ashes onto a triangle shaped piece of cardboard. However, I continue to chew and swallow the chip until I swallow it. The chip stains my tongue blue as it unleashes a semi-intense spice that lasts roughly 30 minutes. As per the rules of the challenge, I go an hour without eating or drinking anything and am crowned the \"Immortal God of Spice\".\n\nI finally drink something and realize immediately that the dastardly chip had changed my sense of taste and made it numb to both carbonation and really anything intense tasting at all. All else is fine until about 4 AM when I find myself on the toilet emptying my intestinal track of pure hot magma from the firey pits of hell that Satan himself had seemingly placed in my asshole. Now, I am not the most religious person in the least, but I was damn near praying for forgiveness from every God and/or Goddess imaginable in a sheer passionate attempt to end the suffering that I am currently experiencing.\n\nAfter about an hour of clearing my colon and making my legs go numb on the toilet seat that has became hot in temperature from my succulent ass cheeks sitting upon it, I decide to take my keys and drive to the gas station to purchase a bottle of Pepto Bismol, my saving grace. I am going nearly 100 MPH (160 KMH) down the windy roads at 5:30 AM, headlights shining through my foggy windows as I dash past many innocent bystanding cars as if time itself had both simultaneously stopped and sped up at once, clenching my anal sphincter as tight as possible in hopes that I do not empty the steaming pile of soft molten rock that is at the gates of my poor innocent asshole.\n\nI reach the gas station, park my car, run to the counter, purchase the finest bottle of Pepto Bismol Ultra, and chug the entire bottle right there as the cashier stares at me in awe, confusion, and slight fear. After explaining my dire situation to the cashier, I get back into my car and drive home.\n\nAll is well temporarily until I yet again find myself on the toilet emptying the ninth circle of hell into my porcelain throne. While this is happening, something rather peculiar strikes my mind: \"Wait.. I wasn't supposed to chug the entire bottle of Pepto.. was I?\".\n\nIt is at this moment that I begin to panic. I open Chrome and type in the search bar the following query: \"Is it bad to drink an entire bottle of Pepto Bismol?\". I am then met with several Quora articles regarding the subject. Along with several people in the comments telling the posters that are met with the same question as I that I am going to *die*. \n\nI am in full body panic. My heart is racing. I am light headed. My time on this planet is limited. I won't be able to achieve my life dreams of becoming a mediocre film producer in Hollywood that enters fame due to a string of movies featuring short yellow skinned midget people who are mindless slaves to an evil mastermind that wishes to steal the moon. \n\nIt is at this time that I call poison control and explain the dire situation that I am in to the nice man that was unfortunate enough to answer my phone call. After I speak to this man, my question is \"Do you believe this warrants an Emergency Room visit?\". His words shock me. The man immediately says in the coldest most stern voice imaginable: \"Yes. You need to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Your life is in danger.\"\n\nA cold, sharp bolt of lightning strikes every nerve in my body as I quickly pack my bag with my Nintendo Switch, games, charger, bottle of gum, water bottle, and can of Ultra Mango Fiesta Monster, and I rush to my car and head to the hospital. I can feel my consciousness fading as I see the giant red medicinal plus sign associated with hospitals. I park my car, enter the automatically sliding doors, explain the situation to several nurses, give a urine sample, have 5 viles of blood drawn from my veins, and then proceed to be lectured by two nurses about how stupid I am for not only attempting a viral internet challenge, but drinking an entire bottle of Pepto Bismol and a can of Ultra Mango Fiesta Monster on top of that.\n\nI then recieve an EKG, saline, medicine, and am now currently waiting to be admitted to the hospital for an unknown amount of time. My feet are cold, my legs are numb, my eyes are bloodshot, and my stomach is still in pain, but hey, I earned the title of the Immortal Spice God.\n\nTL;DR: I tried the One Chip Challenge, succeeded, shat my intestines out, drank a bottle of Pepto Bismol, and am now hospitalized as a result.\n\n**Update:** I have been released from the hospital after they took 7 vials of my blood and told me I was good to go.

I love the heat! I\u2019ve eaten many habeneros, ghosts, scorpions, reapers\u2026 (my fav is chopped reapers in a burger) but anyways\u2026 nothing compared to the pain of this damn sandwich\u2026 \n\nFirst bite was okay I tasted everything and right when I swallowed was when I started to feel the burn\u2026 my wife looked at me like I should probably not take another bite, I should\u2019ve listened, but I consider myself a spice king so I took another bite. \n\nThat was it. I sat there for 10 minutes constantly drinking that pink Hi-C and inhaling super hard to cool off my mouth. My eyes were watering and I was sweating so much. The chef came around and asked what I got and I couldn\u2019t even talk. Just pain pain pain. He came and gave me a water cup full of whatever slushie they got over there and I\u2019m convinced it saved my life lol. \n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t bad enough I wasn\u2019t buying it. I went the next day and convinced myself I was just being a baby about it\u2026 but nope. Could still only take 2 bites until I tapped out. It is just painful. \n\nVery humbling experience, I am just a spice baby after all. I can\u2019t imagine anyone being able to eat this. All the videos I see on YouTube have to be fake lol (jk props to those who can do it) \n\nI really signed that waiver TWICE thinking they were bullshitting\u2026 the bathroom visits have proved me wrong.

{"title": "I think I was born without capsaicin receptors", "selftext": "I am not trying to brag, I am genuinely upset that I can't feel spice and that I don't know what the heck is wrong with me.\n\nI have never felt heat from eating spicy food. My first time \"letting someone down\" after they gave me hot sauce was around 4yo with my grandpa who gave me tabasco sauce after I asked him what it was. I remember he looked a little shocked and proud that I didn't flinch.\n\nI have a lot of Mexican friends, their families all grow peppers in their garden to make salsa. They store the dried pepper powder in jars. In middle school we tested myself to see what a spoonful of it would do to me. Nothing at all. It just tasted dry and it wasn't a cinnamon challenge spoonful more like a half teaspoon which was according to their family a gnarly amount to attempt.\n\nI won a spicy wing challenge at this local place that opened a few years back. They said $100 to whoever can eat 8 of their spiciest wings in under 10 minutes. I cleaned them off in about 3.\n\nI asked my doctor what was wrong with me and this mf just recommended Howling Rays. They had great collard greens but once again their spiciest chicken did nothing to me. Like most hot chicken joints they had me sign a waver which I'm convinced is just for show.\n\nI have ordered hot sauces online, dried peppers online, eaten habaneros from the store, ordered beyond the spiciest dishes at thai restaurants with the staff staring wide eyed as I consume the whole bowl.\n\nThe best I can do is tell you if it's really spicy, because I can taste a slight bitterness when it's supposedly really hot. I also respond to wasabi and horse radish and cry when cutting onions since those are common questions when I tell people about this.\n\nSo please lmk if anyone out there shares my experience. More importantly recommend me some medical route to discover what is wrong with my taste buds! Every google search lands me results that say \"how to increase spice tolerance\" or \"some people are born with less receptors\" which are not what I want to know! I believe I have ZERO capsaicin receptors. I think I am rare, I am reaching out.\n\nEdits:\n\nI found out yesterday that when people ask me about how it feels coming out the other end they mean that your a-hole burns! I thought they meant indigestion.\n\nHorseradish, wasabi, sourkraut, and dijon mustard all have the same effect on me as they do any other person. I also cry while cutting onions.\n\nI will pepper spray myself this week to get to the bottom of this.\n\nI think I lack TRPV1 receptors, according to [veryparcel](https://www.reddit.com/user/veryparcel/).\n\nThank you [Ciliarycell](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ciliarycell/) for referring me to someone who is currently researching this stuff. He said he could set up some tests.\n\nOthers speculate I have a point mutation in the capsaicin binding site of TRPV1 without affecting the other functions of the channel. I have a fools grasp on what that means.\n\n[fetalalcoholsoup](https://www.reddit.com/user/fetalalcoholsoup/) supplied the cash for this [chilli extract](https://www.grimreaperfoods.com/chilli-extract/affliction-9-million-scoville-chilli-extract.html) to see if I really am immune. I will try this before the pepper spray because many people shared concern and advice on how to it safely so I need to prepare.\n\nThe scary 9 million scoville extract has arrived\n\nI tried the scary sauce and I did have a reaction! Very exciting, although it was minimal. My tongue temporarily went numb and I began sweating. I felt no \u201cheat\u201d sensation.

I\u2019ve previously reviewed the same brand\u2019s Amarilla habanero sauce and enjoyed it so I was looking forward to this red variety as I typically enjoy the flavor of red habaneros even more than the orange and yellow variety.\n\nOne of the things I really enjoy about Butterfly Bakery of Vermont is there continual release of special micro-batch hot sauces with innovative flavor combinations. The limited-time availability of these does result in me spending more money with them than I would otherwise, but while I never got into Pokemon I do have the \u201cgotta catch \u2019em all\u201d attitude when it comes to hot sauces. This one piqued my interest as I love rosemary and dark leafy greens and it features a pepper I hadn\u2019t tried yet.\n\nThe Hungarian Wax Pepper, the source of heat in this sauce, is a thick-skinned pepper from Hungary with a heat level approximately that of a jalapeno. A member of Capsicum Annuum like jalapenos it\u2019s flavor is said to be similar to that of a bell pepper but spicier and with some sweet and tangy flavor elements as well. In addition to those peppers the other ingredient of special note here is the kale. Having been born in and still having lots of family in the southeastern USA I grew up enjoying collard greens, turnip greens, mustard greens, and more. While kale has has somehow managed to brand itself as the Los Angeles health food smoothie version of that type of green while the others maintain their soul food roots they\u2019re all very similar vegetables with earthy, meaty, and bitter flavor elements. This sauce has a medium-thin consistency with some nice bits of pepper and vegetables inside and an aroma that has some earthiness as well as the fresh evergreen scent of the rosemary.\n\nWhen I open up a green hot sauce I desire a super fresh and bright green flavor. Butterfly Bakery of Vermont Wax Pepper Kale Rosemary Hot Sauce isn\u2019t that, but that\u2019s not a bad thing in this case. Pouring more olive green than viridian this is a very earthy take on a green sauce both in appearance and flavor. The Hungarian wax peppers don\u2019t seem to have a very pronounced flavor but they do bring some vegetal notes which blend well with the earthy bitter flavor of the kale. The mild garlic flavor of the garlic scapes adds to that savory flavor. The rosemary is the real magic ingredient in this mix. The woody notes anchor down with the earthy flavor of the kale while the evergreen forest and herbal flavors help elevate everything and add that fresh element the sauce needs. Add a nice strong vinegar tang and the result is a sauce that\u2019s darker on the flavor spectrum than other green sauces but with enough freshness and zing to keep it exciting.\n\nDespite some strong flavors in play in this sauce I found it to be pretty flexible in terms of pairing. I found this sauce especially great with chicken salad. One of my favorite light dinners lately has been an avocado stuffed with chicken salad (similar to the Peruvian Palta Rellena con Pollo) and Wax Pepper Kale Rosemary Hot Sauce provides great depth and contrast to the creamy chicken salad. This is also a great sauce for chicken. Chicken and rosemary are a classic combination and chicken and kale often share a plate so this isn\u2019t surprising. A pairing that did surprise me with how well it worked was this sauce with tomato soup, the earthy bitter notes working perfectly against the brighter acidic tomato flavor.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend Butterfly Bakery of Vermont Wax Pepper Kale Rosemary Hot Sauce. Not only is it unique in terms of a green sauce it\u2019s also delicious and, thankfully, still available for purchase on their site at the time of this posting.

{"title": "High Desert Sauce Co - Smoky Chiltepin - OBITUARY REVIEW", "selftext": "Here lies HDSC Smoky Chiltepin - \n\n7.7/10\n\nI first met this sauce at Hot Sauce Werks in St Louis, and this is the first sauce I've tried from this brand. I was excited to pick this up, because I don't often see Chiltepin used in a sauce, and I think it's a seriously underused pepper. I burned through this one in less than a week, pun fully intended. The colors on this label are my favorites- burnt orange to yellow- and also, I enjoy the simplistic aesthetic. Overall probably the most visually pleasing bottles I've laid eyes upon. Let's get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: Right at the start, I knew this sauce would be easy to gobble down. This one has a nice medley of ingredients that team up to make a really compelling dance behind the teeth. The acidity shines with this. The first ingredient is tomatoes, which made me cautious at first. I thought it might be watered down and nearly flavorless, but I'm glad I was wrong. This sauce is on the thicker and chunkier side, and I relate to that. I'm not ashamed to say that this is like a really good salsa. If you put this in a tub and slapped a salsa label on it, nobody would bat an eye. And I mean this completely as a compliment! I was able to pick out the ancho and chiltepin pepper flavors through this experience. As I said before, I sucked this sauce down really quickly, as it paired really well with the breakfast burritos I use as a constant for my reviews here, and it's also not very hot. Advertised as medium, but i'd say it's on the med-high end of mild. I've hyped this sauce up this whole time. It's good. If you like sauces that have a lot of flavors yet don't feel overcrowded, this one is for you. Slight sweetness from the carrots and onion, and seasonings that match perfectly with most tacos or mexican food in general. Sharp vegetable bite from the peppers and lime juice. I will say it didn't taste very smokey, although I can taste that paprika specifically. Rest in Peace, Spicy Prince\n\nFeel free to recommend other sauces by High Desert Sauce Co.

{"title": "Char Man Original - OBITUARY", "selftext": "Here lies Char Man Original -\n\n8.7/10\n\nI first met this sauce when I ordered it through the Heat hot sauce shop. This was essentially a part of my Christmas bonus for staying in the building for like 70 hours due to a storm. I knew it was love at first sight. This was near the top of my priority list to try, and when I got the opportunity, I reached out at grabbed it. I always appreciate the paper labels that some brands use. It has a nice a nice feel to it, and in the writing hobby, we would say it has a lot of tooth, which means its has a more rough texture. I really enjoy the appearance of the branding, and the tidbit of story on the label made me smile. Let's get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: The name of the brand is apparent when you try this sauce. You can tell these peppers were actually roasted, as there are bits of char throughout the sauce, and you can even see the flakes on the photo. It has a char taste, without any smoked flavor, so it's likely they used gas flame to achieve this. I'd LOVE to also see a \"smoked\" version of this sauce as well, and I'm not complaining at all, I actually liked this one the way it is. The site itself advertised this as a sauce leaning sweet, but I personally didn't get too much sweetness, although when I did some tastebud investigation, I could tell there was that sugar flavor hidden in there. That being said, I think it is really well balanced. It appears that this sauce has more ingredients than what I'd normally detect. The garlic was there, but the lemon juice didn't really make much of an appearance, but again, that may be because this sauce is so well balanced that the flavors are an amalgamation, and the product is greater than the sum of its parts. Usually when I see people talk about this sauce, it's always hyped up as a daily everything sauce, and I can see why. I would crawl from the ashes to get this sauce again, but for now - Rest in Peace, Spicy Prince\n\nUse the comments and feel free to recommend other sauce varieties by Char Man.

Let's get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: The ingredients on this one are pretty self-explanatory. I will start off by saying that this sauce has a pure sugar sweetness to it. I would've ranked this higher if it appealed to me a little more. The sweetness kinda threw me off, but it was still a great sauce overall! The habanero taste was the second thing that hit me. Usually hab sauce is pretty heat forward, but this one had more of a build up for me. With that said, just from my observation, this sauce is typically advertised as being pretty hot, but I would say this one lands just a smidgen hotter than smack in the middle for a hab sauce.

{"title": "The Spicy Shark - Habanero - OBITUARY", "selftext": "Here lies The Spicy Shark Habanero\n\n6.7/10\n\nI grabbed this sauce at a local jerky place. I love that shop, and while it doesn't have a huge selection, the ones they do have is great! Great white sharks and I have something in common, and that's the fact that we have a great sense of smell. Without fail, before I take a bite of any hot sauce, I'll give it a nice long sniff straight from the bottle. For me, this is a great way to analyze the prominence of ingredients even more than tasting it. Much like a shark, I am an apex predator, and my prey of choice is hot sauce. Lets get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: I did my tasting of this sauce a while ago, so it's not necessarily fresh in my mind, so I'm reading from my notes. Right from the jump, I remember this sauce not being as hot as I expected. That's not a bad thing, and I remember being happy with the taste itself. I love bell peppers in a sauce, as it creates a nice fruity vegetal quality that I would include if I ever made a sauce. This sauce has a genuinely good balance of sweet and heat. It has different layers of sweetness instead of a punch from just one ingredient. The carrots, banana, and lemon really curb the bite from the peppers. This sauce has a particular creamy quality, I suspect from the banana, pectin, and oil combination. I dare say it was almost like a smoothie! The vinegar levels in this sauce are pretty subdued, and the heat is on the lower side of medium. The fennel and ginger add another layer of engaging flavors that go well together. This sauce could be an \"everything\" sauce for most people, but I also think this sauce would really shine on specific food items as well. I put this on my rotation list, so when I end up buying this sauce again, I think I'll use it on some grilled lamb skewers.

Always happy to help support a good cause and because I do love garlic pepper sauces I decided to order a couple of bottles (as well as some CaJohn\u2019s sauces that were involved in the support campaign I believe).\n\nThis sauce has a thin smooth texture, similar to Louisiana style sauces such as Crystal or Frank\u2019s. The aroma is similar to Louisiana styles also but with a sharper hint from the habanero peppers. Speaking of those peppers, aged habaneros are the primary ingredient in this sauce, joined with carrots, onion, and garlic, all in their dehydrated form. Going with all dehydrated vegetables is an interesting choice as dried ones always have a different flavor than fresh, but the use of dried aromatics does allow the sauce to be more liquid by eliminating the vegetable pulp that fresh ingredients would bring. Perhaps for a sauce meant to be used to accompany barbecue the desire was to have something similar in texture to traditional sauces like Crystal, and they succeeded on that front.\n\nBiscuits, Brisket, and Beer Garlic Pepper Sauce reminds me of Louisiana or Cajun style hot sauces when it comes to the flavor as well. Texture has a big impact on flavor and with the smooth liquid nature of this sauce it has that same quick heat and salty vinegary tang that Louisiana style sauces have. The habaneros do give it some differences \u2013 there\u2019s more of a heat punch hear, and there are some fruity elements from the habaneros that you don\u2019t get from cayenne. The inclusion of the carrots, onions, and garlic do take it a bit away from a traditional Louisiana style sauce, but this doesn\u2019t taste like a Caribbean style pepper sauce despite those being common ingredients in those. I believe with all of the aromatics being dehydrated their flavor impact isn\u2019t nearly as large as it would have been were they fresh. The sauce is still very enjoyable, just with a fairly simple and straightforward flavor profile that\u2019s essentially a kicked-up Louisiana style sauce.\n\nBeing a straightforward habanero sauce I expected this to be flexible and it is. It\u2019s amazing as a wing sauce of course, taking the basic cayenne based wing sauce to the next level with habaneros, and the liquid smoothness is a good thing in that application. Since this is the house sauce for a barbecue restaurant I had to try it with barbecue as well. It\u2019s a great sauce for pulled pork, similar in that NC Style pepper vinegar sauces used in their pulled pork (and far superior to the sweet sticky thick sauces so many places unfortunately drown their pulled pork in). This was also great with some sliced brisket. The tangy brightness of this sauce is a great counterpoint to fatty and smoky meats.\n\nI can recommend Biscuits, Brisket, and Beer Garlic Pepper Sauce. I have a suspicion that this is just a white label sauce by Hot Shots Distributing / United Sauces but it\u2019s still a quality sauce and a nice change of pace from the chunkier thicker sauces I\u2019ve been enjoying lately. and always good to have something around with a more simple flavor profile that\u2019s easy to pair with many dishes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4fhua", "created_utc": 1745247227.0, "score": 10, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1k4fhua/biscuits_brisket_and_beer_garlic_pepper_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pickups from last weekend\u2019s Pinellas Pepper Fest", "selftext": "\nDrove up to Tampa for the Pinellas Pepper Fest this past weekend.   While I have too many sauces already I couldn\u2019t help picking some more up, especially since I found a lot of local Florida brands I wasn\u2019t familiar with (plus some others from around the Southeast).  \n\nI tried a ton of samples and some that really struck me are:\n\nThe Mirchi sauces from My Spice Buds. They taste sort of like what Indian pickles would be as hot sauces.  Very unique and flavorful.  \n\nDivine Pepper had two sauces with peppers I haven\u2019t had sauces made with before - one with Malagueta peppers and one with Wiri Wiri peppers.  Again unique and tasty.  \n\nPowerful Pepper Company\u2019s Chipotle Black Garlic Ghost is an umami bomb in a bottle and their This One XII is made from a combo of hot and super hot chiles from their own garden.  Fresh and pepper-forward.  They also have a great fresh tasting salsa with some good heat. \n\nI\u2019ve never been a big fan of Sriracha as a style, but the Sriracha from More-Ish Sauce Co really impressed me with flavor and by being barely sweet at all.  \n\nThe Here Fishy Fishy and Sinister Jack are both from Love Sauce, and they really need to work on their branding because you\u2019d have no idea looking at the bottles.   Here Fishy Fishy is very mustard forward while Sinister Jack has a sweet hot ghost pepper thing going on with pumpkin and fall spices.  \n\nThe Garlic Goodness and Hot Cubed are both from Saucey Queen and again they need to do a much better job letting people know that on the front of the bottle.  Garlic Goodness is one of the most garlicky sauces I\u2019ve tried.  \n\nThe dude from So-Yum who makes the Green Papaya sauce was a class act.  I accidentally dropped my bottle and it shattered, and when I went back to buy a replacement he wouldn\u2019t take my money and just gave me one.  \n\nTennessee Bob\u2019s makes a ton of sauces that are inspired by people in his life and who he\u2019s met selling sauces on the road.  The G Sauce is designed a pizza sauce and has a ton of oregano in it, really interesting flavor.  \n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any questions anyone has about the event.  It was a blast and looking forward to going again next year.

For anyone who is looking for a hotter version, look no further. It's hotter and has a better taste in my humble opinion. This sauce can go on just about anything you'd want it to. It's fairly basic, so this review cant go too deep. It's thin, and has no real sweetness at all. It SAYS it has other ingredients in there, but I had a hard time detecting anything more than vinegar, peppers, and salt. The other flavors probably just round it out more. I was trying hard to taste the carrot, because I love that in a sauce. This sauce is pretty baller for being so simple and cheap. New standard for me!

{"title": "Boar's Head Jalapeno - OBITUARY", "selftext": "Here lies Boar's Head Jalapeno -\n\n5.3/10\n\nI was stoked to learn Boar's Head had a hot sauce. Their deli meats have always been a staple, and their quality has always been the standard. I locked eyes with this sauce in a small sandwich shop. My coworkers were gushing about the place all day, milking how much they loved the place. The sandwiches were admittedly pretty mid, but, I had one good takeaway, and that is this sauce. Lets get into the review\n\nREVIEW: While I gave this an average score, I enjoyed this sauce for what it was. Immediate brand appeal is what hooked me. This sauce truly showcases what a person means when they say a pepper is \"fruity\". Not exactly sweet, but it has a certain vegetal quality that is hard to describe. The heat level on this sauce is on the lower end of mild. The vinegar isn't in your face, and as my review-rival Magnus pointed out, the \"spices\" are mysterious and hard to determine exactly what they are, although I believe the blend is mostly paprika with a little onion powder, which leans into that vegetal aspect. You'll see there aren't many ingredients in this one. The consistency of the sauce is creamy, but by viscous nature, not taste. The sauce seems a little salty, but I suspect it appears that way because there aren't any competing flavors. I do believe this sauce would be good as a base for mixing. Whether it's another hot sauce, a tomato sauce for pastas, or even to jazz up some mayo for a nice boar's head sandwich. While I was eating this sauce, I thought it would go well with some strong mustard or their horseradish. That would really wake this sauce up.

Due to concern they could carry a disease detrimental to US citrus their import was banned between 1968 and 2005. My interest in more exotic foods grew during that time period from the late \u201990s to early \u201900s and I longed to taste these magical little morsels that were the key to the Ma (numbing) in traditional Sichuan (though at the time predominantly westernized as Szechuan) Ma La (or numbing and spicy) cuisine.\n\nWhen the import ban lifted my hopes of a surge of authentic Sichuan restaurants flooding the market to rescue us from General Tso\u2019s Chicken and the like were short lived. Turns out Americans by and large like way-too-sweet Americanized Chinese food and don\u2019t want to expand their culinary frontiers to new and interesting sensations. 50Hertz hopes to change that. Started by a Chinese American originally from Chongqing, known for its Sichuan cuisine, and named for the frequency that the Sichuan peppercorns are said to create numbing, their goal is to share the wonderful flavor and sensation of Sichuan peppercorns with the world.\n\nThe 50Hertz Tingly Peanuts make use of both green and red Sichuan peppercorns. The red are the more common variety with an earthier flavor with citrus overtones while the green have a stronger more floral and citrusy aroma and a stronger numbing sensation. In addition these contain some chili peppers for heat and MSG to increase the umami flavor and interestingly rosemary oil, though I don\u2019t get any strong rosemary flavors.\n\nThe peanuts themselves are plump with good texture and crunch. The tin contains quite a few Sichuan peppercorns which add more crunch and a little bit of chew. The Sichuan peppercorns are simultaneously earthy, citrusy, mineral, savory, umami, and pungent. The numbing tingly effect is pronounced and interesting in that it also seems to change the flavor of other foods and beverages enjoyed within a certain time period. Taking a drink of water after eating some of the tingly peanuts gives the water a mineral citrusy and slightly metallic flavor for instance. The amount and type of chili peppers used doesn\u2019t bring them to the front of the flavor spectrum. There\u2019s a very mild heat and some tiny chili flavor in the background but these are much more Ma than La. I\u2019d love to see the company release a version of these with some real heat \u2013 perhaps some dried Chinese Heaven Facing peppers which are often used in Sichuan cuisine, or even ghost peppers to really give them a kick. There is a nice umami flavor as well as the bright citrus and numbing notes, these are packed with flavors and will likely be unlike any other peanuts you\u2019ve tried.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend 50Hertz Tingly Foods Tingly Peanuts. They use high quality peanuts, a large number of high quality Sichuan peppercorns, and provide a taste and physical sensation that\u2019s unique to that product.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jugjkh", "created_utc": 1744126591.0, "score": 31, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1jugjkh/50hertz_tingly_foods_tingly_peanuts_review/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Strong Carolina reaper shot", "selftext": "I was at a party yesterday pretty drunk, where some guy came up to me with a glass bottle filled up with maybe 1.5 inches of  this dark coloured liquid. He claimed it was his own homemade vodka mixed with 4 large Carolina reapers and extremely strong and potent. Me being drunk I did not refuse to take a shot of this, so the guy poured 3 shot glasses for me him and his friend to have. \nA little side note I'm not used to spicy food, maybe some sirachia sauce on my noodles rarely. So I did not realise what I just got myself into. \nI was rethikining taking it but then the guy told me that a girl I knew in that party had a double shot earlier, in my head I could not back down at this point.\nI neck the shot, and didn't feel anything for a second just the liquid going back down into my stomach, I forgot to eat anything since breakfast at like 13:00 so I felt it hit my stomach with a bang before I felt the flames of the pepper start to creep up my throat and set my mouth alight. I felt like my innards became the pits of hell. I tried to play it off by pouring another shot for my friend and as a little prank used my cup that had 2 drops left in there. With my body going into shutdown mode I got this drink to my friend and told him to drink it, I then managed to get to the toilet with two ice cubes in my hand and a cup of juice. That toilet became the closest thing I can describe to torture, my stomach cramping my mouth and throat burning and me just wishing for the end of this nightmare. I resulted to calling my other friends who werent at the party and as soon as they heard what I did they started bursting out laughing, completely ignoring my pleads for help and advice. I then slammed down on the end call button and heard my other friend who I gave the drink to shouting to me through the door \"WHAT DID YOU GIVE ME, IT BURNS SO MUCH. ACTUALLY WHAT IS THIS.\" I open the door to let him in ordering him to help me throw up whatever I just consumed out of my system. \nI then leave the toilet after about 15 minutes of rethinking some of the choices I have made in my life and throwing up this concoction that I want to call the devils piss. I searched for the two other guys who took the shot with me, they had apparently found some milk right after they took it givinf them what I think would've been a more pleasant experience.\nI learnt a lot from this, the main thing being to not take homemade mixtures off sketchy looking people at social gatherings.

But I\u2019m curious what other people on this sub think, and even more curious what those with more exposure to Nashville hot style think of Dave\u2019s compared to other places?\n\nI think for me I\u2019m gonna stick to buffalo style chicken when I\u2019m craving a spicy sandwich ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/1jmbvmn/anyone_else_not_super_impressed_by_the_flavor_of/", "created_utc": 1743213732.0, "score": 31, "author": "AmishHomage", "num_comments": 43, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1jmbvmn/anyone_else_not_super_impressed_by_the_flavor_of/", "html_title": ""}

He was one of the first to popularize cajun and creole cooking in the United States outside of Louisiana\u2019s area of influence and a mentor to Emeril Lagasse who would eventually carry on that role. His signature blackened redfish dish became so popular with so many imitators that strict limitations had to be set on commercial fishing of the species lest it go extinct. While he produced a range of dry seasonings that were (and in some places still are) common sights on grocery store shelves I wasn\u2019t aware that there was also a hot sauce until a recent Reddit post made me aware of it. I decided it was something I had to try.\n\nBased on the bottle shape, color, and the Paul Prudhomme\u2019s cuisine I was expecting this to be a Louisiana style sauce and that\u2019s more or less what it is. There are some notable variations in this compared to Crystal or Lousiana however. First the pepper blend includes both habaneros and cayenne, with habaneros being rare to see in Louisiana style sauces (though they do appear in the Poirier\u2019s Louisiana Style as well). Second is the inclusion of onion and garlic powders, nice seasonings for any sauce to be sure, but most Louisiana style sauces are just peppers, vinegar, and salt. Third, there\u2019s the cane syrup, which isn\u2019t something I can recall every seeing in that style of sauce. The color and texture are very much reminiscent of Louisiana style sauces however, as is the aroma, though that little bit of garlic and onion do poke through.\n\nThe habaneros have a great impact on the flavor of Chef Paul Prudhomme Magic Pepper Sauce. They bring their quick bite of heat and vegetal fruity nature to the front of the sauce\u2019s flavor profile while the vinegar tang and cayenne peppers solidify the roots of the sauce as that Louisiana style. The sweetness from the cane syrup is surprisingly a welcome addition to the sauce. I\u2019m not normally a fan of sweetness in savory sauces but it\u2019s subtle enough that it rounds out the flavor profile with also softening the vinegar tang a bit to make it less aggressive. The onion and garlic elements aren\u2019t at the forefront but they do add a nice savory backdrop to the sauce and make it taste richer and more full. The heat level is as expected for a Louisiana style sauce pretty minimal.\n\nThe beauty of this type of sauce is that they\u2019re extremely flexible. I enjoyed this on pizza, eggs, a ham and cheese sandwich, and even just a toasted bagel with some butter. One of the surprising places I found it worked very well was to add just the right amount of kick and extra acidity to some Chinese takeout wonton soup that I felt was just a little on the bland side before. There are unfortunately no cajun or creole restaurants in my area any longer since the only one we had shut down, but this has prompted me to consider making my own jambalaya.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend Chef Paul Prudhomme Magic Pepper Sauce. It\u2019s a tasty take on the Louisiana style sauce with some liberties taking to give it a unique flavor while still staying true to the style overall. This sauce is also all natural with no artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, or thickeners.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jitaem", "created_utc": 1742829844.0, "score": 24, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1jitaem/chef_paul_prudhomme_magic_pepper_sauce_review/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Various spicy foods, grouped by heat level", "selftext": "We all have different levels of heat tolerance, and something I love about this sub and other similar ones is that I can find so many new spicy things to try. The downside is that it can be hard to gauge how hot something is relative to my own spice tolerance, as what someone might consider seriously hot I might consider fairly mild, and yet someone else might consider something kind of hot while it would have me on my knees. Here, I've put together a list roughly grouping popular items I see on Reddit + commonly eaten restaurant items by what I'd consider to be similar levels of heat based on my own experience consuming them. The title of each tier is my own personal opinion on how hot that level of heat is, so take that as you will. Hopefully this can provide a better frame of reference as to how hot something is in comparison to something else (I.e, \"I've had one thing in this tier, so the other things in this tier are probably a similar experience\"). Of course, this is just my own personal take on each of these items and others may debate the placement of some, but hopefully it's accurate enough. Additionally,  I added asterisks to the ones I eat on a frequent basis and can speak about the most confidently. \n\n##Legitimately Mild - Smallest Hint of Heat\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Banana Pepper\n- Jalape\u00f1o (mild)*\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Trader Joe\u2019s Ghost Pepper Chips\n- Spicy Campbell\u2019s Chunky Soups\n- Chick-fil-A Spicy Chicken Sandwich/Biscuit*\n- Store-bought Red Pepper Flakes*\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings - Cajun*\n- Wingstop - Cajun*\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Yellow or Black Label Valentina\n- Cholula\n- Texas Pete\n- Tabasco\n- Louisiana Hot Sauce\n- Sriracha*\n\n##Slight Heat - Very Easy to Eat\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Jalape\u00f1o (hot)*\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Flamin\u2019 Hot anything*\n- Takis*\n- Tin Drum Pad Thai Spice Level 3*\n- Campbell\u2019s Ghost Pepper Chicken Noodle Soup\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Zaxby\u2019s - Tongue Torch*\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Melinda\u2019s Ghost Pepper Wing Sauce\n- Melinda\u2019s Fire Roasted Garlic & Habanero*\n- Melinda\u2019s Habanero\n- Marie Sharpe\u2019s Habanero*\n- Secret Aardvark \n- Tabasco Habanero\n- Yellowbird Habanero\n- Trader Joe\u2019s Peri Peri\n\n##Decent Heat - Mild Enough to Eat a Lot of Without Any Struggle, But Hot Enough to Feel Satisfied\n**Food/Snacks**\n- XXTRA Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos*\n- Tin Drum Tikka Masala Spice Level 3*\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings Thai Curry*\n- Zaxby\u2019s Nuclear*\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Trader Joe\u2019s Habanero*\n- Melinda\u2019s Ghost Pepper*\n\n##Solid Heat - Not Bad in Moderate Doses but A Lot Can Be Tougher\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Thai Chili*\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Buldak 2x Ramen\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings Wild*\n- Wingstop Atomic*\n- Hattie B\u2019s Damn Hot\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Tabasco Scorpion*\n\n##Gonna Need A Good Tolerance to Enjoy Properly\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Habanero*\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings Blazin\u2019 Knockout*\n- Hattie B\u2019s Shut the Cluck Up\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Torchbearer Garlic Reaper*\n- Torchbearer Zombie Apocalypse\n- Da Bomb\n\n##Only Eat For Challenge Purposes \n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Carolina Reaper\n- Ghost Pepper\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Death Nut\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Elijah\u2019s Xtreme Regret Reserve\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/1jizngr/various_spicy_foods_grouped_by_heat_level/", "created_utc": 1742844963.0, "score": 11, "author": "Shrekscoper", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1jizngr/various_spicy_foods_grouped_by_heat_level/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Recipe for homemade American Cheese infused with superhot Dragon's Breath chiles", "selftext": "So the other day on a whim I decided to try making some chile pepper infused American Cheese. It's not always my go-to cheese but there's something to be said for that ooey gooy consistency. In the end it was probably more effort than I'd exert on a regular basis, but it was a fun science experiment that resulted in one of the tastiest (and most face-melting-iest) grilled cheese sandwiches I've had in awhile.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k431mgc72wpe1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd74dec4aa982f28974a37f9d6b78e1d9c78551e\n\nAmerican cheese uses sodium citrate to emulsify the base cheese (often cheddar or colby) with a liquid, allowing it to melt much quicker. I didn't want to buy sodium citrate for this one experiment, so I searched reddit and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/2pxh99/how_to_make_sodium_citrate_from_baking_soda_and/) on making sodium citrate with baking soda and citric acid (which I happen to have industrial quantities of). Combining that information with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/7gxetm/comment/dqmkx5p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about ratios of cheese to liquid for various consistencies (ranging from cheese sauce to sliceable cheese), I was able to come up with this recipe:\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 oz shredded sharp cheddar (you can get creative with cheese combos here)\n* 2 tbsp half and half (you could use water, milk, etc)\n* 2.5 g baking soda\n* 2.1 g citric acid (you could try using lemon juice or vinegar here, though I'm not sure about optimal ratios)\n* 3 g Dragon's Breath chile flakes (this results in serious heat, so you can use less or use a milder chile flake depending on your tolerance)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. First, add the liquid to a pan. Then measure the baking soda and citric acid and let them react. It'll foam up for a bit and then settle. You have now have sodium citrate in a liquid. Doesn't look appetizing, but I didn't detect any baking soda flavor in the final product.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yeaw6gp0wpe1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=00bfb3f90ff16342892332377e0e571d79a0e002\n\n2.

Then add the cheese and stir vigorously to combine. Keep the heat on low and be careful not to let it burn. It'll start out barely combined and then will melt into a thick sauce.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy4h4zvs4wpe1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb1d57ffc9dbe70a3077e9e42d9b964474e84672\n\n4.

The following is from google.\n\n\"Capsaicin cramps, resulting from consuming too much spicy food, can manifest as burning sensations, internal irritation, abdominal pain, and potentially nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. \n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown: \n\nGastrointestinal Symptoms:\nAbdominal pain and cramps: Capsaicin can stimulate pain receptors in the gut, leading to discomfort and cramping.\n\nNausea and vomiting: In some cases, excessive capsaicin intake can trigger nausea and even vomiting.\n\nDiarrhea: The burning sensation and irritation in the gut can lead to increased bowel movements and diarrhea.\n\nBurning sensation: Capsaicin directly interacts with pain receptors, causing a burning sensation in the mouth, throat, and potentially the stomach.\n\nOther Potential Symptoms:\n\nChest pain: In some cases, a burning sensation in the chest can occur due to capsaicin binding with pain receptors in the esophagus.\n\nSwelling of the throat: Swelling of the throat, making breathing difficult and/or causing hoarseness of voice.\n\nSeverity:\nThe intensity of these symptoms can vary depending on the amount of capsaicin consumed and individual sensitivity.\"\n\nThis is fairly accurate but doesn't do justice to just how painful these can be. Depending on the amount of capsaicin consumed, your experience could be as mild as a little belly ache, all the way up to having it feel like knives are carving up your insides. This feeling will pass, even if it takes hours. You do not need medical attention, and there's nothing a doctor can do for you.\n\nThe only way to truly get rid of cap cramps is to get it out of your system.  This means making yourself sick until you vomit it up and out of your system. After a chili pod eating competition, contestants will try to make themselves sick to prevent cap cramps from starting. But, if they've already started, it's not too late to purge. Some people think pickle juice helps to lessen their severity, or dairy like yogurt or ice cream. This can help, but purging is the best. \n\nYou also can help yourself by prepping a bit before indulging in spice. Some people say greasy food before helps, or taking a tablespoon or two of olive oil. I like to eat something that's a little greasy and high in carbs (well chewed pizza) before eating a stupid amount of capsaicin. The important thing is to make sure whatever you prep with is easy for you to purge out later.\n\nAlso, people can experience cap cramps differently. I always get them within two hours of eating stupid amounts of capsaicin but some of my friends won't get them until the following day even though a similar level of capsaicin was eaten. I get waves of cap cramps, intense pain that goes away for a bit then comes back just as you thought you were all better. The most I've had, or at least the most I remember counting was eight waves.

{"title": "Seed Ranch Truffle Hound review", "selftext": "Bitter: \u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nSalty: \u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nSour: \u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nSweet: \u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nUmami: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nHeat: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nQuick Flavor Notes: Earthy, garlicky, umami, rich, smoky\n\nTexture: Medium with a smooth texture\n\nIngredients: Crushed Tomato, Water, White Vinegar, Truffle Pepper Blend (ghost pepper, chile de arbol, summer truffles (tuber aestivum), salt, vegetable fiber, organic and natural truffle flavor), Dates, Carrots, Garlic, Rice Vinegar, Olive Oil, Chickpea Miso (rice koji, chickpeas, sea salt, water, koji spores, seaweed), Sea Salt, Nutritional Yeast, Smoked Paprika, Konjac\n\nRecommended: Yes\n\nSeed Ranch out of Boulder, CO brands themselves as a \u201cFlavor Company\u201d rather thana hot sauce company. That flavor-first philosophy has been evident in all of the sauces from Seed Ranch that I\u2019ve tried thus far. While their sauces may not bringing scorching heat I\u2019ve always found them to have innovating and delicious flavor combinations. Because of the great track record I\u2019ve had with their products I decided to take a risk on them with a style of hot sauce that\u2019s perhaps the most difficult to actually do well \u2013 a truffle hot sauce.\n\nSeed Ranch Truffle Hound does use real black truffles in the sauce along with a bevy of other umami-rich ingredients including chickpea miso, nutritional yeast, and seaweed. The sauce has a tomato base and uses a combination of ghost peppers and chiles de arbol for the heat. The sauce is medium in consistency and smooth in texture with olive oil adding a particular creaminess and silkiness. Also interesting is the use of Konjac, a Japanese yam with a unique texture, as an all natural thickener. The aroma is earthy with small hints of sweetness and heat. I have to also give credit to Seed Ranch for their striking logo design for this product.\n\nThe flavor of Seed Ranch Truffle Hound is earthy, complex, intensely umami, savory, and just a little bit sweet. The earthy forest floor flavor of the black truffles comes forward immediately, accented by the smokiness of the ghost peppers and chiles de arbol. The tomatoes and rice wine vinegar bring some tanginess and acidity without making this an acid-forward sauce. The miso emphasizes that deep umami flavor of the truffles and adds a foundation to the sauce as well as a little bit of sweetness along with the dates and carrots. The garlic flavor comes through after the first wave leaving the sauce with a savory finish. This is one of the most complex hot sauces I\u2019ve ever tasted, with a long finish as the tastes change as new elements crest over the palate. Despite having ghost peppers the heat level of this sauce is on the milder side of medium.\n\nWith the earthy umami-bomb flavors in this sauce I felt that grilled meats would be a perfect first pairing. Truffle Hound is a great accompaniment for grilled steaks and pork chops. Adding a solid dollop into a bowl of chili gave it a deeper more developed flavor. I found it was also great with some Tallarin Saltado (think a Latin take on Lo Mein) though I found in that case adding a bit of Marie Sharp\u2019s Belizean Heat as well to add some brightness had the best effect. While Seed Ranch Truffle Hound has a powerful taste it also blends well with foods that go well with mushrooms as well as foods that have some of those earthy umami flavor elements already.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend Seed Ranch Truffle Hound. It\u2019s by far the tastiest truffle hot sauce that I\u2019ve tried thus far and with the unique spin of adding miso as well it becomes an umami tour-de-force. Truffle Hound is all natural with no artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, or thickeners.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j89uqh", "created_utc": 1741641811.0, "score": 24, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1j89uqh/seed_ranch_truffle_hound_review/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Dave's hot chicken Reaper Review#12345", "selftext": "I never had Dave's Hot chicken before since it opened near me \\~2 months ago. Had a long week at work and it was 9pm so why not try it for the 1st time and start from the top. Got the Reaper combo with a side of their sauce and 1 frozen slushy(best decision)They print out two(2) copies of this wavier and make you sign and date both but you need to a minimum do it to one they keep. After waited 5 minutes for the to-go box. Only thing that worried me was since the to-go box held the sandwich and the fries, the fries would get the reaper spices also since I was so hungry to get some in before I got home but luckily they were not affected.\n\nTime for the sandwich review. The 1st half took about 2 minutes that was a few bites but it made me stop because there was heat and it was building. Let's say 6/10. Then to finish the rest of the sandwich was a decision you go all in or give up. I went all in and did finish the sandwich. That took about 4\\~5 more minutes because each bite was on the smaller side but did pour the their yummy sauce on it with each bite for flavor and praying it would lessin the heat but that was wrong. Now by then were at 10/10. Let's say worse I had was the 1 chip challenge and that was a 15/10 so it was not thatttt bad like overall mouth and throat scary heat. My mouth heat can tolerate alot but when it gets down my throat is where I say F this. It did get a small part of my upper throat but with just sipping on the slushy for 10 minutes straight after was the saving grace  or without it could of been a different story if all I had was just water. FYI it was the strawberry slushy.\n\n1. I am safe at habanero level but when I see the words Ghost and Reaper I get intrigued. I did try the one chip challenge(2021) like I said above so this Mainstream heat level I was not too worried about.\n2. would I do this again? No like the one chip challenge so I am on to less heat sandwiches there.\n3. If you do attempt it or each it regularly, I recommend getting a slushy or even 2 to be safe!\n4. Going to bed was semi-ok after it all calmed down but next take a did have some sharp stomach pains leading to bathroom run(1@8am and 1@1pm) so don't go too far from a toilet the next day to be safe.  cleaning it all out. Maybe TMI but it did not burn coming out lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9769fu9m7me1.jpg?width=2016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c041b211f621fdb7c24b7335f175c5e12d6823a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/on0jcou9m7me1.jpg?width=2016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14dd1ccaa31ed0b4fae8a384eaf7c1cbe9e36cad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uea9gdu9m7me1.jpg?width=2016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71dc4c03570ee474027e9209811de5bd404a326d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/1j1j3it/daves_hot_chicken_reaper_review12345/", "created_utc": 1740891412.0, "score": 0, "author": "Substantial-Tart-464", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1j1j3it/daves_hot_chicken_reaper_review12345/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Super Hot Sauces and Powders", "selftext": "I was reading some posts and, with a bit of nostalgia, remembering my first steps into the chilihead world. I built up my tolerance entirely by accident just by making angry pasta. I'd have to keep adding more cayenne powder (this was super hot for me back then) every week. Then I started using fresh diced habanero peppers in the pasta. They too became to tame. The internet brought me into the realm of super hots and their products. I thought I had the heat beat at this point so I brought my first, unopened, bottle of super hot sauce (Primo Army) to a family breakfast. How hot could it possibly be? The grocery store sauces didn't phase me anymore, so I knew I easily could handle this stuff. After dousing my eggs and hashbrowns with a healthy dose, and after taking my first bite...INSTANT PANIC set in and, thankfully I was wearing a hat, because sweat started pooling at the top of my head. Lesson learned? No. Addiction started? Yes. I became determined to beat this heat too so I started mixing this new level of sauce with other ingredients. My favorite mixture was plain cream cheese, super hot sauce, and brown sugar on a toasted sesame bagel. (That's still a goto breakfast item of mine.) Eventually my tolerance built up to handle the super hots, and then some, without much effort. (I still get the sweats but the heat is manageable.)\n\nWhat's my point with this? None. Just my fond memories of my start into the chilihead world. Maybe one tip, it might not be smart to jump in the deep end before you know exactly how deep it is. If you want to start adding super hots, extracts, and cap crystals into your diet, go slowly. And definitely research what cap cramps are, preferably before you get your first set of severe ones.

Dry spices themselves I have no issue with. I'm Mexican and most chiles I'm good with too.

Is this simply the third law of demand in action and I have been eating \u201csubpar\u201d horseradish my entire life?

I\u2019ve previously reviewed the same brand\u2019s Amarilla habanero sauce and enjoyed it so I was looking forward to this red variety as I typically enjoy the flavor of red habaneros even more than the orange and yellow variety.\n\nOne of the things I really enjoy about Butterfly Bakery of Vermont is there continual release of special micro-batch hot sauces with innovative flavor combinations. The limited-time availability of these does result in me spending more money with them than I would otherwise, but while I never got into Pokemon I do have the \u201cgotta catch \u2019em all\u201d attitude when it comes to hot sauces. This one piqued my interest as I love rosemary and dark leafy greens and it features a pepper I hadn\u2019t tried yet.\n\nThe Hungarian Wax Pepper, the source of heat in this sauce, is a thick-skinned pepper from Hungary with a heat level approximately that of a jalapeno. A member of Capsicum Annuum like jalapenos it\u2019s flavor is said to be similar to that of a bell pepper but spicier and with some sweet and tangy flavor elements as well. In addition to those peppers the other ingredient of special note here is the kale. Having been born in and still having lots of family in the southeastern USA I grew up enjoying collard greens, turnip greens, mustard greens, and more. While kale has has somehow managed to brand itself as the Los Angeles health food smoothie version of that type of green while the others maintain their soul food roots they\u2019re all very similar vegetables with earthy, meaty, and bitter flavor elements. This sauce has a medium-thin consistency with some nice bits of pepper and vegetables inside and an aroma that has some earthiness as well as the fresh evergreen scent of the rosemary.\n\nWhen I open up a green hot sauce I desire a super fresh and bright green flavor. Butterfly Bakery of Vermont Wax Pepper Kale Rosemary Hot Sauce isn\u2019t that, but that\u2019s not a bad thing in this case. Pouring more olive green than viridian this is a very earthy take on a green sauce both in appearance and flavor. The Hungarian wax peppers don\u2019t seem to have a very pronounced flavor but they do bring some vegetal notes which blend well with the earthy bitter flavor of the kale. The mild garlic flavor of the garlic scapes adds to that savory flavor. The rosemary is the real magic ingredient in this mix. The woody notes anchor down with the earthy flavor of the kale while the evergreen forest and herbal flavors help elevate everything and add that fresh element the sauce needs. Add a nice strong vinegar tang and the result is a sauce that\u2019s darker on the flavor spectrum than other green sauces but with enough freshness and zing to keep it exciting.\n\nDespite some strong flavors in play in this sauce I found it to be pretty flexible in terms of pairing. I found this sauce especially great with chicken salad. One of my favorite light dinners lately has been an avocado stuffed with chicken salad (similar to the Peruvian Palta Rellena con Pollo) and Wax Pepper Kale Rosemary Hot Sauce provides great depth and contrast to the creamy chicken salad. This is also a great sauce for chicken. Chicken and rosemary are a classic combination and chicken and kale often share a plate so this isn\u2019t surprising. A pairing that did surprise me with how well it worked was this sauce with tomato soup, the earthy bitter notes working perfectly against the brighter acidic tomato flavor.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend Butterfly Bakery of Vermont Wax Pepper Kale Rosemary Hot Sauce. Not only is it unique in terms of a green sauce it\u2019s also delicious and, thankfully, still available for purchase on their site at the time of this posting.

{"title": "High Desert Sauce Co - Smoky Chiltepin - OBITUARY REVIEW", "selftext": "Here lies HDSC Smoky Chiltepin - \n\n7.7/10\n\nI first met this sauce at Hot Sauce Werks in St Louis, and this is the first sauce I've tried from this brand. I was excited to pick this up, because I don't often see Chiltepin used in a sauce, and I think it's a seriously underused pepper. I burned through this one in less than a week, pun fully intended. The colors on this label are my favorites- burnt orange to yellow- and also, I enjoy the simplistic aesthetic. Overall probably the most visually pleasing bottles I've laid eyes upon. Let's get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: Right at the start, I knew this sauce would be easy to gobble down. This one has a nice medley of ingredients that team up to make a really compelling dance behind the teeth. The acidity shines with this. The first ingredient is tomatoes, which made me cautious at first. I thought it might be watered down and nearly flavorless, but I'm glad I was wrong. This sauce is on the thicker and chunkier side, and I relate to that. I'm not ashamed to say that this is like a really good salsa. If you put this in a tub and slapped a salsa label on it, nobody would bat an eye. And I mean this completely as a compliment! I was able to pick out the ancho and chiltepin pepper flavors through this experience. As I said before, I sucked this sauce down really quickly, as it paired really well with the breakfast burritos I use as a constant for my reviews here, and it's also not very hot. Advertised as medium, but i'd say it's on the med-high end of mild. I've hyped this sauce up this whole time. It's good. If you like sauces that have a lot of flavors yet don't feel overcrowded, this one is for you. Slight sweetness from the carrots and onion, and seasonings that match perfectly with most tacos or mexican food in general. Sharp vegetable bite from the peppers and lime juice. I will say it didn't taste very smokey, although I can taste that paprika specifically. Rest in Peace, Spicy Prince\n\nFeel free to recommend other sauces by High Desert Sauce Co.

{"title": "Char Man Original - OBITUARY", "selftext": "Here lies Char Man Original -\n\n8.7/10\n\nI first met this sauce when I ordered it through the Heat hot sauce shop. This was essentially a part of my Christmas bonus for staying in the building for like 70 hours due to a storm. I knew it was love at first sight. This was near the top of my priority list to try, and when I got the opportunity, I reached out at grabbed it. I always appreciate the paper labels that some brands use. It has a nice a nice feel to it, and in the writing hobby, we would say it has a lot of tooth, which means its has a more rough texture. I really enjoy the appearance of the branding, and the tidbit of story on the label made me smile. Let's get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: The name of the brand is apparent when you try this sauce. You can tell these peppers were actually roasted, as there are bits of char throughout the sauce, and you can even see the flakes on the photo. It has a char taste, without any smoked flavor, so it's likely they used gas flame to achieve this. I'd LOVE to also see a \"smoked\" version of this sauce as well, and I'm not complaining at all, I actually liked this one the way it is. The site itself advertised this as a sauce leaning sweet, but I personally didn't get too much sweetness, although when I did some tastebud investigation, I could tell there was that sugar flavor hidden in there. That being said, I think it is really well balanced. It appears that this sauce has more ingredients than what I'd normally detect. The garlic was there, but the lemon juice didn't really make much of an appearance, but again, that may be because this sauce is so well balanced that the flavors are an amalgamation, and the product is greater than the sum of its parts. Usually when I see people talk about this sauce, it's always hyped up as a daily everything sauce, and I can see why. I would crawl from the ashes to get this sauce again, but for now - Rest in Peace, Spicy Prince\n\nUse the comments and feel free to recommend other sauce varieties by Char Man.

Let's get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: The ingredients on this one are pretty self-explanatory. I will start off by saying that this sauce has a pure sugar sweetness to it. I would've ranked this higher if it appealed to me a little more. The sweetness kinda threw me off, but it was still a great sauce overall! The habanero taste was the second thing that hit me. Usually hab sauce is pretty heat forward, but this one had more of a build up for me. With that said, just from my observation, this sauce is typically advertised as being pretty hot, but I would say this one lands just a smidgen hotter than smack in the middle for a hab sauce.

{"title": "The Spicy Shark - Habanero - OBITUARY", "selftext": "Here lies The Spicy Shark Habanero\n\n6.7/10\n\nI grabbed this sauce at a local jerky place. I love that shop, and while it doesn't have a huge selection, the ones they do have is great! Great white sharks and I have something in common, and that's the fact that we have a great sense of smell. Without fail, before I take a bite of any hot sauce, I'll give it a nice long sniff straight from the bottle. For me, this is a great way to analyze the prominence of ingredients even more than tasting it. Much like a shark, I am an apex predator, and my prey of choice is hot sauce. Lets get into the review!\n\nREVIEW: I did my tasting of this sauce a while ago, so it's not necessarily fresh in my mind, so I'm reading from my notes. Right from the jump, I remember this sauce not being as hot as I expected. That's not a bad thing, and I remember being happy with the taste itself. I love bell peppers in a sauce, as it creates a nice fruity vegetal quality that I would include if I ever made a sauce. This sauce has a genuinely good balance of sweet and heat. It has different layers of sweetness instead of a punch from just one ingredient. The carrots, banana, and lemon really curb the bite from the peppers. This sauce has a particular creamy quality, I suspect from the banana, pectin, and oil combination. I dare say it was almost like a smoothie! The vinegar levels in this sauce are pretty subdued, and the heat is on the lower side of medium. The fennel and ginger add another layer of engaging flavors that go well together. This sauce could be an \"everything\" sauce for most people, but I also think this sauce would really shine on specific food items as well. I put this on my rotation list, so when I end up buying this sauce again, I think I'll use it on some grilled lamb skewers.

Always happy to help support a good cause and because I do love garlic pepper sauces I decided to order a couple of bottles (as well as some CaJohn\u2019s sauces that were involved in the support campaign I believe).\n\nThis sauce has a thin smooth texture, similar to Louisiana style sauces such as Crystal or Frank\u2019s. The aroma is similar to Louisiana styles also but with a sharper hint from the habanero peppers. Speaking of those peppers, aged habaneros are the primary ingredient in this sauce, joined with carrots, onion, and garlic, all in their dehydrated form. Going with all dehydrated vegetables is an interesting choice as dried ones always have a different flavor than fresh, but the use of dried aromatics does allow the sauce to be more liquid by eliminating the vegetable pulp that fresh ingredients would bring. Perhaps for a sauce meant to be used to accompany barbecue the desire was to have something similar in texture to traditional sauces like Crystal, and they succeeded on that front.\n\nBiscuits, Brisket, and Beer Garlic Pepper Sauce reminds me of Louisiana or Cajun style hot sauces when it comes to the flavor as well. Texture has a big impact on flavor and with the smooth liquid nature of this sauce it has that same quick heat and salty vinegary tang that Louisiana style sauces have. The habaneros do give it some differences \u2013 there\u2019s more of a heat punch hear, and there are some fruity elements from the habaneros that you don\u2019t get from cayenne. The inclusion of the carrots, onions, and garlic do take it a bit away from a traditional Louisiana style sauce, but this doesn\u2019t taste like a Caribbean style pepper sauce despite those being common ingredients in those. I believe with all of the aromatics being dehydrated their flavor impact isn\u2019t nearly as large as it would have been were they fresh. The sauce is still very enjoyable, just with a fairly simple and straightforward flavor profile that\u2019s essentially a kicked-up Louisiana style sauce.\n\nBeing a straightforward habanero sauce I expected this to be flexible and it is. It\u2019s amazing as a wing sauce of course, taking the basic cayenne based wing sauce to the next level with habaneros, and the liquid smoothness is a good thing in that application. Since this is the house sauce for a barbecue restaurant I had to try it with barbecue as well. It\u2019s a great sauce for pulled pork, similar in that NC Style pepper vinegar sauces used in their pulled pork (and far superior to the sweet sticky thick sauces so many places unfortunately drown their pulled pork in). This was also great with some sliced brisket. The tangy brightness of this sauce is a great counterpoint to fatty and smoky meats.\n\nI can recommend Biscuits, Brisket, and Beer Garlic Pepper Sauce. I have a suspicion that this is just a white label sauce by Hot Shots Distributing / United Sauces but it\u2019s still a quality sauce and a nice change of pace from the chunkier thicker sauces I\u2019ve been enjoying lately. and always good to have something around with a more simple flavor profile that\u2019s easy to pair with many dishes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4fhua", "created_utc": 1745247227.0, "score": 9, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1k4fhua/biscuits_brisket_and_beer_garlic_pepper_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

While I have too many sauces already I couldn\u2019t help picking some more up, especially since I found a lot of local Florida brands I wasn\u2019t familiar with (plus some others from around the Southeast).  \n\nI tried a ton of samples and some that really struck me are:\n\nThe Mirchi sauces from My Spice Buds. They taste sort of like what Indian pickles would be as hot sauces.  Very unique and flavorful.  \n\nDivine Pepper had two sauces with peppers I haven\u2019t had sauces made with before - one with Malagueta peppers and one with Wiri Wiri peppers.  Again unique and tasty.  \n\nPowerful Pepper Company\u2019s Chipotle Black Garlic Ghost is an umami bomb in a bottle and their This One XII is made from a combo of hot and super hot chiles from their own garden.  Fresh and pepper-forward.  They also have a great fresh tasting salsa with some good heat. \n\nI\u2019ve never been a big fan of Sriracha as a style, but the Sriracha from More-Ish Sauce Co really impressed me with flavor and by being barely sweet at all.  \n\nThe Here Fishy Fishy and Sinister Jack are both from Love Sauce, and they really need to work on their branding because you\u2019d have no idea looking at the bottles.   Here Fishy Fishy is very mustard forward while Sinister Jack has a sweet hot ghost pepper thing going on with pumpkin and fall spices.  \n\nThe Garlic Goodness and Hot Cubed are both from Saucey Queen and again they need to do a much better job letting people know that on the front of the bottle.  Garlic Goodness is one of the most garlicky sauces I\u2019ve tried.  \n\nThe dude from So-Yum who makes the Green Papaya sauce was a class act.  I accidentally dropped my bottle and it shattered, and when I went back to buy a replacement he wouldn\u2019t take my money and just gave me one.  \n\nTennessee Bob\u2019s makes a ton of sauces that are inspired by people in his life and who he\u2019s met selling sauces on the road.  The G Sauce is designed a pizza sauce and has a ton of oregano in it, really interesting flavor.  \n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any questions anyone has about the event.

For anyone who is looking for a hotter version, look no further. It's hotter and has a better taste in my humble opinion. This sauce can go on just about anything you'd want it to. It's fairly basic, so this review cant go too deep. It's thin, and has no real sweetness at all. It SAYS it has other ingredients in there, but I had a hard time detecting anything more than vinegar, peppers, and salt. The other flavors probably just round it out more. I was trying hard to taste the carrot, because I love that in a sauce. This sauce is pretty baller for being so simple and cheap. New standard for me!

{"title": "Boar's Head Jalapeno - OBITUARY", "selftext": "Here lies Boar's Head Jalapeno -\n\n5.3/10\n\nI was stoked to learn Boar's Head had a hot sauce. Their deli meats have always been a staple, and their quality has always been the standard. I locked eyes with this sauce in a small sandwich shop. My coworkers were gushing about the place all day, milking how much they loved the place. The sandwiches were admittedly pretty mid, but, I had one good takeaway, and that is this sauce. Lets get into the review\n\nREVIEW: While I gave this an average score, I enjoyed this sauce for what it was. Immediate brand appeal is what hooked me. This sauce truly showcases what a person means when they say a pepper is \"fruity\". Not exactly sweet, but it has a certain vegetal quality that is hard to describe. The heat level on this sauce is on the lower end of mild. The vinegar isn't in your face, and as my review-rival Magnus pointed out, the \"spices\" are mysterious and hard to determine exactly what they are, although I believe the blend is mostly paprika with a little onion powder, which leans into that vegetal aspect. You'll see there aren't many ingredients in this one. The consistency of the sauce is creamy, but by viscous nature, not taste. The sauce seems a little salty, but I suspect it appears that way because there aren't any competing flavors. I do believe this sauce would be good as a base for mixing. Whether it's another hot sauce, a tomato sauce for pastas, or even to jazz up some mayo for a nice boar's head sandwich. While I was eating this sauce, I thought it would go well with some strong mustard or their horseradish. That would really wake this sauce up.

Due to concern they could carry a disease detrimental to US citrus their import was banned between 1968 and 2005. My interest in more exotic foods grew during that time period from the late \u201990s to early \u201900s and I longed to taste these magical little morsels that were the key to the Ma (numbing) in traditional Sichuan (though at the time predominantly westernized as Szechuan) Ma La (or numbing and spicy) cuisine.\n\nWhen the import ban lifted my hopes of a surge of authentic Sichuan restaurants flooding the market to rescue us from General Tso\u2019s Chicken and the like were short lived. Turns out Americans by and large like way-too-sweet Americanized Chinese food and don\u2019t want to expand their culinary frontiers to new and interesting sensations. 50Hertz hopes to change that. Started by a Chinese American originally from Chongqing, known for its Sichuan cuisine, and named for the frequency that the Sichuan peppercorns are said to create numbing, their goal is to share the wonderful flavor and sensation of Sichuan peppercorns with the world.\n\nThe 50Hertz Tingly Peanuts make use of both green and red Sichuan peppercorns. The red are the more common variety with an earthier flavor with citrus overtones while the green have a stronger more floral and citrusy aroma and a stronger numbing sensation. In addition these contain some chili peppers for heat and MSG to increase the umami flavor and interestingly rosemary oil, though I don\u2019t get any strong rosemary flavors.\n\nThe peanuts themselves are plump with good texture and crunch. The tin contains quite a few Sichuan peppercorns which add more crunch and a little bit of chew. The Sichuan peppercorns are simultaneously earthy, citrusy, mineral, savory, umami, and pungent. The numbing tingly effect is pronounced and interesting in that it also seems to change the flavor of other foods and beverages enjoyed within a certain time period. Taking a drink of water after eating some of the tingly peanuts gives the water a mineral citrusy and slightly metallic flavor for instance. The amount and type of chili peppers used doesn\u2019t bring them to the front of the flavor spectrum. There\u2019s a very mild heat and some tiny chili flavor in the background but these are much more Ma than La. I\u2019d love to see the company release a version of these with some real heat \u2013 perhaps some dried Chinese Heaven Facing peppers which are often used in Sichuan cuisine, or even ghost peppers to really give them a kick. There is a nice umami flavor as well as the bright citrus and numbing notes, these are packed with flavors and will likely be unlike any other peanuts you\u2019ve tried.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend 50Hertz Tingly Foods Tingly Peanuts. They use high quality peanuts, a large number of high quality Sichuan peppercorns, and provide a taste and physical sensation that\u2019s unique to that product.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jugjkh", "created_utc": 1744126591.0, "score": 32, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1jugjkh/50hertz_tingly_foods_tingly_peanuts_review/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Strong Carolina reaper shot", "selftext": "I was at a party yesterday pretty drunk, where some guy came up to me with a glass bottle filled up with maybe 1.5 inches of  this dark coloured liquid. He claimed it was his own homemade vodka mixed with 4 large Carolina reapers and extremely strong and potent. Me being drunk I did not refuse to take a shot of this, so the guy poured 3 shot glasses for me him and his friend to have. \nA little side note I'm not used to spicy food, maybe some sirachia sauce on my noodles rarely. So I did not realise what I just got myself into. \nI was rethikining taking it but then the guy told me that a girl I knew in that party had a double shot earlier, in my head I could not back down at this point.\nI neck the shot, and didn't feel anything for a second just the liquid going back down into my stomach, I forgot to eat anything since breakfast at like 13:00 so I felt it hit my stomach with a bang before I felt the flames of the pepper start to creep up my throat and set my mouth alight. I felt like my innards became the pits of hell. I tried to play it off by pouring another shot for my friend and as a little prank used my cup that had 2 drops left in there. With my body going into shutdown mode I got this drink to my friend and told him to drink it, I then managed to get to the toilet with two ice cubes in my hand and a cup of juice. That toilet became the closest thing I can describe to torture, my stomach cramping my mouth and throat burning and me just wishing for the end of this nightmare. I resulted to calling my other friends who werent at the party and as soon as they heard what I did they started bursting out laughing, completely ignoring my pleads for help and advice. I then slammed down on the end call button and heard my other friend who I gave the drink to shouting to me through the door \"WHAT DID YOU GIVE ME, IT BURNS SO MUCH. ACTUALLY WHAT IS THIS.\" I open the door to let him in ordering him to help me throw up whatever I just consumed out of my system. \nI then leave the toilet after about 15 minutes of rethinking some of the choices I have made in my life and throwing up this concoction that I want to call the devils piss. I searched for the two other guys who took the shot with me, they had apparently found some milk right after they took it givinf them what I think would've been a more pleasant experience.\nI learnt a lot from this, the main thing being to not take homemade mixtures off sketchy looking people at social gatherings.

{"title": "Various spicy foods, grouped by heat level", "selftext": "We all have different levels of heat tolerance, and something I love about this sub and other similar ones is that I can find so many new spicy things to try. The downside is that it can be hard to gauge how hot something is relative to my own spice tolerance, as what someone might consider seriously hot I might consider fairly mild, and yet someone else might consider something kind of hot while it would have me on my knees. Here, I've put together a list roughly grouping popular items I see on Reddit + commonly eaten restaurant items by what I'd consider to be similar levels of heat based on my own experience consuming them. The title of each tier is my own personal opinion on how hot that level of heat is, so take that as you will. Hopefully this can provide a better frame of reference as to how hot something is in comparison to something else (I.e, \"I've had one thing in this tier, so the other things in this tier are probably a similar experience\"). Of course, this is just my own personal take on each of these items and others may debate the placement of some, but hopefully it's accurate enough. Additionally,  I added asterisks to the ones I eat on a frequent basis and can speak about the most confidently. \n\n##Legitimately Mild - Smallest Hint of Heat\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Banana Pepper\n- Jalape\u00f1o (mild)*\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Trader Joe\u2019s Ghost Pepper Chips\n- Spicy Campbell\u2019s Chunky Soups\n- Chick-fil-A Spicy Chicken Sandwich/Biscuit*\n- Store-bought Red Pepper Flakes*\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings - Cajun*\n- Wingstop - Cajun*\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Yellow or Black Label Valentina\n- Cholula\n- Texas Pete\n- Tabasco\n- Louisiana Hot Sauce\n- Sriracha*\n\n##Slight Heat - Very Easy to Eat\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Jalape\u00f1o (hot)*\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Flamin\u2019 Hot anything*\n- Takis*\n- Tin Drum Pad Thai Spice Level 3*\n- Campbell\u2019s Ghost Pepper Chicken Noodle Soup\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Zaxby\u2019s - Tongue Torch*\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Melinda\u2019s Ghost Pepper Wing Sauce\n- Melinda\u2019s Fire Roasted Garlic & Habanero*\n- Melinda\u2019s Habanero\n- Marie Sharpe\u2019s Habanero*\n- Secret Aardvark \n- Tabasco Habanero\n- Yellowbird Habanero\n- Trader Joe\u2019s Peri Peri\n\n##Decent Heat - Mild Enough to Eat a Lot of Without Any Struggle, But Hot Enough to Feel Satisfied\n**Food/Snacks**\n- XXTRA Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos*\n- Tin Drum Tikka Masala Spice Level 3*\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings Thai Curry*\n- Zaxby\u2019s Nuclear*\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Trader Joe\u2019s Habanero*\n- Melinda\u2019s Ghost Pepper*\n\n##Solid Heat - Not Bad in Moderate Doses but A Lot Can Be Tougher\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Thai Chili*\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Buldak 2x Ramen\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings Wild*\n- Wingstop Atomic*\n- Hattie B\u2019s Damn Hot\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Tabasco Scorpion*\n\n##Gonna Need A Good Tolerance to Enjoy Properly\n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Habanero*\n\n**Wing Sauces**\n- Buffalo Wild Wings Blazin\u2019 Knockout*\n- Hattie B\u2019s Shut the Cluck Up\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Torchbearer Garlic Reaper*\n- Torchbearer Zombie Apocalypse\n- Da Bomb\n\n##Only Eat For Challenge Purposes \n**Fresh Peppers**\n- Carolina Reaper\n- Ghost Pepper\n\n**Food/Snacks**\n- Death Nut\n\n**Hot Sauces**\n- Elijah\u2019s Xtreme Regret Reserve\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/1jizngr/various_spicy_foods_grouped_by_heat_level/", "created_utc": 1742844963.0, "score": 9, "author": "Shrekscoper", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1jizngr/various_spicy_foods_grouped_by_heat_level/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

He was one of the first to popularize cajun and creole cooking in the United States outside of Louisiana\u2019s area of influence and a mentor to Emeril Lagasse who would eventually carry on that role. His signature blackened redfish dish became so popular with so many imitators that strict limitations had to be set on commercial fishing of the species lest it go extinct. While he produced a range of dry seasonings that were (and in some places still are) common sights on grocery store shelves I wasn\u2019t aware that there was also a hot sauce until a recent Reddit post made me aware of it. I decided it was something I had to try.\n\nBased on the bottle shape, color, and the Paul Prudhomme\u2019s cuisine I was expecting this to be a Louisiana style sauce and that\u2019s more or less what it is. There are some notable variations in this compared to Crystal or Lousiana however. First the pepper blend includes both habaneros and cayenne, with habaneros being rare to see in Louisiana style sauces (though they do appear in the Poirier\u2019s Louisiana Style as well). Second is the inclusion of onion and garlic powders, nice seasonings for any sauce to be sure, but most Louisiana style sauces are just peppers, vinegar, and salt. Third, there\u2019s the cane syrup, which isn\u2019t something I can recall every seeing in that style of sauce. The color and texture are very much reminiscent of Louisiana style sauces however, as is the aroma, though that little bit of garlic and onion do poke through.\n\nThe habaneros have a great impact on the flavor of Chef Paul Prudhomme Magic Pepper Sauce. They bring their quick bite of heat and vegetal fruity nature to the front of the sauce\u2019s flavor profile while the vinegar tang and cayenne peppers solidify the roots of the sauce as that Louisiana style. The sweetness from the cane syrup is surprisingly a welcome addition to the sauce. I\u2019m not normally a fan of sweetness in savory sauces but it\u2019s subtle enough that it rounds out the flavor profile with also softening the vinegar tang a bit to make it less aggressive. The onion and garlic elements aren\u2019t at the forefront but they do add a nice savory backdrop to the sauce and make it taste richer and more full. The heat level is as expected for a Louisiana style sauce pretty minimal.\n\nThe beauty of this type of sauce is that they\u2019re extremely flexible. I enjoyed this on pizza, eggs, a ham and cheese sandwich, and even just a toasted bagel with some butter. One of the surprising places I found it worked very well was to add just the right amount of kick and extra acidity to some Chinese takeout wonton soup that I felt was just a little on the bland side before. There are unfortunately no cajun or creole restaurants in my area any longer since the only one we had shut down, but this has prompted me to consider making my own jambalaya.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend Chef Paul Prudhomme Magic Pepper Sauce. It\u2019s a tasty take on the Louisiana style sauce with some liberties taking to give it a unique flavor while still staying true to the style overall. This sauce is also all natural with no artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, or thickeners.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jitaem", "created_utc": 1742829844.0, "score": 25, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1jitaem/chef_paul_prudhomme_magic_pepper_sauce_review/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Recipe for homemade American Cheese infused with superhot Dragon's Breath chiles", "selftext": "So the other day on a whim I decided to try making some chile pepper infused American Cheese. It's not always my go-to cheese but there's something to be said for that ooey gooy consistency. In the end it was probably more effort than I'd exert on a regular basis, but it was a fun science experiment that resulted in one of the tastiest (and most face-melting-iest) grilled cheese sandwiches I've had in awhile.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k431mgc72wpe1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd74dec4aa982f28974a37f9d6b78e1d9c78551e\n\nAmerican cheese uses sodium citrate to emulsify the base cheese (often cheddar or colby) with a liquid, allowing it to melt much quicker. I didn't want to buy sodium citrate for this one experiment, so I searched reddit and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/2pxh99/how_to_make_sodium_citrate_from_baking_soda_and/) on making sodium citrate with baking soda and citric acid (which I happen to have industrial quantities of). Combining that information with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/7gxetm/comment/dqmkx5p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about ratios of cheese to liquid for various consistencies (ranging from cheese sauce to sliceable cheese), I was able to come up with this recipe:\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 oz shredded sharp cheddar (you can get creative with cheese combos here)\n* 2 tbsp half and half (you could use water, milk, etc)\n* 2.5 g baking soda\n* 2.1 g citric acid (you could try using lemon juice or vinegar here, though I'm not sure about optimal ratios)\n* 3 g Dragon's Breath chile flakes (this results in serious heat, so you can use less or use a milder chile flake depending on your tolerance)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. First, add the liquid to a pan. Then measure the baking soda and citric acid and let them react. It'll foam up for a bit and then settle. You have now have sodium citrate in a liquid. Doesn't look appetizing, but I didn't detect any baking soda flavor in the final product.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yeaw6gp0wpe1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=00bfb3f90ff16342892332377e0e571d79a0e002\n\n2. Start heating the liquid and add the chiles to infuse the flavor. A little goes a long way with superhots.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbm83p2z0wpe1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=972326a8925d74717c03a93b86437d27f0ed9fbc\n\n3. Then add the cheese and stir vigorously to combine. Keep the heat on low and be careful not to let it burn. It'll start out barely combined and then will melt into a thick sauce.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy4h4zvs4wpe1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb1d57ffc9dbe70a3077e9e42d9b964474e84672\n\n4.

{"title": "Cap Cramps - A Guide for Beginners", "selftext": "In the last few days, I've noticed several posts from people that are experiencing capsaicin cramps for the first time. \n\nFirst things first, if you have recently eaten something spicier than normal, or in a larger quantity than normal, and your gut is starting to feel a little worse for the wear, don't worry. You're completely fine. But, you could be in for a pretty bad and painful experience. The following is from google.\n\n\"Capsaicin cramps, resulting from consuming too much spicy food, can manifest as burning sensations, internal irritation, abdominal pain, and potentially nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. \n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown: \n\nGastrointestinal Symptoms:\nAbdominal pain and cramps: Capsaicin can stimulate pain receptors in the gut, leading to discomfort and cramping.\n\nNausea and vomiting: In some cases, excessive capsaicin intake can trigger nausea and even vomiting.\n\nDiarrhea: The burning sensation and irritation in the gut can lead to increased bowel movements and diarrhea.\n\nBurning sensation: Capsaicin directly interacts with pain receptors, causing a burning sensation in the mouth, throat, and potentially the stomach.\n\nOther Potential Symptoms:\n\nChest pain: In some cases, a burning sensation in the chest can occur due to capsaicin binding with pain receptors in the esophagus.\n\nSwelling of the throat: Swelling of the throat, making breathing difficult and/or causing hoarseness of voice.\n\nSeverity:\nThe intensity of these symptoms can vary depending on the amount of capsaicin consumed and individual sensitivity.\"\n\nThis is fairly accurate but doesn't do justice to just how painful these can be. Depending on the amount of capsaicin consumed, your experience could be as mild as a little belly ache, all the way up to having it feel like knives are carving up your insides. This feeling will pass, even if it takes hours. You do not need medical attention, and there's nothing a doctor can do for you.\n\nThe only way to truly get rid of cap cramps is to get it out of your system.  This means making yourself sick until you vomit it up and out of your system. After a chili pod eating competition, contestants will try to make themselves sick to prevent cap cramps from starting. But, if they've already started, it's not too late to purge. Some people think pickle juice helps to lessen their severity, or dairy like yogurt or ice cream. This can help, but purging is the best. \n\nYou also can help yourself by prepping a bit before indulging in spice. Some people say greasy food before helps, or taking a tablespoon or two of olive oil. I like to eat something that's a little greasy and high in carbs (well chewed pizza) before eating a stupid amount of capsaicin. The important thing is to make sure whatever you prep with is easy for you to purge out later.\n\nAlso, people can experience cap cramps differently. I always get them within two hours of eating stupid amounts of capsaicin but some of my friends won't get them until the following day even though a similar level of capsaicin was eaten. I get waves of cap cramps, intense pain that goes away for a bit then comes back just as you thought you were all better. The most I've had, or at least the most I remember counting was eight waves.

{"title": "Seed Ranch Truffle Hound review", "selftext": "Bitter: \u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nSalty: \u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nSour: \u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nSweet: \u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nUmami: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nHeat: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\n\nQuick Flavor Notes: Earthy, garlicky, umami, rich, smoky\n\nTexture: Medium with a smooth texture\n\nIngredients: Crushed Tomato, Water, White Vinegar, Truffle Pepper Blend (ghost pepper, chile de arbol, summer truffles (tuber aestivum), salt, vegetable fiber, organic and natural truffle flavor), Dates, Carrots, Garlic, Rice Vinegar, Olive Oil, Chickpea Miso (rice koji, chickpeas, sea salt, water, koji spores, seaweed), Sea Salt, Nutritional Yeast, Smoked Paprika, Konjac\n\nRecommended: Yes\n\nSeed Ranch out of Boulder, CO brands themselves as a \u201cFlavor Company\u201d rather thana hot sauce company. That flavor-first philosophy has been evident in all of the sauces from Seed Ranch that I\u2019ve tried thus far. While their sauces may not bringing scorching heat I\u2019ve always found them to have innovating and delicious flavor combinations. Because of the great track record I\u2019ve had with their products I decided to take a risk on them with a style of hot sauce that\u2019s perhaps the most difficult to actually do well \u2013 a truffle hot sauce.\n\nSeed Ranch Truffle Hound does use real black truffles in the sauce along with a bevy of other umami-rich ingredients including chickpea miso, nutritional yeast, and seaweed. The sauce has a tomato base and uses a combination of ghost peppers and chiles de arbol for the heat. The sauce is medium in consistency and smooth in texture with olive oil adding a particular creaminess and silkiness. Also interesting is the use of Konjac, a Japanese yam with a unique texture, as an all natural thickener. The aroma is earthy with small hints of sweetness and heat. I have to also give credit to Seed Ranch for their striking logo design for this product.\n\nThe flavor of Seed Ranch Truffle Hound is earthy, complex, intensely umami, savory, and just a little bit sweet. The earthy forest floor flavor of the black truffles comes forward immediately, accented by the smokiness of the ghost peppers and chiles de arbol. The tomatoes and rice wine vinegar bring some tanginess and acidity without making this an acid-forward sauce. The miso emphasizes that deep umami flavor of the truffles and adds a foundation to the sauce as well as a little bit of sweetness along with the dates and carrots. The garlic flavor comes through after the first wave leaving the sauce with a savory finish. This is one of the most complex hot sauces I\u2019ve ever tasted, with a long finish as the tastes change as new elements crest over the palate. Despite having ghost peppers the heat level of this sauce is on the milder side of medium.\n\nWith the earthy umami-bomb flavors in this sauce I felt that grilled meats would be a perfect first pairing. Truffle Hound is a great accompaniment for grilled steaks and pork chops. Adding a solid dollop into a bowl of chili gave it a deeper more developed flavor. I found it was also great with some Tallarin Saltado (think a Latin take on Lo Mein) though I found in that case adding a bit of Marie Sharp\u2019s Belizean Heat as well to add some brightness had the best effect. While Seed Ranch Truffle Hound has a powerful taste it also blends well with foods that go well with mushrooms as well as foods that have some of those earthy umami flavor elements already.\n\nI\u2019m happy to recommend Seed Ranch Truffle Hound. It\u2019s by far the tastiest truffle hot sauce that I\u2019ve tried thus far and with the unique spin of adding miso as well it becomes an umami tour-de-force. Truffle Hound is all natural with no artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, or thickeners.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j89uqh", "created_utc": 1741641811.0, "score": 22, "author": "MagnusAlbusPater", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/spicy/comments/1j89uqh/seed_ranch_truffle_hound_review/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Dave's hot chicken Reaper Review#12345", "selftext": "I never had Dave's Hot chicken before since it opened near me \\~2 months ago. Had a long week at work and it was 9pm so why not try it for the 1st time and start from the top. Got the Reaper combo with a side of their sauce and 1 frozen slushy(best decision)They print out two(2) copies of this wavier and make you sign and date both but you need to a minimum do it to one they keep. After waited 5 minutes for the to-go box. Only thing that worried me was since the to-go box held the sandwich and the fries, the fries would get the reaper spices also since I was so hungry to get some in before I got home but luckily they were not affected.\n\nTime for the sandwich review. The 1st half took about 2 minutes that was a few bites but it made me stop because there was heat and it was building. Let's say 6/10. Then to finish the rest of the sandwich was a decision you go all in or give up. I went all in and did finish the sandwich. That took about 4\\~5 more minutes because each bite was on the smaller side but did pour the their yummy sauce on it with each bite for flavor and praying it would lessin the heat but that was wrong. Now by then were at 10/10. Let's say worse I had was the 1 chip challenge and that was a 15/10 so it was not thatttt bad like overall mouth and throat scary heat. My mouth heat can tolerate alot but when it gets down my throat is where I say F this. It did get a small part of my upper throat but with just sipping on the slushy for 10 minutes straight after was the saving grace  or without it could of been a different story if all I had was just water. FYI it was the strawberry slushy.\n\n1. I am safe at habanero level but when I see the words Ghost and Reaper I get intrigued. I did try the one chip challenge(2021) like I said above so this Mainstream heat level I was not too worried about.\n2. would I do this again? No like the one chip challenge so I am on to less heat sandwiches there.\n3. If you do attempt it or each it regularly, I recommend getting a slushy or even 2 to be safe!\n4. Going to bed was semi-ok after it all calmed down but next take a did have some sharp stomach pains leading to bathroom run(1@8am and 1@1pm) so don't go too far from a toilet the next day to be safe.  cleaning it all out.

The grocery store sauces didn't phase me anymore, so I knew I easily could handle this stuff. After dousing my eggs and hashbrowns with a healthy dose, and after taking my first bite...INSTANT PANIC set in and, thankfully I was wearing a hat, because sweat started pooling at the top of my head. Lesson learned? No. Addiction started? Yes. I became determined to beat this heat too so I started mixing this new level of sauce with other ingredients. My favorite mixture was plain cream cheese, super hot sauce, and brown sugar on a toasted sesame bagel. (That's still a goto breakfast item of mine.) Eventually my tolerance built up to handle the super hots, and then some, without much effort. (I still get the sweats but the heat is manageable.)\n\nWhat's my point with this? None. Just my fond memories of my start into the chilihead world. Maybe one tip, it might not be smart to jump in the deep end before you know exactly how deep it is. If you want to start adding super hots, extracts, and cap crystals into your diet, go slowly. And definitely research what cap cramps are, preferably before you get your first set of severe ones.

I do get the classic runny nose, but no sweat, only shakes/shivering.\n\n  \nWhat I have found is that this could be the way my body just ends up regulating itself naturally, but I'm usually very sensitive to change in temperatures, and can easily sweat even when coming from a cold environment to a warm environment (it's currently winter, so going from outside with no jacket to inside with a warm, stuffy environment makes me sweat like crazy. I can't wear a jacket or sweater when I'm outside cause I'll start to overheat as well).\n\n  \nI also only have this issue with certain spicy food as well. Dry spices themselves I have no issue with. I'm Mexican and most chiles I'm good with too. Panda Express' kung pao chicken I used to enjoy but can't anymore, and it's only their kung pao chicken and not other restaurants. Same issue with Wingstop's mango habanero compared to other places' mango habanero. Hot sauces are hit or miss.
