Just 2 steps)", "selftext": "Hey r/instapot, I'm really excited to share my first post with you here! \n\nCan you make instant ramen like Top Ramen, Maruchan, Nissin in an Instant Pot? Yes! \n\nWHY would you want to cook instant ramen in your electric pressure cooker? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nBecause unlike stovetop or microwaves, you can use \"zero minute cooking\" with your Instant Pot! I'll also show you how to add a runny egg on top \ud83d\ude09\n\n#\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73WRITTEN DIRECTIONS\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n\nIngredients: \n\n- 1 or more blocks of ramen\n\n- 1.5-2 cups of water (or more if using 2+ blocks of ramen)\n\nHere are some optional ingredients that you can leave out if you don\u2019t have them, or add if you want to kick this recipe up a notch: \n\n- 1+ eggs\n\n- 1+ servings frozen vegetables like spinach, corn, or whatever you like to put in your ramen\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 1: Add your ramen block to the IP, water, and seasoning packet. If you're using any frozen vegetables, add them here too. \n\nMANUAL PRESSURE (high if you have option) = 0 MINUTES \n\nQuick release.\n\nNot adding an egg? DONE! \n\nWant to add an egg?\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 2: Prior to QR (because you want residual heat in your IP), crack your raw eggs into a bowl. \n\nWhen ready to add eggs, open your IP after a Quick Release, gently pour raw eggs on top of noodles, close IP lid. I like to put the valve back on \"sealing\" to keep as much heat in as possible. \n\nSet a timer for 5-7m. \n\nOpen pot, check if eggs are fully cooked. \n\nDONE! \n\n(If your eggs aren't cooked yet just close the lid back up, and wait another 1-2m.

This morning I made steel cut oats and had washed the pot, but not put back into the instant pot. Like an idiot, I dumped a pound of garbanzo beans into the instant pot without the pot in it. I turned it over and the liquid in the little cup spilled all over. It smelled awful. That was just the start. A bunch of the beans got into the bottom of the pot! \n\nIt took me a while to figure out I was not going to shake them all out of the casing, so I turned it over and found that there is a screw with an Allen wrench socket holding the bottom on. Yay! I had a wrench that fit and removed the bottom and after some messing around shook all the beans out. We also took the opportunity to clean the bottom and outside of the casing very well, being careful not to get any liquid into the electronics into the casing. \n\nSo, lesson learned. Keep the steam gathering cup (not sure of the real name) clean. Never dump anything into the instant pot without the pot. If you do, there is a solution.

Tetris challenges. Hanging out. It's time to start preparing the recipe. \n\nGod. This seems really complicated. Why so many steps?

Add the sour cream and cornstarch. \n\nHusband is taking the water out of the noodles and puts them next to the stew pot. The Boy is setting up the drinking  water and utensils for the 3 place settings without being asked. It's dished up in a few minutes. Dishes are tidy but left for clean up until after we eat. \n\nTurns out I did an okay job. Might be some of those ingredients and steps were important. But it doesn't taste bad and it's not inedible. So we eat a portion and tidy up the leftovers and remaining dishes.

{"title": "Leaky overflowing steam release? plz help!", "selftext": "EDIT:  I came back to say, this has been an important lesson in not taking the recipes that come with the app for granted. This was my first attempt at doing anything with an instapot, and I can honestly say I've learned a lot. \nIf I had checked the ratings and reviews provided in the recipe, I could have seen something was amiss by all the negative reviews warning of exactly what I experienced. \nAlas. Live and learn  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n....._______\n\n\n\nHello! I am having some trouble with my new instapot and I'm hoping for some advice.\n\nI just got an Instant Pot Pro Plus, and my first run with it has been a bit confusing and disappointing.\n\nI attempted to cook plain white rice (just \"Basmati Rice\" from the app, which is the same kind of rice I used, to be clear) in it using the app, which handles all the settings automatically. I'll admit the 1 cup of rice to 5.5 cups of water feels somehow strange, but that's what the instructions said and that's what I did.\n\nThe venting process to release the steam at the end leaked water all over the top of the device, and the countertop it's sitting on. The cup on the back to catch it was overflowing. Also, there's still a ton of water the rice never absorbed.\n\nI'm not sure where I went wrong, and trying to sift through Google results in an attempt to troubleshoot this mess is truly overwhelming.\n\nI can't determine if there's something wrong with the steam valve itself, if it's not set right, or something else I'm overlooking. I followed all the instructions for initial set up and I'm pretty sure I didn't miss anything, but I'll admit it's possible if this is the result I'm now dealing with.\n\nAnyone have any insights?

{"title": "Instant Pot Carrot Ginger Soup", "selftext": "**Ingredients:**\n\n* **3 pounds of carrots,** finely chopped using a mini chopper. Finely chopping helps break down the cell walls of the carrots, releasing their natural sugars and making them easier to cook down into a smooth texture.\n* **1 large onion,** chopped. Onions add depth of flavor and natural sweetness due to the Maillard reaction during saut\u00e9ing, where amino acids and sugars react to create complex flavors.\n* **3 cloves of garlic,** minced. Garlic adds a sharp, savory flavor that mellows as it cooks, enhancing the overall taste profile of the soup.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Ginger provides a warm, spicy note, and its main compound, gingerol, contributes to both the flavor and the health benefits of the soup.\n* **5 cups of vegetable broth.** The broth is the primary liquid, and it helps distribute the flavors evenly throughout the soup while also softening the vegetables.\n* **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Used for saut\u00e9ing, olive oil adds richness and helps in the heat transfer needed to cook the onions, garlic, and spices properly.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Cumin adds an earthy, warm flavor that complements the sweetness of the carrots and the spiciness of the ginger.\n* **Salt and pepper,** to taste. Salt enhances all the flavors in the soup by reducing bitterness and increasing the perception of sweetness.\n* **1 cup of coconut milk.** Coconut milk adds creaminess and a slight sweetness due to its fat content, which emulsifies when blended into the soup, giving it a smooth and luxurious texture.\n* **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Yogurt adds additional creaminess and a slight tang, thanks to its lactic acid content, which can brighten the flavors of the soup.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables:** Set your Instant Pot to the saut\u00e9 function and add **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Heat the oil, then add **1 chopped large onion** and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes. Saut\u00e9ing causes the onions to undergo the Maillard reaction, enhancing their natural sweetness and depth of flavor.\n2. **Add Aromatics:** Add **3 cloves of minced garlic** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Saut\u00e9 for another minute until fragrant. This step helps to release the volatile oils in the garlic and ginger, intensifying their flavors.\n3. **Cook the Carrots and Spices:** Stir in the **3 pounds of finely chopped carrots** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes to coat the carrots in the spices, which allows the flavors to meld. The heat also helps to soften the carrots slightly, making them easier to cook and blend later.\n4. **Add Broth and Pressure Cook:** Pour in **5 cups of vegetable broth** and season with **salt and pepper** to taste. Close and seal the Instant Pot, then set it to manual high pressure for 10-12 minutes. During pressure cooking, the high heat and pressure help break down the fibers in the carrots, allowing them to become very tender, which makes the soup easier to puree and provides a smooth consistency.\n5. **Release Pressure and Add Creamy Ingredients:** Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow for a natural pressure release for about 10 minutes, and then carefully quick-release any remaining pressure. Stir in **1 cup of coconut milk** and **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Adding these creamy components while the soup is still hot helps to evenly distribute their fat content, creating a rich, velvety texture without the need for heavy cream.\n6. **Final Seasoning and Serve:** Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper as needed. The combination of coconut milk and yogurt balances the sweetness of the carrots and the heat from the ginger, creating a well-rounded flavor profile.\n7. **Serve Hot:** Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs or a drizzle of coconut milk if desired. The final soup should be thick, creamy, and flavorful, with the natural sweetness of the carrots balanced by the warmth of the ginger and cumin, and the richness of the coconut milk and yogurt.\n\n\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "created_utc": 1738274289.0, "score": 8, "author": "Known_Milk_3953", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Questions from a newbie", "selftext": "I've had my IP since Christmas and I love it, but I do have a couple questions. \n\nI find cooking times wildly inconsistent with regard to the doneness of meat. I think I would do better if I understood the process more. \n\nI mostly cook chicken. Both thighs and breasts. Granted thighs are easier to cook and not come out dry, but there has to be a way to cook breasts so they are not so dried out. I generally brown them first and then cook. \n\nUsually when I check the temp on most recipes, the meat ends up being well over 200 degrees, when we only need 165. But maybe I don't understand the cooking process.\n\nWhat is the benefit of allowing the meat to continue cooking on self-release? Is the actual cooking being done mostly in the pressure stage? Is the temp of the meat irrelevant when it cooks longer in a pressure cooker? Would the meat be better closer to the 165 temp, as it would normally with stove cooking?\n\nAlso with browning, I have a LOT of trouble with the meat sticking. I believe this is due to the convex surface, the oil runs to the edges. The pot is plenty hot, but the meat does not self release well, so I end up browning it too long.

{"title": "How can I make this chili with rice recipe \"work\" in an insta pot?", "selftext": "So I am a bodybuilder and every meal I make needs to be aligned with specific macros. Chiefly with extra protein. Most recipes out there do not have enough protein but roughly are what I want to make.\n\nI am also lazy and I want to make absolutely as much as I can in the pot.\n\nSo I took my 8 QT insta pot and added the following:\n\n* 1 Tbsp avocado oil\n* 1/2 Tbsp worcestershire sauce\n* Onions/Green pepper/Carrots\n* 3 lb ground turkey browned\n* Some spices\n* 15 oz kidney beans\n* 15 oz chili beans\n* 28 oz crushed tomatos\n* 2 Tbsp tomato paste\n* 1/2 Tbsp lime juice\n* 1.5 cups brown rice\n* 2 cups water\n\nThis filled the pot to right about its fill limit. I get that its odd to add rice to this but I wanted to add some easy carbs into it.\n\nNow the mistake I made (being new to pressure cooking and never having hit the burn warning) was mixing this all up in the pot.\n\nWell of course the pot gave my a burn alert while heating up.\n\nI tried removing quite a bit of volume and adding 2 cups of water.\n\nStill couldn't get it without the burn alert.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess my question is.

I hear Air Fryers are good for making crispy chicken so that's something I might want but what would I miss out from not having the Ultra? I'm also reading mixed reviews on the Air Fryer part of the Duo not working that well. Would I be better buying a seperate Air Fryer? If I even decide I still want it after using pressure cooker/slow cooker options? and what about the Duo Nova/Duo Plus?\n\nLast when comparing Instapot to Crockpot, I noticed Crockpot has a clear lid. Is this a major downgrade since Instapot can do the same thing as a Crockpot and more? I'd think being able to see the progress of the cooked food would be nice without removing the lid but maybe it's not that important.\n\nThoughts?

I was under the impression that it should only be vented when the cooking cycle was complete.   Are there situations when using this that it should be venting the entire time, or is the point of a pressure cooker to ensure the pressure remains in the pot and once the cooking process is complete, then it will release the steam.

No issues, And I could eat. \n\nFast forward to today. I go to make coconut rice, I use the rice feature. It gets up to pressure, it seals. I do a slow release, and the rice is burnt on the bottom. \n\nAnyone have an idea about what\u2019s going on here? Or how to fix it? Anything at all would be helpful!\n\nOh!

The only problem is that I have to stay the entire afternoon at home, monitoring the pot.\n\nI have friends that said that with a pressure cooker things can be speeded up a lot.

{"title": "Overcooked Beef Again", "selftext": "I put my brisket to cook for 1.5 hours. I know what you're thinking \"OMG, what's wrong with you!\"\n\nThe thing is, I like cheap cuts, but I also like tender meat. No, not tender. Super tender. I mean nearly Texture-less Tender.\n\nIn vein, I try to achieve this by cooking beef longer... But you know what that means- DRY AND STRINGY. I like that the meat falls apart, but the individual muscle strands are incredibly stringy and still quite tough.\n\nDo I cook even longer?\n\nWhat kind of meat preparation should I do before hand? I brined over night heavy salt, should I brine longer? I want to bite into the meat and have the same fall apart texture, but without the dryness and tough strings. I want to be able to cut it against the grain with a fork!\n\nEDIT: \nI found my perfect solution. Stop pressure cooking, and start using the Sous Vide option on my Instant Pot!\n\n1. Salt rub some Brisket and let it sit in the fridge for 1 to 24hours.\n2. Put about 1/2 inch of oil/grease into the Instant Pot, set it to Saut\u00e9, and after it comes to temperature, then sear each side of the meat for about a minute or two.\n3. Place the meat on a plate, and drain all oil from the pot. (The meat will be extremely tough)\n4. Put meat back the pot (mine nearly filled the entire bottom of the pot).\n5. Pour in water so the meat is 2/3 covered. \n6. Put generous amounts of your favorite seasonings on the meat tops.\n7. Add about 1 tspb salt to the water.\n8. Set the Instant Pot to Sous Vide at about 158F (70C) for 3 days. Every 6 to 12 hours, check the meat with a fork or knife to achieve your desired tenderness. For me, about 2 days is the sweet spot.\n9. Optionally, place the meat on a pan, then into a convection oven, and heat the meat at the highest temperature until the meat/fat outside is crispy.\n\nWow, moist, flavorful, and extremely tender! No dryness. No stringy muscle fibers. Best Brisket I ever ate in my life. Technically this is slow cooking (crockpot), but at a lower temperature than standard crockpots operate. Low and slow is the way to go for Amazing food. Lower temperature prevents the fat from being rendered out of the meat, which preserves meat moisture and flavor.

{"title": "Cannot understand why Instapot is popular", "selftext": "I bought an Instapot to replace my no stick Westbendnslow cooker and my Hamilton Beach slow cooker sous vide unit.\nThe nonstick finish on both was showing knicks. I do love the stainless steel insert of the Instapot.\nI hate how the seal takes on strong odors from everything that cooks in it.  I\u2019ve tried all the cleaning hacks I can find but the only thing that works for me if to wash and air dry it then store it outside the Instapot. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why they added a slow cooker function when it takes 2-3 hours for the unit to preheat before switching to low slow cook.  I contacted the manufacturer and they said this was \u201cnormal\u201d and to add an extra 3 hours to the slow cook time.  THAT IS NIOT NORMAL!  Make it work right or don\u2019t include the feature.  For fear of poisoning us while it preheats for several hours I stopped using the Instapot for slowcooking and bought a slow cooker with a crock insert.\n\nThe sous vide works ok if you add really hot water (about 130 - 135 F) to the Instapot before hand.  It gets up to temperature fairly quickly. BUT the size of what you can sous vide is very limited by the shape of the vessel (think brisket).\n\nNow to the pressure cooker which is supposedly the forte of this thing. Previously I made a beef stew by other means.  I saved half of the browned beef, onion and garlic and other savouries, deglazed the pan and then froze it.  Today I placed the frozen beef and 2 cups of broth in the Instapot.  After 25 minutes on high and 10 minutes natural pressure release, then fast release I opened the lid and stirred to make sure the meat was separated.  I added carrots and potatoes cut in small pieces.  I set the pressure cooker for another 30 minutes.  First the pressure cooker had to preheat again. After the 30 minute cook time was up the message display said \u201cdo not open lid\u201d for over 30 minutes.  I got tired of waiting so I released the pressure so we could eat.  \nThe liquid had to be thickened.   I expected that.  Finally after almost 2 hours (using this wonderful time saving device) dinner was served.\nThe beef was tough. The potatoes were a little too done and the carrots were a little hard. The other half of the beef cooked by a different method was not tough.  \n\n\nHad I realized the issues with the Instapot I would not have bought it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1aucwv5/cannot_understand_why_instapot_is_popular/", "created_utc": 1708311833.0, "score": 0, "author": "slmcalg", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1aucwv5/cannot_understand_why_instapot_is_popular/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Instant Pot Carrot Ginger Soup", "selftext": "**Ingredients:**\n\n* **3 pounds of carrots,** finely chopped using a mini chopper. Finely chopping helps break down the cell walls of the carrots, releasing their natural sugars and making them easier to cook down into a smooth texture.\n* **1 large onion,** chopped. Onions add depth of flavor and natural sweetness due to the Maillard reaction during saut\u00e9ing, where amino acids and sugars react to create complex flavors.\n* **3 cloves of garlic,** minced. Garlic adds a sharp, savory flavor that mellows as it cooks, enhancing the overall taste profile of the soup.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Ginger provides a warm, spicy note, and its main compound, gingerol, contributes to both the flavor and the health benefits of the soup.\n* **5 cups of vegetable broth.** The broth is the primary liquid, and it helps distribute the flavors evenly throughout the soup while also softening the vegetables.\n* **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Used for saut\u00e9ing, olive oil adds richness and helps in the heat transfer needed to cook the onions, garlic, and spices properly.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Cumin adds an earthy, warm flavor that complements the sweetness of the carrots and the spiciness of the ginger.\n* **Salt and pepper,** to taste. Salt enhances all the flavors in the soup by reducing bitterness and increasing the perception of sweetness.\n* **1 cup of coconut milk.** Coconut milk adds creaminess and a slight sweetness due to its fat content, which emulsifies when blended into the soup, giving it a smooth and luxurious texture.\n* **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Yogurt adds additional creaminess and a slight tang, thanks to its lactic acid content, which can brighten the flavors of the soup.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables:** Set your Instant Pot to the saut\u00e9 function and add **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Heat the oil, then add **1 chopped large onion** and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes. Saut\u00e9ing causes the onions to undergo the Maillard reaction, enhancing their natural sweetness and depth of flavor.\n2. **Add Aromatics:** Add **3 cloves of minced garlic** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Saut\u00e9 for another minute until fragrant. This step helps to release the volatile oils in the garlic and ginger, intensifying their flavors.\n3. **Cook the Carrots and Spices:** Stir in the **3 pounds of finely chopped carrots** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes to coat the carrots in the spices, which allows the flavors to meld. The heat also helps to soften the carrots slightly, making them easier to cook and blend later.\n4. **Add Broth and Pressure Cook:** Pour in **5 cups of vegetable broth** and season with **salt and pepper** to taste. Close and seal the Instant Pot, then set it to manual high pressure for 10-12 minutes. During pressure cooking, the high heat and pressure help break down the fibers in the carrots, allowing them to become very tender, which makes the soup easier to puree and provides a smooth consistency.\n5. **Release Pressure and Add Creamy Ingredients:** Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow for a natural pressure release for about 10 minutes, and then carefully quick-release any remaining pressure. Stir in **1 cup of coconut milk** and **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Adding these creamy components while the soup is still hot helps to evenly distribute their fat content, creating a rich, velvety texture without the need for heavy cream.\n6. **Final Seasoning and Serve:** Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper as needed. The combination of coconut milk and yogurt balances the sweetness of the carrots and the heat from the ginger, creating a well-rounded flavor profile.\n7. **Serve Hot:** Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs or a drizzle of coconut milk if desired. The final soup should be thick, creamy, and flavorful, with the natural sweetness of the carrots balanced by the warmth of the ginger and cumin, and the richness of the coconut milk and yogurt.\n\n\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "created_utc": 1738274289.0, "score": 8, "author": "Known_Milk_3953", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I wanted to put the meal together before work so I opted to use an InstantPot on slow cook mode. I did everything exactly as I normally would have, braising the meat first and then adding the broth etc. etc. The recipe uses two cups of red wine. When I got home, I was so excited, and it was DISGUSTING. Everything tasted completely bitter and the broth distinctly tasted of alcohol. I drank the rest of the wine, so I know the wine wasn't bad too. I mean it was not GOOD wine by any means, but it wasn't off or anything. Also noteworthy, I tried to save the meat thinking I'd just eat it anyway (lol), and when I opened the container a few days later it was like getting punched with a bottle of vodka.  \nWTF happened??

I know what you're thinking \"OMG, what's wrong with you!\"\n\nThe thing is, I like cheap cuts, but I also like tender meat. No, not tender. Super tender. I mean nearly Texture-less Tender.\n\nIn vein, I try to achieve this by cooking beef longer... But you know what that means- DRY AND STRINGY. I like that the meat falls apart, but the individual muscle strands are incredibly stringy and still quite tough.\n\nDo I cook even longer?\n\nWhat kind of meat preparation should I do before hand? I brined over night heavy salt, should I brine longer? I want to bite into the meat and have the same fall apart texture, but without the dryness and tough strings. I want to be able to cut it against the grain with a fork!\n\nEDIT: \nI found my perfect solution. Stop pressure cooking, and start using the Sous Vide option on my Instant Pot!\n\n1. Salt rub some Brisket and let it sit in the fridge for 1 to 24hours.\n2. Put about 1/2 inch of oil/grease into the Instant Pot, set it to Saut\u00e9, and after it comes to temperature, then sear each side of the meat for about a minute or two.\n3. Place the meat on a plate, and drain all oil from the pot. (The meat will be extremely tough)\n4. Put meat back the pot (mine nearly filled the entire bottom of the pot).\n5. Pour in water so the meat is 2/3 covered. \n6. Put generous amounts of your favorite seasonings on the meat tops.\n7. Add about 1 tspb salt to the water.\n8. Set the Instant Pot to Sous Vide at about 158F (70C) for 3 days. Every 6 to 12 hours, check the meat with a fork or knife to achieve your desired tenderness. For me, about 2 days is the sweet spot.\n9. Optionally, place the meat on a pan, then into a convection oven, and heat the meat at the highest temperature until the meat/fat outside is crispy.\n\nWow, moist, flavorful, and extremely tender! No dryness. No stringy muscle fibers. Best Brisket I ever ate in my life. Technically this is slow cooking (crockpot), but at a lower temperature than standard crockpots operate. Low and slow is the way to go for Amazing food. Lower temperature prevents the fat from being rendered out of the meat, which preserves meat moisture and flavor.

{"title": "Cannot understand why Instapot is popular", "selftext": "I bought an Instapot to replace my no stick Westbendnslow cooker and my Hamilton Beach slow cooker sous vide unit.\nThe nonstick finish on both was showing knicks. I do love the stainless steel insert of the Instapot.\nI hate how the seal takes on strong odors from everything that cooks in it.  I\u2019ve tried all the cleaning hacks I can find but the only thing that works for me if to wash and air dry it then store it outside the Instapot. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why they added a slow cooker function when it takes 2-3 hours for the unit to preheat before switching to low slow cook.  I contacted the manufacturer and they said this was \u201cnormal\u201d and to add an extra 3 hours to the slow cook time.  THAT IS NIOT NORMAL!  Make it work right or don\u2019t include the feature.  For fear of poisoning us while it preheats for several hours I stopped using the Instapot for slowcooking and bought a slow cooker with a crock insert.\n\nThe sous vide works ok if you add really hot water (about 130 - 135 F) to the Instapot before hand.  It gets up to temperature fairly quickly. BUT the size of what you can sous vide is very limited by the shape of the vessel (think brisket).\n\nNow to the pressure cooker which is supposedly the forte of this thing. Previously I made a beef stew by other means.  I saved half of the browned beef, onion and garlic and other savouries, deglazed the pan and then froze it.  Today I placed the frozen beef and 2 cups of broth in the Instapot.  After 25 minutes on high and 10 minutes natural pressure release, then fast release I opened the lid and stirred to make sure the meat was separated.  I added carrots and potatoes cut in small pieces.  I set the pressure cooker for another 30 minutes.  First the pressure cooker had to preheat again. After the 30 minute cook time was up the message display said \u201cdo not open lid\u201d for over 30 minutes.  I got tired of waiting so I released the pressure so we could eat.  \nThe liquid had to be thickened.   I expected that.  Finally after almost 2 hours (using this wonderful time saving device) dinner was served.\nThe beef was tough. The potatoes were a little too done and the carrots were a little hard.

{"title": "Coconut Rice Help?", "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019ve been using my instapot for like 6 years to make rice using a method from the kitchn.com, kinda can\u2019t remember the website now actually, but I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s it. It\u2019s basically 2 cups liquid, 2 cups rice high pressure for 3 min, slow release for 10 min or just rapid release if I\u2019m impatient. \n\nSo started making coconut rice the same way, except 2 cans coconut milk to 2 cups rice high pressure 3 minutes. Did it like this FOR YEARS. Always turned out perfect, Tasted great, no issues at all. \n\nThen, a few months ago was making the coconut rice as usual, and my instapot was not getting up to pressure or sealing at all, and the rice/coconut kept burning and sticking to the bottom. Tried it like twice this way, same thing BOTH TIMES. So aggravating. So then on my 3rd try I used the rice feature which is low pressure for 12 minutes. AND IT WORKED! No issues, And I could eat. \n\nFast forward to today. I go to make coconut rice, I use the rice feature. It gets up to pressure, it seals. I do a slow release, and the rice is burnt on the bottom. \n\nAnyone have an idea about what\u2019s going on here? Or how to fix it? Anything at all would be helpful!\n\nOh!

I am hoping the 3 cups will take longer to heat up, so the eggs from going bang and also be the right time to cook them. \n\nIf that works I could try 4 cups and only 2 or 3 mins cook time. \n\nHad anyone perfected their instapot eggs without any popping?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/12arqae/eggs_is_this_the_way/", "created_utc": 1680543686.0, "score": 13, "author": "wryruss", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/12arqae/eggs_is_this_the_way/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It\u2019s up to you how you like to prepare your meat, but my rule of thumb is at least 10 grinds of salt and 10 grinds of pepper per pound of meat. \r\n\r\nIf you want to add extra garlic powder and onion powder, feel free to do that while browning the meat here too.

After a home workout and some chores, I partake in some THC.\n\nI ask family what time we are eating and decide what time to start cooking according to the recipe. \n\nThe afternoon is chill walks with the dog. Tetris challenges. Hanging out. It's time to start preparing the recipe. \n\nGod. This seems really complicated. Why so many steps? There seems to be ingredients listed that I can't find in my kitchen. I don't want to follow all the steps so I scan key points and throw everything for the stew in except the dairy.\n\nStir, sautee, get bored, walk away.\n\nI put the lid on, scan the recipe one more time. 12 minutes + 12 minutes. Husband taps in and starts clean up from the meal prep.\n\nSit down with the Boy to read a strange story about the wolf's perspective of the 3 little pigs. That was funny.\n\nI look at my husband and say... Noodle Water. And he magically knows to go put the water to boil and that he is now in charge of the egg noodles. He sets his own timer.\n\nAfter the cooking dishes are clean and put away, I have one more task as the rest of the steam releases from the beef stew. I am now totally worried that the food is going to be somehow bad because I didn't follow the recipe. But I push through with my plan and finish the last 3 of 27 steps that I skipped. Add the sour cream and cornstarch. \n\nHusband is taking the water out of the noodles and puts them next to the stew pot. The Boy is setting up the drinking  water and utensils for the 3 place settings without being asked. It's dished up in a few minutes. Dishes are tidy but left for clean up until after we eat. \n\nTurns out I did an okay job. Might be some of those ingredients and steps were important. But it doesn't taste bad and it's not inedible. So we eat a portion and tidy up the leftovers and remaining dishes. Now I am chill on the couch thinking that next time I should just plan to follow the recipe. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk while stonned on a Saturday night.

I hear Air Fryers are good for making crispy chicken so that's something I might want but what would I miss out from not having the Ultra?

I think I would do better if I understood the process more. \n\nI mostly cook chicken. Both thighs and breasts. Granted thighs are easier to cook and not come out dry, but there has to be a way to cook breasts so they are not so dried out. I generally brown them first and then cook. \n\nUsually when I check the temp on most recipes, the meat ends up being well over 200 degrees, when we only need 165. But maybe I don't understand the cooking process.\n\nWhat is the benefit of allowing the meat to continue cooking on self-release? Is the actual cooking being done mostly in the pressure stage? Is the temp of the meat irrelevant when it cooks longer in a pressure cooker? Would the meat be better closer to the 165 temp, as it would normally with stove cooking?\n\nAlso with browning, I have a LOT of trouble with the meat sticking. I believe this is due to the convex surface, the oil runs to the edges. The pot is plenty hot, but the meat does not self release well, so I end up browning it too long.

{"title": "Instant Pot Carrot Ginger Soup", "selftext": "**Ingredients:**\n\n* **3 pounds of carrots,** finely chopped using a mini chopper. Finely chopping helps break down the cell walls of the carrots, releasing their natural sugars and making them easier to cook down into a smooth texture.\n* **1 large onion,** chopped. Onions add depth of flavor and natural sweetness due to the Maillard reaction during saut\u00e9ing, where amino acids and sugars react to create complex flavors.\n* **3 cloves of garlic,** minced. Garlic adds a sharp, savory flavor that mellows as it cooks, enhancing the overall taste profile of the soup.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Ginger provides a warm, spicy note, and its main compound, gingerol, contributes to both the flavor and the health benefits of the soup.\n* **5 cups of vegetable broth.** The broth is the primary liquid, and it helps distribute the flavors evenly throughout the soup while also softening the vegetables.\n* **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Used for saut\u00e9ing, olive oil adds richness and helps in the heat transfer needed to cook the onions, garlic, and spices properly.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Cumin adds an earthy, warm flavor that complements the sweetness of the carrots and the spiciness of the ginger.\n* **Salt and pepper,** to taste. Salt enhances all the flavors in the soup by reducing bitterness and increasing the perception of sweetness.\n* **1 cup of coconut milk.** Coconut milk adds creaminess and a slight sweetness due to its fat content, which emulsifies when blended into the soup, giving it a smooth and luxurious texture.\n* **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Yogurt adds additional creaminess and a slight tang, thanks to its lactic acid content, which can brighten the flavors of the soup.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables:** Set your Instant Pot to the saut\u00e9 function and add **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Heat the oil, then add **1 chopped large onion** and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes. Saut\u00e9ing causes the onions to undergo the Maillard reaction, enhancing their natural sweetness and depth of flavor.\n2. **Add Aromatics:** Add **3 cloves of minced garlic** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Saut\u00e9 for another minute until fragrant. This step helps to release the volatile oils in the garlic and ginger, intensifying their flavors.\n3. **Cook the Carrots and Spices:** Stir in the **3 pounds of finely chopped carrots** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes to coat the carrots in the spices, which allows the flavors to meld. The heat also helps to soften the carrots slightly, making them easier to cook and blend later.\n4. **Add Broth and Pressure Cook:** Pour in **5 cups of vegetable broth** and season with **salt and pepper** to taste. Close and seal the Instant Pot, then set it to manual high pressure for 10-12 minutes. During pressure cooking, the high heat and pressure help break down the fibers in the carrots, allowing them to become very tender, which makes the soup easier to puree and provides a smooth consistency.\n5. **Release Pressure and Add Creamy Ingredients:** Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow for a natural pressure release for about 10 minutes, and then carefully quick-release any remaining pressure. Stir in **1 cup of coconut milk** and **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Adding these creamy components while the soup is still hot helps to evenly distribute their fat content, creating a rich, velvety texture without the need for heavy cream.\n6. **Final Seasoning and Serve:** Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper as needed. The combination of coconut milk and yogurt balances the sweetness of the carrots and the heat from the ginger, creating a well-rounded flavor profile.\n7. **Serve Hot:** Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs or a drizzle of coconut milk if desired. The final soup should be thick, creamy, and flavorful, with the natural sweetness of the carrots balanced by the warmth of the ginger and cumin, and the richness of the coconut milk and yogurt.\n\n\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "created_utc": 1738274289.0, "score": 7, "author": "Known_Milk_3953", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

When I got home, I was so excited, and it was DISGUSTING. Everything tasted completely bitter and the broth distinctly tasted of alcohol. I drank the rest of the wine, so I know the wine wasn't bad too. I mean it was not GOOD wine by any means, but it wasn't off or anything. Also noteworthy, I tried to save the meat thinking I'd just eat it anyway (lol), and when I opened the container a few days later it was like getting punched with a bottle of vodka.  \nWTF happened??

I like that the meat falls apart, but the individual muscle strands are incredibly stringy and still quite tough.\n\nDo I cook even longer?\n\nWhat kind of meat preparation should I do before hand? I brined over night heavy salt, should I brine longer? I want to bite into the meat and have the same fall apart texture, but without the dryness and tough strings. I want to be able to cut it against the grain with a fork!\n\nEDIT: \nI found my perfect solution. Stop pressure cooking, and start using the Sous Vide option on my Instant Pot!\n\n1. Salt rub some Brisket and let it sit in the fridge for 1 to 24hours.\n2. Put about 1/2 inch of oil/grease into the Instant Pot, set it to Saut\u00e9, and after it comes to temperature, then sear each side of the meat for about a minute or two.\n3. Place the meat on a plate, and drain all oil from the pot. (The meat will be extremely tough)\n4. Put meat back the pot (mine nearly filled the entire bottom of the pot).\n5. Pour in water so the meat is 2/3 covered. \n6. Put generous amounts of your favorite seasonings on the meat tops.\n7. Add about 1 tspb salt to the water.\n8. Set the Instant Pot to Sous Vide at about 158F (70C) for 3 days. Every 6 to 12 hours, check the meat with a fork or knife to achieve your desired tenderness. For me, about 2 days is the sweet spot.\n9. Optionally, place the meat on a pan, then into a convection oven, and heat the meat at the highest temperature until the meat/fat outside is crispy.\n\nWow, moist, flavorful, and extremely tender! No dryness. No stringy muscle fibers. Best Brisket I ever ate in my life. Technically this is slow cooking (crockpot), but at a lower temperature than standard crockpots operate.

I do love the stainless steel insert of the Instapot.\nI hate how the seal takes on strong odors from everything that cooks in it.  I\u2019ve tried all the cleaning hacks I can find but the only thing that works for me if to wash and air dry it then store it outside the Instapot. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why they added a slow cooker function when it takes 2-3 hours for the unit to preheat before switching to low slow cook.  I contacted the manufacturer and they said this was \u201cnormal\u201d and to add an extra 3 hours to the slow cook time.  THAT IS NIOT NORMAL!  Make it work right or don\u2019t include the feature.  For fear of poisoning us while it preheats for several hours I stopped using the Instapot for slowcooking and bought a slow cooker with a crock insert.\n\nThe sous vide works ok if you add really hot water (about 130 - 135 F) to the Instapot before hand.  It gets up to temperature fairly quickly. BUT the size of what you can sous vide is very limited by the shape of the vessel (think brisket).\n\nNow to the pressure cooker which is supposedly the forte of this thing. Previously I made a beef stew by other means.  I saved half of the browned beef, onion and garlic and other savouries, deglazed the pan and then froze it.  Today I placed the frozen beef and 2 cups of broth in the Instapot.  After 25 minutes on high and 10 minutes natural pressure release, then fast release I opened the lid and stirred to make sure the meat was separated.  I added carrots and potatoes cut in small pieces.  I set the pressure cooker for another 30 minutes.  First the pressure cooker had to preheat again. After the 30 minute cook time was up the message display said \u201cdo not open lid\u201d for over 30 minutes.  I got tired of waiting so I released the pressure so we could eat.  \nThe liquid had to be thickened.   I expected that.  Finally after almost 2 hours (using this wonderful time saving device) dinner was served.\nThe beef was tough. The potatoes were a little too done and the carrots were a little hard.

I\u2019ve been using my instapot for like 6 years to make rice using a method from the kitchn.com, kinda can\u2019t remember the website now actually, but I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s it. It\u2019s basically 2 cups liquid, 2 cups rice high pressure for 3 min, slow release for 10 min or just rapid release if I\u2019m impatient. \n\nSo started making coconut rice the same way, except 2 cans coconut milk to 2 cups rice high pressure 3 minutes. Did it like this FOR YEARS. Always turned out perfect, Tasted great, no issues at all. \n\nThen, a few months ago was making the coconut rice as usual, and my instapot was not getting up to pressure or sealing at all, and the rice/coconut kept burning and sticking to the bottom. Tried it like twice this way, same thing BOTH TIMES. So aggravating. So then on my 3rd try I used the rice feature which is low pressure for 12 minutes. AND IT WORKED! No issues, And I could eat. \n\nFast forward to today. I go to make coconut rice, I use the rice feature. It gets up to pressure, it seals. I do a slow release, and the rice is burnt on the bottom. \n\nAnyone have an idea about what\u2019s going on here? Or how to fix it? Anything at all would be helpful!\n\nOh!

I waited 45 mins for it to pressurize, and then turned it off, and the chicken was already cooked. Like, what's the point if I can just do it on the stove? \n\nI dropped the lid after the first recipe I cooked in, and while that first thing worked fine, after that I've had problems bringing food to pressure, but I'm not sure if it's the recipe or something with the lid or maybe it's been messed up? I tried to boil several cups of water after burning the bottom with macaroni and it wouldn't pressurize until I took the lid off, removed the ring, and put it back on. Same thing with the enchilada soup, I turned it off after 45 mins, removed the ring and replaced it, and then it pressurized in just a few minutes. It's been venting steam from the float while it's not pressurizing and I'm told that's normal, and there's nothing coming from the sides of the lid, and the inside of the lid looks fine. Any other ideas? Or is this one maybe a dud, or you just can't ever drop the lid? I really want one that's working because I'm replacing a crock pot but right now it's just a fancy hot plate, I don't want to have to remove and replace the ring every time (not to mention dinner is now over an hour late). \n\nThanks! \n\nRecipe here, in case it's needed:  https://www.skinnytaste.com/crock-pot-chicken-enchilada-soup/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/12f43m9/taking_too_long_to_pressurize/", "created_utc": 1680911179.0, "score": 3, "author": "Awesomest_Possumest", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/12f43m9/taking_too_long_to_pressurize/", "html_title": ""}

It\u2019s up to you how you like to prepare your meat, but my rule of thumb is at least 10 grinds of salt and 10 grinds of pepper per pound of meat. \r\n\r\nIf you want to add extra garlic powder and onion powder, feel free to do that while browning the meat here too.

I planned to make it Saturday and I had the recipe for the instapot. All ingredients were purchased in the weekly shop for everything.\n\nToday is Saturday. My first of 4 days off... yay! After a home workout and some chores, I partake in some THC.\n\nI ask family what time we are eating and decide what time to start cooking according to the recipe. \n\nThe afternoon is chill walks with the dog. Tetris challenges. Hanging out. It's time to start preparing the recipe. \n\nGod. This seems really complicated. Why so many steps? There seems to be ingredients listed that I can't find in my kitchen. I don't want to follow all the steps so I scan key points and throw everything for the stew in except the dairy.\n\nStir, sautee, get bored, walk away.\n\nI put the lid on, scan the recipe one more time. 12 minutes + 12 minutes. Husband taps in and starts clean up from the meal prep.\n\nSit down with the Boy to read a strange story about the wolf's perspective of the 3 little pigs. That was funny.\n\nI look at my husband and say... Noodle Water. And he magically knows to go put the water to boil and that he is now in charge of the egg noodles. He sets his own timer.\n\nAfter the cooking dishes are clean and put away, I have one more task as the rest of the steam releases from the beef stew. I am now totally worried that the food is going to be somehow bad because I didn't follow the recipe. But I push through with my plan and finish the last 3 of 27 steps that I skipped. Add the sour cream and cornstarch. \n\nHusband is taking the water out of the noodles and puts them next to the stew pot. The Boy is setting up the drinking  water and utensils for the 3 place settings without being asked. It's dished up in a few minutes. Dishes are tidy but left for clean up until after we eat. \n\nTurns out I did an okay job. Might be some of those ingredients and steps were important. But it doesn't taste bad and it's not inedible. So we eat a portion and tidy up the leftovers and remaining dishes. Now I am chill on the couch thinking that next time I should just plan to follow the recipe. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk while stonned on a Saturday night.

Just 2 steps)", "selftext": "Hey r/instapot, I'm really excited to share my first post with you here! \n\nCan you make instant ramen like Top Ramen, Maruchan, Nissin in an Instant Pot? Yes! \n\nWHY would you want to cook instant ramen in your electric pressure cooker? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nBecause unlike stovetop or microwaves, you can use \"zero minute cooking\" with your Instant Pot! I'll also show you how to add a runny egg on top \ud83d\ude09\n\n#\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73WRITTEN DIRECTIONS\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n\nIngredients: \n\n- 1 or more blocks of ramen\n\n- 1.5-2 cups of water (or more if using 2+ blocks of ramen)\n\nHere are some optional ingredients that you can leave out if you don\u2019t have them, or add if you want to kick this recipe up a notch: \n\n- 1+ eggs\n\n- 1+ servings frozen vegetables like spinach, corn, or whatever you like to put in your ramen\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 1: Add your ramen block to the IP, water, and seasoning packet. If you're using any frozen vegetables, add them here too. \n\nMANUAL PRESSURE (high if you have option) = 0 MINUTES \n\nQuick release.\n\nNot adding an egg? DONE! \n\nWant to add an egg?\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 STEP 2: Prior to QR (because you want residual heat in your IP), crack your raw eggs into a bowl. \n\nWhen ready to add eggs, open your IP after a Quick Release, gently pour raw eggs on top of noodles, close IP lid. I like to put the valve back on \"sealing\" to keep as much heat in as possible. \n\nSet a timer for 5-7m. \n\nOpen pot, check if eggs are fully cooked. \n\nDONE! \n\n(If your eggs aren't cooked yet just close the lid back up, and wait another 1-2m.

First is the quart size, I want to cook 1 to 2 weeks for an individual at a time then put them in glass containers. Is 8qt the way to go or maybe even a 10qt? The second is comparing Ultra vs Duo w/ Air Fryer. They're both the same price, Ultra is supposed to have more options but the Duo w/ Air Fryer has an Air Fryer which the Ultra doesn't, I think? I hear Air Fryers are good for making crispy chicken so that's something I might want but what would I miss out from not having the Ultra? I'm also reading mixed reviews on the Air Fryer part of the Duo not working that well. Would I be better buying a seperate Air Fryer? If I even decide I still want it after using pressure cooker/slow cooker options? and what about the Duo Nova/Duo Plus?\n\nLast when comparing Instapot to Crockpot, I noticed Crockpot has a clear lid. Is this a major downgrade since Instapot can do the same thing as a Crockpot and more?

{"title": "Questions from a newbie", "selftext": "I've had my IP since Christmas and I love it, but I do have a couple questions. \n\nI find cooking times wildly inconsistent with regard to the doneness of meat. I think I would do better if I understood the process more. \n\nI mostly cook chicken. Both thighs and breasts. Granted thighs are easier to cook and not come out dry, but there has to be a way to cook breasts so they are not so dried out. I generally brown them first and then cook. \n\nUsually when I check the temp on most recipes, the meat ends up being well over 200 degrees, when we only need 165. But maybe I don't understand the cooking process.\n\nWhat is the benefit of allowing the meat to continue cooking on self-release? Is the actual cooking being done mostly in the pressure stage? Is the temp of the meat irrelevant when it cooks longer in a pressure cooker? Would the meat be better closer to the 165 temp, as it would normally with stove cooking?\n\nAlso with browning, I have a LOT of trouble with the meat sticking. I believe this is due to the convex surface, the oil runs to the edges. The pot is plenty hot, but the meat does not self release well, so I end up browning it too long.

[Here are some pictures of the finished dish.](https://imgur.com/a/Kinjo) \n\nI'd made a similar dish before in my crockpot and it was hit or miss. This cooked up PERFECTLY! I'm so impressed.

I used cubes of Colby jack rather than cheddar, again since that what we had on hand. \n\nIf you're not a link clicker, here's the recipe:  \n6-8 slices cooked bacon  \n2 pounds boneless chicken breast  \n1 packet ranch seasoning  \n8oz cream cheese  \n1 cup water  \n3 tbs corn starch  \n4oz cheddar cheese  \n\nPlace chicken and cream cheese in the IP. Sprinkle the packet of ranch seasoning over the top. Add one cup water. Place your IP on Manual high pressure for 25 minutes.  \nDo a quick release.  \nRemove chicken only and shred.  \nKeep your IP on low and Mix in cornstarch with a whisk.

{"title": "To vent or not to vent", "selftext": "My wife and I recently got an Instapot this fall and are new to using it.   We have some differing opinions on if the system should be venting while you are using it.    I walked in to the kitchen and it was venting steam during the cooking process of pork.   I was under the impression that it should only be vented when the cooking cycle was complete.   Are there situations when using this that it should be venting the entire time, or is the point of a pressure cooker to ensure the pressure remains in the pot and once the cooking process is complete, then it will release the steam.   I would love some input here from the community.   I tried to explain my position of needing to have the pressure remain in the pot without venting to my wife and I was looked at like an idiot.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/7kh61f/to_vent_or_not_to_vent/", "created_utc": 1513552337.0, "score": 4, "author": "sever420", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/7kh61f/to_vent_or_not_to_vent/", "html_title": ""}
