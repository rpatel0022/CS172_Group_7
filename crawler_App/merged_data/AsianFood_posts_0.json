Place the seitan pieces in a bowl and sprinkle with cornflour, tossing until evenly coated. In a large frying pan or wok, heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the seitan in batches and fry until golden and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain excess oil.\n\n2. In the same pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the sliced onion and bell pepper, saut\u00e9ing for 5-6 minutes until they start to soften. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\n3. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, and chilli flakes (if using). Pour the sauce mixture into the pan with the vegetables and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for 3-4 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.\n\n4. Stir in the cornflour slurry (cornflour mixed with water) and continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens to a glossy consistency. Add the fried seitan back into the pan, tossing to coat them evenly in the sauce.\n\n5. For the spinach, heat the olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the spinach and cook for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n\n6. For the rice, rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with 600ml of water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to low heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.\n\n7. To serve, divide the cooked jasmine rice between four plates. Top with the Mongolian seitan stir-fry and a generous portion of saut\u00e9ed spinach.

Cut the pork belly into half inch slices. In your instant pot pot, add one stalk of green onion cut into three sections, a sliver of ginger, 2 to 3 cloves of garlic and one clove of shallot. Add 6 cups of water. Add one cup of soy sauce, 1/2 cup of shaoxing wine or cooking rice wine, a Chinese spice packet, and 1/4 cup of fried shallots. Add 3 tbstbsp of momkmonkfruit ssweetener or sugar. Then put in athe slices of pork belly. Add 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper. Place the pot in the instant pot and set to 30 mins.   In a mixing bowl, add 2 teaspoon of active dry yeast, 2 cups of warm water, 2 tablespoons of sugar,  1 tbsp of oil, a dash of salt, and 4 cups of all purpose flour.   Turn on the mixer with dough hook and mix for 5-10 minutes. Once the dough has formed and the bottom of the mixing bowl is clean, stop the mixer and remove the bowl.   Move the dough onto a pastry board or any surface you can knead your dough. Turn the dough and knead until smooth. cut the dough in half. We are using half of the dough to make regular bao buns and the other half we will save to make kawaii character buns which will be in my next video. Roll the dough into a long loaf and cut into 6 even sections. Portion the dough into balls and let rest for 5 minutes.\u00a0In the meantime, grab your bamboo steamers and line with parchment paper.   In a small bowl, prepare some cooking oil and a brush.   Knead the dough using the heel of your palm until the dough surface is smooth. Roll the dough into a smooth ball and use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to about 6 inches in length. Make sure the top and bottom remains in the crescent shape.   Brush the oil onto the top of the dough. Gently grab the bottom of the dough and fold it up in half.   Place the bao onto the steamer and cover  them with a damp kitchen towel or wet paper towel and let the dough rest for 30-45 minutes until it has doubled in size,   In a food processor, crush some roasted peanuts into fine crumbs. Then add a teaspoon of monkfruit sweetener or sugar and mix.   In a steamer pan, add 1 cup of water and turn on medium high heat. Place the bamboo steamers onto the pan and close the lid. Steam for 10 minutes.   Our bao buns are now ready for assembly.  Take one bun and open to fill with the braised pork belly. Put as many as your heart desires. Then add the pickled mustard greens. These have been chopped and stirred fried with garlic and chili pepper. Then top with the crushed peanut mixture we made. As you know I always like to make my recipes more unique so I\u2019m adding some grated salted egg yolks onto my bao to make it even more tastier. And finally garnish with some fresh cilantro,"]}

{"title": "Soup dumpling review!", "selftext": "I live just outside of Richmond, VA and the Asian food scene is growing rapidly and I'm loving it! On top of that, brands like Mila and Laoban are now at my local Krogers (just in smaller bags). Here are my thoughts:\n\n*Notice* I've had Mila brand soup dumplings before and I enjoy them, this is just a comparison in quality and packaging, not taste as that is subjective to each person.\n\nI bought two bags of each brand and looking at the outside, both bags of soup dumplings are very modern and fun looking. The Laoban brand is 8oz (225g) and contained 9 dumplings consistently. It has a resealable closure if you're not going to eat/make a whole bag in one sitting. The Mila brand is a little heavier at 8.8oz (250g) and consistently contains 10 dumplings (one more than Laoban). It does not have a resealable closure for those who won't/don't make the whole bag in one sitting. The instructions on both brands do offer instructions for how to steam or pan fry the dumplings and the timing/heat is pretty much the same (+/- 1min).\n\nOpening up the Laoban bag I noticed that the resealable closure wasn't secured correctly and made that feature moot. The second bag also did not have the closure glued/sealed onto the bag correctly. There is no prepared parchment paper included (which is mentioned in the steam cooking instructions). Where as the Mila brand does include one prepared parchment paper for the 8.8oz bag. And since there is no closure there isn't an issue of improperly made closures.\n\nThe frozen dumplings for the Laoban dumplings are irregular in shape and looks a little more homemade, but the pleats on top doesn't seem hand pleated. It could be the irregularities are related to wrapper ; filling ratio and/or the consistency of the filling allowing the dumplings to freeze irregularly. The Mila brand dumplings look more uniform while frozen and the pleats on top are also not hand sealed (a little more obviously than the Laoban brand).\n\nAfter steaming for per instructions, the Laoban brand still comes out looking homemade with it looking irregular from each dumpling. Whereas the Mila brand maintains their consistent look from frozen to cooked with out much change from dumpling to dumpling. I don't know if the irregularities of the Laoban brand might be causing increased risk of leakage from the dumplings during/after steaming. \n\nWhen I bit into the Laoban dumplings I noticed that there were some dumplings with more soup than other. The wrapper is softer and thinner than a traditional dumpling wrapper in texture and is on the cusp of being chewy. The filing for the dumplings tend to be looser in consistency and falls apart easily when bit into or picked up with chopsticks. Some could take that consistency as \"mushy.\" Mila consistently maintains about the same amount of soup per dumpling and the wrappers are slightly thicker and over \"al dente\" when bit into but is similar to the steamed non-soup dumplings. The filling has almost a meatball consistency where it's firm and doesn't fall apart easily when picked up or bit into.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed both, but my personal preference is still Mila \u263a\ufe0f.

It\u2019s quick to make, and ridiculously delicious!  \nThis is a recipe for using fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes. This recipe is inspired by popular Chinese tomato egg drop soup, but here I use silken tofu as a replacement for eggs and also add enoki mushroom for some texture.

Silken tofu is also known as soft tofu, it has a smooth and \u201csilky\u201d appearance. It\u2019s very light in texture with a wonderful, creamy mouthfeel and fatty flavor. Just a reminder, some silken tofu in Asian groceries contain eggs, don\u2019t forget to check the label before purchasing. If you can\u2019t find silken tofu in the shops, regular firm tofu is a replacement for this recipe. But Not firm tofu or extra-firm tofu!  \n(Note2)- Shallots( Scallion or Spring Onion)- We need 2-3 springs of shallots. Use the white parts for frying with tomatoes, the green parts for garnish.  \n(Note3)- Store brought low-sodium vegetable broth or if you like to make your own, check this recipe out How to make Asian-Style Vegetable Stock  \nMore printable Vegan delicious recipes are at https://joyfuldumplings.com/  \nIf you like my recipes, please sign up for my newsletter and share the recipes."]}

In my home country, we call it agak-agak aka guesstimate cooking style!)\n- 500 gm Dried Peanuts with skin on\n- 1-2 tsp 5 spice powder\n- 4-5 star anise\n- 2-3 cinnamon bark (I used Sri Lankan cinnamon bark NOT the usual cassia bark)\n- 8-10 pieces cloves\n- 2-4 bay leaves \n- 2-4 tablespoons light soya sauce\n- 2 tablespoons dark/black soya sauce (cooking caramel)\n- 15-30 gm sugar/rock sugar or prefered sweetener\n- 1.5 liters of water\n- 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil\n- optional items include but not limited to ginger, garlic, dates, dong gui, peppercorn, dried chili, salt, etc.)\n\nMethod:\n1. Wash and soak peanuts overnight (at least 8 hours)\n2. After over night soak, rinse and add into a pot, cover with water and bring to boil. Let it boil for about 3-5 minutes. This is to remove some bitter after tastes from the peanuts. Do not boil longer than 5 minutes. Drain the water.\n3. In a small pan, heat up 1 Tbs oil and toast star anise, cloves and cinnamon bark, until aromatic.\n4. Add some water (from 1.5 liters), add 5 spice powder, light soya sauce, dark soya sauce, sugar and bring to boil. Let it boil for about 3-5 minutes.\n5. In your main pressure cooker pot, add bay leaves and the balance of water and start boiling.\n6. Transfer the pot of boiling spices into your main pot. Bring to boil.\n7. Add peanuts and mixed well.\n8. Close lid and allow to boil (at high heat) until the whistle blow, and continue to boil for 15 minutes.\n9. After 15 minutes, lower fire to lowest and continue to simmer for the next 45 minutes.\n10. Turn off heat/fire after 15 minutes and allow the peanuts to continue to simmer under pressure until all pressure is release as it cools down.\n11. Open lid and you should have a nice soft, yet firm peanuts with just enough braising liquid at the bottom.\n12. Transfer into bowl to cool down before transferring into container to be kept in the fridge. Can eat immediately.

Open a can of mikan, aka mandarin orange\n2. Separate the mikan of the syrup it's likely canned together with through a strainer on top of a bowl\n3. Pour 200 cc of water in a cooking pot\n4. Add 4 grams of agar powder in pot\n5. Put cooking pot on stove top\n6. Turn the heat on to high to boil\n7. Stir the pot\n8. After the liquid boils, turn heat down to medium low\n9. Constantly stir  pot for 2 to 3 minutes\n10. After 2 to 3 minutes are over, add 30 grams of sugar into pot\n11. After you add sugar, turn off heat\n12. With the heat off, add 400 cc of milk\n13. Stir to mix everything together\n14. Pour milk mixture through a strainer to make the liquid smooth\n15. When  milk mixture has cooled down but still warm and a liquid, pour mixture into your preferred  serving cup or bowl\n16. Add mikan into the cup, leaving a few pieces to garnish the top of the jelly later\n17. Leave jelly in the fridge to solidify & cool down, at least for 2 hours\n18. After the jelly has solidified, garnish top of the jelly with a few pieces of mikan\n\nYou can now enjoy eating the mikan milk agar jelly or put it back in the fridge to eat later, the longer in the fridge the colder it will be, like overnight.\n\nEnjoy making it and eating it too!"]}

Although, I've made a recent observation that not everyone has the same method of grilling KBBQ (table style grilling).\n\nI grew up where my family would cook our meat in smaller batches, leaving enough room for each unrolled piece of meat to lay flat. Once cooked, you flip the slices to grill the other side. Neat and simple. We would grill like this whether we ate at a restaurant or on our own portable table grill at home.\n\nOn the contrary, my college friends will dump a whole plate straight on the grill, leaving no room for the meat to spread out or cook evenly. They'd pretty much stir fry it all at once. My first time seeing this, I was baffled. It felt barbaric. It felt wrong.\n\nMy boyfriend tells me that this is normal college student behavior and everyone does this. But do they really??  It gets overcrowded and the meat burns if not eaten fast enough. Sure it's efficient, but I feel like this ruins the quality of the good meat we are paying to eat.\n\nCan someone tell me if I'm the only one who cooks their KBBQ like this? If you do grill like my college friends, can you explain why?\n\ntldr; I've always grilled my meat at kbbq in small batches with the meat laying flat to cook evenly.

It comes out of the package, it is sliced, partially fried, and portioned out, then stored to be cooked per entree. They finish frying it when you actually order the dish, whatever it is. It's that double fry that gave it that golden super crispy taste, also it makes your entree come out in 5 minutes instead of 15.\n\nYou can do the same thing at home however, buy extra firm tofu, do your best to drain it, slice it up how you want it, then freeze it. If you have the patience, you can get what you're looking for with a nice shallow pan fry, but definitely deep fry it in a neutral oil if you want that restaurant crispiness, especially if you're making it saucy.\n\nPeople will tell you to press the tofu to get all the water out, and that's great if you have time and patience but not absolutely necessary if you're going to freeze and fry, always a great idea though... Also, tofu is not chicken, so you don't have to batter it to deep fry, but a light dusting of cornstarch will definitely help you."]}

This is what you need:\n\n**Lentils** \\- I use brown, red or French lentils to make soups and add them raw. Lentils love lentils because they are soft and nutritious. They are low in fiber, B vitamins, iron, protein and fat.\n\n**Garlic, onion and carrot** add nutrients, texture and color to the soup.\n\n**Cumin powder, coriander powder and powder turmeric** add flavor and color. Stock \u2014 For vegetarian/vegan lentil soup, use vegetable stock ( here's our recipe ) or use chicken stock ( here's ours ).\n\n**Kale or spinach** adds nutrition to the soup. You need fresh lemons for this soup. It really brings out all the flavors.

And the heat-loving Minangs dial up their Masak Lemak with great fistfuls of cili api (or cili padi/bird\u2019s eye chilli). The gulai sauce is made with lots of turmeric, coconut milk, heavy use of aromatics and spices, and it can be cooked with various proteins such as chicken, fish, beef, seafood, or egg. Fruits and vegetables can be added to the dish to add more layers of complexity and flavours too. The dish is usually served accompanied by sambal, rice, and raw vegetables (ulam).\n\nMasak Lemak Cili Api can be enjoyed throughout Malaysia and it tastes amazing.

So MSG and chicken stock is banned in my mom's kitchen XD.

Let\u2019s give the chicken a few cuts, so that it will be easier for it to absorb more flavors.\n\n2. Cut the garlic and ginger. You can cut them into slices or cubes, as you would prefer.\n\n3.. Next, we need to clean the chicken. Prepare the wok with cold water and turn on the stove, put the chicken into it. When the water starts to boil, take out the meat. This is a very common step in Chinese meat cooking. We don\u2019t really want to cook through the meat but only to clean away the blood and unpleasant taste, if that makes sense to you.\n\n4. Rinse the chicken so that any possible foam that has stuck to it can be washed away.\n\n5. Ok, now we are ready to cook. Put in some oil, when the oil is heated up, let\u2019s stir fry some garlic and ginger. Wait till the fragrance comes out. And then put the chicken into the wok. \n\n6. We are going to fry each side of the chicken around 5 minutes, until each side is golden brown.\n\n7. Add in 3 spoons of Chinese cooking wine. Again, as I always say, if you don\u2019t have it, you can use beers to substitute it.  Add in 3 spoons of Soy sauce. And a few pinches of salt.\n\n8. Stir for about 2 minutes, now add in the most important ingredient of this dish, coca cola.\n\n10. Put on a tap on the wok and Leave it to stew for around 15 minutes with medium low heat, until the sauce thickens.\n\n11. Remove the tap and stir the chicken to make the sauce evenly wraps the chicken.\n\n12. Now take out the chicken and add some sesame seeds for decoration.\n\n   ="]}

{"title": "Fila Manila, a FilAm owned startup bringing Filipino flavors across the USA", "selftext": "Hello everyone! This is my first time posting on Reddit so thanks in advance for your patience. My name is Jake Deleon, founder of [Fila Manila](https://filamanila.com/),  a Filipino food startup that makes Filipino sauces, condiments, and spreads that are sold in stores like Target and Whole Foods Market.\n\nI was born in the Philippines but moved to NJ with my family when I was a  toddler. It was then that I had my earliest memory in the food   business  which was helping my mom make lumpia and turon in the kitchen.   We would  sell these to friends and family for extra household income.   With most  FilAm immigrants, we did not have much money so any extra   side hustle  was critical.\n\nI started my first  food business, an almond milk company, in 2016 with a 4   ft. table at a  farmers market in NJ. I grew the almond milk business to distribution  with Walmart and Whole Foods and had KraftHeinz as our earliest investor. We were doing very well in the years after and had   our biggest  revenue month in February 2020. But sadly, like many  other  businesses,  the COVID lockdowns greatly impacted our business  with \\~80%  of revenue declining over 6 weeks. I ended up closing down  that  business.\n\nIt  was during  this dark  time in May 2020 that I saw an article that  highlighted that  in some  areas of the US, 20% of the healthcare  workforce fighting on  the front  lines of COVID were Pinoy. I know most  Filipino families are  notorious  for having so many employed nurses,  technicians, or  doctors-- but this  was a mind-blown moment for me. So  much so that it  inspired me to do  more research on our people. And it  turns out... we  are a thing! At the  time, Filipinos were the 2nd largest  Asian  American community, the  largest in 11 states incl. California.  But  then my mind thought about  the food industry from where I came from.  I  thought to myself, \"If our  community is so huge in the US why is   there almost no representation of  our food in most major grocery   stores\"? You would have to go to the  Asian or Filipino grocery store  and  find the imports.\n\nI  knew in  my  heart that Filipino food deserved its time in the spotlight  and  that our  people and culture were primed to make our voices known  in  the US. And  that conviction led me to start Fila Manila, the 1st   Filipino American  food brand.\n\n**I need your help!**    I started Fila Manila in 2020 with my stimulus check after investors    said NOPE. Since then, I've built the company into a #1 brand in the  US   with nationwide distribution and three award-winning product lines.\n\nI was selected as a Top 3 finalist, out of 100s of startups across the USA, at the [Sweater](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sweaterventures/) VC Barnburner Pitch Competition in NYC where I pitched on stage for a chance to win a $250,000 investment. **The winner is determined by vote... and I am asking for your vote!**    Follow the simple steps below and you can watch my entire pitch on  the   event page. We will use the funds to continue building towards our    vision to represent the next generation of Filipino American flavors.

{"title": "How different are Shaoxing wine and Mirin?", "selftext": "So over the last few years I've come to try out more and more Asian recipes or Asian-inspired recipes. When I do I always try to find a good balance between including and discovering authentic ingredients and keeping things practical and affordable.\n\nOne of my major issues is that live with friends. So we all have limited storage space in the kitchen. Because of that I try to limit the amount of ingredients I have lying around. Of course I have my handy dandy cupboard staples. But personally I just can't justify having a bottle of rice vinegar AND brown rice vinegar AND sushi vinegar clogging up my valuable cupboard space at the same time.\n\nI understand there is a difference in these products flavourwise. And that certain recipes are preferably made with a specific kind. But as I said, on a practical sense that doesn't always work for me.\n\nOn the other hand (for example) I will have different types of soy sauce on hand. Like dark soy, light soy, shoyu etc. Because as products they differ a lot and I tend to use them a lot and do find that having each on hand makes sense.\n\nMirin is also one of my cupboard staples. And in the past I've used it as a sub with Shaoxing wine before in small quantities. But there are a few recipes I want to try that talk about tbsp of Shaoxing wine rather than tsp and I'm starting to wonder if it would be worth it for me to purchase?\n\nSo does anyone have any advice for me on this front? Should I pick up some Shaoxing wine next them I hit the Asian grocery store or are they similar enough that it's fine to keep using Mirin as a substitute?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/asianfood/comments/13e034l/how_different_are_shaoxing_wine_and_mirin/", "created_utc": 1683745569.0, "score": 3, "author": "Le_Fancy_Me", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/asianfood/comments/13e034l/how_different_are_shaoxing_wine_and_mirin/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Mirin is much sweeter than shaoxing (which has a slightly savory / almost smoky flavor), so it\u2019s not a great substitute for dishes that call for more shaoxing than a splash. \n\nIf you have to rationalize the list, I\u2019d actually go with a neutral cooking wine like michu (Taiwanese rice wine) or cooking sake (Japanese rice wine that isn\u2019t mirin). Both can be used in marinades and cooking. \n\nIf you can make space, I think it\u2019s still worth stocking shaoxing. There are certain dishes (eg drunken chicken) that really can\u2019t be made without it. It\u2019d be like trying to make beef bourguignon without red wine and wondering if port or white wine would do.", "I think it also matters which cuisine/countries you tend to cook and enjoy. So for example, if you tend towards Japanese more and cook Chinese only once in a while, then focus more on good Japanese ingredients. \n\nThat said, if there\u2019s a dish from a particular country you cook only a little of, but you cook it often, it might be worth it to invest (even in just a smaller bottle, rather than buying the big value bottle). I\u2019ve also asked around and split ingredients with friends who like to cook, which was helpful for my kitchen storage. \n\nIn this case, I think for the best value of space, I agree, it makes sense to get a nice sake to substitute for the shaoxing wine. Japanese food tends to be delicate and mild, so the sake gives you more flexibility. \n\nI say all of this as a person who has waaay too many sauces, spices, and condiments lol", "How different?  They are very different!", "Shaoxing is like 3 bucks a bottle isn't it", "I can never find Shaoxing here in central FL. Mirin is no substitute, sherry is good and cheap and you can drink it as a dessert wine too. I generally get Taylor or Harvey's Bristol Cream. I have a batch of rice wine brewing that should be really close to Shaoxing as I used chinese rice balls to start it. I won't know for a couple weeks yet. Good luck."]}

Perhaps your palate simply isn\u2019t suited to Filipino cuisine. \n\nSimilarly, I never have liked Greek food. I\u2019ve tried it in a few different countries (though not Greece) and at different price points, from street food stands to family owned restaurants and even a bougier one. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, I\u2019m just not a fan, personally. And that\u2019s okay, but there\u2019s no need to disparage the entire cuisine because it doesn\u2019t scratch your itch."]}

Discard the water.\n\nPut rice back in the pan.\nAdd 2 cups fresh water (normal temperature) to rice.\n\nCover and cook on low to medium-low heat till done.\n\nDo not open lid. Don't do anything.\n\nAfter cooking, remove from heat. Leave lid in place for 15 mins. Fluff with a fork before serving.\u00a0"]}

You would just have all the ingredients prepped and on the table with pre-made Vietnamese peanut butter dipping sauce & Siracha, everyone sits around the table with a plate large enough to fit the circumference of the spring roll and everyone can make their own custom spring rolls. The ingredients we used were: spring roll rice wraps (have a large bowl of warm water on the table for everyone to submerge there individual wraps in), cooked vermicelli noodles, sliced Romaine lettuce, cooked ground pork or any other proteins you guys prefer, sliced cucumber, shredded carrots & a plate of herbs (we use cilantro, green onions & mint). These were always surprisingly filling after just about three rolls per person. Also, you don\u2019t need to have ever rolled these before so don\u2019t be intimidated. Part of the fun is seeing the funny shapes people make with their custom spring rolls. Fried rice would pair well with these if you\u2019re afraid the spring rolls won\u2019t be enough food."]}
