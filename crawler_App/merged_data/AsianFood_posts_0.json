They're typically a buck or two more per package compared to the Great Value brand. For sure, their bronze cut pastas are very good and so are a handful of other products I've tried like the granola and chocolate bars.\n\nBUT... I wasted $10 on sauce so you don't have to. First, all 3 sauces are just pure syrup. If you suck down duck sauce and sweet and sour packets en masse from the local American Chinese takeaway joint, you may not mind this.\n\nWhat is unforgivable, however, is how strongly of ginger the two Korean sauces taste. Completely unbalanced and medicinal. It's not even that peppery hot ginger. It's just not good, nauseating ginger.\n\nThen there's the orange sauce that doesn't even taste of orange. It's just sweet goop. I think they call it orange because that's what color it is.\n\nThankfully, even my podunk, hillbilly town has two Lao Gan Ma products as well as the Fly By Jing, Mae Ploy, Bibigo and Kewpie.

Place the seitan pieces in a bowl and sprinkle with cornflour, tossing until evenly coated. In a large frying pan or wok, heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the seitan in batches and fry until golden and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain excess oil.\n\n2. In the same pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the sliced onion and bell pepper, saut\u00e9ing for 5-6 minutes until they start to soften. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\n3. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, and chilli flakes (if using). Pour the sauce mixture into the pan with the vegetables and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for 3-4 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.\n\n4. Stir in the cornflour slurry (cornflour mixed with water) and continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens to a glossy consistency. Add the fried seitan back into the pan, tossing to coat them evenly in the sauce.\n\n5. For the spinach, heat the olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the spinach and cook for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n\n6. For the rice, rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with 600ml of water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to low heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.\n\n7. To serve, divide the cooked jasmine rice between four plates. Top with the Mongolian seitan stir-fry and a generous portion of saut\u00e9ed spinach.

{"title": "Soup dumpling review!", "selftext": "I live just outside of Richmond, VA and the Asian food scene is growing rapidly and I'm loving it! On top of that, brands like Mila and Laoban are now at my local Krogers (just in smaller bags). Here are my thoughts:\n\n*Notice* I've had Mila brand soup dumplings before and I enjoy them, this is just a comparison in quality and packaging, not taste as that is subjective to each person.\n\nI bought two bags of each brand and looking at the outside, both bags of soup dumplings are very modern and fun looking. The Laoban brand is 8oz (225g) and contained 9 dumplings consistently. It has a resealable closure if you're not going to eat/make a whole bag in one sitting. The Mila brand is a little heavier at 8.8oz (250g) and consistently contains 10 dumplings (one more than Laoban). It does not have a resealable closure for those who won't/don't make the whole bag in one sitting. The instructions on both brands do offer instructions for how to steam or pan fry the dumplings and the timing/heat is pretty much the same (+/- 1min).\n\nOpening up the Laoban bag I noticed that the resealable closure wasn't secured correctly and made that feature moot. The second bag also did not have the closure glued/sealed onto the bag correctly. There is no prepared parchment paper included (which is mentioned in the steam cooking instructions). Where as the Mila brand does include one prepared parchment paper for the 8.8oz bag. And since there is no closure there isn't an issue of improperly made closures.\n\nThe frozen dumplings for the Laoban dumplings are irregular in shape and looks a little more homemade, but the pleats on top doesn't seem hand pleated. It could be the irregularities are related to wrapper ; filling ratio and/or the consistency of the filling allowing the dumplings to freeze irregularly. The Mila brand dumplings look more uniform while frozen and the pleats on top are also not hand sealed (a little more obviously than the Laoban brand).\n\nAfter steaming for per instructions, the Laoban brand still comes out looking homemade with it looking irregular from each dumpling. Whereas the Mila brand maintains their consistent look from frozen to cooked with out much change from dumpling to dumpling. I don't know if the irregularities of the Laoban brand might be causing increased risk of leakage from the dumplings during/after steaming. \n\nWhen I bit into the Laoban dumplings I noticed that there were some dumplings with more soup than other. The wrapper is softer and thinner than a traditional dumpling wrapper in texture and is on the cusp of being chewy. The filing for the dumplings tend to be looser in consistency and falls apart easily when bit into or picked up with chopsticks. Some could take that consistency as \"mushy.\" Mila consistently maintains about the same amount of soup per dumpling and the wrappers are slightly thicker and over \"al dente\" when bit into but is similar to the steamed non-soup dumplings. The filling has almost a meatball consistency where it's firm and doesn't fall apart easily when picked up or bit into.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed both, but my personal preference is still Mila \u263a\ufe0f. If you've tried both brands id love to hear your thoughts too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h0gscx", "created_utc": 1732640627.0, "score": 18, "author": "GreenhouseGrower", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/asianfood/comments/1h0gscx/soup_dumpling_review/", "html_title": ""}

Begin by preparing the tofu. Wrap the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and set a heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes to expel excess moisture. After pressing, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.\n2. Cook the jasmine rice as per the package instructions until each grain is separate and tender. Fluff with a fork once done and cover to retain warmth.\n3. In a non-stick skillet, warm the sesame oil over medium flame. Once hot, add the tofu cubes. Saut\u00e9, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden and crispy, approximately 8-10 minutes.\n4. As the tofu cooks, prepare the sticky sauce. In a small mixing bowl, combine the minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, gochujang, and rice vinegar. Stir until well mixed.\n5. Once the tofu is cooked, reduce the skillet's heat to low. Carefully pour the sauce mixture over the crispy tofu. Let it simmer gently, frequently stirring, until the sauce thickens and adheres to the tofu, creating a glossy coating (about 5 minutes).\n6. To serve, spoon the fluffy jasmine rice into bowls. Top with a generous helping of the spicy sticky tofu.

In my home country, we call it agak-agak aka guesstimate cooking style!)\n- 500 gm Dried Peanuts with skin on\n- 1-2 tsp 5 spice powder\n- 4-5 star anise\n- 2-3 cinnamon bark (I used Sri Lankan cinnamon bark NOT the usual cassia bark)\n- 8-10 pieces cloves\n- 2-4 bay leaves \n- 2-4 tablespoons light soya sauce\n- 2 tablespoons dark/black soya sauce (cooking caramel)\n- 15-30 gm sugar/rock sugar or prefered sweetener\n- 1.5 liters of water\n- 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil\n- optional items include but not limited to ginger, garlic, dates, dong gui, peppercorn, dried chili, salt, etc.)\n\nMethod:\n1. Wash and soak peanuts overnight (at least 8 hours)\n2. After over night soak, rinse and add into a pot, cover with water and bring to boil. Let it boil for about 3-5 minutes. This is to remove some bitter after tastes from the peanuts. Do not boil longer than 5 minutes. Drain the water.\n3. In a small pan, heat up 1 Tbs oil and toast star anise, cloves and cinnamon bark, until aromatic.\n4. Add some water (from 1.5 liters), add 5 spice powder, light soya sauce, dark soya sauce, sugar and bring to boil. Let it boil for about 3-5 minutes.\n5. In your main pressure cooker pot, add bay leaves and the balance of water and start boiling.\n6. Transfer the pot of boiling spices into your main pot. Bring to boil.\n7. Add peanuts and mixed well.\n8. Close lid and allow to boil (at high heat) until the whistle blow, and continue to boil for 15 minutes.\n9. After 15 minutes, lower fire to lowest and continue to simmer for the next 45 minutes.\n10. Turn off heat/fire after 15 minutes and allow the peanuts to continue to simmer under pressure until all pressure is release as it cools down.\n11. Open lid and you should have a nice soft, yet firm peanuts with just enough braising liquid at the bottom.\n12.

Although, I've made a recent observation that not everyone has the same method of grilling KBBQ (table style grilling).\n\nI grew up where my family would cook our meat in smaller batches, leaving enough room for each unrolled piece of meat to lay flat. Once cooked, you flip the slices to grill the other side. Neat and simple. We would grill like this whether we ate at a restaurant or on our own portable table grill at home.\n\nOn the contrary, my college friends will dump a whole plate straight on the grill, leaving no room for the meat to spread out or cook evenly. They'd pretty much stir fry it all at once. My first time seeing this, I was baffled. It felt barbaric. It felt wrong.\n\nMy boyfriend tells me that this is normal college student behavior and everyone does this. But do they really??  It gets overcrowded and the meat burns if not eaten fast enough. Sure it's efficient, but I feel like this ruins the quality of the good meat we are paying to eat.\n\nCan someone tell me if I'm the only one who cooks their KBBQ like this? If you do grill like my college friends, can you explain why?\n\ntldr; I've always grilled my meat at kbbq in small batches with the meat laying flat to cook evenly. My friends put whole plates on the grill to quickly cook it all at once.

This is what you need:\n\n**Lentils** \\- I use brown, red or French lentils to make soups and add them raw. Lentils love lentils because they are soft and nutritious. They are low in fiber, B vitamins, iron, protein and fat.\n\n**Garlic, onion and carrot** add nutrients, texture and color to the soup.\n\n**Cumin powder, coriander powder and powder turmeric** add flavor and color. Stock \u2014 For vegetarian/vegan lentil soup, use vegetable stock ( here's our recipe ) or use chicken stock ( here's ours ).\n\n**Kale or spinach** adds nutrition to the soup. You need fresh lemons for this soup. It really brings out all the flavors. I also add lemon slices when I serve the dishes.\n\nFresh herbs are optional, but I like to add fresh dill or parsley if I have them. Do you like lentils?

{"title": "Fila Manila, a FilAm owned startup bringing Filipino flavors across the USA", "selftext": "Hello everyone! This is my first time posting on Reddit so thanks in advance for your patience. My name is Jake Deleon, founder of [Fila Manila](https://filamanila.com/),  a Filipino food startup that makes Filipino sauces, condiments, and spreads that are sold in stores like Target and Whole Foods Market.\n\nI was born in the Philippines but moved to NJ with my family when I was a  toddler. It was then that I had my earliest memory in the food   business  which was helping my mom make lumpia and turon in the kitchen.   We would  sell these to friends and family for extra household income.   With most  FilAm immigrants, we did not have much money so any extra   side hustle  was critical.\n\nI started my first  food business, an almond milk company, in 2016 with a 4   ft. table at a  farmers market in NJ. I grew the almond milk business to distribution  with Walmart and Whole Foods and had KraftHeinz as our earliest investor. We were doing very well in the years after and had   our biggest  revenue month in February 2020. But sadly, like many  other  businesses,  the COVID lockdowns greatly impacted our business  with \\~80%  of revenue declining over 6 weeks. I ended up closing down  that  business.\n\nIt  was during  this dark  time in May 2020 that I saw an article that  highlighted that  in some  areas of the US, 20% of the healthcare  workforce fighting on  the front  lines of COVID were Pinoy. I know most  Filipino families are  notorious  for having so many employed nurses,  technicians, or  doctors-- but this  was a mind-blown moment for me. So  much so that it  inspired me to do  more research on our people. And it  turns out... we  are a thing! At the  time, Filipinos were the 2nd largest  Asian  American community, the  largest in 11 states incl. California.  But  then my mind thought about  the food industry from where I came from.  I  thought to myself, \"If our  community is so huge in the US why is   there almost no representation of  our food in most major grocery   stores\"? You would have to go to the  Asian or Filipino grocery store  and  find the imports.\n\nI  knew in  my  heart that Filipino food deserved its time in the spotlight  and  that our  people and culture were primed to make our voices known  in  the US. And  that conviction led me to start Fila Manila, the 1st   Filipino American  food brand.\n\n**I need your help!**    I started Fila Manila in 2020 with my stimulus check after investors    said NOPE. Since then, I've built the company into a #1 brand in the  US   with nationwide distribution and three award-winning product lines.\n\nI was selected as a Top 3 finalist, out of 100s of startups across the USA, at the [Sweater](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sweaterventures/) VC Barnburner Pitch Competition in NYC where I pitched on stage for a chance to win a $250,000 investment. **The winner is determined by vote... and I am asking for your vote!**    Follow the simple steps below and you can watch my entire pitch on  the   event page. We will use the funds to continue building towards our    vision to represent the next generation of Filipino American flavors.

{"title": "How different are Shaoxing wine and Mirin?", "selftext": "So over the last few years I've come to try out more and more Asian recipes or Asian-inspired recipes. When I do I always try to find a good balance between including and discovering authentic ingredients and keeping things practical and affordable.\n\nOne of my major issues is that live with friends. So we all have limited storage space in the kitchen. Because of that I try to limit the amount of ingredients I have lying around. Of course I have my handy dandy cupboard staples. But personally I just can't justify having a bottle of rice vinegar AND brown rice vinegar AND sushi vinegar clogging up my valuable cupboard space at the same time.\n\nI understand there is a difference in these products flavourwise. And that certain recipes are preferably made with a specific kind. But as I said, on a practical sense that doesn't always work for me.\n\nOn the other hand (for example) I will have different types of soy sauce on hand. Like dark soy, light soy, shoyu etc. Because as products they differ a lot and I tend to use them a lot and do find that having each on hand makes sense.\n\nMirin is also one of my cupboard staples. And in the past I've used it as a sub with Shaoxing wine before in small quantities. But there are a few recipes I want to try that talk about tbsp of Shaoxing wine rather than tsp and I'm starting to wonder if it would be worth it for me to purchase?\n\nSo does anyone have any advice for me on this front? Should I pick up some Shaoxing wine next them I hit the Asian grocery store or are they similar enough that it's fine to keep using Mirin as a substitute?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/asianfood/comments/13e034l/how_different_are_shaoxing_wine_and_mirin/", "created_utc": 1683745569.0, "score": 3, "author": "Le_Fancy_Me", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/asianfood/comments/13e034l/how_different_are_shaoxing_wine_and_mirin/", "html_title": ""}
