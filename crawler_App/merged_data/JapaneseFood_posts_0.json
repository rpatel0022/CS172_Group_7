{"title": "My biggest regret in Tokyo. \u201cJust a quick bite I said\u201d.", "selftext": "While wandering through Ginza, I felt a growing hunger for sushi. A quick Google search and a few GPS directions led me to a small, narrow alley, where I found a seemingly inconspicuous restaurant. Assuming it was my destination, I stepped inside and announced my arrival. The chef emerged, looking surprised, and I felt an awkward pang of guilt about leaving abruptly. I decided to stay for a quick bite before heading to the sushi spot that beckoned me.\n\nLittle did I realize, the chef's surprise was not a welcoming one. \n\nIt turned out to be a tempura restaurant. Thinking it wouldn't be too bad, I watched as the chef meticulously prepared fresh batter and heated the oil to the perfect temperature. My culinary journey began with fugu jelly, catching me off guard as I hadn't even seen a menu yet. Before I could process this, a parade of tiny shrimp tempura started landing on my plate, interspersed with vegetables. It felt like an endless stream of shrimp tempura\u2014probably around thirty pieces in total.\n\nAs I wondered what I had gotten myself into, concerns about the cost began to creep in. When the bill arrived, I was floored: $600 USD. The experience took an even stranger turn when two \"gentlemen\" walked in, shocked to see me there. In perfect English, they asked, \"Why are you here? We don't usually see normal folks or tourists here.\"\n\nWhere was I, indeed?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d5t5mn", "created_utc": 1717265741.0, "score": 6222, "author": "SushiAssassin-", "num_comments": 331, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1d5t5mn/my_biggest_regret_in_tokyo_just_a_quick_bite_i/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "[I made] Slipper Lobster Chawanmushi with Lobster Butter ", "selftext": "A while ago I tried this crab Chawanmushi at Chaco Bar in Potts Point Sydney Australia. Covered in a sweet crustacean butter it was insanely rich, indulgent and blew my mind. Ever since I\u2019d been thinking about trying to make it myself. Now I\u2019m no good at lobster diving but a good mate said he\u2019d take me out so I saw it as the perfect opportunity to try have a crack at making this dish. Slipper lobster are something we don\u2019t see as much as our local eastern Rock Lobster but when you get your eye in there\u2019s plenty around. \n\nFor the lobster butter I just roasted the shells, removed the gills crushed them up then melted butter in a double boiler with the shells for 20mins, fine strain all this and your left with a super rich, iconic crustacean orange lobster butter. \n\nI wanted to do the Chawanmushi justice and I made the dashi from scratch, the katsuobushi I used gave the broth this beautiful Smokey flavour and I feel really helped to elevate the whole thing. Mixing the dashi into the eggs at a 2.5:1 ratio I added a some beautiful white shoyu (I\u2019ve found light soy/white soy is best otherwise the flavour quickly becomes overpowering), a little sake and a little mirin. Finally fine straining the custard mix to remove egg white membrane and any lumps and then steaming over some super low temp water. I steamed the slipper lobster tail in there aswell but wrapped the tail in some twine to keep it curled. After 15mins both were cooked and I carefully pulled the tail meat out and placed it ontop of the custard. I finished it by pouring some of that butter all round the top to seal the custard. I love the presentation of the dish and it\u2019s what I always had in my mind. Practically though it\u2019s pretty hard to eat like that and combine all those flavours so shredding the meat definitely works the best. Some people have suggested slicing the tail also so I might try that next time but I\u2019m not sure if it would still have the same feel.

{"title": "Little Tokyo D\u00fcsseldorf - a mini trip report", "selftext": "A couple of days ago I asked for recommendations in D\u00fcsseldorfs Little Tokyo. \n\nWe had a fun time in D\u00fcsseldorf. We arrived shortly after noon and had lunch at Kushi-tei of Tokyo, which was OK, but the service was a bit underwhelming. Most places didn't look too crowded. \n\nThe real revelation came later that evening when we had dinner at Soba-An, recommended in my topic not once, but twice. My cold soba with hot soup to dip it in had that awesome quality and taste I remember from eating in Japan; where the ingredients just click together. My kid had hot soba soup which was equally excellent, and we had tempura with it (very good!). Thank you u/RealArc and u/twilightninja for that recommendation. We were happy to have a reservation, because the place was packed, both inside and at the small outdoor seating area. We will surely eat there again when we're in the area.\n\nThen the shops. The first one we came across was Tains, which seemed fairly newly established. Large modern shop, which didn't seem much different from the large Asian supermarkets you can find at larger cities in The Netherlands (For you Dutchies: it's a lot like Amazing Oriental, only there's not many Indonesian or Surinamese products to be found), with plenty of Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai products, most from familiar producers.\n\nDae-Yang further down the road is a mixed Japanese/Korean shop with an small souvenir section, but again, food-wise, doesn't have much over the assortment that's offered in the Amsterdam/Amstelveen area back home. I did love the shop though, with its cramped paths and broader selection in brands and varieties of products.\n\nShochiku two doors down was the most Japanese of all, and there I found some products I've never seen in a shop here: fried tofu pouches to make inarizushi, a large selection of Japanese sesame oils, mirin-the-real-stuff and pickled aubergine with red shiso that I was really happy to find. I also liked the section with konbini food they have and next time we visit I'll bring a cooler to explore that some more. Both shops, but especially Shochiku also had a good selection of different kinds of rice. The price point of most products is the same as in The Netherlands.\n\nThere's only so many shops you can subject a teenager to, and all he wanted to bring home was Pocari Sweat and Pocky sticks. I would have loved to explore the non-food shops as well, but he'd been a good sport We spent the second half of the afternoon going to the large Chagall exhibition in the Kunstsammlung which, off-topic, is  highly recommended if you're in the area this summer.\n\nThe next day was May 1st, and in Germany that means that almost everything is really closed (as opposed to back home where some shops and most supermarkets are open on national holidays). But bakeries are open, and the Korean bakery was a nice place for breakfast, with its mix of traditional Korean products like fried rice balls with red bean filling and corndogs, bubble tea and slices of colourful cakes (I bought a large piece of rainbow cake to cheer up my niece who is down with mono, the poor thing). Most restaurants seemed to be opening for lunch as well.\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf is a 3-hour drive from Amsterdam on a day with normal traffic. We stopped over at the end of our holiday on our way home, and I would definitely do that again. The slightly broader selection (i.e. at Shochiku) doesn't warrant a full trip imho, but for Dutchies that live closer to the German border, I would recommend it. I know I would find the drive worthwhile :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1kcz2p4/little_tokyo_d\u00fcsseldorf_a_mini_trip_report/", "created_utc": 1746186885.0, "score": 11, "author": "yvwa", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1kcz2p4/little_tokyo_d\u00fcsseldorf_a_mini_trip_report/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The flavor, the texture, the quality. The bread is toasted just enough to keep a firm hold and keeping it crisp. The meat is unreal.

Unfortunately the \u201csalt\u201d aspect is a bit much. I thought after reading the menu that \u201csalt\u201d would just mean it\u2019s a simple seasoning. The seasoning and flavor of the pork itself is still outstanding, but they top it with giant rock salt that you don\u2019t realize until biting into it and get a giant burst of salt in each bite. At first I was confused and ate another piece before realizing what it was so I scraped off as much as I could but there was still giant salt rocks in between. So if it weren\u2019t for the salt, this would be up there with the beef filet. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcddnq", "created_utc": 1746117834.0, "score": 167, "author": "XandersOdyssey", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1kcddnq/some_of_the_best_sandwiches_from_ginza_sand/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

From there I gently simmered the pork belly, crushed/sliced ginger root and the green parts of a bundle of green onion in sake and water for two hours topped with a drop lid. Every time I went to the kitchen for water I'd skim a little of the scum and fat off the top.\n\nAfter two hours I strained the broth and reserved it for another use. Removing the green onion and ginger, I cut the strips of pork belly into cubes and returned it to the pot with dashi, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar. Specifically, I used Okinawan black sugar. Because of that I guess, technically, this is a middle ground between kakuni and the Okinawan version, rafute.\n\nI gently simmered for another two hours with the drop lid on, letting the sauce reduce around the pork belly until somewhat thick and the cubes were extremely tender. I transferred the belly and sauce to a new bowl to cool down (it's important to leave the pork belly in the sauce to cool.)\n\n  \nOnce it was cooled, I warmed it back up and served with rice, the white part of the scallion, and some homemade togarashi (I know, a little redundant, but letting it cool together improves everything significantly.)\n\nEdit: \n\nApproximate amounts\n\nPork belly - ~2lbs\n\nSake - 3/4 cup [1/4 cup in first half, 1/2 cup in second]\n\nGinger - 3 inch knob [1/2 in each half] \n\nSoy sauce - 1/4 cup\n\nMirin - 1/4 cup\n\nDashi - ~2.5 cups\n\nScallion/green onion - 5-6 [if you have Tokyo negi/Welsh onion, I'd use two.]\n\nSugar - 1/4 cup\n\nWhen reducing the sauce, keep an eye on it, especially during the last hour or so.

One the liquid starts heating up, I remove the kombu, and once boiling I add the katsuobushi shavings and kill the heat.

I dunno how much, but a semi small amount of cubed silken tofu to the dashi. I bring to a light boil, at which point I take out a ladle of the dashi and add to 35g of white miso paste, whisk to combine, and keep that aside while the soup very lightly simmers till I'm ready to serve. To serve, I kill the heat, add the miso slurry, then serve immediately.\n\nNatto rice: thaw natto pack overnight.

Transparency aside (maybe it's me but it seems pretty cool to me in the end) I was able to work the \"dough\" to enclose the filling and it got the mochi texture that I know and love... It was not possible to work the dough with a rice dough made with the rice that I can access in Italy and the texture with non sticky rice is just wrong.\n\nSince it was already not traditional for the filling I decided to blend some almond with sugar and make a \"dough\" with the help of some honey. For the final dust I used potato starch. To make the second one green I replaced a little bit of sugar with mint syrup and the result was really tasty.\n\nI have to say that I'm not sure this can be posted here. I think it's mochi but it is not traditional for sure.

I'm not even sure that's the right amount) and I covered the result in a layer of rice starch and... I think it was the right consistency and the right texture and the right flavor... but it's been years since I tasted mochi so I'm not really sure.\n\nThe only thing that made me turn up my nose is the fact that rice starch does not remain white but becomes transparent, but it is also true that mochi are often colored and in any case covered with a layer of starch. It was certainly workable and stretchable as in the videos I saw regarding the use of glutinous rice flour. \n\nHas anyone ever tried it? \n\nIf so, do you think it is a valid alternative or do you think I am wrong and that the texture is actually very different? \n\nKeep in mind that rice starch is very easy to find for me so even if it were not a perfect substitute I would still be happy with it but if you think there are better options that I could have access to in Italy let me know (I do not have access to tapioca flour). \n\nObviously if you think that rice starch is completely wrong let me know in that case too.\n\nI tried to do an online search but I didn't find any information about it (is rice starch something common only in Italy?

{"title": "Ichigo Sando", "selftext": "Ichigo Sando (Strawberry Sandwich) is a beloved snack that's especially popular during strawberry season in Japan (December through March). It's made with soft Japanese milk bread (shokupan), lightly sweetened whipped cream, and fresh strawberries carefully arranged to create a beautiful cross-section when sliced. Here's how I make mine:\n\n* Using high-butterfat cream whipped with sweetened condensed milk gives the filling its distinctive rich flavor and velvety texture.\n* A thin layer of strawberry jam on each slice of bread intensifies the strawberry flavor while balancing out the salt in the bread.\u00a0\n* Chilling the assembled sandwich briefly before slicing sets its shapes so it doesn't fall apart when you eat it.\n\nIt's one of those quick snacks you can throw together in a few minutes, but it tastes like Japan.

{"title": "Mystery sauce/condiment", "selftext": "I would love some help tracking down what I believe is a Japanese condiment or sauce that I bought a few years ago that I cannot find. i'm not absolutely sure it's Japanese, but I \\*think\\* it is because the packaging is that classic soft squeeze bottle I virtually only see used by Japanese manufacturers. The package looks like sort of a small (250g) bottle of Kewpie mayo or neri ume paste (see Kinjirushi's packaging attached), but the top was a simple finely tapered tip with a loose cap (not attached), not a wide flip/click cap like most others. The cap was made of white plastic. It has the same label style as Kinjirushi's neri ume paste because I remember the entire label came off on accident when I opened it, leaving a blank plastic bottle. The bottle opening is *tiny*, giving a stream the width of a spaghetto.\n\nAs far as the sauce/paste, it's a red sauce, about the same look as ketchup in terms of color, and tastes kind of somewhere between a ketchup and okonomi sauce, being probably based in the sugar/tomato/vinegar combo family. It's thick, almost as thick as some gochujang, but very smooth like a very thick ketchup. I've been to all of the Asian food stores I would have bought it from and none of them seem to have it in the packaging I remember.\n\nI *crave* it and yet I must have tossed the bottle a while back. I bought it thinking it was something else, so I haven't a clue what it was.\n\nThank you in advance for any help!\n\n[The closest packaging I can find, but different cap.](https://preview.redd.it/ato6rphwa5qe1.jpg?width=730&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bfb825e889980c8c062f7890d402d51f1e13e0f)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jgx0j0/mystery_saucecondiment/", "created_utc": 1742606371.0, "score": 1, "author": "ZeahLessley", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jgx0j0/mystery_saucecondiment/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Coco Ichibanya Garlic", "selftext": "Most of us know the beloved Coco Ichibanya. In 2023 I ordered garlic with my curry and had an epiphany. This stuff elevated the curry so much, I went on a quest to find a way to make it at home. \n\nI didn't find a recipe online and the only thing I could find was an old Reddit thread in this sub of someone asking for the recipe to no avail. \n\nThen I took to ChatGPT to find me the recipe and it delivered. I tried it, made some adjustments and ended up with a pretty close if not almost  identical approximation. \n\nFor all the garlic lovers, here's the recipe:\n\n\u2022 8 garlic bulbs\n\u2022 rapeseed oil\n\u2022 4 tsp chili oil\n\u2022 4 tsp gochujang\n\u2022 4 tbsp sesame oil\n\u2022 6 tbsp soy sauce\n\u2022 4 tbsp mirin\n\u2022 1 tbsp sugar\n\u2022 1 tbsp black Chinese vinegar (optional if sweetness needs to be balanced out)\n\n1. Peel the garlic cloves.\n\n\n2. Heat the cooking oil in a pot (just enough so it covers the cloves) to frying temperature.\n\n\n3. Fry the garlic on medium to high heat for 30 seconds, then continue on low to medium until the garlic is soft (test with a fork or skewer). Drain the garlic, keep the oil, as it's killer garlic oil.\n\n\n4. Mix chili oil, gochujang, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar in a pan or pot (I used a wok) and add vinegar if necessary. Adjust flavor to your liking (more salt? Add soy sauce! More sweetness? Add sugar! Too sweet? Add vinegar and maybe soy sauce!).\n\n\n5. When the sauce is heated, add the garlic and let it simmer until the sauce thickens.\n\n\n6. Put in a jar and store in fridge.\n\n\n\nYou can probably experiment a bit with the right amount of sugar. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jetppg", "created_utc": 1742379472.0, "score": 20, "author": "knightriderin", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jetppg/coco_ichibanya_garlic/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Japan domestic market rice cooker vs. made for export cooker", "selftext": "Japanese rice is one of our staple meal ingredients. The rice cooker in our kitchen is used almost daily.\n\nI recently visited Japan after a long absence. It\u2019s been around 15 years since I bought my last rice cooker there, a 1-litre IH type Zojirushi which still works well but the pot is scratched and I don\u2019t like the idea of consuming the coating a little bit at a time.\n\nI decided it would be a good idea to get another cooker and keep the old one as a backup or give it to someone else. \n\nWhile visiting recently I saw plenty of options for those who live in Europe (where I currently live) where the voltage is 200 to 220. However, the pots were thin and light and the cookers were not as \u201cfeature-full\u201d (they had fewer options/features). \n\nI decided to buy a JP domestic model and I do not regret it. I have a transformer which I have been using with the old cooker for a number of years. In fact the old cooker was also used in Canada for about ten years where the voltage is 110 to 120 at 60Hz. It was completely fine. \n\nSo for those who might think that they should buy the made-for-export models, I suggest you\u2019ll have a longer lasting cooker if you get a not-for-export model. Just know that your warranty is not extended outside of Japan and your transformer\u2019s power spec should be more than the wattage of the cooker. In my case my transformer is rated at 1500W and my cooker is only consuming around 1100W. \n\nDoes anyone have any other tips?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/mid5qmo66ope1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742400138.0, "score": 3, "author": "Content-Wolverine135", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jf0g4l/japan_domestic_market_rice_cooker_vs_made_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Little Tokyo D\u00fcsseldorf - a mini trip report", "selftext": "A couple of days ago I asked for recommendations in D\u00fcsseldorfs Little Tokyo. \n\nWe had a fun time in D\u00fcsseldorf. We arrived shortly after noon and had lunch at Kushi-tei of Tokyo, which was OK, but the service was a bit underwhelming. Most places didn't look too crowded. \n\nThe real revelation came later that evening when we had dinner at Soba-An, recommended in my topic not once, but twice. My cold soba with hot soup to dip it in had that awesome quality and taste I remember from eating in Japan; where the ingredients just click together. My kid had hot soba soup which was equally excellent, and we had tempura with it (very good!). Thank you u/RealArc and u/twilightninja for that recommendation. We were happy to have a reservation, because the place was packed, both inside and at the small outdoor seating area. We will surely eat there again when we're in the area.\n\nThen the shops. The first one we came across was Tains, which seemed fairly newly established. Large modern shop, which didn't seem much different from the large Asian supermarkets you can find at larger cities in The Netherlands (For you Dutchies: it's a lot like Amazing Oriental, only there's not many Indonesian or Surinamese products to be found), with plenty of Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai products, most from familiar producers.\n\nDae-Yang further down the road is a mixed Japanese/Korean shop with an small souvenir section, but again, food-wise, doesn't have much over the assortment that's offered in the Amsterdam/Amstelveen area back home. I did love the shop though, with its cramped paths and broader selection in brands and varieties of products.\n\nShochiku two doors down was the most Japanese of all, and there I found some products I've never seen in a shop here: fried tofu pouches to make inarizushi, a large selection of Japanese sesame oils, mirin-the-real-stuff and pickled aubergine with red shiso that I was really happy to find. I also liked the section with konbini food they have and next time we visit I'll bring a cooler to explore that some more. Both shops, but especially Shochiku also had a good selection of different kinds of rice. The price point of most products is the same as in The Netherlands.\n\nThere's only so many shops you can subject a teenager to, and all he wanted to bring home was Pocari Sweat and Pocky sticks. I would have loved to explore the non-food shops as well, but he'd been a good sport We spent the second half of the afternoon going to the large Chagall exhibition in the Kunstsammlung which, off-topic, is  highly recommended if you're in the area this summer.\n\nThe next day was May 1st, and in Germany that means that almost everything is really closed (as opposed to back home where some shops and most supermarkets are open on national holidays). But bakeries are open, and the Korean bakery was a nice place for breakfast, with its mix of traditional Korean products like fried rice balls with red bean filling and corndogs, bubble tea and slices of colourful cakes (I bought a large piece of rainbow cake to cheer up my niece who is down with mono, the poor thing). Most restaurants seemed to be opening for lunch as well.\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf is a 3-hour drive from Amsterdam on a day with normal traffic. We stopped over at the end of our holiday on our way home, and I would definitely do that again. The slightly broader selection (i.e. at Shochiku) doesn't warrant a full trip imho, but for Dutchies that live closer to the German border, I would recommend it. I know I would find the drive worthwhile :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1kcz2p4/little_tokyo_d\u00fcsseldorf_a_mini_trip_report/", "created_utc": 1746186885.0, "score": 11, "author": "yvwa", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1kcz2p4/little_tokyo_d\u00fcsseldorf_a_mini_trip_report/", "html_title": ""}

The seasoning and flavor of the pork itself is still outstanding, but they top it with giant rock salt that you don\u2019t realize until biting into it and get a giant burst of salt in each bite. At first I was confused and ate another piece before realizing what it was so I scraped off as much as I could but there was still giant salt rocks in between.

From there I gently simmered the pork belly, crushed/sliced ginger root and the green parts of a bundle of green onion in sake and water for two hours topped with a drop lid. Every time I went to the kitchen for water I'd skim a little of the scum and fat off the top.\n\nAfter two hours I strained the broth and reserved it for another use. Removing the green onion and ginger, I cut the strips of pork belly into cubes and returned it to the pot with dashi, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar. Specifically, I used Okinawan black sugar. Because of that I guess, technically, this is a middle ground between kakuni and the Okinawan version, rafute.\n\nI gently simmered for another two hours with the drop lid on, letting the sauce reduce around the pork belly until somewhat thick and the cubes were extremely tender. I transferred the belly and sauce to a new bowl to cool down (it's important to leave the pork belly in the sauce to cool.)\n\n  \nOnce it was cooled, I warmed it back up and served with rice, the white part of the scallion, and some homemade togarashi (I know, a little redundant, but letting it cool together improves everything significantly.)\n\nEdit: \n\nApproximate amounts\n\nPork belly - ~2lbs\n\nSake - 3/4 cup [1/4 cup in first half, 1/2 cup in second]\n\nGinger - 3 inch knob [1/2 in each half] \n\nSoy sauce - 1/4 cup\n\nMirin - 1/4 cup\n\nDashi - ~2.5 cups\n\nScallion/green onion - 5-6 [if you have Tokyo negi/Welsh onion, I'd use two.]\n\nSugar - 1/4 cup\n\nWhen reducing the sauce, keep an eye on it, especially during the last hour or so. It can go from perfect to burned pretty quickly in the last bit.

We\u2019ve been to many Japanese restaurants in our country, but of course, they\u2019re pretty westernized. That makes it hard to know what the real experience will be like.\n\nIt\u2019s always a bit complicated for me because I\u2019m very limited when it comes to food. The main issue is that I don\u2019t eat fish, seafood, or nori (seaweed).\n\nThis makes it kind of tricky to figure out what I\u2019d be able to eat in Japan that isn\u2019t just fast food. We\u2019re hoping there are still some traditional dishes that don\u2019t include those ingredients, or maybe I could ask for something like removing the nori. But I worry that doing that might be considered disrespectful, especially with how important tradition is in Japan\u2014and I absolutely don\u2019t want to offend anyone.\n\nSo my request is: could you recommend any traditional Japanese dishes that don\u2019t include fish, seafood, or nori?

Transparency aside (maybe it's me but it seems pretty cool to me in the end) I was able to work the \"dough\" to enclose the filling and it got the mochi texture that I know and love... It was not possible to work the dough with a rice dough made with the rice that I can access in Italy and the texture with non sticky rice is just wrong.\n\nSince it was already not traditional for the filling I decided to blend some almond with sugar and make a \"dough\" with the help of some honey. For the final dust I used potato starch. To make the second one green I replaced a little bit of sugar with mint syrup and the result was really tasty.\n\nI have to say that I'm not sure this can be posted here. I think it's mochi but it is not traditional for sure. I decided to try to post it anyway because another user [winkers](https://www.reddit.com/user/winkers/) in my question above asked to see the final result of my experiment. I hope nobody will be offended by this but if you need to remove it I understand.\n\nI used a ratio of 2 part water:1 part rice starch:0.5 part sugar\n\nWhen I replaced part of the sugar with mint syrup I did not measure it, it was just a drop about 5g.\n\nMixed everything, microwaved it for about 1 minute and every 20 second I mixed.\n\nFor the filling I used 50g of almonds with skin still on, 20g of sugar and about a spoon of honey.\n\nMixed and got two balls of filling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjvtlo", "created_utc": 1742940405.0, "score": 50, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jjvtlo/i_tried_making_mochi_with_rice_starch_not/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Can I use rice starch to make mochi?", "selftext": "I've been looking for mochiko flour or glutinous rice flour for a while now but they're simply not available in my area and buying them online would mean paying a very high shipping cost and a very high cost for a generic product that I don't even know if it's any good. \n\nIn the past I tried with regular rice flour (I had followed a recipe that simply asked for rice flour without specifying that a specific rice flour was needed) but it has a totally different consistency from mochi and I immediately understood that it wasn't the right way (an online search confirmed my suspicion). \n\nA few months ago I got rice starch to create yudane to add to my pandoro recipe (in modern recipes it is used to improve the result) and tonight I had an enlightenment: use rice starch to make mochi.\n\nI just tried to microwave it with water and sugar (10g of rice starch, 20g of water, 10g of sugar... I'm not even sure that's the right amount) and I covered the result in a layer of rice starch and... I think it was the right consistency and the right texture and the right flavor... but it's been years since I tasted mochi so I'm not really sure.\n\nThe only thing that made me turn up my nose is the fact that rice starch does not remain white but becomes transparent, but it is also true that mochi are often colored and in any case covered with a layer of starch. It was certainly workable and stretchable as in the videos I saw regarding the use of glutinous rice flour. \n\nHas anyone ever tried it? \n\nIf so, do you think it is a valid alternative or do you think I am wrong and that the texture is actually very different? \n\nKeep in mind that rice starch is very easy to find for me so even if it were not a perfect substitute I would still be happy with it but if you think there are better options that I could have access to in Italy let me know (I do not have access to tapioca flour). \n\nObviously if you think that rice starch is completely wrong let me know in that case too.\n\nI tried to do an online search but I didn't find any information about it (is rice starch something common only in Italy? Or is it called something else elsewhere? I really can't understand why no one has tried this method).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jj4e7l/can_i_use_rice_starch_to_make_mochi/", "created_utc": 1742856431.0, "score": 1, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jj4e7l/can_i_use_rice_starch_to_make_mochi/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It has the same label style as Kinjirushi's neri ume paste because I remember the entire label came off on accident when I opened it, leaving a blank plastic bottle. The bottle opening is *tiny*, giving a stream the width of a spaghetto.\n\nAs far as the sauce/paste, it's a red sauce, about the same look as ketchup in terms of color, and tastes kind of somewhere between a ketchup and okonomi sauce, being probably based in the sugar/tomato/vinegar combo family.

But as any curry vet will tell you, that's just the absolute starting line for Japanese curry.\n\nFor example, CoCo Ichibanya's secret recipe is said to include a blend of different vegetables, fatty pork, and coffee sauteed and blended into a demiglaze to be mixed with the roux and spices.\n\nMy typical style is to use a box mix with plenty of grated garlic, ketchup (I usually use Heinz), worcestershire (Western style), hondashi or chicken broth, soy sauce for saltiness, and chu-no or tonkatsu sauce for fruit flavors and body.\n\nAnyone else have something they use to spin on curry?

{"title": "Japan domestic market rice cooker vs. made for export cooker", "selftext": "Japanese rice is one of our staple meal ingredients. The rice cooker in our kitchen is used almost daily.\n\nI recently visited Japan after a long absence. It\u2019s been around 15 years since I bought my last rice cooker there, a 1-litre IH type Zojirushi which still works well but the pot is scratched and I don\u2019t like the idea of consuming the coating a little bit at a time.\n\nI decided it would be a good idea to get another cooker and keep the old one as a backup or give it to someone else. \n\nWhile visiting recently I saw plenty of options for those who live in Europe (where I currently live) where the voltage is 200 to 220. However, the pots were thin and light and the cookers were not as \u201cfeature-full\u201d (they had fewer options/features). \n\nI decided to buy a JP domestic model and I do not regret it. I have a transformer which I have been using with the old cooker for a number of years. In fact the old cooker was also used in Canada for about ten years where the voltage is 110 to 120 at 60Hz. It was completely fine. \n\nSo for those who might think that they should buy the made-for-export models, I suggest you\u2019ll have a longer lasting cooker if you get a not-for-export model. Just know that your warranty is not extended outside of Japan and your transformer\u2019s power spec should be more than the wattage of the cooker. In my case my transformer is rated at 1500W and my cooker is only consuming around 1100W. \n\nDoes anyone have any other tips?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/mid5qmo66ope1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742400138.0, "score": 4, "author": "Content-Wolverine135", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jf0g4l/japan_domestic_market_rice_cooker_vs_made_for/", "html_title": ""}

I tried it, made some adjustments and ended up with a pretty close if not almost  identical approximation. \n\nFor all the garlic lovers, here's the recipe:\n\n\u2022 8 garlic bulbs\n\u2022 rapeseed oil\n\u2022 4 tsp chili oil\n\u2022 4 tsp gochujang\n\u2022 4 tbsp sesame oil\n\u2022 6 tbsp soy sauce\n\u2022 4 tbsp mirin\n\u2022 1 tbsp sugar\n\u2022 1 tbsp black Chinese vinegar (optional if sweetness needs to be balanced out)\n\n1. Peel the garlic cloves.\n\n\n2. Heat the cooking oil in a pot (just enough so it covers the cloves) to frying temperature.\n\n\n3. Fry the garlic on medium to high heat for 30 seconds, then continue on low to medium until the garlic is soft (test with a fork or skewer). Drain the garlic, keep the oil, as it's killer garlic oil.\n\n\n4. Mix chili oil, gochujang, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar in a pan or pot (I used a wok) and add vinegar if necessary. Adjust flavor to your liking (more salt? Add soy sauce! More sweetness? Add sugar! Too sweet? Add vinegar and maybe soy sauce!).\n\n\n5. When the sauce is heated, add the garlic and let it simmer until the sauce thickens.\n\n\n6. Put in a jar and store in fridge.\n\n\n\nYou can probably experiment a bit with the right amount of sugar. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jetppg", "created_utc": 1742379472.0, "score": 20, "author": "knightriderin", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jetppg/coco_ichibanya_garlic/", "html_title": ""}
