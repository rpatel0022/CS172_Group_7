{"title": "Flavor of My Generation", "selftext": "I\u2019m a southern boy that grew into a southern man with the nourishment of grease rendered from freshly butchered hogs and fertile red dirt, not eaten but ground into me from the outside.  I\u2019ll never grace an Armani ad or even look forward to a day of sunbathing at the beach shirtless. I have truly loved a life raised on the promise of Sunday peach cobbler and mason jars forever topped off with sweet tea. My aunts made casseroles and dressings in baking dishes the size of a pickup truck beds.  Our noses constantly absorbed the aromas as we watched from underneath the porch, hoping to wait out the diamondback rattlesnake rumored to live in the rose bush our baseball was last seen bounding into. We glistened with the sheen of sweat that arrives early spring and stays late into the endless August summer. We would rise early and stuff our bellies on blueberry or crabapple jelly piled high on biscuits so fluffy they certainly were plucked from the clouds ahead of the summer thundershowers that always sent us scurrying for the closest front porch. Those were the days spent stressfully focused on catching frogs from mud hole out past the pecan trees, long long before the responsibilities of adulthood. Powered by those southern delicacies, we had the fuel to carry us to sundown, where the darkness limited us to telling stories and lies underneath the canopy of my grandmothers porch. \n\nI have been fortunate as an adult to be able to travel and taste a lot of corners of our great country and world. I have eaten a 30$ pimento cheese sandwich with a 4$ pickle in California and BBQ from an oven promised to be genuinely southern in Denver CO. As tasty as their food may have been, it\u2019s always left my pallet longing for the cuisine of my youth, and the accompanying stories from my uncle\u2019s that were never hindered by truth. \n\nI know not everyone is blessed to be from the south, but your life will always benefit cherishing the geography and flavor of your generations youth. \n\nJD", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/qkio9g/flavor_of_my_generation/", "created_utc": 1635786740.0, "score": 7, "author": "jtd1437", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/qkio9g/flavor_of_my_generation/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I wrote a guide to the food and food-culture in Switzerland.", "selftext": "\n------------------------------\n\n\nNot all of these are truly Swiss, but what isn\u2019t unique is very dominant at least in Switzerland. [Wikipedia has a good list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cuisine). Mostly the food is fairly normal by western standards. However veal is very common here, as is horse (my town even has a specialist butcher for horse meat) which will not be to everyone\u2019s ethical taste.\n\nThis post is also going to be far from complete. There are endless little variations on cured meats, breads, and cheese all over the country. And I will probably have missed a few big things too. And as with all my posts is going to be heavily biased towards the German speaking region (which itself makes things confusing by having different names/spelling in every town).\n\nFor more info\n\n* **[Helvetic Kitchen](https://www.helvetickitchen.com/)** the website, also in [book form](https://www.bergli.ch/collections/all/products/helvetic-kitchen).\n\n* **[Tiptopf](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiptopf)** (playing on Tip-Top which the Swiss use surprisingly often and think of as their own) is the basic Swiss cooking bible, though only in German as far as I know.\n\n* **[Patrimoine culinaire](http://www.patrimoineculinaire.ch/)**, though it is also language limited.\n\nGenerally it isn\u2019t hard to find a local dish, or a local version of a product. Walking around a Coop or Migros supermarket will make it obvious what is local. You can often buy cheese, meat, eggs, honey and other products direct from farms which have an honesty box (or sometimes even a vending machine) outside the farmhouse or by a walking path. The local market (Saturday morning, and maybe also during the week) is a safe bet too.\n\nWith thanks to /r/askswitzerland for [their feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/) to me, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/e01f0fb/) especially deserves to be recognised.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Cheese**\n\nThere are something along the lines of 450 different cheeses, and various dishes made using them. You could (and somebody probably has) write a gigantic book on this.\n\nThere are various groups and often rules like what altitude the cows must have been and what they have eaten. A few types you commonly see are Mutschli, Hobel (German for plane). Sbrinz is a hard cheese that is like the Swiss Parmesan.\n\nThe [Swiss Cheese Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Cheese_Union) were like a sinister cheesy mafia who controlled what was made and pushed Fondue and Raclette into the national dishes they are today. Though they were apparently responsible for [this amazing sponsored ski uniform](https://i.imgur.com/vsKscqP.jpg) which is wonderful enough to forgive them for everything.\n\nEmmentaler, Gruyere and Appenzeller are the big 3 cheese types that you will find in every shop in Switzerland. \n\n* **Emmental**, or if it is in the actual region protected form Emmentaler Switzerland (non-protected may well come from France, Germany or a range of other places), is the classic hole filled \u201cSwiss Cheese\u201d of cartoons. The mild and normal versions are a bit bland, but the strong has a good flavour to it.\n\n* **Gruyere** from the touristy village of the same name. A classic choice for melting.\n\n* **Appenzeller** is the least well known of the three (outside of Switzerland anyway) and I think the most interesting by far. Be sure to try some. [They also have the best adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZNqXJAaGo).\n\nBeyond these there are endless cheeses that are found in each area and time of year.\n\nThen there are of course the famous cheese based meals\u2026.\n\n* **Fondue** is one of the classic dishes associated with Switzerland, and most Swiss people do own a set. Best eaten in cold weather, with wine or black tea on the side. Remember not to lose your bread in the pot or let your mouth touch the fork. An interesting (especially to watch) variation on this is **Ch\u00e4sb\u00e4ngel** which is basically a fondue filled baguette that I have only seen at Basel Herbstmesse, trying to eat it without causing an eruption of liquid cheese is something of a challenge.\n\n* **Raclette**. This tends to be less well known than Fondue, but works much better during summer. Traditionally it should be a fat slab of cheese where you keep scraping the melted top off, however for practical reasons it is most commonly seen as thin slices that you put under a mini grill.\n\n* **Ch\u00e4sw\u00e4ie / K\u00e4sew\u00e4he** more of a snack than a full meal. A savoury cheese pie that can be found in most cafes and bakeries.\n\n* **La Bo\u00eete Chaude** comes from the Jura and is far less known than Fondue or Raclette and is unsurprisingly rather rare to come across. Basically a oven baked cheese dish.\n\n* **Ch\u00e4sschnitte** is sort of prepared like French toast, but with a more Welsh Rarebit like savoury nature. [Apparently it is a big part of Swiss-army life](https://www.helvetickitchen.com/recipes/2015/9/29/militarkaseschnitten)\n\nThere are also a few show dairies about where you can see it being made like Gruyere or Emmental amongst others (anywhere touristy will probably have one somewhere around it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Chocolate**\n\nUnsurprisingly the options here are also pretty extensive.\n\nAt the top (expensive) end you have local specialised chocolate shops. This will almost always be the best option (but not the cheapest). The most famous (make your own mind up on best or not) is [Spr\u00fcngli](https://www.spruengli.ch/cms/en/) in Z\u00fcrich which has expanded so much that they have their own factory elsewhere now and chain stores in various other places (even in Dubai) - but every city/town will have at least one independent special shop, many of which double as cafes (Eg: [Hofer in Solothurn](https://www.confiseriehofer.ch/), or [Walder in Neuchatel](http://walder-confiserie.ch/)). Just to make the point [here is an article about the endless options in Z\u00fcrich](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/01/zurich-switzerland-chocolate-capital-city-break).\n\nThe 2nd fanciest option is the [L\u00e4derach chain of shops](https://www.laederach.com/shop/en/full-catalog.html) which can be found just about anywhere with tourists and/or more than 10,000 inhabitants. They are high quality and most notable for the gigantic slabs of chocolate in the windows. At the one in Bern you can book to do a chocolate workshop.\n\nIf you just want to buy a standard chocolate brand then supermarkets will be the cheapest option. They offer a big range of chocolate in just about any location, and in tourist areas the chocolate section tends to be massive.\n\nFrey, Cailler, and Ragusa are the most interesting options that are hard to find outside of the country. There is of course Lindt and Toblerone, but they are so common the world over that I wouldn\u2019t bother myself with buying them in Switzerland. \n\nKagi Fret is slightly more biscuit than chocolate but is one of the truly Swiss brands that most outsiders wouldn\u2019t know about.\n\nThe Branche praline/nut bars (Cailler are the best option, Coop do their own cheaper brand)  are very Swiss too.\n\nOne interesting choice of chocolates are Katzenzungen (cat\u2019s tongues). [The box design from the type sold at Coop is wonderfully odd.](https://i.imgur.com/PMc59Tj.jpg) Though they are not truly Swiss.\n\nAt Easter the shops fill up with ranks of chocolate hares who stare at you with manic smiles, which are probably meant to be cute - but to me [look like evil murder-bunnies](https://i.imgur.com/Bus3Al8.jpg).\n\n\nYou can visit the Cailler chocolate factory [my post on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/82yi34/gruy%C3%A8res_switzerland_on_a_snowy_sunday_in_march/), or the [Alprose museum](http://www.alprose.ch/museum/) which is in the arse-end of nowhere. There is also the Villars factory in Fribourg, which you can\u2019t tour but you can buy discount rejects from. And the [Ragusa factory in the Jura too\u2026](https://chezcamillebloch.swiss/en/)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Breakfast / Zn\u00fcni**\n\nZn\u00fcni (literally meaning 9am) is the slightly earlier version of elevenses. It might be a pile of bread-rolls and gipfeli (croissants) or it might be loafs of bread with jam, cheese, and meat. Either way it is the go to choice for how to celebrate your birthday or other occasions at work.\n\n* One very traditional breakfast or Zn\u00fcni is to get a bread-roll and stuff a branche chocolate into it. Like a DIY Pain au chocolat.\n\n* **M\u00fcsli and Bircherm\u00fcsli**. One of the few Swiss-German words to enter the English language.\n\n* **Butterz\u00f6pf** is a plaited bread that is the traditional go-to for Sunday morning breakfast (or any breakfast) \n\n* Croissants are called Gipfeli (little peaks). The Nussgipfel is a rather good option. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Meat**\n\n\n* **Cervelat** a beef/pork sausage. This is a key part of Swiss culture. To be truly Swiss you must go hiking with a pack of these and roast them over a little fire (having first cut the ends in a cross shape). The experience will be far more memorable than the flavour though it must be said.\n\n* **Bratwurst and brot** can be found almost anywhere as an easy fast food option. Oddly the bread is literally a chunk of bread - it has no resemblance to the shape of the Wurst so you have to alternate bites between each. This can make eating it and holding a drink something of a balancing act. Whether or not you have mustard with it is something of a regional rule - leading to the Senfgraben.\n\n\n**Dried meats**\n\nEvery little region has its own special ham or similar type of cured or dried meat. You can normally get a plate of mixed dried meats and cheeses at restaurants. [I refer you to this comment for more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/e01f0fb/).\n\n* **B\u00fcndnerfleisch** is one of the most common Swiss meats. [It also led to one of the most memorable incidents in Swiss politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBeLCDTPs8o).  \n\n* **Appenzeller Mostbr\u00f6ckli** is another favourite\n\n* **Landj\u00e4ger** is a stick of dried meat. Not purely Swiss, but very common here. [Though the Germans seem to see it as rather more romantic](https://i.imgur.com/fgVGVCX.jpg).\n\nBut again there are endless more around the country like: the thick **Saucisson** from the Romandie, \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ap\u00e9ro**\n\nThe Swiss really bloody love an Ap\u00e9ro. There is no better way to end the day, have an event, or just do whatever, than with a few drinks and light snacks.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Meals**\n\nA key part of lunchtime in Switzerland is saying [\u201cEn Guete\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSghY18nQhw&list=PLx3utklxhn0Ivr3BzcaN8TxXcld5Plkj5&index=21) (basically \u201cbon appetit\u201d) to everybody you see doing anything between 11:30 and 13:30.\n\nOne thing that surprised me is how much the Swiss utterly love to BBQ and regard summer as grill-season. The ownership and enthusiasm to break out the grill puts even the Aussies to shame. Starting a little fire in the countryside to cook something is always popular - you see makeshift fire pits everywhere.\n\n* **Salad**. Having a salad before a meal is downright essential. Usually it is a not very exciting green or mixed salad - but the Swiss utterly must eat one before a meal. Probably the most interesting salad option is **N\u00fcsslisalat**. Wurst-Salat is common too, but I consider that more German.\n\n* **Soup** is also pretty common before (or as) a meal. **B\u00fcndner Gerstensuppe** is one of the very Swiss options, though most areas have their own special types like Soledurner Wys\u00fcppli, or the Mehlsuppe served at Basel Fasnacht.\n\n* **Regional platters**. Berner Platte, Appenzeller platte, etc:. Slices of cold meats, cheese, and some veg (or at least a gherkin). \n\n* **\u00c4lplermagronen** kind of like macaroni cheese, often served with apple sauce.\n\n* **R\u00f6sti** is the classic Swiss-German meal. So much so that the language divide between the French and German parts is called the R\u00f6stigraben. Basically it is a big hashbrown. \n\n* **Pastetli / Vol-au-vent** is kind of like an open topped pie made with puff-pastry. Usually a soft crust with a creamy mix of meat and mushrooms inside.\n\n* **Z\u00fcrcher Geschnetzeltes**\n\n* **Le papet Vaudois**\n\n* **Fleischvogel** (literally translates as meat-bird). Technically the German Rouladen, but the name makes them stand out - not least as there is no bird in it normally.\n\n* **Cordon Bleu**. Basically a schnitzel. Take a large bit of pig/veal, hit it until it is thin and tender, combine with cheese and ham, cover in breadcrumbs and fry. Tasty, hearty, and most of your days calories in one easy go.\n\n* **Mountain/lake fish** they might be far from the sea but it is easy to spot big trout and other fish in the lakes and rivers.\n\n* The Swiss-Germans go as crazy as the Germans for asparagus in the springtime. Expect it to dominate the menus then.\n\n* Less well known, but in autumn rich venison and other game dishes appear on menus and are a perfect fit for the season\n\n* **Aromat** is an MSG based condiment found on most tables.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Dessert**\n\nThere are various staples\n\n* **Fruit W\u00e4he** a flan type cake with fruit on top. Easy and found all over.\n\n* **Vermicelle**. Basically spaghetti like worms made from pureed and sweetened chestnut. Usually served with cream, and sometimes schnapps too. Especially common in autumn and my favourite dessert option.\n\n* **Meringue**. Supposedly coming from the town of Meiringen. Which is also noted as the death site of Sherlock Holmes. You can combine both into one and get a Meringue with Sherlock Holmes on it. The french speaking town of Gruyeres does a thick double cream with Meringue dish (and it is one the best attempts outside of the UK of proper thick cream).\n\nThere are also various regional cakes:\n\n* **B\u00fcndner Nusstorte** is the classic. Very rich so you only need abit, but it lasts well so no rush with it.\n\n* **Birnbrot** is a pair based pastry. Slightly towards a mince pie in theory, but a different taste and texture. \n\n* **Zuger Kirschtorte** is fairly famous, though I have yet to try it.\n\nAnd the list just keeps on going\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nDrinks\n\n* **Rivella** is basically the Swiss national soft drink - like Iron Bru is to the Scots. The taste isn\u2019t especially good or bad. What does make it memorable is that is is made with milk serum (though you would never know that from the taste or look).\n\n* **Tea**. You get various alpine herbal types, including in some places Edelweis which is quite good. (Needless to say you can\u2019t get a proper British tea)\n\n* **Coffee** tends to be quite small (despite the high price) and cappuccino is often something of a disappointment. \u201cHaus\u201d or \u201cSpecial\u201d coffee means with enough schnapps to knock out a small animal. \u201cKafi Lutz\u201d is a popular choice during Fasnacht.\n\nFor alcoholic drinks saying cheers (or prost as it is) is a somewhat tedious affair as you have to clink the glass of every single person whilst looking them in the eye and saying their name. I rather miss the quick and easy British way of saying cheers, waving your glass in the air for a second, then drinking.\n\n* **Beer**. There are an amazing number of breweries from national to local level - [the one-man website Bov.ch is trying to visit and review all of them](https://www.bov.ch/beer/index-Y.html). Feldschlossen is the mass produced default beer that is everywhere. Better than the default lagers in the UK, but still best avoided for something more interesting and local if possible. Finding a more local beer in bars or the supermarkets won\u2019t be a problem. If you are on a tight budget then Coop lager is 50 cents a can (no idea how it tastes myself though).\n\n* **Wine**. The Swiss make surprising quantities of wine in just about every region of the country, most of which is drunk domestically so you rarely see it abroad. It is generally more expensive than imported wines but is also generally good quality (or at least it is now, apparently it was awful 20 years ago when wine imports were limited and there was no real competition). \n\n* **Whisky**. The Swiss do make some surprisingly good (to my taste) whisky. S\u00e4ntis malt is the most common option.\n\n* **Schnapps**. Various local varieties, not a big fan myself.\n\n* **Appenzeller Alpenbitter**. Not a fan myself but it is rather popular.\n\n* **Absinthe**. Invented, banned and then re-legalised in Switzerland. The beautiful and rather forgotten Val de Travers in Neuchatel is the place to go for this. The train station at Noirague is well stocked with the stuff and is a starting point for a hike in the beautiful Aruse gorge or the Cru De Van. Further up the valley you can visit dedicated bars and distillers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Misc sweets/bits:**\n\n* **Kambly** little biscuits from the Emmental region.\n\n* **Biberli**. A slightly marzipan like cake from the Appenzell region. The little packets you find in supermarkets are great for taking on your travels. Though the proper stuff from a bakers is rather different - and much better really (if less practical).\n\n* **Ricola** the classic sweet with [the classic adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAoDzIsx03E). Interestingly they are a very ethical company and fund various types of research.\n\n* **Heiss maroni**. Not uniquely Swiss, but so super-common during the colder months that it is a real part of Swiss culture in winter..\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/8ojvpa/i_wrote_a_guide_to_the_food_and_foodculture_in/", "created_utc": 1528138742.0, "score": 3, "author": "travel_ali", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/8ojvpa/i_wrote_a_guide_to_the_food_and_foodculture_in/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The Theory of 'Pumpkin Spice' Everything.", "selftext": "Fall brings many things that people love: cooler weather, brightly colored leaves, cozy sweaters and the now ubiquitous pumpkin spice. If you are on social media, for sure you have seen a large variety of pumpkin spiced products, some real and some created using a little Photoshop such as pumpkin spice contact solution.\n\n \n\nHere is the thing though; I do not consider the obsession with Pumpkin spice to be tacky, if anything it is simply an overcorrection for something lacking in the American palate: Spice.\n\n \n\nAt its core pumpkin spice may or may not contain actual pumpkin, but it always contains cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cloves. These spices are integral to most cuisines, but they are used sparingly in the American kitchen.\n\n \n\nMost cultures use these spices in various teas, liquors, hot and cold beverages and even sodas. Most people should be familiar with Masala Chai, Horchata, Ginger Beer, Caf\u00e9 de Olla, Cider, Mulled wine, etc. I feel like there is a legitimate craving for these flavors that is only partially quenched by a pumpkin spiced beer or latte.\n\n \n\nBut those spices do not just belong in our drinks; they belong in our food too. Most stews benefit from a cinnamon stick that you remove before serving, much like you would with a bay leaf. Ginger, allspice and cloves should be as welcome as pepper is, adding depth and flavor to the meats and vegetables we consume. Our sauces should contain those pleasing aromas that we waste on candles and air fresheners.\n\n \n\nUltimately my argument is not so much a defense of pumpkin spice, but recognition of why we crave it. We want to spice up our lives, and commercially we only get to do it a few months out of the year. My prescription is to catch up with the rest of the world, perhaps by sampling their spiced foods and beverages. And once you start having these spices year round, you will find that you are just as excited for winter, spring and summer as well.\n\nhttps://www.theconnoisseurs.com/2017/10/06/the-theory-of-pumpkin-spice-everything/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/74pwxn/the_theory_of_pumpkin_spice_everything/", "created_utc": 1507317850.0, "score": 3, "author": "JavierLoustaunau", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/74pwxn/the_theory_of_pumpkin_spice_everything/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Medium rare and rare stakes/meats.", "selftext": "So, recently I have seen websites saying that \"rare or medium rare\" is the only way to eat a stake. Now that triggered me a lot, where do these people come from ? I am not going to debate safeness, any stake eater knows a safe factor can be both safe 50% / 50% unsafe  regardless of the way its cooked.\n\nHowever more and more people are saying recently that's the only way to eat, well fucktwats what If I told you that mankind switched from raw meat to cooked meat once fire was discovered and it had a lot of impact on our evolution, from the brain developing more after we started eating meat, once cooked the digestive process took less, allowing the brain to grow more and develop new functions, with the energy spent from not having to digest raw meat.\n\nThat is just one small example. I come from a line of trappers and hunters and I've eaten from mice to coons, squirrels up to Canadian Bison and Moose, and never did I once ate that meat rare or medium rare. I am not saying it's wrong you can eat it as you like (I still find it disgusting and in my vision, not the way to eat meat).\n\nSo since people continue with this bullshit, here's some news, no meat was made to be eaten rare or raw, and yes meat must be properly cooked, you can try to be interesting and pretend, give me online fancy shit and deny it, but in the end it's simple, meat is eaten cooked, not rare or raw, fact of evidence ? our fucking evolution.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/d6etbc/medium_rare_and_rare_stakesmeats/", "created_utc": 1568903249.0, "score": 0, "author": "None", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/d6etbc/medium_rare_and_rare_stakesmeats/", "html_title": ""}

I have truly loved a life raised on the promise of Sunday peach cobbler and mason jars forever topped off with sweet tea. My aunts made casseroles and dressings in baking dishes the size of a pickup truck beds.  Our noses constantly absorbed the aromas as we watched from underneath the porch, hoping to wait out the diamondback rattlesnake rumored to live in the rose bush our baseball was last seen bounding into. We glistened with the sheen of sweat that arrives early spring and stays late into the endless August summer. We would rise early and stuff our bellies on blueberry or crabapple jelly piled high on biscuits so fluffy they certainly were plucked from the clouds ahead of the summer thundershowers that always sent us scurrying for the closest front porch. Those were the days spent stressfully focused on catching frogs from mud hole out past the pecan trees, long long before the responsibilities of adulthood. Powered by those southern delicacies, we had the fuel to carry us to sundown, where the darkness limited us to telling stories and lies underneath the canopy of my grandmothers porch. \n\nI have been fortunate as an adult to be able to travel and taste a lot of corners of our great country and world. I have eaten a 30$ pimento cheese sandwich with a 4$ pickle in California and BBQ from an oven promised to be genuinely southern in Denver CO. As tasty as their food may have been, it\u2019s always left my pallet longing for the cuisine of my youth, and the accompanying stories from my uncle\u2019s that were never hindered by truth. \n\nI know not everyone is blessed to be from the south, but your life will always benefit cherishing the geography and flavor of your generations youth. \n\nJD", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/qkio9g/flavor_of_my_generation/", "created_utc": 1635786740.0, "score": 8, "author": "jtd1437", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/qkio9g/flavor_of_my_generation/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Roux", "selftext": "I realized there's really no point pining after food and the more I embrace a more ascetic lifestyle, the easier it is for me, mentally. \n\nI confess, I didn't have a proper meal for nearly 24 hours because I wasn't sure what my body wanted. Anyway, I ended up making Japanese curry for the sake of eating but I was truly satisfied. \n\nSadly, I didn't have onions, only spring onions which I decided to substitute anyway. Saut\u00e9ed them with carrots and potatoes, a drizzle of garlic-infused olive oil and some butter. I added water, sprinkled freshly-cracked pepper and allowed it to simmer as per instructions.

I didn't think I'd post it here (only found out about this sub a few seconds ago) but I wanted to share my experience making my lunch. I recently watched a jap mukbang featuring pollock roe and raw eggs on a bed of rice (Yuka Kinoshita's channel) and it made me really really curious about the taste. I'm not sure where I can buy the pollock roe in my area and it's more difficult to find the dish, now that a lot of restaurants have closed up. I remember buying it while I was traveling but accidentally left it at a friend's hoyse (;_;) so I never really had a chance to taste it. \n\nSo today, I had some smoked salmon, minced it until the texture turned mushy, cooked some rice and ate it with a side of pickled vegetables (kimchi). I thought to pair it with another carb (why not yolo) so I cooked mi goreng (I didn't add the spicy sauce coz I didn't want to overwhelm my tastebuds) and crispy fried egg with runny yolk. It was nice. \n\nAnyone thinks the tastes of mentaiko and smoked salmon are comparable?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/fy8s4r/mentaiko_minced_smoked_samon/", "created_utc": 1586494672.0, "score": 0, "author": "Noir_movies", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/fy8s4r/mentaiko_minced_smoked_samon/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I wrote a guide to the food and food-culture in Switzerland.", "selftext": "\n------------------------------\n\n\nNot all of these are truly Swiss, but what isn\u2019t unique is very dominant at least in Switzerland. [Wikipedia has a good list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cuisine). Mostly the food is fairly normal by western standards. However veal is very common here, as is horse (my town even has a specialist butcher for horse meat) which will not be to everyone\u2019s ethical taste.\n\nThis post is also going to be far from complete. There are endless little variations on cured meats, breads, and cheese all over the country. And I will probably have missed a few big things too. And as with all my posts is going to be heavily biased towards the German speaking region (which itself makes things confusing by having different names/spelling in every town).\n\nFor more info\n\n* **[Helvetic Kitchen](https://www.helvetickitchen.com/)** the website, also in [book form](https://www.bergli.ch/collections/all/products/helvetic-kitchen).\n\n* **[Tiptopf](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiptopf)** (playing on Tip-Top which the Swiss use surprisingly often and think of as their own) is the basic Swiss cooking bible, though only in German as far as I know.\n\n* **[Patrimoine culinaire](http://www.patrimoineculinaire.ch/)**, though it is also language limited.\n\nGenerally it isn\u2019t hard to find a local dish, or a local version of a product. Walking around a Coop or Migros supermarket will make it obvious what is local. You can often buy cheese, meat, eggs, honey and other products direct from farms which have an honesty box (or sometimes even a vending machine) outside the farmhouse or by a walking path. The local market (Saturday morning, and maybe also during the week) is a safe bet too.\n\nWith thanks to /r/askswitzerland for [their feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/) to me, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/e01f0fb/) especially deserves to be recognised.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Cheese**\n\nThere are something along the lines of 450 different cheeses, and various dishes made using them. You could (and somebody probably has) write a gigantic book on this.\n\nThere are various groups and often rules like what altitude the cows must have been and what they have eaten. A few types you commonly see are Mutschli, Hobel (German for plane). Sbrinz is a hard cheese that is like the Swiss Parmesan.\n\nThe [Swiss Cheese Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Cheese_Union) were like a sinister cheesy mafia who controlled what was made and pushed Fondue and Raclette into the national dishes they are today. Though they were apparently responsible for [this amazing sponsored ski uniform](https://i.imgur.com/vsKscqP.jpg) which is wonderful enough to forgive them for everything.\n\nEmmentaler, Gruyere and Appenzeller are the big 3 cheese types that you will find in every shop in Switzerland. \n\n* **Emmental**, or if it is in the actual region protected form Emmentaler Switzerland (non-protected may well come from France, Germany or a range of other places), is the classic hole filled \u201cSwiss Cheese\u201d of cartoons. The mild and normal versions are a bit bland, but the strong has a good flavour to it.\n\n* **Gruyere** from the touristy village of the same name. A classic choice for melting.\n\n* **Appenzeller** is the least well known of the three (outside of Switzerland anyway) and I think the most interesting by far. Be sure to try some. [They also have the best adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZNqXJAaGo).\n\nBeyond these there are endless cheeses that are found in each area and time of year.\n\nThen there are of course the famous cheese based meals\u2026.\n\n* **Fondue** is one of the classic dishes associated with Switzerland, and most Swiss people do own a set. Best eaten in cold weather, with wine or black tea on the side. Remember not to lose your bread in the pot or let your mouth touch the fork. An interesting (especially to watch) variation on this is **Ch\u00e4sb\u00e4ngel** which is basically a fondue filled baguette that I have only seen at Basel Herbstmesse, trying to eat it without causing an eruption of liquid cheese is something of a challenge.\n\n* **Raclette**. This tends to be less well known than Fondue, but works much better during summer. Traditionally it should be a fat slab of cheese where you keep scraping the melted top off, however for practical reasons it is most commonly seen as thin slices that you put under a mini grill.\n\n* **Ch\u00e4sw\u00e4ie / K\u00e4sew\u00e4he** more of a snack than a full meal. A savoury cheese pie that can be found in most cafes and bakeries.\n\n* **La Bo\u00eete Chaude** comes from the Jura and is far less known than Fondue or Raclette and is unsurprisingly rather rare to come across. Basically a oven baked cheese dish.\n\n* **Ch\u00e4sschnitte** is sort of prepared like French toast, but with a more Welsh Rarebit like savoury nature. [Apparently it is a big part of Swiss-army life](https://www.helvetickitchen.com/recipes/2015/9/29/militarkaseschnitten)\n\nThere are also a few show dairies about where you can see it being made like Gruyere or Emmental amongst others (anywhere touristy will probably have one somewhere around it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Chocolate**\n\nUnsurprisingly the options here are also pretty extensive.\n\nAt the top (expensive) end you have local specialised chocolate shops. This will almost always be the best option (but not the cheapest). The most famous (make your own mind up on best or not) is [Spr\u00fcngli](https://www.spruengli.ch/cms/en/) in Z\u00fcrich which has expanded so much that they have their own factory elsewhere now and chain stores in various other places (even in Dubai) - but every city/town will have at least one independent special shop, many of which double as cafes (Eg: [Hofer in Solothurn](https://www.confiseriehofer.ch/), or [Walder in Neuchatel](http://walder-confiserie.ch/)). Just to make the point [here is an article about the endless options in Z\u00fcrich](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/01/zurich-switzerland-chocolate-capital-city-break).\n\nThe 2nd fanciest option is the [L\u00e4derach chain of shops](https://www.laederach.com/shop/en/full-catalog.html) which can be found just about anywhere with tourists and/or more than 10,000 inhabitants. They are high quality and most notable for the gigantic slabs of chocolate in the windows. At the one in Bern you can book to do a chocolate workshop.\n\nIf you just want to buy a standard chocolate brand then supermarkets will be the cheapest option. They offer a big range of chocolate in just about any location, and in tourist areas the chocolate section tends to be massive.\n\nFrey, Cailler, and Ragusa are the most interesting options that are hard to find outside of the country. There is of course Lindt and Toblerone, but they are so common the world over that I wouldn\u2019t bother myself with buying them in Switzerland. \n\nKagi Fret is slightly more biscuit than chocolate but is one of the truly Swiss brands that most outsiders wouldn\u2019t know about.\n\nThe Branche praline/nut bars (Cailler are the best option, Coop do their own cheaper brand)  are very Swiss too.\n\nOne interesting choice of chocolates are Katzenzungen (cat\u2019s tongues). [The box design from the type sold at Coop is wonderfully odd.](https://i.imgur.com/PMc59Tj.jpg) Though they are not truly Swiss.\n\nAt Easter the shops fill up with ranks of chocolate hares who stare at you with manic smiles, which are probably meant to be cute - but to me [look like evil murder-bunnies](https://i.imgur.com/Bus3Al8.jpg).\n\n\nYou can visit the Cailler chocolate factory [my post on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/82yi34/gruy%C3%A8res_switzerland_on_a_snowy_sunday_in_march/), or the [Alprose museum](http://www.alprose.ch/museum/) which is in the arse-end of nowhere. There is also the Villars factory in Fribourg, which you can\u2019t tour but you can buy discount rejects from. And the [Ragusa factory in the Jura too\u2026](https://chezcamillebloch.swiss/en/)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Breakfast / Zn\u00fcni**\n\nZn\u00fcni (literally meaning 9am) is the slightly earlier version of elevenses. It might be a pile of bread-rolls and gipfeli (croissants) or it might be loafs of bread with jam, cheese, and meat. Either way it is the go to choice for how to celebrate your birthday or other occasions at work.\n\n* One very traditional breakfast or Zn\u00fcni is to get a bread-roll and stuff a branche chocolate into it. Like a DIY Pain au chocolat.\n\n* **M\u00fcsli and Bircherm\u00fcsli**. One of the few Swiss-German words to enter the English language.\n\n* **Butterz\u00f6pf** is a plaited bread that is the traditional go-to for Sunday morning breakfast (or any breakfast) \n\n* Croissants are called Gipfeli (little peaks). The Nussgipfel is a rather good option. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Meat**\n\n\n* **Cervelat** a beef/pork sausage. This is a key part of Swiss culture. To be truly Swiss you must go hiking with a pack of these and roast them over a little fire (having first cut the ends in a cross shape). The experience will be far more memorable than the flavour though it must be said.\n\n* **Bratwurst and brot** can be found almost anywhere as an easy fast food option. Oddly the bread is literally a chunk of bread - it has no resemblance to the shape of the Wurst so you have to alternate bites between each. This can make eating it and holding a drink something of a balancing act. Whether or not you have mustard with it is something of a regional rule - leading to the Senfgraben.\n\n\n**Dried meats**\n\nEvery little region has its own special ham or similar type of cured or dried meat. You can normally get a plate of mixed dried meats and cheeses at restaurants. [I refer you to this comment for more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/e01f0fb/).\n\n* **B\u00fcndnerfleisch** is one of the most common Swiss meats. [It also led to one of the most memorable incidents in Swiss politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBeLCDTPs8o).  \n\n* **Appenzeller Mostbr\u00f6ckli** is another favourite\n\n* **Landj\u00e4ger** is a stick of dried meat. Not purely Swiss, but very common here. [Though the Germans seem to see it as rather more romantic](https://i.imgur.com/fgVGVCX.jpg).\n\nBut again there are endless more around the country like: the thick **Saucisson** from the Romandie, \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ap\u00e9ro**\n\nThe Swiss really bloody love an Ap\u00e9ro. There is no better way to end the day, have an event, or just do whatever, than with a few drinks and light snacks.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Meals**\n\nA key part of lunchtime in Switzerland is saying [\u201cEn Guete\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSghY18nQhw&list=PLx3utklxhn0Ivr3BzcaN8TxXcld5Plkj5&index=21) (basically \u201cbon appetit\u201d) to everybody you see doing anything between 11:30 and 13:30.\n\nOne thing that surprised me is how much the Swiss utterly love to BBQ and regard summer as grill-season. The ownership and enthusiasm to break out the grill puts even the Aussies to shame. Starting a little fire in the countryside to cook something is always popular - you see makeshift fire pits everywhere.\n\n* **Salad**. Having a salad before a meal is downright essential. Usually it is a not very exciting green or mixed salad - but the Swiss utterly must eat one before a meal. Probably the most interesting salad option is **N\u00fcsslisalat**. Wurst-Salat is common too, but I consider that more German.\n\n* **Soup** is also pretty common before (or as) a meal. **B\u00fcndner Gerstensuppe** is one of the very Swiss options, though most areas have their own special types like Soledurner Wys\u00fcppli, or the Mehlsuppe served at Basel Fasnacht.\n\n* **Regional platters**. Berner Platte, Appenzeller platte, etc:. Slices of cold meats, cheese, and some veg (or at least a gherkin). \n\n* **\u00c4lplermagronen** kind of like macaroni cheese, often served with apple sauce.\n\n* **R\u00f6sti** is the classic Swiss-German meal. So much so that the language divide between the French and German parts is called the R\u00f6stigraben. Basically it is a big hashbrown. \n\n* **Pastetli / Vol-au-vent** is kind of like an open topped pie made with puff-pastry. Usually a soft crust with a creamy mix of meat and mushrooms inside.\n\n* **Z\u00fcrcher Geschnetzeltes**\n\n* **Le papet Vaudois**\n\n* **Fleischvogel** (literally translates as meat-bird). Technically the German Rouladen, but the name makes them stand out - not least as there is no bird in it normally.\n\n* **Cordon Bleu**. Basically a schnitzel. Take a large bit of pig/veal, hit it until it is thin and tender, combine with cheese and ham, cover in breadcrumbs and fry. Tasty, hearty, and most of your days calories in one easy go.\n\n* **Mountain/lake fish** they might be far from the sea but it is easy to spot big trout and other fish in the lakes and rivers.\n\n* The Swiss-Germans go as crazy as the Germans for asparagus in the springtime. Expect it to dominate the menus then.\n\n* Less well known, but in autumn rich venison and other game dishes appear on menus and are a perfect fit for the season\n\n* **Aromat** is an MSG based condiment found on most tables.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Dessert**\n\nThere are various staples\n\n* **Fruit W\u00e4he** a flan type cake with fruit on top. Easy and found all over.\n\n* **Vermicelle**. Basically spaghetti like worms made from pureed and sweetened chestnut. Usually served with cream, and sometimes schnapps too. Especially common in autumn and my favourite dessert option.\n\n* **Meringue**. Supposedly coming from the town of Meiringen. Which is also noted as the death site of Sherlock Holmes. You can combine both into one and get a Meringue with Sherlock Holmes on it. The french speaking town of Gruyeres does a thick double cream with Meringue dish (and it is one the best attempts outside of the UK of proper thick cream).\n\nThere are also various regional cakes:\n\n* **B\u00fcndner Nusstorte** is the classic. Very rich so you only need abit, but it lasts well so no rush with it.\n\n* **Birnbrot** is a pair based pastry. Slightly towards a mince pie in theory, but a different taste and texture. \n\n* **Zuger Kirschtorte** is fairly famous, though I have yet to try it.\n\nAnd the list just keeps on going\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nDrinks\n\n* **Rivella** is basically the Swiss national soft drink - like Iron Bru is to the Scots. The taste isn\u2019t especially good or bad. What does make it memorable is that is is made with milk serum (though you would never know that from the taste or look).\n\n* **Tea**. You get various alpine herbal types, including in some places Edelweis which is quite good. (Needless to say you can\u2019t get a proper British tea)\n\n* **Coffee** tends to be quite small (despite the high price) and cappuccino is often something of a disappointment. \u201cHaus\u201d or \u201cSpecial\u201d coffee means with enough schnapps to knock out a small animal. \u201cKafi Lutz\u201d is a popular choice during Fasnacht.\n\nFor alcoholic drinks saying cheers (or prost as it is) is a somewhat tedious affair as you have to clink the glass of every single person whilst looking them in the eye and saying their name. I rather miss the quick and easy British way of saying cheers, waving your glass in the air for a second, then drinking.\n\n* **Beer**. There are an amazing number of breweries from national to local level - [the one-man website Bov.ch is trying to visit and review all of them](https://www.bov.ch/beer/index-Y.html). Feldschlossen is the mass produced default beer that is everywhere. Better than the default lagers in the UK, but still best avoided for something more interesting and local if possible. Finding a more local beer in bars or the supermarkets won\u2019t be a problem. If you are on a tight budget then Coop lager is 50 cents a can (no idea how it tastes myself though).\n\n* **Wine**. The Swiss make surprising quantities of wine in just about every region of the country, most of which is drunk domestically so you rarely see it abroad. It is generally more expensive than imported wines but is also generally good quality (or at least it is now, apparently it was awful 20 years ago when wine imports were limited and there was no real competition). \n\n* **Whisky**. The Swiss do make some surprisingly good (to my taste) whisky. S\u00e4ntis malt is the most common option.\n\n* **Schnapps**. Various local varieties, not a big fan myself.\n\n* **Appenzeller Alpenbitter**. Not a fan myself but it is rather popular.\n\n* **Absinthe**. Invented, banned and then re-legalised in Switzerland. The beautiful and rather forgotten Val de Travers in Neuchatel is the place to go for this. The train station at Noirague is well stocked with the stuff and is a starting point for a hike in the beautiful Aruse gorge or the Cru De Van. Further up the valley you can visit dedicated bars and distillers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Misc sweets/bits:**\n\n* **Kambly** little biscuits from the Emmental region.\n\n* **Biberli**. A slightly marzipan like cake from the Appenzell region. The little packets you find in supermarkets are great for taking on your travels. Though the proper stuff from a bakers is rather different - and much better really (if less practical).\n\n* **Ricola** the classic sweet with [the classic adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAoDzIsx03E). Interestingly they are a very ethical company and fund various types of research.\n\n* **Heiss maroni**. Not uniquely Swiss, but so super-common during the colder months that it is a real part of Swiss culture in winter..\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/8ojvpa/i_wrote_a_guide_to_the_food_and_foodculture_in/", "created_utc": 1528138742.0, "score": 3, "author": "travel_ali", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/8ojvpa/i_wrote_a_guide_to_the_food_and_foodculture_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "The Theory of 'Pumpkin Spice' Everything.", "selftext": "Fall brings many things that people love: cooler weather, brightly colored leaves, cozy sweaters and the now ubiquitous pumpkin spice. If you are on social media, for sure you have seen a large variety of pumpkin spiced products, some real and some created using a little Photoshop such as pumpkin spice contact solution.\n\n \n\nHere is the thing though; I do not consider the obsession with Pumpkin spice to be tacky, if anything it is simply an overcorrection for something lacking in the American palate: Spice.\n\n \n\nAt its core pumpkin spice may or may not contain actual pumpkin, but it always contains cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cloves. These spices are integral to most cuisines, but they are used sparingly in the American kitchen.\n\n \n\nMost cultures use these spices in various teas, liquors, hot and cold beverages and even sodas. Most people should be familiar with Masala Chai, Horchata, Ginger Beer, Caf\u00e9 de Olla, Cider, Mulled wine, etc. I feel like there is a legitimate craving for these flavors that is only partially quenched by a pumpkin spiced beer or latte.\n\n \n\nBut those spices do not just belong in our drinks; they belong in our food too. Most stews benefit from a cinnamon stick that you remove before serving, much like you would with a bay leaf. Ginger, allspice and cloves should be as welcome as pepper is, adding depth and flavor to the meats and vegetables we consume. Our sauces should contain those pleasing aromas that we waste on candles and air fresheners.\n\n \n\nUltimately my argument is not so much a defense of pumpkin spice, but recognition of why we crave it. We want to spice up our lives, and commercially we only get to do it a few months out of the year. My prescription is to catch up with the rest of the world, perhaps by sampling their spiced foods and beverages. And once you start having these spices year round, you will find that you are just as excited for winter, spring and summer as well.\n\nhttps://www.theconnoisseurs.com/2017/10/06/the-theory-of-pumpkin-spice-everything/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/74pwxn/the_theory_of_pumpkin_spice_everything/", "created_utc": 1507317850.0, "score": 3, "author": "JavierLoustaunau", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/74pwxn/the_theory_of_pumpkin_spice_everything/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I\u2019ll never grace an Armani ad or even look forward to a day of sunbathing at the beach shirtless. I have truly loved a life raised on the promise of Sunday peach cobbler and mason jars forever topped off with sweet tea. My aunts made casseroles and dressings in baking dishes the size of a pickup truck beds.  Our noses constantly absorbed the aromas as we watched from underneath the porch, hoping to wait out the diamondback rattlesnake rumored to live in the rose bush our baseball was last seen bounding into. We glistened with the sheen of sweat that arrives early spring and stays late into the endless August summer. We would rise early and stuff our bellies on blueberry or crabapple jelly piled high on biscuits so fluffy they certainly were plucked from the clouds ahead of the summer thundershowers that always sent us scurrying for the closest front porch. Those were the days spent stressfully focused on catching frogs from mud hole out past the pecan trees, long long before the responsibilities of adulthood. Powered by those southern delicacies, we had the fuel to carry us to sundown, where the darkness limited us to telling stories and lies underneath the canopy of my grandmothers porch. \n\nI have been fortunate as an adult to be able to travel and taste a lot of corners of our great country and world. I have eaten a 30$ pimento cheese sandwich with a 4$ pickle in California and BBQ from an oven promised to be genuinely southern in Denver CO. As tasty as their food may have been, it\u2019s always left my pallet longing for the cuisine of my youth, and the accompanying stories from my uncle\u2019s that were never hindered by truth. \n\nI know not everyone is blessed to be from the south, but your life will always benefit cherishing the geography and flavor of your generations youth. \n\nJD", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/qkio9g/flavor_of_my_generation/", "created_utc": 1635786740.0, "score": 7, "author": "jtd1437", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/qkio9g/flavor_of_my_generation/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I wrote a guide to the food and food-culture in Switzerland.", "selftext": "\n------------------------------\n\n\nNot all of these are truly Swiss, but what isn\u2019t unique is very dominant at least in Switzerland. [Wikipedia has a good list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cuisine). Mostly the food is fairly normal by western standards. However veal is very common here, as is horse (my town even has a specialist butcher for horse meat) which will not be to everyone\u2019s ethical taste.\n\nThis post is also going to be far from complete. There are endless little variations on cured meats, breads, and cheese all over the country. And I will probably have missed a few big things too. And as with all my posts is going to be heavily biased towards the German speaking region (which itself makes things confusing by having different names/spelling in every town).\n\nFor more info\n\n* **[Helvetic Kitchen](https://www.helvetickitchen.com/)** the website, also in [book form](https://www.bergli.ch/collections/all/products/helvetic-kitchen).\n\n* **[Tiptopf](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiptopf)** (playing on Tip-Top which the Swiss use surprisingly often and think of as their own) is the basic Swiss cooking bible, though only in German as far as I know.\n\n* **[Patrimoine culinaire](http://www.patrimoineculinaire.ch/)**, though it is also language limited.\n\nGenerally it isn\u2019t hard to find a local dish, or a local version of a product. Walking around a Coop or Migros supermarket will make it obvious what is local. You can often buy cheese, meat, eggs, honey and other products direct from farms which have an honesty box (or sometimes even a vending machine) outside the farmhouse or by a walking path. The local market (Saturday morning, and maybe also during the week) is a safe bet too.\n\nWith thanks to /r/askswitzerland for [their feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/) to me, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/e01f0fb/) especially deserves to be recognised.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Cheese**\n\nThere are something along the lines of 450 different cheeses, and various dishes made using them. You could (and somebody probably has) write a gigantic book on this.\n\nThere are various groups and often rules like what altitude the cows must have been and what they have eaten. A few types you commonly see are Mutschli, Hobel (German for plane). Sbrinz is a hard cheese that is like the Swiss Parmesan.\n\nThe [Swiss Cheese Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Cheese_Union) were like a sinister cheesy mafia who controlled what was made and pushed Fondue and Raclette into the national dishes they are today. Though they were apparently responsible for [this amazing sponsored ski uniform](https://i.imgur.com/vsKscqP.jpg) which is wonderful enough to forgive them for everything.\n\nEmmentaler, Gruyere and Appenzeller are the big 3 cheese types that you will find in every shop in Switzerland. \n\n* **Emmental**, or if it is in the actual region protected form Emmentaler Switzerland (non-protected may well come from France, Germany or a range of other places), is the classic hole filled \u201cSwiss Cheese\u201d of cartoons. The mild and normal versions are a bit bland, but the strong has a good flavour to it.\n\n* **Gruyere** from the touristy village of the same name. A classic choice for melting.\n\n* **Appenzeller** is the least well known of the three (outside of Switzerland anyway) and I think the most interesting by far. Be sure to try some. [They also have the best adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZNqXJAaGo).\n\nBeyond these there are endless cheeses that are found in each area and time of year.\n\nThen there are of course the famous cheese based meals\u2026.\n\n* **Fondue** is one of the classic dishes associated with Switzerland, and most Swiss people do own a set. Best eaten in cold weather, with wine or black tea on the side. Remember not to lose your bread in the pot or let your mouth touch the fork. An interesting (especially to watch) variation on this is **Ch\u00e4sb\u00e4ngel** which is basically a fondue filled baguette that I have only seen at Basel Herbstmesse, trying to eat it without causing an eruption of liquid cheese is something of a challenge.\n\n* **Raclette**. This tends to be less well known than Fondue, but works much better during summer. Traditionally it should be a fat slab of cheese where you keep scraping the melted top off, however for practical reasons it is most commonly seen as thin slices that you put under a mini grill.\n\n* **Ch\u00e4sw\u00e4ie / K\u00e4sew\u00e4he** more of a snack than a full meal. A savoury cheese pie that can be found in most cafes and bakeries.\n\n* **La Bo\u00eete Chaude** comes from the Jura and is far less known than Fondue or Raclette and is unsurprisingly rather rare to come across. Basically a oven baked cheese dish.\n\n* **Ch\u00e4sschnitte** is sort of prepared like French toast, but with a more Welsh Rarebit like savoury nature. [Apparently it is a big part of Swiss-army life](https://www.helvetickitchen.com/recipes/2015/9/29/militarkaseschnitten)\n\nThere are also a few show dairies about where you can see it being made like Gruyere or Emmental amongst others (anywhere touristy will probably have one somewhere around it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Chocolate**\n\nUnsurprisingly the options here are also pretty extensive.\n\nAt the top (expensive) end you have local specialised chocolate shops. This will almost always be the best option (but not the cheapest). The most famous (make your own mind up on best or not) is [Spr\u00fcngli](https://www.spruengli.ch/cms/en/) in Z\u00fcrich which has expanded so much that they have their own factory elsewhere now and chain stores in various other places (even in Dubai) - but every city/town will have at least one independent special shop, many of which double as cafes (Eg: [Hofer in Solothurn](https://www.confiseriehofer.ch/), or [Walder in Neuchatel](http://walder-confiserie.ch/)). Just to make the point [here is an article about the endless options in Z\u00fcrich](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/01/zurich-switzerland-chocolate-capital-city-break).\n\nThe 2nd fanciest option is the [L\u00e4derach chain of shops](https://www.laederach.com/shop/en/full-catalog.html) which can be found just about anywhere with tourists and/or more than 10,000 inhabitants. They are high quality and most notable for the gigantic slabs of chocolate in the windows. At the one in Bern you can book to do a chocolate workshop.\n\nIf you just want to buy a standard chocolate brand then supermarkets will be the cheapest option. They offer a big range of chocolate in just about any location, and in tourist areas the chocolate section tends to be massive.\n\nFrey, Cailler, and Ragusa are the most interesting options that are hard to find outside of the country. There is of course Lindt and Toblerone, but they are so common the world over that I wouldn\u2019t bother myself with buying them in Switzerland. \n\nKagi Fret is slightly more biscuit than chocolate but is one of the truly Swiss brands that most outsiders wouldn\u2019t know about.\n\nThe Branche praline/nut bars (Cailler are the best option, Coop do their own cheaper brand)  are very Swiss too.\n\nOne interesting choice of chocolates are Katzenzungen (cat\u2019s tongues). [The box design from the type sold at Coop is wonderfully odd.](https://i.imgur.com/PMc59Tj.jpg) Though they are not truly Swiss.\n\nAt Easter the shops fill up with ranks of chocolate hares who stare at you with manic smiles, which are probably meant to be cute - but to me [look like evil murder-bunnies](https://i.imgur.com/Bus3Al8.jpg).\n\n\nYou can visit the Cailler chocolate factory [my post on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/82yi34/gruy%C3%A8res_switzerland_on_a_snowy_sunday_in_march/), or the [Alprose museum](http://www.alprose.ch/museum/) which is in the arse-end of nowhere. There is also the Villars factory in Fribourg, which you can\u2019t tour but you can buy discount rejects from. And the [Ragusa factory in the Jura too\u2026](https://chezcamillebloch.swiss/en/)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Breakfast / Zn\u00fcni**\n\nZn\u00fcni (literally meaning 9am) is the slightly earlier version of elevenses. It might be a pile of bread-rolls and gipfeli (croissants) or it might be loafs of bread with jam, cheese, and meat. Either way it is the go to choice for how to celebrate your birthday or other occasions at work.\n\n* One very traditional breakfast or Zn\u00fcni is to get a bread-roll and stuff a branche chocolate into it. Like a DIY Pain au chocolat.\n\n* **M\u00fcsli and Bircherm\u00fcsli**. One of the few Swiss-German words to enter the English language.\n\n* **Butterz\u00f6pf** is a plaited bread that is the traditional go-to for Sunday morning breakfast (or any breakfast) \n\n* Croissants are called Gipfeli (little peaks). The Nussgipfel is a rather good option. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Meat**\n\n\n* **Cervelat** a beef/pork sausage. This is a key part of Swiss culture. To be truly Swiss you must go hiking with a pack of these and roast them over a little fire (having first cut the ends in a cross shape). The experience will be far more memorable than the flavour though it must be said.\n\n* **Bratwurst and brot** can be found almost anywhere as an easy fast food option. Oddly the bread is literally a chunk of bread - it has no resemblance to the shape of the Wurst so you have to alternate bites between each. This can make eating it and holding a drink something of a balancing act. Whether or not you have mustard with it is something of a regional rule - leading to the Senfgraben.\n\n\n**Dried meats**\n\nEvery little region has its own special ham or similar type of cured or dried meat. You can normally get a plate of mixed dried meats and cheeses at restaurants. [I refer you to this comment for more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/8o76w8/i_am_trying_to_make_a_general/e01f0fb/).\n\n* **B\u00fcndnerfleisch** is one of the most common Swiss meats. [It also led to one of the most memorable incidents in Swiss politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBeLCDTPs8o).  \n\n* **Appenzeller Mostbr\u00f6ckli** is another favourite\n\n* **Landj\u00e4ger** is a stick of dried meat. Not purely Swiss, but very common here. [Though the Germans seem to see it as rather more romantic](https://i.imgur.com/fgVGVCX.jpg).\n\nBut again there are endless more around the country like: the thick **Saucisson** from the Romandie, \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ap\u00e9ro**\n\nThe Swiss really bloody love an Ap\u00e9ro. There is no better way to end the day, have an event, or just do whatever, than with a few drinks and light snacks.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Meals**\n\nA key part of lunchtime in Switzerland is saying [\u201cEn Guete\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSghY18nQhw&list=PLx3utklxhn0Ivr3BzcaN8TxXcld5Plkj5&index=21) (basically \u201cbon appetit\u201d) to everybody you see doing anything between 11:30 and 13:30.\n\nOne thing that surprised me is how much the Swiss utterly love to BBQ and regard summer as grill-season. The ownership and enthusiasm to break out the grill puts even the Aussies to shame. Starting a little fire in the countryside to cook something is always popular - you see makeshift fire pits everywhere.\n\n* **Salad**. Having a salad before a meal is downright essential. Usually it is a not very exciting green or mixed salad - but the Swiss utterly must eat one before a meal. Probably the most interesting salad option is **N\u00fcsslisalat**. Wurst-Salat is common too, but I consider that more German.\n\n* **Soup** is also pretty common before (or as) a meal. **B\u00fcndner Gerstensuppe** is one of the very Swiss options, though most areas have their own special types like Soledurner Wys\u00fcppli, or the Mehlsuppe served at Basel Fasnacht.\n\n* **Regional platters**. Berner Platte, Appenzeller platte, etc:. Slices of cold meats, cheese, and some veg (or at least a gherkin). \n\n* **\u00c4lplermagronen** kind of like macaroni cheese, often served with apple sauce.\n\n* **R\u00f6sti** is the classic Swiss-German meal. So much so that the language divide between the French and German parts is called the R\u00f6stigraben. Basically it is a big hashbrown. \n\n* **Pastetli / Vol-au-vent** is kind of like an open topped pie made with puff-pastry. Usually a soft crust with a creamy mix of meat and mushrooms inside.\n\n* **Z\u00fcrcher Geschnetzeltes**\n\n* **Le papet Vaudois**\n\n* **Fleischvogel** (literally translates as meat-bird). Technically the German Rouladen, but the name makes them stand out - not least as there is no bird in it normally.\n\n* **Cordon Bleu**. Basically a schnitzel. Take a large bit of pig/veal, hit it until it is thin and tender, combine with cheese and ham, cover in breadcrumbs and fry. Tasty, hearty, and most of your days calories in one easy go.\n\n* **Mountain/lake fish** they might be far from the sea but it is easy to spot big trout and other fish in the lakes and rivers.\n\n* The Swiss-Germans go as crazy as the Germans for asparagus in the springtime. Expect it to dominate the menus then.\n\n* Less well known, but in autumn rich venison and other game dishes appear on menus and are a perfect fit for the season\n\n* **Aromat** is an MSG based condiment found on most tables.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Dessert**\n\nThere are various staples\n\n* **Fruit W\u00e4he** a flan type cake with fruit on top. Easy and found all over.\n\n* **Vermicelle**. Basically spaghetti like worms made from pureed and sweetened chestnut. Usually served with cream, and sometimes schnapps too. Especially common in autumn and my favourite dessert option.\n\n* **Meringue**. Supposedly coming from the town of Meiringen. Which is also noted as the death site of Sherlock Holmes. You can combine both into one and get a Meringue with Sherlock Holmes on it. The french speaking town of Gruyeres does a thick double cream with Meringue dish (and it is one the best attempts outside of the UK of proper thick cream).\n\nThere are also various regional cakes:\n\n* **B\u00fcndner Nusstorte** is the classic. Very rich so you only need abit, but it lasts well so no rush with it.\n\n* **Birnbrot** is a pair based pastry. Slightly towards a mince pie in theory, but a different taste and texture. \n\n* **Zuger Kirschtorte** is fairly famous, though I have yet to try it.\n\nAnd the list just keeps on going\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nDrinks\n\n* **Rivella** is basically the Swiss national soft drink - like Iron Bru is to the Scots. The taste isn\u2019t especially good or bad. What does make it memorable is that is is made with milk serum (though you would never know that from the taste or look).\n\n* **Tea**. You get various alpine herbal types, including in some places Edelweis which is quite good. (Needless to say you can\u2019t get a proper British tea)\n\n* **Coffee** tends to be quite small (despite the high price) and cappuccino is often something of a disappointment. \u201cHaus\u201d or \u201cSpecial\u201d coffee means with enough schnapps to knock out a small animal. \u201cKafi Lutz\u201d is a popular choice during Fasnacht.\n\nFor alcoholic drinks saying cheers (or prost as it is) is a somewhat tedious affair as you have to clink the glass of every single person whilst looking them in the eye and saying their name. I rather miss the quick and easy British way of saying cheers, waving your glass in the air for a second, then drinking.\n\n* **Beer**. There are an amazing number of breweries from national to local level - [the one-man website Bov.ch is trying to visit and review all of them](https://www.bov.ch/beer/index-Y.html). Feldschlossen is the mass produced default beer that is everywhere. Better than the default lagers in the UK, but still best avoided for something more interesting and local if possible. Finding a more local beer in bars or the supermarkets won\u2019t be a problem. If you are on a tight budget then Coop lager is 50 cents a can (no idea how it tastes myself though).\n\n* **Wine**. The Swiss make surprising quantities of wine in just about every region of the country, most of which is drunk domestically so you rarely see it abroad. It is generally more expensive than imported wines but is also generally good quality (or at least it is now, apparently it was awful 20 years ago when wine imports were limited and there was no real competition). \n\n* **Whisky**. The Swiss do make some surprisingly good (to my taste) whisky. S\u00e4ntis malt is the most common option.\n\n* **Schnapps**. Various local varieties, not a big fan myself.\n\n* **Appenzeller Alpenbitter**. Not a fan myself but it is rather popular.\n\n* **Absinthe**. Invented, banned and then re-legalised in Switzerland. The beautiful and rather forgotten Val de Travers in Neuchatel is the place to go for this. The train station at Noirague is well stocked with the stuff and is a starting point for a hike in the beautiful Aruse gorge or the Cru De Van. Further up the valley you can visit dedicated bars and distillers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Misc sweets/bits:**\n\n* **Kambly** little biscuits from the Emmental region.\n\n* **Biberli**. A slightly marzipan like cake from the Appenzell region. The little packets you find in supermarkets are great for taking on your travels.

{"title": "The Theory of 'Pumpkin Spice' Everything.", "selftext": "Fall brings many things that people love: cooler weather, brightly colored leaves, cozy sweaters and the now ubiquitous pumpkin spice. If you are on social media, for sure you have seen a large variety of pumpkin spiced products, some real and some created using a little Photoshop such as pumpkin spice contact solution.\n\n \n\nHere is the thing though; I do not consider the obsession with Pumpkin spice to be tacky, if anything it is simply an overcorrection for something lacking in the American palate: Spice.\n\n \n\nAt its core pumpkin spice may or may not contain actual pumpkin, but it always contains cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cloves. These spices are integral to most cuisines, but they are used sparingly in the American kitchen.\n\n \n\nMost cultures use these spices in various teas, liquors, hot and cold beverages and even sodas. Most people should be familiar with Masala Chai, Horchata, Ginger Beer, Caf\u00e9 de Olla, Cider, Mulled wine, etc. I feel like there is a legitimate craving for these flavors that is only partially quenched by a pumpkin spiced beer or latte.\n\n \n\nBut those spices do not just belong in our drinks; they belong in our food too. Most stews benefit from a cinnamon stick that you remove before serving, much like you would with a bay leaf. Ginger, allspice and cloves should be as welcome as pepper is, adding depth and flavor to the meats and vegetables we consume. Our sauces should contain those pleasing aromas that we waste on candles and air fresheners.\n\n \n\nUltimately my argument is not so much a defense of pumpkin spice, but recognition of why we crave it. We want to spice up our lives, and commercially we only get to do it a few months out of the year. My prescription is to catch up with the rest of the world, perhaps by sampling their spiced foods and beverages. And once you start having these spices year round, you will find that you are just as excited for winter, spring and summer as well.\n\nhttps://www.theconnoisseurs.com/2017/10/06/the-theory-of-pumpkin-spice-everything/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodWriting/comments/74pwxn/the_theory_of_pumpkin_spice_everything/", "created_utc": 1507317850.0, "score": 3, "author": "JavierLoustaunau", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodWriting/comments/74pwxn/the_theory_of_pumpkin_spice_everything/", "html_title": ""}
