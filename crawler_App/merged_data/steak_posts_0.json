None of the fat was rendered and I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t a very marbled specimen to begin with. \n\nI love good steaks, but I\u2019ll even crush cheap diner steaks, and this was the worst steak I\u2019ve ever had in my life - I\u2019ve never not finished a steak and I just couldn\u2019t with this. Somehow given the texture and the poor taste it made the dry aged flavor almost nauseating. \n\nI should have sent it back or complained but I\u2019m a wittle baby. \n\nAnyway avoid this place.

{"title": "My paper plate special", "selftext": "This is my go to stand alone meal that I'll have 2-3 times through out the week.\n\nSomewhat detailed breakdown:\n1. Let steak sit out at least an hour and season both sides with salt about an hour before before grill time.  \n\n2. Wipe down remaining liquid on steak pulled out by salt just before grilling. I put a small smudge of mayo and rub in thoroughly on both sides just before it hits the grill (sounds weird, but enhances crust creation/texture).\n\n3. I use a top sided infrared grill on low flame setting but keep the steak close to the fire at all times.  Monitor internal temps with Bluetooth thermometer.  I aim to burn the hell out of the surface on both sides and pull the steak out when it hits 106 F (bear with me).\n\n3.  Let sit but add pepper and butter (cilantro/lime/butter used in pic).  Continue to monitor temperature.  I've found with the above grill method the steak with a solid crust will rise 30 degrees once pulled from the flames of hades provided by the infrared burner.  This one hit 136 F before it started to drop.  Once temp starts to drop pull out thermometer.\n\n4.  I like to sprinkle the plate with rosemary to absorb the juices and slice open a little early.  Sprinkle a light batch of worcestorshire sauce to finish.\n\nThanks for coming to my steak talk and I hope you enjoyed.

{"title": "Trial Run: Air Fryer Triple Sear", "selftext": "I wanted to try out the \"Japanese triple sear\" technique that I've seen on, e.g., *Food Wishes* and *Chiles and Smoke*, but don't currently have access to an open-flame grill. Rather than try to replicate it in a cast iron (which I suspected might not play nicely with the initial salt layer), I decided to try seeing whether the circulating hot air of the air fryer might serve as an *at-least passable* substitute for the rising hot air of an open grill.\n\nTo test this out, I picked up a 1.0 lb. chuck steak for this test run, which I *lightly* sprinkled with kosher salt to dry-brine over night (partly to ensure that the interior would be seasoned, but also to dry out the exterior). Then, today, I took the steak out of the refrigerator about two hours before it was time to start cooking *just in case* tempering the meat might help.\n\nOnce it was time to cook, I started pre-heating the air fryer to 400 F. While the air fryer was preheating, I coated the the steak with toasted sesame oil and then added a generous layer of kosher salt. (Unfortunately, at this point, I was too eager to start cooking for me to take any pictures.)\n\nOnce I put the steak into the air fryer, I cooked it 3 minutes on one side and then 2-and-a-half minutes on the other. I then took it out to soak it 1 minute *per side* in Japanese whisky (specifically, Suntory Toki) before putting back into the air fryer for another 3 minutes on one side and 2-and-a-half on the other.\n\nI then took it out again to soak another 1 minute per side, this time in soy sauce with a bit of liquid smoke added in (specifically, 1/2 oz. of liquid smoke in about 7-9 oz. of soy sauce) before putting back in for 3 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I didn't end up with a particularly crispy crust, but I did end up with a particularly *tasty* one. Of note - I had been concerned at the possibility that both dry brining the steak *and* coating in salt for the first sear might leave it overly salty, but that didn't appear to be the case in the result.\n\nOn the other hand, it probably would have benefited if I had used a bit less of the liquid smoke. Additionally, if I had thought to have my cast iron ready, I probably could have finished it off with a more traditional sear without overcooking the interior.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8ro24", "created_utc": 1745714649.0, "score": 1, "author": "Quadhelix0", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/steak/comments/1k8ro24/trial_run_air_fryer_triple_sear/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My paper plate special", "selftext": "This is my go to stand alone meal that I'll have 2-3 times through out the week.\n\nSomewhat detailed breakdown:\n1. Let steak sit out at least an hour and season both sides with salt about an hour before before grill time.  \n\n2. Wipe down remaining liquid on steak pulled out by salt just before grilling. I put a small smudge of mayo and rub in thoroughly on both sides just before it hits the grill (sounds weird, but enhances crust creation/texture).\n\n3. I use a top sided infrared grill on low flame setting but keep the steak close to the fire at all times.  Monitor internal temps with Bluetooth thermometer.  I aim to burn the hell out of the surface on both sides and pull the steak out when it hits 106 F (bear with me).\n\n3.  Let sit but add pepper and butter (cilantro/lime/butter used in pic).  Continue to monitor temperature.  I've found with the above grill method the steak with a solid crust will rise 30 degrees once pulled from the flames of hades provided by the infrared burner.  This one hit 136 F before it started to drop.  Once temp starts to drop pull out thermometer.\n\n4.  I like to sprinkle the plate with rosemary to absorb the juices and slice open a little early.

{"title": "Trial Run: Air Fryer Triple Sear", "selftext": "I wanted to try out the \"Japanese triple sear\" technique that I've seen on, e.g., *Food Wishes* and *Chiles and Smoke*, but don't currently have access to an open-flame grill. Rather than try to replicate it in a cast iron (which I suspected might not play nicely with the initial salt layer), I decided to try seeing whether the circulating hot air of the air fryer might serve as an *at-least passable* substitute for the rising hot air of an open grill.\n\nTo test this out, I picked up a 1.0 lb. chuck steak for this test run, which I *lightly* sprinkled with kosher salt to dry-brine over night (partly to ensure that the interior would be seasoned, but also to dry out the exterior). Then, today, I took the steak out of the refrigerator about two hours before it was time to start cooking *just in case* tempering the meat might help.\n\nOnce it was time to cook, I started pre-heating the air fryer to 400 F. While the air fryer was preheating, I coated the the steak with toasted sesame oil and then added a generous layer of kosher salt. (Unfortunately, at this point, I was too eager to start cooking for me to take any pictures.)\n\nOnce I put the steak into the air fryer, I cooked it 3 minutes on one side and then 2-and-a-half minutes on the other. I then took it out to soak it 1 minute *per side* in Japanese whisky (specifically, Suntory Toki) before putting back into the air fryer for another 3 minutes on one side and 2-and-a-half on the other.\n\nI then took it out again to soak another 1 minute per side, this time in soy sauce with a bit of liquid smoke added in (specifically, 1/2 oz. of liquid smoke in about 7-9 oz. of soy sauce) before putting back in for 3 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I didn't end up with a particularly crispy crust, but I did end up with a particularly *tasty* one. Of note - I had been concerned at the possibility that both dry brining the steak *and* coating in salt for the first sear might leave it overly salty, but that didn't appear to be the case in the result.\n\nOn the other hand, it probably would have benefited if I had used a bit less of the liquid smoke. Additionally, if I had thought to have my cast iron ready, I probably could have finished it off with a more traditional sear without overcooking the interior.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8ro24", "created_utc": 1745714649.0, "score": 1, "author": "Quadhelix0", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/steak/comments/1k8ro24/trial_run_air_fryer_triple_sear/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Eat or pass?", "selftext": "Grilled for the first time this spring and my six year old helped with the seasoning. \n\nRecipe:\n\n1. Preparation:\n\n* Filet Mignon: Trim any excess fat from the steak, and season both sides with salt and pepper. You can also add other spices or herbs to enhance the flavor, such as garlic powder, paprika, or thyme. Let the filet mignon sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.\n\n* Angus Beef Sirloin: Trim any excess fat from the steak, and season both sides with salt and pepper. You can also add other spices or herbs to enhance the flavor, such as garlic powder, paprika, or thyme. Let the sirloin sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.\n\n2. Cooking method:\n\n* Preheat your Weber E-330 three burner propane grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F). This will ensure that the steaks cook quickly and evenly, while still maintaining a good crust on the outside.\n\n* Place the Angus Beef Sirloin Steak on the grill first. Since it's a larger piece of meat, it will take longer to cook than the Filet Mignon. Cook the sirloin for about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on your desired level of doneness. Use a digital thermometer to check the internal temperature periodically (135\u00b0F for medium-rare, 145\u00b0F for medium, or 160\u00b0F for well-done).\n\n* While the sirloin is cooking, place the Filet Mignon Steak on a separate part of the grill. The filet mignon will cook faster due to its smaller size. Cook the filet mignon for about 2-3 minutes per side, depending on your desired level of doneness (125\u00b0F for rare, 135\u00b0F for medium-rare, or 145\u00b0F for medium).\n\n* Flip both steaks once during the cooking process to ensure even browning and a perfectly cooked center. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature before removing them from the grill.\n\n* Once the desired internal temperature is reached, remove both steaks from the grill and let them rest for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute within the meat, resulting in a tender, juicy final product.\n\nBy following this preparation and cooking method, you should achieve perfectly cooked steaks with zero pink on the sirloin and a good amount of pink on the filet mignon. The fat will be rendered completely, and both cuts of meat will be extremely tender.

The leaner sirloin filet came out amazing though. 120*F in the water for two hours, then hit it with the torch for a couple minutes, came up to 130*F-ish. Tasted more like tenderloin than sirloin.
