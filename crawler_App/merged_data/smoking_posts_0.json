It yielded 1,016 pounds of beef.\n\nThey gave us a lot of options on how we wanted it, and we ended up grounding about 400 pounds of it.\n\nThe good\u2026 you can\u2019t beat $2/lbs for steaks, and beef in general. The meat was unbelievable quality, and they asked us how we wanted it raised and finish as far as grain vs grass.\n\nThe bad\u2026 1,000 pounds of beef is a lot\u2026 I was NOT prepared for this\u2026 I went to pick it up with four coolers and turns out I needed about 10 more coolers\u2026 it was about 30 milk crates filled to the brim. A cow only has two briskets, limited steaks and very desirable cuts, so tons of roast and ground beef. At times I just rather have a ham and cheese sandwich over steaks\u2026 \n\nTwo years later we are still eating it\u2026 it\u2019s been in a deep freezer at -20f the whole time. I can confidently say that I have not notice any meat degradation, and the ground beef despite not being vacuumed sealed is as good as day 1.\n\nWe probably still have 200 pounds left which we should eat before summer. We\u2019ll probably order a whole one again after a six month detox and eating fish and chicken \ud83d\ude1c. \n\nTL:DR: If you can afford it and store it, you can go wrong.

{"title": "Update: Brisket For Friends - My First Time Ever Smoking", "selftext": "Cannot believe how well this turned out. Talk about beginners luck!\n\nFirst of all thank you all so much for the help and advice. I loved all the comments on my last post and you all gave some really amazing advice which made this experience way better.\n\nMy process:\n- rub was yellow mustard all over with just salt and pepper. That sat in the fridge for about 8h  the night before cooking\n- smoked for 2h @ 225 then 3h @ 250\n- pulled and wrapped in tin foil at the 5h mark\n- switched to the oven after the wrap was on cause I didn\u2019t want to push my luck with temp control and I was quickly running out of wood.\n- another 1:45 in the oven at 275\n- pulled it at 203F, it rose up to 205F on the counter and then once it had come down a couple I towel wrapped and threw it in the cooler for 3h rest\n\nThe smoker:\n- like I said in my other post the previous tenants had left this behind. It\u2019s a cheap smoker but worked all right in the end\n- the thing is very temperamental with heat it\u2019s not big so it quickly gets too hot. Pretty well had to burn only one small wood chunk at a time which required pretty well constant supervision the entire time\n- wood chunk would burn for 5-7 minutes and then I would have to put a new one in. Very tedious process but generally kept the temps pretty stable which I was happy about, kind of +/- 15F range of target the whole time\n- the vents on this are very small so I found it wasn\u2019t getting enough air. I had good success using a wood chunk to prop the smoker box open a little bit. Kept most of the heat in and allowed enough air for a clean burn.\n- speaking of clean burn. Managed to keep the smoke clean for the bulk of this. Had three times through the cook where I let the temp get too low and had to fight it to get back up. Those usually resulted in a few minutes of white smoke but that was generally kept to a minimum which I was VERY pleased with.\n\nServed it with:\n- caramelized onions\n- spicy maple brussel sprouts \n- Mac & cheese\n- baked beans\n- Hot mustard bbq sauce\n\nSeparately, many of you yelled at me for doing this on a condo balcony. I will say you are right. Open fire is probably a bad idea and I will have to retire this thing until I have a house. I really enjoyed this experience though so my question is: are those pellet smokers safe for this type of condo smoking situation? Feels like much less fire risk with one of those but, as is the theme here, I have done zero research. The wife was also not happy about the smell of smoke in the condo, are they better from that perspective also?\n\nAnyway, once again, thank you for all the help and advice. I was truly laughing seeing all the people telling me how crazy I was and wishing me the best of luck.

These things typically run over $5,000 in this configuration. \n\nHe directed me to this one, which was in the back, that had some bent hinges and busted temp gauges due to a fall. They offered it to me for $2,000! I considered it but wanted to sleep on it because, while it was a great deal, $2,000 is still a lot of money. After a couple days of contemplating, I called and said I'd get it that day if they accepted $1,500, which they did. Found a local welder that fixed the hinges for $150. \n\nSo far I put glow in the dark gauges($25) for the top rack and ChefsTemp Protemp S1 gauges($120) for the bottom. Will get an official cover for it when they are ever in stock. \n\nPics 1, 2, 3, 4 are it in its current state. \n\nPics 5, 6, 7, 8 are the day I got it home.

I upgraded to this from an Old Country Brazos DLX and I have to say that the gap between the two smokers is a lot larger than I anticipated. The Brazos was a really good smoker but this thing is just in a different league. \n\nSide note: I got $700 for my Brazos DLX which has put my effective cost at $1,245. \n\nI don't run into this kind of luck often, but I wanted to share my story with some people that might appreciate it.

Electronic damper that kept the temp at a steady 225 degrees. From what I can recall, the brisket and spare ribs were completely coated in rub. Spare ribs took approx 3 1/2 hours, brisket was put in before you left at night and pulled in the morning, idr the temp it was pulled at.\n\nThe only weird process was the baby backs. They were glazed with a maple-mustard glaze, sprinkled with rub, layed out on a sheet tray with a little vinegar in the bottom. These would sit overnight in the alto-sham and then be put in the smoker for a couple hours in the morning to finish.\n\nThe maple-mustard glaze was (roughly, it's been too long)3 parts dijon mustard1 part maple syrup and a bunch of the rub mixed in to make a thin (but not too thin) glaze.\n\nWas the food any good? Well, we would average $10k in nightly sales. *In the 90's*. Busy af. I personally cannot stand their sauce, but to each their own. The rub is solid and I still use it to this day.  The restaurant closed in the mid-late 90's after they brought in some managers from California (smfh) that changed everything up and thought *they* knew better. Any other questions feel free to ask, I may or may not remember it's been 30 years.\n\nEDIT: not hating on Cali in particular, the people they brought in from Cali had zero experience in BBQ.

{"title": "Update: Smoking ribs in my car", "selftext": "I actually went through with my crazy idea of cooking pork ribs in my car. You can find my inital post about it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/15i21k3/smoking_ribs_in_my_car/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1)\n\nBefore I get a dozen comments. Yes, I'm aware that there was no smoking involved in this cook, but I'm sure some of y'all might find it amusing. Additionally, the cook stayed well within the 40F to 140F in 4 hrs rule, and the internal temperature of the meat reached 162 for about an hour, which is well above the USDA minimum safety temp of 145 for pork. \n\nI'm located in Baton Rouge, Lousiana and the day of the cook was mostly sunny and had a high of 102. My non-smoking \"smoker\" was a four door Honda civic with no window tinting and was parked in a parking lot with no shade. I cooked the ribs using only the heat provided by the sun. I put them in a covered ceramic crock pot, and I placed the crock pot behind the back seats in the civic.\n\n\nI started the cook right at 12 noon, and ended the cook at 5:20pm. I did place the empty crock pot in my car early to preheat. The max air temperature in the car reached 186. The max air temperature in the crock pot reached 173, and the max internal temp of the meat reached 162. The meat reached the minimum food safety temp of pork (145F) at 2:18pm.\n\nI had tested this same set up a few days prior and got a crock pot internal air temp of 204 with the crock pot being empty. I had hoped that the cook would reach that temperature as well, but I didn't account for the cooling effect of evaporation.\n\nRib prep: I removed the membrane and applied a homemade dry rub the night before the cook, and applied Sweet Baby Rays after the cook was completely done. \n\nTaste test: There was zero bark, and zero smoke flavor. The ribs were fairly moist and tasty on the thinner end that ended up getting submerged in the drippings that pooled in the bottom of the crock pot. However, the meatier part of the ribs that stayed above the drippings was actually overdone and dry. Overall, I would rate the ribs three out of ten stars.\n\nIf I had to do it over again, I would skip the crock pot and foil wrap the ribs with holes on the bottom to allow it to drip onto a baking sheet. Additionally, I would cook them for a shorter amount of time. If there is enough interest, I might do a second car cook.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15pa56a", "created_utc": 1691860817.0, "score": 1858, "author": "HatOnALamp", "num_comments": 278, "permalink": "/r/smoking/comments/15pa56a/update_smoking_ribs_in_my_car/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "These Christmas ribs turned out to be a failure", "selftext": "Originally my plan was to make brisket for Christmas but the Costco I went to didn't have any good briskets. They were all choice with zero marbling, even the wagyu ones so I tried beef ribs! \n\nI expected these ribs to have much more meat in them thinking they were two plates of ribs instead of 4 before opening them. They were pretty thin compared to the ones BBQ spots serve you.\n\n I did half of them with an olive oil binder and the other half with a gochujang binder and seasoned them with kosher salt and black pepper. \n\nSmoked at around 275\u00b0F with red oak for around 8 hours unwrapped. I aimed for probe tenderness, pulled them when they were probe tender 8-9 hrs cook time around 200\u00b0F internal then wrapped tossing them into a warm cooler with towels for around 3 hrs of resting time. \n\nThese ribs turned out really dry. They reminded me of all the chuck roasts I smoked like a brisket dry as hell. Flavor and bark was on point but a little too salty. It was literally beef jerky on a stick. The only good part was the fat which was rendered beautifully. I also made a brisket flat with the ribs and it came out extremely rubbery even my razor sharp butcher knife struggled to slice into it. The brisket never got probe tender at any point. \n\nMy first ever brisket last Thanksgiving was a divine master piece. Now these Christmas ribs and brisket turned out to be a nightmare, nobody in my family even liked it lol. I guess I got so lucky last Thanksgiving. This was such a discouraging cook and waste of money. I never had good results with smaller cuts of meat.

Shoulda have just rolled on to get the best bark. \n\n-Underestimated how much it would cook after removing it. The bigger the chunk, the more it\u2019ll keep cooking after you take it off. This was my biggest so far at 16 pounds I should have pulled it earlier. On the bigger ones, it might be worth starting to check in the 190\u2019s. \n\nWhat I did right: \ufffc\n\n-2.99/pound Kroger Brisket. Great deal. \n\n-Chupacabra Brisket Magic. My favorite seasoning hands down now. It\u2019s perfect. \n\n-Mustard binder. I tried Olive Oil again on my last one, and it caked and didn\u2019t stick near as good as the mustard. \n\n-Didn\u2019t cry about it \ud83e\udd23. Me and my wife made Brisket Chili which is literally the best I\u2019ve ever had and then burnt ends from the point. Got a few good slices and discovered some amazing recipes from the rest. I might dry out a brisket on purpose every now and then (I\u2019m kidding \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23). \n\n-Straight Hickory for the whole cook. I\u2019m from Tennessee I just put this in there to start a fight in the comments. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nSuper fun cook and I hope this helps some folks, yall have helped me a lot along the way.

I reached out to the creator and asked if I could have it. They graciously gave it up to me. \n\nI spent the next several months trying to build it up in to a food related sub. I learned so much from the contributors. I started smoking more. Trying different things and enjoying the results. \n\nOver the last decade this sub has exploded. We grew from 200 users to over 750,000. In that time I purchased two more smokers. I also got busy with other things in life. This sub is too big for me, and it deserves attention from other passionate people. \n\nI\u2019d like to add several moderators to the sub, and turn the management over to them. We get flooded with spam, frequent requests from companies for advertisements or giveaways, many daily posts and comments that need administrative reviews. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be removed as a mod, because I have deep love for this place. But ai would like to assemble a team of moderators with a vision for the future of r/smoking that have the time, experience, and drive to make this sub what it should be. \n\nIf you are interested, please leave a comment about yourself, what you bring to the table, and how you envision guiding r/smoking forward.

{"title": "Best brisket I have ever done.", "selftext": "Had some friends over this weekend and decided to go all out with a 15.5lb brisket for the occasion. \n\nIt was my first time trying a home made rub, and here's how it went down: I used a jalape\u00f1o mustard binder, then coated it with homemade S.P.G. (1:1:1/2 ratio), adding a bit more black pepper because it looked a little light, along with some paprika. Dry brined it in the fridge for 16 hours before getting it on the smoker at 1pm. \n\nFor wood, I mostly used hickory, with a bit of cherry for sweetness. I ran a slightly dirtier fire for the first 3 hours to really lock in that smoke flavor, then switched to a cleaner burn for the rest of the cook. I sprayed it with 1:1 apple cider vinegar ever hour after the 4 hour mark. (I didn\u2019t realize how much time that would add to the cook). \n\nIt smoked for 12 hours total at 250\u00b0F, then I wrapped it in butcher paper and finished it in the oven at 275\u00b0F for another 2.5 hours. The final temp was 202\u00b0F. After turning off the oven, I let it rest for 4 hours, then chilled it in the fridge for another 4 hours. Around 1pm the next day I reheated it at 250\u00b0F until it hit 160\u00b0F and held it around there until dinner. \n\nAll in all, it was a 28.5-hour journey from start to plate\u2014and it was great. The point was moist and was super Smokey. The flat was just a little drier that I would have liked but was still superb. Definitely the only way I\u2019m gonna do brisket from here on out.

{"title": "What I've Learned After 5 Years", "selftext": "I'm 5 years into my smoking journey and would like to share what I've learned:\n\n  \n**Smoker:** I started with a Traeger Timberline 850 and have also acquired a Chud Box and have now graduated into a Mill Scale 94. I have since gotten ride of the Traeger. In my opinion pellet grills vs offsets, you can make great BBQ with either. I learned a lot with the Traeger and wish I still had it. With the convenience of it, I would use it a lot more and it was more versatile. The Chud Box has been great, I make the best ribs and 1/2 chickens over the Mill Scale and Traeger. It is no where near as versatile as the Traeger or Mill Scale but serves it's purpose. The Mill Scale is definitely King but has it's drawbacks, it is quite the commitment to use and I use it much less than my Traeger. I live in a Northern State and to get smoking wood, I often spend more on the wood for the cook than anything else.\n\n  \n**Temperatures:** When I started with the Traeger, I tried to keep the temp as low as possible (225F super smoke) to \"maximize the smoke flavor\". I learned it does not render fat as much and hotter is better in my opinion. You're never going to get the smoke flavor out of a pellet as an offset. I don't cook anything less than 275F any more. I think it renders fat better, makes a quicker cook and turns out a better product.\n\n  \n**Seasoning:** I've tried all the seasonings (Meat Church, Malcom Reed, Chuds, anything else I find), and I've found the best is plain old kosher salt and 16 mesh black pepper with maybe a little onion powder or garlic powder. With leftovers, I'd rather have salt/pepper pulled pork/brisket to make left over sandwiches or turn into tacos. It's much more versatile with salt/pepper and being able to see the actual result of the cook/meat, I've learned much more as it's not masked by anything else. If you want to use a different flavor, try different BBQ sauces and/or make your own sauce.\n\n  \n**Meats:** Costco has the best ribs/brisket that I've found. My favorite meats to purchase are spare ribs, whole chickens and large turkey breasts. I enjoyed cooking briskets and got it figured out but it's such a time commitment/cost I haven't done one in a while. Turkey breasts and chickens you can never go wrong with. I enjoy making ribs 1x a month but make the most meals out of turkey or chicken.\n\n  \n**Equipment:** A Thermapen is a necessity. I've had a Thermoworks Dot and Thermoworks Signals, these are both initially useful but after a while you'll understand temperature vs time and alls I need anymore is a Thermapen. Insulated gloves and a wire grid rack are a must.\n\n  \n**Cooking:** I'd much rather have my meat rest longer than being hurried to finish a cook with people waiting. For pork butts or briskets, I want them to rest for at least 2 hours before I plan on serving, chickens/turkey at least 45 mins. Stressing about finishing a cook with hungry people waiting, is not fun. I think the product is better the longer it rests any way. Start sooner than you think you need to,  you can always throw your oven on it's lowest setting and hold your meat for however long you want.\n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1ke9loh/what_ive_learned_after_5_years/", "created_utc": 1746326218.0, "score": 66, "author": "JuniorBonnet", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/smoking/comments/1ke9loh/what_ive_learned_after_5_years/", "html_title": ""}

I know I could go for the Typhur with 2 probes also, but I'd like 4. While browsing, I found the ThermoMaven P4 (Amazon link below) that is just over half the price of the Typhur while having very similar features.

On Amazon, most of the reviews are positive, but I find it suspicious that they mostly are too positive. I did find a few reviews on YouTube, but they are from unknown channels and generally pretty short.

{"title": "Question about brisket timing (just trying to get a general idea)", "selftext": "Hey everyone - so I'm looking for a bit of advice on how you would go about doing this:\n\nI've always smoked packer briskets (I \\*love\\* the point and I don't want to pay far more for a pre-trimmed brisket that only consists of the flat). However when I was at Costco recently they had two pre-trimmed prime flats priced as whole brisket...so I grabbed them both because I have trouble passing up a bargain (plus I figured having a couple small 6ish pound briskets in the freezer wouldn't be a bad idea).\n\nSo here's what I'm looking at: this weekend we're going to a friend's place for a bbq around noon. My wife asked if I could smoke one of the flats and of course I say yes (I'm almost never in a better mood than when I have my smoker going). \n\nThe flat I'm going to smoke is just a hair over 6.5 pounds. I've already taken it out of the freezer to defrost and it's sitting in the fridge. BBQ is on Saturday.\n\nSo...how would you (more or less) time your smoke? I've done smokes where I start the packer the night before and let it take on a good bark at a lower temp before wrapping/pumping the temp first thing in the morning. However I'm guessing that if I try that with this flat I'm going to end up with dry roast beef.\n\nI know that there isn't a science to the timing (for me much more about internal temp/if the external temp probe goes in like a hot knife in butter) but I guess a general time range/strategy for this one would be really helpful.\n\nI'm guessing just \"wake up really early and get it on the smoker\" is going to be the way to go - but wanted to get some other opinions vs just winging it.\n\nThanks for any/all advice!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1kcjvpo/question_about_brisket_timing_just_trying_to_get/", "created_utc": 1746134154.0, "score": 2, "author": "Maximus3311", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/smoking/comments/1kcjvpo/question_about_brisket_timing_just_trying_to_get/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "First and Second Brisket", "selftext": "Hi, just saw this sub.\n\nI've wanted to try smoking for a bit and the weather got a bit better here so my roomate agreed they'd get the meat if I got the foil and smoke stuff. \n\nWe live in an apartment that provides Propane grills and won't allow us to use a smoker or charcoal grill on campus. Don't know why but whatever. \n\nSo I looked up as much as I could and found out getting smoking pellets and wrapping them in foil before poking some holes for the smoke to come out can work. \n\nIt was one whole 8.45lb brisket I just eyeballed it and cut it in half so it was basically 1 half being the flat and 1 half being some flat and the point. \n\n1st victim was the flat. Started cooking at 1500 or so, propane indirect heat, pellets on, brisket rubbed 3 nights before and wrapped in plastic wrap (it was supposed to be overnight but we had a medical issue) \n\nEnded up unwrapped and raised to room temp that afternoon and put on the left of the grill with the 2 burners under it off. And the other two on the right with the pellets set to about medium. \n\nSeemed like it sent fine. I had hiccups like not realizing I needed water to quench the smoking/flaming at times pellets, my phone dying, my roomates phone dying, and a hellacious wind bothering us. Ended up cooking in about 4 hours total tracked via thermoprobe wired. \n\nAt 165 I put a foil \"boat\" under it and tented it. Til 200 and the pulled and rested it. \n\nThe whole thing looked wet on top and when it was resting/cooking in its boat it was flooded with juice. \n\nThe brisket ended up very tough, very dry, and very salty. So... a fail.\n\n\n\n\nSecond round! This half had to be frozen then thawed due to time constraints. After it was fully thawed it was rubbed with a new mix of brown sugar, Chipotle powder, chili powder, way less sea salt, a good amount of fresh black pepper, cumin, powdered sage. \n\nIt got taken out after 12 hours wrapped in plastic and we attempted to start it but it started raining. Due to moving it around on the grill and transferring it I used pre-made spicy/sweet pork rub we had in the cabinet to fill the gaps since the rub I made I threw the extra away. \n\nIt then sat in the fridge just on a tray naked for a day. Next day starting at 1400 at roughly 40\u00b0 internal via probe it got put on.\n\nIt was windy *again* and I was also having trouble with my smoke pouches not combusting.  I kinda rush heated them when I noticed I couldn't smell smoke and opened a pouch at 125 to see the pellets were fresh and unburned.  \n\nTurned the flame up to get 2 pouches to smoke thinking it could compensate. Once they were smoking I turned the heat back down and closed the lid again because I didn't want the increased heat to effect the brisket. \n\nThings went okay. Ended up ashing out 3 pellet pouches by 153 leaving one left on the top rack kinda doing it's thing. That one died at 165.\n\nTemp was still rising at roughly 1\u00b0/min and at 19:16 I wrapped it in foil since it had hit 170 not really because of temp or anything. Wrapped it tight and set it to go and .. it set at 170.. for basically an hour. The last one didn't do this but I knew a stall was coming. But I also figured it wouldn't be too bad. \n\nBut nope about an hour later I was like \"okay this is breaking the laws of thermodynamics! (Not really but I was confused) so added another layer of foil to help trap more heat... didn't work. Turned indirect heat up full blast... didn't work. Moved the brisket to the lower part of the direct heat (it's a weird grill the big flames are in the back and the front is kinda small) still didn't raise it. Finally turned another set of flames on and turned *them* on and it broke 170! Unfortunately at 183 my temp probe screamed 243 357 438 HHH when I checked what the heck if I had like.. lit my brisket on fire. No... just the wire to the thermoprobe. The metal insulation hadn't helped it neither had it being several inches from the flame going up. \n\nSo I had to remove the probe. Tight wrap it. Decided to kill the third flame and turn the other two down and move the brisket back a bit. Gave it another 25 minutes and then pulled it. \n\nStored it wrapped in the oven (off) for 45 minutes then sliced it. I... think I sliced it wrong? With the lumpy part of the point to my left I sliced vertically going towards it from the right with the first few slices being mostly fat and... tough+juicy tough as in it was a bit chewy and you couldn't slice it with a fork. \n\nI want back and started slicing from the bottom up and these pieces were tender/soft/Flavorful. \n\nHaven't cut all the way through it and I suck at identifying grain patterns after meat is cooked. But I'm assuming the very back where the lump of the point is is tough because it was closest to the direct flame and/or I cut it wrong. \n\n\n\nAnyway that's my story. I have time-marks and temps etc but I figured that's more nerdy than I need to be here. \n\nBasically the first one(flat im assuming) cooked in about 4 hours and sucked. There was a slight smoke ring. \n\nSecond one cooked from 14:00-21:00 and had about an hours stall at 170\u00b0F also i cooked my thermoprobe. There was no smoke ring \n\n\nIf anyone wants to share tips tricks etc lemme know.\n\nNo I can't get an actual smoker; I can't afford it and also don't have a place for it. \n\nI got a 40lb bag of smoking pellets from Sams Club for $13 and I make a \"burrito\" out of roughly 1.5-2 cups of pellets in heavy foil then poke holes in the top. \n\nThe apartment has 2 4 burner propane grills and free unlimited propane for residents with a bottom and top rack. That's what I have to use. They don't want charcoal in them and I had to get a note from the fire department saying pellet pouches were okay as long as I took care of it properly.\n\nIm also looking for sides. I tried brussel sprouts wrapped in foil with butter salt and pepper for the first one just wrapped and holes poked(top rack over brisket). Turned out good tasting but roomate didn't like the texture. Also potatoes poked with a skewer all over, then rubbed with salt and butter and wrapped in foil with a hunk of butter(top rack over fire). They turned out great and crispy. Second try I did frozen asparagus in a foil pouch with a bunch of butter, salt, whole cloves of garlic, and lemon pepper with a hunk of parmesan cheese (top rack over brisket) and they turned out awful. No taste of seasoning at all, cheese didn't melt, garlic didn't roast, super mushy.

One of my favorite things to do in my ever-elusive free-time is barbecuing or grilling chicken, ribs, tri-tip, etc. I'm pretty good at it, and very little makes me happier than cooking outdoors for people I love.\n\nAbout a month ago, I started dating a vegetarian woman. She jokes that her least favorite thing about me is my affinity for meat-cookery. I say the same to her about her vegetarianism. \n\nWith that said, she's really something special and I'd like to invite her over and smoke something for her. Grilling has many obvious vegetarian options: Vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, tempeh, haloumi, and even those God-awful veggie burgers all take to direct-heat grilling very well. \n\nMy issue is with smoking. Are there any vegetarian items that do well when smoked low and slow the way one would, say, a pork shoulder or lamb leg? In a perfect world, I'd be able to set up the cooker in such a way that I could smoke a meat dish for me and a vegetarian dish for her side-by-side in the same cooker. I just can't think of what (if anything) could be cooked in that manner.\n\nI know cheeses are commonly smoked, but that's a cold-smoke, rather than a hot-smoke like barbecue.

My 3.4 pound butt should take 5 hours or so? The ribs 3-4 hours? Since i cant access the ribs in the smoker without removing the butt and losing a lot of heat opening it up, I think i have to pull the ribs and the butt at the same time. I'm thinking to make this work logistically, I'm going to bake the butt in the oven in the hour to get it going and then put the butt and the ribs in the smoker together at the same time.

A friend made a brisket and a couple weeks later I had some wine with a girlfriend, which equals sassy mischief. He told me to make my own brisket, and of course I responded with \"I will, and it'll be better than yours\". Which led into days of smack talking, which grew into a challenge, spread to several friends, and became a war. \n\n  \nWinner gets a t-shirt and a crown from the other person, not to mention serious bragging. I then realized I'd never made a brisket, started researching, and $1200 later I had a Weber Smoky Mountain Cooker Smoker, a bunch of gear and a half brisket to do a test run. It's fueled by charcoal and wood chips. I decided to do a test brisket (half of one) a few weeks ago. It tasted good and had a nice bark, but the feedback from friends was it was a little dry and not as tender as my opponents.\n\n  \nThe Brisket war is this Saturday (April 26) and I have a 30 lb. brisket I plan to brine tonight (Wednesday), then add dry rub tomorrow night (Thursday), and start smoking Friday at noon to be done by Saturday when it's good and ready, then rest for 2-3 hours. Below, I listed what I did for my test brisket and am looking for advice to make this the brisket that earns me a crown (not a tiara, a dang crown). \n\nTest Brisket Steps I used last time, but I NEED to improve this for juiciness and tenderness:  \nNight before: trimmed fat and applied a dry rub of coarse salt, pepper, and garlic. Put trimmed fat and bacon grease in a crock pot overnight until fully melted, then strained through a cheese cloth (tallow).   \nMorning at 5am: Removed brisket from fridge to rest on counter for 2 hours.  Started smoker with charcoal and wood chips.    \n7am: Injected brisket with tallow and placed in smoker. \n\nSmoked brisket for 11 hours. After the first 3 hours I started to spray it every 45-60 minutes with a mix of Worcestershire, coffee, and water to create a nice bark. \\*\\*\\*I had A LOT of difficulty getting the temperature of the smoker up to 225, it was cooked at 180 for the majority of this process. At about 5 hours, it stalled.   \n\\-I removed the brisket and wrapped in butcher paper, then put back in the smoker. Continued to struggle to get heat past 180. I cooked it for another 4 hours while wrapped, still struggling to get temperature past 180.  \n\nI started really laying on wood chips and cardboard to get a better flame and got the heat up to 215. Unwrapped brisket and cooked 2 more hours until it finally reached internal temp of 202. Removed from the smoker and left wrapped on the counter for an hour before slicing. It did have a great bark, just a bit salty in my opinion but others liked it. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Major concerns: \n\n1. How do I make it juicier and fall apart tender? \n\n2. Am I missing something in this process?\n\n3. How do I get the heat of the smoker up or is it okay to plan on cooking it longer at the lower temp of 180? With a 30lb brisket (pre-trim) how many hours should I plan?\n\n5. Should I inject more than once, or just once prior to putting in the smoker?\n\n6. What is the best way to rest a brisket? I heard sticking it in a cooler tends to make it tougher as it continues to cook with the trapped heat. \n\n7. Any recommendations of charcoal briquettes and wood chips? I didn't have a charcoal chimney starter, so I spread them along the bottom and topped with wood chips. Had to refill every couple hours, but really struggled to keep heat of smoker up. \n\nAny and all advice would be appreciated.

I'm being offered a Masterbuilt Gravity Series 800 as a gift(this is a corporate reward thing and I have other gifts to choose from, but this is one of the higher value gifts and one of three items being offered that I'd actually use).  Having never used one, I can see it's a completely different style of smoker and appears to be easy to manage (light the lump in the hopper and it's managed by electronics afterwards).  It also comes with a griddle surface, which is kind of cool, but it's not like I can't simulate that on the egg.   \n\nI don't really have a need for two smokers that I can think of (I can fit enough racks of ribs on the BGE to get me through most parties), so what are some positives or negatives of the Gravity Series 800 from anyone with experience?

Is there something it does so much better than the egg that would be a compelling reason to get one to run in parallel with my egg (I'm not ditching the egg regardless)?

{"title": "Standing rib roast discussion", "selftext": "This group dragged me hard once when I inquired about injecting a standing rib roast. Today I come at you with another (as far as I can tell) unconventional way to cook a standing rib roast. First I salted it the night before cooking. There was no other seasoning involved. I cooked it at around 230\u00b0-250\u00b0 till the internal temperature was 130\u00b0. I pulled it tented it and let it rest for 10 minutes. It was a 6lb roast and I sliced it into 5 roughly even thick slices. Here comes the unconventional part. Than I took it back out and seared the slices for about 3 minutes per side. The slices that were on the end I only seared the end side of the slice for about a minute. Everyone agreed this was an improvement over the standard method of just slicing and serving. The thought to do this hit me as I was thinking that a standing roast and a ribeye are the same hunk of meat just cut differently. Is this something anyone else has done?

Would love some assistance in pickup my a smoker and have a few requirements that make it a little tricky. \nBack in the day we had a smallish medium sized traeger smoker which I loved and used alllll the time by myself. It was great. I never tried brisket back then but was excellent for chicken. We used it for a good amount of time and then we moved overseas so we sold it. When we came back, we bought a much larger Louisiana grill smoker and to be honest I haven\u2019t liked this thing from day one. It\u2019s way bigger and hard for me to lift the handle. I\u2019m short with a bad shoulder so it hasn\u2019t been great cooking on it. I literally have no joy using this thing. It has so many hot and cold spots and it\u2019s had several temperature control issues. I don\u2019t know if I got a dud, but I don\u2019t wanna deal with it anymore.  \nMy husband casually cooks a brisket for me a few times a year, and the results now aren\u2019t  consistent. It\u2019s such a bummer and it makes him not wanna cook anymore because half the time the temperature drops off, or sears to 425\u00b0.  \nBudget? I would love to be around $500-$750. Would be hard to swing anymore than that, but I realize I don\u2019t know how much good grills cost.  \nI would love an electric/pellet smoker as I am familiar with that.

Developed a good bark and it stalled at about 150 for a maybe a couple hours. I decided to foil boat once I thought the bark was set at about 170. Went until 7:30pm and pulled it at about 200 degrees and some spots felt probe tender and others a little resistance. Now a couple things that may have done it. Early in the cook I was running about 225-250 and towards the end I was running 300. Had some pretty good temp swings during the cook. The flat came out mostly dry and the point came out not fully rendered and was super chewy, pretty inedible. It had a good bark but the inside was not it. I don\u2019t know if it was the temp swings or if I just pulled too early or if I should have wrapped it. Luckily I got it for free but still bummed it didn\u2019t come out good.

{"title": "I Almost Killed My Brisket (and Maybe My Family)", "selftext": "This was supposed to be the brisket.\n\nI had the plan. I had the snake. I had the tallow. I was ready.\n\nStarted with a 15 lb packer on my Weber Kettle Saturday afternoon. Used lump charcoal (mistake #1), and things started out beautifully\u2014bark forming, smoke rolling, vibes immaculate. I even felt like I was ahead of schedule.\n\nThen the lump went rogue. Temps spiked like I\u2019d tossed jet fuel in there. Fire out of control. It was around 6 PM when I pivoted hard\u2014wrapped the brisket and tossed it in the oven at 250\u00b0F. I told myself: \u201cJust coast it to 202\u00b0F and then let it rest.\u201d\n\nIt hit temp around 1 AM. Probed like butter. I was exhausted. Proud. Confident.\nSo I did the one thing no pitmaster should ever do:\n\nI left it unwrapped on the counter.\n\nJust for a bit, I told myself. I\u2019d wrap it soon. I\u2019d let it cool a little. Then I fell asleep.\n\nCut to: 6 AM.\nBrisket is temping 94\u00b0F.\nUnwrapped. Naked. Vulnerable. Sitting on my stovetop like a forgotten offering.\n\nThat\u2019s 5+ hours in the food safety danger zone, exposed to air, unsealed. USDA guidance might as well have been screaming in my head. I felt like I had committed a holy offense against the brisket gods.\n\nI panicked. Then I Googled. Then I panicked more.\n\nEventually, I did what any desperate man would do:\n\t\u2022\tWrapped it tight in foil\n\t\u2022\tAdded tallow like a priest anointing a last rite\n\t\u2022\tReheated it to 165\u00b0F\n\t\u2022\tHeld it in the oven at 150\u00b0F for a few hours\n\t\u2022\tAnd then\u2014against every warning I had just read\u2014I served it to my family\n\nThey trusted me. They didn\u2019t know the drama this meat had been through.\nThey didn\u2019t know we were all sharing a brisket born of fire and questionable judgment.\n\nThe result?\n\nFlat was dry. Bark was soft.\nBut the flavor? Shockingly still there.\nThe point? Tender and rich.\nEveryone went back for seconds.\nI watched my family chew in slow motion, waiting for someone to faint. Instead, I got compliments.\nThis brisket almost ended me. It may have ended my family.\nBut it also made me better.\n\nI won\u2019t make the same mistakes again. \n\nBrisket.

I almost gave up and went back to brisket.\n\nBut last weekend, I gave it one more go\u2014and man, it was a game-changer. I actually took the time to trim the fat properly, let the ribs sit with a dry rub for a few hours, and slow-roasted them in the oven instead of trying to grill them fast (big mistake before). The result? Deep bark, juicy meat, and that melt-in-your-mouth bite I was chasing.\n\nThe recipe that helped me finally get it right was surprisingly simple but super detailed.

I know I could go for the Typhur with 2 probes also, but I'd like 4. While browsing, I found the ThermoMaven P4 (Amazon link below) that is just over half the price of the Typhur while having very similar features. I found (mostly via Reddit) that the mother company is Typhur, and they might use similar technology. \n\nNevertheles, other than Amazon, I can barely find this product elsewhere. On Amazon, most of the reviews are positive, but I find it suspicious that they mostly are too positive. I did find a few reviews on YouTube, but they are from unknown channels and generally pretty short. The few Reddit mentions are generally overusing the name of the manufacturer, which could be a tactic for having this show up in search results.\n\nTo sum it all up, the product looks good, and I can always return it if I purchase it from Amazon. It does, however, look suspicious (to me, at least) because of the lack of reviews or reviews and comments that might be bots. Am I paranoid? Did anyone else try this product?

{"title": "What I've Learned After 5 Years", "selftext": "I'm 5 years into my smoking journey and would like to share what I've learned:\n\n  \n**Smoker:** I started with a Traeger Timberline 850 and have also acquired a Chud Box and have now graduated into a Mill Scale 94. I have since gotten ride of the Traeger. In my opinion pellet grills vs offsets, you can make great BBQ with either. I learned a lot with the Traeger and wish I still had it. With the convenience of it, I would use it a lot more and it was more versatile. The Chud Box has been great, I make the best ribs and 1/2 chickens over the Mill Scale and Traeger. It is no where near as versatile as the Traeger or Mill Scale but serves it's purpose. The Mill Scale is definitely King but has it's drawbacks, it is quite the commitment to use and I use it much less than my Traeger. I live in a Northern State and to get smoking wood, I often spend more on the wood for the cook than anything else.\n\n  \n**Temperatures:** When I started with the Traeger, I tried to keep the temp as low as possible (225F super smoke) to \"maximize the smoke flavor\". I learned it does not render fat as much and hotter is better in my opinion. You're never going to get the smoke flavor out of a pellet as an offset. I don't cook anything less than 275F any more. I think it renders fat better, makes a quicker cook and turns out a better product.\n\n  \n**Seasoning:** I've tried all the seasonings (Meat Church, Malcom Reed, Chuds, anything else I find), and I've found the best is plain old kosher salt and 16 mesh black pepper with maybe a little onion powder or garlic powder. With leftovers, I'd rather have salt/pepper pulled pork/brisket to make left over sandwiches or turn into tacos. It's much more versatile with salt/pepper and being able to see the actual result of the cook/meat, I've learned much more as it's not masked by anything else. If you want to use a different flavor, try different BBQ sauces and/or make your own sauce.\n\n  \n**Meats:** Costco has the best ribs/brisket that I've found. My favorite meats to purchase are spare ribs, whole chickens and large turkey breasts. I enjoyed cooking briskets and got it figured out but it's such a time commitment/cost I haven't done one in a while. Turkey breasts and chickens you can never go wrong with. I enjoy making ribs 1x a month but make the most meals out of turkey or chicken.\n\n  \n**Equipment:** A Thermapen is a necessity. I've had a Thermoworks Dot and Thermoworks Signals, these are both initially useful but after a while you'll understand temperature vs time and alls I need anymore is a Thermapen. Insulated gloves and a wire grid rack are a must.\n\n  \n**Cooking:** I'd much rather have my meat rest longer than being hurried to finish a cook with people waiting. For pork butts or briskets, I want them to rest for at least 2 hours before I plan on serving, chickens/turkey at least 45 mins. Stressing about finishing a cook with hungry people waiting, is not fun. I think the product is better the longer it rests any way. Start sooner than you think you need to,  you can always throw your oven on it's lowest setting and hold your meat for however long you want.\n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1ke9loh/what_ive_learned_after_5_years/", "created_utc": 1746326218.0, "score": 71, "author": "JuniorBonnet", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/smoking/comments/1ke9loh/what_ive_learned_after_5_years/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

However when I was at Costco recently they had two pre-trimmed prime flats priced as whole brisket...so I grabbed them both because I have trouble passing up a bargain (plus I figured having a couple small 6ish pound briskets in the freezer wouldn't be a bad idea).\n\nSo here's what I'm looking at: this weekend we're going to a friend's place for a bbq around noon. My wife asked if I could smoke one of the flats and of course I say yes (I'm almost never in a better mood than when I have my smoker going). \n\nThe flat I'm going to smoke is just a hair over 6.5 pounds. I've already taken it out of the freezer to defrost and it's sitting in the fridge. BBQ is on Saturday.\n\nSo...how would you (more or less) time your smoke? I've done smokes where I start the packer the night before and let it take on a good bark at a lower temp before wrapping/pumping the temp first thing in the morning. However I'm guessing that if I try that with this flat I'm going to end up with dry roast beef.\n\nI know that there isn't a science to the timing (for me much more about internal temp/if the external temp probe goes in like a hot knife in butter) but I guess a general time range/strategy for this one would be really helpful.\n\nI'm guessing just \"wake up really early and get it on the smoker\" is going to be the way to go - but wanted to get some other opinions vs just winging it.\n\nThanks for any/all advice!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1kcjvpo/question_about_brisket_timing_just_trying_to_get/", "created_utc": 1746134154.0, "score": 2, "author": "Maximus3311", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/smoking/comments/1kcjvpo/question_about_brisket_timing_just_trying_to_get/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "First and Second Brisket", "selftext": "Hi, just saw this sub.\n\nI've wanted to try smoking for a bit and the weather got a bit better here so my roomate agreed they'd get the meat if I got the foil and smoke stuff. \n\nWe live in an apartment that provides Propane grills and won't allow us to use a smoker or charcoal grill on campus. Don't know why but whatever. \n\nSo I looked up as much as I could and found out getting smoking pellets and wrapping them in foil before poking some holes for the smoke to come out can work. \n\nIt was one whole 8.45lb brisket I just eyeballed it and cut it in half so it was basically 1 half being the flat and 1 half being some flat and the point. \n\n1st victim was the flat. Started cooking at 1500 or so, propane indirect heat, pellets on, brisket rubbed 3 nights before and wrapped in plastic wrap (it was supposed to be overnight but we had a medical issue) \n\nEnded up unwrapped and raised to room temp that afternoon and put on the left of the grill with the 2 burners under it off. And the other two on the right with the pellets set to about medium. \n\nSeemed like it sent fine. I had hiccups like not realizing I needed water to quench the smoking/flaming at times pellets, my phone dying, my roomates phone dying, and a hellacious wind bothering us. Ended up cooking in about 4 hours total tracked via thermoprobe wired. \n\nAt 165 I put a foil \"boat\" under it and tented it. Til 200 and the pulled and rested it. \n\nThe whole thing looked wet on top and when it was resting/cooking in its boat it was flooded with juice. \n\nThe brisket ended up very tough, very dry, and very salty. So... a fail.\n\n\n\n\nSecond round! This half had to be frozen then thawed due to time constraints. After it was fully thawed it was rubbed with a new mix of brown sugar, Chipotle powder, chili powder, way less sea salt, a good amount of fresh black pepper, cumin, powdered sage. \n\nIt got taken out after 12 hours wrapped in plastic and we attempted to start it but it started raining. Due to moving it around on the grill and transferring it I used pre-made spicy/sweet pork rub we had in the cabinet to fill the gaps since the rub I made I threw the extra away. \n\nIt then sat in the fridge just on a tray naked for a day. Next day starting at 1400 at roughly 40\u00b0 internal via probe it got put on.\n\nIt was windy *again* and I was also having trouble with my smoke pouches not combusting.  I kinda rush heated them when I noticed I couldn't smell smoke and opened a pouch at 125 to see the pellets were fresh and unburned.  \n\nTurned the flame up to get 2 pouches to smoke thinking it could compensate. Once they were smoking I turned the heat back down and closed the lid again because I didn't want the increased heat to effect the brisket. \n\nThings went okay. Ended up ashing out 3 pellet pouches by 153 leaving one left on the top rack kinda doing it's thing. That one died at 165.\n\nTemp was still rising at roughly 1\u00b0/min and at 19:16 I wrapped it in foil since it had hit 170 not really because of temp or anything. Wrapped it tight and set it to go and .. it set at 170.. for basically an hour. The last one didn't do this but I knew a stall was coming. But I also figured it wouldn't be too bad. \n\nBut nope about an hour later I was like \"okay this is breaking the laws of thermodynamics! (Not really but I was confused) so added another layer of foil to help trap more heat... didn't work. Turned indirect heat up full blast... didn't work. Moved the brisket to the lower part of the direct heat (it's a weird grill the big flames are in the back and the front is kinda small) still didn't raise it. Finally turned another set of flames on and turned *them* on and it broke 170! Unfortunately at 183 my temp probe screamed 243 357 438 HHH when I checked what the heck if I had like.. lit my brisket on fire. No... just the wire to the thermoprobe. The metal insulation hadn't helped it neither had it being several inches from the flame going up. \n\nSo I had to remove the probe. Tight wrap it. Decided to kill the third flame and turn the other two down and move the brisket back a bit. Gave it another 25 minutes and then pulled it. \n\nStored it wrapped in the oven (off) for 45 minutes then sliced it. I... think I sliced it wrong? With the lumpy part of the point to my left I sliced vertically going towards it from the right with the first few slices being mostly fat and... tough+juicy tough as in it was a bit chewy and you couldn't slice it with a fork. \n\nI want back and started slicing from the bottom up and these pieces were tender/soft/Flavorful. \n\nHaven't cut all the way through it and I suck at identifying grain patterns after meat is cooked. But I'm assuming the very back where the lump of the point is is tough because it was closest to the direct flame and/or I cut it wrong. \n\n\n\nAnyway that's my story. I have time-marks and temps etc but I figured that's more nerdy than I need to be here. \n\nBasically the first one(flat im assuming) cooked in about 4 hours and sucked. There was a slight smoke ring. \n\nSecond one cooked from 14:00-21:00 and had about an hours stall at 170\u00b0F also i cooked my thermoprobe. There was no smoke ring \n\n\nIf anyone wants to share tips tricks etc lemme know.\n\nNo I can't get an actual smoker; I can't afford it and also don't have a place for it. \n\nI got a 40lb bag of smoking pellets from Sams Club for $13 and I make a \"burrito\" out of roughly 1.5-2 cups of pellets in heavy foil then poke holes in the top. \n\nThe apartment has 2 4 burner propane grills and free unlimited propane for residents with a bottom and top rack. That's what I have to use. They don't want charcoal in them and I had to get a note from the fire department saying pellet pouches were okay as long as I took care of it properly.\n\nIm also looking for sides. I tried brussel sprouts wrapped in foil with butter salt and pepper for the first one just wrapped and holes poked(top rack over brisket). Turned out good tasting but roomate didn't like the texture. Also potatoes poked with a skewer all over, then rubbed with salt and butter and wrapped in foil with a hunk of butter(top rack over fire). They turned out great and crispy. Second try I did frozen asparagus in a foil pouch with a bunch of butter, salt, whole cloves of garlic, and lemon pepper with a hunk of parmesan cheese (top rack over brisket) and they turned out awful. No taste of seasoning at all, cheese didn't melt, garlic didn't roast, super mushy.

A friend made a brisket and a couple weeks later I had some wine with a girlfriend, which equals sassy mischief. He told me to make my own brisket, and of course I responded with \"I will, and it'll be better than yours\". Which led into days of smack talking, which grew into a challenge, spread to several friends, and became a war. \n\n  \nWinner gets a t-shirt and a crown from the other person, not to mention serious bragging. I then realized I'd never made a brisket, started researching, and $1200 later I had a Weber Smoky Mountain Cooker Smoker, a bunch of gear and a half brisket to do a test run. It's fueled by charcoal and wood chips. I decided to do a test brisket (half of one) a few weeks ago. It tasted good and had a nice bark, but the feedback from friends was it was a little dry and not as tender as my opponents.\n\n  \nThe Brisket war is this Saturday (April 26) and I have a 30 lb. brisket I plan to brine tonight (Wednesday), then add dry rub tomorrow night (Thursday), and start smoking Friday at noon to be done by Saturday when it's good and ready, then rest for 2-3 hours. Below, I listed what I did for my test brisket and am looking for advice to make this the brisket that earns me a crown (not a tiara, a dang crown). \n\nTest Brisket Steps I used last time, but I NEED to improve this for juiciness and tenderness:  \nNight before: trimmed fat and applied a dry rub of coarse salt, pepper, and garlic. Put trimmed fat and bacon grease in a crock pot overnight until fully melted, then strained through a cheese cloth (tallow).   \nMorning at 5am: Removed brisket from fridge to rest on counter for 2 hours.  Started smoker with charcoal and wood chips.    \n7am: Injected brisket with tallow and placed in smoker. \n\nSmoked brisket for 11 hours. After the first 3 hours I started to spray it every 45-60 minutes with a mix of Worcestershire, coffee, and water to create a nice bark. \\*\\*\\*I had A LOT of difficulty getting the temperature of the smoker up to 225, it was cooked at 180 for the majority of this process. At about 5 hours, it stalled.   \n\\-I removed the brisket and wrapped in butcher paper, then put back in the smoker. Continued to struggle to get heat past 180. I cooked it for another 4 hours while wrapped, still struggling to get temperature past 180.  \n\nI started really laying on wood chips and cardboard to get a better flame and got the heat up to 215. Unwrapped brisket and cooked 2 more hours until it finally reached internal temp of 202. Removed from the smoker and left wrapped on the counter for an hour before slicing. It did have a great bark, just a bit salty in my opinion but others liked it. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Major concerns: \n\n1. How do I make it juicier and fall apart tender? \n\n2. Am I missing something in this process?\n\n3. How do I get the heat of the smoker up or is it okay to plan on cooking it longer at the lower temp of 180? With a 30lb brisket (pre-trim) how many hours should I plan?\n\n5. Should I inject more than once, or just once prior to putting in the smoker?\n\n6. What is the best way to rest a brisket? I heard sticking it in a cooler tends to make it tougher as it continues to cook with the trapped heat. \n\n7. Any recommendations of charcoal briquettes and wood chips? I didn't have a charcoal chimney starter, so I spread them along the bottom and topped with wood chips. Had to refill every couple hours, but really struggled to keep heat of smoker up. \n\nAny and all advice would be appreciated.

{"title": "Identifying grill leaks with dry ice", "selftext": "Hadn\u2019t seen anyone do this so I figured I would post.\n\nNOTE: Obviously, be careful when handling dry ice. If you are going to use this to identify leaks below the charcoal grate, use hot water, or it won\u2019t take long before the water starts freezing around the dry ice, encasing it and reducing the output significantly. You can also increase the amount of sublimation by using smaller chunks of dry ice to create more surface area.\n\nThis is an SNS grill I assembled and cooked on yesterday. Im confident I can add a lava lock gasket for the rim and use high temp rtv to create a gasket for the smoke hole, but if you have any tips for what I can do about the bottom air control I\u2019d be very appreciative. I\u2019ve tried bending them slightly to create a better seal prior to doing this test. I\u2019ve seen elsewhere people recommend simply cooking more on it to build up some sludge, but I\u2019m not especially convinced. It just seems strange that the grill requires maintaining a specific amount of poor hygiene to be effective. I\u2019m not above it, but I have 30 days to get my money back on this thing to pursue other options, and if I\u2019m going to do that I\u2019d rather not have to disassemble this grill after caking it over in grime and dapping it up with RTV. \n\nSide note: it\u2019s kinda ironic because I got this to replace a weber kettle that had the opposite problem, bottom vents getting choked out with debris", "url": "https://v.redd.it/uucei6991nwe1", "created_utc": 1745437321.0, "score": 0, "author": "selkus_sohailus", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/smoking/comments/1k68ctn/identifying_grill_leaks_with_dry_ice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Standing rib roast discussion", "selftext": "This group dragged me hard once when I inquired about injecting a standing rib roast. Today I come at you with another (as far as I can tell) unconventional way to cook a standing rib roast. First I salted it the night before cooking. There was no other seasoning involved. I cooked it at around 230\u00b0-250\u00b0 till the internal temperature was 130\u00b0. I pulled it tented it and let it rest for 10 minutes. It was a 6lb roast and I sliced it into 5 roughly even thick slices. Here comes the unconventional part. Than I took it back out and seared the slices for about 3 minutes per side. The slices that were on the end I only seared the end side of the slice for about a minute. Everyone agreed this was an improvement over the standard method of just slicing and serving. The thought to do this hit me as I was thinking that a standing roast and a ribeye are the same hunk of meat just cut differently. Is this something anyone else has done? I have never seen it in any rib roast recipes. Have I inspired you to try this on your next rib roast.

It also comes with a griddle surface, which is kind of cool, but it's not like I can't simulate that on the egg.   \n\nI don't really have a need for two smokers that I can think of (I can fit enough racks of ribs on the BGE to get me through most parties), so what are some positives or negatives of the Gravity Series 800 from anyone with experience?  It's not hard to guess that it will be less durable than the egg, and easier to manage cooks (I have no plan to invest in a Billows or comparable product at this time), but what else is there?  Is there something it does so much better than the egg that would be a compelling reason to get one to run in parallel with my egg (I'm not ditching the egg regardless)?

Would love some assistance in pickup my a smoker and have a few requirements that make it a little tricky. \nBack in the day we had a smallish medium sized traeger smoker which I loved and used alllll the time by myself. It was great. I never tried brisket back then but was excellent for chicken. We used it for a good amount of time and then we moved overseas so we sold it. When we came back, we bought a much larger Louisiana grill smoker and to be honest I haven\u2019t liked this thing from day one. It\u2019s way bigger and hard for me to lift the handle. I\u2019m short with a bad shoulder so it hasn\u2019t been great cooking on it. I literally have no joy using this thing. It has so many hot and cold spots and it\u2019s had several temperature control issues. I don\u2019t know if I got a dud, but I don\u2019t wanna deal with it anymore.  \nMy husband casually cooks a brisket for me a few times a year, and the results now aren\u2019t  consistent. It\u2019s such a bummer and it makes him not wanna cook anymore because half the time the temperature drops off, or sears to 425\u00b0.  \nBudget? I would love to be around $500-$750. Would be hard to swing anymore than that, but I realize I don\u2019t know how much good grills cost.  \nI would love an electric/pellet smoker as I am familiar with that. Open to other systems if just as easy. \n\n BIGGEST factors:\nNeed ease of use. Electric pellet have been easy for me. I don\u2019t want a complicated set up that I have to constantly be checking, adjusting, adding. \nI understand that I have to learn my grill and figure out those weird spots, but I don\u2019t want the whole face of the thing riddled with those. \nI also understand that the bigger the grill, the harder it might be to open, but I wouldn\u2019t mind so much if the results turned out great. \nI would like to smoke two whole chickens together once a week, and my dream would be briskets/other time intensive meats once every three months. \nThank you so much in advance!

Early in the cook I was running about 225-250 and towards the end I was running 300. Had some pretty good temp swings during the cook. The flat came out mostly dry and the point came out not fully rendered and was super chewy, pretty inedible. It had a good bark but the inside was not it.

Both dampers are wide open. I know it may not be the most accurate thermometer but I thought erring on the high side since it's near the top might mean 250F = 225F at grate level but I'm kinda shocked at how low the temp is inside the ribs. It should be like 195-200 by now right? \n\nSide note the flavor on the exterior when I poke it and lick my finger is one of the best things I've ever tasted so I've got the clean smoke on point at least. \n\nSeems like the meat temp and the amount of coals I've burned through are rookie fails. Should I pull the ribs and eat them or try to raise the temp further? And why am I burning so many coals?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/g3dlignvp2we1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745191347.0, "score": 0, "author": "SammichParade", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/smoking/comments/1k3zcyo/ribs_have_been_on_for_just_over_5_hours_they_look/", "html_title": ""}
