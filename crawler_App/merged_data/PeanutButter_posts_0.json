One that does not slide off the banana before I could take my first bite. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "url": "https://i.redd.it/w7np6h3c40zc1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1715086372.0, "score": 167, "author": "CatfromLongIsland", "num_comments": 158, "permalink": "/r/PeanutButter/comments/1cmb6ri/not_a_fan_of_trader_joes_creamy_unsalted_peanut/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Ohio Peanut Butter Buckeyes (revised recipe)", "selftext": "So, the traditional recipe of like 3-cups of confectioners sugar, 1-cup PB, stick of butter was just cloyingly sweet even if dipped in super dark chocolate. Only problem is that the sugar is structural. Add too little and they stay mushy/gloopy even when chilled. So I needed to up the PB flavor and diminish the sweetness while giving it structure. \n\nNew recipe uses the shelf stable hydrogenated (yes, hydrogenated, just don\u2019t eat these every week) veg oil in PB chips. It\u2019s super stable at room temp and adds some sweetness and more PB. \n\nSo this recipe uses a bag of Reese\u2019s PB chips, 2 cups of PB, 1/2 cup dehydrated PB powder (in the US \u201cPB2\u201d), and 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  Gently melt PB.  Like just barely liquidy. Add the PB chips. Stir to melt the chips and also to bring down the temp of the PB. Add the PB powder and sugar. Mix.\n\nFor crispy mouth feel, feuilletine is great but too hard to make. So I substituted good quality store bought ice cream cones (traditional kind, like Dutch waffle cones) lightly broken up. Added all that to KitchenAid to mix. Scooped out with spring loaded scooper. Chilled in fridge. \n\nI used the cheat method for tempering the chocolate.  Guittard extra dark chocolate chips. Nuke on 20 second cycles until just starting to melt. Rest. Stir. Do NOT over heat. Just barely melted. Around 100\u00b0f/38\u00b0c.  \n\nSeparately, finely FINELY chop (almost shaved) a 100g bar of 85% bittersweet (Lindt) chocolate. Once the chocolate is just melted, add the shaved dark chocolate. It\u2019ll recrystalize the cocoa butter to give it that snap.  \n\nDip. Tray. Fridge. Eat.

{"title": "Justin's PB - Review", "selftext": "As a fellow peanut butter lover occasionally I'll try out a brand that is outside of the norm of the Skippy, Jif, Peter Pan. Sometimes they're good, sometimes I just don't get the point. \n\nI actually got this as a gift... someone who knows I love peanut butter! It appears to be a bit of a higher end brand as it's priced above the staples. \n\nFirst things first... it's runny. \n\nOK, I've had experience with peanut butter that doesn't use hydrogenated oils. That's fine. It needs a little stir. It's supposed to be \"better\", right? It says non-GMO. Pollinator friendly. That must ensure that they're really trying here...\n\nWell, it tastes like... well, nothing. It's a little gritty. A little peanutty. But really, it feels oily. Mostly without flavor. That's because I found that the typical added salt, sugar and occasional molasses have been omitted. OK, it must strive to be a healthier, bougie brand. The kind people pick up at Whole Foods holding a $7 coffee. I can fuck with that, maybe. Sure...\n\nSo with the omitted ingredients, you're left with peanuts and... wtf? Palm oil. One of the trashiest oils on the market. A low rent, environmentally unsustainable product that, really, I've only found with any regularity in Dollar Store food. \n\nSo we've ditched ALL the flavor and used an oil that is used as the primary component of biodiesel fuel. But that's not all. \n\nWith all of this strange formulation, at least the peanut content has got to be top tier... right? No. This clearly CANNOT be marketed as peanut butter due to the slightly smaller \"spread\" underneath the words \"peanut butter\". It can't be peanut butter if it's less than 90% peanuts. It's just a \"spread\". Justin's is not even true peanut butter and it doesn't come with the bonus of being \"honey roasted\". \n\nSo, not only does it have a reduced peanut content over commercial brands, it costs a bit more. Not only did it eliminate salt and sugar, but it effectively increased the crappy palm oil level to the point that it not only took over the place of those 2 other ingredients but it went FURTHER with it and disqualified this from even being a comparable product to budget-level Peter Pan. This has likely more oil than any PB on the market and it's not better for it. \n\nI don't understand the reason for this formulation. Maybe it's good for diabetics? Idk, is this keto friendly? But it's not delicious. And it's not peanut butter. It's a flavorless oily mess. \n\nGrade: D+.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hn81n9", "created_utc": 1735277863.0, "score": 110, "author": "alkie90210", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/PeanutButter/comments/1hn81n9/justins_pb_review/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Their peanut butter was always perfectly smooth.  That was not the issue.  My usual Teddie brand is a bit gritty thanks to bits of unground peanuts.  The issue with Trader Joe\u2019s brand was the peanut butter remained runny after being stirred and stored in the fridge (as shown in the last photo).  I drained 24 grams of oil that accumulated on the top of the second jar of peanut butter sitting in the pantry.  I stirred the remaining contents and refrigerated the jar.  The consistency is perfect!  Of course draining off the oil very slightly raises the per ounce cost of the peanut butter.  The final cost remains very affordable; the price is nothing outlandish like some of the brands I have seen. \n\nTrader Joe\u2019s is not a nearby store for me.

{"title": "PBCC Bar Update", "selftext": "Hi guys I posted in here a couple weeks ago about PBCC bar i would buy from a bakery and asked for recipe suggestions. Ive baked maybe 6 since then and the results have been really good! So i will share what I\u2019ve learned.\n\n\nThe recipe for the PB I tried with pb/condensed milk and using tube cookie dough from the store-the ratios with condensed milk:PB was bad, not nearly PB enough. Then i tried 1.5 cup PB, 1.5 cup powdered sugar, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract. IT IS VERY GOOD. It smells like butterfinger and after 4 more times i started thinking this is like the form of PB you want to use for confections. Hence, its often called confectioners sugar that makes perfect sense. \n\n\nSo i experimented with some homemade dough recipes and its pretty great. It goes how you would expect, spread dough in bottom, spread PB mix on top, but then instead of a full dough layer to seal it, \u201ccrumble\u201d the cookie dough onto the topNo different recipe than your usual fav chocolate chip cookie dough but maybe half, or thirnd, or even less chocolate chips. but if you want me to post mine I can.\n\n\nIn my last bake, I had some remaining dough and PB mixture, and just rolled them together into a couple cookies and it was just as good as the bar, possibly even better. Tonight I tried ripping off another bakery\u2019s delicious good, a chocolate cookie with PB filling. They are just out of the oven and dont look all that right, but probably will taste awesome too. It is the chocolate cookie recipe from the back of the reeses chips package that i kind of expect everyone here to be familiar with, flattened, drop in the same PB mix from above, and seal then roll into a ball.\n\n\nI was extremely impressed with this sub, i kept scrolling and telling my wife that after 20 years online, ive finally found my community.

I used roasted chicken flavor but I bet just about any of them would be great, especially the saut\u00e9ed onion. \n\nOnce the noodles are done strain them into a bowl but keep the cooking broth. Add a big spoonful of peanut butter (use the cheap stuff that has emulsifiers) and then ladle in some of the broth and mix. Keep adding a little of each until it reaches a consistency you\u2019re happy with, it\u2019ll be kinda sticky at first but should emulsify well. \n\nOnce the noodles are combined add whatever you have in the fridge that sounds good. I used a bunch of chili crisp, fried eggs and scallions since that\u2019s what I had, but leftover chicken or veggies would be perfect too.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/w6trjs9fvfve1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744914754.0, "score": 65, "author": "IBelongHere", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/PeanutButter/comments/1k1k3tr/peanut_butter_noodles_part_2/", "html_title": ""}

I only keep one jar stocked at a time, and typically will go through it within 1-2 weeks with 3 weeks being the longest.\n\nI was in my former apartment when this first started, and had been storing the jars in an overhead cupboard which was beside the microwave. I eventually stopped storing them there and moved them to a cupboard not next to appliances. In my new apartment, I just had jar go bad today that I've only had for 1 week. Currently I've been storing them on top of the fridge as this apartment has very limited storage and the only open area would be right besidge a microwave again.\n\nAny ideas what's going on here?

Funny enough, I didn\u2019t like wholemeal bread as a kid, but now I can\u2019t get enough of it, probably eating more than I should.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PeanutButter/comments/1iifh2h/anyone_else_prefer_wholemeal_bread_for_pb/", "created_utc": 1738776469.0, "score": 36, "author": "CejuOnline", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/PeanutButter/comments/1iifh2h/anyone_else_prefer_wholemeal_bread_for_pb/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "PBCC Bar Update", "selftext": "Hi guys I posted in here a couple weeks ago about PBCC bar i would buy from a bakery and asked for recipe suggestions. Ive baked maybe 6 since then and the results have been really good! So i will share what I\u2019ve learned.\n\n\nThe recipe for the PB I tried with pb/condensed milk and using tube cookie dough from the store-the ratios with condensed milk:PB was bad, not nearly PB enough. Then i tried 1.5 cup PB, 1.5 cup powdered sugar, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract. IT IS VERY GOOD. It smells like butterfinger and after 4 more times i started thinking this is like the form of PB you want to use for confections. Hence, its often called confectioners sugar that makes perfect sense. \n\n\nSo i experimented with some homemade dough recipes and its pretty great. It goes how you would expect, spread dough in bottom, spread PB mix on top, but then instead of a full dough layer to seal it, \u201ccrumble\u201d the cookie dough onto the topNo different recipe than your usual fav chocolate chip cookie dough but maybe half, or thirnd, or even less chocolate chips. but if you want me to post mine I can.\n\n\nIn my last bake, I had some remaining dough and PB mixture, and just rolled them together into a couple cookies and it was just as good as the bar, possibly even better. Tonight I tried ripping off another bakery\u2019s delicious good, a chocolate cookie with PB filling. They are just out of the oven and dont look all that right, but probably will taste awesome too. It is the chocolate cookie recipe from the back of the reeses chips package that i kind of expect everyone here to be familiar with, flattened, drop in the same PB mix from above, and seal then roll into a ball.\n\n\nI was extremely impressed with this sub, i kept scrolling and telling my wife that after 20 years online, ive finally found my community.

{"title": "Justin's PB - Review", "selftext": "As a fellow peanut butter lover occasionally I'll try out a brand that is outside of the norm of the Skippy, Jif, Peter Pan. Sometimes they're good, sometimes I just don't get the point. \n\nI actually got this as a gift... someone who knows I love peanut butter! It appears to be a bit of a higher end brand as it's priced above the staples. \n\nFirst things first... it's runny. \n\nOK, I've had experience with peanut butter that doesn't use hydrogenated oils. That's fine. It needs a little stir. It's supposed to be \"better\", right? It says non-GMO. Pollinator friendly. That must ensure that they're really trying here...\n\nWell, it tastes like... well, nothing. It's a little gritty. A little peanutty. But really, it feels oily. Mostly without flavor. That's because I found that the typical added salt, sugar and occasional molasses have been omitted. OK, it must strive to be a healthier, bougie brand. The kind people pick up at Whole Foods holding a $7 coffee. I can fuck with that, maybe. Sure...\n\nSo with the omitted ingredients, you're left with peanuts and... wtf? Palm oil. One of the trashiest oils on the market. A low rent, environmentally unsustainable product that, really, I've only found with any regularity in Dollar Store food. \n\nSo we've ditched ALL the flavor and used an oil that is used as the primary component of biodiesel fuel. But that's not all. \n\nWith all of this strange formulation, at least the peanut content has got to be top tier... right? No. This clearly CANNOT be marketed as peanut butter due to the slightly smaller \"spread\" underneath the words \"peanut butter\". It can't be peanut butter if it's less than 90% peanuts. It's just a \"spread\". Justin's is not even true peanut butter and it doesn't come with the bonus of being \"honey roasted\". \n\nSo, not only does it have a reduced peanut content over commercial brands, it costs a bit more. Not only did it eliminate salt and sugar, but it effectively increased the crappy palm oil level to the point that it not only took over the place of those 2 other ingredients but it went FURTHER with it and disqualified this from even being a comparable product to budget-level Peter Pan.

I only keep one jar stocked at a time, and typically will go through it within 1-2 weeks with 3 weeks being the longest.\n\nI was in my former apartment when this first started, and had been storing the jars in an overhead cupboard which was beside the microwave. I eventually stopped storing them there and moved them to a cupboard not next to appliances. In my new apartment, I just had jar go bad today that I've only had for 1 week.

Funny enough, I didn\u2019t like wholemeal bread as a kid, but now I can\u2019t get enough of it, probably eating more than I should.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PeanutButter/comments/1iifh2h/anyone_else_prefer_wholemeal_bread_for_pb/", "created_utc": 1738776469.0, "score": 39, "author": "CejuOnline", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/PeanutButter/comments/1iifh2h/anyone_else_prefer_wholemeal_bread_for_pb/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "PBCC Bar Update", "selftext": "Hi guys I posted in here a couple weeks ago about PBCC bar i would buy from a bakery and asked for recipe suggestions. Ive baked maybe 6 since then and the results have been really good! So i will share what I\u2019ve learned.\n\n\nThe recipe for the PB I tried with pb/condensed milk and using tube cookie dough from the store-the ratios with condensed milk:PB was bad, not nearly PB enough. Then i tried 1.5 cup PB, 1.5 cup powdered sugar, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract. IT IS VERY GOOD. It smells like butterfinger and after 4 more times i started thinking this is like the form of PB you want to use for confections. Hence, its often called confectioners sugar that makes perfect sense. \n\n\nSo i experimented with some homemade dough recipes and its pretty great. It goes how you would expect, spread dough in bottom, spread PB mix on top, but then instead of a full dough layer to seal it, \u201ccrumble\u201d the cookie dough onto the topNo different recipe than your usual fav chocolate chip cookie dough but maybe half, or thirnd, or even less chocolate chips. but if you want me to post mine I can.\n\n\nIn my last bake, I had some remaining dough and PB mixture, and just rolled them together into a couple cookies and it was just as good as the bar, possibly even better. Tonight I tried ripping off another bakery\u2019s delicious good, a chocolate cookie with PB filling. They are just out of the oven and dont look all that right, but probably will taste awesome too. It is the chocolate cookie recipe from the back of the reeses chips package that i kind of expect everyone here to be familiar with, flattened, drop in the same PB mix from above, and seal then roll into a ball.\n\n\nI was extremely impressed with this sub, i kept scrolling and telling my wife that after 20 years online, ive finally found my community.

{"title": "Justin's PB - Review", "selftext": "As a fellow peanut butter lover occasionally I'll try out a brand that is outside of the norm of the Skippy, Jif, Peter Pan. Sometimes they're good, sometimes I just don't get the point. \n\nI actually got this as a gift... someone who knows I love peanut butter! It appears to be a bit of a higher end brand as it's priced above the staples. \n\nFirst things first... it's runny. \n\nOK, I've had experience with peanut butter that doesn't use hydrogenated oils. That's fine. It needs a little stir. It's supposed to be \"better\", right? It says non-GMO. Pollinator friendly. That must ensure that they're really trying here...\n\nWell, it tastes like... well, nothing. It's a little gritty. A little peanutty. But really, it feels oily. Mostly without flavor. That's because I found that the typical added salt, sugar and occasional molasses have been omitted. OK, it must strive to be a healthier, bougie brand. The kind people pick up at Whole Foods holding a $7 coffee. I can fuck with that, maybe. Sure...\n\nSo with the omitted ingredients, you're left with peanuts and... wtf? Palm oil. One of the trashiest oils on the market. A low rent, environmentally unsustainable product that, really, I've only found with any regularity in Dollar Store food. \n\nSo we've ditched ALL the flavor and used an oil that is used as the primary component of biodiesel fuel. But that's not all. \n\nWith all of this strange formulation, at least the peanut content has got to be top tier... right? No. This clearly CANNOT be marketed as peanut butter due to the slightly smaller \"spread\" underneath the words \"peanut butter\". It can't be peanut butter if it's less than 90% peanuts. It's just a \"spread\". Justin's is not even true peanut butter and it doesn't come with the bonus of being \"honey roasted\". \n\nSo, not only does it have a reduced peanut content over commercial brands, it costs a bit more. Not only did it eliminate salt and sugar, but it effectively increased the crappy palm oil level to the point that it not only took over the place of those 2 other ingredients but it went FURTHER with it and disqualified this from even being a comparable product to budget-level Peter Pan. This has likely more oil than any PB on the market and it's not better for it. \n\nI don't understand the reason for this formulation. Maybe it's good for diabetics? Idk, is this keto friendly? But it's not delicious. And it's not peanut butter. It's a flavorless oily mess. \n\nGrade: D+.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hn81n9", "created_utc": 1735277863.0, "score": 111, "author": "alkie90210", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/PeanutButter/comments/1hn81n9/justins_pb_review/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
