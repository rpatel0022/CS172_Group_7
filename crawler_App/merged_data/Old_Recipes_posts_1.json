Definitely open to other ideas, I just can\u2019t stand the constant clogging up of the sub with the same exact content over and over and over.\n\nEDIT: folks I\u2019m not saying people can\u2019t share what they made. I\u2019m not saying it should stop, I\u2019m saying there has to be a better way.  Lemon Bars and murder cookies (to name a few repeat offenders) clog things up and make it hard to enjoy new content which should be priority. Nobody is saying people can\u2019t share. I\u2019m just old and grouchy so it may have seemed like that\u2019s what I was saying but it\u2019s not.

{"title": "New to the sub, anyone interested in old and kind of forgotten Italian recipes?", "selftext": "Hello all! I have just discovered this truly wonderful sub, and I fell in love with it! I so want to contribute!\nI am an Italian twentysomething with a passion for cooking and one of my hobbies is collecting older and not so known recipes and trying them.\nI was born and raised in Emilia-Romagna, so I am mostly knowledgeable of my local cuisine thanks to my amazing grandmas, but I am also learning and collecting a lot about upper Lombardy older cuisine, as my partner is from Bergamo and also loves trying out older and potentially forgotten foods. \n\nThis preamble is functional to asking whether anyone would be interested in getting old recipes from these areas of Italy? I see most posts in here are pictures of old cookbook recipes (and I love the vintage feeling they give), but mine would necessarily be translated texts from Italian originals, and they'd lose a little bit of charm to the eye. Let me know if someone is interested, and I will be happy to translate my most interesting finds!\n\nN.B.: I don't know if a post such as this goes against the rules of the sub, I hope this post falls within the 'discussion' flare. I'll gladly delete this post should it not belong here.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you all so, so much for the huge turn-up, and also for the awards. Really didn't expect such enthusiasm, but I am certainly happy to see it! I will do my best to not let anyone down and post interesting recipes :D\n\nEdit 2: I'm really positively speechless seeing the amount of people commenting on this post and saying they're interested in old and most likely hypercaloric Italian recipes! Thank you all, it is heartwarming. I'm editing to add this: I want to do a nice job sharing these recipes since so many of you are interested, I only want to specify that researching, converting measures and properly translating recipes will take some time, so I will likely post them one at a time periodically. Please do not expect them all together in one single gigapost, that's what I'm saying; also seeing as I am constantly discovering new ones! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/ghn1l6/new_to_the_sub_anyone_interested_in_old_and_kind/", "created_utc": 1589201809.0, "score": 2295, "author": "VanDeSpooks", "num_comments": 240, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/ghn1l6/new_to_the_sub_anyone_interested_in_old_and_kind/", "html_title": ""}

I've been sad lately, because of my mother's dementia and her decline, being somewhat estranged from my extended family for some time now, and some other relationship issues I won't delve into...but you bring me such comfort.\n\nMy grandmother passed away before I was born, but I grew up cooking with my mom. My family recipes are do dear to my heart, and make me feel connected to my ancestors. I am 44 and do not have siblings or a family of my own, and no one to pass these recipes onto. I also have long been a fan of older books, and look forward to sharing when I have my collection within my reach.\n\nThe deliciousness, the memories, comfort, and hilarity I've found here is priceless. I love sharing these moments with you all, and recreating new edible memories in my own home. Thank you dearly for this positive space. Things have been a bit rough lately, and you provide great healing to my bruised heart. Much love to you all...\n\n*Side note: Hopefully I'll have a family someday. Caring for my mother these past 7 years has caused me to delay...but I'd love to foster or adopt when I am able. I hope that someday, this will be a possibility.*\n\nEdit: Feb 15, 2020  Oh my goodness, all of the wonderful replies are nearly overwhelming! I haven't been on for 10 days and just came back to all of the comments! Thanks so much for your outpouring of love and kindness and support!

{"title": "Petition to the mods: Create a stickied post called \u201cRecipe of the Month\u201d where folks can share their Perok recipes without clogging everyone\u2019s feed", "selftext": "Fads come and go. Right now it\u2019s Perok, it used peanut butter, before that it was lemon bars, next month it will probably be something else.\n\nIt is understandable that people want to share their successes, and encourage each other! How wonderful! This is a lovely wholesome community that will help YOU make a Perok your Armenian mother in law would be proud of!!! \n\nBut as hard as it may be for some to believe, not everyone likes to scroll through dozens of pictures of Perok/lemon bars/insert fad here to get to more original content. It clogs up our feeds, and can get downright frustrating when you have to scroll through 7 Perok pictures to get to one original recipe.\n\nLuckily... there is a way to appease both sides. If we were to create a stickied post that highlighted the most trending recipe of that time, people could share their attempts and alterations to their Perok recipe without clogging  the feed and overstimulating everyone else who may not be a fan of Perok.\n\nThen when the Perok fad dies down, and is replaced by something else... just change the stickied post to highlight the NEW trending recipe. That way, everyone who wants to jump on the bandwagon can eagerly do so, get their fill of it, and anyone else who isn\u2019t interested, can more easily find new content.\n\nA happy medium is possible! It wouldn\u2019t take much effort and it would certainly make things better for everyone no matter which side of the Perok debate you\u2019re on. \n\nSimply scrolling through, and relying on individuals to add more original content to dilute the Perok, isn\u2019t a reasonable solution. There\u2019s been a toxic mindset toward discussion on this topic, and people have admitted to posting EVEN MORE Perok purely because they know it annoys other members of the community. This sort of behavior should never be tolerated, and is absolutely NOT the kind of wholesomeness that this sub strives for. Most people have responsibilities that take time away from their goal to become the next Martha Stewart and they reasonably just could not find enough old recipes to overpower the current fad. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of the Perok! The lemon bar huns cannot be stopped so easily!\n\nAll humor aside, I really think this is a suggestion in everyone\u2019s best interests, and hope it will be taken seriously. I would also remind critics that I am using the \u201cdiscussion\u201d post flair so this kind of post and other text-only posts are perfectly appropriate. \n\nHave a wonderful day and happy cooking!\n\nEdit: Just because it\u2019s an issue that you don\u2019t have a problem with, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not an issue worth addressing. I can\u2019t believe the amount of Karens going... \u201cWell I\u2019m fine with it, so everyone else should be too\u201d quite honestly that level of entitlement isn\u2019t acceptable past kindergarten. Let\u2019s learn to take a moment to understand other people\u2019s perspectives and make everyone feel heard.\n\nEdit 2: Ok, people are feeling triggered by my use of the word \u201cKaren\u201d in my first edit, and also feel that people aren\u2019t really diminishing the anti-Perok crowd, which would imply that this is blown out of proportion. I feel that the current 400+ upvotes this post has received in less than 8 hrs is worth noting, so I feel that there must be truth in what I\u2019m pointing out. \n\nAlso, if I delete the previous edit people will think I\u2019m trying to hide it. So instead, here\u2019s an additional edit to apologize if anyone felt attacked by the terminology I\u2019ve used. I\u2019ve responded earlier in the comments that I would post links to threads, but I also don\u2019t want to call out individuals specifically cause that\u2019s not cool by any standard, so I\u2019m stuck. However I will also note that I\u2019m not just referring to this particular thread but also the the one by u/elcarnioo where you can read the comments for yourself, as I have, and then scroll through the thread and find that the majority of comments seek to diminish the OP\u2019s frustrations by deeming this subject a non-issue, almost blaming OP for it a la \u201cWell if you posted more the Perok wouldn\u2019t be an issue\u201d like its their personal fault there isn\u2019t more diverse content on the subreddit. Adding smiley faces doesn\u2019t make it a kinder message, it just makes it appear passive aggressive. \n\nOnce again, I apologize for any divisiveness my diction has caused, but I do continue to maintain that cake is a legitimate issue on a subreddit for recipes, and one that should be taken seriously. \n\nLol I can\u2019t believe I literally had to write all that out.

It was probably produced for rather than by the owner, though it seems to include later additions in her own hand. If the dating to c. 1550 is accurate, it was likely part of her intended dowry, preparing a then teenage patrician woman for her future role as head of a wealthy household. Two similar works from the same city and time period survive, making comparison an promising exercise. One is the recipe book of Sabina Welser, a member of the same patrician family, which has [already been translated into English](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Sabrina_Welserin.html). The other belonged to one Maria Stengler and only survives in a [heavily normalised edition from the 19th century](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/fb05/germanistik/absprache/sprachverwendung/gloning/tx/stenglerin-kochbuch-1554.pdf).

{"title": "A Bustard Neck (15th c.)", "selftext": "Another short but interesting recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***243 Of a bustard\u2019s neck***\n\n***Fill the neck of a bustard or another bird this way: Take pork, hard-boiled eggs, sage, and herbs (kraut). Chop all of it together, fill the neck with that, and boil it. When it is boiled, lay it on a griddle while it is hot. Brush it with eggs or with an egg batter. Drizzle it with fat and with saffron and parsley and millet (?phenich). Grind that to a sauce (condiment) as best you can and serve it.***\n\nMany birds that people ate had long, flexible necks and cooks got creative in using them separately. This is one example of that: the neck of a bustard (Otis tarda) is stuffed with a herbed pork filling, roasted separately from the bird, and served as a dish in its own right. It is not quite clear what the baste consists of. Fat, saffron and parsley make sense as a yellow-green, flavourful liquid that would also stop the skin from drying out. The egg or egg batter would coat it from the outside, perhaps creating a crisp shell. The addition of *phenich* is a bit puzzling. As written, this could mean Italian millet (panicum). It is not easy to see how that would be included in the baste \u2013 as flour, cooked, or and entire grains? As ever, we cannot exclude the possibility of a scribal error. Perhaps, the solution is as easy as *hoenich* (honey). Still, it sounds like a fun idea to play with.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/29/a-stuffed-bustard-neck/", "created_utc": 1745952447.0, "score": 20, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1kavnff/a_bustard_neck_15th_c/", "html_title": "A Stuffed Bustard Neck | culina vetus"}

{"title": "Apple-Onion Sauce for Roast Goose (15th c.)", "selftext": "Today, just briefly, a recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS that resolves issues with a garbled one found in both sections of [Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf):\n\n***248 A dish of a goose***\n\n***Take a goose, stick it on a spit, and boil the innards. Take 4 hard-boiled eggs, a crumb of bread, caraway (or cumin \u2013 kummel) and a little pepper and saffron, and take 4 boiled chicken livers. Grind that together with vinegar and chicken broth (and cook it over) moderate fire. And peel onions, (cut) them thin and put them into a pot. Add fat and water and let them boil so they soften. Add 4 apples, so that it stays soft, and the put the ground ingredients and the apples and onions all into one pan. When the goose is roasted, cut it apart and put it into a clean serving bowl and (pour) the sauce over it. Serve it, do not oversalt it.***\n\nAnd thus we understand that the rather enigmatic [\u2018chicken pears\u2019 of both ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/01/roast-goose-in-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[recipes in Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/15/sauce-for-roast-goose-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) are actually a scribal error and the recipe calls for chicken broth. Now the sauce makes sense, though it still seems excessively complex. I\u2019m not quite ready to exclude the possibility that this recipe mashes together two or three alternatives.\n\nAs written, we have a sauce made with the cooked organ meats of the goose, chicken livers, breadcrumbs, hard-boiled eggs, onions, and apples. None of these are unusual in their own right. Meat, including roast liver, were often served in [sauces made with pureed cooked liver](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/21/another-liver-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/) that [could include onions](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/13/liver-and-onion-sauce-from-the-konigsberg-ms/). Sauces thickened with [ground-up hard-boiled eggs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/12/tripe-from-the-mondseer-kochbuch/) [and/or breadcrumbs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/16/garlic-and-horseradish-sauces/) are also commonplace, and those made with [onions or apples](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/03/polish-pike/), or more rarely both, feature especially later in the sixteenth century. All of them in one sauce is possible, and I should try it at some point. But is is equally possible that a lost original recipe described one or the other.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/27/apple-onion-sauce-for-roast-goose/", "created_utc": 1745780813.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k9bqjh/appleonion_sauce_for_roast_goose_15th_c/", "html_title": "Apple-Onion Sauce for Roast Goose | culina vetus"}
{"title": "Strawberry Swiss Roll", "selftext": "I was inspired by the other strawberry cake recipe posted. \n\nThis is a recipe I picked up from one of those 70s Era Grange cookbooks. I make for summer parties because it's easy, everyone loves it, and it looks a bit elegant. \n\nThe recipe has evolved over the years, so I'm not even sure how true it is to the original. \n\nCake.      \n\n3 eggs.     \n1 cup sugar.     \n1 cup flour.     \n1 tsp cream of tartar.       \n1/2 tsp baking soda.      \n1/3 cup cold water.      \n1 tsp vanilla.\n\nPreheat oven to 375. Oil bottom of a 10x13 pan. (Use a cookie sheet with 1/2\" sides. A little larger is fine.) Cover bottom with parchment paper (on top of the oil). \n\nIn mixing bowl, beat eggs, water, sugar and vanilla. Add dry ingredients. Makes a thin batter.    \n\nPour into pan. Cook about 15 minutes until center springs back. Do not overcook. Edges should not brown. \n\nRemove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Loosen edges with a knife. Cover the top with a clean kitchen towel. Flip out of pan so the towel is on the bottom. Remove parchment paper. The cake will still be warm. (If you cooked a smidgen too long, the edges will be crunchy. Trim them off.) \n\nStarting from the short end, roll the cake up, with the kitchen towel between. Rest with the end seam down. If the cake starts to crack, use a looser roll. This \"trains\" the cake to keep the roll as it cools.\n\n\n\nStrawberries (prep beforehand)       \n\n1 pt fresh strawberries.     \n2 tbsp sugar\n\nHull and cut strawberries into 1/4 or 1/8ths. Reserve 2-3 berries for garnish, if desired. Sprinkle with sugar. Chill for at least 1 hour. \n\nFilling (make while the cake bakes)       \n\n1 cup whipping cream.    \n1/4 cup cream cheese (The cream cheese stabilizes the whipped cream. If you want a richer, more mascarpone texture/flavor, use up to 1/2 cup.)         \n2 tbsp powdered sugar.     \n1 tsp vanilla.       \n\nAll the equipment should be very clean and cold.         \nWhip together cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Add whipping cream in 4 parts and beat until soft peaks form.     \n\nFold in strawberries a spoonful at a time. Leave the strawberry liquid until last, and add just enough so the filling doesn't get runny. \n\nCarefully unroll the cake and spread the filling on the cake. Re-roll it, seam side down. Chill until served. \n\nSprinkle with powdered sugar and garnish with strawberries (I slice in half and place them on top). \n\nDoes not keep well overnight, so eat it all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k8wls4/strawberry_swiss_roll/", "created_utc": 1745731740.0, "score": 98, "author": "rusty0123", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k8wls4/strawberry_swiss_roll/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "A Garbled Recipe | culina vetus", "selftext": "I am headed out to a medieval club event this weekend and have time, so it is just a brief recipe today. The Dorotheenkloster MS includes this gem:\n\n***213 For fritters in Lent***\n\n***Pound nut kernels and figs together in a mortar, spice it well, and rub it through a cloth with cinnamon flower and mix it with mustard. Stir it with liquid honey (so that it becomes) quite like wax beads (? wachs pert). And whenever you want to, take a little of that and rub it with wine. That way, you have mustard.***\n\nIt does not take long to realise that this is really two recipes, and we know at least the second one very well. The [instant honey mustard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/14/instant-honey-mustard-from-cgm-384-i/) that needs to be dissolved in wine for later use shows up in the [Munich Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf) collection:\n\n***12 Mustard***\n\n***For a good mustard, take mustardseed and dry it cleanly and then pound it in very small in a mortar. Then pass it through a tight cloth (and pound) cinnamon flower and mix it into the mustard and stir it together with honey, properly like beaten wax (?recht als der wachs bertt). If you wish (to serve it), take a little of this and rub it with wine, and you will have good mild mustard.***\n\nThe first half has parallels in both the Meister Hans collection (#114) and the [Rheinfr\u00e4nkisches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rheinfrankisches-Kochbuch.pdf) (#1), where it reads:\n\n***1 If you would make small fritters (kreppelin) in Lent, take nuts and figs and pound them small with each other and season it according to your will and heat it in oil and fry them in a leavened (erhabendem) dough in the way of dumpling-style fritters (kreppelin) in a pan and serve them cold at the table, those are well-tasting fritters***\n\nThere are notable parallels between the Dorotheenkloster MS and Meister Hans as well as other South German cookbooks, so this is not surprising. It appears a number of recipe collections circulated and were recombined at will. This particular error may have occurred when a scribe paused mid-recipe, then continued at the wrong point. It suggests the copyist was either not familiar with culinary matters, or just did not care.\n\n\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/24/a-garbled-recipe/", "created_utc": 1745521079.0, "score": 6, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k70anf/a_garbled_recipe_culina_vetus/", "html_title": "A Garbled Recipe | culina vetus"}

{"title": "A Multicoloured Confection (15th c.)", "selftext": "After Monday\u2019s post about colours, today it\u2019s the recipe that uses them all. Also from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***210 A strange baked/fried dish (gepachenes)***\n\n***For this, you must have all the colours. You must prepare a filling from each colour. Take wafers for that (dish) that are white, thin, and wide (scheyblat). For each (layer), take four wafers that must be seasoned with spices. With the white, you must add sugar to the four wafers. Spread a colour on it, but see there is not too much filling. Lay the four wafers over one another with the filling. Take another colour and spread it on four wafers as well, lay them together, and lay them atop the others that are written about before. Now take another colour and do the same with that, and lay them all atop each other so that each wafer is four over each other. If you have filled all wafers and think that it is too small when they all lie atop each other, begin again with the first filling and do what you did before. Then lay it all atop each other and lay it out on a table or a board. Weigh it down with the weight of two bricks and let it stand underneath this for a night, that way it turns firm and cool. It should be sweetened with sugar. Then you can serve it sweet, if you please, or keep it as long as you choose. When you want to serve it, take a sharp knife and slice it anyway you want. Lay it on a serving bowl, that way you weave (flechest) the colours. This is a baked/fried dish made without fire and you must have all seven colours. You must prepare them through the year.***\n\nThis recipe follows [Monday\u2019s list of food colours](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/21/making-food-colours/) and clearly is meant to go along with them. It is the ultimate way of showing off your whole collection. The description is a bit wordy, but it makes the principle clear: You take wafers, the thin, crisp kind [also used for filled fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/21/wafer-fritters/), and make a layer cake of colours. I think the intention is for one layer of each colour, with the phrase \u201clay them all atop each other\u201d referring to overlap on the edges, but that is guesswork. Either way, the result is liable to be intensely colourful and very decorative. After slicing through the dry, firm layers, the stripes of colour arranged on a serving dish would display to striking effect. A similar design is [also recorded in fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/07/filled-sheets-of-eggs-a-complex-fritter/) from other recipe collections.\n\nThe description of the dish as a *gepachenes* also highlights a feature of Middle German culinary terminology that can be confusing for modern readers. It tends to think from the result, not the technique. To a modern German, *backen* means baking, and even words like *Schmalzgeb\u00e4ck* can be confusing. In medieval terminology, it refers to both baking in ovens or baking dishes and to deep-frying in fat. Both achieved a dry, crisp consistency different from either roasting or boiling. Here, the same result \u2013 firm, crisp, dry \u2013 is achieved without any heat, so the word is used readily. Still, it is unusual enough to merit the description as *fremdes*, which can simply mean foreign or different, but carries overtones of unsual and astonishing. This was a dish to impress.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

It was called \"Rustic Mushroom Soup\" and my search lead me to think it was in the old 2006 readers digest publication \"Readers Digest: Ultimate Soup Cookbook\". Which the book has several mushrooms soup recipes. It doesn't seem have the one I'm looking for. I'm almost certain it was from some form of Readers Digest cookbook. We sadly lost the book it was in through several moves back in the day.\n\n**THE SOUP:**  \nRather than the typical opaque creaminess for mushrooms soups. It was a thinner brothy brown soup. More visually similar to French onion. It used multiple types of mushrooms (portobella, button, shitake, oyster, etc etc). It was well spiced and served over a slice of bread. Like the bread was placed in the bowl and the soup over top of it. Which apparently isn't common from my search.\n\nIf this sounds familiar to any of you please let me know. Any leads of any kind would be lovely.\n\nThank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k4vu2t/rustic_mushroom_soup_from_old_readers_digest/", "created_utc": 1745289734.0, "score": 57, "author": "TheSunWise", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k4vu2t/rustic_mushroom_soup_from_old_readers_digest/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Making Medieval Food Colouring (15th c.)", "selftext": "It has been a week without posts for which I apologise. I was rather busy. Today, finally, I am back at my desk with a new entry from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n208 Of all kinds of fritters\n\n***For fritters, you must have seven colours. You find them one after the other and must seek them out throughout the year. You find the first in summer: blue flowers. You must have a lot of them and dry them in an oven that is not too hot. When they are dry enough, pound them cleanly. Keep the colour, and prepare a puree (gem\u00fcs) of sloes and add the colour to that. That turns it blue. Add honey, that makes it sweet. Season it with good spices and serve it.***\n\n***209 If you want to cook with the same seven colours, cook them according to the time in the year***\n\n***You will always find more. You can make cooked dishes (gmues) and fritters of them. Make red out of the berries of the guelder rose (Viburnum opulus, galian per). When they are ripe, press them out like wine. Once they are pressed, boil them and add honey, that way you can keep them all year. You prepare sauces and cooked dishes (gmues) from those. You will always find green easily. You make it from parsley or other herbs. You make cooked dishes (gmues) and fried foods with that. You can also easily have brown. You make it from tart cherries. You make cooked dishes of that, however you wish. You can also easily have grey. Mix white and black together, that way it turns grey. You easily make black yourself. Cook it from honey and gingerbread (letzelten). Yellow is also good. You make it with saffron, but see you do not use too much or it will turn red etc.***\n\nThere are [many](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/26/a-wreath-of-many-colours/) [recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/25/a-jelly-in-four-colours/)for [coloured ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/06/colourful-roast-chickens/)[foods ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/17/fishy-rice-pudding-and-more-colouring-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)from medieval collections, but this is more detailed and systematic than [most](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/27/food-colour-recipes-from-the-innsbruck-ms/) [others](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/09/multicoloured-jelly-from-de-rontzier/). The planning and effort envisioned throughout the year to produce a ready supply suggests a large and wealthy household. The colours themselves are not terribly surprising. Cornflowers make blue, though I had not heard of preserving the colour in a mix of sloes and honey. Red from berries \u2013 the likeliest interpretation here is Viburnum opulus, but that is not certain \u2013 is treated similarly. Green is made with parsley, brown with cherries \u2013 most likely cooked down into a [cherry ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/27/a-cherry-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/)[sauce ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/22/cherry-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)\u2013 and yellow with saffron. Black is produced by burning gingerbread, though I wonder what the effect on the flavour would have been.\n\nThere is a recipe in the same source that uses all colours, and I hope to get around to it tomorrow. They are also useful individually, though. The idea of laying in a supply of all of them through the year reminds us how important it was to harvest ingredients in their season and preserve them generally. Medieval cooks depended much more on things they made themselves.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/21/making-food-colours/", "created_utc": 1745264080.0, "score": 41, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k4mf4d/making_medieval_food_colouring_15th_c/", "html_title": "Making Food Colours | culina vetus"}

{"title": "Taco Soup", "selftext": "I don't have images for you; this recipe lives in my 75-year-old mother's head. But I wanted to share it, as it's simple, cheap, and tasty. It's made using pantry ingredients and is extremely customizable. It was on constant rotation in our house when I grew up in the 80s.\n\nThe basic recipe goes like this:\n\nBrown some ground meat and chopped onion in a Dutch oven or large pot. Add a packet of taco seasoning.\n\nNext, turn it into a nice tomatoey soup using something from your pantry. You can add canned tomatoes with chiles, tomato sauce or soup, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, whole canned tomatoes, even tomato juice. Use whatever you've got on hand. \n\nIf you use whole canned tomatoes, you'll want to break them up a bit, but otherwise just stir everything together. Add water/broth if necessary to get a thick but slightly soupy consistency.\n\nNow add a bag of frozen corn and a can or 2 of beans.\n\nYou can also add other canned or frozen veggies like green beans or diced green chilies, as well as leftover fresh veggies you want to use up like jalapenos, bell peppers, or summer squash. Just chop up and add to the pot. \n\nLet everything simmer for 15-20 minutes. It should be a very thick soup with a medley of ingredients in every spoonful.\n\nWhile it's simmering, prepare your toppings: Stuff like hopped green onion, cilantro, sour cream, avocado, grated cheese, hot sauce, and tortilla or corn chips. Lay out on a plate or tray so people can top their bowls as they like.\n\nI always loved putting corn chips into my bowl, then ladling the soup over and adding toppings. Some people prefer to add tortillas chips on top.\n\n* This soup freezes well and makes a great, inexpensive meal prep.\n* Make it vegetarian by skipping the ground beef and adding more beans and veggies instead. My aunt did this for her kids for years as she raised them 7th-Day Adventist, and they didn't eat meat in their home. They remember it fondly.\n* It can be made in a slow cooker. Brown the meat and onion in a skillet, then add everything into the crock and simmer on low for 6 hours.\n* Can easily be made in a multicooker like an Instant Pot.\n\n  \nThis soup was a staple of my childhood and I still make it sometimes for nostalgia's sake.

{"title": "Colourful Fritters (15th c.)", "selftext": "I\u2019m back from my trip to the seaside, but quite exhausted and looking forward to another outing tomorrow. tonight, I will have to just drop you a random recipe for colourful fritters from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***211 A different fritter***\n\n***Take semeln (fine white) bread that is not newly baked. Slice it thin across the thin axis, not the broad. Take two kinds of filling: One is green, make the other black. Spread one filling on one side. If you cannot have green, make yellow and spread it on the slices. Then make a batter, it can be of eggs or of wine, and coat the slices in it. Lay two atop each other, fry them, and sprinkle sugar on them.***\n\nBasically, these are fried filled bread slices, a distant ancestor of grilled sandwiches, though here the point is the colour. Once put together, battered, and fried, the finished fritter would produce a striped effect if cut through: white-green-white-black-white. Green was typically derived from fresh herbs, black by browning gingerbread in honey or from mashed raisins. Yellow, of course, was made with saffron.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/14/colourful-fritters/", "created_utc": 1744658264.0, "score": 26, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jz7daw/colourful_fritters_15th_c/", "html_title": "Colourful Fritters | culina vetus"}

Bake the cookies for the suggested time and they should turn out just fine. Also, I used a 1 teaspoon scoop I bought from King Arthur Baking. \n\n**Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies**\n\n\n\n**Prep Time:**\u00a015 m\u00a0**Cook Time:**\u00a012 m\u00a0**Servings:**\u00a072 servings\u00a0**Source:**\u00a0[allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15004/award-winning-soft-chocolate-chip-cookies/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringContentType=Search)\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**4 1/2**\u00a0cups all-purpose flour\n\n**2**\u00a0teaspoons baking soda\n\n**2**\u00a0cups butter, softened\n\n**1 1/2**\u00a0cups packed brown sugar\n\n**1/2**\u00a0cup white sugar\n\n**2**\u00a0(3.4 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix\n\n**4**\u00a0eggs\n\n**2**\u00a0teaspoons vanilla extract\n\n**4**\u00a0cups semisweet chocolate chips\n\n**2**\u00a0cups chopped walnuts (optional)\n\n**DIRECTIONS**\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

{"title": "Birds in a Pie (15th c.)", "selftext": "Everyone knows the nursery rhyme and we all must have wondered if they really did that. It appears they did. This recipe from the Dorotheenkloster gives detailed instructions for making a pie that is both edible and will release live birds when cut.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/il5vssvynute1.jpg?width=1878&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aba03dfd08814b13d28a4f8d53cd2392e63ca9cc\n\n***212 A baked dish that belongs with entertainment***\n\n***Prepare a stiff dough with cold water or with quite hot water that can be shaped. Form (draw) it high, and make two crusts (choph) of it that are one inside the other. Make one one hand wider than the other. Slide them into an oven and let them bake. When they are ready and you are about to set them into each other (i.e. before baking), take two egg yolks or onions, that way they stick to each other before you put them into the oven. You can fill them this way: You must fill the inner crust. Take a roast partridge and small birds along with it. The birds should be fried in fat. Add a sweet sauce (sueppel) to it as you do with herons. Season it with sugar and spices. Cut apart the partridge like a capon, lay it in the inner crust, and add the small birds so it is full. Cover it with a broad sheet (of dough) that reaches across both crusts. Now take three yolks and brush them with it so they take on colour, and press down the dough sheet all around, that way it becomes one pie crust. Set it in the oven again. When it is dry, make a little gate in the side. (Take) Twenty live birds, and take a slice of bread that you make a door out of which you can open and close. And take 20 birds that are alive, and make the beak of one of them silver and the other gold, and before, also gild the front of their wings. Put them in (the outer crust) and cut a little window into it so they do not suffocate, or 2 or 3 (windows). Now close the little door, that way they stay inside. The 1 partridge and the (cooked) birds must be hot. Make a hole at the centre of the pie crust as big as it (the inner crust) is, and when you are about to serve, pour in the sauce so it does not harm the live birds. Take the cover you have cut out, put it back in place, and serve it.***\n\nThis recipe is quite fanciful \u2013 there are a few similarly elaborate ones in related manuscripts suggesting a lost common source \u2013 but it also looks practical and manageable; Two pie shells, the inner one large enough to accommodate a good portion of gamebirds, the outher holding live songbirds, equipped with air holes and a closeable door. This would not be easy by any description, but it could be done.\n\nOf course we would like to know more details. What kind of crust was used? The distinction between cold and hot water suggests this was more complex than plain water paste. but we don\u2019t know.

Spice it well and roll it out on a board so it looks like sausages.

[A very close one to this](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/31/bent-fritters-from-cgm-384-ii/) is found in the [Munich manuscript Cgm 384 II](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf). The sole significant difference is noticeable immediately:\n\n***63 Bent fritters (krapfen)***\n\n***For bent fritters like horseshoes, you shall grate good cheese and take half as much flour and break eggs into it so that it can be rolled out better. Season it enough and roll it on a board so that it becomes like sausages. Then shape bent fritters like horseshoes. Those will turn out very good and are quite healthy, and you shall fry them in fat.***\n\nThis is very similar, and it supports my idea that recipes were transmitted through dictation. It would explain how you go from *rosseysen* (horseshoes) to *rossorsn* (horses\u2019 arses) without it being noticed. At least I assume a transmission error is what happened here, though you masy want to try and twist some of the fritters aroubnd your finger like tight, puckered calamari in case it actually was intentional.

{"title": "Dealing with Greasy Aspic (15th c.)", "selftext": "Aspics were becoming very popular in the fifteenth century. Here is a way of dealing with one that turned out greasy:\n\n***197 A galantine (sulz) of chickens***\n\n***Take galantine of chickens. Take young chickens and boil them in vinegar. You remove their sweetness that way. Note that all chickens that you prepare for a galantine (zu galraid) must be boiled halfway in water and halfway in vinegar, both old and young ones, after they have been boiled in broth (? noch der wall der suppem). But if the galantine is too fat on top once it gels, take and pour boiling water on it, that way it becomes clear. Then tilt the bowl to one side so the water does not stay on it for long, otherwise it will melt.***\n\nThe basic recipe here is clear and unsurprising: Cooked chicken is set in a sour, gelatin-based aspic. It clearly is an aspic in this instance, though [both the words *sultz* and *galraid* can also be used to refer to thick sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/08/medieval-gelatin-powder-and-the-next-book-project/) well into the sixteenth century. There are no instructions on seasoning or serving, but we can draw on similar recipes for those. Basically, this is still how we make S\u00fclze in Germany today.\n\nThe interesting part is the instruction how to deal with an aspic that turns cloudy with excess fat. That is a common mistake to make, and not always easy to spot ahead of the gelling phase. It is not very significant if you serve your aspic sliced, as we usually do today, but if it goes to the table in a bowl, as was customary in the fifteenth century, transparency was important. Pouring hot water on the surface to melt the grease, then quickly pouring it off is a ready solution to this. It takes dexterity and good timing though.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Rather, it seems to be an example of robust creative culinary humour, an illustration of \u2018playing with food\u2019.\n\n[Woodcut by Albrecht D\u00fcrer: The Cook and His Wife, c. 1496\\/1497 courtesy of wikimedia commons. Lacing points are visible on the cook\u2019s jerkin.](https://preview.redd.it/r11y558s4ose1.jpg?width=2852&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dd5394725a1591f3243d97ee74a66fd1ad36ca5)\n\n***190 A galantine of deer(-skin) laces***\n\n***Take off the skin of a roe deer and scald it so that all the hair comes off. Then boil the skin well and let it shrink quite well (? scheph sy gar wol zu sammen). When it is boiled, cut off laces a span in length and two fingers wide, and make a galantine of it.***\n\nAgain, there is a parallel recipe in the Meister Hans collection, and in this case the dish is actually referred to as made of laces for hosen.\n\nLacing was a way of holding clothes together. Laces, often strings, but also made of leather, were passed through holes in the fabric and tied shut. Hosen, the precursors of modern trousers, were laced to the belt to hold them up, so hosen laces were familiar items to everyone. eating them, of course, would have been ridiculous.\n\nin culinary terms, the recipe is surprising, but not implausible. We know that [skin was cooked and eaten ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/)on occasion, if not often. The process described here, careful de-hairing and thorough boiling, is reasonably plausible and should turn a raw deerskin into something edible. Cut into pieces resembling lacing points, it was covered in aspic and served to the amusement of diners. Such a dish would testify to the skill and creativity of the cook and might even have been enjoyed for its flavour.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/03/lacing-points-in-aspic/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/03/lacing-points-in-aspic/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jqr679/lacing_points_in_aspic_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1743707243.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jqr679/lacing_points_in_aspic_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "ISO! Sheetcake & icing.", "selftext": "Okay. A few things. My paternal grandmother was a lunch lady for over 30 years. Pretty much any food I ever ate from her was a cafetria recipe. She worked between the 1960s & early 1990s. We're talking turkey tetrazini, rolls, iced brownies, peanut butter fudge, spaghetti, mashed potatoes w/ turkey (sometimes chicken) gravy. But HER CAKE. Look, I never exchanged one pleasant word with this woman - but her cake forgave all that. \n\nI am looking for a vanilla-vanilla cake & icing recipe. I have asked her kids - she never wrote down any of these recipes for them. \n\nIt's not the \"Texas\" sheet cake. It's not a coca-cola cake. It wasn't brown or chocolate.\n\nThe thing is, I bake a lot. I have tried every recipe I've come across (and I searched before posting and looked at every sheet cake and cafeteria cake recipe I could find) and I've either tried them or the finished product isn't the same.\n\nThe cake was yellow - I think any yellow cake could stand in here. This wasn't the best part. \n\nBut the ICING. The icing had that buttercream crunch, but not the sugary flavor of regular butter cream. Also, it was much softer than any butter cream I have ever made. I don't think it could be piped, for example. I've also tried cream cheese frostings - and it's not this wet. I have tried adding different flavorings to see if it was like almond or something else...and nothing seems to match. \n\nWhen she would make this, the icing wasn't thick. It was quite a thin layer. I don't know how else to describe it except that it was vanilla-buttercream-like, but had a distinctly different flavor depth than vanilla. I've often wondered if she did something to the butter. I also wonder, if the frosting is so thin...how did she spread it without getting crumbs in it? So I have wondered if it's poured over as it sets? But it isn't runny when you slice it or eat it (not running down the sides). You could pick it up like a brownie if you really wanted to. \n\nAnd always...I just wonder if it was simply due to manufacturing?

{"title": "An interesting fish recipe", "selftext": "To mark the occasion of today, I would like to take some time away from the Dorotheenkloster MS to present an addition to the Bologna MS of the *liber de ferculis malis*. I already referred to [the gloss in the Vatican copy](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/01/a-gloss-from-the-liber-de-ferculis-malis/), and this one, while not exactly corresponding, appears to parallel the second gloss found in this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7h8o6jyl8se1.jpg?width=467&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=330a2164e9728ff77abfa5368bac3126064f172b\n\n***Piscis Vasconum sive Aprilis***\n\n***Recipe piscem marinum magnum et durum.

In sartagine bene assati, infertur pisa viridia oryzacumve diebus ieiunibus. Et erit avium in oculo. \\[?\\]***\n\n***Gascon or April (?) fish***\n\n***Take a large and firm sea fish. It is cut skilfully into almost rectangular pieces no larger than a finger and is brushed with beaten egg and strewn with bread crumbs. See that no fish can be seen though the golden crust. It is well fried in a pan and served in fast days with green peas and rice. And it will be conspicuous to birds (lit: in the eyes of birds)***\n\nBoth copies of the liber de ferculis malis are incomplete, but both the scribal hand and the presence of this gloss suggest the Bologna MS is of more recent date. The association of the Vatican MS with Angus Og of Islay or his brother Alasdair Og Mac Donmaill, Lord of the Isles, gives us a reliable terminus post quem about 1200. The question remains open whether the glosses were already present when the first manuscript was brought from Scotland or are later additions by Italian scribes. The style in which it is written suggests the author was very enamoured of his own erudition, but far from proficient in classical Latin.\n\nThe recipe itself has some puzzling aspects. It is ascribed to Gascons/Basques (in the Vatican MS putatively to Frenchmen), though the association with Basque cusine seems far-fetched. Perhaps this is simply due to the reputation of the Gascon Atlantic seafarers as fearless whalers and fishermen. Neither can we make any sense of the final line. How is the dish \u2018conspicuous to birds\u2019, or literally \u2018in the birds\u2019 eye\u2019? We do not know. The alternative title of \u2018April fish\u2019 is equally confusing.\n\nA final note: When the Bologna MS was rebound in the 16th century, a scribe added the crude drawing of a bearded figure in long trousers and a doublet with the legend \u201cSchiffsherr vom Schneehause\u201d. It is uncertain whether any association with the text exists, but the connection with Atlantic fisheries suggest it may.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/01/an-interesting-seasonal-fish-recipe/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/01/an-interesting-seasonal-fish-recipe/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1joxl0z/an_interesting_fish_recipe/", "created_utc": 1743519282.0, "score": 12, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1joxl0z/an_interesting_fish_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Faux Headcheese for Lent", "selftext": "With regret, I will have to reduce the frequency of my postings here for the time being. Life, work, lectures and unfinished manuscripts are making demands on my time I cannot ignore. I will still try to be up here once or twice a week, though, and get back to more frequent posts as the situation allows. Today, I have a recipe for fake head cheese from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36rci7yz5hre1.jpg?width=569&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e3df47520eec17cf1a67f516a33dd9a1215960d\n\n***193 A pressed dish of fish***\n\n***Take pike and tench mixed, or whatever fish you want, but do not take barbels. Take the fish and boil them. When they are boiled, break them to pieces with the skin on and remove all bones. Then you must have one lot of isinglass and boil it for this (dish), but see there is not too much broth. Spice it nicely, pour the isinglass over the fish and stir it together. Lay it into a cloth folded double and weigh it down together. Lay it on a chest or a table and lay a board on top. Weigh it down with stones as heavy as two stone men (?) or heavier. Let it cool, and then take gingerbread, grind it small, add sugar, and boil it cleanly. Pour sweet wine into it and let it become (omission: thick?). Season it with good spices and saffron, and add a add half of a quarter pound of raisins and as much almonds. Put them into the sauce, let it cool, and serve it.***\n\nIn principle, this is quite similar to [a more cursory recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/30/fake-brawn-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) in the [K\u00f6nigsberg MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Konigsberg-Manuscript.pdf), but the technique is described more clearly here. The goal is to simulate Presskopf, head cheese, i.e. a dish in which pieces of cooked meat, traditionally from a pig\u2019s head, are held together by aspic. We have a surviving [recipe for the original meat dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/28/brawn-from-the-innsbruck-ms/), though it adds a layer of complexity that is not really necessary. Here, expensive fresh fish is used to simulate it. This is intended to amuse the wealthy on fast days.\n\nThe recipe begins with boiling fish whole, then breaking them in pieces and deboning them. This is actually easier using the fingers, which is also why fish was not cut with a knife at the table, and since the pieces are meant to be small, the process did not need to take account of damaging them. [Meat could be shredded very fine](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/22/meat-in-aspic-from-cgm-384-ii/) for some aspic dishes.\n\nUnlike with pig\u2019s feet or heads, the broth here needs added gelatin to make aspic and it is provided by isinglass. These dried swim bladders were the go-to source for medieval cooks and of course legal to eat on fast days. Once it is ready and seasoned, the broth and fish are wrapped tightly in several layers of cloth, laid under a board, and weighted down. I am not sure how to read the specification of weight. Technically it would mean \u2018two stone men\u2019, but there could well be a scribal error or some meaning that is unclear to us in it. Certainly it cannot mean the weight of two life-sized statues. In practice, unless you were making a very large amount, a few bricks should do nicely.\n\nOnce the gelatin has set, the fish can be unwrapped and sliced. At this point, you are also supposed to make a sweet sauce of gingerbread, sugar, wine, spices, raisins, and almonds to serve with it. It\u2019s not what modern eaters would expect, but a fashionable taste in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/28/fake-headcheese-for-lent/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/28/fake-headcheese-for-lent/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jm26f8/faux_headcheese_for_lent/", "created_utc": 1743187064.0, "score": 46, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jm26f8/faux_headcheese_for_lent/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Rufus Estes' Fried Chicken", "selftext": "Hey all, wanted to post this recipe and ask for some opinions. So in this old cookbook by Rufus Estes, \"Good Things to Eat\", he gives these instructions:\n\n\"\u201cFried Chicken\nCut up two chickens. Put a quarter of a pound of butter, mixed with a spoonful of flour, into a saucepan with pepper, salt, little vinegar, parsley, green onions, carrots and turnips, into a saucepan and heat. Steep the chicken in this marinade three hours, having dried the pieces and floured them. Fry a good brown. Garnish with fried parsley.\u201d\"\n\nTasting history with Max Miller did an episode on this recipe a couple of years ago, and the end result was not really flavorful, leading some commenters to suggest they had prepared the chicken incorrectly. Further suggestions were to mince the vegetables before putting them into the saucepan to make the marinade: \n\nHowever, another confusing part is where Estes says to \"steep\" the chicken in the marinade for three hours. Could he have meant to \"cook\" the chicken in this marinade at a low heat(doesn't seem like the marinade would produce enough to cook all of that chicken in for three hours)?

{"title": "Jessie's Key Lime Pie", "selftext": "Awhile back ( about 25 years ago )I was on a cooking board and someone posted a recipe from a Hospice Nurse. The note from her ........\nSeveral years ago I treated a young man from Key West, Florida who was dying of AIDS. A couple of weeks before he died, he gave me his 75 year old family recipe for Key Lime Pie. He explained that most Key Lime Pie recipes use condensed milk. Even restaurants in Key West serve Key Lime Pie made with condensed milk. Jessie was disdainful of this version. His family recipe, passed from generation to generation, does not used condensed milk. Jessie claimed it is the only authentic Key Lime Pie recipe. So in memory of Jessie, I offer it to you\n\n\n5 eggs, separated\n3/4 cup sugar\n1/3 cup Key lime juice\n1 tablespoon butter\n1/4 cup sugar (for meringue)\n1 (9-inch) baked pie shell ( you can use a graham crust if you prefer *)\n\nSeparate eggs into three bowls - 5 yolks in one bowl, 2 egg whites in another, and 3 egg whites in the third. This is the most important step in the whole operation!!!\nCream egg yolks, add 3/4 cup sugar and key lime juice and mix thoroughly. Cook over low heat until very, very thick, add butter and remove from heat. Let cool slightly.\nMeanwhile beat 2 egg whites until stiff, then fold into cooled lime mixture. Fill pie shell.\nBeat the other 3 whites until stiff. Beat in 1/4 cup sugar. Pile meringue on top of lime filling and bake at 325\u00b0F for 15 minutes.\n\nIf using graham cracker or cookie crust, brush crust with beaten egg white. Bake at 375F for 5 minutes.

{"title": "Figs in Jelly (15th c.)", "selftext": "The Dorotheenkloster MS contains this very attractive recipe:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brbebqgl13re1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d11af60fdf8ffe2bc5ead85fa4ba91bc35d7ebde\n\n***191 A galantine of figs***\n\n***Take a pound (talentum) of figs, wash them nicely, and let them boil up once. Leave on the stalks, and set them into a bowl so the stalks point upwards. When they are boiled, you must have one lot of isinglass and boil it in good wine, it should be Italian wine. Then take the broth that the figs were boiled in. Take as much of it as you need for the figs (i.e. to cover them). Season it with good spices and saffron, but not too much, just so the figs are covered with the broth. Serve it etc.***\n\nFigs, spices, wine, jelly \u2013 what is there not to like? [I already translated](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/04/figs-in-jelly/) and [cooked a very similar recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/24/figs-in-galantine/) found in the Meister Hans collection, so I refer anyone wanting to try it for themselves to thast blog post. It is indeed delicious.\n\nWhat interests me today is the close parallel between the two recipes. In Meister Hans, it reads:\n\n***Galantine of figs***\n\n***Item a galantine of figs, if you wish to make this, take a pound of figs. Wash them nicely and give them one boiling. Leave the stalks on, and set them in a bowl so that the stalks point upward. When they are boiled, you shall have isinglass and boil this in good wine and take the broth that the figs were boiled in (as well). And take of this as much as you need with the figs. Season it with good spices and saffron, and see that there is not too much of the broth, (just) so that the figs are covered.***\n\nThis really is the same recipe \u2013 indeed, much of the difference between the translations comes from me having refined my rendering of the same Middle German words over the past three years. This indicates first of all, as [I pointed out elsewhere](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/02/a-third-parallel-chicken-fritter/), that the Meister Hans text is not a solitary and does not originally date to the 1460s.\n\nInterestingly, the wording of the recipe is very similar overall. The small difference that the Dorotheenkloster MS seems to indicate a limited amount of saffron while Meister Hans more plausibly calls for a limited amount of liquid can be explained by a scribal oversight. Still, there are points where the texts diverge: The Dorotheenkloster MS specifically calls for Italian wine in an awkwardly appended half sentence that is lacking from Meister Hans. Meanwhile, Meister Hans introduces the recipe by naming it twice and adding a formulaic opening. I think this is best explained if we assume copying was done through dictation. A reader might well add a piece of information (Italian wine, mind!), a copyist include or leave out a formula that added no knowledge of value. That is how I think these texts were transmitted, and it may go some way towards explaining their occasional errors.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/26/figs-in-jelly-a-parallel/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/26/figs-in-jelly-a-parallel/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jkju9q/figs_in_jelly_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1743016079.0, "score": 79, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jkju9q/figs_in_jelly_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

Take their sheer (pretig) meat and chop it small. Season it with good spices and with parsley and grated bread and with chopped bacon and egg, and chop this all together. Take some of the chicken. Shape small balls in your hand and cover the bones with them so that it sticks out a little at the bottom. Lay them in boiling broth that is not excessively salted and let them boil until they are done. Chop bacon and parsley over it and serve it.***\n\n***185 A different dish of lamb***\n\n***Take half a lamb for one dish. Detach the ribs and all the bones and prepare the sheer meat (gepret) as described before. You must have Italian raisins. Prepare it the same way that you made it (in the previous recipe). Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThe idea of chopping or grinding up meat, making a seasoned paste, and putting it back on the bone to cook was a common one in medieval recipe collections. We meet it especially with chickens, with parallels in the [Inntalkochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Inntalkochbuch.pdf), the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf), and the [Kuchenmaistrey](https://ellipsisimprints.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach/). The resulting meatball-drumsticks can be boiled or fried. Here, interestingly, the same process is applied to lamb ribs.

{"title": "Raisin Jelly (15th c.)", "selftext": "The recipe for today is for a luxurious, showy dish:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67ngvk3pthqe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e310736111d149f2e0863f0f36f2599a46c2fad1\n\n***192 A galantine of raisins***\n\n***Take a pound (talentum) or raisins, wash them nicely, grind them small, and have ready isinglass that is boiled with wine. Take as much of that (the liquid) so it can be passed through (a sieve), add good spices and sugar, and put it in a serving bowl. Let it cool and cut it into pieces as you please. Now take nut milk, and you must have isinglass that is boiled in water. You need as much of this liquid as is needed for one dish and sweeten it with sugar. The milk must also be sweetened and it must gel. Do not make too much of that broth, and it should be white. Let it stand. Now take \u00bd (pound) of almonds and grind that, and again one lot of isinglass, pour it on the (almond) milk and sweeten it. Put that into a bowl and let it cool. Then take \u00bd (pound) of raisins, wash them, grind them small, and have \u00bd lot of isinglass and pass through the raisins (with that). The milk should be as thick as almond milk, and prepare it with good spicesand cloves. And when you put it into a bowl so it gels, cut it into four parts and take out two pieces that are not next to each other. Put in the black (jelly) of the raisins in their place. That way the serving bowl is whole again. Let it cool and serve it etc.***\n\nThis looks like it is more or less the same recipe twice, but the principle is clear. Raisins are ground into a paste and cooked with wine and gelatin \u2013 in this case isinglass, the swim bladder of sturgeon \u2013 into a spiced jelly. This is poured into a serving bowl and left to solidify. Then, a second jelly is made with sweetened nut milk and isinglass. The raisin jelly is then cut in four quarters and two are removed and replaced with the white jelly. Presumably, the two missing pieces can be put in another dish to produce a second such platter. The result, a black and white quartered serving bowl filled with the most expensive ingredients in combination, would have graced a wealthy table. The phrase \u201ccut it into pieces as you please\u201d suggests that more complex designs were at least envisioned.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/23/raisin-galantine/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/23/raisin-galantine/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ji7w1m/raisin_jelly_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1742759167.0, "score": 54, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ji7w1m/raisin_jelly_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

More pictures in the blog.](https://preview.redd.it/2z6ywsocj3qe1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acea33b2fd3530a003bca8f8b60830aa86ef7b46)\n\n***95 Item if you would make pears, take them and cut the pears off above (cut off the tops). Cut out the core and throw it away. And pound the other with fat meat. And take (add) egg yolk and spices and salt. Fill that back into the pears. And set them in the embers and let them roast.***\n\nThis is an interesting idea and, like many historic recipes involving pears, probably calls for [hard and tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/02/dried-pear-recipes-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) [cooking pears](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/22/a-black-tart/) rather than the soft, juicy dessert pears that dominate our supermarkets today. These are available ast markets here, but with shopping opportunities limited, I was reduced to picking the most unripe import I could find. They did not do badly.\n\nThey hollowed out nicely with a metal spoon and a fruit knife, and the fruit pulp that I could detach from the core went into the blender with beef and egg yolk. Filling them was easy enough, and after I had secured the tops with metal skewers, they went into a hot oven.\n\nCooking them in actual embers as was done with fruit (and eggs) historically may have made them softer and cooked them faster, but in the end I was content with the result. Pear and meat combine well. Of course coming from Northern Germany, I already knew this, but it was good to have confirmation for this particular approach.\n\nThe Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch (Middle Low German Cookbook) aka Wiswe MS or  \nWolfenb\u00fcttel MS is the earliest of the very few Low German recipe sources we have. The collection of 103 recipes was written in the late 15th or very early 16th century and edited by Hans Wiswe, a German scholar, in 1956. Very little is known about its context, but it shares some recipes in parallel with the Harpestreng tradition. The original text as edited by Wiswe is found online at https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb05/germanistik/absprache/sprachverwendung/gloning/tx/mndk.htm.

Mix (temperir) it together and shape small balls with it. Dredge them through an egg batter and fry them in hot fat. You can serve these little balls with all kinds of roast dishes.***\n\nAs a recipe, this is a very straightforward way of using up leftovers. Cooked meat is chopped or mortared, mixed with eggs and flour, and turned into dumplings. The recipe\u2019s sentence structure and punctuation (*\u2026, hachk ayr,\u2026*) suggests that it is the eggs which are chopped, which would suggest hard-boiled ones, but a small change would change the meaning to chopping the meat which looks more plausible. The resulting mass, bound with flour, is seasoned with herbs, coated in an egg batter, and fried. It really sounds very twentieth-century.\n\nInterestingly, they are not supposed to be a dish in their own right, but served with all roast dishes (*aller hand praten*). We need not understand this strictly as only roasted foods. Rather, it means dishes fit to serve as the centerpiece of a meal or course, broadly what we think of as \u2018main\u2019 dishes today. Here is a way of using the remnants of yesterday\u2019s roast to eke out today\u2019s perhaps not quite adequately sized piece. I can envision a circle of little golden-brown fried meatballs arranged around the platter as it comes to the table, though of course that is very much a modern style.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/20/medieval-meat-mcnuggets/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/20/medieval-meat-mcnuggets/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfzn62/medieval_meat_mcnuggets_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1742504737.0, "score": 40, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfzn62/medieval_meat_mcnuggets_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to Perfect Grandma's Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge?", "selftext": "My grandma, who recently died, had the most complex and finicky- but delicious- fudge recipe I've ever encountered. It was very acclaimed in her town, and I was the only person she ever taught it to. But while I can get the taste right, I cannot usually get the right consistency. I'm hoping people here might be able to help. Four out of six times I made it, it came out crumbly. The other two times were perfect, so I feel like I'm close but must be missing some slight variation to my technique. \n\nI've been looking into the science of fudge, and it sounds like I need to avoid sugar crystallization. Fudge experts talking about more normal recipes emphasize letting the fudge cool after reaching the soft ball stage (234 Fahrenheit) and before stirring. But that is completely incompatible with grandma's recipe below,  which is emphatic that I **must immediately** mix in the peanut butter after reaching soft ball stage and then **immediately** pour it into the final pan or I will end up with nothing but a heap of crumbs. What do people who know more about fudge than I do think?\n\n  \n**Ingredients:**\n\n2 Cups Granulated Sugar\n\n1 Tablespoon Light Corn Syrup\n\n4 Tablespoon Cocoa Powder\n\n1 Cup Half & Half\n\n1 teaspoon Flour\n\n1 Cup Creamy Peanut Butter\n\n1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract\n\n1 Tablespoon Unsalted Butter\n\n\n\n**Grandma's Instructions:**\n\n1) Butter an 8 inch square cake pan.\n\n2) In a deep cooking pan, mix together the 2 cups of sugar, tablespoon of light corn syrup, 4 tablespoons of cocoa powder, 1 cup of half and half, and teaspoon of flour. Do not heat yet!\n\n3) Put a candy thermometer in now and fasten it to the side of the pan. **Never** put a room temperature candy thermometer into an already heated mixture or you can cause crystallization and ruin everything.\n\n4) Stir until sugar is dissolved.\n\n5) Only then put the stove at medium heat\n\n6) Stir just enough to dissolve the cocoa once it gets a bit hotter\n\n7) **Never** allow any sugary residue to remain on the sides. This will cause crystallization and ruin everything later.\n\n8) Now allow it to slowly boil on medium heat. **Never** stir during this stage. Only swirl it gently and occasionally, and make sure to scrape down any residue that tries to stick to the sides.\n\n9) During this time, in a mixing bowl, mix together the 1 cup of peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of butter. Keep those in that separate mixing bowl, ready to later mix in the main ingredients\n\n10) Wait a very long time (often 40 minutes or more in my experience), watching carefully for it to get past the boiling plateau and then reach 234 Fahrenheit (the soft ball stage)\n\n11) **Immediately** scrape the contents of that pot into the mixing bowl\n\n12) **Immediately** mix it all together\n\n13) **Immediately** pour that into the cake pan the instant it seems to be mixed together\n\n14) Let it cool to room temperature on the counter\n\n15) Only then cut it.\n\n  \nI follow all these steps but, as I said, it's only come out perfect 2 times out of 6. Otherwise, it ends up crumbly (which as I understand it means sugar crystallized) despite all my precautions. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts about that?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfh0q6/how_to_perfect_grandmas_chocolate_peanut_butter/", "created_utc": 1742445361.0, "score": 43, "author": "Rtyeta", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfh0q6/how_to_perfect_grandmas_chocolate_peanut_butter/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Another Fish Roe Dough Experiment (15th  c.)", "selftext": "Life is still keeping me on my toes, so here is another old experiment of mine. Back in lockdown, when I was able to get fresh herring roe, I tried out both[ the fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/16/fish-roe-fritters-an-old-experiment/) and a pastry dough based on arecipe in the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrdi5qvp7ipe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fab811280ac211e2215afdc6ded756fb3362f012\n\n***43 Item if you would make many things during the fast that shall then be in the form (role) of eggs, you must have as much pike roe as you need. You shall pound that in a mortar. Then grind it small on a mustard mill. That way you may bake infidel cakes (heydenische koken \u2013 a fritter), struven (another kind of fritter), gesken (?), rorkoken (tubular fritters), morkeln (mushroom-shaped fritters), rosinspeckenne (raisin and bacon fritters?) and sage leaves. You may (also) make pastry coffins from the strong dough and you must let them harden in a small cooking vessel (deghel) that is hot. Then fill into it what you have of good fish, of green eels, of lampreys, raisins and pears, saffron and pepper and cloves. And pour on it a good wine in its measure. And that the filling be cooked beforehand, let it cook strongly (thohopeseden) and bake strongly (thohopebacken). Give them fire below and above in its measure. And serve them.***\n\nMuch as I did with the roe for the fritters, I mashed up this batch thoroughly and worked it into a dough with a dark Typ 1050 wheat flour. It took a lot more flour than I thought, but in the end I arrived at a stiff paste that could be rolled out. It was far from a pleasure to work with, but it could be managed reasonably well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lxecg8wr7ipe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a57fd00e42a28843bb71ceb1363ce7fb8e5507b\n\nI worked it into a small pastry case for an open-face tart and blind-baked it. The consistency was not pleasant \u2013 chewy and heavy. I think the dough may be better suited for frying than baking, and indeed some tart and [pastry recipes of the time recommend adding large amounts of hot fat during the cooking process](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/19/baking-pastries-the-italian-way/). There was no discernible fish flavour in the crust, so that concern was allayed.\n\nI also used some of the dough to make closed pastries, baked with a modern filling of ajvar and kashkaval cheese. These turned out significantly more pleasant than the tart, but there still was no real \u2018crunch\u2019 to them. I think it may be a matter of rolling out the dough still thinner than I dared, and again, frying rather than baking may be the thing to do. But as a basic Lenten conceit, fish roe can work like eggs in baked goods.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/18/another-fish-roe-dough-experiment/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/18/another-fish-roe-dough-experiment/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jeeboa/another_fish_roe_dough_experiment_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1742328040.0, "score": 14, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jeeboa/another_fish_roe_dough_experiment_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Fish Roe Fritters for Lent (15th c.)", "selftext": "Life is limiting my ability to produce new translations, so I\u2019ll fall back on sharing some old experiments I made during pandemic lockdown for now. This is an interesting[ recipe using fish roe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/12/fish-roe-pancakes-in-roux-sauce/) from the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6v2og13q3pe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b41f08545baccd7874f15d8bd2f1e0706b235812\n\n# Item if you would make a fried cake (spisekoken) of pike roe, take roe that is finely ground in a mill. Add to it parsley, figs, raisins, what (whichever?) you have, and white bread. Stir it strongly with sweet oil and put it into another mortar or thick-walled vessel that is in proper measure (large enough). Let it fry strongly (or: long? tohope) in hot oil with a gentle fire. When it is done, cut it into pieces as thick as you think you can manage. Take pepper and saffron. Take vinegar and honey. Make a sauce of that. Serve the cake with this.\n\nI started out with the only fish roe I could get \u2013 herring. The fishmonger actually gutted the fish to get it for me. I am not sure how the qualities of herring and pike roe differ, and if I ever get my hands on pike roe I will try it. So far, though, that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nThe roe made a smooth puree very quickly. I ran the processor a second time to break open the individual eggs because I assume that would happen in a handmill. At this stage, the roe was pronouncedly smelly, but that changed completely on cooking.\n\nI made the dough with only breadcrumbs and raisins, not figs for the first batch because I was making so little. It became solid much faster than I expected, so I had to shape patties. I am not sure whether that is how it was supposed to go, though some recipes for the non-Lenten version envision it.\n\nFried in oil, the finished *spisekoken* were quite good, even better than the standard grated bread pancakes so common in the medieval German tradition. I only added a bit of pepper to see how they carried spice. The answer was: well. They were clearly fish, but not very fishy, and will very likely work well with any kind of sauce.\n\nMore pictures at: [https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/16/fish-roe-fritters-an-old-experiment](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/16/fish-roe-fritters-an-old-experiment)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jct8xe/fish_roe_fritters_for_lent_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1742152624.0, "score": 17, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jct8xe/fish_roe_fritters_for_lent_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Garlic Sauce for Chicken (15th  c.)", "selftext": "This sauce from the Dorotheenkloster MS looks very good indeed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ubdnys5hioe1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d49b5b1847f018a2f70807c47943038b21c566ae\n\n***183 A sauce (condiment) with roast chickens***\n\n***Grind garlic with salt, and peel the heads well. Mix 6 eggs into it without their whites, and add vinegar and a little water, not too sour. Let it boil up so it stays thick. You can make (serve) roast chickens with this or whatever you wish. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nMedieval upper-class cuisine had a complicated relationship with garlic. On the one hand, it stood for everything antithetical to gentility: growing in the earth, cheap, plentiful, and pungent. It made you smell like a peasant. On the other hand, they were not going to forgo something that just tasted this good. This sauce is one example of this.\n\nGarlic, salt, egg yolks, and vinegar would make for a rich, creamy, and uncluttered flavour that should appeal to modern tastes as much as to medieval. Absent oil or fat, this is not aioli but a sauce that surely required very careful heating to produce the egg liaison that held it together without curdling the egg yolks. This also illustrates nicely the complexity behind the verb sieden. I usually render it as \u2018boil\u2019, but it really covers all forms of heating food in liquid, from a rolling boil to a gentle simmer. Here, we are probably talking of slow, gentle heat to induce the sauce to thicken before it is served, stopping just as the surface begins to stir.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/13/garlic-sauce-for-chicken/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/13/garlic-sauce-for-chicken/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jakykv/garlic_sauce_for_chicken_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741895427.0, "score": 54, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jakykv/garlic_sauce_for_chicken_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "School cafeteria cheese buns from the 70s?", "selftext": "My parents were both public school teachers (now retired). They worked at different schools from one another, and both taught in a different district from the one in which we lived (and I attended).\n\n\n\nAt the school in which my mom taught, for a few years the cafeteria made things from scratch (maybe this was the norm? I don't know, I have never eaten school cafeteria food myself or even been inside of it, actually, oddly enough), and sometimes they made these cheese buns that were just about my favorite thing ever. I've been trying to recreate them since, and I have the bread recipe close enough to hit the right notes, but I haven't been able to figure out the execution.\n\n\n\nThese were fluffy, soft, white flour, yeasted rolls that were just slightly sweet. Inside, there was a pocket of oozy, melty cheese. The cheese did solidify at room temperature or, obviously, colder, but it stayed a pocket of cheese and could be reheated fine.\n\n\n\nEvery time I have tried this, I don't end up with an oozing pocket of cheese so much as an empty pocket of air, lined with cheese that is sort of fused to the edges of the air pocket. Very tasty, but not what I'm trying to do.\n\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n\n\nIt just occurred to me that I have only tried this with natural cheeses, such as cheddar and the like.

{"title": "Cooking Calfskin (15th c.)", "selftext": "Just a short entry for today. This is from the Dorotheenkloster MS again:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsg65y3ndqne1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d481a368dfa2eaf66d817ab7969ee912a3515a3f\n\n***161 A good dish of calf skin***\n\n***Take the skin of a calf, wash it well and prepare it cleanly. Cut it into small pieces. Season it with saffron and good spices and with parsley.***\n\nThis is really barely a recipe, just a few notes, and it leaves out the most important step, but it is also very interesting and opens up avenues of speculation. Skin is not commonly eaten in Europe today, so it is tempting to dismiss this as a sort of makeshift, a famine food, but it is pretty clearly not that. Anyone who could afford saffron and spices could also pay for proper meat and wanted to eat the skin in this instance.\n\nYou can eat cooked animal skin. Cowskin is even considered a [delicacy in parts of West Africa](https://www.chefadora.com/omalicha/peppered-kpomo-cowskin-xs4jmwtkhs). The reason why Europeans did not usually eat the skin of the cattle they consumed was not that they tasted bad, but that they were needed more urgently to make parchment, rawhide, and leather. Keeping the people of the continent in shoes alone required vast quantities.\n\nHere, someone is making the conscious choice to keep and cook a calfskin rather than pass it on to a tanner or parchment maker. It may be a way of displaying status \u2013 this household has no need to monetise the (already expensive) calf efficiently \u2013 or a local tradition preserved in writing. It is certainly interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, the recipe doesn\u2019t record what is actually done with the skin. Cleaning is specifically mentioned, and that is [an important step with all skins](https://kitchenbun.com/how-to-prepare-cow-skin-cooking-cleaning-tips/). Laborious defleshing, removing the hair, and cleaning precede any cooking. What happens next is a mystery, though. I would speculate that the skin pieces are simmered for a long time to soften them before they are further processed.\n\nOnce softened, the skin pieces might have been fried, producing crispy, spicy bites with a chewy centre. We can easily imagine a dish full of them speckled with green flecks of parsley. Serving them in a thickened sauce, a spicy cooking liquid, or an aspic is really equally probable, though. We simply do not know.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j7hzdw/cooking_calfskin_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741555169.0, "score": 23, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j7hzdw/cooking_calfskin_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Apparently, porpoises were cooked as meat despite the fact they were canonically classed as fish. Their name, *merswein*, literally sea pig, suggests as much, and here it is explicitly said they are treated like any other pig. Today, of course, the word *Meerschwein* refers to [a guinea pig](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/06/guinea-pig-recipes-from-marx-rumpolt/), but they are still called *Schweinswal* in modern German.\n\nIt is possible that salted or otherwise preserved porpoise meat was actually brought to the Alps. If it was, though, it was not likely a major trade item and certainly not usable for many of the dishes described here. Rather, these may have bewen familiar to people from their travels to coastal regions of Italy or Western Europe. The upper classes of fifteenth-century Europe often travelled widely, after all.\n\n(next day:)\n\nA propos of [yesterday\u2019s post of how to cook porpoises](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/07/cooking-porpoise/), these are more practical instructions from [Maino de Maineri\u2019s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maino_De_Maineri) [*opusculum de saporibus*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-opusculum-de-saporibus.pdf):\n\n\\*\u2026\\****About fish one must know that the grosser of flesh, the harder to digest and of greater superfluity and humoral nature (i.e. the more out of balance) they are, the more they need hotter and sharper condiments. And this is true not only for fish, but also for meat. From this follows that \u2018bestial\u2019 (animal-like) fish and especially the porpoise (lit. sea pig, porcus marinus), whether roasted or boiled, need hotter and sharper sauces. And this is similarly understood for other fish according to how much or little they resemble the porpoise.***\n\n***The condiment that is appropriate for the porpoise is strong boiled black pepper sauce whose composition is to be of of black pepper and cloves and toasted bread soaked in vinegar, and mixed with broth of fish.***\n\n***And if one should wish to preserve them for several days, a galantine is made whose composition is: Take cinnamon, galingale, and cloves and mix each two m. (unit of weight), (and) toasted bread, half a loaf worth two imperials (unit of currency). The bread has boiled wine vinegar poured over it. Thus galantine is made with the cooking liquid of water and wine used for the fish. And the fish are cooked in water and wine, and the galantine is to be sufficient for ten people.***\n\nWhile the anonymous author(s) of the Dorotheenkloster MS most likely described their porpoise dishes based on hearsay, it is likely that Maino de Maineri, a highly reputed Italian physician who wrote in the mid-14th century, had personal experience to go on. Porpoises were eaten in the Mediterranean, along with a wide variety of other sea fish. His medical advice concerns the condiments to serve them with.\n\nThe author clearly recognises the mammalian (\u201cbestial\u201d) nature of the porpoise, though this does not lead him to place it outside the class of fish. Rather, it represents one end of the spectrum within that class and, being so much like meat, requires spicy sauces. The one he recommends is actually a familiar one to German recipe readers \u2013 *pfeffer*, a highly seasoned sauce made with the cooking liquid and thickened with toasted bread. The powerful taste of black pepper and cloves heightened by vinegar was thought to counteract the cold and moist qualities of the porpoise.\n\nThe second recipe is harder to parse, but it seems to describe a galantine of the bread-thickened type. Here, a thick sauce is poured over cooked meat or fish to exclude the air as it congeals, preserving it for a short time. Seasoned with cinnamon, galanga, and cloves, it would impart a characteristic flavour to the meat.\n\nThis is clearly not the only way porpoises could be prepared. Maino de Maineri\u2019s work is focused on sauces which were considered medically indicated with many foods, not the culinary possibilities of an ingredient. But here, we at least have an idea of what was done with those porpoises.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j6n3x8/cooking_porpoises_14th15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741457528.0, "score": 14, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j6n3x8/cooking_porpoises_14th15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

They are, however, clearly different and complement rather than repeat the first. This is not always the case in medieval recipe collections where dishes and instructions are often duplicated.\n\nThe preparations themselves are not complicated. In recipe #168, the birds are boiled and served in a honey-mustard sauce. This is also how small songbirds were sometimes cooked. Recipe #169 has them boiled with bacon and served in their broth, much like boiled chickens were, while #170 is for a galantine (*galreid*). That termn can refer to either a thickened sauce or an aspic, but in this case it clearly means the latter.

It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus.

Slice them thin and fry them in fat. Add eggs, pepper, caraway (or cumin, chummel) and salt. Stir it together as soft as poached (gestuffelt) eggs. Pass (streich) them into boiling fat in a pan. When it is fully cooked, serve it.***\n\nAgain, the naming problem rears its head. The same dish is known as *larus* in the Mondseer Kochbuch and *lanncz* in Meister Hans. Here, it is given a bland, descriptive name. Another way the three differ is in describing the consistency aimed for. Here, it is *gestuffelt* which means poached eggs. The Mondseer Kochbuch had *get\u00fcfftelnt* which makles little sense but I thought might be a badly corrupted version of the phrase for scrambled eggs. In truth, the scribe might not have understood. Meister Hans simply has foilled eggs, a different class of recipes entirely and a likely response to the writer not understanding an original they were working from.\n\nNote I am not saying the Dorotheenkloster MS recipe was the basis for the Mondseer one which was copied into Meister Hans. Surely, the number of surviving recipe books is small compared to those lost, and such direct connections are very improbable. It is clear they belong to a continuum though.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

{"title": "More on Blanc Manger (15th  c.)", "selftext": "If there is one dish no medieval recipe collection can be without, it seems to be blanc manger, chicken breast cooked with almond milk and rice. The Dorotheenkloster MS has three such recipes:\n\n***126 A courtly gm\u00fcs of old chickens that is called plamencher***\n\n***Take \u00bd pound (talentum) of almonds. Let the chickens boil until they are tender, blanch the almonds and pass them through with clean water. Take a quarter pound (virdung) of rice and pick it clean, pound it, and pass it through a cloth or sieve. Take the meat of the hens and chop it small. Boil the almond (milk), put in the meat of the hens and mix it together. Let the almond milk boil until it it is done (zeitig) and add a pound (phunt) of pig fat (sweinens smaltz). When it begins to thicken, pour in the pig fat and stir it vigorously. As soon as it begins to boil, add a quarter pound (virdung) of sugar. When it is boiled halfway, add the sugar and let it boil well, and keep doing that until it gives back (separates out) the fat. Thus the dish is prepared. Serve it with a good, solid spoon that is deep (nust) enough, and spread it out with the spoon so it becomes smooth. That gemuez is called plamanscher.***\n\n***138 A blanc manger (plamenschir)***\n\n***Take thick almond milk and chicken breasts that were picked apart (gezaist). Add them to the milk and stir it with rice flour. Add enough fat and enough sugar, and serve it.***\n\n***139 Again a blanc manger (plamenschir)***\n\n***Take picked apart and (probably an unnecessary conjunction rather than a lacuna) chicken breasts and good almond milk. (Put) the stirred chicken into the milk with rice flour and colour it well with colourful flowers. Add enough fat and boil it very well. Add enough sugar, that is called a plamanschir.***\n\nI talked about the issue of names before, and it is evident again here: This dish has many. Whether it is described innocuously [as a zuckermus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/11/blancmanger-by-yet-another-name/), called by the Latinate fantasy name [Pulverisei](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/21/blancmanger-by-any-other-name/), or by any number of derivations [from its French or Italian designation](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/30/another-blanc-manger/), it is all over the place, and that seems deliberate. Here, we find a names that derive from the French blanc manger. The recipes seem most closely related to those in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) and the [Buoch von guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise), but theyare not exact parallels. Indeed, the third one specifically mentions colouring the resulting dish with flowers which runs counter to the original intent of a white dish, though it would surely make a great canvas for that.\n\nAside from the relative reluctance to adopt foreign names in many instances, what I find interesting is the variety among the terms that make it into the manuscript tradition. Here alone, we find *plamencher*, *plamanscher*, *plamenschir* and *plamanschir*. These are close to the *plamensir* of the Buoch von guoter Spise, and quite a distance from the *plamauschy, bla manschy* or (Italian-influenced) *manschy plamby* of Philippine Welser, let alone the Italianate *manscho blancko* of Marx Rumpolt. Most of these terms are derived from the French, and clearly they are spelled phonetically. This is a salutary reminder that while we study mainly manuscripts, a large part \u2013 quite likely most \u2013 elite culinary culture was oral. Nobody reading a copy of the Viandier would come up with *pla mauschy*, but someone speaking French, even quite well, could easily get there. This, too, changes in the transition to Early Modern print culture, where the joke is on the ignorant person insisting on pronouncing a word as it is spelled (usually possible in German, challenging in French, impossible in English).\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/01/more-blanc-manger/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/01/more-blanc-manger/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j1af0p/more_on_blanc_manger_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1740864919.0, "score": 28, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j1af0p/more_on_blanc_manger_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Shrimp Puffs with Homemade Dough", "selftext": "My mother made a recipe that included shrimp, parmesan, and green onions as a type of pastry i think?

Add the soft butter and mix into a paste. Add the egg whites, then the whole egg, beating after each addition to begin building the structure of the cake. Scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl periodically.\nIn a small bowl, mix the yogurt (or milk) with the vanilla and almond extracts.

Put entire cloves into the filling. If you want to have enough for one mess, add two eggs. When the filling is properly prepared and also not too thin, make little dumplings out of it. Put the filling into the claws. Take meat broth and get it boil well in a pan. Then put the claws into it, and when you have put them in, take a cauldron fill it with clear broth, place the (meat-)balls into the claws and place them in the hot broth. That way they become crooked so they stay in place. Let them boil until they are done. Prepare a congealed (? geliberte) broth with it and do not let it boil away. Serve it.***\n\nChicken feet are edible and used to be [eaten everywhere chickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_feet) were, though today most Western culinary traditions frown on them and we export them to China. This recipe is interesting because of the care it takes and because its decorative inventiveness. The process is not entirely clear \u2013 the boiling process looks to be repeated unnecessarily, or perhaps a parboiling stage is meant by the first \u2013 but the intent looks clear enough. In the end, we have an aspic or thick broth with chicken feet, each one grasping a veal meatball.

The one for millet [only shows up in Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/03/a-lenten-feast-in-2021/), where it is a little less clear than here. They are interesting to try, with a good deal of potential for error, and for what they do.\n\nCereal porridges and legumes were the plainest, least excitinbg dishes in the medieval kitchen and especially beans and peas carried associations of humility. That explains why [so much effort](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/29/all-about-peas-part-one/) [went into making them](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/30/all-about-peas-part-two/) [appealing to wealthy patrons.](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/25/how-to-serve-peas/) Here, we can see the playbook very clearly: Process the food, add animal protein (eggs), and produce Maillard flavours. The peas are actually fried, presumably cooked to solidifying in a greased pot or pan, before they are roasted. These were the desirable flavours of the time and made even such lowly dishes acceptable without causing diners to lose status.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

{"title": "Piped Fish Fritters (15th c.)", "selftext": "This is an interesting and slightly disturbing recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS. [Piped fritters, rather like churros](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/20/piped-fritters-2/), are not uncommon, but making them of fish is:\n\n***146 Again a gm\u00fcs of pike***\n\n***Scale a pike, remove the bones, chop it, and pound it in a mortar. Add flour and yeast, pepper and salt. Knead it all together into a dumpling (close). Lay it into a pot that has a hole in the bottom the size of a finger and force the dumpling through it into a pan that has boiling oil or fat in it. Fry it well in that and serve it.***\n\nOnce again, we find a parallel in Meister Hans:\n\n***#151 Again to prepare fish in the shape of eels***\n\n***Item take and scale a pike and chop it to pieces, and remove its bones, or the fine flesh (praten) first, and pound it in a mortar. Add to it flour, honey and salt. Mix this and place it in a pot that has a hole as big as a finger. Force the fish through this into a vessel with boiling oil. Give it the shape of an eel, and fry it well. Serve it forth.***\n\nThis is clearly originally the same recipe, though it changed in transmission. The different name highlights the tendency of the Dorotheenkloster MS to name just about any dish a *gm\u00fcs*. In Middle High German, the word does get used in the sense of \u2018cooked dish\u2019 occasionally, and that may go some way towards explaining the widespread misconception that all medieval food was cooked to a mush. Certainly this is no *Mus* nor *Gem\u00fcse* in the modern sense.\n\nThe second salient difference between the two is in the ingredients. Meister Hans prescribes honey and salt while the Dorotheenkloster MS adds salt, pepper, and yeast (*hefen*). This may well be a transcription error, but it is hard to see what word could be mistaken for it. If it really is yeast, it suggests that flour made up a significant part of the dough. Otherwise, there would be no leavening effect.\n\nThe proportion of ingredients is, again, the stumbling block in reconstructing this dish. Is it a fish paste held together with a little flour, or a flour dough using fish to flavour and moisten it? As long as we don\u2019t know what we are supposed to aim for, we can only try out variations. I tried to produce the version in Meister Hans, made with honey and salt and consisting mainly of ground raw fish. The experience taught me that while this is feasible and holds together well, it needs to be cooked gently at a low temperature or the honey will burn and the result look like \u2013 not an eel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwfb59mo3rke1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c657cf08dce8cdea51daf5848ffc0b8f9bb00b7a\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Soften them in water for one night, wash them, and cook them until they are almost done. Cool it and take off the scales with a knife. Cut them (the fish) into thin slices. Serve a good pheffer sauce with it, or if you want to have them cold, a sweet mustard. Prepare it with spices, pour it over the fish and serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis recipe explains how sturgeon come to be mentioned in recipe collections far inland \u2013 in this case in Vienna, very far from where they are usually fished. The instruction to water the fish for a night makes it clear that it is either dried or salted. This makes sense \u2013 a high-status food would have been profitable to trade over long distances.\n\nThe preparation is not very inspiring. The sturgeon (or salmon) is treated [much like stockfish is in the same source ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/08/stockfish-recipes/)(recipe #129). It is rehydrated, boiled, sliced, and served with a sauce.

Both sauces are recorded in our sources frequently, as it were the default options of the late medieval cook. Still, this may be a simple dish, but it required some skill and a fair amount of wealth.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/21/cooking-preserved-sturgeon/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/21/cooking-preserved-sturgeon/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iv1i9q/cooking_dried_sturgeon_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1740171485.0, "score": 10, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iv1i9q/cooking_dried_sturgeon_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Chitterlings in Vinegar Herb Sauce (15th c.)", "selftext": "Not all recipes in the medieval tradition are appealing to modern tastes at first glance, but this one may not be at all bad:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20rn62m2g5ke1.jpg?width=696&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1012b800e504b773456236147a2ca429a681b756\n\n***133 A gmues of chitterlings (kaldaunen)***\n\n***Take the stomach and gut of a pig and cut it into squares (w\u00fcrfellat). Then take parsley, sage, mint, pennyroyal, eggs, bread, caraway (or cumin? chummel) in greater quantity than pepper. Grind this with vinegar and good broth. Pour that on the chitterlings (kaldaum) and add fat. Let it boil up so it becomes thick. If you do not have fresh herbs (gr\u00fcn ding), take other seasonings. This way you can cook with chitterlings (kaldaun).***\n\nThis recipe reminds us that when we talk of meat consumption in medieval Germany, we mean all parts of the animal. There is a clear hierarchy to them, and while we have many instructions for the prized pieces \u2013 roasting-grade muscle meat, brains, and liver \u2013 there are fewer for the less desirable bits. This is a valuable survival. The stomachs and guts of slaughtered animals \u2013 were a saleable commodity, and here we can get an idea what was done with them. The recipe is also notable for not ennobling its subject matter with high-value additions. This is not poverty cuisine, but it could easily be envisioned on the table of an artisan or substantial farmer.\n\nInterpreting the dish depends on how we read the proportion of ingredients, and whether the eggs added to it are raw or cooked. We have sauces that specify boiled eggs, so this is not as odd as it sounds. I read it as mainly a bread-thickened, vinegary sauce of fresh herbs which could be quite attractive. All herbs are ground to a paste with eggs and grated bread, then added to a quantity of broth and vinegar and boiled until it thickens into a homogenous liquid. Pepper and caraway (or cumin \u2013 the word is still ambiguous at this point) give it a spicy bite at an affordable rate. In urban environments, this would be available regularly as butchers working year-round sold the innards by weight. In rural areas and larger, self-sufficient households, it would berarer and possibly associated with the celebration of a slaughter, a *Schlachtfest*, when meat was preserved for the year and the pieces liable to spoil fast shared out among friends and neighbours.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/19/chitterlings-in-herb-sauce/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/19/chitterlings-in-herb-sauce/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1itel5v/chitterlings_in_vinegar_herb_sauce_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739994250.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1itel5v/chitterlings_in_vinegar_herb_sauce_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pancake Dishes (14th-15th c.)", "selftext": "It is just a short post today \u2013 and probably none until Wednesday \u2013 but before I give you two more recipes, a brief note: A [recipe in the Munich Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/26/a-pancake-dish-from-cgm-384-ii/) manuscript (II.13) that I thought described a pancake dish seems to be closely related in wording to [one for fish roe cakes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/12/fish-roe-pancakes-in-roux-sauce/) that survives in Meister Hans and the Dorotheenkloster MS. The former does not mention fish roe and omits the clear instructions on making roux sauce. This may be due to garbling in the transmission process, perhaps a misunderstanding of dictation, and could mean that the roux process was not widely understood at the time.\n\nNow to the recipe for today: The Dorotheenkloster MS has two recipes for one of my favourite side dishes, *kol reys*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akyegap0zjje1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613e684bf1a6ae2e4a6488ef45f10e32a983e4c2\n\n***143 Again a kol reis***\n\n***Take eggs, make thin pancakes (pletter) and cut them small. Throw them into milk that is sweet. Take semel bread and stir it in. Mix it with egg yolks and boil it well. Add fat (in einem smalz dorauf \u2013 read mit for in) and serve it.***\n\n***144 Again a kol reis***\n\n***Take eggs, beat them with semel bread flour, and prepare thin pancakes of (those) eggs. Put them into milk and stir it well so they boil. Mix it with egg yolks and also put in fat. Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis is not new or exotic. Recipes for *col ris* show up in the earliest German culinary source, the [Buoch von guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (#65-67) from where they[ migrated to Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/05/pancake-mus/), another Austrian source with many parallels to the Dorotheenkloster MS. Notably, while the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) retains all three of the original recipes, they feature under different names (one of them clearly misplaced). Meanwhile, the Dorotheenkloster MS only retains two, but gives them their original name. Since these two, paralleling #65 and #66 in the *Buoch von guoter Spise*, are followed by a recipe for quince puree that parallels #68, the omission appears to have been intentional. Interestingly, there are also [two recipes for ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[*kolreys*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) in the [Nuremberg-made Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf) that broadly parallel #65 and #66 in the Buoch von guoter Spise, but unlike here, the distinction of making the dish with or without bread cubes is lost. They are included in both cases.\n\nThe dish itself is simple and attractive. Here, we learn that the \u2018sheets\u2019 of eggs involve flour so we are talking about what we recognise as pancakes. Our instinct is to make this a sweet dish, but it really does not have to be \u2013 it works well as a savoury side dish. In the fifteenth century, sweetness had not been cordoned off in the dessert course yet anyway, so even sweetened, this could have featured in a main course. But above all, these parallels tell us how cookbooks were taken apart and reassembled, copied by dictation and possibly from memory in the German tradition.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/16/two-more-kol-reys-recipes/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/16/two-more-kol-reys-recipes/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ir0bmb/pancake_dishes_14th15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739734222.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ir0bmb/pancake_dishes_14th15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cheesy Cabbage (15th c.)", "selftext": "I was rather busy yesterday and couldn\u2019t finish my post, so I\u2019ll give you my brief report today. I tried out the recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS I [posted two weeks ago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/31/cabbage-with-meat-and-eggs/):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdrutara9dje1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b2df81b29e6af92fc772ceabd089ee4a10bed17\n\n  \n***92 Of young white cabbage (kraut)***\n\n***Take young white cabbage and cut it into wedges. Lay it in the pot and let it boil, then pour off the water. Have ready boiled meat in a different pot, mutton or beef, and lay the meat in with the cabbage. Then take eggs and boil them hard. Peel them and fry them in a pan whole. When the meat and the cabbage are nearly boiled, put in the eggs and hard cheese and let it boil together again. Make it quite fat. But if you do not want to cook it with meat, put on eggs prepared in the pan as described before and the cheese, and serve it.***\n\nI speculated about the form this dish was supposed to take back then, and it made me sufficiently curious to want to try it out. Two shopping trips later, I got started. For meat, I opted for a pound of stewing-grade mutton which was likely still a lot nicer than what medieval people got from sheep primarily kept for milk and wool. The cabbage wasa small head *Spitzkohl*, a type of white cabbage with looser leaves than the typical heads we get today, though I suppose savoy cabbage would also do fine. The eggs were free-range chicken eggs, larger than the ones the original would have used, and the cheese leftover Babybel snack cheese because I needed a way to get rid of it now my son decided he no longer likes it. This is not as far off the mark as one would think; A \u2018hard\u2019 cheese in medieval terms would be one that held together as a loaf, not necessarily something like parmeggiano or Schabziger. We know from later documents that relatively soft, mild and fat cheeses were popular. While this was still a long way from the industrial pellets I used, it would not be a different world. That said, I believe the cheese is the place where this recipe can be most effectively varied and improved.\n\nMy first assumption was that the recipe decribed slow stewing, perhaps in the ubiquitous pottery cookpots stood by the embers or in a thick-walled brass vessel. I oped for a cast-iron pot to replicate the process and first simmered the coarsely chopped cabbage in salt water. Meanwhile, I also cooked the meat, again a slow simmer in salt water, though this likely would be and probably was improved by adding root vegetables and onions. After draining and cursorily squeezing out the cabbage, I returned it to the pot together with the meat and its broth and kept it simmering away for about an hour. At that point,l the meat was very tender, the cabbage soft and almost gelatinous, and the broth had reduced to a small amount of intensely flavourful sauce.\n\nI was unsure what frying hard-boiled eggs in a pan would achieve and found that this is actually difficult to do. They stick, the white tears off on patches, and any browning is uneven. I suspect it was meant to be done with much more fat than I used, and I could see it working very well if the egg were floating in hot oil. I did not care for the taste much, though. Adding the cheese to the hot cabbage was a success. I was uncertain what it would do, and positively surprised that it melted and dissolved, coating the cabbage and imparting its flavour and richness. I decided no further addition of fat was needed, though dependsing on the proportion of vegetable to meat and cheese this might well be called for. I had a very generous 500g of meat (including bone) to 1.2kg of cabbage and about 100g of cheese, and it was very rich.\n\nThe resulting dish was very far from where upper class medieval cuisine usually takes us. There\u2019s no play of colours, no blend of spices, no smooth texture or appealing shape. It was, however, a very satisfying meal for a cold night served with fresh brown bread (made with German Type 1050 wheat flour, broadly similar to fine bread by medieval lights). While not upper-class cuisine, this was in no way a poor meal. Eating like this took resources not everyone had. It may reflect the way rich people ate on a daily basis more accurately than many more commonly found recipes involving luxurious ingredients.\n\nThis first trial can be improved. Above all, the dish can use more seasoning, and there\u2019s every reason to think that would have happened. Whether through vegetables cooked with the meat or seasonings added to the cabbage, this is an easy dish to liven up. I would suggest depth through a bunch of *Suppengr\u00fcn* (carrot, parsley, leek, and celeriac) and some pepper and caraway at the end.\n\nThe flavour of mutton came through surprisingly weakly, and leaving out the meat in exchange for more cheese would not be an issue. Adding a different kind of cheese is likely to do the most good. I don\u2019t think a very mature cheese would do much good \u2013 it would be hard tro melt and the nuances of flavour will be lost \u2013 but something with more character should do fine. The dish certainly can take it.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "A Strange Morel Recipe (15th  c.)", "selftext": "Roses are red, violets are \u2013 cooked with mushrooms? From the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***136 A mues of violets***\n\n***Take thick almond milk mixed well with rice flour and add enough fat to it. Colour it with violet flowers. That is a violet mues. Do not oversalt it.***\n\n***137 About a violet mues***\n\n***Take morels, boil them in well water, press them out in cold water, and then put them into thick almond milk that is made well with wine. Boil it and add enough spices. Colour it with violet flowers. Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nUsing flowers to colour foods is not unexpected in medieval cuisine. Many showy recipes depended on specific colours, with blue typically derived from cornflowers. Violets are not as common, and given the wide variety of that family, it is hard to be sure which species of *Viola* is meant by *veyal* or *veyerl*. The first recipe is much what stereotype suggests, showy white almond milk and rivce flour forming the base for an extraneous colour.\n\nThe addition of boiled morels to the second is striking in its incongruity, not just by modern standards, but also in comparison to most medieval recipes. Not because of the ingredients as such \u2013 morels show up with reasonable frequency, usually cooked whole and filled with some stuffing \u2013 but in their combination. It would suggest some kind of scribal error \u2013 recipes that blend into each other without warning do crop up every now and then \u2013 but the text looks too coherent for that. I guess it really was meant that way. Thoroughly parboiling the morels should take care of their toxins and pressing them out would reduce both the water content that could dilute the almond milk and the risk of them \u2018bleeding\u2019 colour. Lying in a violet sauce of almond milk, they must certainly have looked striking.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/13/violet-mues/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/13/violet-mues/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iou2cn/a_strange_morel_recipe_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739482056.0, "score": 24, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iou2cn/a_strange_morel_recipe_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

Cut it into squares. Fry flour with oil in a pan so it blackens and make it (into a sauce) with fish broth. Make a pepper sauce (ain pheffer) from the flour with wine and vinegar and with spices. Let it boil and cut a semel loaf into cubes, fry it in oil, and scatter them on the food. Serve it.***\n\nThis is a fast day dish of three parts: A pancake made with fish roe, cut into pieces, served in a roux sauce made with oil and fish broth, thus also fit for a fast day, and fried croutons (*semel* was the finest grade of bread on regular sale, quite white and light). This is not what we would expect under this heading, but the Dorotheenkloster MS is often good for such surprises.\n\nThe pancake made with fish roe is not very surprising. There are other recipes where it is used more or less in place of eggs, and this is how you would make pancakes. The sauce \u2013 a *pheffer*, i.e. thick and spicy \u2013 is clearly a dark roux. This, too, is not that surprising. We have [other ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/02/honey-sauce-for-fish-from-cgm-384-ii/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/28/fish-furhess-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)for what [looks very much like roux sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/06/kuchenmaistrey-in-print-and-pea-patties/) in medieval sources. The legend that this was invented in seventeenth-century France is simply wrong.\n\nWe can also be quite sure that this recipe was not interpolated later because there is an almost verbatim parallel in the Meister Hans collection:\n\n***#17 A dish of fish roe make masterfully thus***\n\n***Item take fish roe, but not barbel roe, and pound it in a mortar and fry it in a pan (as) a broad sheet, and cut it into cubes. Burn (brown \u2013 prenn ain) flour in a pan with oil so that it turns black and take a broth (pr\u00fce) of fish. Make a pepper sauce with the flour. Take vinegar and spices and have it boil up, and boil it (the cubed roe?) in that. Cut a white wheat loaf (semlein) into cubes and brown the oil (brown it in oil) and pour it over the dish.***\n\nAs to what it would taste like \u2013 probably not as good as it would if it were made with butter and meat broth, but not bad at all. Hot, rich, spicy, with a mix of textures between soft pancake, unctuous sauce, and crunchy bread, it could make a very good dish for a cold day. It isn\u2019t fit for grand presentation, but likely would have served for more private meals while the fish that had provided the roe would be reserved for fancier dining.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

This is one of the most interesting, and I am departing from the Dorotheenkloster MS to honour a vegetarian friend\u2019s birthday with it. From the 1598 Koestlich New Kochbuch by Anna Wecker:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syxokh9qlkie1.jpg?width=819&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca998723aab550c13167547870697cf2151f917c\n\n***A hearty dish of dried dough***\n\n***Take eggs, as many as you like, the yolk is best, add enough pepper, ginger, saffron, nutmeg and mace together with all kinds of good spices that please you, salt it a little and stir it into a dough with good flour. Try it, if it is not strong enough with spices, season it more as long as it is not strong enough. It should be very dry. If you would have a little sugar in it, that is your choice.***\n\n***Then work it as dry as you can, roll or twist it into thin ribbons about as thick as a proper knife\u2019s back, cut it as thin as wood shavings (*****Hobelspaen*****) or very finely cut root vegetables. Roll out the ribbons of dough three or four fingers wide, then cut them across. That way you get different lengths. Lay it out on paper sheets and place it in a baking oven after the bread has come out, or in winter into a stove\u2019s inside (*****Ofenroehr oder kachel*****). Do not let it burn, but see that they turn nicely crisp to the extent that the dough allows because of the saffron.***\n\n***Keep them in a box in a dry place and they stay good for a quarter of a year or longer. When you have a weak meat soup, throw one or ten or twelve into it. And if you want to serve it, let it boil up once or three times, that way they swell up and the broth tastes very good. (Even) if it is not bad in itself, it becomes better still. Serve it over sops.***\n\n***Another***\n\n***Take a handful of these or more, as you please, put it into a small pot or glazed pan that is (big) enough, add good fat broth, cut parsley roots into it if you wish, leave them as is proper, put it on a platter with more broth so that it is like barley (porridge to be eaten) with bread slices or spoons. It is good, just do not let it cook too soft.***\n\nFor all the detail and complexity of the instructions, it is a fairly basic recipe: dried noodles with strong spices. You boil them in broth to give it body and flavour, and optionally add parsley roots (which I highly recommend). A third preparation is slightly more complex:\n\n***Differently***\n\n***Let it just swell up a little together, not completely, then leave it so or cut it like (the size of) lentils or a little bigger, depending on how thick they are so that they stay nice and round, and throw them into hot fat so that they brown quickly. Lift them out again with a slotted spoon into the aforementioned broth and let it boil again. If you wish, season it more, the broth becomes opaque and thick from it, if you please. Cut parsley or spinach into it, very finely. It is good, though nobody can judge with certainty, and it gives a sick man the desire to walk.***\n\nHere, the noodles are first parboiled, then quickly fried in fat and returned to the broth which is enriched with leafy greens. I could see the attraction, especially if you added a good deal of spinach and maybe grated some cheese on top.\n\nWe know from the context that these are meant for sick people, but I do not think they were ever reserved exclusively for medicinal purposes. They are too attractive for that. A box of them in the house would be a luxurious treat, a quick, but flavourful and rich dish for any day you aren\u2019t quite up to a full meal or a little under the weather, and need reminding that you had cash to spare. Even in the late sixteenth century, that much spice was not cheap.\n\nAnna Wecker\u2019s Koestlich New Kochbuch is almost certainly not the first cookbook authored by a woman, but it is the first one for which we are certain of the fact. She was the widow of a renowned physician who had written many books, possibly with her help, and the name recognition helped her to launch what would become a culinary best seller.

{"title": "Probably a Medieval Kn\u00f6del Recipe (15th  c.)", "selftext": "Here\u2019s a tantalising opportunity to interpret on very thin ice. The Dorotheenkloster MS includes a brief recipe for \u2013 something:\n\n[\\\\\"Die Kn\u00f6delesserin\\\\\" - the dumpling eater. Thirteenth-century fresco from Hocheppan, South Tyrol](https://preview.redd.it/swbljdwmi3ie1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b2af2d4829516be2bfb4c1d61279f44f7d1338f)\n\n***113 A plain (slechtz) dish***\n\n***Take good broth, saffron, sage, and vinegar that is moderately sour and let it boil up. Mix (tempirs) eggs, fine bread, and cut bacon into it. Lay it in boiling water, let it boil up, and serve it.***\n\nIt is hard to say what this is supposed to become. Depending on how you interpret the proportions of ingredients and the process, it could be a soup, a custard, or a kind of bread porridge. The name doesn\u2019t help. The dish is *slecht* \u2013 a misleading word to modern Germans that means smooth or plain. The latter interpretation looks more plausible given no pureeing is involved.\n\nNow, the instruction at the end is interesting: Lay (*leg*) it in boiling water. Culinary vocabulary is not very detailed in Middle High German, but this verb implies placing a piece or unit of something in the water, not adding a liquid or something to be dissolved. Making a solid mass requires a small amount of broth, vinegar, and egg to be added to a larger quantity of bread, and that would give us dumplings \u2013 *Semmelkn\u00f6del*. Seasoned with sage and enriched with bacon, they would look familiar to us, but of course they are rather speculative.\n\nThe idea of using bread to make things like dumplings, porridges and pancakes was not exotic in medieval Germany, quite the contrary. Grated bread was used to thicken sauces and soups, [travellers carried it as emergency cooking supplies](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/07/dried-breadcrumb-supplies/). A kind of bread pudding \u2013 cut bread and bacon bound with egg and cooked in a calf\u2019s stomach \u2013 features in [my favourite fifteenth-century \u201cno shit, there I was\u201d kitchen story](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/11/medieval-nose-to-tail-cooking/). It is notably similar to what is described here.\n\nBread dumplings are also amply attested later. We have recipes from[ several sixteenth](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/31/peasant-dumplings/)\u2013[century sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/13/dumpling-recipes-from-the-oeconomia-part-three/), and I have already successfully [tried out](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/10/experiment-bread-dumplings/) [some of them](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/12/experiment-peasant-dumplings/). It is not surprising to find them attested in the fifteenth century. They are quite expected. Still, it is cool to find what may be an actual recipe. Dry bread, moistened with hot broth and vinegar, seasoned with sage, coloured with saffron, mixed with bacon cubes and egg, shaped into dumplings and cooked in water; It sounds plain but attractive. Quite the *slechtz ch\u00f6stel*.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/.../02/09/possibly-semmelknodel/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/09/possibly-semmelknodel/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1FnBE3nEiMgj7aLpt3jSWM8XkdjAl9GHDQBoEqA_6djVLecfBMqNQFeWg_aem_8X8enT-BHqHJxGBqzB8z-A)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ilcg5x/probably_a_medieval_kn\u00f6del_recipe_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739099194.0, "score": 67, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ilcg5x/probably_a_medieval_kn\u00f6del_recipe_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

Take it out on the third day, remove (literally: pull off, zeuch im \u2026 ab) the skin so it stays in one piece. Chop off the tail at the length of one span. Take it apart (split it) and take out the bones. Leave none in, but see that one side stays whole, and lay it on a bowl. Take the other part and cut four parts of it crosswise. Put them into a pot so that the stomach stays whole and lay it into the pot with the other (pieces) and let it boil. When you grasp it and it parts (flakes), take it out into a wooden vessel, add clean water, and then remove the bones. (Cut) slices as thin as you can, and what large slices you have, you fry in oil. Sprinkle a small amount of flour on it. Fry them in fat or oil, what you have. Prepare a black pepper sauce for it and add good spices to it. Do not oversalt it and serve it.***\n\n***130 Yet another gmues***\n\n***Loosen the other slices (of the stockfish) as best you can. Add almond milk of \u00bd pound (talentum) to it, let it boil in that, and add clean fat to the milk. Do not oversalt it.***\n\n***131 Another gmues***\n\n***Take the pieces (drumer) that have no bones. You can make a good gmues of those, or a good fried dish (gepachens).

That way you can well (cook) a mues.***\n\nStockfish was a common food on fast days, often more readily available than expensive fresh fish, and is [mentioned in many recipe collections](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=stockfish). It was not universally popular and is often considered a lesser option, food fit for servants. The lengthy process of softening it in several [changes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/08/stockfish-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) of [water ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/27/roast-battered-stockfish/)[or ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/10/stockfish-pastry/)[even ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/02/rumpolt-on-cooking-plateissen/)[in ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/13/stockfish-from-the-oeconomia/)[lye ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/11/preparing-dried-fish-after-the-oeconomia/)was challenging, and the result not to everyone\u2019s liking. The Dorotheenkloster MS, though, shows genuine relish at the possibilities.\n\nThe first recipe is particularly interesting: once softened, the fish has its skin removed and is carefully debones and cut in pieces \u2013 one side left entire, the other cut up in chunks small enough to fit a cookpot. The instructions to leave the skin in one piece and to see the stomach is undamaged are rather strange. The first serves no visible purpose and the second is clearly impossible \u2013 stockfish were gutted before drying and their stomachs never reached Germany. Both are also found in [recipes for filled fish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/14/another-filled-pike/). They make sense when the flesh of fresh fish is turned into a stuffing and sewn back into the skin and the stomach used to make a kind of sausage. I suspect some kind of interpolation took place.\n\nStill, the stockfish is treated much like fresh fish. After parboiling, it is sliced thin, floured, and fried. I wonder how common this treatment was, despite the fact that we do not often find it described. They are served in a black pepper sauce \u2013 a spicy, thickened sauce where \u2018black\u2019 usually referred to it being prepared with blood.\n\nThe following recipes seem more commonplace. The smaller pieces are boiled in almond milk and chopped or, presumably, mashed. That at least is what the word *gmues* suggests, though clearly the term was very flexible. It is interesting how many methods of preparing stockfish are recorded and how much creativity was expended on them.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Beans in a Beer Sauce (15th  c.)", "selftext": "Another set of interesting recipes from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/green-beans-in-a-beer-vinegar-sauce-15th-c-v0-gg3bl9epadhe1.jpg?width=426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=524d979126563dafff051a20a425132ee659d814)Green beans in beer-vinegar sauce (top) with reuschkuochen and snalenbergs sauce\n\n***106 Of green beans***\n\n***Boil green beans with fine bread, pepper, and three times as much caraway (or cumin? kumel), saffron, salt, vinegar, and beer. Grind those (ingredients) together. Drain the beans. Pour on the ground, boiled ingredients (i.e. the sauce). Serve it.***\n\n***107 Also make green peas this way***\n\n***108 Of hard beans (read pon for buttern) and when you want to make butter from it***\n\n***Make dried (gedigen) beans this way: Put them into boiling lye until the shells come off, and pour them out on a sieve or a colander (?reitt). Rub off their shells. Boil them with the above seasoning and serve them. You can make butter from those beans.***\n\nBeans were a very common food in the fifteenth century. These were, of course, broad beans (Vicia faba), not the more popular phaseolus beans which are New World cultivars. Here, interestingly, though not surprisingly, there is a recipe for fresh beans and one for dried. Both are served with the same sour sauce of vinegar, beer, and *kumel*, which at this point could mean either cumin or caraway. Given the simplicity of the recipe (except for the rather random addition of saffron), I suspect caraway in this case, but that is purely conjectural.\n\nThe recipe for fresh beans has a [close parallel](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/19/beans-in-a-pfeffer-sauce/) in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf), also from Austria. Both are paralleled in Meister Hans, and I am increasingly convinced that the original of that text is significantly earlier than 1460, possibly even 1400.\n\n***97 Of beans***\n\n***Item boil green beans with nice (=white) bread, pepper, three times as much caraway (or cumin?), saffron, salt, vinegar and beer. Grind it together. Dry the (cooked) beans, pour the boiled-up cooked (sauce) over them and serve it. Also cook green peas like this.***\n\n***98 Of hard beans***\n\n***Item of hard beans, make them thus: put them into boiling lye until their shells come off. Then pour them into a sieve and rub the shells off them. Boil them with the aforementioned wine sauce and serve it. (From) these beans, you can (also) make bean butter.***\n\nNote the second recipe now mentions a wine sauce though wine is not included in the sauce described earlier. This is probably a transmission error, just as the repetition of \u2018butter\u2019 in the Dorotheenkloster MS likely is a scribal error. Other than that, these recipes are not just functionally the same thing, they are practically identical.\n\nAs to its culinary qualities, I actually [made this for a crafting meeting of my medieval club](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/25/a-meatless-recipe-testing-session/) last February and rather enjoyed it. Using a modern beer makes it more bitter than it would have been using a medieval brew, but the combination of spiciness, acidity, and fresh beans in a creamy bread-thickened sauce is attractive as a side dish.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iihsao/beans_in_a_beer_sauce_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1738782082.0, "score": 27, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iihsao/beans_in_a_beer_sauce_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

From the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***78 A m\u00fcs of pears***\n\n***Take a clean, dry pot and put pears in it. Remove the stems and the flowers (the remnants of the flower at the bottom). The pot must not be greasy. Lay the pears in it and shut the pot well with wooden pieces (verspetl) so the cannot fall out. You must have a pot of water ready that is boiling. Set the pears atop (oben auf) the pot with water that is boiling, that way they cook (praten) in the steam. Take them down when they are soft. Let them cool, pound them small and pass them through a cloth. And you must have honey ready, let that boil until it turns brown. This will give the dish a brown colour. If you want it to be yellow, add saffron. You can serve it hot or cold. When you serve it, sprinkle on (spice) powder on it. You may use ginger, sugar (and?) cloves for that. Also put that on it.***\n\nCombining pears with caramelised honey and spices is bound to be good. This is not an exciting recipe in that sense, and you can do more interesting things with the fruit than mash them. What is interesting is the technique of steaming them: secured with several wooden skewers or just branches across the opening of a pot that is then inverted over another pot with boiling water. This is a method described in more detail by [Walter Ryff in the mid-sixteenth century](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/13/quince-electuary-after-walter-ryff/), but was already known well enough to be casually mentioned over a century earlier. This is important to remember: We may find it hard to see how the equipment of a medieval kitchen would allow for anything but the simplest dishes, but our forebears were resourceful, creative people.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Lay it in the pot and let it boil, then pour off the water. Have ready boiled meat in a different pot, mutton or beef, and lay the meat in with the cabbage. Then take eggs and boil them hard. Peel them and fry them in a pan whole. When the meat and the cabbage are nearly boiled, put in the eggs and hard cheese and let it boil together again. Make it quite fat. But if you do not want to cook it with meat, put on eggs prepared in the pan as described before and the cheese, and serve it.***\n\nWe do not get a lot of recipes for things like boiled cabbage compared to almond milk jelly or complicated fish preparations, but these dishes were more common even on the tables of the wealthy. This way of preparing it surely is not poverty food. Noter that the first cooking water is poured off \u2013 commonly prescribed for cabbage for health reasons and to get rid of the smell. The cooked cabbage is then served with boiled meat. Mutton or beef were less desirable types of meat, especially the quality that was suitable for boiling rather than roasting, but meat in quantity was still a sign of wealth.\n\nThe eggs are an interesting touch. Actually frying whole hard-boiled eggs would not have occurred to me, but surely it works. I am not sure how to read the addition of cheese. It is possible to simply cook chunks of cheese with the cabbage, but depending on how dry the dish is, it may be meant to melt and coat the other ingredients. I could imagine this in a pan with a relatively small amount of rich broth, meat chunks and hard-boiled eggs on a bed of cabbage, with cheese melting on top, and I think I want to try it before winter ends.\n\nAs an aside, the reference to making this dish without meat will not make it suitable for fast days since it still contains eggs and dairy. Given it comes from a monastic context, it may be intended for diners who are forbidden the meat of quadrupeds even on regular days.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "A Medieval Mustard", "selftext": "There is an interesting and rather oddly titled recipe in the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/a-healthy-mustard-15th-c-v0-rfw35pcbjzfe1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b59683f8abf93384c9dd84a4db62ffe499a6a57)\n\n***96 Of a good portuns kraut (purslane?)***\n\n***You must pound mustard. When that happens, pour boiling water into it and stir it like a batter. Do this for three nights in a row, and always pour off the water in the morning and stir it again with new boiling water. On the third morning, grind it with good beer vinegar. Then take horseradish that is cut small and parsley that has been pounded with the root and forced through a sieve. Italian raisins, blanched almond kernels and liquid honey (h\u00f6nig sam), put all of these on the kraut, to each layer (lecht). You should rightly pay its weight in silver for this, that is how healthy it is. It is healthy to eat in the heat of August.***\n\nThe title *portuns kraut* would suggest a dish of greens made with purslane, but that is clearly not what is described here. We are looking at a mustard sauce, and that is indeed what a more puzzling (and probably corrupted) parallel recipe in the Meister Hans manuscript calls it:\n\n***#145 Mustard make thus***\n\n***Item, take and pound (stampff) the mustard. When that is done, pour boiling water on it and stir it as though for a dough/batter. Do that three days in a row, and pour off the water in the morning, and stir it again with boiling water. On the third morning, grind (reib) it with beer (and?) vinegar (the text supports both reading beer and vinegar or alegar, depending on how seriously you take the scribe\u2019s punctuation). Take horseradish (read kren for grains, keren) that are cut small and ground parsley together with the spices (or root? w\u00fcrcz) and boiled cooking pears and ground coriander, sifted through a sieve, Italian raisins, blanched almonds, and liquid honey (hoenig samen \u2013 read hoenig seim). Place that upon the kraut, and do this with every layer. This is rightly paid for in silver, that is how healthy it is. Also always add cinnamon to the mustard.***\n\nIn each one, we have a few issues that the respective other recipe helps us solve. First off, there is no purslane involved. The comma between beer and vinegar in the Meister Hans recipe seems to be superfluous, it means beer vinegar. The enigmating grains (*keren*) found there are horseradish (*kren*) and the ambiguous *w\u00fcrcz*, potentially spices, is a reference to the root of the parsley. The *samen* of honey is of course not seed, but *seim*, first quality liquid honey. Conversely, the instruction to layer this in a pot is unclear in the Dorotheenkloster MS, but clear in Meister Hans. Finally, the step of passing the parsley through a sieve \u2013 presumably cooked, but that is not a given \u2013 makes it clear we are looking at a fairly liquid consistency overall. That leaves the rather odd final sentence in the Dorotheenkloster MS. I assume it belongs to the original, now lost purslane recipe. Composite mustard sauces like this were usually considered winter fare, and the ingredients \u2013 parsley root, cooking pears, and horseradish \u2013 are not really seasonal in summer.\n\nIt is possible to read this as a compost, but it makes more sense as a chutney-like sauce to me. The primary ingredient is mustard made with alegar. This has horseradish added to give it extra bite. Finely mashed parsley leaves and roots give it colour and body, and the sharpness is cut with honey, raisins, almonds, and pears for the fashionable sweet-sharp mixture so popular in medieval sauces. I can imagine this rather attractive after some aging and will probably try it this year.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

I bought a five lb bag of oranges, washed them well, and grated the rind on a large hold box grater (my FIL was insistent that was how his mother made it).

Soaked them in the water overnight, but there was so little water this morning I added the juice of two of the oranges and cooked for a few minutes. Added the lemon juice and the orange juice concentrate in half quantities. I then cooked it down and, as predicted, it would not jell and was very bitter.

This is a hand written recipe and I don't know how old. I'm going to assume that it actually wants whole nuts because it eventually has you chop the nuts down and mix them all together.

{"title": "A Bustard Neck (15th c.)", "selftext": "Another short but interesting recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***243 Of a bustard\u2019s neck***\n\n***Fill the neck of a bustard or another bird this way: Take pork, hard-boiled eggs, sage, and herbs (kraut). Chop all of it together, fill the neck with that, and boil it. When it is boiled, lay it on a griddle while it is hot. Brush it with eggs or with an egg batter. Drizzle it with fat and with saffron and parsley and millet (?phenich). Grind that to a sauce (condiment) as best you can and serve it.***\n\nMany birds that people ate had long, flexible necks and cooks got creative in using them separately. This is one example of that: the neck of a bustard (Otis tarda) is stuffed with a herbed pork filling, roasted separately from the bird, and served as a dish in its own right. It is not quite clear what the baste consists of. Fat, saffron and parsley make sense as a yellow-green, flavourful liquid that would also stop the skin from drying out. The egg or egg batter would coat it from the outside, perhaps creating a crisp shell. The addition of *phenich* is a bit puzzling. As written, this could mean Italian millet (panicum). It is not easy to see how that would be included in the baste \u2013 as flour, cooked, or and entire grains? As ever, we cannot exclude the possibility of a scribal error. Perhaps, the solution is as easy as *hoenich* (honey). Still, it sounds like a fun idea to play with.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

{"title": "Apple-Onion Sauce for Roast Goose (15th c.)", "selftext": "Today, just briefly, a recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS that resolves issues with a garbled one found in both sections of [Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf):\n\n***248 A dish of a goose***\n\n***Take a goose, stick it on a spit, and boil the innards. Take 4 hard-boiled eggs, a crumb of bread, caraway (or cumin \u2013 kummel) and a little pepper and saffron, and take 4 boiled chicken livers. Grind that together with vinegar and chicken broth (and cook it over) moderate fire. And peel onions, (cut) them thin and put them into a pot. Add fat and water and let them boil so they soften. Add 4 apples, so that it stays soft, and the put the ground ingredients and the apples and onions all into one pan. When the goose is roasted, cut it apart and put it into a clean serving bowl and (pour) the sauce over it. Serve it, do not oversalt it.***\n\nAnd thus we understand that the rather enigmatic [\u2018chicken pears\u2019 of both ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/10/01/roast-goose-in-sauce-from-cod-pal-germ-551-section-two/)[recipes in Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/15/sauce-for-roast-goose-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) are actually a scribal error and the recipe calls for chicken broth. Now the sauce makes sense, though it still seems excessively complex. I\u2019m not quite ready to exclude the possibility that this recipe mashes together two or three alternatives.\n\nAs written, we have a sauce made with the cooked organ meats of the goose, chicken livers, breadcrumbs, hard-boiled eggs, onions, and apples. None of these are unusual in their own right. Meat, including roast liver, were often served in [sauces made with pureed cooked liver](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/21/another-liver-sauce-from-cgm-384-ii/) that [could include onions](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/13/liver-and-onion-sauce-from-the-konigsberg-ms/). Sauces thickened with [ground-up hard-boiled eggs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/12/tripe-from-the-mondseer-kochbuch/) [and/or breadcrumbs](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/16/garlic-and-horseradish-sauces/) are also commonplace, and those made with [onions or apples](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/10/03/polish-pike/), or more rarely both, feature especially later in the sixteenth century. All of them in one sauce is possible, and I should try it at some point. But is is equally possible that a lost original recipe described one or the other.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus.

Cover the top with a clean kitchen towel. Flip out of pan so the towel is on the bottom. Remove parchment paper. The cake will still be warm.

{"title": "A Garbled Recipe | culina vetus", "selftext": "I am headed out to a medieval club event this weekend and have time, so it is just a brief recipe today. The Dorotheenkloster MS includes this gem:\n\n***213 For fritters in Lent***\n\n***Pound nut kernels and figs together in a mortar, spice it well, and rub it through a cloth with cinnamon flower and mix it with mustard. Stir it with liquid honey (so that it becomes) quite like wax beads (? wachs pert). And whenever you want to, take a little of that and rub it with wine. That way, you have mustard.***\n\nIt does not take long to realise that this is really two recipes, and we know at least the second one very well. The [instant honey mustard](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/14/instant-honey-mustard-from-cgm-384-i/) that needs to be dissolved in wine for later use shows up in the [Munich Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cgm-384-translation.pdf) collection:\n\n***12 Mustard***\n\n***For a good mustard, take mustardseed and dry it cleanly and then pound it in very small in a mortar. Then pass it through a tight cloth (and pound) cinnamon flower and mix it into the mustard and stir it together with honey, properly like beaten wax (?recht als der wachs bertt). If you wish (to serve it), take a little of this and rub it with wine, and you will have good mild mustard.***\n\nThe first half has parallels in both the Meister Hans collection (#114) and the [Rheinfr\u00e4nkisches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rheinfrankisches-Kochbuch.pdf) (#1), where it reads:\n\n***1 If you would make small fritters (kreppelin) in Lent, take nuts and figs and pound them small with each other and season it according to your will and heat it in oil and fry them in a leavened (erhabendem) dough in the way of dumpling-style fritters (kreppelin) in a pan and serve them cold at the table, those are well-tasting fritters***\n\nThere are notable parallels between the Dorotheenkloster MS and Meister Hans as well as other South German cookbooks, so this is not surprising. It appears a number of recipe collections circulated and were recombined at will. This particular error may have occurred when a scribe paused mid-recipe, then continued at the wrong point. It suggests the copyist was either not familiar with culinary matters, or just did not care.\n\n\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/24/a-garbled-recipe/", "created_utc": 1745521079.0, "score": 7, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k70anf/a_garbled_recipe_culina_vetus/", "html_title": "A Garbled Recipe | culina vetus"}

{"title": "A Multicoloured Confection (15th c.)", "selftext": "After Monday\u2019s post about colours, today it\u2019s the recipe that uses them all. Also from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***210 A strange baked/fried dish (gepachenes)***\n\n***For this, you must have all the colours. You must prepare a filling from each colour. Take wafers for that (dish) that are white, thin, and wide (scheyblat). For each (layer), take four wafers that must be seasoned with spices. With the white, you must add sugar to the four wafers. Spread a colour on it, but see there is not too much filling. Lay the four wafers over one another with the filling. Take another colour and spread it on four wafers as well, lay them together, and lay them atop the others that are written about before. Now take another colour and do the same with that, and lay them all atop each other so that each wafer is four over each other. If you have filled all wafers and think that it is too small when they all lie atop each other, begin again with the first filling and do what you did before. Then lay it all atop each other and lay it out on a table or a board. Weigh it down with the weight of two bricks and let it stand underneath this for a night, that way it turns firm and cool. It should be sweetened with sugar. Then you can serve it sweet, if you please, or keep it as long as you choose. When you want to serve it, take a sharp knife and slice it anyway you want. Lay it on a serving bowl, that way you weave (flechest) the colours. This is a baked/fried dish made without fire and you must have all seven colours. You must prepare them through the year.***\n\nThis recipe follows [Monday\u2019s list of food colours](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/21/making-food-colours/) and clearly is meant to go along with them. It is the ultimate way of showing off your whole collection. The description is a bit wordy, but it makes the principle clear: You take wafers, the thin, crisp kind [also used for filled fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/21/wafer-fritters/), and make a layer cake of colours. I think the intention is for one layer of each colour, with the phrase \u201clay them all atop each other\u201d referring to overlap on the edges, but that is guesswork. Either way, the result is liable to be intensely colourful and very decorative. After slicing through the dry, firm layers, the stripes of colour arranged on a serving dish would display to striking effect. A similar design is [also recorded in fritters](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/06/07/filled-sheets-of-eggs-a-complex-fritter/) from other recipe collections.\n\nThe description of the dish as a *gepachenes* also highlights a feature of Middle German culinary terminology that can be confusing for modern readers. It tends to think from the result, not the technique. To a modern German, *backen* means baking, and even words like *Schmalzgeb\u00e4ck* can be confusing. In medieval terminology, it refers to both baking in ovens or baking dishes and to deep-frying in fat. Both achieved a dry, crisp consistency different from either roasting or boiling. Here, the same result \u2013 firm, crisp, dry \u2013 is achieved without any heat, so the word is used readily. Still, it is unusual enough to merit the description as *fremdes*, which can simply mean foreign or different, but carries overtones of unsual and astonishing. This was a dish to impress.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/23/a-multicoloured-confection/", "created_utc": 1745432398.0, "score": 16, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k66ba6/a_multicoloured_confection_15th_c/", "html_title": "A Multicoloured Confection | culina vetus"}

{"title": "Making Medieval Food Colouring (15th c.)", "selftext": "It has been a week without posts for which I apologise. I was rather busy. Today, finally, I am back at my desk with a new entry from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n208 Of all kinds of fritters\n\n***For fritters, you must have seven colours. You find them one after the other and must seek them out throughout the year. You find the first in summer: blue flowers. You must have a lot of them and dry them in an oven that is not too hot. When they are dry enough, pound them cleanly. Keep the colour, and prepare a puree (gem\u00fcs) of sloes and add the colour to that. That turns it blue. Add honey, that makes it sweet. Season it with good spices and serve it.***\n\n***209 If you want to cook with the same seven colours, cook them according to the time in the year***\n\n***You will always find more. You can make cooked dishes (gmues) and fritters of them. Make red out of the berries of the guelder rose (Viburnum opulus, galian per). When they are ripe, press them out like wine. Once they are pressed, boil them and add honey, that way you can keep them all year. You prepare sauces and cooked dishes (gmues) from those. You will always find green easily. You make it from parsley or other herbs. You make cooked dishes (gmues) and fried foods with that. You can also easily have brown. You make it from tart cherries. You make cooked dishes of that, however you wish. You can also easily have grey. Mix white and black together, that way it turns grey. You easily make black yourself. Cook it from honey and gingerbread (letzelten). Yellow is also good. You make it with saffron, but see you do not use too much or it will turn red etc.***\n\nThere are [many](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/26/a-wreath-of-many-colours/) [recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/25/a-jelly-in-four-colours/)for [coloured ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/06/colourful-roast-chickens/)[foods ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/17/fishy-rice-pudding-and-more-colouring-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)from medieval collections, but this is more detailed and systematic than [most](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/05/27/food-colour-recipes-from-the-innsbruck-ms/) [others](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/09/multicoloured-jelly-from-de-rontzier/). The planning and effort envisioned throughout the year to produce a ready supply suggests a large and wealthy household. The colours themselves are not terribly surprising. Cornflowers make blue, though I had not heard of preserving the colour in a mix of sloes and honey. Red from berries \u2013 the likeliest interpretation here is Viburnum opulus, but that is not certain \u2013 is treated similarly. Green is made with parsley, brown with cherries \u2013 most likely cooked down into a [cherry ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/07/27/a-cherry-sauce-from-meister-eberhard/)[sauce ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/12/22/cherry-sauce-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/)\u2013 and yellow with saffron. Black is produced by burning gingerbread, though I wonder what the effect on the flavour would have been.\n\nThere is a recipe in the same source that uses all colours, and I hope to get around to it tomorrow. They are also useful individually, though. The idea of laying in a supply of all of them through the year reminds us how important it was to harvest ingredients in their season and preserve them generally. Medieval cooks depended much more on things they made themselves.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Taco Soup", "selftext": "I don't have images for you; this recipe lives in my 75-year-old mother's head. But I wanted to share it, as it's simple, cheap, and tasty. It's made using pantry ingredients and is extremely customizable. It was on constant rotation in our house when I grew up in the 80s.\n\nThe basic recipe goes like this:\n\nBrown some ground meat and chopped onion in a Dutch oven or large pot. Add a packet of taco seasoning.\n\nNext, turn it into a nice tomatoey soup using something from your pantry. You can add canned tomatoes with chiles, tomato sauce or soup, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, whole canned tomatoes, even tomato juice. Use whatever you've got on hand. \n\nIf you use whole canned tomatoes, you'll want to break them up a bit, but otherwise just stir everything together. Add water/broth if necessary to get a thick but slightly soupy consistency.\n\nNow add a bag of frozen corn and a can or 2 of beans.\n\nYou can also add other canned or frozen veggies like green beans or diced green chilies, as well as leftover fresh veggies you want to use up like jalapenos, bell peppers, or summer squash. Just chop up and add to the pot. \n\nLet everything simmer for 15-20 minutes. It should be a very thick soup with a medley of ingredients in every spoonful.\n\nWhile it's simmering, prepare your toppings: Stuff like hopped green onion, cilantro, sour cream, avocado, grated cheese, hot sauce, and tortilla or corn chips. Lay out on a plate or tray so people can top their bowls as they like.\n\nI always loved putting corn chips into my bowl, then ladling the soup over and adding toppings. Some people prefer to add tortillas chips on top.\n\n* This soup freezes well and makes a great, inexpensive meal prep.\n* Make it vegetarian by skipping the ground beef and adding more beans and veggies instead. My aunt did this for her kids for years as she raised them 7th-Day Adventist, and they didn't eat meat in their home. They remember it fondly.\n* It can be made in a slow cooker. Brown the meat and onion in a skillet, then add everything into the crock and simmer on low for 6 hours.\n* Can easily be made in a multicooker like an Instant Pot.\n\n  \nThis soup was a staple of my childhood and I still make it sometimes for nostalgia's sake. I hope you enjoy it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k35unv/taco_soup/", "created_utc": 1745095365.0, "score": 244, "author": "One_salt_taste", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1k35unv/taco_soup/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Colourful Fritters (15th c.)", "selftext": "I\u2019m back from my trip to the seaside, but quite exhausted and looking forward to another outing tomorrow. tonight, I will have to just drop you a random recipe for colourful fritters from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***211 A different fritter***\n\n***Take semeln (fine white) bread that is not newly baked. Slice it thin across the thin axis, not the broad. Take two kinds of filling: One is green, make the other black. Spread one filling on one side. If you cannot have green, make yellow and spread it on the slices. Then make a batter, it can be of eggs or of wine, and coat the slices in it. Lay two atop each other, fry them, and sprinkle sugar on them.***\n\nBasically, these are fried filled bread slices, a distant ancestor of grilled sandwiches, though here the point is the colour. Once put together, battered, and fried, the finished fritter would produce a striped effect if cut through: white-green-white-black-white. Green was typically derived from fresh herbs, black by browning gingerbread in honey or from mashed raisins. Yellow, of course, was made with saffron.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/14/colourful-fritters/", "created_utc": 1744658264.0, "score": 24, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jz7daw/colourful_fritters_15th_c/", "html_title": "Colourful Fritters | culina vetus"}

{"title": "Birds in a Pie (15th c.)", "selftext": "Everyone knows the nursery rhyme and we all must have wondered if they really did that. It appears they did. This recipe from the Dorotheenkloster gives detailed instructions for making a pie that is both edible and will release live birds when cut.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/il5vssvynute1.jpg?width=1878&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aba03dfd08814b13d28a4f8d53cd2392e63ca9cc\n\n***212 A baked dish that belongs with entertainment***\n\n***Prepare a stiff dough with cold water or with quite hot water that can be shaped. Form (draw) it high, and make two crusts (choph) of it that are one inside the other. Make one one hand wider than the other. Slide them into an oven and let them bake. When they are ready and you are about to set them into each other (i.e. before baking), take two egg yolks or onions, that way they stick to each other before you put them into the oven. You can fill them this way: You must fill the inner crust. Take a roast partridge and small birds along with it. The birds should be fried in fat. Add a sweet sauce (sueppel) to it as you do with herons. Season it with sugar and spices. Cut apart the partridge like a capon, lay it in the inner crust, and add the small birds so it is full. Cover it with a broad sheet (of dough) that reaches across both crusts. Now take three yolks and brush them with it so they take on colour, and press down the dough sheet all around, that way it becomes one pie crust. Set it in the oven again. When it is dry, make a little gate in the side. (Take) Twenty live birds, and take a slice of bread that you make a door out of which you can open and close. And take 20 birds that are alive, and make the beak of one of them silver and the other gold, and before, also gild the front of their wings. Put them in (the outer crust) and cut a little window into it so they do not suffocate, or 2 or 3 (windows). Now close the little door, that way they stay inside. The 1 partridge and the (cooked) birds must be hot. Make a hole at the centre of the pie crust as big as it (the inner crust) is, and when you are about to serve, pour in the sauce so it does not harm the live birds. Take the cover you have cut out, put it back in place, and serve it.***\n\nThis recipe is quite fanciful \u2013 there are a few similarly elaborate ones in related manuscripts suggesting a lost common source \u2013 but it also looks practical and manageable; Two pie shells, the inner one large enough to accommodate a good portion of gamebirds, the outher holding live songbirds, equipped with air holes and a closeable door. This would not be easy by any description, but it could be done.\n\nOf course we would like to know more details. What kind of crust was used? The distinction between cold and hot water suggests this was more complex than plain water paste. but we don\u2019t know. Neither do we have much of an idea what sauce the inner pie was served with, though there is one recipe that mentions [honey and spices with heron](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/20/more-heron-recipes-from-the-inntalkochbuch/). Of course we also do not know what kind of birds were confined in the pie, but most likely we are looking at small songbirds captured with glue traps. Needless to say their role in the process must have been an ordeal.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Dealing with Greasy Aspic (15th c.)", "selftext": "Aspics were becoming very popular in the fifteenth century. Here is a way of dealing with one that turned out greasy:\n\n***197 A galantine (sulz) of chickens***\n\n***Take galantine of chickens. Take young chickens and boil them in vinegar. You remove their sweetness that way. Note that all chickens that you prepare for a galantine (zu galraid) must be boiled halfway in water and halfway in vinegar, both old and young ones, after they have been boiled in broth (? noch der wall der suppem). But if the galantine is too fat on top once it gels, take and pour boiling water on it, that way it becomes clear. Then tilt the bowl to one side so the water does not stay on it for long, otherwise it will melt.***\n\nThe basic recipe here is clear and unsurprising: Cooked chicken is set in a sour, gelatin-based aspic. It clearly is an aspic in this instance, though [both the words *sultz* and *galraid* can also be used to refer to thick sauces](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/08/medieval-gelatin-powder-and-the-next-book-project/) well into the sixteenth century. There are no instructions on seasoning or serving, but we can draw on similar recipes for those. Basically, this is still how we make S\u00fclze in Germany today.\n\nThe interesting part is the instruction how to deal with an aspic that turns cloudy with excess fat. That is a common mistake to make, and not always easy to spot ahead of the gelling phase. It is not very significant if you serve your aspic sliced, as we usually do today, but if it goes to the table in a bowl, as was customary in the fifteenth century, transparency was important. Pouring hot water on the surface to melt the grease, then quickly pouring it off is a ready solution to this. It takes dexterity and good timing though.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/06/remedying-greasy-aspic/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/06/remedying-greasy-aspic/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jt0r4g/dealing_with_greasy_aspic_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1743963782.0, "score": 29, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jt0r4g/dealing_with_greasy_aspic_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

Rather, it seems to be an example of robust creative culinary humour, an illustration of \u2018playing with food\u2019.\n\n[Woodcut by Albrecht D\u00fcrer: The Cook and His Wife, c. 1496\\/1497 courtesy of wikimedia commons. Lacing points are visible on the cook\u2019s jerkin.](https://preview.redd.it/r11y558s4ose1.jpg?width=2852&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dd5394725a1591f3243d97ee74a66fd1ad36ca5)\n\n***190 A galantine of deer(-skin) laces***\n\n***Take off the skin of a roe deer and scald it so that all the hair comes off. Then boil the skin well and let it shrink quite well (? scheph sy gar wol zu sammen). When it is boiled, cut off laces a span in length and two fingers wide, and make a galantine of it.***\n\nAgain, there is a parallel recipe in the Meister Hans collection, and in this case the dish is actually referred to as made of laces for hosen.\n\nLacing was a way of holding clothes together. Laces, often strings, but also made of leather, were passed through holes in the fabric and tied shut. Hosen, the precursors of modern trousers, were laced to the belt to hold them up, so hosen laces were familiar items to everyone. eating them, of course, would have been ridiculous.\n\nin culinary terms, the recipe is surprising, but not implausible. We know that [skin was cooked and eaten ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/)on occasion, if not often. The process described here, careful de-hairing and thorough boiling, is reasonably plausible and should turn a raw deerskin into something edible. Cut into pieces resembling lacing points, it was covered in aspic and served to the amusement of diners. Such a dish would testify to the skill and creativity of the cook and might even have been enjoyed for its flavour.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/03/lacing-points-in-aspic/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/03/lacing-points-in-aspic/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jqr679/lacing_points_in_aspic_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1743707243.0, "score": 11, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jqr679/lacing_points_in_aspic_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "ISO! Sheetcake & icing.", "selftext": "Okay. A few things. My paternal grandmother was a lunch lady for over 30 years. Pretty much any food I ever ate from her was a cafetria recipe. She worked between the 1960s & early 1990s. We're talking turkey tetrazini, rolls, iced brownies, peanut butter fudge, spaghetti, mashed potatoes w/ turkey (sometimes chicken) gravy. But HER CAKE. Look, I never exchanged one pleasant word with this woman - but her cake forgave all that. \n\nI am looking for a vanilla-vanilla cake & icing recipe. I have asked her kids - she never wrote down any of these recipes for them. \n\nIt's not the \"Texas\" sheet cake. It's not a coca-cola cake. It wasn't brown or chocolate.\n\nThe thing is, I bake a lot. I have tried every recipe I've come across (and I searched before posting and looked at every sheet cake and cafeteria cake recipe I could find) and I've either tried them or the finished product isn't the same.\n\nThe cake was yellow - I think any yellow cake could stand in here. This wasn't the best part. \n\nBut the ICING. The icing had that buttercream crunch, but not the sugary flavor of regular butter cream. Also, it was much softer than any butter cream I have ever made. I don't think it could be piped, for example. I've also tried cream cheese frostings - and it's not this wet. I have tried adding different flavorings to see if it was like almond or something else...and nothing seems to match. \n\nWhen she would make this, the icing wasn't thick. It was quite a thin layer. I don't know how else to describe it except that it was vanilla-buttercream-like, but had a distinctly different flavor depth than vanilla. I've often wondered if she did something to the butter. I also wonder, if the frosting is so thin...how did she spread it without getting crumbs in it? So I have wondered if it's poured over as it sets? But it isn't runny when you slice it or eat it (not running down the sides). You could pick it up like a brownie if you really wanted to. \n\nAnd always...I just wonder if it was simply due to manufacturing? Like when they changed the equipment for Ovaltine and the chocolate crunchies were lost. Maybe some aspect of modern industry has made this flavor profile impossible now. \n\nBut I would definitely love to keep trying to find out.

{"title": "An interesting fish recipe", "selftext": "To mark the occasion of today, I would like to take some time away from the Dorotheenkloster MS to present an addition to the Bologna MS of the *liber de ferculis malis*. I already referred to [the gloss in the Vatican copy](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/01/a-gloss-from-the-liber-de-ferculis-malis/), and this one, while not exactly corresponding, appears to parallel the second gloss found in this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7h8o6jyl8se1.jpg?width=467&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=330a2164e9728ff77abfa5368bac3126064f172b\n\n***Piscis Vasconum sive Aprilis***\n\n***Recipe piscem marinum magnum et durum.

It is cut skilfully into almost rectangular pieces no larger than a finger and is brushed with beaten egg and strewn with bread crumbs. See that no fish can be seen though the golden crust. It is well fried in a pan and served in fast days with green peas and rice. And it will be conspicuous to birds (lit: in the eyes of birds)***\n\nBoth copies of the liber de ferculis malis are incomplete, but both the scribal hand and the presence of this gloss suggest the Bologna MS is of more recent date. The association of the Vatican MS with Angus Og of Islay or his brother Alasdair Og Mac Donmaill, Lord of the Isles, gives us a reliable terminus post quem about 1200. The question remains open whether the glosses were already present when the first manuscript was brought from Scotland or are later additions by Italian scribes. The style in which it is written suggests the author was very enamoured of his own erudition, but far from proficient in classical Latin.\n\nThe recipe itself has some puzzling aspects. It is ascribed to Gascons/Basques (in the Vatican MS putatively to Frenchmen), though the association with Basque cusine seems far-fetched. Perhaps this is simply due to the reputation of the Gascon Atlantic seafarers as fearless whalers and fishermen. Neither can we make any sense of the final line. How is the dish \u2018conspicuous to birds\u2019, or literally \u2018in the birds\u2019 eye\u2019? We do not know. The alternative title of \u2018April fish\u2019 is equally confusing.\n\nA final note: When the Bologna MS was rebound in the 16th century, a scribe added the crude drawing of a bearded figure in long trousers and a doublet with the legend \u201cSchiffsherr vom Schneehause\u201d. It is uncertain whether any association with the text exists, but the connection with Atlantic fisheries suggest it may.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/01/an-interesting-seasonal-fish-recipe/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/04/01/an-interesting-seasonal-fish-recipe/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1joxl0z/an_interesting_fish_recipe/", "created_utc": 1743519282.0, "score": 13, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1joxl0z/an_interesting_fish_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Rufus Estes' Fried Chicken", "selftext": "Hey all, wanted to post this recipe and ask for some opinions. So in this old cookbook by Rufus Estes, \"Good Things to Eat\", he gives these instructions:\n\n\"\u201cFried Chicken\nCut up two chickens. Put a quarter of a pound of butter, mixed with a spoonful of flour, into a saucepan with pepper, salt, little vinegar, parsley, green onions, carrots and turnips, into a saucepan and heat. Steep the chicken in this marinade three hours, having dried the pieces and floured them. Fry a good brown. Garnish with fried parsley.\u201d\"\n\nTasting history with Max Miller did an episode on this recipe a couple of years ago, and the end result was not really flavorful, leading some commenters to suggest they had prepared the chicken incorrectly. Further suggestions were to mince the vegetables before putting them into the saucepan to make the marinade: \n\nHowever, another confusing part is where Estes says to \"steep\" the chicken in the marinade for three hours. Could he have meant to \"cook\" the chicken in this marinade at a low heat(doesn't seem like the marinade would produce enough to cook all of that chicken in for three hours)? Or to let it sit in the already warmed marinade?\n\nAnother blog found some earlier French recipes from which Rufus probably got the original recipe, and in those recipes, it stated to cook the marinade over fire until it was lukewarm and then put the chicken into it, which would seem to mean to just let it sit in the warmed marinade. \n\nLet me know what you guys think and thanks for any ideas.

{"title": "Faux Headcheese for Lent", "selftext": "With regret, I will have to reduce the frequency of my postings here for the time being. Life, work, lectures and unfinished manuscripts are making demands on my time I cannot ignore. I will still try to be up here once or twice a week, though, and get back to more frequent posts as the situation allows. Today, I have a recipe for fake head cheese from the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36rci7yz5hre1.jpg?width=569&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e3df47520eec17cf1a67f516a33dd9a1215960d\n\n***193 A pressed dish of fish***\n\n***Take pike and tench mixed, or whatever fish you want, but do not take barbels. Take the fish and boil them. When they are boiled, break them to pieces with the skin on and remove all bones. Then you must have one lot of isinglass and boil it for this (dish), but see there is not too much broth. Spice it nicely, pour the isinglass over the fish and stir it together. Lay it into a cloth folded double and weigh it down together. Lay it on a chest or a table and lay a board on top. Weigh it down with stones as heavy as two stone men (?) or heavier. Let it cool, and then take gingerbread, grind it small, add sugar, and boil it cleanly. Pour sweet wine into it and let it become (omission: thick?). Season it with good spices and saffron, and add a add half of a quarter pound of raisins and as much almonds. Put them into the sauce, let it cool, and serve it.***\n\nIn principle, this is quite similar to [a more cursory recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/03/30/fake-brawn-from-the-konigsberg-ms/) in the [K\u00f6nigsberg MS](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Konigsberg-Manuscript.pdf), but the technique is described more clearly here. The goal is to simulate Presskopf, head cheese, i.e. a dish in which pieces of cooked meat, traditionally from a pig\u2019s head, are held together by aspic. We have a surviving [recipe for the original meat dish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/28/brawn-from-the-innsbruck-ms/), though it adds a layer of complexity that is not really necessary. Here, expensive fresh fish is used to simulate it. This is intended to amuse the wealthy on fast days.\n\nThe recipe begins with boiling fish whole, then breaking them in pieces and deboning them. This is actually easier using the fingers, which is also why fish was not cut with a knife at the table, and since the pieces are meant to be small, the process did not need to take account of damaging them. [Meat could be shredded very fine](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/22/meat-in-aspic-from-cgm-384-ii/) for some aspic dishes.\n\nUnlike with pig\u2019s feet or heads, the broth here needs added gelatin to make aspic and it is provided by isinglass. These dried swim bladders were the go-to source for medieval cooks and of course legal to eat on fast days. Once it is ready and seasoned, the broth and fish are wrapped tightly in several layers of cloth, laid under a board, and weighted down. I am not sure how to read the specification of weight. Technically it would mean \u2018two stone men\u2019, but there could well be a scribal error or some meaning that is unclear to us in it. Certainly it cannot mean the weight of two life-sized statues. In practice, unless you were making a very large amount, a few bricks should do nicely.\n\nOnce the gelatin has set, the fish can be unwrapped and sliced. At this point, you are also supposed to make a sweet sauce of gingerbread, sugar, wine, spices, raisins, and almonds to serve with it. It\u2019s not what modern eaters would expect, but a fashionable taste in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/28/fake-headcheese-for-lent/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/28/fake-headcheese-for-lent/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jm26f8/faux_headcheese_for_lent/", "created_utc": 1743187064.0, "score": 44, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jm26f8/faux_headcheese_for_lent/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Figs in Jelly (15th c.)", "selftext": "The Dorotheenkloster MS contains this very attractive recipe:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brbebqgl13re1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d11af60fdf8ffe2bc5ead85fa4ba91bc35d7ebde\n\n***191 A galantine of figs***\n\n***Take a pound (talentum) of figs, wash them nicely, and let them boil up once. Leave on the stalks, and set them into a bowl so the stalks point upwards. When they are boiled, you must have one lot of isinglass and boil it in good wine, it should be Italian wine. Then take the broth that the figs were boiled in. Take as much of it as you need for the figs (i.e. to cover them). Season it with good spices and saffron, but not too much, just so the figs are covered with the broth. Serve it etc.***\n\nFigs, spices, wine, jelly \u2013 what is there not to like? [I already translated](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/04/figs-in-jelly/) and [cooked a very similar recipe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/24/figs-in-galantine/) found in the Meister Hans collection, so I refer anyone wanting to try it for themselves to thast blog post. It is indeed delicious.\n\nWhat interests me today is the close parallel between the two recipes. In Meister Hans, it reads:\n\n***Galantine of figs***\n\n***Item a galantine of figs, if you wish to make this, take a pound of figs. Wash them nicely and give them one boiling. Leave the stalks on, and set them in a bowl so that the stalks point upward. When they are boiled, you shall have isinglass and boil this in good wine and take the broth that the figs were boiled in (as well). And take of this as much as you need with the figs. Season it with good spices and saffron, and see that there is not too much of the broth, (just) so that the figs are covered.***\n\nThis really is the same recipe \u2013 indeed, much of the difference between the translations comes from me having refined my rendering of the same Middle German words over the past three years. This indicates first of all, as [I pointed out elsewhere](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/02/a-third-parallel-chicken-fritter/), that the Meister Hans text is not a solitary and does not originally date to the 1460s.\n\nInterestingly, the wording of the recipe is very similar overall. The small difference that the Dorotheenkloster MS seems to indicate a limited amount of saffron while Meister Hans more plausibly calls for a limited amount of liquid can be explained by a scribal oversight. Still, there are points where the texts diverge: The Dorotheenkloster MS specifically calls for Italian wine in an awkwardly appended half sentence that is lacking from Meister Hans. Meanwhile, Meister Hans introduces the recipe by naming it twice and adding a formulaic opening. I think this is best explained if we assume copying was done through dictation. A reader might well add a piece of information (Italian wine, mind!), a copyist include or leave out a formula that added no knowledge of value. That is how I think these texts were transmitted, and it may go some way towards explaining their occasional errors.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/26/figs-in-jelly-a-parallel/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/26/figs-in-jelly-a-parallel/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jkju9q/figs_in_jelly_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1743016079.0, "score": 77, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jkju9q/figs_in_jelly_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

Take their sheer (pretig) meat and chop it small. Season it with good spices and with parsley and grated bread and with chopped bacon and egg, and chop this all together. Take some of the chicken. Shape small balls in your hand and cover the bones with them so that it sticks out a little at the bottom. Lay them in boiling broth that is not excessively salted and let them boil until they are done. Chop bacon and parsley over it and serve it.***\n\n***185 A different dish of lamb***\n\n***Take half a lamb for one dish. Detach the ribs and all the bones and prepare the sheer meat (gepret) as described before. You must have Italian raisins. Prepare it the same way that you made it (in the previous recipe). Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThe idea of chopping or grinding up meat, making a seasoned paste, and putting it back on the bone to cook was a common one in medieval recipe collections. We meet it especially with chickens, with parallels in the [Inntalkochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Inntalkochbuch.pdf), the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf), and the [Kuchenmaistrey](https://ellipsisimprints.com/kuchenmaistrey-by-volker-bach/). The resulting meatball-drumsticks can be boiled or fried. Here, interestingly, the same process is applied to lamb ribs.

That would make approximately breakfast-sausage sized patties.  These were more like hamburger size.\n\nThe Grape Nuts are here for binding and textural complexity.

Take as much of that (the liquid) so it can be passed through (a sieve), add good spices and sugar, and put it in a serving bowl. Let it cool and cut it into pieces as you please. Now take nut milk, and you must have isinglass that is boiled in water. You need as much of this liquid as is needed for one dish and sweeten it with sugar. The milk must also be sweetened and it must gel. Do not make too much of that broth, and it should be white. Let it stand. Now take \u00bd (pound) of almonds and grind that, and again one lot of isinglass, pour it on the (almond) milk and sweeten it. Put that into a bowl and let it cool. Then take \u00bd (pound) of raisins, wash them, grind them small, and have \u00bd lot of isinglass and pass through the raisins (with that). The milk should be as thick as almond milk, and prepare it with good spicesand cloves. And when you put it into a bowl so it gels, cut it into four parts and take out two pieces that are not next to each other. Put in the black (jelly) of the raisins in their place. That way the serving bowl is whole again. Let it cool and serve it etc.***\n\nThis looks like it is more or less the same recipe twice, but the principle is clear. Raisins are ground into a paste and cooked with wine and gelatin \u2013 in this case isinglass, the swim bladder of sturgeon \u2013 into a spiced jelly. This is poured into a serving bowl and left to solidify. Then, a second jelly is made with sweetened nut milk and isinglass. The raisin jelly is then cut in four quarters and two are removed and replaced with the white jelly. Presumably, the two missing pieces can be put in another dish to produce a second such platter. The result, a black and white quartered serving bowl filled with the most expensive ingredients in combination, would have graced a wealthy table.

Cut out the core and throw it away. And pound the other with fat meat. And take (add) egg yolk and spices and salt. Fill that back into the pears. And set them in the embers and let them roast.***\n\nThis is an interesting idea and, like many historic recipes involving pears, probably calls for [hard and tart](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/02/dried-pear-recipes-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) [cooking pears](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/22/a-black-tart/) rather than the soft, juicy dessert pears that dominate our supermarkets today. These are available ast markets here, but with shopping opportunities limited, I was reduced to picking the most unripe import I could find. They did not do badly.\n\nThey hollowed out nicely with a metal spoon and a fruit knife, and the fruit pulp that I could detach from the core went into the blender with beef and egg yolk. Filling them was easy enough, and after I had secured the tops with metal skewers, they went into a hot oven.\n\nCooking them in actual embers as was done with fruit (and eggs) historically may have made them softer and cooked them faster, but in the end I was content with the result. Pear and meat combine well. Of course coming from Northern Germany, I already knew this, but it was good to have confirmation for this particular approach.\n\nThe Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch (Middle Low German Cookbook) aka Wiswe MS or  \nWolfenb\u00fcttel MS is the earliest of the very few Low German recipe sources we have. The collection of 103 recipes was written in the late 15th or very early 16th century and edited by Hans Wiswe, a German scholar, in 1956.

{"title": "Medieval Meat McNuggets (15th c.)", "selftext": "I admit this is rather a far-reaching interpretation, but it is hard to call them \u2018dumplings\u2019.\n\n[Dining scene, Hausbuch der Mendelschen Zw\u00f6lfbr\u00fcderstiftung, Nuremberg, 15th century. Note the small round objects arranged around the roast fowl. ](https://preview.redd.it/ojatwry4twpe1.jpg?width=704&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5981e0a62f0dea744ebb4ca0549103d556c11c09)\n\n***177 Of small dumplings (read knodlein for krodlein)***\n\n***Take boiled meat, chop eggs, take flour, and the best herbs you have. Mix (temperir) it together and shape small balls with it. Dredge them through an egg batter and fry them in hot fat. You can serve these little balls with all kinds of roast dishes.***\n\nAs a recipe, this is a very straightforward way of using up leftovers. Cooked meat is chopped or mortared, mixed with eggs and flour, and turned into dumplings. The recipe\u2019s sentence structure and punctuation (*\u2026, hachk ayr,\u2026*) suggests that it is the eggs which are chopped, which would suggest hard-boiled ones, but a small change would change the meaning to chopping the meat which looks more plausible. The resulting mass, bound with flour, is seasoned with herbs, coated in an egg batter, and fried. It really sounds very twentieth-century.\n\nInterestingly, they are not supposed to be a dish in their own right, but served with all roast dishes (*aller hand praten*). We need not understand this strictly as only roasted foods. Rather, it means dishes fit to serve as the centerpiece of a meal or course, broadly what we think of as \u2018main\u2019 dishes today. Here is a way of using the remnants of yesterday\u2019s roast to eke out today\u2019s perhaps not quite adequately sized piece. I can envision a circle of little golden-brown fried meatballs arranged around the platter as it comes to the table, though of course that is very much a modern style.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/20/medieval-meat-mcnuggets/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/20/medieval-meat-mcnuggets/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfzn62/medieval_meat_mcnuggets_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1742504737.0, "score": 41, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfzn62/medieval_meat_mcnuggets_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to Perfect Grandma's Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge?", "selftext": "My grandma, who recently died, had the most complex and finicky- but delicious- fudge recipe I've ever encountered. It was very acclaimed in her town, and I was the only person she ever taught it to. But while I can get the taste right, I cannot usually get the right consistency. I'm hoping people here might be able to help. Four out of six times I made it, it came out crumbly. The other two times were perfect, so I feel like I'm close but must be missing some slight variation to my technique. \n\nI've been looking into the science of fudge, and it sounds like I need to avoid sugar crystallization. Fudge experts talking about more normal recipes emphasize letting the fudge cool after reaching the soft ball stage (234 Fahrenheit) and before stirring. But that is completely incompatible with grandma's recipe below,  which is emphatic that I **must immediately** mix in the peanut butter after reaching soft ball stage and then **immediately** pour it into the final pan or I will end up with nothing but a heap of crumbs. What do people who know more about fudge than I do think?\n\n  \n**Ingredients:**\n\n2 Cups Granulated Sugar\n\n1 Tablespoon Light Corn Syrup\n\n4 Tablespoon Cocoa Powder\n\n1 Cup Half & Half\n\n1 teaspoon Flour\n\n1 Cup Creamy Peanut Butter\n\n1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract\n\n1 Tablespoon Unsalted Butter\n\n\n\n**Grandma's Instructions:**\n\n1) Butter an 8 inch square cake pan.\n\n2) In a deep cooking pan, mix together the 2 cups of sugar, tablespoon of light corn syrup, 4 tablespoons of cocoa powder, 1 cup of half and half, and teaspoon of flour. Do not heat yet!\n\n3) Put a candy thermometer in now and fasten it to the side of the pan. **Never** put a room temperature candy thermometer into an already heated mixture or you can cause crystallization and ruin everything.\n\n4) Stir until sugar is dissolved.\n\n5) Only then put the stove at medium heat\n\n6) Stir just enough to dissolve the cocoa once it gets a bit hotter\n\n7) **Never** allow any sugary residue to remain on the sides. This will cause crystallization and ruin everything later.\n\n8) Now allow it to slowly boil on medium heat. **Never** stir during this stage. Only swirl it gently and occasionally, and make sure to scrape down any residue that tries to stick to the sides.\n\n9) During this time, in a mixing bowl, mix together the 1 cup of peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of butter. Keep those in that separate mixing bowl, ready to later mix in the main ingredients\n\n10) Wait a very long time (often 40 minutes or more in my experience), watching carefully for it to get past the boiling plateau and then reach 234 Fahrenheit (the soft ball stage)\n\n11) **Immediately** scrape the contents of that pot into the mixing bowl\n\n12) **Immediately** mix it all together\n\n13) **Immediately** pour that into the cake pan the instant it seems to be mixed together\n\n14) Let it cool to room temperature on the counter\n\n15) Only then cut it.\n\n  \nI follow all these steps but, as I said, it's only come out perfect 2 times out of 6. Otherwise, it ends up crumbly (which as I understand it means sugar crystallized) despite all my precautions. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts about that?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfh0q6/how_to_perfect_grandmas_chocolate_peanut_butter/", "created_utc": 1742445361.0, "score": 43, "author": "Rtyeta", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jfh0q6/how_to_perfect_grandmas_chocolate_peanut_butter/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Carrot cake recipe - but really dark and moist", "selftext": "I'm having a battle with my memories of childhood. That is, my mother used to make a great carrot cake.

It took a lot more flour than I thought, but in the end I arrived at a stiff paste that could be rolled out. It was far from a pleasure to work with, but it could be managed reasonably well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lxecg8wr7ipe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a57fd00e42a28843bb71ceb1363ce7fb8e5507b\n\nI worked it into a small pastry case for an open-face tart and blind-baked it. The consistency was not pleasant \u2013 chewy and heavy. I think the dough may be better suited for frying than baking, and indeed some tart and [pastry recipes of the time recommend adding large amounts of hot fat during the cooking process](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/19/baking-pastries-the-italian-way/). There was no discernible fish flavour in the crust, so that concern was allayed.\n\nI also used some of the dough to make closed pastries, baked with a modern filling of ajvar and kashkaval cheese. These turned out significantly more pleasant than the tart, but there still was no real \u2018crunch\u2019 to them. I think it may be a matter of rolling out the dough still thinner than I dared, and again, frying rather than baking may be the thing to do. But as a basic Lenten conceit, fish roe can work like eggs in baked goods.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/18/another-fish-roe-dough-experiment/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/18/another-fish-roe-dough-experiment/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jeeboa/another_fish_roe_dough_experiment_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1742328040.0, "score": 14, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jeeboa/another_fish_roe_dough_experiment_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

This is an interesting[ recipe using fish roe](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/12/fish-roe-pancakes-in-roux-sauce/) from the [Mittelniederdeutsches Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mittelniederdeutsches-Kochbuch.pdf):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6v2og13q3pe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b41f08545baccd7874f15d8bd2f1e0706b235812\n\n# Item if you would make a fried cake (spisekoken) of pike roe, take roe that is finely ground in a mill. Add to it parsley, figs, raisins, what (whichever?) you have, and white bread. Stir it strongly with sweet oil and put it into another mortar or thick-walled vessel that is in proper measure (large enough). Let it fry strongly (or: long? tohope) in hot oil with a gentle fire. When it is done, cut it into pieces as thick as you think you can manage. Take pepper and saffron. Take vinegar and honey. Make a sauce of that. Serve the cake with this.\n\nI started out with the only fish roe I could get \u2013 herring. The fishmonger actually gutted the fish to get it for me. I am not sure how the qualities of herring and pike roe differ, and if I ever get my hands on pike roe I will try it. So far, though, that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nThe roe made a smooth puree very quickly. I ran the processor a second time to break open the individual eggs because I assume that would happen in a handmill. At this stage, the roe was pronouncedly smelly, but that changed completely on cooking.\n\nI made the dough with only breadcrumbs and raisins, not figs for the first batch because I was making so little. It became solid much faster than I expected, so I had to shape patties. I am not sure whether that is how it was supposed to go, though some recipes for the non-Lenten version envision it.\n\nFried in oil, the finished *spisekoken* were quite good, even better than the standard grated bread pancakes so common in the medieval German tradition. I only added a bit of pepper to see how they carried spice. The answer was: well. They were clearly fish, but not very fishy, and will very likely work well with any kind of sauce.\n\nMore pictures at: [https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/16/fish-roe-fritters-an-old-experiment](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/16/fish-roe-fritters-an-old-experiment)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jct8xe/fish_roe_fritters_for_lent_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1742152624.0, "score": 18, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jct8xe/fish_roe_fritters_for_lent_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

Mix 6 eggs into it without their whites, and add vinegar and a little water, not too sour. Let it boil up so it stays thick. You can make (serve) roast chickens with this or whatever you wish. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nMedieval upper-class cuisine had a complicated relationship with garlic. On the one hand, it stood for everything antithetical to gentility: growing in the earth, cheap, plentiful, and pungent. It made you smell like a peasant. On the other hand, they were not going to forgo something that just tasted this good. This sauce is one example of this.\n\nGarlic, salt, egg yolks, and vinegar would make for a rich, creamy, and uncluttered flavour that should appeal to modern tastes as much as to medieval. Absent oil or fat, this is not aioli but a sauce that surely required very careful heating to produce the egg liaison that held it together without curdling the egg yolks. This also illustrates nicely the complexity behind the verb sieden. I usually render it as \u2018boil\u2019, but it really covers all forms of heating food in liquid, from a rolling boil to a gentle simmer. Here, we are probably talking of slow, gentle heat to induce the sauce to thicken before it is served, stopping just as the surface begins to stir.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/13/garlic-sauce-for-chicken/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/13/garlic-sauce-for-chicken/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jakykv/garlic_sauce_for_chicken_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741895427.0, "score": 51, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1jakykv/garlic_sauce_for_chicken_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Cooking Calfskin (15th c.)", "selftext": "Just a short entry for today. This is from the Dorotheenkloster MS again:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsg65y3ndqne1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d481a368dfa2eaf66d817ab7969ee912a3515a3f\n\n***161 A good dish of calf skin***\n\n***Take the skin of a calf, wash it well and prepare it cleanly. Cut it into small pieces. Season it with saffron and good spices and with parsley.***\n\nThis is really barely a recipe, just a few notes, and it leaves out the most important step, but it is also very interesting and opens up avenues of speculation. Skin is not commonly eaten in Europe today, so it is tempting to dismiss this as a sort of makeshift, a famine food, but it is pretty clearly not that. Anyone who could afford saffron and spices could also pay for proper meat and wanted to eat the skin in this instance.\n\nYou can eat cooked animal skin. Cowskin is even considered a [delicacy in parts of West Africa](https://www.chefadora.com/omalicha/peppered-kpomo-cowskin-xs4jmwtkhs). The reason why Europeans did not usually eat the skin of the cattle they consumed was not that they tasted bad, but that they were needed more urgently to make parchment, rawhide, and leather. Keeping the people of the continent in shoes alone required vast quantities.\n\nHere, someone is making the conscious choice to keep and cook a calfskin rather than pass it on to a tanner or parchment maker. It may be a way of displaying status \u2013 this household has no need to monetise the (already expensive) calf efficiently \u2013 or a local tradition preserved in writing. It is certainly interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, the recipe doesn\u2019t record what is actually done with the skin. Cleaning is specifically mentioned, and that is [an important step with all skins](https://kitchenbun.com/how-to-prepare-cow-skin-cooking-cleaning-tips/). Laborious defleshing, removing the hair, and cleaning precede any cooking. What happens next is a mystery, though. I would speculate that the skin pieces are simmered for a long time to soften them before they are further processed.\n\nOnce softened, the skin pieces might have been fried, producing crispy, spicy bites with a chewy centre. We can easily imagine a dish full of them speckled with green flecks of parsley. Serving them in a thickened sauce, a spicy cooking liquid, or an aspic is really equally probable, though. We simply do not know.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/09/cooked-calfskin/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j7hzdw/cooking_calfskin_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741555169.0, "score": 23, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j7hzdw/cooking_calfskin_15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

They worked at different schools from one another, and both taught in a different district from the one in which we lived (and I attended).\n\n\n\nAt the school in which my mom taught, for a few years the cafeteria made things from scratch (maybe this was the norm? I don't know, I have never eaten school cafeteria food myself or even been inside of it, actually, oddly enough), and sometimes they made these cheese buns that were just about my favorite thing ever. I've been trying to recreate them since, and I have the bread recipe close enough to hit the right notes, but I haven't been able to figure out the execution.\n\n\n\nThese were fluffy, soft, white flour, yeasted rolls that were just slightly sweet. Inside, there was a pocket of oozy, melty cheese. The cheese did solidify at room temperature or, obviously, colder, but it stayed a pocket of cheese and could be reheated fine.\n\n\n\nEvery time I have tried this, I don't end up with an oozing pocket of cheese so much as an empty pocket of air, lined with cheese that is sort of fused to the edges of the air pocket. Very tasty, but not what I'm trying to do.\n\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n\n\nIt just occurred to me that I have only tried this with natural cheeses, such as cheddar and the like.

{"title": "Cooking Porpoises (14th/15th c.)", "selftext": "Another entry in the Dorotheenkloster MS, not exactly a recipe:\n\n***186 (no title)***\n\n***You can make good dishes from a porpoise (merswein). They make good roasts, quite like other pigs do. You also make sausage and also good venison of their blood and the meat. And you can make pheffer (sauce dishes) from it and other good gemues (side dishes).***\n\nThis is more of a culinary briefing than a recipe, and it is clear why: No matter how healthy the ecosystem, nobody living in and around Vienna ever got to see a living porpoise, let alone cook one. The idea here is not instruction in any practical aspects of cookery, but in providing the kind of information an educated eater would be expected to have. Notably, in the second sentence a \u2018they\u2019 slips in \u2013 they cook porpoises. We have some practical recipes e.g. in the [*Opusculum de saporibus*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-opusculum-de-saporibus.pdf), but these are not that.\n\nThe descriptions are superficial, but interesting. Apparently, porpoises were cooked as meat despite the fact they were canonically classed as fish. Their name, *merswein*, literally sea pig, suggests as much, and here it is explicitly said they are treated like any other pig. Today, of course, the word *Meerschwein* refers to [a guinea pig](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/06/guinea-pig-recipes-from-marx-rumpolt/), but they are still called *Schweinswal* in modern German.\n\nIt is possible that salted or otherwise preserved porpoise meat was actually brought to the Alps. If it was, though, it was not likely a major trade item and certainly not usable for many of the dishes described here. Rather, these may have bewen familiar to people from their travels to coastal regions of Italy or Western Europe. The upper classes of fifteenth-century Europe often travelled widely, after all.\n\n(next day:)\n\nA propos of [yesterday\u2019s post of how to cook porpoises](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/07/cooking-porpoise/), these are more practical instructions from [Maino de Maineri\u2019s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maino_De_Maineri) [*opusculum de saporibus*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Recipes-from-opusculum-de-saporibus.pdf):\n\n\\*\u2026\\****About fish one must know that the grosser of flesh, the harder to digest and of greater superfluity and humoral nature (i.e. the more out of balance) they are, the more they need hotter and sharper condiments. And this is true not only for fish, but also for meat. From this follows that \u2018bestial\u2019 (animal-like) fish and especially the porpoise (lit. sea pig, porcus marinus), whether roasted or boiled, need hotter and sharper sauces. And this is similarly understood for other fish according to how much or little they resemble the porpoise.***\n\n***The condiment that is appropriate for the porpoise is strong boiled black pepper sauce whose composition is to be of of black pepper and cloves and toasted bread soaked in vinegar, and mixed with broth of fish.***\n\n***And if one should wish to preserve them for several days, a galantine is made whose composition is: Take cinnamon, galingale, and cloves and mix each two m. (unit of weight), (and) toasted bread, half a loaf worth two imperials (unit of currency). The bread has boiled wine vinegar poured over it. Thus galantine is made with the cooking liquid of water and wine used for the fish. And the fish are cooked in water and wine, and the galantine is to be sufficient for ten people.***\n\nWhile the anonymous author(s) of the Dorotheenkloster MS most likely described their porpoise dishes based on hearsay, it is likely that Maino de Maineri, a highly reputed Italian physician who wrote in the mid-14th century, had personal experience to go on. Porpoises were eaten in the Mediterranean, along with a wide variety of other sea fish. His medical advice concerns the condiments to serve them with.\n\nThe author clearly recognises the mammalian (\u201cbestial\u201d) nature of the porpoise, though this does not lead him to place it outside the class of fish. Rather, it represents one end of the spectrum within that class and, being so much like meat, requires spicy sauces. The one he recommends is actually a familiar one to German recipe readers \u2013 *pfeffer*, a highly seasoned sauce made with the cooking liquid and thickened with toasted bread. The powerful taste of black pepper and cloves heightened by vinegar was thought to counteract the cold and moist qualities of the porpoise.\n\nThe second recipe is harder to parse, but it seems to describe a galantine of the bread-thickened type. Here, a thick sauce is poured over cooked meat or fish to exclude the air as it congeals, preserving it for a short time. Seasoned with cinnamon, galanga, and cloves, it would impart a characteristic flavour to the meat.\n\nThis is clearly not the only way porpoises could be prepared. Maino de Maineri\u2019s work is focused on sauces which were considered medically indicated with many foods, not the culinary possibilities of an ingredient. But here, we at least have an idea of what was done with those porpoises.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j6n3x8/cooking_porpoises_14th15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741457528.0, "score": 13, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j6n3x8/cooking_porpoises_14th15th_c/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Also add pepper and saffron.***\n\n***170 A different one***\n\n***Boil partridges in vinegar, disjoint them, make a galantine (galreid) with it and spice it well.***\n\nThese three recipes are not only separated by some distance from[ the ones I posted before](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/28/how-to-cook-partridges/), they are also much more concise, so much so they may well be drawn from a different original source in compiling the collection. They are, however, clearly different and complement rather than repeat the first. This is not always the case in medieval recipe collections where dishes and instructions are often duplicated.\n\nThe preparations themselves are not complicated. In recipe #168, the birds are boiled and served in a honey-mustard sauce. This is also how small songbirds were sometimes cooked. Recipe #169 has them boiled with bacon and served in their broth, much like boiled chickens were, while #170 is for a galantine (*galreid*). That termn can refer to either a thickened sauce or an aspic, but in this case it clearly means the latter. The actual instructions are so cursory that we cannot reconstruct the dish beyond the most basic level.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j54xg6/more_partridge_recipes_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1741292193.0, "score": 16, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j54xg6/more_partridge_recipes_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

Roast squirrels and disjoint them. Take onions and fry them in fat, lay the squirrels in with them and let them boil a little in it.***\n\nOur forebears in Europe were quite ready to eat squirrels, though they mainly hunted them for their fur. This recipe looks very workaday and quotidian, though it is not entirely clear whether it describes one mode of preparation or several discrete ones. I think we are looking at a complex preparation in which the squirrel is first parboiled with spices and bacon, then roasted, disjointed, heated in an onion sauce and served that way. This is close to how rabbits are prepared in the [Tractatus de preparandi \u2026 omnia cibaria](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Omnia-Cibaria.pdf), and [I have found that recipe works very well](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/10/11/onion-sauce-for-lords-and-commoners/). It makes sense for other small animals.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus.

Slice them thin and fry them in fat. Add eggs, pepper, caraway (or cumin, chummel) and salt. Stir it together as soft as poached (gestuffelt) eggs. Pass (streich) them into boiling fat in a pan. When it is fully cooked, serve it.***\n\nAgain, the naming problem rears its head. The same dish is known as *larus* in the Mondseer Kochbuch and *lanncz* in Meister Hans. Here, it is given a bland, descriptive name. Another way the three differ is in describing the consistency aimed for. Here, it is *gestuffelt* which means poached eggs. The Mondseer Kochbuch had *get\u00fcfftelnt* which makles little sense but I thought might be a badly corrupted version of the phrase for scrambled eggs. In truth, the scribe might not have understood. Meister Hans simply has foilled eggs, a different class of recipes entirely and a likely response to the writer not understanding an original they were working from.\n\nNote I am not saying the Dorotheenkloster MS recipe was the basis for the Mondseer one which was copied into Meister Hans. Surely, the number of surviving recipe books is small compared to those lost, and such direct connections are very improbable. It is clear they belong to a continuum though.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/02/a-third-parallel-chicken-fritter/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/03/02/a-third-parallel-chicken-fritter/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j1ypvb/chicken_liver_fritters_parallel_recipes_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1740942715.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1j1ypvb/chicken_liver_fritters_parallel_recipes_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "More on Blanc Manger (15th  c.)", "selftext": "If there is one dish no medieval recipe collection can be without, it seems to be blanc manger, chicken breast cooked with almond milk and rice. The Dorotheenkloster MS has three such recipes:\n\n***126 A courtly gm\u00fcs of old chickens that is called plamencher***\n\n***Take \u00bd pound (talentum) of almonds. Let the chickens boil until they are tender, blanch the almonds and pass them through with clean water. Take a quarter pound (virdung) of rice and pick it clean, pound it, and pass it through a cloth or sieve. Take the meat of the hens and chop it small. Boil the almond (milk), put in the meat of the hens and mix it together. Let the almond milk boil until it it is done (zeitig) and add a pound (phunt) of pig fat (sweinens smaltz). When it begins to thicken, pour in the pig fat and stir it vigorously. As soon as it begins to boil, add a quarter pound (virdung) of sugar. When it is boiled halfway, add the sugar and let it boil well, and keep doing that until it gives back (separates out) the fat. Thus the dish is prepared. Serve it with a good, solid spoon that is deep (nust) enough, and spread it out with the spoon so it becomes smooth. That gemuez is called plamanscher.***\n\n***138 A blanc manger (plamenschir)***\n\n***Take thick almond milk and chicken breasts that were picked apart (gezaist). Add them to the milk and stir it with rice flour. Add enough fat and enough sugar, and serve it.***\n\n***139 Again a blanc manger (plamenschir)***\n\n***Take picked apart and (probably an unnecessary conjunction rather than a lacuna) chicken breasts and good almond milk. (Put) the stirred chicken into the milk with rice flour and colour it well with colourful flowers. Add enough fat and boil it very well. Add enough sugar, that is called a plamanschir.***\n\nI talked about the issue of names before, and it is evident again here: This dish has many. Whether it is described innocuously [as a zuckermus](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/09/11/blancmanger-by-yet-another-name/), called by the Latinate fantasy name [Pulverisei](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/21/blancmanger-by-any-other-name/), or by any number of derivations [from its French or Italian designation](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/11/30/another-blanc-manger/), it is all over the place, and that seems deliberate. Here, we find a names that derive from the French blanc manger. The recipes seem most closely related to those in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) and the [Buoch von guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise), but theyare not exact parallels. Indeed, the third one specifically mentions colouring the resulting dish with flowers which runs counter to the original intent of a white dish, though it would surely make a great canvas for that.\n\nAside from the relative reluctance to adopt foreign names in many instances, what I find interesting is the variety among the terms that make it into the manuscript tradition. Here alone, we find *plamencher*, *plamanscher*, *plamenschir* and *plamanschir*. These are close to the *plamensir* of the Buoch von guoter Spise, and quite a distance from the *plamauschy, bla manschy* or (Italian-influenced) *manschy plamby* of Philippine Welser, let alone the Italianate *manscho blancko* of Marx Rumpolt. Most of these terms are derived from the French, and clearly they are spelled phonetically. This is a salutary reminder that while we study mainly manuscripts, a large part \u2013 quite likely most \u2013 elite culinary culture was oral. Nobody reading a copy of the Viandier would come up with *pla mauschy*, but someone speaking French, even quite well, could easily get there. This, too, changes in the transition to Early Modern print culture, where the joke is on the ignorant person insisting on pronouncing a word as it is spelled (usually possible in German, challenging in French, impossible in English).\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus.

{"title": "Sue Gray Tender White Cake", "selftext": "Original post was removed because link wouldn\u2019t work but I had copy and pasted it with picture in my iPhone Notes. \n\nHere's the recipe with Sue Gray's commentary:\nTENDER WHITE CAKE\n2 3/4 cups Queen Guinevere Cake Flour (note)\n1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar (see note)\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened\n4 large egg whites plus 1 whole large egg (note\n1 cup full-fat vanilla yogurt or\n1 cup whole milk (see note)\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 teaspoons almond extract (see note)\nMix all the dry ingredients for 2 minutes on slow speed to blend and aerate. Add the soft butter and mix into a paste. Add the egg whites, then the whole egg, beating after each addition to begin building the structure of the cake. Scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl periodically.\nIn a small bowl, mix the yogurt (or milk) with the vanilla and almond extracts. Add that mixture, a third at a time, to the egg mixture. Beat 1-2 minutes after each addition, until fluffy, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl.\nPour the batter into greased and floured or parchment-lined pans (two 8- or 9-inch, one 9-by-13 inch or 20-24 cupcakes). Bake the cake(s) in a preheated 350-degree oven 25-30 minutes for 8- or 9-inch pans, 23-26 minutes for 9-by-13 inch pan or 20 minutes for cupcakes. Remove from the oven, cool and frost.\nHow would she frost the cake? \"Probably with just a buttercream, or whipped cream and strawberries. I love it with just that. Instead of the biscuit shortcakes, I'd rather have this as the base. You can't say it's lighter in calories, but I think it tastes lighter and fancier.\"\nFlour note: \"Cake flour allows you to carry, or hold, more fat, sugar or liquid. You couldn't have made this cake 100 years ago, because the flour just wasn't -- well, cake flour.\"\nSugar note: Superfine sugar is best. \"The fine sugar does make a difference. The texture is more even.\"\nEgg note: \"There was this study done ... about how people wanted to add three things (to make a cake), and they wanted to add three eggs, enough to make it rich but not excessive. I remember thinking, 'I have to keep that recipe to three eggs,' and that just wasn't enough. The eggs really do a lot in cakes, the structure and the mouthfeel. They're there for a reason.\"\nYogurt note: With yogurt, \"just the slight acidity helps strengthen it, and makes the flavor a little more complex.\"\nAlmond extract note: \"Just plain white cake can be too sweet; I think that makes it taste better.\"\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/l2x5as2fmple1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1740674311.0, "score": 218, "author": "NC_Ninja_Mama", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1izk1td/sue_gray_tender_white_cake/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chicken Feet  and Meatballs (15th  c.)", "selftext": "This recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS is a bit enigmatic, but it can be read as a very nifty piece of culinary showmanship:\n\n[Foot from an 18th-century chest of drawers. This was probably the intended effect.](https://preview.redd.it/jln5oqgwajle1.jpg?width=1916&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77774c2666c64018354de6ff0f5e8252adf52db0)\n\n***148 A dish of chicken feet***\n\n***Take the feet of young chickens, then take good lean veal, chop it small, and season it with good spices. Put entire cloves into the filling. If you want to have enough for one mess, add two eggs. When the filling is properly prepared and also not too thin, make little dumplings out of it. Put the filling into the claws. Take meat broth and get it boil well in a pan. Then put the claws into it, and when you have put them in, take a cauldron fill it with clear broth, place the (meat-)balls into the claws and place them in the hot broth. That way they become crooked so they stay in place. Let them boil until they are done. Prepare a congealed (? geliberte) broth with it and do not let it boil away. Serve it.***\n\nChicken feet are edible and used to be [eaten everywhere chickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_feet) were, though today most Western culinary traditions frown on them and we export them to China. This recipe is interesting because of the care it takes and because its decorative inventiveness. The process is not entirely clear \u2013 the boiling process looks to be repeated unnecessarily, or perhaps a parboiling stage is meant by the first \u2013 but the intent looks clear enough. In the end, we have an aspic or thick broth with chicken feet, each one grasping a veal meatball. It might not go down as well with modern diners as it would with the less squeamish medievals, but you cannot fault it for creativity.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/26/a-dish-of-chicken-feet/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/26/a-dish-of-chicken-feet/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iyvu0z/chicken_feet_and_meatballs_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1740597835.0, "score": 35, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iyvu0z/chicken_feet_and_meatballs_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

The one for millet [only shows up in Meister Hans](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/03/a-lenten-feast-in-2021/), where it is a little less clear than here. They are interesting to try, with a good deal of potential for error, and for what they do.\n\nCereal porridges and legumes were the plainest, least excitinbg dishes in the medieval kitchen and especially beans and peas carried associations of humility.

The peas are actually fried, presumably cooked to solidifying in a greased pot or pan, before they are roasted. These were the desirable flavours of the time and made even such lowly dishes acceptable without causing diners to lose status.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Piped Fish Fritters (15th c.)", "selftext": "This is an interesting and slightly disturbing recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS. [Piped fritters, rather like churros](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/20/piped-fritters-2/), are not uncommon, but making them of fish is:\n\n***146 Again a gm\u00fcs of pike***\n\n***Scale a pike, remove the bones, chop it, and pound it in a mortar. Add flour and yeast, pepper and salt. Knead it all together into a dumpling (close). Lay it into a pot that has a hole in the bottom the size of a finger and force the dumpling through it into a pan that has boiling oil or fat in it. Fry it well in that and serve it.***\n\nOnce again, we find a parallel in Meister Hans:\n\n***#151 Again to prepare fish in the shape of eels***\n\n***Item take and scale a pike and chop it to pieces, and remove its bones, or the fine flesh (praten) first, and pound it in a mortar. Add to it flour, honey and salt. Mix this and place it in a pot that has a hole as big as a finger. Force the fish through this into a vessel with boiling oil. Give it the shape of an eel, and fry it well. Serve it forth.***\n\nThis is clearly originally the same recipe, though it changed in transmission. The different name highlights the tendency of the Dorotheenkloster MS to name just about any dish a *gm\u00fcs*. In Middle High German, the word does get used in the sense of \u2018cooked dish\u2019 occasionally, and that may go some way towards explaining the widespread misconception that all medieval food was cooked to a mush. Certainly this is no *Mus* nor *Gem\u00fcse* in the modern sense.\n\nThe second salient difference between the two is in the ingredients. Meister Hans prescribes honey and salt while the Dorotheenkloster MS adds salt, pepper, and yeast (*hefen*). This may well be a transcription error, but it is hard to see what word could be mistaken for it. If it really is yeast, it suggests that flour made up a significant part of the dough. Otherwise, there would be no leavening effect.\n\nThe proportion of ingredients is, again, the stumbling block in reconstructing this dish. Is it a fish paste held together with a little flour, or a flour dough using fish to flavour and moisten it? As long as we don\u2019t know what we are supposed to aim for, we can only try out variations. I tried to produce the version in Meister Hans, made with honey and salt and consisting mainly of ground raw fish. The experience taught me that while this is feasible and holds together well, it needs to be cooked gently at a low temperature or the honey will burn and the result look like \u2013 not an eel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwfb59mo3rke1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c657cf08dce8cdea51daf5848ffc0b8f9bb00b7a\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus.

{"title": "Chitterlings in Vinegar Herb Sauce (15th c.)", "selftext": "Not all recipes in the medieval tradition are appealing to modern tastes at first glance, but this one may not be at all bad:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20rn62m2g5ke1.jpg?width=696&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1012b800e504b773456236147a2ca429a681b756\n\n***133 A gmues of chitterlings (kaldaunen)***\n\n***Take the stomach and gut of a pig and cut it into squares (w\u00fcrfellat). Then take parsley, sage, mint, pennyroyal, eggs, bread, caraway (or cumin? chummel) in greater quantity than pepper. Grind this with vinegar and good broth. Pour that on the chitterlings (kaldaum) and add fat. Let it boil up so it becomes thick. If you do not have fresh herbs (gr\u00fcn ding), take other seasonings. This way you can cook with chitterlings (kaldaun).***\n\nThis recipe reminds us that when we talk of meat consumption in medieval Germany, we mean all parts of the animal. There is a clear hierarchy to them, and while we have many instructions for the prized pieces \u2013 roasting-grade muscle meat, brains, and liver \u2013 there are fewer for the less desirable bits. This is a valuable survival. The stomachs and guts of slaughtered animals \u2013 were a saleable commodity, and here we can get an idea what was done with them. The recipe is also notable for not ennobling its subject matter with high-value additions. This is not poverty cuisine, but it could easily be envisioned on the table of an artisan or substantial farmer.\n\nInterpreting the dish depends on how we read the proportion of ingredients, and whether the eggs added to it are raw or cooked. We have sauces that specify boiled eggs, so this is not as odd as it sounds. I read it as mainly a bread-thickened, vinegary sauce of fresh herbs which could be quite attractive. All herbs are ground to a paste with eggs and grated bread, then added to a quantity of broth and vinegar and boiled until it thickens into a homogenous liquid. Pepper and caraway (or cumin \u2013 the word is still ambiguous at this point) give it a spicy bite at an affordable rate. In urban environments, this would be available regularly as butchers working year-round sold the innards by weight. In rural areas and larger, self-sufficient households, it would berarer and possibly associated with the celebration of a slaughter, a *Schlachtfest*, when meat was preserved for the year and the pieces liable to spoil fast shared out among friends and neighbours.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/19/chitterlings-in-herb-sauce/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/19/chitterlings-in-herb-sauce/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1itel5v/chitterlings_in_vinegar_herb_sauce_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739994250.0, "score": 9, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1itel5v/chitterlings_in_vinegar_herb_sauce_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

That means alot of old recipes like chess bars, or honeybun cake, or whatever, just don't work right now, unless you use part of a second box, or add flour and sugar, and even then it's usually not quite the same.\n\n But..., I finally found a unicorn! Jiffy brand yellow cake mix, the little boxes that make a single layer each, are still 9oz.  Yes, you have to buy 2 boxes, but they are about 89 cents each, so it's no more expensive than a regular box, and you get the full amount!  \n\nI had just about forgot the brand existed, but I bought a couple boxes when I spotted it at Walmart, they always tasted good when I was a kid (they were 3 for a dollar then), and with our oldest away at college and our youngest working most evenings, it's just me and the hubby alot, so I figured a small cake would be better for us.  I noticed the 9oz amount after I got them home, and squealed like a little kid, lol.  \n\nGood news is, they still taste great, more like real food than the chemically taste in alot of cake mixes now, and all my old recipes work again, I just use 2 boxes.  (I've even cut a few recipes in half, using a single box, when the kids are away).  Bad news, they only make yellow cake now, the chocolate and white cake mix are discontinued.

{"title": "Pancake Dishes (14th-15th c.)", "selftext": "It is just a short post today \u2013 and probably none until Wednesday \u2013 but before I give you two more recipes, a brief note: A [recipe in the Munich Cgm 384](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/09/26/a-pancake-dish-from-cgm-384-ii/) manuscript (II.13) that I thought described a pancake dish seems to be closely related in wording to [one for fish roe cakes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/12/fish-roe-pancakes-in-roux-sauce/) that survives in Meister Hans and the Dorotheenkloster MS. The former does not mention fish roe and omits the clear instructions on making roux sauce. This may be due to garbling in the transmission process, perhaps a misunderstanding of dictation, and could mean that the roux process was not widely understood at the time.\n\nNow to the recipe for today: The Dorotheenkloster MS has two recipes for one of my favourite side dishes, *kol reys*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akyegap0zjje1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613e684bf1a6ae2e4a6488ef45f10e32a983e4c2\n\n***143 Again a kol reis***\n\n***Take eggs, make thin pancakes (pletter) and cut them small. Throw them into milk that is sweet. Take semel bread and stir it in. Mix it with egg yolks and boil it well. Add fat (in einem smalz dorauf \u2013 read mit for in) and serve it.***\n\n***144 Again a kol reis***\n\n***Take eggs, beat them with semel bread flour, and prepare thin pancakes of (those) eggs. Put them into milk and stir it well so they boil. Mix it with egg yolks and also put in fat. Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nThis is not new or exotic. Recipes for *col ris* show up in the earliest German culinary source, the [Buoch von guoter Spise](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Das_Buoch_von_guoter_Spise) (#65-67) from where they[ migrated to Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/10/05/pancake-mus/), another Austrian source with many parallels to the Dorotheenkloster MS. Notably, while the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf) retains all three of the original recipes, they feature under different names (one of them clearly misplaced). Meanwhile, the Dorotheenkloster MS only retains two, but gives them their original name. Since these two, paralleling #65 and #66 in the *Buoch von guoter Spise*, are followed by a recipe for quince puree that parallels #68, the omission appears to have been intentional. Interestingly, there are also [two recipes for ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/)[*kolreys*](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/08/22/kolreys-from-cod-pal-germ-551/) in the [Nuremberg-made Cod Pal Germ 551](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Recipes-from-Cod-Pal-Germ-551.pdf) that broadly parallel #65 and #66 in the Buoch von guoter Spise, but unlike here, the distinction of making the dish with or without bread cubes is lost. They are included in both cases.\n\nThe dish itself is simple and attractive. Here, we learn that the \u2018sheets\u2019 of eggs involve flour so we are talking about what we recognise as pancakes. Our instinct is to make this a sweet dish, but it really does not have to be \u2013 it works well as a savoury side dish. In the fifteenth century, sweetness had not been cordoned off in the dessert course yet anyway, so even sweetened, this could have featured in a main course. But above all, these parallels tell us how cookbooks were taken apart and reassembled, copied by dictation and possibly from memory in the German tradition.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.\n\n[https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/16/two-more-kol-reys-recipes/](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/02/16/two-more-kol-reys-recipes/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ir0bmb/pancake_dishes_14th15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739734222.0, "score": 12, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1ir0bmb/pancake_dishes_14th15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cheesy Cabbage (15th c.)", "selftext": "I was rather busy yesterday and couldn\u2019t finish my post, so I\u2019ll give you my brief report today. I tried out the recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS I [posted two weeks ago](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2025/01/31/cabbage-with-meat-and-eggs/):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdrutara9dje1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b2df81b29e6af92fc772ceabd089ee4a10bed17\n\n  \n***92 Of young white cabbage (kraut)***\n\n***Take young white cabbage and cut it into wedges. Lay it in the pot and let it boil, then pour off the water. Have ready boiled meat in a different pot, mutton or beef, and lay the meat in with the cabbage. Then take eggs and boil them hard. Peel them and fry them in a pan whole. When the meat and the cabbage are nearly boiled, put in the eggs and hard cheese and let it boil together again. Make it quite fat. But if you do not want to cook it with meat, put on eggs prepared in the pan as described before and the cheese, and serve it.***\n\nI speculated about the form this dish was supposed to take back then, and it made me sufficiently curious to want to try it out. Two shopping trips later, I got started. For meat, I opted for a pound of stewing-grade mutton which was likely still a lot nicer than what medieval people got from sheep primarily kept for milk and wool. The cabbage wasa small head *Spitzkohl*, a type of white cabbage with looser leaves than the typical heads we get today, though I suppose savoy cabbage would also do fine. The eggs were free-range chicken eggs, larger than the ones the original would have used, and the cheese leftover Babybel snack cheese because I needed a way to get rid of it now my son decided he no longer likes it. This is not as far off the mark as one would think; A \u2018hard\u2019 cheese in medieval terms would be one that held together as a loaf, not necessarily something like parmeggiano or Schabziger. We know from later documents that relatively soft, mild and fat cheeses were popular. While this was still a long way from the industrial pellets I used, it would not be a different world. That said, I believe the cheese is the place where this recipe can be most effectively varied and improved.\n\nMy first assumption was that the recipe decribed slow stewing, perhaps in the ubiquitous pottery cookpots stood by the embers or in a thick-walled brass vessel. I oped for a cast-iron pot to replicate the process and first simmered the coarsely chopped cabbage in salt water. Meanwhile, I also cooked the meat, again a slow simmer in salt water, though this likely would be and probably was improved by adding root vegetables and onions. After draining and cursorily squeezing out the cabbage, I returned it to the pot together with the meat and its broth and kept it simmering away for about an hour. At that point,l the meat was very tender, the cabbage soft and almost gelatinous, and the broth had reduced to a small amount of intensely flavourful sauce.\n\nI was unsure what frying hard-boiled eggs in a pan would achieve and found that this is actually difficult to do. They stick, the white tears off on patches, and any browning is uneven. I suspect it was meant to be done with much more fat than I used, and I could see it working very well if the egg were floating in hot oil. I did not care for the taste much, though. Adding the cheese to the hot cabbage was a success. I was uncertain what it would do, and positively surprised that it melted and dissolved, coating the cabbage and imparting its flavour and richness. I decided no further addition of fat was needed, though dependsing on the proportion of vegetable to meat and cheese this might well be called for. I had a very generous 500g of meat (including bone) to 1.2kg of cabbage and about 100g of cheese, and it was very rich.\n\nThe resulting dish was very far from where upper class medieval cuisine usually takes us. There\u2019s no play of colours, no blend of spices, no smooth texture or appealing shape. It was, however, a very satisfying meal for a cold night served with fresh brown bread (made with German Type 1050 wheat flour, broadly similar to fine bread by medieval lights). While not upper-class cuisine, this was in no way a poor meal. Eating like this took resources not everyone had. It may reflect the way rich people ate on a daily basis more accurately than many more commonly found recipes involving luxurious ingredients.\n\nThis first trial can be improved. Above all, the dish can use more seasoning, and there\u2019s every reason to think that would have happened. Whether through vegetables cooked with the meat or seasonings added to the cabbage, this is an easy dish to liven up. I would suggest depth through a bunch of *Suppengr\u00fcn* (carrot, parsley, leek, and celeriac) and some pepper and caraway at the end.\n\nThe flavour of mutton came through surprisingly weakly, and leaving out the meat in exchange for more cheese would not be an issue. Adding a different kind of cheese is likely to do the most good. I don\u2019t think a very mature cheese would do much good \u2013 it would be hard tro melt and the nuances of flavour will be lost \u2013 but something with more character should do fine. The dish certainly can take it.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Boil it and add enough spices. Colour it with violet flowers. Serve it. Do not oversalt it.***\n\nUsing flowers to colour foods is not unexpected in medieval cuisine. Many showy recipes depended on specific colours, with blue typically derived from cornflowers. Violets are not as common, and given the wide variety of that family, it is hard to be sure which species of *Viola* is meant by *veyal* or *veyerl*. The first recipe is much what stereotype suggests, showy white almond milk and rivce flour forming the base for an extraneous colour.\n\nThe addition of boiled morels to the second is striking in its incongruity, not just by modern standards, but also in comparison to most medieval recipes. Not because of the ingredients as such \u2013 morels show up with reasonable frequency, usually cooked whole and filled with some stuffing \u2013 but in their combination. It would suggest some kind of scribal error \u2013 recipes that blend into each other without warning do crop up every now and then \u2013 but the text looks too coherent for that. I guess it really was meant that way. Thoroughly parboiling the morels should take care of their toxins and pressing them out would reduce both the water content that could dilute the almond milk and the risk of them \u2018bleeding\u2019 colour. Lying in a violet sauce of almond milk, they must certainly have looked striking.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

{"title": "Fish Roe Pancakes  in Roux Sauce (15th c.)", "selftext": "Back to the Dorotheenkloster MS, and this is not exactly what we expect to find in the fifteenth century:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0kf9anfmrie1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67fbf1e92e667b8b57a4ceaa1061706227bc2cd7\n\n***125 A gm\u00fcs of fish***\n\n***Take fish roe, but not barbel roe, pound them in a mortar and fry a wide pancake made of it (pach daraus ain praitz plat). Cut it into squares. Fry flour with oil in a pan so it blackens and make it (into a sauce) with fish broth. Make a pepper sauce (ain pheffer) from the flour with wine and vinegar and with spices. Let it boil and cut a semel loaf into cubes, fry it in oil, and scatter them on the food. Serve it.***\n\nThis is a fast day dish of three parts: A pancake made with fish roe, cut into pieces, served in a roux sauce made with oil and fish broth, thus also fit for a fast day, and fried croutons (*semel* was the finest grade of bread on regular sale, quite white and light). This is not what we would expect under this heading, but the Dorotheenkloster MS is often good for such surprises.\n\nThe pancake made with fish roe is not very surprising. There are other recipes where it is used more or less in place of eggs, and this is how you would make pancakes. The sauce \u2013 a *pheffer*, i.e. thick and spicy \u2013 is clearly a dark roux. This, too, is not that surprising. We have [other ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/02/honey-sauce-for-fish-from-cgm-384-ii/)[recipes ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/05/28/fish-furhess-from-the-inntalkochbuch/)for what [looks very much like roux sauce](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/06/kuchenmaistrey-in-print-and-pea-patties/) in medieval sources. The legend that this was invented in seventeenth-century France is simply wrong.\n\nWe can also be quite sure that this recipe was not interpolated later because there is an almost verbatim parallel in the Meister Hans collection:\n\n***#17 A dish of fish roe make masterfully thus***\n\n***Item take fish roe, but not barbel roe, and pound it in a mortar and fry it in a pan (as) a broad sheet, and cut it into cubes. Burn (brown \u2013 prenn ain) flour in a pan with oil so that it turns black and take a broth (pr\u00fce) of fish. Make a pepper sauce with the flour. Take vinegar and spices and have it boil up, and boil it (the cubed roe?) in that. Cut a white wheat loaf (semlein) into cubes and brown the oil (brown it in oil) and pour it over the dish.***\n\nAs to what it would taste like \u2013 probably not as good as it would if it were made with butter and meat broth, but not bad at all. Hot, rich, spicy, with a mix of textures between soft pancake, unctuous sauce, and crunchy bread, it could make a very good dish for a cold day. It isn\u2019t fit for grand presentation, but likely would have served for more private meals while the fish that had provided the roe would be reserved for fancier dining.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library. Since part of the book appears to be older than 1414, it was probably purchased or brought there by a brother from elsewhere, not created in the monastery.\n\nThe text was edited and translated into modern German by Doris Aichholzer in \u201ewildu machen ayn guet essen\u2026\u201cDrei mittelhochdeutsche Kochb\u00fccher: Erstedition \u00dcbersetzung, Kommentar, Peter Lang Verlag, Berne et al. 1999 on pp. 245-379.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1io0fj6/fish_roe_pancakes_in_roux_sauce_15th_c/", "created_utc": 1739391029.0, "score": 15, "author": "VolkerBach", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1io0fj6/fish_roe_pancakes_in_roux_sauce_15th_c/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Spicy Noodles (1598)", "selftext": "It is not often that we come across savoury vegetarian dishes in medieval or Renaissance collections. This is one of the most interesting, and I am departing from the Dorotheenkloster MS to honour a vegetarian friend\u2019s birthday with it. From the 1598 Koestlich New Kochbuch by Anna Wecker:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syxokh9qlkie1.jpg?width=819&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca998723aab550c13167547870697cf2151f917c\n\n***A hearty dish of dried dough***\n\n***Take eggs, as many as you like, the yolk is best, add enough pepper, ginger, saffron, nutmeg and mace together with all kinds of good spices that please you, salt it a little and stir it into a dough with good flour. Try it, if it is not strong enough with spices, season it more as long as it is not strong enough. It should be very dry. If you would have a little sugar in it, that is your choice.***\n\n***Then work it as dry as you can, roll or twist it into thin ribbons about as thick as a proper knife\u2019s back, cut it as thin as wood shavings (*****Hobelspaen*****) or very finely cut root vegetables. Roll out the ribbons of dough three or four fingers wide, then cut them across. That way you get different lengths. Lay it out on paper sheets and place it in a baking oven after the bread has come out, or in winter into a stove\u2019s inside (*****Ofenroehr oder kachel*****). Do not let it burn, but see that they turn nicely crisp to the extent that the dough allows because of the saffron.***\n\n***Keep them in a box in a dry place and they stay good for a quarter of a year or longer. When you have a weak meat soup, throw one or ten or twelve into it. And if you want to serve it, let it boil up once or three times, that way they swell up and the broth tastes very good. (Even) if it is not bad in itself, it becomes better still. Serve it over sops.***\n\n***Another***\n\n***Take a handful of these or more, as you please, put it into a small pot or glazed pan that is (big) enough, add good fat broth, cut parsley roots into it if you wish, leave them as is proper, put it on a platter with more broth so that it is like barley (porridge to be eaten) with bread slices or spoons. It is good, just do not let it cook too soft.***\n\nFor all the detail and complexity of the instructions, it is a fairly basic recipe: dried noodles with strong spices. You boil them in broth to give it body and flavour, and optionally add parsley roots (which I highly recommend). A third preparation is slightly more complex:\n\n***Differently***\n\n***Let it just swell up a little together, not completely, then leave it so or cut it like (the size of) lentils or a little bigger, depending on how thick they are so that they stay nice and round, and throw them into hot fat so that they brown quickly. Lift them out again with a slotted spoon into the aforementioned broth and let it boil again. If you wish, season it more, the broth becomes opaque and thick from it, if you please. Cut parsley or spinach into it, very finely. It is good, though nobody can judge with certainty, and it gives a sick man the desire to walk.***\n\nHere, the noodles are first parboiled, then quickly fried in fat and returned to the broth which is enriched with leafy greens. I could see the attraction, especially if you added a good deal of spinach and maybe grated some cheese on top.\n\nWe know from the context that these are meant for sick people, but I do not think they were ever reserved exclusively for medicinal purposes. They are too attractive for that. A box of them in the house would be a luxurious treat, a quick, but flavourful and rich dish for any day you aren\u2019t quite up to a full meal or a little under the weather, and need reminding that you had cash to spare. Even in the late sixteenth century, that much spice was not cheap.\n\nAnna Wecker\u2019s Koestlich New Kochbuch is almost certainly not the first cookbook authored by a woman, but it is the first one for which we are certain of the fact. She was the widow of a renowned physician who had written many books, possibly with her help, and the name recognition helped her to launch what would become a culinary best seller.

The Dorotheenkloster MS includes a brief recipe for \u2013 something:\n\n[\\\\\"Die Kn\u00f6delesserin\\\\\" - the dumpling eater. Thirteenth-century fresco from Hocheppan, South Tyrol](https://preview.redd.it/swbljdwmi3ie1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b2af2d4829516be2bfb4c1d61279f44f7d1338f)\n\n***113 A plain (slechtz) dish***\n\n***Take good broth, saffron, sage, and vinegar that is moderately sour and let it boil up. Mix (tempirs) eggs, fine bread, and cut bacon into it. Lay it in boiling water, let it boil up, and serve it.***\n\nIt is hard to say what this is supposed to become. Depending on how you interpret the proportions of ingredients and the process, it could be a soup, a custard, or a kind of bread porridge. The name doesn\u2019t help. The dish is *slecht* \u2013 a misleading word to modern Germans that means smooth or plain. The latter interpretation looks more plausible given no pureeing is involved.\n\nNow, the instruction at the end is interesting: Lay (*leg*) it in boiling water. Culinary vocabulary is not very detailed in Middle High German, but this verb implies placing a piece or unit of something in the water, not adding a liquid or something to be dissolved. Making a solid mass requires a small amount of broth, vinegar, and egg to be added to a larger quantity of bread, and that would give us dumplings \u2013 *Semmelkn\u00f6del*. Seasoned with sage and enriched with bacon, they would look familiar to us, but of course they are rather speculative.\n\nThe idea of using bread to make things like dumplings, porridges and pancakes was not exotic in medieval Germany, quite the contrary. Grated bread was used to thicken sauces and soups, [travellers carried it as emergency cooking supplies](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/12/07/dried-breadcrumb-supplies/). A kind of bread pudding \u2013 cut bread and bacon bound with egg and cooked in a calf\u2019s stomach \u2013 features in [my favourite fifteenth-century \u201cno shit, there I was\u201d kitchen story](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/07/11/medieval-nose-to-tail-cooking/). It is notably similar to what is described here.\n\nBread dumplings are also amply attested later. We have recipes from[ several sixteenth](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/01/31/peasant-dumplings/)\u2013[century sources](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/11/13/dumpling-recipes-from-the-oeconomia-part-three/), and I have already successfully [tried out](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/10/experiment-bread-dumplings/) [some of them](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/04/12/experiment-peasant-dumplings/). It is not surprising to find them attested in the fifteenth century. They are quite expected. Still, it is cool to find what may be an actual recipe. Dry bread, moistened with hot broth and vinegar, seasoned with sage, coloured with saffron, mixed with bacon cubes and egg, shaped into dumplings and cooked in water; It sounds plain but attractive. Quite the *slechtz ch\u00f6stel*.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

Take it out on the third day, remove (literally: pull off, zeuch im \u2026 ab) the skin so it stays in one piece. Chop off the tail at the length of one span. Take it apart (split it) and take out the bones. Leave none in, but see that one side stays whole, and lay it on a bowl. Take the other part and cut four parts of it crosswise. Put them into a pot so that the stomach stays whole and lay it into the pot with the other (pieces) and let it boil. When you grasp it and it parts (flakes), take it out into a wooden vessel, add clean water, and then remove the bones. (Cut) slices as thin as you can, and what large slices you have, you fry in oil.

That way you can well (cook) a mues.***\n\nStockfish was a common food on fast days, often more readily available than expensive fresh fish, and is [mentioned in many recipe collections](https://www.culina-vetus.de/?s=stockfish). It was not universally popular and is often considered a lesser option, food fit for servants. The lengthy process of softening it in several [changes](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2021/11/08/stockfish-from-the-kuchenmaistrey/) of [water ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/27/roast-battered-stockfish/)[or ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/05/10/stockfish-pastry/)[even ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/03/02/rumpolt-on-cooking-plateissen/)[in ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/04/13/stockfish-from-the-oeconomia/)[lye ](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2022/02/11/preparing-dried-fish-after-the-oeconomia/)was challenging, and the result not to everyone\u2019s liking. The Dorotheenkloster MS, though, shows genuine relish at the possibilities.\n\nThe first recipe is particularly interesting: once softened, the fish has its skin removed and is carefully debones and cut in pieces \u2013 one side left entire, the other cut up in chunks small enough to fit a cookpot. The instructions to leave the skin in one piece and to see the stomach is undamaged are rather strange. The first serves no visible purpose and the second is clearly impossible \u2013 stockfish were gutted before drying and their stomachs never reached Germany. Both are also found in [recipes for filled fish](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/12/14/another-filled-pike/). They make sense when the flesh of fresh fish is turned into a stuffing and sewn back into the skin and the stomach used to make a kind of sausage. I suspect some kind of interpolation took place.\n\nStill, the stockfish is treated much like fresh fish. After parboiling, it is sliced thin, floured, and fried. I wonder how common this treatment was, despite the fact that we do not often find it described. They are served in a black pepper sauce \u2013 a spicy, thickened sauce where \u2018black\u2019 usually referred to it being prepared with blood.\n\nThe following recipes seem more commonplace. The smaller pieces are boiled in almond milk and chopped or, presumably, mashed. That at least is what the word *gmues* suggests, though clearly the term was very flexible. It is interesting how many methods of preparing stockfish are recorded and how much creativity was expended on them.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus.

Rub off their shells. Boil them with the above seasoning and serve them. You can make butter from those beans.***\n\nBeans were a very common food in the fifteenth century. These were, of course, broad beans (Vicia faba), not the more popular phaseolus beans which are New World cultivars. Here, interestingly, though not surprisingly, there is a recipe for fresh beans and one for dried. Both are served with the same sour sauce of vinegar, beer, and *kumel*, which at this point could mean either cumin or caraway. Given the simplicity of the recipe (except for the rather random addition of saffron), I suspect caraway in this case, but that is purely conjectural.\n\nThe recipe for fresh beans has a [close parallel](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/09/19/beans-in-a-pfeffer-sauce/) in the [Mondseer Kochbuch](https://www.culina-vetus.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mondseer-Kochbuch.pdf), also from Austria. Both are paralleled in Meister Hans, and I am increasingly convinced that the original of that text is significantly earlier than 1460, possibly even 1400.\n\n***97 Of beans***\n\n***Item boil green beans with nice (=white) bread, pepper, three times as much caraway (or cumin?), saffron, salt, vinegar and beer. Grind it together. Dry the (cooked) beans, pour the boiled-up cooked (sauce) over them and serve it. Also cook green peas like this.***\n\n***98 Of hard beans***\n\n***Item of hard beans, make them thus: put them into boiling lye until their shells come off. Then pour them into a sieve and rub the shells off them. Boil them with the aforementioned wine sauce and serve it. (From) these beans, you can (also) make bean butter.***\n\nNote the second recipe now mentions a wine sauce though wine is not included in the sauce described earlier. This is probably a transmission error, just as the repetition of \u2018butter\u2019 in the Dorotheenkloster MS likely is a scribal error. Other than that, these recipes are not just functionally the same thing, they are practically identical.\n\nAs to its culinary qualities, I actually [made this for a crafting meeting of my medieval club](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2024/02/25/a-meatless-recipe-testing-session/) last February and rather enjoyed it. Using a modern beer makes it more bitter than it would have been using a medieval brew, but the combination of spiciness, acidity, and fresh beans in a creamy bread-thickened sauce is attractive as a side dish.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

{"title": "Honeyed Pear Puree (15th c.)", "selftext": "Today\u2019s recipe is not very interesting culinary terms, but for technique. From the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n***78 A m\u00fcs of pears***\n\n***Take a clean, dry pot and put pears in it. Remove the stems and the flowers (the remnants of the flower at the bottom). The pot must not be greasy. Lay the pears in it and shut the pot well with wooden pieces (verspetl) so the cannot fall out. You must have a pot of water ready that is boiling. Set the pears atop (oben auf) the pot with water that is boiling, that way they cook (praten) in the steam. Take them down when they are soft. Let them cool, pound them small and pass them through a cloth. And you must have honey ready, let that boil until it turns brown. This will give the dish a brown colour. If you want it to be yellow, add saffron. You can serve it hot or cold. When you serve it, sprinkle on (spice) powder on it. You may use ginger, sugar (and?) cloves for that. Also put that on it.***\n\nCombining pears with caramelised honey and spices is bound to be good. This is not an exciting recipe in that sense, and you can do more interesting things with the fruit than mash them. What is interesting is the technique of steaming them: secured with several wooden skewers or just branches across the opening of a pot that is then inverted over another pot with boiling water. This is a method described in more detail by [Walter Ryff in the mid-sixteenth century](https://www.culina-vetus.de/2023/08/13/quince-electuary-after-walter-ryff/), but was already known well enough to be casually mentioned over a century earlier. This is important to remember: We may find it hard to see how the equipment of a medieval kitchen would allow for anything but the simplest dishes, but our forebears were resourceful, creative people.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

{"title": "Fifteenth-Century Cabbage", "selftext": "Another recipe from the Dorotheenkloster MS that we don\u2019t see very much of: Cooking cabbage.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/bpiled-cabbage-with-meat-eggs-and-cheese-15th-c-v0-djzt8b9acege1.jpg?width=381&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=675a95c97fd9d8e128e660471452ed8a81d5d58e)\n\n***92 Of young white cabbage (kraut)***\n\n***Take young white cabbage and cut it into wedges. Lay it in the pot and let it boil, then pour off the water. Have ready boiled meat in a different pot, mutton or beef, and lay the meat in with the cabbage. Then take eggs and boil them hard. Peel them and fry them in a pan whole. When the meat and the cabbage are nearly boiled, put in the eggs and hard cheese and let it boil together again. Make it quite fat. But if you do not want to cook it with meat, put on eggs prepared in the pan as described before and the cheese, and serve it.***\n\nWe do not get a lot of recipes for things like boiled cabbage compared to almond milk jelly or complicated fish preparations, but these dishes were more common even on the tables of the wealthy. This way of preparing it surely is not poverty food. Noter that the first cooking water is poured off \u2013 commonly prescribed for cabbage for health reasons and to get rid of the smell. The cooked cabbage is then served with boiled meat. Mutton or beef were less desirable types of meat, especially the quality that was suitable for boiling rather than roasting, but meat in quantity was still a sign of wealth.\n\nThe eggs are an interesting touch. Actually frying whole hard-boiled eggs would not have occurred to me, but surely it works. I am not sure how to read the addition of cheese. It is possible to simply cook chunks of cheese with the cabbage, but depending on how dry the dish is, it may be meant to melt and coat the other ingredients. I could imagine this in a pan with a relatively small amount of rich broth, meat chunks and hard-boiled eggs on a bed of cabbage, with cheese melting on top, and I think I want to try it before winter ends.\n\nAs an aside, the reference to making this dish without meat will not make it suitable for fast days since it still contains eggs and dairy. Given it comes from a monastic context, it may be intended for diners who are forbidden the meat of quadrupeds even on regular days.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897. It is bound together with other practical texts including a dietetic treatise by Albertus Magnus. The codex was rebound improperly in the 19th century which means the original order of pages is not certain, but the scripts used suggest that part of it dates to the late 14th century, the remainder to the early 15th century.\n\nThe Augustine Canons established the monastery of St Dorothea, the Dorotheenkloster, in Vienna in 1414 and we know the codex was held there until its dissolution in 1786, when it passed to the imperial library.

{"title": "A Medieval Mustard", "selftext": "There is an interesting and rather oddly titled recipe in the Dorotheenkloster MS:\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/a-healthy-mustard-15th-c-v0-rfw35pcbjzfe1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b59683f8abf93384c9dd84a4db62ffe499a6a57)\n\n***96 Of a good portuns kraut (purslane?)***\n\n***You must pound mustard. When that happens, pour boiling water into it and stir it like a batter. Do this for three nights in a row, and always pour off the water in the morning and stir it again with new boiling water. On the third morning, grind it with good beer vinegar. Then take horseradish that is cut small and parsley that has been pounded with the root and forced through a sieve. Italian raisins, blanched almond kernels and liquid honey (h\u00f6nig sam), put all of these on the kraut, to each layer (lecht). You should rightly pay its weight in silver for this, that is how healthy it is. It is healthy to eat in the heat of August.***\n\nThe title *portuns kraut* would suggest a dish of greens made with purslane, but that is clearly not what is described here. We are looking at a mustard sauce, and that is indeed what a more puzzling (and probably corrupted) parallel recipe in the Meister Hans manuscript calls it:\n\n***#145 Mustard make thus***\n\n***Item, take and pound (stampff) the mustard. When that is done, pour boiling water on it and stir it as though for a dough/batter. Do that three days in a row, and pour off the water in the morning, and stir it again with boiling water. On the third morning, grind (reib) it with beer (and?) vinegar (the text supports both reading beer and vinegar or alegar, depending on how seriously you take the scribe\u2019s punctuation). Take horseradish (read kren for grains, keren) that are cut small and ground parsley together with the spices (or root? w\u00fcrcz) and boiled cooking pears and ground coriander, sifted through a sieve, Italian raisins, blanched almonds, and liquid honey (hoenig samen \u2013 read hoenig seim). Place that upon the kraut, and do this with every layer. This is rightly paid for in silver, that is how healthy it is. Also always add cinnamon to the mustard.***\n\nIn each one, we have a few issues that the respective other recipe helps us solve. First off, there is no purslane involved. The comma between beer and vinegar in the Meister Hans recipe seems to be superfluous, it means beer vinegar. The enigmating grains (*keren*) found there are horseradish (*kren*) and the ambiguous *w\u00fcrcz*, potentially spices, is a reference to the root of the parsley. The *samen* of honey is of course not seed, but *seim*, first quality liquid honey. Conversely, the instruction to layer this in a pot is unclear in the Dorotheenkloster MS, but clear in Meister Hans. Finally, the step of passing the parsley through a sieve \u2013 presumably cooked, but that is not a given \u2013 makes it clear we are looking at a fairly liquid consistency overall. That leaves the rather odd final sentence in the Dorotheenkloster MS. I assume it belongs to the original, now lost purslane recipe. Composite mustard sauces like this were usually considered winter fare, and the ingredients \u2013 parsley root, cooking pears, and horseradish \u2013 are not really seasonal in summer.\n\nIt is possible to read this as a compost, but it makes more sense as a chutney-like sauce to me. The primary ingredient is mustard made with alegar. This has horseradish added to give it extra bite. Finely mashed parsley leaves and roots give it colour and body, and the sharpness is cut with honey, raisins, almonds, and pears for the fashionable sweet-sharp mixture so popular in medieval sauces. I can imagine this rather attractive after some aging and will probably try it this year.\n\nThe Dorotheenkloster MS is a collection of 268 recipes that is currently held at the Austrian national library as Cod. 2897.

I swear, even if these were German bakeries the things I'm looking for look more Danish. I'm befuddled.\n\nWe've got a family receipe for one but my mom says it's not very good, haha.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iaq5wo/old_fashioned_bakery_coffee_cakes/", "created_utc": 1737925093.0, "score": 71, "author": "LunarGiantNeil", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1iaq5wo/old_fashioned_bakery_coffee_cakes/", "html_title": ""}

There was a chocolate dough that got pressed into the cup to make a \"crust\", then a ball of white dough was put in the cup and patted down. She always put a maraschino cherry in the center of the white part.

There are probably other spices however I cannot remember specifics or amounts. \nThere are other ingredients too...probably the usual mushrooms,  sour cream...but it was the marinating and spices that I mentioned that made it a killer recipe. \n\nEdit:  As I recall marinate the beef in lemon 'the specified time' as too long can make the beef taste lemony.\nWhen you add the dill and carroway don't add more...better to add exact or a bit less.\nOne time I made it for my family and put too much dill.

{"title": "Melon Nalewka Liqueur", "selftext": "Here's an old Polish recipe to make your own infused liqueur using cantaloupe melons and grain alcohol. Translation to English is roughly this: Cut a ripe aromatic melon into cubes. Place in a salad bowl. Prepare a simple syrup with 1 kg of sugar and a glass of water. Add melon to the boiling syrup and cover with a lid so the aroma does not go away. Remove from heat. The next morning, pour the melon syrup into a jar and measure how much juice is there. Pour spirit (whole grain alcohol) into the jar, using half the volume of juice. The spirit should be poured into the syrup, and not vice versa, in order to maintain the clarity of the liqueur. Mix. Add pressed lemon juice. Mix. Set aside in a dark place for a month. Filter through coffee filter paper. Pour into bottles and set aside for a second month to age.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrjrhbkjf4ae1.jpg?width=273&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21eb25bb774d1a72d3b9741515c45486a8a73b93\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1hq7xzu/melon_nalewka_liqueur/", "created_utc": 1735623380.0, "score": 16, "author": "Nalewka_Guy", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1hq7xzu/melon_nalewka_liqueur/", "html_title": ""}
