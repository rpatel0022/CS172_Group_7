While waiting for beef to get to room temp, I sealed it in various spices, oils, marinade mix, just for an hour or so. Maybe a bit longer. Set in oven on convection roast, around 225. It went until internal temp was about 125, the took out to rest. Loose cover with foil and vented an hour. Popped oven up to 475, then put roast in to sear. Like I said I was just not well today, so it went a bit longer on the sear. Kids like it more done anyway, but I prefer it more rare. This was about 130-135 after sear. It was soft enough to glide right through with a horribly dull knife. lol. It tastes amazing. Green beans were just a big frozen bag defrosted, pan fried with garlic n butter, lightly salted oh and onion powder too. Mashed potatoes with way too much heavy cream n butter. And just popped some Hawaiian rolls in oven to warm a bit. OH! Gravy made with pan dripping, beef bone stock, various spices, heavy cream and milk, just basic. Thickened with a bit of corn starch and tiniest bit of white wine went in while it was boiling too.  I threw some shallot oil in it too.

The recipes for all 3 are here: \n\nBeer Battered Fried Walleye or Cod \n* Peanut or Vegetable oil for deep frying\n* 3 1/3 cups flour \n* 1 3/4 tsp salt plus more for sprinkling\n* 1 Egg \n* 2 bottles of your favorite beer\n* 2 pounds walleye or cod fillet\n* \n1. Place oil in deep-fryer or skillet preheat to 370\u00baF. Mix 3 cups flour, salt in bowl, then whisk in beer and egg till smooth in consistency. Place remaining flour on plate.\n2. Pat walleye / cod fillets dry with paper towel then dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip each fillet one by one into batter, then gently place in hot oil.\n3. Deep fry till golden brown, turning only once. Use slotted spoon to transfer fish to a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle lightly with salt immediately! \n\nOnion Rings 2 cups all purpose flour, divided2 teaspoons paprika1 teaspoon garlic powder2 teaspoons salt1/2 teaspoon pepper12 ounces of your favorite beer 2 large Vidalia onionsVegetable or Peanut oil for frying \n\n* In a large bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of flour with the paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Whisk in the beer until the mixture is well combined. Let the batter rest at room temperature for 10-12 minutes.\n* While the batter rests, cut the tip off of the stem side of the onions then remove peel. Slice the onions horizontally into 1/2 inch thick rings and toss them with the remaining 1/2 cup of flour.\n* Add the oil to a large, Dutch oven to a depth of 2 inches and heat it over medium high heat until a deep fry thermometer reaches 375\u00b0F.\n* Working in batches, dip onion rings into prepared batter shaking off excess, then immediately drop into hot oil. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Allow the onions to cook in the oil, flipping them once to guarantee even browning, for a total of approximately 3 minutes. Remove onions with slotted spoon and transfer them to paper towel lined plate. Immediately season with salt. Repeat coating & frying process, returning the oil to 375 between batches, with remaining onions!  \n\nHomemade Tartar Sauce \n* Worcestershire sauce Mayonnaise \n* Fresh squeezed lemon juice\n* Garlic smashed to taste \n* chopped dill baby dill pickles \n* fresh or dried dill weed\u00a0\n* pepper\n* Mix all ingredients together.  It\u2019s best if chilled overnight and can meld together.

{"title": "Not photogenic, but crazy flavours and healthier than any takeaway", "selftext": "Hi all. I made this huge dinner tonight because I was hungry and wanted some egg fried rice and beef. \n\nI made 500g of beef with some tomato puree and spices (garlic cayenne pepper tons of salt/pepper and some cumin, kept it simple) \nFried it up in my trusty cast iron with some butter got it lovely and coloured. Juicy af. Drained the juices back into the skillet and got it a bit hotter, melted in some beef tallow and a bit of butter and stuck in some rice and cayenne peppers, fried them babies until it was sizzling and smelling crazy, added some tomato puree and got it all stirred in, finished frying her up and stuck it on top of the beef.  \n\nThen I scrambled a goose egg in the same skillet, didn\u2019t wash just straight in to get them flavours kicking. Got the goose egg scrambled up with some butter and beef tallow to get it crispy, added in some more rice and salt, a bit of chilli and tons of pepper. Got it all fried up and yellow and added more butter to get it golden and coloured and to stop it sticking. Tasted brilliant. \n\nThe vague ingredients go something like this\n600g beef mince \n50-75g beef tallow\n200g salted butter\nSalt (idk how much I used, but I use a lot of it, maybe ten tablespoons?)\nPepper (same amount as salt? Idk really but just cover them babies in pepper and cayenne chilli)\nCayenne pepper ^\nCumin (maybe a tablespoon for the beef, same for the rice)\nTomato puree (idk again, maybe two tablespoons on the beef, one on the rice)\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go heavy on the fat, butter, salt and maters, it\u2019s all flavour and all good for ya. \n\nSo yeah, that was my dinner. I\u2019m super full from the rice but feeling good and happy, much healthier than a takeaway, no seed oils, soy, chemicals or non stick, full of nutrition for building muscle and test \ud83d\udc4d", "url": "https://i.redd.it/qbqhygfisvse1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1743799939.0, "score": 28, "author": "Successful_Panda_169", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/dinner/comments/1jrmdo4/not_photogenic_but_crazy_flavours_and_healthier/", "html_title": ""}

You can make the patties a day ahead if you like and put them in the fridge on parchment paper.  Use whatever mushrooms you prefer.  I like to use the yellow potatoes in my mash.  \n\nSalisbury Steaks: \n1 large egg\n1/2 cup breadcrumbs\n1 tablespoon ketchup\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 pound lean ground chuck (I used 93% lean)\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\nYour Mushrooms: \n2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 pound sliced mushrooms\n4 garlic cloves crushed \nYour Gravy: \n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n3 tablespoons all purpose flour\n2.5 cups low sodium beef broth\n1 tablespoon steak sauce\n1 tablespoon tomato paste \n\u00a0\nTo make the steak patties combine the egg, breadcrumbs, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper and stir together until well combined. Add the ground chuck and mix until well combined. Use your hands to form into four patties.\nDrizzle a large saut\u00e9 pan with olive oil and bring the pan to medium heat. Lay the patties in the pan in a single layer and cook for 3-5 minutes until the bottom is golden. Flip and cook for another 3-5 minutes until beef steaks are cooked through. Remove to a side plate and cover.\nTo make the mushrooms, add olive oil to the saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add sliced mushrooms and stir to toss in oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-6 minutes until the mushrooms are softened and gold around edges. Add crushed garlic. Stir and cook for another 60 seconds. Remove to the side plate with meat patties and cover to keep warm.\nTo make the gravy, add butter to saut\u00e9 pan and melt over low heat.  Add flour and whisk to combine: it will make sort of a paste \u2013 don\u2019t worry about anything stuck to the bottom of the pan from what was already in it.  It will come up when you add your liquid. Add in the broth a little bit at a time stirring to combine as you go so that the flour dissolves into the broth and you scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the Beef broth, steak sauce and tomato paste and whisk into the sauce. Raise the heat to bring the sauce to a boil, stirring regularly, and then reduce the heat to low to simmer. Simmer uncovered for a minute until the gravy thickens a bit.\nTo finish the dish, add the mushrooms and steak patties back into the pan, along with any juices on the plate. Spoon some gravy over the top of the steaks and mix the mushrooms into the sauce. Cover the pan partially with a lid set slightly askew, and leave the burner on low for five minutes until warmed through, stirring occasionally. Garnish with parsley. \nOven Roasted Carrots\nOne pound of fresh carrots cut lengthways. \nExtra-virgin olive oil - this helps carrots soften and brown in the oven\nHoney is a trick that my Nana taught me growing up cooking with her.  It lightly glazes the carrots and highlights the sweetness. \nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper. \nPlace the carrots in a large bowl. Toss them with the honey, olive oil, salt, and pepper, mixing well to  coat them.\nSpread in a single layer on a sheet pan at 425 and roast for 40-50 minutes turning as needed. Check often so honey doesn\u2019t burn.  Garnish with fresh parsley! \n\nI serve with homemade mashed potatoes and the yummy gravy!  \n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y7ewiceb21re1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742992074.0, "score": 61, "author": "KarinsDogs", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/dinner/comments/1jkak5k/salisbury_steak_w_mushroom_gravy_honey_glazed/", "html_title": ""}
