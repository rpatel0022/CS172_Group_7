Maple Pecan Bundt Cakes\n\nCake (Well, Muffin In Silicone Bundt Cake Mold) Recipe (I sprinkled the topping inside the mold and then poured the batter on top): https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/morning-maple-muffins/\nIcing Recipe: https://www.whattheforkfoodblog.com/2023/11/08/easy-maple-glaze-recipe-for-baked-goods-maple-icing/\n\n2. Brioche Dinner Rolls (Bear Shape)\n\nRecipe: https://simplyhomecooked.com/brioche-dinner-rolls/\nInstructions: https://sugaryums.com/teddy-bear-buns/#recipe\n\n3. Brioche Dinner Rolls (Pumpkin Shape)\n\nRecipe: https://simplyhomecooked.com/brioche-dinner-rolls/\nInstructions (I used an almond for the stem): https://www.itsalwaysautumn.com/pumpkin-shaped-dinner-rolls.html\n\n4. Lemon Loaf with Lemon Icing and Lemon Zest\n\nCake Recipe (I baked it in a Pullman Pan for that square shape, my fav pan to use): https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/iced-lemon-pound-cake/#tasty-recipes-69597\nIcing Recipe (I used Lemon juice and Lemon Extract, then sprinkled lemon zest on top of the wet icing for aesthetics and extra flavor): https://www.marthastewart.com/313152/lemon-glaze\n\n5. Hexagon Iced Sugar Cookies:\n\nCookie Recipe: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sugar-cookies-recipe-1914697\nIcing Recipe (I used Almond Extract): https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11587/sugar-cookie-icing/\n\n6. Maple Pecan Muffins\n\nRecipe (I made twice the amount of topping bc its really good): https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/morning-maple-muffins/\n\n7. Iced lemon Bundt Cake with Lemon Glaze\n\nCake Recipe: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/iced-lemon-pound-cake/#tasty-recipes-69597\nGlaze Recipe: https://www.marthastewart.com/313152/lemon-glaze\n\nI worked 12 hours every single day last week except for Tuesday and Wednesday, where I only worked at my morming job 6 hours. So I knew what I had to do to make this work. \n\nI used all of Tuesday and Wednesday night to bake all of these, and packaged them all up using cellophane bags and a heat sealer, and cute lil' ribbons, and brought them all into work the next morning at 7 AM! The reaction was very happy and fun :3 It made everyone smile\n\nI made sure that I packaged a bag up for my night job, so I could take some for them as well.  :3 Those went fast also. \n\nBaking feels like wizardry, it feels like conjuring up something from nothing. And it is. It's magical. A pile of flour and salt and creativity and passion turns into a cute little teddy bear roll, or a lemon cake slice. \n\nAnyways, thanks for letting me share. I love baking and i like being in this subreddit to share my bakes. \n\nBonus at the end: last night I baked a Cinnamon Swirl Brioche and it came out so nice. Tastes amazing toasted with butter! \n\nBonus Recipe:\n\nCinnamon Swirl Brioche:\n\nhttps://handletheheat.com/cinnamon-swirl-bread/#wprm-recipe-container-34344", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gzny3n", "created_utc": 1732554639.0, "score": 6237, "author": "Faux_Mango", "num_comments": 263, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1gzny3n/i_baked_7_different_desserts_in_14_hours_for_an/", "html_title": ""}

That way, I could pipe the bodice of the dress directly onto the Barbie and not have to worry about building some kind of frosting dress at human scale.

He loved the cookies I baked.  He asked if I ever baked gingersnaps.  I said I have baked them, but not for these social events as I don\u2019t think they have a wide enough appeal.  He met the social committee\u2019s chairperson at the Meet & Greet and volunteered to hold IT help nights.  So as a surprise I brought him a batch of Gingersnaps to his first IT help night.  A couple months later I sent him a panicked email (I think it was Easter) to say my cookbook file was corrupted.  Saying I was panicked is understating things.  He emailed me back and arranged to come to the house.  I asked him how much he charged per hour.  He said he charged a batch of gingersnaps.  He not only recovered my cookbook but he also taught me the proper way to format paragraphs.  I basically typed up my Word documents as if I was typing on a typewriter.  I was so grateful I made him a bonus batch of lemon sugar cookies.\n\nSo it is a year later.  He no longer lives in the community as he moved in with his now fianc\u00e9e.  I emailed him that I wanted to hire him to see if my old printer could be connected to my new laptop.  An Hp rep said no.  But of course their goal is for me to buy a new printer.  I also wanted him to remove the hard drives from my two laptops- one running Windows 10 and the one from 2011 (that was shoved in a closet) that ran Windows 7.  It was time to retire them.  Permanently.  \n\nNot only did he get the printer to work with the new laptop, but he got it to print wirelessly.  I never managed to get the wireless printing to work.

The filling is stabilized whipped cream with powdered freeze dried strawberries added. It needed a bit more tartness so I ate it with some raspberry coulis I had on hand.

{"title": "Shokupan/Japanese milk bread", "selftext": "Second batch in 3 days\nThis recipes a winner (not my own, it's from what to cook today website)\n\nOnly deviation I did is coat the top in butter when hot out of the oven as I prefer the crust with\n\n\n\nRecipe copied from their print recipe page\n\n\nEquipment\nKitchen Aid Standmixer\nsmall loaf pan\nIngredients\nRoux starter (Tangzhong): prepare one day before for the best result\n15 g bread flour (12.7% protein content)\n90 g whole milk\nDry ingredients:\n300 g bread flour (12.7% protein content)\n4 g SAF Gold instant yeast or instant yeast, see notes\n15 g milk powder\nWet ingredients:\n80 g whole milk plus more as needed\n55 g egg lightly beaten, 1 large egg\nIngredient to add last to the dough:\n40 g unsalted butter softened\n4 g salt\n30 g sugar see notes\nEgg wash:\n1 egg beaten\nToppings (optional):\nSesame seeds for sprinkling (optional)\nAlmond Thinly sliced\nInstructions\nI use this Pullman loaf pan that measures 8.3x 4.8 x 4.5 inch on the exterior and the interior measures 7.5 x 4x 4.4 inch. It's a tall loaf pan. You can also a standard regular 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.75 inch loaf pan\nTo adjust the recipe to different pan size, please see my post below\nPrepare tang zhong:\nPlace milk and the bread flour in a small saucepan. Whisk until there is no more lumps. Cook this mixture over low-medium heat until it reaches 65 C (149 F). Remove from the heat and cover with a plastic wrap, touching the tangzhong so the skin won't form. You can use it on the same day once it has cool down, but I highly suggest using this the next day. It improves the taste of the bread. Store this in the fridge\nMake the dough:\nIf you use active dry yeast, mix the yeast with 2 tablespoons of warm milk you are going to use in the recipe to bloom the yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it is foamy and bubbly.\nMix all the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the wet ingredients and the tang zhong you made earlier. Use a dough hook attachment to knead the dough on speed 2 until all the crumbly dough starts to come together into one mass, it may take about 2-3 minutes for this to happen. Don't be tempted to add any liquid. You may need to stop halfway and scrape the dough off the hook and the sides of the bowl and knead again several times \nOnce it comes into a rough dough, stop the machine. The dough will not be smooth, don't worry. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 minutes. This is an important rest that bakers refer to as an autolyse (though in our case it's a short one. Read my post above for detail)\nAfter the rest, turn on and knead the dough again on speed 2 and knead for 1-2 minutes until it is a bit smoother. Then add the salt and sugar into the dough. Continue to knead until the dough is relatively smooth. You need to stop and scrape the dough off the hook and the bowl several times during this process. I promise it's worth the effort!\nOnce you have a smooth dough, turn the machine back on again to knead and increase speed to 4. Gradually add in the softened butter a bit by a bit.  The dough will turn into a REAL sticky mess again because of the butter, just keep kneading and stop halfway and scrape the dough off the hook and bowl again and continue to knead until the butter is absorbed by the dough. IT WILL HAPPEN, don't worry! DO NOT be tempted to add any extra flour. You will get a shiny smooth dough that is very elastic. This may take about 10-15 minutes. The dough must pass a windowpane test, meaning, when you stretch a small amount of dough thinly, it won't break and a light can pass through\n1st proofing:\nPlace this dough in a lightly oiled large bowl, cover it with a clean and damp tea cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise at a warm place for about 1 hour until the dough doubles in volume\nTo bake the next day:\nIf you don't plan to bake on the same day, deflate the dough and then round it up into a dough ball and keep in an air-tight container and put it in the coldest part of your fridge (not freezer) for up to 12 hours. I don't recommend any longer than that. Proceed to shaping\nShaping:\nLightly oil your loaf pan all over. You can also use a non-stick spray. If the dough is cold from the fridge, let it sit at room temperature for about 15-20 minutes and the proceed to shaping\nDeflate the dough and separate it into 3 equal-weight dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten\nRoll each ball out into a rectangle shape (don't have to be exact). Fold the two long sides up and then roll it from the bottom to top. Place the seam side down in the loaf pan and repeat with the other 2 doughs. Place them next to each other. Cover with a plastic wrap\n2nd proofing:\nLet the dough proof again for another 45 minutes to one hour (or longer depending on the temperature and the yeast you use) or until they fill up the loaf pan, about 90%. Brush the top of the dough with egg wash\nSprinkle with some white sesame seeds or other seeds of your choice if you like\n15 minutes before the end of proofing, preheat oven to 375 F (190 C) for conventional oven. If you use a convection oven, lower the temperature by 20 F or 15 C.\nBaking:\nPut the pan on the middle rack and let it bake for the next 25-30 minutes depending on the oven, mine took about 25 minutes. The internal temperature on the center of the bread is at least 190 F (88 C). I highly recommend a digital thermometer to take out the guess work!\nRemove from the oven and remove the bread from the pan and cool down completely on the cooling rack. Enjoy and once it's cooled down completely, wrap it up with plastic wrap and it's good for about 3 days or so at room temperature (it didn't last that long in our house)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdw0qv", "created_utc": 1746287284.0, "score": 76, "author": "DweebiD", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kdw0qv/shokupanjapanese_milk_bread/", "html_title": ""}

The original is 350F for 30 minutes.\n\nThe icing ended up pretty sweet, would simply adding less icing sugar still result in a good buttercream frosting?\n\nThanks all", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1kczsh2/help_with_converting_round_cake_to_rectangular/", "created_utc": 1746189097.0, "score": 7, "author": "Vorkah", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kczsh2/help_with_converting_round_cake_to_rectangular/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Help with substitutions (multiple)", "selftext": "I'm a somewhat beginner baker\u2014I'm pretty good at baking with recipes and even improvising a bit, but I don't really understand the *why* behind a lot of it\u2014and so I have a lot of questions about substitutions, and searching online confuses me more because I end up getting seven different answers, so I thought I'd compile my questions, and that way I could get specific answers.\n\n1) I don't have (or want to buy, because nobody in my house is going to use it) espresso powder, but I really want to make coffee-flavoured things, or add a coffee note to chocolate cakes, brownies etc. I have dark roasted ground coffee with chicory. I don't think I can just directly replace the espresso powder with ground coffee since it doesn't dissolve. In cake recipes where there's water or milk, I've tried to replace varying amounts of the liquid with brewed coffee or coffee with milk, but I can never taste it when it's done, even when I can definitely smell it in the batter. \n\na) Can I just replace espresso powder with coffee powder? \n\ni) If so, then in what ratio? \n\nii) If not, then what else can I do?\n\nb) What about when there's liquid\u2014how much of it should I replace, and how strong should the coffee be?\n\n2) I really like the taste of brown sugar, but substituting it 1:1 (which is the advice I generally saw online) changes the texture of the cake. I really like the texture of \"Depression Cake\", and I've made it vanilla-flavoured before by just substituting the cocoa powder for more flour, but when I replaced even just half of the sugar with brown sugar (dark brown, it's the only variety I have), it became really dense and not spongy at all. For cookies and cakes using the creaming method it worked perfectly, but not for this. How can I do it for cakes like this?\n\n3) Butter: how can I replace it with oil in cake recipes, because generally I've found that ones with oil are much more moist, which is definitely how I like my cakes. For recipes using melted butter I've just directly replaced it with oil 1:1, but I'm not sure about how to do it for creaming/reverse creaming method recipes. If I can't replace it, any tips on how to make them more moist?\n\n4) Butter again: I generally use salted butter and just don't add additional salt and it's perfectly fine, but when it involves brown butter, it becomes wayyy too salty. I bought unsalted butter, but when I melted it, it smelt so bad. The only way I can describe it is the smell of when you're cooking ghee at home (iykyk). Any replacements? Or any tips on how to make it not smell?\n\n5) Cinnamon: this one isn't about substitution, but more of how much to use. I don't have cinnamon powder, I grate cinnamon sticks instead. I've followed the amount specified in recipes, and sometimes I can't taste or smell it at all, while other times it's way too overpowering. Is there any sort of general thumb rule for how much cinnamon to add?\n\n6) Corn syrup, molasses: Can I replace them with maple syrup? Honey? Sugar?\n\n7) Cream cheese and sour cream: Obviously if I'm making cream cheese frosting I'll get cream cheese, but for cake batter, can I replace cream cheese and/or sour cream with yoghurt? If not, then any other replacements?\n\n  \nThank you all tremendously in advance and sorry for the long ass post haha.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1kcdqgg/help_with_substitutions_multiple/", "created_utc": 1746118723.0, "score": 1, "author": "Old_Condition9030", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kcdqgg/help_with_substitutions_multiple/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Once cooled and gelled, beat until it becomes like whipped cream. \n\nRecipe used stand mixer, but I used my Thermomix TM6 to beat it bc I don't have a whisk attachment for my stand mixer (it broke), also most professional kitchens I've worked in use Thermomixes (is that even the right plural?) for most of their creams, sauces, etc and I wanted to try it as a restaurant level cream for dessert. Anyway, the cream, instead of fluffying up like whipped cream broke instead and I'd like to know why and how to avoid it next time.\n\nI tried saving it but I made it worse, I tried slowly pouring cold cream while beating at very low speed, but the cream became runnier, and then I found an article saying to add a bit of corn syrup (used glucose but I believe they're interchangeable?) but it didn't do anything. Maybe another way to save it? I was pretty confident in using my Thermomix because I've made whipped cream with it before (with butterfly attachment, which I also used for this cream) and it was even better than with a stand mixer, so why didn't this work?\n\nEdit: the recipe said to add the glucose while heating the cream, but I forgot it and added it alongside the chocolate and gelatin, is glucose required to heat first before it can \"work\"? Also, the recipe called for sheets of gelatin, but I only had powder which I added in the same amount called for, I may have gone 0.5-1 gram more than the recipe.\n\nThanks a lot for your time!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1kc65m5/monte\u00e9_split/", "created_utc": 1746098072.0, "score": 2, "author": "MasterDeePrime", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kc65m5/monte\u00e9_split/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The flavour has to be not boring. With a lot of cakes with just buttercream and blonde cake I find myself not liking them that much because they just taste sweet and kinda bland. Don't like chocolate cake either because it has too much of just one flavour which is bland to me. My favourites are pumpkin pie and sweet potato pie but I don't live in the US where puree and pie dough comes premade and I don't have time for that.\u00a0\n\n\n\n2. It's made in a communal kitchen, so nothing too messy. We also don't have a blender. It can't take too long because other people wanna use the kitchen too. But I've got some lovely friends who would probably help me which would lower the amount of time it'd take for just one person.\n\n\n\n3. I love strawberries!

(i know its not absolutely needed but as a beginner definitely wouldve helped!)\n\napril 2023 (plain white ones): i decided to give it another shot, this time french method but with the recipe from sallys baking addiction. still had no piping tip but this time the tops were at least smoother and had some doming but everything else was inconsistent. some had no feet, some were cracked. \n\nmarch 2024 (animal cracker looking ones): i gave it a long break because it was demoralizing lol. this time still used french method but used sugar spun runs recipe. still no piping tip. similar results to my first time but tops were too shiny and still were flat with no dome. \n\nmarch 2024 (yellow ones): gave it a shot 6 days later, same recipe but i bought a proper tip and baking sheets! lol these looked the best  and were the most consistent all around at the time, however pretty flat and still no dome. \n\napril 2025 (orange ones): i impulsively decided to come back at it trying the swiss method using broma bakery's recipe (i watched pies and tacos video but for some reason did not use her recipe). as you can see it was a disaster. nothing was salvagable. honestly the egg whites started cooking over my double boiler too but somehow i was still able to make a meringue lol. this was the worst. i had to come back a week later because of how disappointed i was. \n\napril 2025 (white ones with chocolate inside): i went back to french method and used the recipe and tips from indulge with mimi after someone who successfully makes macarons suggested it. this is a good recipe because it is for a much lower amount so you can troubleshoot without wasting too many ingredients. i had 5 of my most successful ones with the tray with the \"leftover\" batter that i didnt wanna waste. they are not perfect but they were beautiful to me! nice dome, smooth tops, nice feet, not hollow. unfortunately the main tray was a disaster. they came out looking decent but after letting it sit and trying to remove them from the sheet, 90% of the tops were hollow and separating. since the first tray with 5 seemed darker i lowered the temp for the other tray which probably was a bad idea. i would guess i didnt leave it in long enough either. however, it is my belief that since 5 of them came out beautifully, the batter wasnt poorly mixed, but i am piping way too much for one macaron. i was able to make 5 sandwiches at least. \n\nim not giving up! ... not yet at least haha. but i will probably give it another long break before i try again. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kboact", "created_utc": 1746039241.0, "score": 15, "author": "tmgnad", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kboact/my_macaron_journey/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

No frills, no gimmicks, just exactly what you'd want and expect out of an oatmeal cookie.\n\n\n**Chocolate chip and Butterscotch chip - [Kroll's Corner](https://krollskorner.com/recipes/desserts/cookies/chewy-oatmeal-chocolate-chip-cookies/)**\n\n\nPersonally I'm not quite sold on chocolate in oatmeal cookies, like, I'd just rather reach for a chocolate chip cookie at that point?  That said, this is still a great cookie.\n\n\n**Pecan brittle - [Claire Saffitz](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gGBC4-CsXOM)**\n\n\n\nA top tier cookie that misses its mark as an oatmeal cookie (maybe in part due to grinding up half the oats?).  For me, this was more a cookie that happened to have oats in it.  If I make this again, I'll probably save myself some time and stop at the brittle, because why bother?\n\n\n\n**Banana - [Life Love and Sugar](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/moist-chewy-banana-oatmeal-cookies/)**\n\n\n\nWet.  Very wet.  Most certainly user error on my part with adding more banana than indicated (honestly, I was just desperate to clear out the dangerously ~~brown~~ black bananas in my fruit bowl).  Had to bake straight from the freezer.  Still, so. Good.  Like banana bread, but better, obviously, because it's a cookie.\n\n\n\n**ANZAC biscuits - [RecipeTin Eats](https://www.recipetineats.com/anzac-biscuits-golden-oatmeal-cookies/)**\n\n\nIn an effort to remain faithful to the recipe, I did swing by a specialty food store for golden syrup.  (I'm sorry, pantry, my beloved).  As I say this, I will also cop to the following alterations: addition of salt and vanilla, because it's a cookie, these need to be there.  Also, I browned the butter because if you're going to have me melt butter, I'm always going to just take the extra few minutes to brown it.\n\n\nThat said, these cookies spread like crazy (feature or a bug, who knows?), I don't think I've ever abused #thecookiescoot so flagrantly.  Anyway, they tasted awesome.  Crunchy and chewy at the same time, somehow? with lovely notes of caramel-toffee-toasty-sugary goodness.  It's always a little weird baking something you've never had before, since there's no basis for comparison, but I'm going to go ahead and call these a rousing success.\n\n\n**No-bake cookie butter - [Sugar Spun Run](https://sugarspunrun.com/cookie-butter-no-bake-cookies/)**\n\n\nEasily the stand-out for me out of all the cookies in this batch.  Simple and quick, the effort to pay-off ratio for this cookie is beyond absurd.  Then again, cookie butter tends to be a bit of a cheat code.  If you have it on hand, you likely have all the other ingredients in the pantry, go make them, it literally takes 10 minutes. \n\n\n\n\nHappy baking!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbg24t", "created_utc": 1746018504.0, "score": 26, "author": "running462024", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kbg24t/the_lineup_for_oatmeal_cookie_day_today_430/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Chef thrown into teaching a baking class\u2026", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nFirst off, just want to say that I do not identify as a baker, but have been a professional chef my whole adult life, and bake basically as a hobby. I understand the concepts and think I'm pretty good at executing the basics. I teach culinary classes at my local community college and this semester I had to take over the Professional Baking class when the previous teacher backed out last minute. I'm a few classes away from the end of the semester and am struggling to figure out what to do in these last couple days.\n\nThe first classes of the semester I focused on straight, foaming, cut-in and creaming method, with each day having multiple recipes that represent each technique. I usually have three teams of three students each day and will give each team their own recipe/example of the chosen topic. I did choux with them last week and had them all do eclairs and gougeres, and will be moving on to meringues next week. I was hoping to have each team make a different version of meringue (Swiss, Italian, French) and then bake them all off/make pavlovas, to compare how they bake up. But i'm reading that French Meringue is the only meringue that bakes up well, so I don't know if my original idea is still viable...?\n\nMy next thought was to have each team do a different meringue and then go straight into meringue buttercreams, but French is the outlier there considering French Buttercream doesn't use French Meringue.\n\nDoes anyone see a way to make this cobbled together idea for a lesson make sense? I have 5 hours each day in class with them, and usually try to fill it with at least a two stage recipe (cake and filling for example), but I am totally drawing a blank on how to make this meringue lesson work and have the entire 5 hours be filled.\n\nThanks a ton", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1kaef0e/chef_thrown_into_teaching_a_baking_class/", "created_utc": 1745897139.0, "score": 0, "author": "HeinousHollandaise", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kaef0e/chef_thrown_into_teaching_a_baking_class/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

While the chicken is cooking, roll out your puff pastry and cut it into two rounds, one for the bottom and one for the top.\n\n# Step 2: Assemble the Dish\n\n* Place the first puff pastry round on a baking tray. Arrange the fried chicken drumsticks in a star pattern, with the thick end in the center and the bones pointing outward. Sprinkle grated cheese in the center of the drumsticks. Then, place the second puff pastry round on top. Press the edges of the pastry well to seal them around the chicken.\n\n# Step 3: Brush, Sprinkle & Bake\n\n* Once the edges of the pastry are sealed, brush the top layer with a beaten egg to give it a golden, shiny finish. Sprinkle sesame seeds evenly over the top for added crunch and flavor.\n* Place the assembled pastry in a preheated oven at 190-200\u00b0C (375-400\u00b0F). Bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy, and the chicken is cooked through.\n\n# Ready to Serve\n\n* So, it\u2019s ready to enjoy! These Puff Pastry Wrapped Chicken Drumsticks are perfect for impressing guests or making a simple meal feel extra special. They\u2019re great for family dinners or casual gatherings, and they\u2019re sure to be a hit!\n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ka1j04", "created_utc": 1745861870.0, "score": 1, "author": "Angels_Kitchen", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1ka1j04/i_made_baked_chicken_drumsticks/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Tip for tiering odd-shaped cakes", "selftext": "I made a friend\u2019s wedding cake today, and she wanted two heart-shaped tiers. I opted to buy a set of heart-shaped pans, and wasn\u2019t sure how to get the layers even - you can\u2019t just look up the volume of heart-shaped pans, because there are so many different heart shapes!\n\nI knew I needed to make two layers of each tier. The big heart pan was a little bigger than a regular 8- or 9-inch round, and the small one was smaller than those rounds, so I knew I would be able to use one batch of cake batter for one big + one small layer. But I wasn\u2019t sure how to divvy up the batter so that the layers would all be even.\n\nEventually I figured out a method, and it worked GREAT. I put each pan on my kitchen scale and tared it to zero. I then filled each pan with an inch of water (measured with a ruler), and wrote down the weight of the water in grams. I added up the weight of the water in the big pan & in the small pan, and then turned those into percentages:\n\n823g    -> 73%\n302g    -> 27%\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n1125g (100%)\n\nThen I made a batch of cake batter and weighed it, subtracting the weight of my mixing bowl. It was 1383g. So 73% of my cake batter was 1009g, so I put almost that amount in the big pan, and the rest in the small pan (I knew that some would stay in the bowl no matter how much I scraped, and adjusted accordingly).\n\nI did the same thing with the second batch of batter, for the second layers, and I was delighted to see that all my layers turned out the same height! (Obviously I did still have domes to slice off, but that\u2019s to be expected.)\n\nThere are probably other ways to accomplish this, but this was the easiest way that occurred to me - and it didn\u2019t involve trying to find the area of a heart shape, because that is WAY more math than I want to do. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway - I thought I would put this here in case it ever helps anyone else!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/gmb0p5gv49xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745704878.0, "score": 26, "author": "annsy5", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1k8oems/tip_for_tiering_oddshaped_cakes/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Orange Date Loaf Cake w/ Pistachios and Saffron Icing", "selftext": "Second Pic is pre-Icing. \n\nFor the cake:\n\n1 1/2 cup soy milk or alternative milk\n\n18-20 dates, pitted\n\n1/2 cup vegan butter/oil (if you use salted butter, omit salt)\n\n1 tsp vanilla extract \n\n1/2 tsp cardamom\n\n1/2 tsp cinnamon \n\n1/4 tsp allspice \n\n1/4 tsp clove\n\n1/8 tsp salt (if using unsalted butter/oil)\n\n1 Orange\n\n1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour\n\n2 tsp baking powder \n\n1/2 cup pistachios \n\nPreheat the oven to 350F/180C\n\nZest and peel the orange. Blend segments (minus seeds) into juice. Set aside. \n\nPit dates, if not already pitted, and add them to a saucepan. Add soy milk, or alternative. And set on low heat, stirring occasionally, until dates soften and milk begins to change colour. \n\nBlend dates and milk together into thick sauce. I used an immersion blender and did all mixing in one pan, but you may pour it into a blender capable of handling hot ingredients, or wait for them to cool before blending them.\n\nAdd butter/oil and blend until smooth. \n\nAdd vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon, allspice, clove, and salt (if needed). Mix to combine. \n\nAdd 2/3 of orange zest to mixture and all orange juice and mix to combine. \n\nSift in flour and baking powder. Mix until all flour is incorporated and smooth. \n\nChop pistachios roughly into desired size chunks, or give them a quick blitz in a food processor, or put them in a bag and give them a piece of your mind until you achieve optimal bits. \n\nAdd most of the pistachio pieces to the batter and mix them in, reserving about 2 tablespoons.\n\nAdd parchment paper to loaf pan or cake pan. Pour batter into pan and tap to remove bubbles. Sprinkle with 1/2 of remaining pistachio pieces. \n\nBake in oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.\n\nWhile the cake is baking, begin preparing the icing. \n\nFor the icing:\n\n8-12 threads of saffron\n\n1/2 cup boiling water\n\n1/2 cup powdered sugar.\n\nRemaining orange zest\n\nAdd saffron to a heat safe liquid measuring cup. Add boiling water. Stir to agitate on occasion as it cools. You will want to remove the threads later, so don't crush them. \n\nClean up your mess in the kitchen while you wait for the cake to finish baking, so you don't forget it's in the oven.\n\nWhen cake is out of the oven, allow it to cool before finishing the icing. Removing it from the pan and placing it onto a metal rack will facilitate faster cooling. \n\nTo finish the icing, add powdered sugar to a bowl, mix in remaining orange zest.\n\nEither strain out or pull out threads of saffron from liquid gold. \n\nAdd liquid gold to confectioners' sugar until desired consistency is reached. \n\nPour, spoon, or drizzle icing to heart's content, on top of loaf cake, either in or not in a pan, you decide.\n\nTop with remaining pistachio pieces. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nThis recipe definitely makes more icing than you \"need,\" but I would rather not have too little icing, myself, so this reflects that. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8sv6p", "created_utc": 1745718496.0, "score": 8, "author": "Souboshi", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1k8sv6p/orange_date_loaf_cake_w_pistachios_and_saffron/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

At first, it whipped up like a dream. Following her guide, it came together nicely. I make regular Swiss meringue buttercream all the time so I was very familiar with the methods here.\n\nI was able to crumb coat my cake no problem.

No problem, I\u2019m used to Swiss meringue being temperamental with temperatures and needing to heat/cool and re whip to get it perfectly smooth again. Although with the cream cheese recipe, I fear there was no coming back. The more I whipped the frosting, the more curdled it became. I tried cooling it back down, then heating it back up to room temp, but no luck. Measuring the buttercream at 72 degrees F, it was still getting that liquidy layer and not coming together like traditional Swiss meringue buttercream does. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if more time sitting around allowed for more water from the cream cheese to seep out.

{"title": "Why does my chocolate chip cookie dough look more like frosting than dough?", "selftext": "(This picture was taken after about 30 minutes of chilling and admittedly it does look a little more firm). \n\nExactly as the title says. I am using a recipe that creams the butter and sugar first. However, I used half of my butter that the recipe calls for to make brown butter. I got the creamed mixture looking pretty fluffy and definitely full of air after I added the (slightly cooled) brown butter. So at that point with all of my butter and sugars combined I thought it was good for a creamed mixture and I proceeded with all my dry ingredients which I folded in. However despite the flour and whatnot, the dough looks more like batter or honestly frosting with how airy it is, instead of a typical chocolate chip cookie dough. I guess I must have overcreamed my butter and sugar?? I should add I am new to creaming so I was basing it off google images. Everytime I have tried doing it before, it never looked like this so I was initially proud of how airy I got it, but now I am worried I ruined the texture of my cookies. I should also add I have made this recipe before but without browning the butter (and likely not proper creaming) and the dough came together as a traditional cookie dough.\n\nChatgpt says it'll be ok after chilling it (which I was already planning to do for at least 2 hours), but I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what they did? If the chilling does not help the dough, should I try adding flour to the chilled dough, do I let it get to room temp before adding the flour, do I do nothing at all because the fridge will fix it? Also, how will the cookies turn out with a texture like that? I assume they will be quite cakey which is not how I typically enjoy my chocolate chip cookies (team chewy all the way) but I don\u2019t discriminate cuz a cookie is a cookie. I still think they will taste great though, I am just a little sad/worried about the texture.\n\nThanks :,)", "url": "https://i.redd.it/75v2x2kj30xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745595468.0, "score": 4, "author": "uhh-i-dont-know", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1k7nztj/why_does_my_chocolate_chip_cookie_dough_look_more/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I baked a batch of ginger snaps and lemon sugar cookies.  They were the payment for my computer guy.  He was here two hours.", "selftext": "I met him a year ago when he was walking his dog.  He was new to the community so I invited him to the social committee\u2019s next Meet & Greet.  He loved the cookies I baked.  He asked if I ever baked gingersnaps.  I said I have baked them, but not for these social events as I don\u2019t think they have a wide enough appeal.  He met the social committee\u2019s chairperson at the Meet & Greet and volunteered to hold IT help nights.  So as a surprise I brought him a batch of Gingersnaps to his first IT help night.  A couple months later I sent him a panicked email (I think it was Easter) to say my cookbook file was corrupted.  Saying I was panicked is understating things.  He emailed me back and arranged to come to the house.  I asked him how much he charged per hour.  He said he charged a batch of gingersnaps.  He not only recovered my cookbook but he also taught me the proper way to format paragraphs.  I basically typed up my Word documents as if I was typing on a typewriter.  I was so grateful I made him a bonus batch of lemon sugar cookies.\n\nSo it is a year later.  He no longer lives in the community as he moved in with his now fianc\u00e9e.  I emailed him that I wanted to hire him to see if my old printer could be connected to my new laptop.  An Hp rep said no.  But of course their goal is for me to buy a new printer.  I also wanted him to remove the hard drives from my two laptops- one running Windows 10 and the one from 2011 (that was shoved in a closet) that ran Windows 7.  It was time to retire them.  Permanently.  \n\nNot only did he get the printer to work with the new laptop, but he got it to print wirelessly.  I never managed to get the wireless printing to work.  So two batches of cookies in exchange for two hours worth of computer work was the barter system at its finest. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdy8nd", "created_utc": 1746293176.0, "score": 277, "author": "CatfromLongIsland", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kdy8nd/i_baked_a_batch_of_ginger_snaps_and_lemon_sugar/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

It's a tall loaf pan. You can also a standard regular 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.75 inch loaf pan\nTo adjust the recipe to different pan size, please see my post below\nPrepare tang zhong:\nPlace milk and the bread flour in a small saucepan. Whisk until there is no more lumps. Cook this mixture over low-medium heat until it reaches 65 C (149 F). Remove from the heat and cover with a plastic wrap, touching the tangzhong so the skin won't form. You can use it on the same day once it has cool down, but I highly suggest using this the next day. It improves the taste of the bread. Store this in the fridge\nMake the dough:\nIf you use active dry yeast, mix the yeast with 2 tablespoons of warm milk you are going to use in the recipe to bloom the yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it is foamy and bubbly.\nMix all the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the wet ingredients and the tang zhong you made earlier. Use a dough hook attachment to knead the dough on speed 2 until all the crumbly dough starts to come together into one mass, it may take about 2-3 minutes for this to happen. Don't be tempted to add any liquid. You may need to stop halfway and scrape the dough off the hook and the sides of the bowl and knead again several times \nOnce it comes into a rough dough, stop the machine. The dough will not be smooth, don't worry. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 minutes. This is an important rest that bakers refer to as an autolyse (though in our case it's a short one. Read my post above for detail)\nAfter the rest, turn on and knead the dough again on speed 2 and knead for 1-2 minutes until it is a bit smoother. Then add the salt and sugar into the dough. Continue to knead until the dough is relatively smooth. You need to stop and scrape the dough off the hook and the bowl several times during this process. I promise it's worth the effort!\nOnce you have a smooth dough, turn the machine back on again to knead and increase speed to 4. Gradually add in the softened butter a bit by a bit.  The dough will turn into a REAL sticky mess again because of the butter, just keep kneading and stop halfway and scrape the dough off the hook and bowl again and continue to knead until the butter is absorbed by the dough. IT WILL HAPPEN, don't worry! DO NOT be tempted to add any extra flour. You will get a shiny smooth dough that is very elastic. This may take about 10-15 minutes. The dough must pass a windowpane test, meaning, when you stretch a small amount of dough thinly, it won't break and a light can pass through\n1st proofing:\nPlace this dough in a lightly oiled large bowl, cover it with a clean and damp tea cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise at a warm place for about 1 hour until the dough doubles in volume\nTo bake the next day:\nIf you don't plan to bake on the same day, deflate the dough and then round it up into a dough ball and keep in an air-tight container and put it in the coldest part of your fridge (not freezer) for up to 12 hours. I don't recommend any longer than that. Proceed to shaping\nShaping:\nLightly oil your loaf pan all over. You can also use a non-stick spray. If the dough is cold from the fridge, let it sit at room temperature for about 15-20 minutes and the proceed to shaping\nDeflate the dough and separate it into 3 equal-weight dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten\nRoll each ball out into a rectangle shape (don't have to be exact). Fold the two long sides up and then roll it from the bottom to top. Place the seam side down in the loaf pan and repeat with the other 2 doughs. Place them next to each other. Cover with a plastic wrap\n2nd proofing:\nLet the dough proof again for another 45 minutes to one hour (or longer depending on the temperature and the yeast you use) or until they fill up the loaf pan, about 90%. Brush the top of the dough with egg wash\nSprinkle with some white sesame seeds or other seeds of your choice if you like\n15 minutes before the end of proofing, preheat oven to 375 F (190 C) for conventional oven. If you use a convection oven, lower the temperature by 20 F or 15 C.\nBaking:\nPut the pan on the middle rack and let it bake for the next 25-30 minutes depending on the oven, mine took about 25 minutes. The internal temperature on the center of the bread is at least 190 F (88 C). I highly recommend a digital thermometer to take out the guess work!\nRemove from the oven and remove the bread from the pan and cool down completely on the cooling rack. Enjoy and once it's cooled down completely, wrap it up with plastic wrap and it's good for about 3 days or so at room temperature (it didn't last that long in our house)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdw0qv", "created_utc": 1746287284.0, "score": 79, "author": "DweebiD", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kdw0qv/shokupanjapanese_milk_bread/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Help with substitutions (multiple)", "selftext": "I'm a somewhat beginner baker\u2014I'm pretty good at baking with recipes and even improvising a bit, but I don't really understand the *why* behind a lot of it\u2014and so I have a lot of questions about substitutions, and searching online confuses me more because I end up getting seven different answers, so I thought I'd compile my questions, and that way I could get specific answers.\n\n1) I don't have (or want to buy, because nobody in my house is going to use it) espresso powder, but I really want to make coffee-flavoured things, or add a coffee note to chocolate cakes, brownies etc. I have dark roasted ground coffee with chicory. I don't think I can just directly replace the espresso powder with ground coffee since it doesn't dissolve. In cake recipes where there's water or milk, I've tried to replace varying amounts of the liquid with brewed coffee or coffee with milk, but I can never taste it when it's done, even when I can definitely smell it in the batter. \n\na) Can I just replace espresso powder with coffee powder? \n\ni) If so, then in what ratio? \n\nii) If not, then what else can I do?\n\nb) What about when there's liquid\u2014how much of it should I replace, and how strong should the coffee be?\n\n2) I really like the taste of brown sugar, but substituting it 1:1 (which is the advice I generally saw online) changes the texture of the cake. I really like the texture of \"Depression Cake\", and I've made it vanilla-flavoured before by just substituting the cocoa powder for more flour, but when I replaced even just half of the sugar with brown sugar (dark brown, it's the only variety I have), it became really dense and not spongy at all. For cookies and cakes using the creaming method it worked perfectly, but not for this. How can I do it for cakes like this?\n\n3) Butter: how can I replace it with oil in cake recipes, because generally I've found that ones with oil are much more moist, which is definitely how I like my cakes. For recipes using melted butter I've just directly replaced it with oil 1:1, but I'm not sure about how to do it for creaming/reverse creaming method recipes. If I can't replace it, any tips on how to make them more moist?\n\n4) Butter again: I generally use salted butter and just don't add additional salt and it's perfectly fine, but when it involves brown butter, it becomes wayyy too salty. I bought unsalted butter, but when I melted it, it smelt so bad. The only way I can describe it is the smell of when you're cooking ghee at home (iykyk). Any replacements? Or any tips on how to make it not smell?\n\n5) Cinnamon: this one isn't about substitution, but more of how much to use. I don't have cinnamon powder, I grate cinnamon sticks instead. I've followed the amount specified in recipes, and sometimes I can't taste or smell it at all, while other times it's way too overpowering. Is there any sort of general thumb rule for how much cinnamon to add?\n\n6) Corn syrup, molasses: Can I replace them with maple syrup? Honey? Sugar?\n\n7) Cream cheese and sour cream: Obviously if I'm making cream cheese frosting I'll get cream cheese, but for cake batter, can I replace cream cheese and/or sour cream with yoghurt? If not, then any other replacements?\n\n  \nThank you all tremendously in advance and sorry for the long ass post haha.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1kcdqgg/help_with_substitutions_multiple/", "created_utc": 1746118723.0, "score": 1, "author": "Old_Condition9030", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kcdqgg/help_with_substitutions_multiple/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Monte\u00e9 split", "selftext": "So I wanted to make a white chocolate monte\u00e9; recipe was as follows:\n\nHeat about half the cream with glucose syrup (with aromatics of choice) when brought to boil, take off heat, add the white chocolate and bloomed gelatin, leave for a couple seconds, then whisk until melted and smooth. Add remaining cream that is cold to lower the temperature, then refrigerate until it thickens (4-5 hours, according to recipe, I left it overnight). Once cooled and gelled, beat until it becomes like whipped cream. \n\nRecipe used stand mixer, but I used my Thermomix TM6 to beat it bc I don't have a whisk attachment for my stand mixer (it broke), also most professional kitchens I've worked in use Thermomixes (is that even the right plural?) for most of their creams, sauces, etc and I wanted to try it as a restaurant level cream for dessert. Anyway, the cream, instead of fluffying up like whipped cream broke instead and I'd like to know why and how to avoid it next time.\n\nI tried saving it but I made it worse, I tried slowly pouring cold cream while beating at very low speed, but the cream became runnier, and then I found an article saying to add a bit of corn syrup (used glucose but I believe they're interchangeable?) but it didn't do anything. Maybe another way to save it? I was pretty confident in using my Thermomix because I've made whipped cream with it before (with butterfly attachment, which I also used for this cream) and it was even better than with a stand mixer, so why didn't this work?\n\nEdit: the recipe said to add the glucose while heating the cream, but I forgot it and added it alongside the chocolate and gelatin, is glucose required to heat first before it can \"work\"?

(i know its not absolutely needed but as a beginner definitely wouldve helped!)\n\napril 2023 (plain white ones): i decided to give it another shot, this time french method but with the recipe from sallys baking addiction. still had no piping tip but this time the tops were at least smoother and had some doming but everything else was inconsistent. some had no feet, some were cracked. \n\nmarch 2024 (animal cracker looking ones): i gave it a long break because it was demoralizing lol. this time still used french method but used sugar spun runs recipe. still no piping tip. similar results to my first time but tops were too shiny and still were flat with no dome. \n\nmarch 2024 (yellow ones): gave it a shot 6 days later, same recipe but i bought a proper tip and baking sheets! lol these looked the best  and were the most consistent all around at the time, however pretty flat and still no dome. \n\napril 2025 (orange ones): i impulsively decided to come back at it trying the swiss method using broma bakery's recipe (i watched pies and tacos video but for some reason did not use her recipe). as you can see it was a disaster. nothing was salvagable. honestly the egg whites started cooking over my double boiler too but somehow i was still able to make a meringue lol. this was the worst. i had to come back a week later because of how disappointed i was. \n\napril 2025 (white ones with chocolate inside): i went back to french method and used the recipe and tips from indulge with mimi after someone who successfully makes macarons suggested it. this is a good recipe because it is for a much lower amount so you can troubleshoot without wasting too many ingredients. i had 5 of my most successful ones with the tray with the \"leftover\" batter that i didnt wanna waste. they are not perfect but they were beautiful to me! nice dome, smooth tops, nice feet, not hollow. unfortunately the main tray was a disaster. they came out looking decent but after letting it sit and trying to remove them from the sheet, 90% of the tops were hollow and separating. since the first tray with 5 seemed darker i lowered the temp for the other tray which probably was a bad idea. i would guess i didnt leave it in long enough either. however, it is my belief that since 5 of them came out beautifully, the batter wasnt poorly mixed, but i am piping way too much for one macaron. i was able to make 5 sandwiches at least. \n\nim not giving up! ... not yet at least haha. but i will probably give it another long break before i try again. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kboact", "created_utc": 1746039241.0, "score": 17, "author": "tmgnad", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kboact/my_macaron_journey/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

(I'm sorry, pantry, my beloved).  As I say this, I will also cop to the following alterations: addition of salt and vanilla, because it's a cookie, these need to be there.  Also, I browned the butter because if you're going to have me melt butter, I'm always going to just take the extra few minutes to brown it.\n\n\nThat said, these cookies spread like crazy (feature or a bug, who knows?), I don't think I've ever abused #thecookiescoot so flagrantly.  Anyway, they tasted awesome.  Crunchy and chewy at the same time, somehow? with lovely notes of caramel-toffee-toasty-sugary goodness.

Even just letting them cool down hardens them a fair bit, and by evening they are just tough to chew, and not really that nice in general.\n\nThe recipe I use varies (especially the fat I use varies) but the issue appears in all of them. I use universal flour 500g, water/milk, yeast 30g, sugar (to start up the yeast), salt, and either olive oil, animal fat 50-100g, or butter 50-100g (or sometimes a combination). T. I let the dough rise for an hour, then cut into pieces, shape it and let it rise again before washing it with some egg and sesame/sunflower/flax seeds.

I understand the concepts and think I'm pretty good at executing the basics. I teach culinary classes at my local community college and this semester I had to take over the Professional Baking class when the previous teacher backed out last minute. I'm a few classes away from the end of the semester and am struggling to figure out what to do in these last couple days.\n\nThe first classes of the semester I focused on straight, foaming, cut-in and creaming method, with each day having multiple recipes that represent each technique. I usually have three teams of three students each day and will give each team their own recipe/example of the chosen topic. I did choux with them last week and had them all do eclairs and gougeres, and will be moving on to meringues next week. I was hoping to have each team make a different version of meringue (Swiss, Italian, French) and then bake them all off/make pavlovas, to compare how they bake up. But i'm reading that French Meringue is the only meringue that bakes up well, so I don't know if my original idea is still viable...?\n\nMy next thought was to have each team do a different meringue and then go straight into meringue buttercreams, but French is the outlier there considering French Buttercream doesn't use French Meringue.\n\nDoes anyone see a way to make this cobbled together idea for a lesson make sense? I have 5 hours each day in class with them, and usually try to fill it with at least a two stage recipe (cake and filling for example), but I am totally drawing a blank on how to make this meringue lesson work and have the entire 5 hours be filled.\n\nThanks a ton", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1kaef0e/chef_thrown_into_teaching_a_baking_class/", "created_utc": 1745897139.0, "score": 0, "author": "HeinousHollandaise", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1kaef0e/chef_thrown_into_teaching_a_baking_class/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

While the chicken is cooking, roll out your puff pastry and cut it into two rounds, one for the bottom and one for the top.\n\n# Step 2: Assemble the Dish\n\n* Place the first puff pastry round on a baking tray. Arrange the fried chicken drumsticks in a star pattern, with the thick end in the center and the bones pointing outward. Sprinkle grated cheese in the center of the drumsticks. Then, place the second puff pastry round on top. Press the edges of the pastry well to seal them around the chicken.\n\n# Step 3: Brush, Sprinkle & Bake\n\n* Once the edges of the pastry are sealed, brush the top layer with a beaten egg to give it a golden, shiny finish. Sprinkle sesame seeds evenly over the top for added crunch and flavor.\n* Place the assembled pastry in a preheated oven at 190-200\u00b0C (375-400\u00b0F). Bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy, and the chicken is cooked through.\n\n# Ready to Serve\n\n* So, it\u2019s ready to enjoy!

Working with gelatin feels intimidating, I have had a couple failures so far. This was also my first time making a sponge cake. The cake did not turn out as risen and fluffy as I\u2019d hoped. I had followed a recipe I found online (I will post in the comments) and did not realize that I had to beat egg whites until they were a significantly different texture - I combined thoroughly and then ended up with a very runny cake mix. After it came out of the oven and collapsed, I watched a few videos of step-by-step sponge cake and realized I was missing a crucial step - oh well - next time I guess!\n\nI still used the cake and the final result was edible and rather tasty.

Also egg wash. Theres no boiling the dough before baking.\n\nVariation 1 uses greek yogurt, bread flour, and your standard baking soda and powder. You also set the dough in the fridge for 25 minutes before boiling dough (4-5 cups water, 1-2tbsp baking soda) and then applying egg wash and then baking.\n\nVariation 2 is the same as variation 1, but with 1/2 all purpose flour, 1/2 bread flour.\n\nAnyway, this is what I found:\nThe OG was good, a little doughy but it tasted like a solid sourdough bagel. I liked it. It didn\u2019t have as much volume as I would have liked, but that\u2019s probably due to not boiling and setting dough. \n\nVariation 1 was most like the taste of your traditional plain bagel, and had a nice density to it. However I wish it would have had a tiny bit more rise.\n\nVariation 2 was my favorite, and it had that sourdough flavor but also the traditional slight nuttiness of a normal bagel. I found it had a good balance of density and rise, maybe a little fluffier than a normal bagel though, but I like the sourdough flavor so I probably won\u2019t change the recipe at all.\n( here\u2019s the recipe)\n\nhttps://www.recipebox.com/recipe/cd9a2fd0/greek-yogurt-bagel-recipe-2?editId=67f521ff94c1bb6927db71e8\n\n\nHonestly 10/10 in my opinion for healthier easy bagels.

Could too much cocoa powder add too much fat and therefore the spreading?\n\nThe only things I can think of is that I doubled the recipe (I'm confident I had the correct amounts of everything) and I used farm eggs so they were not official \"large\" eggs -- so I might have been a little heavy on the egg white or whole eggs -- the eggs were a *little* big.\n\nBut... the dough was described as \"somewhere between a batter and a dough\" and what I have most DEFINITELY a heavy dough -- so it's not a problem of having too much liquid.\n\nSomeone on another forum suggested the type of butter I used but I used Trader Joe's organic unsalted butter, like I always do. And it's never caused a problem before that I recall. And again, the dough was not at all batter-like \u2013 it was VERY thick dough, which would have made me think the results would be the opposite of what I got.   \n\nIdeas?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1k99kr1/help_cookies_that_came_out_much_too_thin_and/", "created_utc": 1745775328.0, "score": 1, "author": "banet14", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1k99kr1/help_cookies_that_came_out_much_too_thin_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

You will want to remove the threads later, so don't crush them. \n\nClean up your mess in the kitchen while you wait for the cake to finish baking, so you don't forget it's in the oven.\n\nWhen cake is out of the oven, allow it to cool before finishing the icing. Removing it from the pan and placing it onto a metal rack will facilitate faster cooling. \n\nTo finish the icing, add powdered sugar to a bowl, mix in remaining orange zest.\n\nEither strain out or pull out threads of saffron from liquid gold. \n\nAdd liquid gold to confectioners' sugar until desired consistency is reached. \n\nPour, spoon, or drizzle icing to heart's content, on top of loaf cake, either in or not in a pan, you decide.\n\nTop with remaining pistachio pieces. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nThis recipe definitely makes more icing than you \"need,\" but I would rather not have too little icing, myself, so this reflects that. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8sv6p", "created_utc": 1745718496.0, "score": 8, "author": "Souboshi", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1k8sv6p/orange_date_loaf_cake_w_pistachios_and_saffron/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Tip for tiering odd-shaped cakes", "selftext": "I made a friend\u2019s wedding cake today, and she wanted two heart-shaped tiers. I opted to buy a set of heart-shaped pans, and wasn\u2019t sure how to get the layers even - you can\u2019t just look up the volume of heart-shaped pans, because there are so many different heart shapes!\n\nI knew I needed to make two layers of each tier. The big heart pan was a little bigger than a regular 8- or 9-inch round, and the small one was smaller than those rounds, so I knew I would be able to use one batch of cake batter for one big + one small layer. But I wasn\u2019t sure how to divvy up the batter so that the layers would all be even.\n\nEventually I figured out a method, and it worked GREAT. I put each pan on my kitchen scale and tared it to zero. I then filled each pan with an inch of water (measured with a ruler), and wrote down the weight of the water in grams. I added up the weight of the water in the big pan & in the small pan, and then turned those into percentages:\n\n823g    -> 73%\n302g    -> 27%\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n1125g (100%)\n\nThen I made a batch of cake batter and weighed it, subtracting the weight of my mixing bowl. It was 1383g. So 73% of my cake batter was 1009g, so I put almost that amount in the big pan, and the rest in the small pan (I knew that some would stay in the bowl no matter how much I scraped, and adjusted accordingly).\n\nI did the same thing with the second batch of batter, for the second layers, and I was delighted to see that all my layers turned out the same height! (Obviously I did still have domes to slice off, but that\u2019s to be expected.)\n\nThere are probably other ways to accomplish this, but this was the easiest way that occurred to me - and it didn\u2019t involve trying to find the area of a heart shape, because that is WAY more math than I want to do. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway - I thought I would put this here in case it ever helps anyone else!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/gmb0p5gv49xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745704878.0, "score": 25, "author": "annsy5", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1k8oems/tip_for_tiering_oddshaped_cakes/", "html_title": ""}

At first, it whipped up like a dream. Following her guide, it came together nicely. I make regular Swiss meringue buttercream all the time so I was very familiar with the methods here.\n\nI was able to crumb coat my cake no problem. But I had to let the crumb coat chill for a few hours before starting to frost the rest of the cake.

No problem, I\u2019m used to Swiss meringue being temperamental with temperatures and needing to heat/cool and re whip to get it perfectly smooth again. Although with the cream cheese recipe, I fear there was no coming back. The more I whipped the frosting, the more curdled it became. I tried cooling it back down, then heating it back up to room temp, but no luck. Measuring the buttercream at 72 degrees F, it was still getting that liquidy layer and not coming together like traditional Swiss meringue buttercream does. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if more time sitting around allowed for more water from the cream cheese to seep out. (As shown in the video, I purchased cream cheese with zero stabilizers, and got 2.5oz of water out of the cream cheese before working it into the butter). Sigh. I\u2019m so disappointed.

{"title": "Why does my chocolate chip cookie dough look more like frosting than dough?", "selftext": "(This picture was taken after about 30 minutes of chilling and admittedly it does look a little more firm). \n\nExactly as the title says. I am using a recipe that creams the butter and sugar first. However, I used half of my butter that the recipe calls for to make brown butter. I got the creamed mixture looking pretty fluffy and definitely full of air after I added the (slightly cooled) brown butter. So at that point with all of my butter and sugars combined I thought it was good for a creamed mixture and I proceeded with all my dry ingredients which I folded in. However despite the flour and whatnot, the dough looks more like batter or honestly frosting with how airy it is, instead of a typical chocolate chip cookie dough. I guess I must have overcreamed my butter and sugar?? I should add I am new to creaming so I was basing it off google images. Everytime I have tried doing it before, it never looked like this so I was initially proud of how airy I got it, but now I am worried I ruined the texture of my cookies. I should also add I have made this recipe before but without browning the butter (and likely not proper creaming) and the dough came together as a traditional cookie dough.\n\nChatgpt says it'll be ok after chilling it (which I was already planning to do for at least 2 hours), but I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what they did? If the chilling does not help the dough, should I try adding flour to the chilled dough, do I let it get to room temp before adding the flour, do I do nothing at all because the fridge will fix it? Also, how will the cookies turn out with a texture like that? I assume they will be quite cakey which is not how I typically enjoy my chocolate chip cookies (team chewy all the way) but I don\u2019t discriminate cuz a cookie is a cookie. I still think they will taste great though, I am just a little sad/worried about the texture.\n\nThanks :,)", "url": "https://i.redd.it/75v2x2kj30xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745595468.0, "score": 3, "author": "uhh-i-dont-know", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/Baking/comments/1k7nztj/why_does_my_chocolate_chip_cookie_dough_look_more/", "html_title": ""}
