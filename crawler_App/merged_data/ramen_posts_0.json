{"title": "Some Ramen bowls from my recent trip to Tokyo", "selftext": "Pic 1: Ramen Matsui located in Shinjuku. Small shop run by a husband and wife. Michelin guide ramen. They source ingredients from all over Japan, including duck. This bowl was elite. \n\nPic 2: Kagaribi located in Ginza. This is a one man operation. He makes his own noodles, which are wavy and bouncy. Amazing bowl. \n\nPic 3: Manriki located in Seishincho. This place goes heavy on the spices, and the entire restaurant is adorned with the Buddhist manji. The broth was very flavorful. They have a location in Akihabara as well.\n\nPic 4: Komuro located near Gyotoku station. They make their noodles in-house. Classic Chashu-Wontonmen bowl. \n\nPic 5: Okachimachi Menya Musashi Bukotsu located in Ueno. All the other heavy hitter ramen shops had 1+ hour lines. I was only third in line for this shop but that is the beauty of Japan, you can get great ramen at most shops just a few steps away. I got the Niboshi bowl here, but they are known for their Tsukemen, which includes a squidink or spicy broth. \n\nPic 6: Aoba located in Nakano. They are the first shop to combine Tonkotsu broth and seafood broth into a single bowl, a technique which is now commonly used at many other shops. \n\nPic 7: Setagaya Ramen located inside Haneda Airport.  Even if it was airport ramen, it tasted great and was clearly better than some well-known shops I\u2019ve been to in Los Angeles. \n\nI used the Ramen Beast app to find all these shops. If you ever plan a trip to Tokyo, I recommend this app, since it highlights almost all of the notable shops that are within your geographic area. Keep in mind that it doesn\u2019t have every shop listed, as only locations that Ramen Beast has actually eaten at are listed, so there are many other shops you can still find on your own.

My wife hasn't ever been able to try tonkotsu ramen because pork makes her sick, so I opened up Ramen Lord's Book of Ramen and zeroed in on a chicken alternative. \n\nI followed all of the directions for the tori paitan ramen, with the only exceptions being using koikuchi in place of white soy sauce, using rolled and tied, skin-on, boneless chicken thighs in place of pork belly for the chashu, and a baking soda trick with angel hair pasta that I found... somewhere... \n\nIt's really good! It coats the mouth the way I'd expect from a paitan broth, the chicken scallion oil is great, and the couple of tablespoons of tare I threw in this is just enough seasoning. I definitely didn't heat the bowls enough because it lost a lot of heat fast, but I'll correct that next time. I want to learn how to make noodles, but we have already begun outgrowing the one bedroom apartment we're currently in and the last thing we need right now is more kitchen gadgets.  \n\nOverall, I'm really happy with it and I'm excited to try more styles of ramen as time goes on.

{"title": "Oni or \"Devil Level\" Ramen from Kikanbo!", "selftext": "100/10 bowl of ramen. It gets my seal of approval. Pork was succulent and tender with great flavor, the egg had the perfect consistency, and the spiciness was phenomenal. Noodles had great tooth to it and the right thickness. It's almost like they had two layers to them and they probably have the correct cooking time down to the second. Couldn't ask for a better bowl. \n\nComing in, I was expecting the ramen to be the spiciest thing ever because of stories I heard on the internet and thought it would be something straight out of Man vs. Food.\n\nI ordered the Oni or \"Devil Level\" with a bit of the numbing pepper. Wanted to experience the full, fiery inferno of the dish (or so I thought). The broth was spicy but not unbearably spicy to the point where I would be writhing in agony. I took a small sip, waited for the spiciness to kick in and it never did. Took another sip... still nothing. Then went ahead and ate like normal. Great depth, spicy, and I could still taste the amazing flavors of the soup. Low key, I wish it was spicier. \n\nBe right back, going to make a reminder to throw all my instant ramen packs in the trash when I get back to the states. \n\nPro Tip: If you want to tackle this challenge, but afraid of the spice messing up your digestive system, eat 1 or 2 bananas about 10 minutes beforehand.

{"title": "Ramen from my last trip to Japan (Feb. 2025)", "selftext": "In Fukuoka :\n\nHakata Ikkousha\n\nNice but not my favourite. Very similar to Ichiran. I'm not a fan of thin noodles and the flavor was a little weak for my taste.\n\n\n\nRamen Stadium (in Canal City)\n\nYou can choose from 8 different ramen restaurants, all located in the same place.\n\nSapporo Misono : the highlight here is the meat, which was thin strips of marinated prok belly. Aside from that, forgettable.\n\nTonkotsu Tsukemen Ondo : was advertised as the one with the thickest noodles and the fattiest/thickest broth. Good but no wow factor for me.\n\n\n\nIn Hiroshima :\n\nTsukemen Honpo Karabu : never had this style of tsukemen before, you're supposed to mix the noodles with some toppings (negi, nori, katsuoboshi), then dip them in a flavorful and spicy oil. You can choose the spiciness level from 1 to 30. I picked 15 but found it a little undewhelming. Still, very tasty and original experience.\n\n\n\nOsaka\n\nGaten Z : technically not ramen, it's a style called \"maze soba\". You get thick wheat noodles (same as the ones you would get in a Jiro style ramen), with all the toppings, a raw yolk, and a small amount of concentrated broth/sauce (making it a \"dry\" type of noodle dish). It was very tatsy, with a strong black pepper flavor.\n\n\n\nRamen Otoko Jyuku : this is Jiro style ramen and my favorite kind. Bold flavours, thick stock, thick noodles, fatty goodness. They ask you how much vegetables, fat and garlic you want. As you can see on the photo I picked the maximum amount of garlic (mashi mashi) and let's just say I will never do that again. It took me all afternoon to digest (just before riding the plane, smart move !). This wasn't my first time there (I normally don't ask for that much garlic) and if I could only pick one bowl of ramen, this would be the one.

If you come across it at an asian grocery, grab it and don't think twice. \n\nNoodles: [Sun Noodles Kaedama](https://sunnoodle.com/products/kaedama/). Wish I had time to make a fresh batch but didn't get the chance. Pulled them just short of the 2 minute cook time to retain some bite.\n\nAroma oil: Garlic & shallot finely diced and slow cooked in a mixture of canola & refined coconut oil. Smells incredible.\n\nToppings: Braised & torched tofu, roasted cherry tomatoes, scallions & sesame seeds. I tried boiling the carrots (substitute for menma) in mirin, sugar, sesame oil, and soy sauce instead of roasting them & marinating. This softened the texture but the flavor/sweetness was deeper, more intense.\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/lxraek5fq6ue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744369772.0, "score": 364, "author": "_reamen_", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/ramen/comments/1jwn8ia/feels_good_to_be_making_ramen_again/", "html_title": ""}

(If you make it don\u2019t mind sending me the pictures!!!) \n\nAn easy, quick ramen recipe:\n\nStart by making a simple tare by mixing soy sauce 182ml, instant dashi 100ml, mirin 10ml, brown sugar 10g, salt 7.5g, and a bit of cider vinegar 2.5g you can also add nuoc mam and add a very few grams (3G). Buy instant noodles, and fry some scallions in oil gently until they become golden. Use this oil as your aromatic oil, and the scallions as a topping. For the soup, get some instant or bottled chicken stock. Buy chicken breast or thighs season them and cook them with love (seared then simmer in soy sauce ginger sugar mirin sake), you can also just cook it the way you like, and use it as a topping. Boil an egg for exactly 6.5 minutes use it as topping.\n\nTo assemble, combine 36ml of tare, 16ml of scallion oil, 300ml of chicken stock, and top with scallions, eggs, and chicken.

But their main draw is the combination of both, a bowl of curry ramen which is a mix of both their curry and their ramen broth. Describing it as watered down curry, does not do it justice, since it gets a lot of the richness and the umami of the broth, but keeps the spice and complexity of the curry. Per default, you also get a clove of garlic freshly pressed into the bowl, which really amps up the punch of the bowl and should not be skipped, when you get asked if you\u2019re ok with some garlic in your bowl. Absolutely yes.\n\nRamen and Curry Taigen feels like a must visit if you are exploring the ramen scene of Yokohama and Kanagawa.

And when I went back to the store I bought the packet version expecting it to be the same thing. However, I feel like the bowl tasted better than the packet.. but I don't have any left to compare. Is this a real thing? The packets are cheaper, and I know they have less calories, but does it also not taste as good?

To make the bacon shoyu tare I need to make bacon dashi stock, is it recommended to add the leftover dashi to the chintan? if so how should I add it do I just combine it when I'm creating the stock or should I add it when I've strained the stock I've created.\n\n3. While I was able to get hold of some kombu, getting niboshi and katsuobushi is pretty difficult is there an alternative at all for their use? again I'm not looking for perfect and I've noticed there are powdered dashi stocks would it be possible to incoporate them when creating the tare and soup?

{"title": "Alterations to instant ramen that make it better in your opinion?", "selftext": "Whenever I make ramen, I tend to crush the noodles into something akin to rice (I\u2019m horrible, I know), before beginning to boil the water after adding some parsley, garlic powder, and onion (either in the form of powder, or chives) while I wait for the water to boil. When the water has boiled, I add the noodles, turn the heat down, add the seasoning, before lowering the heat again and adding more garlic/onion. \n\nThe result looks a little more refined than standard ramen, and it tends to have a much richer flavor. Obviously breaking the noodles into rice sized bits makes it look different, but if you just do the normal half/quarter based break you can end up with something that looks a few steps above normal instant ramen. In terms of flavor, I tend to find that the garlic/onion almost magnifies the general flavor of the ramen itself, and it makes it a little richer.

{"title": "Homemade Kitakata Ramen", "selftext": "Recipe based on Ramen_lord\u2019s recipe from a few years ago. \n\nDouble broth of chicken and dashi. Chicken backs and feet simmered for about 20 hours on low. For dashi, steeped niboshi and Kombu in water for six hours, brought up to 170 degrees, removed Kombu, brought it up to a bare simmer, turn off heat, add bonito, let steep for five minutes, strain. \n\nFor the tare, soak high quality soy sauce and sake with kombu for 24 hours. Bring to 170 degrees over medium low heat, remove kombu, add niboshi, season with salt, sugar, and msg. Once it\u2019s been barely simmering for about thirty minutes, turn off heat, add bonito, let steep for 5 minutes and strain. \n\nFor aromatic oil, I rendered chicken fat from the skin I tore off the chicken backs used to make the stock. Add niboshi heads, garlic, and scallion whites to chicken fat. Heat on low and let aromatics infuse for about thirty minutes. Strain. \n\nNoodles are just bread flour, salt, and baked baking soda. About 43% hydration. Recently I\u2019ve been making my ramen dough, and then letting it hydrate for about 24 hours before working with my hand crank Italian pasta maker. The dough is much easier to work with. I go about a 5 setting for thickness. \n\nTare and fat in the bowl, equal parts chicken and dashi added, noodles in, top w torched chashu, soft boiled egg, blanched bean sprouts, sliced scallions, garlic chive micro green, and a piece of nori. The bowl kind of looks like a smiley face. \n\nI was going for something very oceanic, but still light and clean. The bowl was rich, but not too heavy. Not incredibly fishy, but you could definitely taste the niboshi. Any thoughts or critiques welcomed!

{"title": "Ramen Adventures in Osaka & Fukuoka - Feb 2025", "selftext": "Just returned from a trip in Japan and managed to try four highly rated (on Tabelog) ramen shops in Osaka and one in Fukuoka. I solo dined at all of these.\n\nPictures appear in the order below:\n\n1) Moeyo Mensuke - Osaka\n\nMy favorite from this trip. Arrived at around 7pm on a weekday and had to queue for more than half an hour. Their special ramen was already sold out by the time I ordered, so I got the standard ramen with additional duck meat and pork bowl. This is duck ramen using a shoyu-base. Soup has a deep umami with slight sweetness. Not too heavy and very drinkable. Noodles are thin. I loved the duck meat which was cooked to medium and the semi-charred leeks. Pork bowl had a good charr, very satisfying. As a complete package, this had the most refined taste out of all the ramen I tried this trip. \n\n2) Kadoya Shokudo - Osaka \n\nThis is the highest rated shop in Osaka. Arrived right at opening time on a weekday and there was already a small line, but there was space at the counter for one diner so managed to skip the line. Ordered the signature tsukemen (upsized noodles) with recommended pork trotter topping and an egg. Cooking time was quite long and waited nearly 20 mins. This was a very satisfying bowl, I believe it is a shoyu-based dipping sauce but with a vinegary kick to it. Dipping sauce looks heavy but turn out to be quite light. Very easy to slurp with the noodles. Pork trotters (if that is your thing) were smooth and gelatinous. Price is quite steep - 3600 yen all in. Most expensive compared to all the other ramens I tried which were often around the 1500 yen range with add ons. \n\n3) Kirimen - Osaka\n\nA little far away from downtown Osaka. Arrived around 7pm on a weekday and queued for about 20 mins. I ordered the signature egg ramen, kaarage,  pork slices and egg toppings. Ramen comes with just a raw egg and you are supposed to mix well and add desired soy sauce and pepper to taste. Noodles were on the thicker side and paired well with the egg. Kaarage portions were generous (but not that crispy) and the pork and egg topping were ok. I regret not getting a rice bowl to not let the leftover egg sauce go to waste. While a satisfying bowl, I would stick with their tsukemen next time. Most patrons were eating it and it looked good. \n\n4) Chukasoba Kazura - Osaka\n\nSmall counter shop in a business area. I arrived at 1pm on a weekday and there was no queue. Had the shrimp and chicken paitan. Broth was super creamy and even foamy (no milk so I am not sure how they did it). Noodles are on thicker side. The broth was very interesting - it was like Singapore Laksa without the spicy heat. Felt like I was eating a fusion pasta due to how creamy the broth was. Also had the pork bowl that came with a pesto sauce, paired well with ramen. Delicious. \n\n5) Hakata Issou Main Store - Fukuoka \n\nSecond highest rated ramen shop in Fukuoka city at time of writing. Arrived about 15 mins before opening on a weekday and there was already a snaking queue outside the shop. Waited nearly 45 minutes to be seated. As you queue, you can smell the soup (which smells like wet socks lol). I ordered the signature ramen with all toppings. This is Hakata-style ramen (thin noodles, tonkotsu-based soup) and I will describe this as Ichiran on steroids. The broth was very porky, deeply umami and creamy. Pork was melt in your mouth. Super delicious and satisfying bowl. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ja3vn7", "created_utc": 1741839709.0, "score": 132, "author": "Single_Rutabaga_4776", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/ramen/comments/1ja3vn7/ramen_adventures_in_osaka_fukuoka_feb_2025/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Dinner Ramen party aftermath", "selftext": "Last night I hosted a double header Ramen showdown for friends.\n\nI made Ivan Orkins Shio Ramen\u2026 toasted rye noodles\u2026 soffrito and tomato and all! It was GLORIOUS!!!! I\u2019m not a huge fan of the guy but I was wowed by the noodles. The soffrito was fun to make and is deliciously unique and weird. I\u2019m not a crazy fan of tomato in general but my goodness that tomato worked! Overall a fun experience and tasty ramen, I\u2019ll take the katsoboshi salt onto other Ramens. It\u2019s odd that the noodles are the star\u2026. I think noodles serve a purpose and ramen and it says something when the noodles are the legit star of the show of this ramen dish. That\u2019s not just my opinion but those of my friends.\n\nI served 7 bowls of this ramen and then 7 bowls of my own Shoyu Ramen called the smoke show! \n\nSmoke show entails a take on the kezo shoyu ramen and ramen lords lighter shoyu Tare but I added smoked shoyu and some other modifications in measurements as well.\n\nI used the new wave Tokyo style noodles, an applewood smoked chashu pork belly, and an egg yolk confit in the smoked chashu sauce. I also added my secret Tare and brown sugar saut\u00e9ed Shiitake mushrooms that I absolutely ADORE!\n\nBoth were a crazy hit! And both use the same double broth. Chicken Chintan and Dashi. The dashi was an attempt at Ivan\u2019s but I had dried squid, niboshi, kombu, and 1 type of katsoboshi. \n\nIvan\u2019s ramen was the complete package and I think took the cake for the group but my own was a close second. This was the first time I had made either recipe and making 14 bowls of 2 ramens in my homes kitchen was a fun and intense experience.\n\nI didn\u2019t get many\u2026 almost any picture worthy from the night, but in the aftermath I made a mix.\n\n\nThe Dazed and Confuzed Ramen\u2026. Today with leftovers: my Smokey Tare, toasted rye noodles, katsoboshi salt, chicken fat, shredded scallions, jammy egg, double broth, Katsu, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and Parmesan crusted grilled corn!\n\nThe corn and cheese added some really nice sweetness and umami. The corn was grilled in butter and Togarashi before being cut from the cob and roasted in cheese and oil. \n\nAnyways, this was a fun weekend of Ramen and I learned a lot and experimented which is all Ramen ever should be.

{"title": "Seasoning the soup X using tare in the bowl", "selftext": "I saw a post here asking about this matter, and the comments were basically saying to use tare, without any explanation, which is quite sad. Here is my opinion about this matter. Please leave a comment if you agree/disagree with my points.\n\nRestaurants use tare instead of seasoning the broth in advance for three key reasons:\n\n1. Versatility \u2013 The same broth can be used for shio, shoyu, miso, etc by simply changing the tare. Not seasoning in advance gives flexibility.\n\n2. Preserving Aromas \u2013 During service, restaurant broths are kept boiling or almost boiling for quite long time. If soy sauce or miso is boiled too long, it loses some of its delicate aromas.\n\n3. Consistency \u2013 As the soup evaporates over time, pre-seasoning would concentrate the saltiness, making it harder to maintain a consistent flavor.\n\nAt home, those last 2 points are not that relevant. Unless I\u2019m making a large batch for a party, I don\u2019t find it necessary to follow the restaurant method of adding tare directly to the bowl. Instead, I prefer making and adding the tare into the pan while reheating the soup on the stove.\n\nRestaurants tested their recipes hundreds of times, and have test bowls every single day of service ensuring the exact tare amount provides a balanced bowl. However, at home, where I\u2019m making batch of 6\u20138 portions, I don\u2019t want to waste 2\u20133 portions just to adjust the tare. Adding tare while reheating allows me to fine-tune the taste before serving. If 20ml of tare isn\u2019t enough, I can add a bit more. If the broth is too salty, I can adjust with more broth, dashi, or water\u2014something much harder to do if the tare was already in the bowl.\n\nI would personally recommend that if you are at home, making small batches of ramen, to make a tare and season only the portion you\u2019re serving directly on the pan. If you\u2019ve made 10 portions of broth but only need 2 now, just reheat those 2 portions with the tare, taking care of not letting your soup to boil to avoid any loss in aroma, while tasting and adjusting the flavor. While the soup reheats, you can reheat the bowl, cook the noodles and put the aroma oil in the bowl.\n\nTakuro Yanase, ramen chef of Ramen Break Beats, follows this method\u2014he reheats the soup together with the tare. Although I can\u2019t say for certain if he does this to taste every bowl before serving or if he has other reasons.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/0uhsdwdsizke1.png", "created_utc": 1740358313.0, "score": 104, "author": "FreshBook8963", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ramen/comments/1iwpifo/seasoning_the_soup_x_using_tare_in_the_bowl/", "html_title": ""}

On the other hand making a double soup would let you optimize extraction for each dashi element but potentially thin the soup out too much, although this could be compensated for by making an intentionally overly thick stock. \n\nThat said, that all seems kinda theoretical.

Being completely honest, I did take other pictures, but my hand tremors were pretty bad that day, and most of my pictures are really shaky. Anyway, onto the review! \nFood 8/10. The ramen (I got the basic Tonkotsu bc there was no spicy miso at the time) was the star of the show, with a rich and oily broth that sits in your stomach like a warm hug. But the supporting cast was no slouch either, with the spicy tuna and crispy rice having a delightful hit of jalepeno, the gyoza having the perfect ratio of filling to wrapper, the salad being a refreshing reprieve from the more heavy items, and the curry being the best thing on the menu. If you\u2019re old enough to drink alcohol, I really enjoyed the yuzu margarita, which cut through the oiliness of the broth. \nService is where the score drops, with a 5/10. It was a Saturday night, and the location has only been open a couple of months at this point, so I\u2019m willing to give the benefit of the doubt and say it\u2019s probably not always this bad. But multiple things were missing/forgotten about by the kitchen staff, and stuff was generally chaotic. Our waiter was great, and explained everything perfectly. \nAs for ambiance, 7/10. It looks like every other \u2018hip and trendy\u2019 restaurant, with exposed brick, decor that is acceptably palatable, and low lighting. REALLY low lighting, to the point that I was struggling with reading the menu at points. Moving around the place was difficult, but I attribute that more to the place being packed to the gills. Still, be aware that it might not be the easiest place to move around if you\u2019re in a wheelchair or need to use a walker. \nOverall, I\u2019d give this place a 7.5/10, but I\u2019ll probably go back during spring break and test my theory that it would be much better on a weeknight.

I'm not a fan of thin noodles and the flavor was a little weak for my taste.\n\n\n\nRamen Stadium (in Canal City)\n\nYou can choose from 8 different ramen restaurants, all located in the same place.\n\nSapporo Misono : the highlight here is the meat, which was thin strips of marinated prok belly. Aside from that, forgettable.\n\nTonkotsu Tsukemen Ondo : was advertised as the one with the thickest noodles and the fattiest/thickest broth. Good but no wow factor for me.\n\n\n\nIn Hiroshima :\n\nTsukemen Honpo Karabu : never had this style of tsukemen before, you're supposed to mix the noodles with some toppings (negi, nori, katsuoboshi), then dip them in a flavorful and spicy oil. You can choose the spiciness level from 1 to 30. I picked 15 but found it a little undewhelming. Still, very tasty and original experience.\n\n\n\nOsaka\n\nGaten Z : technically not ramen, it's a style called \"maze soba\". You get thick wheat noodles (same as the ones you would get in a Jiro style ramen), with all the toppings, a raw yolk, and a small amount of concentrated broth/sauce (making it a \"dry\" type of noodle dish). It was very tatsy, with a strong black pepper flavor.\n\n\n\nRamen Otoko Jyuku : this is Jiro style ramen and my favorite kind. Bold flavours, thick stock, thick noodles, fatty goodness. They ask you how much vegetables, fat and garlic you want. As you can see on the photo I picked the maximum amount of garlic (mashi mashi) and let's just say I will never do that again. It took me all afternoon to digest (just before riding the plane, smart move !).

For the soup, get some instant or bottled chicken stock. Buy chicken breast or thighs season them and cook them with love (seared then simmer in soy sauce ginger sugar mirin sake), you can also just cook it the way you like, and use it as a topping. Boil an egg for exactly 6.5 minutes use it as topping.\n\nTo assemble, combine 36ml of tare, 16ml of scallion oil, 300ml of chicken stock, and top with scallions, eggs, and chicken.

But their main draw is the combination of both, a bowl of curry ramen which is a mix of both their curry and their ramen broth. Describing it as watered down curry, does not do it justice, since it gets a lot of the richness and the umami of the broth, but keeps the spice and complexity of the curry. Per default, you also get a clove of garlic freshly pressed into the bowl, which really amps up the punch of the bowl and should not be skipped, when you get asked if you\u2019re ok with some garlic in your bowl. Absolutely yes.\n\nRamen and Curry Taigen feels like a must visit if you are exploring the ramen scene of Yokohama and Kanagawa.

{"title": "Alterations to instant ramen that make it better in your opinion?", "selftext": "Whenever I make ramen, I tend to crush the noodles into something akin to rice (I\u2019m horrible, I know), before beginning to boil the water after adding some parsley, garlic powder, and onion (either in the form of powder, or chives) while I wait for the water to boil. When the water has boiled, I add the noodles, turn the heat down, add the seasoning, before lowering the heat again and adding more garlic/onion. \n\nThe result looks a little more refined than standard ramen, and it tends to have a much richer flavor. Obviously breaking the noodles into rice sized bits makes it look different, but if you just do the normal half/quarter based break you can end up with something that looks a few steps above normal instant ramen. In terms of flavor, I tend to find that the garlic/onion almost magnifies the general flavor of the ramen itself, and it makes it a little richer.

To make the bacon shoyu tare I need to make bacon dashi stock, is it recommended to add the leftover dashi to the chintan? if so how should I add it do I just combine it when I'm creating the stock or should I add it when I've strained the stock I've created.\n\n3. While I was able to get hold of some kombu, getting niboshi and katsuobushi is pretty difficult is there an alternative at all for their use? again I'm not looking for perfect and I've noticed there are powdered dashi stocks would it be possible to incoporate them when creating the tare and soup?

{"title": "Homemade Kitakata Ramen", "selftext": "Recipe based on Ramen_lord\u2019s recipe from a few years ago. \n\nDouble broth of chicken and dashi. Chicken backs and feet simmered for about 20 hours on low. For dashi, steeped niboshi and Kombu in water for six hours, brought up to 170 degrees, removed Kombu, brought it up to a bare simmer, turn off heat, add bonito, let steep for five minutes, strain. \n\nFor the tare, soak high quality soy sauce and sake with kombu for 24 hours. Bring to 170 degrees over medium low heat, remove kombu, add niboshi, season with salt, sugar, and msg. Once it\u2019s been barely simmering for about thirty minutes, turn off heat, add bonito, let steep for 5 minutes and strain. \n\nFor aromatic oil, I rendered chicken fat from the skin I tore off the chicken backs used to make the stock. Add niboshi heads, garlic, and scallion whites to chicken fat. Heat on low and let aromatics infuse for about thirty minutes. Strain. \n\nNoodles are just bread flour, salt, and baked baking soda. About 43% hydration. Recently I\u2019ve been making my ramen dough, and then letting it hydrate for about 24 hours before working with my hand crank Italian pasta maker. The dough is much easier to work with. I go about a 5 setting for thickness. \n\nTare and fat in the bowl, equal parts chicken and dashi added, noodles in, top w torched chashu, soft boiled egg, blanched bean sprouts, sliced scallions, garlic chive micro green, and a piece of nori. The bowl kind of looks like a smiley face. \n\nI was going for something very oceanic, but still light and clean. The bowl was rich, but not too heavy.

{"title": "Ramen Adventures in Osaka & Fukuoka - Feb 2025", "selftext": "Just returned from a trip in Japan and managed to try four highly rated (on Tabelog) ramen shops in Osaka and one in Fukuoka. I solo dined at all of these.\n\nPictures appear in the order below:\n\n1) Moeyo Mensuke - Osaka\n\nMy favorite from this trip. Arrived at around 7pm on a weekday and had to queue for more than half an hour. Their special ramen was already sold out by the time I ordered, so I got the standard ramen with additional duck meat and pork bowl. This is duck ramen using a shoyu-base. Soup has a deep umami with slight sweetness. Not too heavy and very drinkable. Noodles are thin. I loved the duck meat which was cooked to medium and the semi-charred leeks. Pork bowl had a good charr, very satisfying. As a complete package, this had the most refined taste out of all the ramen I tried this trip. \n\n2) Kadoya Shokudo - Osaka \n\nThis is the highest rated shop in Osaka. Arrived right at opening time on a weekday and there was already a small line, but there was space at the counter for one diner so managed to skip the line. Ordered the signature tsukemen (upsized noodles) with recommended pork trotter topping and an egg. Cooking time was quite long and waited nearly 20 mins. This was a very satisfying bowl, I believe it is a shoyu-based dipping sauce but with a vinegary kick to it. Dipping sauce looks heavy but turn out to be quite light. Very easy to slurp with the noodles. Pork trotters (if that is your thing) were smooth and gelatinous. Price is quite steep - 3600 yen all in. Most expensive compared to all the other ramens I tried which were often around the 1500 yen range with add ons. \n\n3) Kirimen - Osaka\n\nA little far away from downtown Osaka. Arrived around 7pm on a weekday and queued for about 20 mins. I ordered the signature egg ramen, kaarage,  pork slices and egg toppings. Ramen comes with just a raw egg and you are supposed to mix well and add desired soy sauce and pepper to taste. Noodles were on the thicker side and paired well with the egg. Kaarage portions were generous (but not that crispy) and the pork and egg topping were ok. I regret not getting a rice bowl to not let the leftover egg sauce go to waste. While a satisfying bowl, I would stick with their tsukemen next time. Most patrons were eating it and it looked good. \n\n4) Chukasoba Kazura - Osaka\n\nSmall counter shop in a business area. I arrived at 1pm on a weekday and there was no queue. Had the shrimp and chicken paitan. Broth was super creamy and even foamy (no milk so I am not sure how they did it). Noodles are on thicker side. The broth was very interesting - it was like Singapore Laksa without the spicy heat. Felt like I was eating a fusion pasta due to how creamy the broth was. Also had the pork bowl that came with a pesto sauce, paired well with ramen. Delicious. \n\n5) Hakata Issou Main Store - Fukuoka \n\nSecond highest rated ramen shop in Fukuoka city at time of writing. Arrived about 15 mins before opening on a weekday and there was already a snaking queue outside the shop. Waited nearly 45 minutes to be seated. As you queue, you can smell the soup (which smells like wet socks lol). I ordered the signature ramen with all toppings. This is Hakata-style ramen (thin noodles, tonkotsu-based soup) and I will describe this as Ichiran on steroids. The broth was very porky, deeply umami and creamy. Pork was melt in your mouth. Super delicious and satisfying bowl. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ja3vn7", "created_utc": 1741839709.0, "score": 134, "author": "Single_Rutabaga_4776", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/ramen/comments/1ja3vn7/ramen_adventures_in_osaka_fukuoka_feb_2025/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I\u2019m open to homemade or store bought options as different east Asian ingredients are fairly accessible for me. I\u2019ve already bought a really rich garlic paste meant for dishes like this and it tastes amazing so that\u2019s one thing. I\u2019m okay with spicy things. I\u2019m not very fond of mayu (black garlic oil) as I\u2019ve found it overwhelming. However, I\u2019m willing to give it another shot! If anybody had any ideas for what I can do to make it taste like something you\u2019d eat at a restaurant in your personal opinion, I\u2019d love to hear! I typically add green onion, a soy based \u201ctare\u201d, ajitsuke tamago egg and pork chashu, though the last two are still a work in progress. Thank you!

{"title": "Dinner Ramen party aftermath", "selftext": "Last night I hosted a double header Ramen showdown for friends.\n\nI made Ivan Orkins Shio Ramen\u2026 toasted rye noodles\u2026 soffrito and tomato and all! It was GLORIOUS!!!! I\u2019m not a huge fan of the guy but I was wowed by the noodles. The soffrito was fun to make and is deliciously unique and weird. I\u2019m not a crazy fan of tomato in general but my goodness that tomato worked! Overall a fun experience and tasty ramen, I\u2019ll take the katsoboshi salt onto other Ramens. It\u2019s odd that the noodles are the star\u2026. I think noodles serve a purpose and ramen and it says something when the noodles are the legit star of the show of this ramen dish. That\u2019s not just my opinion but those of my friends.\n\nI served 7 bowls of this ramen and then 7 bowls of my own Shoyu Ramen called the smoke show! \n\nSmoke show entails a take on the kezo shoyu ramen and ramen lords lighter shoyu Tare but I added smoked shoyu and some other modifications in measurements as well.\n\nI used the new wave Tokyo style noodles, an applewood smoked chashu pork belly, and an egg yolk confit in the smoked chashu sauce. I also added my secret Tare and brown sugar saut\u00e9ed Shiitake mushrooms that I absolutely ADORE!\n\nBoth were a crazy hit! And both use the same double broth. Chicken Chintan and Dashi. The dashi was an attempt at Ivan\u2019s but I had dried squid, niboshi, kombu, and 1 type of katsoboshi. \n\nIvan\u2019s ramen was the complete package and I think took the cake for the group but my own was a close second. This was the first time I had made either recipe and making 14 bowls of 2 ramens in my homes kitchen was a fun and intense experience.\n\nI didn\u2019t get many\u2026 almost any picture worthy from the night, but in the aftermath I made a mix.\n\n\nThe Dazed and Confuzed Ramen\u2026. Today with leftovers: my Smokey Tare, toasted rye noodles, katsoboshi salt, chicken fat, shredded scallions, jammy egg, double broth, Katsu, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and Parmesan crusted grilled corn!\n\nThe corn and cheese added some really nice sweetness and umami. The corn was grilled in butter and Togarashi before being cut from the cob and roasted in cheese and oil. \n\nAnyways, this was a fun weekend of Ramen and I learned a lot and experimented which is all Ramen ever should be.

{"title": "Seasoning the soup X using tare in the bowl", "selftext": "I saw a post here asking about this matter, and the comments were basically saying to use tare, without any explanation, which is quite sad. Here is my opinion about this matter. Please leave a comment if you agree/disagree with my points.\n\nRestaurants use tare instead of seasoning the broth in advance for three key reasons:\n\n1. Versatility \u2013 The same broth can be used for shio, shoyu, miso, etc by simply changing the tare. Not seasoning in advance gives flexibility.\n\n2. Preserving Aromas \u2013 During service, restaurant broths are kept boiling or almost boiling for quite long time. If soy sauce or miso is boiled too long, it loses some of its delicate aromas.\n\n3. Consistency \u2013 As the soup evaporates over time, pre-seasoning would concentrate the saltiness, making it harder to maintain a consistent flavor.\n\nAt home, those last 2 points are not that relevant. Unless I\u2019m making a large batch for a party, I don\u2019t find it necessary to follow the restaurant method of adding tare directly to the bowl. Instead, I prefer making and adding the tare into the pan while reheating the soup on the stove.\n\nRestaurants tested their recipes hundreds of times, and have test bowls every single day of service ensuring the exact tare amount provides a balanced bowl. However, at home, where I\u2019m making batch of 6\u20138 portions, I don\u2019t want to waste 2\u20133 portions just to adjust the tare. Adding tare while reheating allows me to fine-tune the taste before serving. If 20ml of tare isn\u2019t enough, I can add a bit more. If the broth is too salty, I can adjust with more broth, dashi, or water\u2014something much harder to do if the tare was already in the bowl.\n\nI would personally recommend that if you are at home, making small batches of ramen, to make a tare and season only the portion you\u2019re serving directly on the pan. If you\u2019ve made 10 portions of broth but only need 2 now, just reheat those 2 portions with the tare, taking care of not letting your soup to boil to avoid any loss in aroma, while tasting and adjusting the flavor. While the soup reheats, you can reheat the bowl, cook the noodles and put the aroma oil in the bowl.\n\nTakuro Yanase, ramen chef of Ramen Break Beats, follows this method\u2014he reheats the soup together with the tare. Although I can\u2019t say for certain if he does this to taste every bowl before serving or if he has other reasons.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/0uhsdwdsizke1.png", "created_utc": 1740358313.0, "score": 106, "author": "FreshBook8963", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ramen/comments/1iwpifo/seasoning_the_soup_x_using_tare_in_the_bowl/", "html_title": ""}

The ramen (I got the basic Tonkotsu bc there was no spicy miso at the time) was the star of the show, with a rich and oily broth that sits in your stomach like a warm hug. But the supporting cast was no slouch either, with the spicy tuna and crispy rice having a delightful hit of jalepeno, the gyoza having the perfect ratio of filling to wrapper, the salad being a refreshing reprieve from the more heavy items, and the curry being the best thing on the menu.

{"title": "Ramen log through our first Japan trip! \ud83c\udf5c", "selftext": "Didn't have as much ramen as I wanted due to an unfortunate stomach ulcer development halfway through the trip (needless to say our preference for rich broths isn't compatible with that haha) but I wanted to share the places we did visit on our first trip!\n\n1. Hakata Furyu, Tokyo: The very last ramen spot we visited! Tonkotsu is my partners absolute favorite ramen and this hit all the marks for him; amazingly rich and flavored pork bone broth, & we loved the shop's policy of up to 2 free noodle refills/kaedama with the option to decide noodle doneness. (kata ftw) There also was a spicy mustard greens pickle that I added way too much of because it balances the fatty broth so well.\n\n2. Gion Duck Noodle, Kyoto: Definitely the most modern style and expensive ramen shop we went to, but that did not make it less delicious. The duck meat was so tender and the clear duck & dashi broth with the sansho pepper was exquisite. As someone with a sensitive stomach that prefers poultry, this was my favorite broth we tried. Also had the most brilliantly colored softboiled yolk, I wish I had a picture.\n\n3. Tenkaippin, Kyoto: We stumbled in here on one of those days where you're starving and looking around on the streets, and no regrets there. Chicken is definitely my preferred kotteri style, and the addition of vegetables to the broth made it not too rich for my palate! As a side note, in general I really enjoyed how much Kyoto cuisine celebrates their vegetables. :)\n\n4. Rokurinsha, Tokyo: We made it an objective to go here after we explored Tokyo Station our first day and saw a queue as early as 7 am. The dipping broth was an amazing pork & seafood flavor, and the thick noodles were SO unctuous and addicting. Each dip was perfectly coated, and converted me from a tsukemen skeptic to a lover since apparently I have only ever had shitty tsukemen til that point lol.\n\n5. Ginza Kagari, Tokyo: Funnily enough, despite being my preferred chicken paitan broth and the shop I was most looking forward to, it was the most disappointing of the bunch. I didn't care for the toppings and the broth had a buttery note beyond the usual richness I did not like much at all. The quality was evidently top notch, but I would not return.\n\n6. Hakata-Nagahama-Ramen Miyoshi, Kyoto: After a nightime hike up Fushimi Inari peak, we swung by this ramen bar since it was open til 1 am. It served the exact job it needed to do for us, and had an amazing spicy menma that added a kick that cut through the tonkotsu broth I don't often see in tonkotsu spots where I'm from. Between this and Furyu, I really wish more tonkotsu shops included complimentary spicy toppings!\n\nCouple end notes:\n\n1. I am now a firm believer in Japanese negi over standard green onions, I could eat SPOONFULS of it haha.\n\n2. Next time I want to try more styles with assari broth, like Tokyo style ramen. My partner is very ambivalent to them but I love them and it would certainly be kinder to my stomach. :p\n\n3.
