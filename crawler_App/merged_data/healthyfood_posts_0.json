{"title": "Managed to kick all processed sugar out of my diet\u2026the result", "selftext": "Drinking my coffee black, no more cereal, now it\u2019s steel cut oatmeal with just a small bit of raw, pure honey. No more desserts, milk, etc.\n\nI cut back drastically on sugar a few months ago now have completely cut it out. I\u2019m sort of amazed at the results on my taste buds.\n\nWithout all that sugar constantly bombarding my pallet I feel like my taste receptors have sort of reset themselves. All fruit is tasting absolutely amazing now. Strawberries are no longer too tart. Heck, I\u2019ve even started eating grapefruit and now really like the flavor. Right now an orange is my dessert and I absolutely look forward to it. It\u2019s like eating candy. It tastes delicious.\n\nI\u2019ve also sort of started to embrace the more natural flavors of bitter and tart. I now like the taste of black coffee. It has a nice nutty, acidic, sweet yet bitter taste. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m finally able to sense how food is suppose to taste. My food is requiring less salt too to taste good. I\u2019m enjoying the raw, more natural flavors of things way more.\n\nLike last night\u2019s dinner: red, yellow, orange pepper slices and pork cubes saut\u00e9ed with garlic, onion, ginger, turmeric, cayenne pepper, paprika over brown rice. Used much less salt than I normally did and absolutely loved the flavors.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve always loved to cook and absolutely love grocery shopping. I guess that helps.\n\nI also stopped drinking 6 months ago and have put myself on a steady exercise routine of cardio, strength training and stretching/yoga. Before this as a middle age male I was way over my ideal weight, my joints/knees hurt constantly, bad sleep, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve lost 30lbs so far, my joints/knees have stopped hurting, I have way more energy for my children, my memory has improved, I\u2019m more alert. I just feel so much better.\n\nEDIT 2: This was a long, slow process. I didn't go cold turkey. It took 6 months, carefully eliminating 1 thing at a time, adding in healthy options.

{"title": "/r/HealthyFood Rules - Be sure to go over this before participating in the subreddit", "selftext": "Welcome to /r/HealthyFood.  This sub is for discussion of specified foods which may be considered good for us.\n\n---\n\n# Subreddit Content Focus\n\n Posts should be an examination of a specified meal and its components. See rule 4 below for specific post requirements.\n\n**On topic:** *\"Here's what I ate, what do you think of it?\"*  \n**Off topic:** *\"What should I eat?\"*\n\n**What the subreddit focus is about** \n\n* **The food** - /r/HealthyFood is currently limited to posts which share a single meal and ***is for sole focus on the food*** and its nutritional content *without any other context*. Posts should be akin to the /r/food subreddit but for food with a more healthful composition. \n\n**What the subreddit focus is not about** \n\n* **The person** - The following kinds of discussion should be directed to a subreddit more directly oriented to their topics or to a health professional: diet, food naming or listing requests, health concerns, fitness, categories of foods, general nutrition, and artificial foods or supplements. \n\n* **Fitness, diet, or medical / health related concerns** - *Discuss your diet with a professional who, unlike participants here, can base their advice on a proper background and education, test results, your medical history, and your eating trends / habits / issues*\n\n* **Bashing on others** - DO NOT bash people for questions about specific foods / food items, or not consuming something to your standard of perfection\n\n* **Activism or crusading** - It's fine to have a preference. Be diverse in your participation. Being an argument looking for a place to happen is not okay. Hyperbolic or inflammatory engagement is not okay\n\n\n---\n\n# Educate, don't berate\n\n**Keep your cool and maintain perspective. Assume people are here to learn. Offer advice and counter opinions respectfully and include links to support your claims.**\n\nPeople are here to learn - They do so by asking about their food, their recipe improvement attempts, and the science as they understand it (which may or may not be accurate). If you see something offered or stated which you don't believe to be \"healthy\" or factual, rather than get angry at them, respond to offer info with sources\n\nPeople are built different and have different needs - Everybody is not the same and that's okay. People come in a variety of shapes, needs, and points of view.  What may be good for you may not be ideal for someone else\n\nGetting shitty isn't going to help - How angry / right / informative you think you are is never an exception from the rules.  Being a dick does not succeed in anything except you coming across like a dick. It doesn't change minds or get anyone to consider your point.  Walk away if you are upset.  Report it if something violates the rules\n\n---\n\n# The Rules of /r/HealthyFood\n\nThe rule titles below are sufficient for 99.999% of participants. Most of this is to deal with spammers and those with food based anger issues.  Unfortunately, the added detail for each rule has made this lengthy. Thank all the rule lawyers and bad actors out there who made it necessary\n\n\n### 1)  [Reddiquette+](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) is required. Don't be a dick\n\n* Disagreements are fine but personal attacks and insults are not. Trolling, insults, or antagonism towards participants, moderators, or even the community itself will result in a ban\n* No witch hunts or vote complaining\n* No complaint posts or comments about this or any other subreddit.  Use modmail to discuss concerns about rules and moderation\n* Don't make generalizations about the subreddit or participants - It's not backed by actual data and is rarely accurate.  Don't go there just because others did not emphatically agree or vote your way\n* Avoid rude non-constructive comments - don't call someone's food disgusting, gross, or make any other non-constructive criticisms\n* If you claim something is unhealthy, do so respectfully and provide a source (with links)^*\n* Food / Diet / Portion shaming is not allowed - Assumptions, especially by shamers, are frequently wrong. People don't all have the same goals.  A picture may show something that is a rare treat or meant for more than one. Food images here often contain swaps for healthier ingredients but are meant to appear as something else. Don't assume, ask. Don't shame.\n\n\n\n### 2) No dietary activism / crusading\n\nPresenting a food based POV is fine as long as it is done *respectfully* and abides by the rules. Diet wars and diet crusading are NOT welcome in this subreddit. Being a diet fan is fine. Being either a jerk diet fan or anti-fan is not okay. DO NOT;\n\n* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets / beliefs** - It's fine to disagree. Be informative without being rude\n* **engage in diet crusading or food shaming** - instead, post an example of what you think is good\n* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**\n* **promote or argue ethics and morals** - this is often intended to be inflammatory or to shame. It is always off topic from the focus of this subreddit as morality and ethical labels do not change the nutritional aspects of food items.\n* **promote diet absolutism** - your preferred diet is not the only healthy one. You CAN say \"it is best for me\" and explain what your favorite food approach emphasizes nutritionally.\n* **make specious claims** - claiming a diet cures a chronic illness is not allowed.  Saying it \"can control the symptoms of\" is fine if that is truly the case but sources should be cited\n* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - towards any subreddit, its posts, or comments\n* **bias whine** - \"I'm downvoted because I'm (name food POV)\" is just shit stirring and a hollow attempt at playing victim / martyr\n* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - avoid promoting a related sub no more than 1/10 of your activity\n\n### 3) No self-promotion\n\nThis sub is under constant bombardment from spammers and self-promoters.  The moderators do not have the time to be wishy washy about this. **Any violation of this rule will result in a ban**\n\nYou may not post or comment here to discuss, link to, or include content from anything you are affiliated with, including; your works, service, product, app, article, blog, site, youtube or other video, survey, market research, funding drive, social media account, etc. Accounts showing up here with descriptions or history involving spam or promotion may be banned.\n\n### 4) Post requirements\n\n* **ALL posts require an approval process** \n* **Required post type and focus** - Posts must be an image of a single meal and will require an added info comment for approval (refer to the directions message sent to you after submitting the post). *The post's sole focus must be on the food itself, the single meal depicted.* \n* **Post context NOT allowed** - it may not include any context regarding personal food habits or goals, requests to list or name foods, diet, what's *bad* for you, fitness, medical concerns, health issues, cure claims, artificial food, or supplements. No Meta content (use modmail)\n* **Image restrictions** - A single meal image only. No video, memes, screencaps, product or nutrition labels, other images with text. or any kind of placeholder image\n* **Spam and promotion** - ZERO tolerance. ZERO chance of being approved and *will only result in a ban*. Do not link to or submit content from your own site, blog, video channel, social media, etc.\n* **Add the required info comment** - After you submit the post, the following info must then be added to the comment section for post approval  \n\n   > > **Name:** (name of the meal depicted)  \n   > > **Macro / micro nutrient focus:** (Identify at least 2 which are abundant or minimal in the food shown. Naming categories of foods or diet types does not qualify)  \n   > > **Ingredients list or Recipe:**  (what's in it or how do you make it)\n\n### 5) No YouTube or other video\n\nDue to the *extremely* high rate of YouTube and other video content sharing here being spam, off-topic, or having gross misinformation, all links and refences to YouTube and other video sources are no longer allowed and will be removed. Don't share, show, link, discuss, or identify videos / channels. Attempting to end run the rule via any means may result in a ban. *We mean it. No youtube or other video.*\n\n### 6) New, low karma, and underage accounts are restricted\n\n* Accounts which are new - May not post. Can participate in the comments. Spend a few weeks getting to know reddit and the sub before posting \n* Accounts with low / no karma - May not post. Can participate in the comments   \n* Accounts with negative karma - May not post. Accounts with more than a little negative karma may not comment  \n* Accounts by minors - May not post or make any form of dietary advice requests. *Do not give dietary advice to those under 18*  \n\n*Note: Account age and karma amounts change periodically based on spam control needs*\n\n### ...and that may not cover everything\n\nThough extremely rare, posts and comments may be removed and accounts may be banned at moderator discretion for reasons other than those stated in the rules. It is not possible to provide a rule for every potential problem. For example, there is no rule regarding nuclear secrets yet we would not allow posts or comments about them in the sub. The best advice we can offer on this is; Don't be a dick in any way\n\n---\n\n## About user flair\n\nIn order to encourage comment participants to use and give heavier consideration to sourced claims, automod will set a user's flair to 'cites source' for a user when they include a link to any source in their last top level comment here (a top level comment is a response to the post, not to another comment)\n\n---\n\n## About modmails and appeals\n\nNearly without exception, removals, bans, and modmails about confusion are a result of skipping or skimming  rules and notices.\n\nWe currently have *less than* 3 human mods for a sub of over 3 million subscribers.  Spam requires most of our volunteer resources. We simply don't have spare time to wade in the mud of bad faith engagement.\n\n*When modmailing, bad faith interaction, especially being dishonest, disingenuous, rude, antagonistic, or indignant, will always be counter productive and dead ends conversation.* Instead, be honest, straightforward, aware of the rules, and have self-awareness if you violated them. If you have a heated chip on your shoulder, take a breath before responding.\n\nThings that are not a consideration for appeals; votes, what other people or subs do, your intent, what something costs, the amount of help / info you think you can provide, opinions of the rules, your favorite sweater, etc. Following the rules, being topical, or otherwise going out bounds are the only considerations\n\n**Before appealing a removal** \n\nRead removal notices, rules, and posting page notices. Removal notices provide the reason and state your options. \n\n**Before appealing a ban** - \n\n* take a breath and be civil, understand any antagonism or other bad faith engagement will end discussion\n* read communications to you from the mod team including automod. The ban notice states the ban reason and provides a link to relevant context (more than one comment or post may be involved)\n* ban discussion and appeals are only handled via a response to the ban message. Do not create new modmail chains to discuss your ban \n* requests for an immediate undoing of a ban because you are new or suddenly found awareness of rules and notices will NOT be granted. There is ample heads up about the rules and the need to follow them.  There are no free passes.\n\n\n---\n\n## Moderators needed\n\nWe'd like to add about a dozen moderators. Working to make a positive place means dealing with the negatives so this is not 'fun'. You have to deal with pests and weeds and put in work regularly to have a great garden.  If you want to help, have more than a year of history on reddit, can offer a little time every day, and aren't a dietary crusader, send us a modmail and ask about joining the mod team.\n\n---\n\n^* About \"that's unhealthy\" comments - If you have a differing opinion from the poster or others in the comments about what is healthy, it's fine to disagree provided you A) help them understand your view by backing the claim with links to sources and B) avoid being rude about it in any way. Nobody is censoring you and in fact, we are striving for the opposite. *We want you to effectively get your point across*. We want people to learn from each other and to do so it should be a discussion based on science, not \"because I said so\", which is why we require the citation links. You get to give an opinion backed by facts and help others understand your point when you add links to sources. It is positive and productive and has an actual chance of convincing others to look at it from your perspective. It also gives the other party a chance to examine what you are basing your belief on and counter any possible misunderstandings you might have.

{"title": "r/HealthyFood subreddit update - Post changes", "selftext": "Hi,\n\n## The problem\n\nPosts are getting a bit outside the scope of the sub more frequently. These kinds of posts consistently involve critical information gaps by posters and responders. There is also a problem of not having enough moderators for a sub of this size (we'll cover that concern at the end). Therefore, some key changes will be made to this subreddit in order to get things back to center for its topic, focus, and purpose.\n\nThe misunderstanding some are having about this sub is like confusing a cat subreddit for a pet subreddit. A cat is a pet but the cat sub is not the right sub for dog questions. We're getting the equivalent of a LOT of dog questions, lizard questions, snake questions, rabbit cage design questions, etc. \n\nSome people, most often site and sub newcomers, are getting confused and even angry that this sub isn't an anything-ever-possibly-related-to-food sub. \n\n**What the sub is:** It's for focus on the food itself, specific food, a meal the poster wants to share and get info and opinions on. This sub was founded as a sibling to the food subreddit where posters share food they've had, but here it also focuses on the meal's content and composition, including any ingredient changes made to improve nutritional value, increased or reduced macro / micro values (note the use of *improve*, not *achieved perfection*).\n\n**What the sub is not:** a general nutrition, diet, and health concern consultation forum. The focus needs to get back to being food / specific meal centric, not overarching personal diet, broad food categories, or general nutrition centric.\n\n**You can consult more than one friend / source:** For some questions, another sub may be the better option and that's a good thing. There are several great subreddits which specifically focus on the topic of diet, budget, fitness, general nutrition, and combinations thereof. For example, /r/eatcheapandhealthy and /r/nutrition are great subs related to food and nutrition, each with their own focus, Please add the power of other subs to your info arsenal and enjoy conversing there too with the people who are dedicated to discussing those topics.\n\n*EDIT - Another reason why this sub needs to focus solely on the food and not the person is there is an inherent problem with diet, health concern, and personal context related posts on reddit which is far more concerning than being outside the intent of the sub: The reality is that without these things, which are never provided and would be too personal to do so here, responses are blind guesses that have more than a small possibility of being wrong and can even be dangerous: proper testing, medical history, activity patterns, family history, and an evaluation from an accredited professional who is fully and properly educated in their specialization staying up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. Whereas what happens here is 1) an anonymous person with no accountability will be making wild guesses 2) based on extremely limited and incomplete information provided about the personal scenario and 3) the advice provided tends to be an assessment based on a couple of skimming glances of semi related social media posts sometimes rising to paraphrasing of studies except often done poorly. Responders are very rarely offering links to studies or proper sources of information. This is even before we get to the problem of trolls pretending to be professionals and worse, scumbags who intentionally and maliciously give dangerous advice. No offense folks since we all know the person asking and the vast majority of people answering mean well but this information shortfall from all angles resulting in blind guesswork with more than a small potential for being off the mark is the reality behind the advice going on for these kinds of posts on reddit.*\n\nNow for a short non-commercial break from the heaviness of this topic, ala derp cats https://redd.it/16e9cb1  \n...and back to the program...\n\n## Changes to this sub\n\n**Front page posts** - Going forward, this subreddit will be returning to its founding purpose. Front page posts will be limited to \"here's the healthful food I ate\" type image posts. The current added info comment requirement for food image posts will remain in place so participants get ingredient / recipe info as well as macro / micro notes for the food shown. **Text posts will be off the board until enough volunteers have joined the mod team to keep up with them**. \n\n**The promotion post** - this is going away. The sub will simply no longer allow spam / promotion anywhere in the forum.\n\n**A new weekly pinned info / help request post (starting Monday)** - We don't like people getting confused or angry for wanting help while misunderstanding and being road blocked for it. Therefore, this pinned post will be provided for those who want to ask things here which are food related but are tangential to the sub purpose. These kinds of queries include;\n\n* anything diet oriented - requests for diet analysis, food / drink suggestions, evaluations, \"how much\", \"too much\", \"is this bad for me?\" etc. \n* general nutrition and food category queries - broad food groups like \"dairy\", \"meat\", \"vegetables\", \"melons\", etc. rather than single meal specific\n* and for now, anything else that would've been a text post, anything which isn't about a single specific meal with an image of the food shared for discussion\n* Note: queries with any context involving a health issue, concern, diagnosis, treatment, etc. will continue to be out of bounds for this sub and will be auto removed (refer to a professional)\n\n\nWe want folks to get their desired info / discussion pertaining to food but we need the sub front page to be clear at a glance what its purpose / topic is so newcomer confusion is kept to a minimum. \n\nWe should have made adjustments when the sub hit major growth, putting topical guardrails in place to prevent the deviation from getting to the level it has. Apologies for that, we've been busy with other mod needs (see below). Taking the steps now to restrict the front page to the sub purpose and adding a weekly (or more frequent) info / help discussion post for food related queries seems to be the best way to get things back on track.\n\n---\n\n## Moderator help is urgently needed\n\nWe have only three active human moderators for a sub of over 3 million subscribers. Because of poorly thought out changes by the site regarding third party apps, our bot help has recently been crippled. For years, we've been way beyond the point of needing more volunteers for the mod team and we're at a breaking point.\n\nPretty much all our volunteer time is taken up dealing with spammers / scammers. The ratio of spam to legit content here is unusually high compared to other subs. As for the non-spam posts, we simply don't have the eyeball resources to analyze every text post for topical relevance or time to debate it. To open the sub up to other kinds of posts again isn't going to be realistic without bringing additional mod volunteers on board.\n\nVolunteers with moderating experience would be great but we're happy to give pointers to those who are new to it.\n\nThings you need to know if you want to mod: Scammers go to amazing lengths. Bot / AI engagement here is going on much more than you think. People can get to ugly mode fast and some are dangerous. The issues which have to be addressed rarely are just what they seem on the surface so you'll have to enjoy detective work. Site admin support is really bad and claims regarding their efforts tend to prove hollow. Yes, it can get bad like kids pretending to be doctors while intentionally giving malicious advice for funsies or a pervert posting to the person they're stalking their desire to violently hurt the child target (yep, it happened here and site admin refused to help or even talk to us about it). Moderating is not glorious. Shit gets (un)real\n\nIf you are interested in helping out, please read [this post](https://redd.it/ork4px) for more info.\n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/16eexad/rhealthyfood_subreddit_update_post_changes/", "created_utc": 1694289026.0, "score": 15, "author": "soundeziner", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/HealthyFood/comments/16eexad/rhealthyfood_subreddit_update_post_changes/", "html_title": ""}

It's more neutral tasting and adds a cheesecake-y consistency. \n\nAgain, not hating on greek yogurt. I love it for a smooth creamy ingredient with fruit, granola, oats, converting into dips, but for a smoothie, CC is the way!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/15nh9og/cottage_cheese_over_greek_yogurt/", "created_utc": 1691685235.0, "score": 42, "author": "None", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/HealthyFood/comments/15nh9og/cottage_cheese_over_greek_yogurt/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I'm bored of just drinking water, so what else do you drink?", "selftext": "A little bit of context: I'm honestly not a very healthy person and I live a pretty sedentary life, but about a year ago I started trying to at least watch my intake of things like sugar/sodium/etc. I ended up cutting out sodas and really most other drinks entirely, having only bottled or tap water. Now, about a year later, I've tried to branch out and find other drinks that aren't just plain ol' water yet aren't chock full of sugar or some problematic sweetener. I'm back to having a specialty soda or a ginger ale very occasionally; not even because I miss soda, but because I just want something different.\n\nLooking into this kind question already, tons of answers end up suggesting sparkling waters, seltzers, and infused waters. Now normally I'm not a picky eater, but having tried all of these on several occasions, I just don't like them for different reasons. I've also tried kombucha but it sorta turned my stomach, which was a bummer, and I don't know whether or not one should be drinking that constantly due to the bacteria anyway (correct me if I'm wrong, I just don't know). I also tried coconut water a long time ago, and while I didn't like it at the time, I think I'll give it another shot now that I think about it. I've always enjoyed some cold teas or juices, but finding things that I can drink frequently throughout the day without overloading on sugar has been the main challenge.\n\nTL;DR - Aside from water and its spinoffs, what things do you guys like to drink on the regular? Is anyone else picky with sparking/seltz/infused waters but found a kind that you like?

Press the Tofu to remove excess moisture: Wrap the Tofu block in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, place it in a large plate, and put a heavy object on top (such as a book or a plate with cans). Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes to press out the liquid. Drain and repeat in 5 minute intervals until you think the liquid is mostly removed.\n\n2.) Slice the pressed tofu into thin cubed strips.\n\n\\*For more spongey texture, and maximum absorbency while marinating, freeze overnight after slicing and thaw out in the fridge the next day.\n\n3.) When you're ready to move on, use a Mortar and Pestle to finely crush the Fish Mint leaves. Do not attempt to dry cook or dehydrate the leaves for any reason, as Fish Mint loses potency if the oils in the leaf dry out.\n\n4.) In a bowl filled with 1 cup of water, combine the finely crushed Fish Mint leaves, Nori Powder, Black Salt, Tamari, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, and White Pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.\n\n5.) Place the tofu slices in a shallow dish or container and pour the marinade over them. Make sure all sides are coated evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or longer for a stronger fish-like flavor. \\*For the strongest flavor, refrigerate the tofu and let it marinate overnight for better results!\n\n6.) After marinating, remove the tofu and transfer it to a plate. Sprinkle Corn starch over the tofu, coating each piece evenly.\n\n\\*Before you start cooking, you should consider using the marinade to make a liquid to baste the Tofu as you cook it. You can either strain the marinade as is, or for stronger flavor, just use a Food Processor on high power, then strain it. Boil the marinade medium heat and reduce the marinade to a watery gravy consistency.\n\n7.) Heat Sesame oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat.\n\n8.) Carefully place the tofu slices in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden and crispy. While cooking, spoon small amounts of the leftover marinade onto the tofu for added flavor.\n\n9.)

{"title": "Just wanted to share a few prepped salad tips that have worked for me lately.", "selftext": "I posted a while ago asking for healthy snack tips, and how to eat more salads without hating my life.. so I want to share the results with you in case you have similar goals.\n\nTo eat more salads I bought the large container of pre washed mixed greens. I used to wash them too but I'm trying to be less anal about it and I haven't been washing them if it says pre washed. I've been buying different trail mix bags and leaving them on the counter (even though I hate clutter, but if I have the trail mix on the counter it will remind me to eat that instead of something else, or remind me to make the salad). My favorite hack lately has been pre making the dressing with one of those teeny Tupperwares. I mixed olive oil, balsamic, fresh lemon juice, a little bit of honey, salt, and pepper in a Tupperware. I used it for almost a week and it honestly tasted fine all week after a quick stir.\n\nI prepped a can of chick peas by draining them and rinsing them and storing them in a Tupperware in the fridge. My cheat portion in the salad is the croutons, if you love croutons just sneak a few in or if you have the discipline to refrain from using croutons then your salad would be even healthier ! To prep the chicken I made a week's worth of instant pot chicken breast. I froze one or two and defrosted them as the days went on. I had almost a week's worth of salads with mixed greens, trail mix (cranberries, almonds, seeds, pistachios, etc), chicken, croutons, chick peas, and homemade dressing. I did not take the extra effort to chop additional vegetables for the salad, but maybe some days I will. I have a very large Tupperware that I throw most of the dry ingredients in and then I just stuff the Tupperware of dressing in that same Tupperware and I don't mix the dressing in until I am about to eat the salad.\n\nIf you really hate prepping chicken, one day I purchased frozen grilled chicken out of desperation for time that week and to be honest it tasted fine on a salad. Just went in the microwave for a couple of minutes to defrost. If you're vegetarian just substitute chicken with hard boiled eggs. If you're vegan, just skip both and it is still pretty filling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/13ndwi7/just_wanted_to_share_a_few_prepped_salad_tips/", "created_utc": 1684629183.0, "score": 95, "author": "cutefuzzythings", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/HealthyFood/comments/13ndwi7/just_wanted_to_share_a_few_prepped_salad_tips/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Help with Golden Milk!!", "selftext": "Okay, hopefully, I can FINALLY get this to post ***somewhere!!***\n\nAnyways, I found a recipe online for making Golden Milk. It was something like:\n\n1. 1tsp turmeric\n2. 1tsp cinnamon\n3. 2tsp local raw honey\n4. 2-pinches of ground black, white, and red pepper\n5. 1tsp of ground ginger\n6. 1cup of A2 whole milk \n\nAccording to the recipe, this would be 2 servings. \n\nIt said to mix ingredients and bring it to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Okay, so I did all of that; great! Now the issue... no matter *what* I tried to strain this through - I did not have cheesecloth, so that isn't something I was able to try - it would ***not*** strain. And I mean **at all!** I tried using a wet coffee filter - NOPE, it didn't work, and in fact, it was the only thing that didn't even allow a drop of liquid through! Next, I tried using a wet napkin. Again, this did not work! However, I did get a couple of drops through before it invariably stopped dripping (I even tried using a spoon to sort of pull away any of the \"clumps\" from the seasonings). The only other thing I had that I could try was a washcloth. I figured since washcloths are very porous, this would work, but because of how porous it was, I expected some of the 'seasonings' to get through into the drink, but this didn't work either!! In the end, I put a couple of wet coffee filters under the rag and sort of gently squeezed them to get what little liquid I could get from this. I ended up with less than 1/4 of a cup! \n\nSo, my question is for anyone that has made this drink before - obviously, it may not be the exact same recipe I used as there are a crazy number of different recipes for this out there - how the hell did you manage to actually strain this so you could get more than a few drops out of the final product? I'd like to make it again, as what little I managed to get tasted pretty good, and the health benefits are pretty substantial, but there is no way I will make it again if I cannot even strain the crap! \n\nI want to go ahead and thank anyone that provides a solution to this problem for their time and assistance. (I also spent a long time trying to find a solution to this prior to making a post, but 99% of what I got were just damned recipes for golden milk!
