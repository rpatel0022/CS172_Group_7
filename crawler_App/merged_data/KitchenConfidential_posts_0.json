The time to give a shit was November.", "selftext": "This situation is not a surprise to anyone who was paying attention before the election.   I'm a hospitality refugee who left the industry in 2020 after my store closed.  I'm out of the trenches so maybe I have more time to watch and read the news these days but I gotta call it out.  This industry by definition is full of hard working boots on the ground people but there may be less class consciousness in kitchens than any other blue collar profession.  The IBEW is currently at war internally over members supporting union busting republicans.  But there's no such organization or even argument among kitchen staff.  Where the hell are the adults in the room? \n\nSeriously, we're not all 16 year old dishwashers.  But the proof is in the pudding, the 18-30 year olds here didn't show up to vote for Kamala.  They didn't show up anywhere but I'd bet the portion of younger non-college educated people in kitchens is higher than your average industry.  And we're easily more female populated than plumbers and ironworkers.  And yet all the red hat wearing work truck drivers voted and we didn't.  \n\nSo what's my point?  To please please please learn something from this pain.  Watching your best staff get deported sucks way worse than waking up an hour early on a Tuesday in November.  Watching your produce cost eat up another year of staff raises sucks way worse than burning a few hours of PTO to take a half day on a Tuesday in November.  Watching a fucking Nazi salute at the inauguration should be an obvious sign that you fucked up if you chose not to vote last year.  \n\nThis isn't solely our fault but it's all of our problem now. If you're 20 years old and never gave a shit about elections I guess it's time to learn. If you're 30 and think nothing ever changes why bother, well I guess it's time to learn.  If you're a-political and hate that we even have to talk about this guess what?  Me fucking too, I wish I didn't have to say this either.  But shit's hitting the fan and here we are.  \n\nRemember this misery in 2026 and 2028.  Hold a fucking grudge.  Get angry.  Show the fuck up next time.

{"title": "How fucked am I?", "selftext": "For context, I\u2019m the PM Grill Cook (and \u201cpm lead without the title\u201d as described by my executive Sous - the one I\u2019m talking with here) at the hospital cafe I work at. We strive to do pretty good quality food, and make it fun. We go all out for Mardi Gras, busting out two extra stations and running extra specials all day long. This is totally reasonable and doable during our lunch period, but after 2:30, it\u2019s just me and a 58 year old cashier whose cooking skills amount to assembling a ham and cheese sandwich. \n\nSo yesterday, after pumping out several batches of beignet dough before heading out to run the cafe as the sole cook, I\u2019m told \u201chey by the way, you need to take over king cake production.\u201d I figure that\u2019s fine, I can rock it while taking care of the cafe. Head out to find the cafe line in complete shambles. Flatty is black and crusted over, sticky and greasy counters, black fryer oil, nothing on the line is restocked and most items are 3/4 empty, and all the ice baths are completely melted. Morning crew just left all this shit, knowing I would have to clean it up. So I delay king cake production to lock in on making the line decent enough to cook out of again and not scare away our customers, because this is open concept and the doctors will not order food if the place looks like shit. Between cleaning and taking/cooking orders, I get to the time for my lunch without being able to run any of my usual pre-lunch cleaning that will let me close on time. Come back from lunch, start king cake production. As soon as I get one dough batch rolled out, 3 whole families of 4-8 come down and need service. After that wave, I keep ping-ponging between cake and grill and sometimes even the cash register because my cashier takes a whole 30 minutes to slice a ham and turkey. Finally finish king cake production at 7:10, 20 minutes to close. Nothing\u2019s done. I\u2019m veritably fucked.\n\nWork as fast as I can, maximizing efficiency as much as possible. Prep cart is fucked. No labels on anything. Completely disordered, raw sausage on the top rack and lettuce right beside it. Wrap jobs are ass. Have to redo the whole thing, restructure it, and get it decent. Weigh out all our waste and food donations. Still haven\u2019t cleaned a damn thing, and it\u2019s 7:45.\n\nSo then, finally, I get to cleaning. Housekeepers come in and say that a banquet was left in one of the least used conference rooms over the weekend. So of course, I gotta go take care of that too. All told, I\u2019m out by 10:25. My off time is supposed to be 8:30. Texted chef, and the above was his response.\n\n\u201cNo more overtime.\u201d Really man? What the fuck am I supposed to do, just leave the place a wreck? It feels so passive aggressive, and I can\u2019t help but feel like there\u2019s a write up waiting for me when I get there. How fucked do y\u2019all think I am?

The server, who is fairly new, told them she was sorry and she didn\u2019t want them to leave unhappy. She would go and see what she can do. She wanted to know if she should discount or Comp.  They ate all six tacos btw.\n\nSo the MIT and my partner start talking about how to apologize. Basically kiss their butts. I shouted NO NO NO NO!  I told her to take the check to the table say \u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t like your tacos\u201d and drop the check.  Absolutely no discount. She was surprised.  \n\nI told her that it is always my policy that if a customer is nice about a complaint I will bend over backwards to make them happy.   However, as soon as he cursed at his server, was a disrespectful dick, I\u2019d rather he spend his money somewhere else. \n\nThey just paid the bill and walked out of the restaurant so fast they were almost running. Embarrassed?  Mad?  I don\u2019t care. After 25 years owning my own restaurants and Almost 40 years in the business, I will always have my employees backs when it comes to rude customers. \n\nIt is amazing how many people do not understand that you will get a lot further by just being kind.

{"title": "An opinion on why restaurant staff is in short supply", "selftext": "I keep reading about restaurants and the shortage of staff. As a 22 year industry veteran, I have a theory.\n\nPre-pandemic, we worked our asses off. Those of us in the restaurant industry did our thing. The pay wasn\u2019t always great. The conditions weren\u2019t always awesome. However, every day, we went back because we loved it. We were passionate about the work and loved those we worked with.\n\nThen, Covid hit. We still did our thing. We hustled to feed people. We wore our masks in hot kitchens. We increased our work load, without extra pay, in order to maintain safety when it came to our guests. Americans still needed to eat and we kept working. \n\nThen, it started. The customers started their shit. While I\u2019m obviously not referring to everyone, the number of rude, uncaring individuals in our restaurants increased... a lot. Many hard working restaurant employees were yelled at, cussed out, put down, threatened with violence and spat on. I can\u2019t tell you how many absolutely abhorrent people I personally dealt with. Through social media, I saw that I wasn\u2019t alone. This pandemic brought out the true nature of a lot of regular people. That true nature was ugly and disgusting. I\u2019d seen a lot in my time in the business, but this was just more than any person should deal with. All of this on top of our own covid stress and worries. \n\nThat being said, yes, there are probably some people just sitting around collecting a check. Most of us however have simply chosen to find a new industry. Personally, I will never return to a restaurant. I have scoped my job search down. I\u2019m looking to learn new skills. I\u2019m starting my own small business on the side. \n\nSo, if you want to know why restaurant workers aren\u2019t returning, it\u2019s because we\u2019re tired of adults who act like children. Im sorry, but your Starbucks will continue to close at 1:00, your order will take an extra 20 minutes, and your favorite place might be closed an extra day every week for a while. Many of us are over the way too many members of the general public act and we\u2019re just not willing to deal with it anymore.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards. There is an awful  lot of feeling and emotion in your comments. We\u2019ve all been through the ringer.

{"title": "I run a seasonal restaurant that is extremely high volume and open for an extremely short amount of time. I don\u2019t do any allergy requests. Am I unreasonable?", "selftext": "We have a remote, quick service restaurant that gets absolutely slammed for two months while school is out every summer. Think like a national park restaurant, in a lodge and the only one for miles. I usually have to hire people (often students) with little or no experience because we have such a short season and are so remote (the major bottleneck is I have to house every employee, which we do for no charge). We have an extremely small staff that makes a ton of overtime and tips.\n\nIn the summer months, it is literally about survival. Get the food out the door. Keep employees happy and not burnt out so they don\u2019t quit and I have to shorten the menu because it is pretty much impossible to rehire after the season has started. We often get an employee a servsafe cert, teach them the menu, and train them on a station in a week. And then immediately, it is peak season.\n\nWe have a lot of burgers/sandwiches. Gluten is everywhere. We have three different shrimp items because people order them nonstop. We have tickets all day long. I close the kitchen for an hour just so I\u2019m certain the kitchen doesn\u2019t go without some sort of break. An allergy station that I am confident taking on the liability of just is not in the cards for us.\n\nSo anyways we tell customers \u201cWe can omit items on request but we do not have the resources to accommodate critical ingredient omissions. If anything on our menu will cause you a reaction if ingested, we advise that you do not order food with us.\u201d\n\nI have done this for many years. I believe we are being considerate, that it is better than giving someone a serious reaction. We are being honest about what we are capable of. We also have a little store next that people could buy items from. We even don\u2018t care if people bring in food so they can eat with their friends on our deck, and we have many people who do this.\n\nI\u2019ve just had a serious uptick in recent seasons of absolutely furious customers (often on our busiest days) when I tell them we can\u2019t accommodate them. Wondering what your professional thoughts are.\n\nEdit: It seems most of you are on the same page as me and I appreciate the replies. I think like everything else sometimes I dwell too much on the negative and the unreasonably irate customers stick out in my head for too long. And because I didn\u2019t really say it: we do have options. I have gluten free buns and a couple other gluten free items. We have vegan and vegetarian items. We have a salad bar free of gluten or animal products. BUT we are clear that it is not 100%. There is no way we can be a gluten free kitchen. We charbroil shrimp on the same equipment that we toast all our buns. Impossible burgers are cooked on the same flat top as normal burgers, and our fries are in the same oil as chicken tenders (ie not vegan). And we have the general store with a ton of 711 style packaged items they are free to eat in the restaurant.\n\nAfter seeing all your replies I have thought about it and I think that when I tell someone if it is a serious intolerance they should not eat with us it is like I am calling them out. It\u2019s like saying \u201cAdmit that it is not a real allergy or critical intolerance or you can\u2019t have the food you want.\u201d Kind of a tough spot to be in and the reaction I get is not surprising I guess. This is for the people who it is not a serious issue for, of course.

{"title": "Remembering the time that I walked from a restaurant and they closed.", "selftext": "I worked at this bistro for 3 years, I was the sous chef for the final year. Almost to the day. Like the title says, I walked and they closed.\n\nMother\u2019s Day week, I worked 106 hours and slept there once. Only paid for 50, since I was on salary, which amounted to $404 in 2022. That in itself is some shit, but I wouldn\u2019t have left over it. Day after Mother\u2019s Day, the owner tells me I\u2019m not doing enough for the company. I was flabbergasted and sat with it all day.\n\nThe next morning, like 7am, I was out back with the executive chef smoking a couple cigarettes before putting together a catering and it just hit me like a ton of bricks, I\u2019m not doing this anymore.\n\nI looked at the executive chef and exact words said \u201cit\u2019s been real man, I\u2019m going home\u201d. He laughed and then looked at me all concerned like really? \u201cYeah dude I\u2019m for real, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m out. It\u2019s been a long ass week, it\u2019s been a long ass day (remember it was like 7am I just got there), it\u2019s been real dawg, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\nHe went upstairs without a word, I wrote burn baby burn on the dumpster, and then got 2 trash bags full of all of the equipment I brought in from home for them, I stuffed 2 beers in my pocket, nodded to the EC and drove off.\n\nYou bet your ass that wasn\u2019t even close to the first straw. I talked to one of my old employees after they closed and he said after I left it was complete mayhem, they couldn\u2019t keep staff, cleaning went undone, they couldn\u2019t find another lunatic to fill the role of sous there obviously, the EC got burned to the ground (hate that for him), hard drugs spread like a wildfire, food quality dropped massively, they eventually stopped getting their biggest catering customers and that bitch closed. For reference, our local food magazine voted us best restaurant of the previous year (my town is only 40k population). Lo and behold, I leave and they\u2019re wiped off the map. Smiling as I type this. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m the reason they were open, I\u2019m not that arrogant, but I was the glue that held that kitchen together. Who didn\u2019t do enough for your company? You fucking cunt, eat shit.\n\nA short victory story for under appreciated chefs everywhere.

{"title": "BOH drug use.", "selftext": "So I posted earlier about a coworker who was having issues with drugs. He was heavy into fentanyl, Percocet, meth, cocaine, not to mention he is a heavy alcoholic. He spends his thousand dollar check every week on getting loaded and then expects us to carry him the rest of the way. I actually like the guy. He's a kick ass chef when he's not nodding out over some eggs or a steak or when he's not hiding in the walk in or falling asleep at Starbucks on his 10. We have all been pumping him up to go into rehab. We have fairly decent benefits which includes drug rehabilitation and holding his job. For 3 days straight all I did was tell him to take advantage of the benefits we have, that's why we have them. We had an impromptu meeting BOH before our shift and we were all very encouraging to him and supportive of his decision to detox. Day before yesterday my managers cousin died from an overdose and it really affected the mood BOH. My manager and my coworker are good friends outside of work as well. So it really made his situation seem more urgent. Well yesterday he came to work kicking real hard. It was good and bad to see at the same time. Good that he was finally trying to quit, bad that he looked like shit and couldn't perform whatsoever. After about 2 hours of him avoiding the line and sitting in the walk in he finally agreed to go to rehab. Our manager called the facility and had him checked in even before he clocked out. In all my years in this industry I have never seen a restaurant staff come together for a coworker dealing with addiction the way I did yesterday. Usually it's discipline then termination. I have to say that I am very impressed and I even got a little teary eyed how no one passed judgement and we all genuinely tried to help and eventually did.

{"title": "So\u2026 owner just told me not to come today.", "selftext": "So I\u2019ve (39M, 15+ years in the kitchen) been working for this little restaurant (16 seats total) that serves the local college students, for about four months. Great little place, I make ramen, yakisobas and combo lunches. I am mostly the only employee, the other person who works there is the owner\u2019s wife and a student who isn\u2019t very reliable but comes in at least 10-15 hours a week to help with my prep. We got along great. The kitchen is small and hot  but clean and somewhat well organized. The owner (who has his own 9-5 job) makes the broths from scratch in his house delivers them to the restaurant in the morning and his wife and I run the shop. \n\nAfter a month of work they gave me a raise, telling me I exceeded their expectations. I kept and ran the kitchen better than they could. I loved it. \n\nBut for some weeks I\u2019d noticed a steady decline on the produce that came in, lower quality stuff, less quantity of produce. Knowing the signs I asked \u201care we in trouble?\u201d  They told me no, not yet. But sales had gone down and we weren\u2019t meeting the goals. I suggested we brought down the portions a bit to try. We did it and it lessened the load. \n\nYesterday I talked to the wife and she told me we were in trouble. I said I could help with pricing out the menu again and re working something so we could spend less money. \n\nBut today he told me this week we won\u2019t open. Yesterday we closed early (like two hours earlier than our closing time) because we ran out of propane. I had told them two weeks ago we were running on our spare tank and I had been running all week without a fryer and was firing  everything on the stove and on a little inversion hot plate I had for steaming dumpling fast. He will meet with the accountant this week to decide but I don\u2019t have many hopes. \n\nI will miss that little sweaty and steamy kitchen. \n\nThank you for reading. Rant over. I just needed to eulogize it. \n\n\n\nUPDATE: Day 2 of unemployment, already sent out 5 applications (3 \u201cfor sure I\u2019ll at least get an interview\u201d; 1 \u201cI\u2019m under qualified but I\u2019m shooting my shot\u201d and 1 \u201cI\u2019m overqualified but you offer health insurance\u201d). \n\nI\u2019m overwhelmed at all the replies of well wishes and condolences. Thank you all. \n\n I forgot to mention one of the little things that I was allowed to do there was put my own music for the kitchen and dinning room (just a small bluetooth boombox). I started our shy, with a top 40 of pop music. But then I looked Japanese covers of english songs, made a japanese ska punk soundtrack, I had japanese dive bar playlist for friday\u2019s happy hour. It was a little aspect I really enjoyed of the job. I never expected to het so into curating the music for a space. Maybe I should pivot DJing.

Said bartender is also getting ready for service and is in the kitchen with me, probably grabbing ice or something. I was bitching up a storm because *all* of my god damned quart containers are gone. I only have like 4 of them! Where did they all go!\n\nShe comments something like, \"Just get more, I don't see the problem.\"\n\nI comment back that I need these things, and that yes it is a problem. We use them for portioning and storing certain food items. They are super important. She again says something along the lines of \"just buy more\".\n\nI'm confused at this point and start going on about how wasting money isn't the solution to this problem. I can't just spend away our profits to replenish something I should get a good amount of use out of. These shouldn't be disappearing, what is going on, someone is stealing these containers, I can't 'just buy more'. I had what I needed and now they are gone. Where are they!\n\n*Then*, I see the wheels start turning... She says something like \"Wait, what? I thought they were single use? Don't they get replenished?\"\n\nExcuse me, what? NO! I reuse these things until they break! I'm not just giving them away. These are not 'to-go' containers!\n\nWhelp, she fesses up. Apparently this whole time, the whole four years we've been at this restaurant together, this sweet as pie bartender has been jacking my quart containers, for whatever, then  just bombing them at home because well, they are single use of course. \n\nBut it gets even better than that. I do the juice and syrups for this bar. And what do I give them their juice and syrup in? You guessed it. Quart containers. You know what they've been doing with them after I supply their prep? Throwing them in the fucking trash!\n\nFFS people. Ugh... Whelp, problem solved I guess.

Food piling up, runners not being able to run things because they (the kitchen) did not have communication about item that take longer than others and know what to do now in time to have everything fresh out, so we have food just sitting or they dont know what is up and ready to run. That said I think we have the potential to. We have a good group that would do well with some structure, something like, pantry telling grill (who sorta runs the order calling, or EC when it gets busy) when a first up is out or working so that we know when to do main courses and so on. \n\nMy question is: How can I quietly introduce open communications to creat efficiency. I don't want to push to many buttons. I have not been there long but I want to help this place to be the best they can be. \n\nI have a social work degree in macro studies....I look at systems and I like to help make them work. \n\nThank you.

Only can order from Sysco Friday 9am, so she didn't come in until 9am on Friday, then yelled at her college-aged line cook for not ordering for her, even though neither of us can recall her instructing her to do that...\n4. Panics every day despite the office building being a ghost town because after COVID, many people became remote workers.\n5. When I ask her to give me a\u00a0***definitive TIME***\u00a0that lunch should be ready, she says 11am, which I interpret as 10:45am... and then she cries when the salad bar isn't out at 9:30am. \n6. Keeps telling me she'd like my input, but when I point out very, very small operational tools that would help with all the panicking and last-minute shopping - like a prep list - she vetoes every idea, even if I volunteer to do them. Why? Because she wants me to spend more time talking to customers and getting to know everyone. Twice so far, food has ran out during lunch period because no one was making food.\n7. Hired me for $15/hr as a cook, but then asked me to make her lunch specials for her and sat me down to brainstorm next week's specials Friday, long after she could order food for them, which probably means another trip to Whole Foods for her.\n8. Encouraged me to take a break after each meal rush, which I considered a decent compromise if 30 minutes can't be done at one time. She also encouraged me to eat more, \"Grits and eggs, that's it? Make whatever you want!\" but I stick to grits or a small salad. After three days, now she's complaining that I'm \"always sitting down\" and always eating. I see now why the college girl doesn't eat anything no matter how much the owner insists.\n9. She can't talk and work at the same time. She asks me about my boyfriend, my family, my siblings, my hometown. I ask her about her website, does she want pictures of her food for social media. Turns out, she doesn't have either of these things, she's just so busy. (This place is dead after 12:30 and we are open until 3:30pm.)

However, before I begin, I have a few questions to help things go more smoothly, and I'll use chicken as an example to simplify things slightly. (I assume it's probably different for certain broths)\n\nBecause I want to go all out and learn as much as possible, I'd like to use four different types of chicken broth. Each question will apply to each broth, and I know that's an absurd number of things to answer, so just answer what you can.\n\nThe four types of broth are:\n\nA. Meat, Bone, Mirepoix  \nB. Meat, Bone  \nC. Bone, Mirepoix  \nD. Bone  \n\n(Let me know if another broth example, such as one with just meat and mirepoix or any others, would provide valuable information.

What parts of the chicken are bad for the broth and should not be added?  \n\n2. Is there an ideal temperature for simmering to ensure the best flavor, and does it vary depending on the stage of the process?  \n\n3. Does the amount of water I use at any stage matter if my end goal is to reduce the broth to a demi-glace?  \n\n4. How long can I push the \"extraction\" of flavors by adding more water? Is there a point where all flavor is extracted from the ingredients, or does it start to turn bitter or bad?  \n\n5. This one is more a matter of opinion, but are there better results if the chicken is cooked or raw? If cooked, what is your favorite cooking method for the best flavor?  \n\n6. This is a bit of a silly question, but would it be different or pointless to make broth from a mixture of cooked and uncooked ingredients?  \n\n7. Is it bad to add charred ingredients, and if not, how much char is too much for a broth?  \n\nThat's all I can muster from my brain right now, but I'll try to come up with more questions in the future.\n\nIf you have any additional information on this topic, PLEASE, please, please tell me because I would be forever grateful.\n\nThanks for entertaining my questions!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kdgqls/how_can_i_make_the_most_superb_broth_i_want_to/", "created_utc": 1746233687.0, "score": 1, "author": "SimplePhilosopher488", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kdgqls/how_can_i_make_the_most_superb_broth_i_want_to/", "html_title": ""}

Our Tariff Task Force has identified products and items that could be impacted by as well as thousands of alternative products to minimize cost increases and supply chain disruptions. Your sales representative can assist in helping you find alternative products when possible.\n\nIn addition, we are making additional changes and updates to our product lists and how we operate to both meet the moment and ensure we provide you with quality products at a good value.\n\nHere are a few things we are implementing to help provide you the best service:\n\n* Identifying product alternatives, including locally grown and locally produced items, to help minimize the impact these tariffs will have on your business and your customers.\n* Creating better internal visibility on product Country of Origin so we can more quickly identify which items require alternatives and provide you with options and relevant information.\n* Daily Tariff Task Force meetings to respond quickly to new developments.\n\nAs the largest food distributor in the world with thousands of suppliers, tens of thousands of products and a global workforce of more than 76,000 people in 10 countries, we are well-positioned to provide solutions. We want to emphasize that as this situation continues to evolve, there remains some uncertainty regarding whether there will be exceptions on specific products or categories. We will continue to closely monitor the situation, update the list of alternatives, and communicate regarding the steps we are taking to minimize disruption to you and your business.\n\nFor items that will be subject to tariffs, those costs will be passed through, so we encourage you to review the list of alternative products designed to minimize cost increases and impacts to your business. Tariff cost increases will not be a separate line item on invoices. We appreciate your continued partnership and trust in Sysco and look forward to helping you and your business succeed.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSysco Corporation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kbjhge/sysco_letter_regarding_tariffs/", "created_utc": 1746027328.0, "score": 67, "author": "Paradigm_Reset", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kbjhge/sysco_letter_regarding_tariffs/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Not sure what to do, need some help", "selftext": "I went to culinary school, did my internship (sorta) loved it, it was casual fine dining and was quite hard especially because it was my first job, the first 3 months were tough I was quite bad and one of the chefs was always on my back, not bullying more so he was pushing me to make me better and I knew that. Still, it was tough being told off every day. \n\nThat chef left, I stayed part time and loved it. A new chef came in, Je was great and felt more like a mate than my boss. However, my skill did suffer. Eventually that chef got really sick of the other staff and kinda turned sour on everyone, so made it a bit shit for a while but I always looked forward to going into work. \n\nThen, the restaurant closed. Quite suddenly, and I found myswlf without a job but I decided to stay unemployed until I finished college in 6 months. I finished college and the tough chef from before called me, he was the head chef of a Michelin recommended place and needed staff. \n\nSo, I found a temporary place to stay, started the job, did well on my first day I fit into their service quite well and that was it. Then I started the following week, I hated the whole day, I wasn't fast enough and I was messing up, I was anxious because of this and completely thrown off, I had gone back to before where he was mocking me for getting stressed and little things. The pressure really got to me and I decided not to come back in. It was definitely a temporary solution to the problem. I moved back home and said I was done being in kitchens, I couldn't handle it. I thought of this as an opportunity to get out and try new things. Then, a few months later I ended up trialing in a few places, the same standard as the place I had left. Just in case it was just an issue with the chef and not the actual job as a whole. \n\nI found the perfect job that said they'd love to have me, they were committed to training me up and genuinely felt like they wanted me there. The chef had worked around 2/3 star places so I knew he would be good to learn from. But the day before I was meant to start he calls me saying he was let go, and the new chef that was coming in didmt need anybody so I was out of a job. I was distraught.\n\nI'm still at home and ended up getting a local pizza job aswell as a minimum wage job in a shop bakery but I feel like a bum. After working for better money, with more responsibility, good produce, coming up with menus, learning every day and working to a good standard I feel like I've just gone so backward. I'm making videos on the side and that keeps me sane but I just don't feel like I'm doing enough. \n\nI also feel like I don't want to work in a kitchen but I'm really not sure. Is it worth the hours and pain? Am I thinking too much into the future? I'm afraid I'll get stuck and not be able to pursue other things. I love working with food but that chef has really gotten in my head and I feel like I have some sort of PTSD reaction when I get into a new kitchen, it's really weird, I'm not even bothered by shouting but the pressure I feel during prep especially just makes me numb. I've also developed a chronic pain that I believe is a result of the stress. \n\nIf I'm not going to pursue cheffing, what else can I do ? I like making videos and everything else to do with food but I feel like such a fraud because I haven't worked that long in kitchens.

{"title": "Same old story", "selftext": "To start, I'm not a chef coat or a trained chef or anything. I've worked in a lot of kitchens, Pizza, Italian, wings, bars, tacos. I'm just a well seasoned cook, pun intended. I've been in management as well a couple of times. This is more of a \"Who can relate? Any advice\" post\n\nThe place I'm at right now, I love. I've never worked in a kitchen like this, it's super free, we kick ass, we make awesome food, no uniforms, no one breathing down our necks, no camera jockies. We are probably the most popular spot in our city.\n\nEverywhere I have worked, the story is always the same. There is this neverending quarrel between AM and PM. Granted our guys can work both sometimes, but for the most part the same people work specific shifts. We are all really good friends and get along very well and work well together.\n\nWe have a few issues in our kitchen but the one that's the most frequent is Morning crew always has some complaint, against the way night crew closed. We either did something, didn't do something, forgot something, didnt clean something or whatever. From time to time there is a real issue like someone leaving the fryers on but for the most part it's trivial nonsense.\n\nOver the 3 years I have been here I have tried to tighten up wherever someone had a complaint about the way I close, I might get butthurt but I try to improve.\n\nThe big issue lately has been two openers complain that the line didn't get stocked, or someone didnt wash a dish or something. I don't keep score, if I come in and the line isn't stocked I just get it done (the other main night guy feels the same way) I come in and there's no cheese, no steak, no rice, no one stocked the cold line, no tortillas so on and so on. And I'm not telling myself \"OOOOh I'm gonna have a talk with them tomorrow, oooooo this feels personal, they suck at their job.\" Nah, it's like it never happened. I want things to be right. However we know to stock the line for the morning it's important to do that and if it isn't getting done, then it's a problem.\n\nBut I find myself paranoid everyday I come in to close of what complaint the AM guys are going to pull me aside to discuss as if it the end of the world. To clarify it's our aim to leave everything buttoned up and clean and stocked but you can't babysit everyone all the time. The newer guy I'm closing with already has the line covered and I assume, knowing he knows what's expected, that he did his job.\n\nRecently the AM guy gets me alone on a Sunday and starts talking about how the line wasn't stocked right and it's a real issue for him, it feels like and I quote \"A personal attack.\" and someone found a queso pan uncleaned under the cutting board drying on the sink and we cant be leaving dishes unwashed. He goes on and on, the other AM guy (we're all good friends btw) chimes in and you can tell they have been talking about this all day.\n\nThe entire time this conversation is happening I am standing in front of a load of AM prep dishes that aren't cleaned and these two have already clocked out. And not just a few either, I'm talking pans, pots, cambros, sieves you name it. They aren't planning on doing them either. At the same time, I know that the line isn't stocked for night crew...in fact I could have accurately predicted which items weren't stocked because they never are. And this pile of dishes would make me upset if it weren't ALWAYS the case, like it is every Sunday. Likewise when I come in I know not only will there be dishes in some form unfinished, and a line that needs attention, I know I will find someone bent over the line on their phone, or standing near or behind the bar. Which, only exacerbates my frustration.\n\nI'm a lazy SOB sometimes too, I'm not perfect, if I make a mistake I do my best to own it and not get an ego. But I don't keep score, I try not to, it will take me less than 10 minutes to remedy the line not being restocked and someone can take some initiative to do the dishes. As frequent as an issue might be for AM when they come in, its likely 3 times more frequent for night crew, and AM wouldn't hear about it because we're just gonna get it done and move on. Even though it's important for us to have everything ready to go at night because were in the middle of the work day right before dinner rush and you can argue, despite a prep list, AM has 3 hours to deal with something before hand. Still we try to close to open and the favor should be returned.\n\nAt the end of my day I have to make sure they have what they need for the morning and then still have an hour of cleaning to do, these dudes just have to wait to see our faces walk through the door and then they get to crack a beer, all the time in the world to clean up their mess and do what needs to be done.\n\nI love these guy with all my heart, as one of them says, and I agree \"We're all C#$ts\" we all make mistakes and we all do or don't do something that pisses someone else off.\n\nWe also have a daily checklist and temp log for every shift to assure accountability, the other main night guy and I were looking at it last night.....every night time shift is filled out and every temp accounted for, take a wild guess what AM looked like.\n\nThat being said, you have a checklist signed with the initials of who did what. If something wasn't done then you know who didn't do it. Talk to that guy. When I and the other main night guy close together we've been told our closes are beautiful. I even suggested \"Then I'll start checking everyones work.\" AM responded \"You don't have to do that...\" Ok so if it's not my problem why are we talking about it? The more these conversations happen the more irritable I am when they happen and I hate being short with friends. I'm afraid I sound like someone who can't take criticism and don't know how to deal with it. Is it me? I have to ask, do we just suck as a crew or should someone else maybe not be so critical?\n\nI just don't understand being able to complain about things not being done while a literal pile of \"What needs to be done.\" is right over my shoulder staring you in the face and that's not even the first time that's happened. That conversation with the pile of dishes ended 20 minutes later with me doing the dishes and one of the AM guys come into dishpit and says \"Yeah man I'm sorry we didn't do the dishes dude, I really am.\" Ok, why am I doing them? Put your beer down and do these dishes or next time there's something to complain about just keep it to yourself. If you're gonna complain make sure your actually doing what your complaining that others aren't doing. You don't get to not do your job and complain when you think someone else isn't doing theirs.\n\nThere was even a day when there was a pile of AM dishes and I asked the Mid guy, \"They left these dishes?\" and he said \"Yeah, he said not to do them because something about last nights close.\" I would never do something on purpose to spite another crew member because of a mistake they made. Also, you're leaving work undone ON PURPOSE because of something ACCIDENTAL and Lord knows how many times they left things the way they did intentionally. That's never ok. What they didn't know was that we had a guest bartender on the patio and he left things in the dishpit after we clocked out, he didnt know he had to them himself. \n\nLately I have been vocal like \"OK, if you're keeping score I'll start keeping score too. Here's what you did wrong yesterday.\" When PM makes a mistake its \"You guys need to do better, it feels like a personal attack.\" When AM makes a mistake its \"WE, are a team and WE need to improve. WE need a kitchen meeting.\" Not necessarily \"YOU need to do your job better especially if YOU are going to be so critical about everything.\"\n\nThere's a big difference between Mistakes and Patterns. There's a big difference between accidental and on purpose.\n\nYou might ask \"What does the kitchen manager have to say about all of this.\" I will tell you that is whole other story for another time.\n\nIn case you guys see this, I love you, I love working there I just needed to get this out.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kb4r51/same_old_story/", "created_utc": 1745976826.0, "score": 9, "author": "Capnmcquacken", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1kb4r51/same_old_story/", "html_title": ""}

He was pushing, I was guiding in the front and helping lift over the lip. \n\nWELLLLLLL, the lip came up faster than he realized, and he had it tipped forward just a bit too much and the inertia of the (inadequate) transporting containers was enough to slide them forward and tip the wheel barrow cart forward. Lukewarm oil all over my pants, in my shoes, and spreading entirely throughout this 25' hallway (the only exit in and out of the building). \n\n\nAround this time as the clattering and \"oh fuuuuuuccccckkkksss\" subsided, who else but Chef and the sous come rounding the corner, ready to smoke a cigarette after a raging Sunday night service. I'll never forget Chef's face as he calmly put the (unlit) cigarette back in the pack from his lips and tucked it in his shirt pocket. \"You boys better get this place spotless so I can have a cigarette .. and don't you dare let it go out that door; if it makes it into the bay, it could be a huge fine for the restaurant.\"\n\nHe was ice cold, but calm and collected, and it was my most magnificent fuck up.\n\n\nIt took us like 10 broken down cardboard boxes as makeshift dust pans and the squeegee to get the oil back into the pots, this time after we got it over the lip, and not a drop made it out of the door.\n\nThankfully, we didn't lose our jobs. \"Mistakes happen... Once\" - the wise words of Chef. \n\nThat next Sunday, a shiny brand new shuttle was waiting for us in the dry storage.

{"title": "Advice?", "selftext": "Hey guys, Im an 18 year old aspiring chef. I worked as a pot wash for 2 years before leaving in December \u201824. The place was horrific, dishwasher that hardly ever worked, pipes thst were taped and when they burst it was our fault. The chefs were terrible human beings too, verbally abusing the pot washers and sometimes physically assaulting us too. My sous chef threw a plate at me once and that was my breaking point so i did what any normal person would do.\n\nThrow a chopping board and a cheesecake at him and storm out.\n\nThe head chef tried to talk me back into working there again but i told him to piss off. But that wasn\u2019t the last time he asked, repeatedly he asks me to come back because his current kp\u2019s don\u2019t share a brain cell between the 4 of them.\n\nThis job was shit, barely making minimum wage for a shit job, it\u2019d come to pay day and you\u2019d remember the hard graft you had the month prior then i\u2019d think \u201cfucking hell is that all i\u2019ve made?\u201d\n\nAfter leaving I took a break for a few months just focused on college, passing my exams and just living life. I didn\u2019t realise how miserable i was when at work and how much i was missing out on.\n\nAfter a couple months i went for a job interview as a chef at an entertainment bar in my town, i got the job and on my first shift i did nothing bar watch the first England game with the new manager. It was boring.\n\nA month on i\u2019m still there but it\u2019s shit, theres never anything to do and when i try to do something that\u2019d help me in the kitchen i get in the shit for it.\n\nWith the current head chef out for a few months from surgery it leaves me in charge. Slight issue, the head chef is shit and didnt tell me how to do any of the deep cleaning jobs. All i have to go by is a sheet of paper that says \u201cgrease trap\u201d or \u201cextraction filters\u201d Which ain\u2019t much of a help \ud83d\ude44.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the industry 2 years and i fucking hate it, im burnt out, im miserable and just hate the thought of stepping foot in a kitchen. but i know if i dont be a chef i\u2019ll be miserable.\n\nI hate missing out on things because i have to work, I felt so miserable i didn\u2019t want to see anybody on my days off. When i wasnt at work i just wanted to sleep all day and do nothing. It affected my relationship, it affected friendships. It affected my mental health to no end. How do people cope? If i stay in this industry i don\u2019t see myself living past 21. Has anyone got any advice on how to live as a chef because fuck me im struggling right now.\n\nThanks\n\n(This is my OP but i posted it in another subreddit before posting on this one.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k9icd9/advice/", "created_utc": 1745798765.0, "score": 7, "author": "Adhjbrhvd", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k9icd9/advice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Together, we\u2019re raising an amazing family \u2014 two stepkids (13 and 11), my nephew (13) whom I\u2019m now the legal guardian of, and our 3-year-old son.\n\nNot too long ago, my wife sat me down and gave me the kind of talk that changes your life.

My boys and I run a little drink/lemonade business primarily at our local farmers market, but we also do an occasional collaboration with a good friend at her pie shop making shakes, each with a whole slice of one of her pies in it. \n\nHistorically these events have been pretty wild. I have two blenders and can make two shakes in each at a time. If there\u2019s any downtime, I blend up a two shakes in each blender cup and stick em in the freezer, reblending for a few seconds when the next order comes in, but those moments of downtime are rare. \n\nThis next one though, is on Mother\u2019s Day weekend and we\u2019re one of the scheduled stops for several rounds of bus tours. Each bus has about 50 people on it and they have a schedule to follow so even if only 15-20 of them want shakes, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get them all done before they need to go to the next stop. \n\nSo I need some advice. Part of the allure of the pie shake is that you get to see a whole slice of pie go into the blender, but I need to figure out something prep-wise. What would you brilliant people do? I have plenty of freezer space and thought about doing a bunch before we open and storing them in Cambros to re-mix on order, but I worry about those freezing into a block and being difficult. \n\nAny advice you have would be so incredibly appreciated!\n\nEdited to add: we\u2019re only doing one flavor for shakes so any prep can be universal.

{"title": "Working as a spus chef in a Michelin rated restaurant", "selftext": "After being a head chef in the summer I decided to settle down. I was sending my CV to every office job I could find for 6 months with no success. Eventually I gave up and went back to the kitchen. Found a cozy place with it being rated a Michelin plaque already. Colleagues told me to go for it - why not?\n\nHead chef over there has a birth defected left arm. However, he works the hell out of it. I am a person who learns to respect otgers through the work ethics - and he FUCKING CRUSHES EVERYBODY. I decided to work for him.\n\nThe place - an open kitchen steakhouse with always burning charcoal fire. Order sides seperatelly with tataki or ceviche starters kinda place.\n\nPrep guy - Jacob. A kind of \"my job is to know everything\" kinda guy. I love him. Pity he leaves us in a couple of weeks. Works from 8am to 5pm. In charge of prep, pastry and all sorts of inside politics. \n\nFor the first month I worked with him. I outworked him. Came in earlier, stayed longer, helped though all the rushes. I even outbested him in his section, while he had 4 more years of experience in fine dining than I do.\n\nCold sectiod - Davey. A hard nut to crack. He has experience as a head chef and will go to seaside in couple of weeks. There is a hate-love relationship with us, but he taught me how to work around everyone.\n\nTo be honest, we had our fights on how to conduct this kitchen. Therefore, throught every service I saw him appreciate me more every day. Last service (this Friday) was a revalation when he publicly defended me when I made a mistake. Cool guy after all.\n\nThe other SousChef - Rytis. A fucking cunt. I met him twice or thrice but he became my best friend. We had an outspoken bond of \"make as much prep as you can for the other person\" kind. Today was his Brunch shift and I did as much prep as I could have done for him - from cooking beef cheeks for him, to packing hollandaise sauces seperatelly and preping the bread mix. He's a cunt because he leaves in a week.\n\nWhat I learned so far? Polish delivery services bring your goods quicker if you speak Polish. Lithuanians are very adapt to gendet jokes (also delivery drivers). Orders - everything is too much and something is not enough. That is a difficult part from my last chef gig (also in here). \nSome of our recipes are stolen from local niche sushi places. Nevertheless, I have no originality myself so I can't be mad. This is a second place with that much technicality I have seen. But it's the easiest money I ever gained. I am perpetually tired, but I am happy. \n\nI am saving for an engagement ring and a new car, considering we just bought our first apartment. Things are going well. Eill notify if anything changes.\nLove you guys and have a good service!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k8qhv4/working_as_a_spus_chef_in_a_michelin_rated/", "created_utc": 1745711068.0, "score": 4, "author": "ToddaS8", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k8qhv4/working_as_a_spus_chef_in_a_michelin_rated/", "html_title": ""}

Then Thursday night I ended up being cut early and apparently right after that he went all out and had to receive narcan 3 times to bring him back.  Cops and EMS in the store.  They found a good amount of fentanyl on him but the cops didn\u2019t arrest due to a law protecting those in active overdose.  So they took him to the hospital where he has since disappeared from.  \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if they had to give him narcan Monday and Tuesday or if they just helped him pull it together and close the store.

Idiot managers deliver me 30 catering events with 17 minutes notice.  Wife gives me permission to quit on the spot.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCast of Characters:\n\nMe: me \n\nCD: Catering Director\n\nCM: Catering Manager\n\nCA: Catering Assistant\u2014college kid, server turned office helper\n\nOC: Original Chef, retired by CD\n\nNC: New Chef\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI worked in Institutional Catering at the time, for a public university in a major American metropolitan area. Our events ranged from sandwiches and chips (crisps) for 4 to black-tie sports banquet fundraisers for 300 and everything in between.\n\nWhen I was hired as Sous Chef 18+ months earlier, the CD (CM at the time) told me that I was selected because of my extensive background in higher end catering, something that the OC didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with and struggled with (he had taken the position years earlier because he was nearing retirement, and our sunny, subtropical region was attractive to retirees). She informed me that he was retiring soon, and that I would be promoted to his position when that happened.\n\nHe retired within two months, but had accrued eight weeks of vacation that had to be used prior to official retirement, so for eight weeks I had the job FUNCTIONS, but no promotion (authority, hours and money). Job functions that were essential to being the Chef yet restricted to salaried personnel (planning meetings where details of upcoming events were hammered out weeks in advance, for instance) were being handled by our newly minted CM, someone who has worked with our CD previously and transferred in to help her out. His policy was \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you need to know,\u201d a policy as effective in practice as a Kindergarten game of Telephone.  Perhaps this is why, in their wisdom, Corporate required the head of the kitchen to actually have that authority and attend those meetings, ya think?\n\nAt the end of eight weeks, another Chef in the kitchen was leaving too, so Corporate wanted to review a possible reorganization of the kitchen staff while positions were vacant before refilling them\u2026.. another two months.\n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nSix months in, they add another Sous to the kitchen (mine I\u2019m told, when the paperwork finally goes through), and after two more months he admits that they hired him to audition for Chef, but he\u2019s beginning to believe that\u2019s not ever happening, so he bounced.  Now I\u2019m once again the only skilled person left in the kitchen, and they\u2019re obviously never making good on the job offer. For over a year they strung me along, always dangling the prospect of promotion, all the while I\u2019m doing the work of a salaried Chef at the hourly rate of a Sous.\n\nEventually, CD got a call from Corporate informing her that there was a corporate Chef transferring into our area that needed a position, and since they had \u201chad so much trouble finding someone to fill their Catering Chef position\u201d, he was being assigned there. According to CM/CD, they tried to put me there (a year too late) but Corporate overruled them because they needed a spot for incoming Chef.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSimultaneous to the personnel issues, there were three institutional catering companies in our area that vied for the contracts of the two major universities and three sports arenas. Whenever one\u2019s contract was up for renewal, the others would attempt to poach the account away from them. I mention this because we had just finished a year of trying to steal the other university away, and we were now six months into a year of them attempting to steal OUR contract away.\n\nThe competitor that ran the other university had been particularly aggressive this time, and had actually handled 1-2 minor independent events on campus (alumni, so not bound by our contract) and the Catering Office was particularly nervous about these. As a result of this, CD came up with a policy directive designed to stave off the wolves:\n\n*We would never say \u201cNo\u201d.  Ever.*\n\n[here, I pause for the collective groan of you all who know that this NEVER ends well]\n\nAt first, this was a minor inconvenience, with the occasional odd dish requests or last minute quantity changes. But, as time passed, the university staff began to realize the new policy (or our staff was dumb enough to tell them outright) and everything went out the window. Gone were 72-hour deadlines for menu finalization, no more upcharges for increasing party sizes at the last minute and \u201cpop-up\u201d events became the norm instead of the exception.\n\nWe now had clients bringing us photos (not even menus) out of Martha Stewart Living of tiny intimate dinners for four, and expecting us to replicate that for an off-site, plated banquet dinner for 75\u2026..and then changing it to 85 upon arrival.\n\nWe had clients calling to ask if it was \u201cat all possible\u201d to provide a buffet breakfast for 80, tomorrow, only to be met with a banner announcing the \u201c3rd Annual Conference of Whosawhatchits\u201d hanging above our tables the next day. \u201cAnnual\u201d means you\u2019ve been planning this for a YEAR\u2026.\n\nAnyhow, that\u2019s the background story of my work attitude at the time, a hitherto unmentioned yet relevant character in this tale as well.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSo, for six weekends a year, our regular catering duties also included football games.\n\nOur campus included its own stadium for football (both American and the other kind) and for home games we catered the entire stadium on game days\u2014this consisted of 25+ private skybox viewing rooms, press box, and occasionally a coaches\u2019 area. All of these rooms had a three page menu to choose from to fill 16\u2019 of banquet table. This meant that, while the choices were more limited than our usual selections, every room was configured differently and contained differing food combinations. It was essentially 25 small events going off at exactly the same time.\n\n[Anyone with three brain cells rubbing together should realize that\u2019s a very difficult proposition on a good day. But, we know this wasn\u2019t a good day, don\u2019t we\u2026..?]\n\nWe used to have a hard deadline of end of business day on Tuesday for football skybox orders. This was because we needed Wednesday morning to turn 25 separate event orders into a single shopping list\u2014Wednesday orders had to be placed by 3pm, were received on Thursday, prepped Thursday and Friday, cooked Saturday and delivered to the stadium by no later than 6pm Saturday\u2014Game Day. It was a schedule that was tight, but allowed for minor updates, missing ingredients and adequate prep time so that Saturday was JUST a cooking and delivery day.\n\nBut now, because of our \u201cJust don\u2019t say no\u201d policy, football days had become an increasing nightmare all year. We now had skybox orders dribbling in all week long, up to and including Saturday morning. I eventually just guesstimated what we would need based on previous events and placed the Wednesday order. Frequently I was driving to our wholesaler in my own car to pick up items needed after the order was placed, and just as frequently I had to answer \u201cwhy do we have so much XXXXXX left over in the cooler?\u201d after a game.\n\nHowever, on this crisp October week (well, hot humid and muggy actually), this was no ordinary football game.\n\nThis.\nIs.\nHOMECOMING!\n\nHomecoming is a tradition (IDK it\u2019s origins, so I explain for all) where a college holds a week of events attended by current students and alumni celebrating the history of the school. There are dances, homecoming courts (kings and queens crowned), etc. It\u2019s a big deal in collegiate life.  It\u2019s also a week where the typical college football game isn\u2019t played on Saturday like the rest. Homecoming games are Thursday. This means that our usual ordering and preparation schedule runs Monday to Thursday, not Wednesday to Saturday.\n\nWhen I left work the Friday before, I checked on the status of football orders, knowing that none of the people ordering would be on campus over the weekend. We had 6\u2026. out of 25. I pressed the office staff about when we would be getting the rest, because I would have to start working on them when I walked in on Monday. I was told that the deadline was Friday 5pm, but I also had no faith that any of our clients would be honoring that.\n\nSure enough, Monday morning yields SEVEN BEOs (banquet event orders, the lifeblood of catering) out of an expected 25, so I set off on my usual \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d process. Three days and several trips to the wholesaler later, all the prep is done, most of the event orders are in my possession and prep is all but completed. Thursday morning comes, and we embark on the task of firing all the food, assembling it into multiple hot boxes, cold racks, and storage racks (room temp items like chips, bread, etc.) all sorted by room number for easy delivery (if three fully loaded trips of a box van across campus can truly be called \u2018easy\u2019).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAt 2:40pm\u2026.\n\n[but\u2026.. this was eleven years ago. How could you POSSIBLY know exactly what time it was?]\n\nCA walks into the chaos of the kitchen and stands at the end of the counter trying to get my attention. Looking her way, I notice she is holding a stack of BEOs.\n\nMe: \u201cI already have today\u2019s BEOs\u2026.\u201d [gesturing to the 25 sheets taped along my counter where I\u2019m checking off items as they\u2019re completed, sorted, stored and wrapped]\nCA: \u201cThese aren\u2019t today\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\nMe: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have time for next week\u2019s right now. Just put them in my box and I\u2019ll look at them later.\u201d\nCA: [looks panicked] \u201cUmmm\u2026.. they\u2019re not next week\u2019s.\u201d\n\nI peel off my gloves and take the papers from her. The top of the first order shows the event location as Skybox #1\u2026 the next, Skybox #2\u2026. I count the orders\u201430. THIRTY?!? We don\u2019t have that many skyboxes\u2026. The last five are labeled \u201cGreen Room\u201d\u2026.? And they are all dated for Saturday.\n\nAs I mentioned, Homecoming centers around many events, and this particular week included a night of concerts at the football stadium on Saturday. Someone\u2014to this day I don\u2019t know whether that was campus staff or catering staff\u2014decided to sell the skyboxes for the concerts AND agree to provide food for all the bands too\u2026..and they didn\u2019t mention it to the kitchen until 2:40pm on Thursday.\n\nMe: [finally looking up at CA] FIND. ME. CHEF.\n\nUp until now, I\u2019ve not mentioned Chef (NC, the new chef foisted upon us by corporate) because\u2026. Well, he wasn\u2019t present. For any of it. Not the cooking, the preparation, the ordering, ANY of it.\n\nYou see, NC was what we call in the profession \u201cuseless\u201d.\n\nHis idea of being Chef was to have me continue to do all the things I\u2019ve been doing for over a year, and just show up in a nice clean coat at the events and shake people\u2019s hands and take credit for the food. His idea of writing menus was to copy the names of recipes out of cookbooks (not commercial ones, the ones you get at Barnes & Noble) and then promptly forget where he got it, forcing me to write recipes from scratch for all of his \u201capproved menus\u201d. He didn\u2019t know how to order, which was fine since he didn\u2019t DO it either\u2014he delegated that to me. He was also a disciple of CM\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you what you need to know\u201d school, executing it just as flawlessly as CM.\n\nChef entered the kitchen within minutes.\n\n\nNC: \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nMe: [handing NC Saturday BEOs] \u201cHave you seen THESE?\u201d\nNC: \u201cYes, I know about them.\u201d\nMe: \u201cHave they been ordered already?\u201d\nNC: \u201cWell, no. You can do that\u2026.\u201d\nMe: \u201c\u2026.WHEN? Order cutoff is in [glances at the clock] SEVENTEEN MINUTES!!!\u201d\nNC: \u201cYou can order them tomorrow, right?\u201d\nMe: [fighting off an aneurysm] \u201cTomorrow\u2019s orders arrive MONDAY. These are for Saturday\u2026..\u201d\nNC: \u201cOh\u2026\u2026. Well, go do them now.\u201d\nMe: [looks around at the chaos happening trying to get food out the door]. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve got this?\u201d\nNC: \u201cYou\u2019ve already given everyone instructions, right? I can watch it til you get back.\u201d\nMe: [starting out the door, riffling through the orders]. \u201cChef, this order\u2026.. no, ALL the green room orders don\u2019t have menus.

Two are hot food buffets that just say, \u201ctwo entrees, two sides\u201d.\u201d\nNC: [huffs]. \u201cJust feed those two the same thing. It\u2019s not that hard\u2026..\u201d\nMe: \u201cExcept that one green room has multiple ALLERGIES listed and this one is VEGAN!!!\u201d\nNC: [waves dismissively]. \u201cJust get it done.\u201d\n\n\nI walk (storm? probably) out of the kitchen and into the Catering Office to use the computer. CA and CM attempt futilely not to make eye contact.\n\nI don\u2019t even attempt to break down the BEOs into an actual prep list, because there\u2019s no time. Glancing at the skybox orders they seem to be close to the football orders, so I just pull up Monday\u2019s order and resend it again. Between that and whatever we have left from today\u2019s football, I hope we\u2019ll have what we need.\n\nI walk back to the kitchen where NC is watching people work. I set the BEOs on my counter and before NC can say a word announce that I need a smoke break and walk out onto the loading dock. (I don\u2019t smoke, but all of the managers do, so by phrasing it that way, they never call me out on it).\n\nOn the dock, I call my wife. I just need something to calm me down. I regale her with the tale, in full orchestration and five-part harmony, leaving nothing out. When I\u2019m done there\u2019s silence for a good ten seconds\u2026.\n\nWife: \u201cSo, you quit, right?\u201d\nMe: \u201cWhu\u2026 what?\u201d\nWife: \u201cYou quit? Because that\u2019s some BULLSHIT.\u201d\n\n[Ladies and gentlemen\u2014my wife of six months, who married me (at least in small part) for the insurance we got through this nightmare employer, and who was five months post cardiac surgery, gave me permission to quit ON THE SPOT, with a \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out tomorrow\u201d before she hung up. \n\nI hope you all find a person like that in your life\u2026..]\n\nI walked back into the kitchen and picked up my apron from next to Chef.\n\nMe: \u201cBy the way, as soon as this event is over, I quit.\u201d\nNC: \u201cYeah, sure\u2026. Good one.\u201d\n\nAfter I fixed the three things that had been done wrong under NC\u2019s watchful eye, I wrangled my cats back into order and got everything finalized. Boxes full. Racks sorted. Trucks loaded. And away we went.\n\nThe entire time I was setting up the rooms at the stadium, my phone is chiming with texts from my wife\u2014job postings that she had found online [did I mention how much I love this woman?]. At 6pm, the entire setup is done\u2014all of the food in place, backups stashed, front of the house is now in charge and my work is done.\n\nI walked back to the kitchen and up to Chef. I slowly unbuttoned my jacket and handed it to him, picked up my knife kit and walked out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k6dcmh/the_day_i_left/", "created_utc": 1745449996.0, "score": 30, "author": "CaptMalcolm0514", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1k6dcmh/the_day_i_left/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "A confessional", "selftext": "In 2021 I was cooking full time at a gimmicky sit down chain restaurant. I liked the work, I was good enough at it. As kitchens do, we had pretty high turnover, and we were also pretty high a lot of the time. Some of us were just plain stupid too. \n\nMy buddy Dimwit and I were mopping up around close. Chef was off that day, and Crypto Bro was second. Crypto was running around checking stations, trying to get us home asap. Someone, I don\u2019t remember who, had been catching up on sauces. We had made something like 50 gallons of a sauce that takes hours to make. Between mixing, cooking, and cooling, it was probably a 4 hour project, costing several hundred to a thousand dollars in ingredients. \n\nObviously the place to leave the cambros full of this sauce while it cooled enough to go in the walk-in was on the floor. Uncovered, not elevated in any kind of way. Simply separated from the tile by 3-5mm of clear plastic, and a prayer. \n\nI remember turning over my left shoulder to find Dimwit standing with the mop in two hands, parallel to the floor. The business end was hanging over the uncovered cambros, and I watched as the ripples of mop water on the surface of the sauce slowly spread. I yelled, pointed, and as he looked over and realized what he\u2019d done, he jerked the mop back, flinging more dirty mop water into the cambros full of fresh sauce. \n\nCrypto, may he be damned to hell, saw this and let out the sigh of someone who has seen too many kids fuck up this kitchen. He then took a small cup, took a couple of scoops of sauce out of the cambro, and put that shit in the walk in. \n\nI, to my everlasting shame, did not do enough. I merely witnessed and stood by as this disaster occurred in front of me. We served that sauce. I should have dumped it on the floor or thrown it out or told Chef the next day or all of the above, but instead I did nothing. \n\nI have since left the industry, but I cannot and will not ever forget this night.

We got a couple new guys that actually had good potential and slowly we were raising the bar. \n\nI had asked for a raise at 6 months in, and was denied. \n\nAt 8 months I asked again, because we were running a skeleton crew and I was doing the work of at least two people, working 6 days a week. \n\nWe recently got a new guy, I trained him, and was happy with how fast he was learning and gaining even more confidence in our new team I felt I was playing a big role in forging. \n\nI learned that he asked for a raise shortly after being hired because he realized how much work it was, and was approved.

This isn\u2019t a mom and pop shop, this is a large company, and our volume absolutely can support this. \n\nAfter her giving me the run around, and explaining why it wasn\u2019t going to happen, I told her that that was unfortunate, stood up, shook her hand, wished them luck, and walked back to the kitchen. \n\nI had told chef that I was going to ask for a raise on Friday and he agreed with my move, acknowledging the hard work I put in. So I went to tell him sorry, but it was denied so I am walking. \n\nI felt like it was a slap in the face to not raise me even .50c in the year I had been there considering all the extra bullshit that came along with the job, and when I learned that the new guy got a bump and I hadn\u2019t received one it was indicative of their disrespect for my efforts and I had to walk on principle.

I end up eating it all on tortilla chips or by the spoon full before I can grab some fresh Arctic char to serve it on! It's so simple! I just hack up some loquats and a little bit of tomato into cubes. Then I add red onion, jalapeno, cilantro stems, microplane some garlic, a good squeeze of lemon or lime, salt and pepper... It's divine! \n\nI ALSO like to make CHICKEN SALAD with loquats. Essentially I use the same pallet as the salsa but add more garlic, maybe some dill, and my preferred chicken salad has a nice blend of around 3/4 mayo, 1/4 Greek yogurt, and some evoo to smooth it out! I'll skip the tomato most of the time. But I go wild with the chicken salad and will just totally clean out the fridge.

We were a tight, hardworking team with most of us having been there at least a couple years.

Sometimes we'd play pranks like making a \"molten cake\" out of used coffee grinds or a \"scoop of ice cream\" made of butter, and laugh as a server unknowingly took a bite. \n\nOne day, the KM went to the grocery store for a few personal purchases, one being canned cat food. Well, our cherished KM and assistant KM thought it would be funny to put some of the cat food on some nachos and give it to the servers. \n\nSure enough, a female server quickly approached and started nibbling away, and as quite a few people were in on the joke, a small crowd started to watch. Eventually, the KM started \"meowing\" at the server. That caught her attention, and she looked around to notice the crowd. Finally someone spilled the beans, and everyone burst into laughter. She went pale, and then her face distorted in anger. She grabbed the nearest steak knife and threw it through the expo window at the KM, and stormed out the restaurant.\n\nShe never came back, threatening to sue. Three days later, the GM was forced to fire the KM and assistant KM.\n\nMoral of the story, don't fuck with peoples food.

They only got fixed after I sent a passive aggressive video to the entire management team. \n\nThe basement (where all the food storage is) flooded with sewage water.

Needless to say that the entire concept of having a dish pit where plates are sunk into hot water and then just rinsed off before going in the machine is obviously impossible to implement. Grab plate, sponge, sponge, sponge, rinse the plate, rinse the sponge, repeat ad nauseam. \n\nAnyway it's not a huge deal, but it sets us back about 20-30 minutes when closing and in reality my boss could save up money by not having a dedicated dishwasher for the weekends when it's packed...if only he'd fix the fucking boiler. He's probably spent over 1k on a dedicated weekend dishwasher instead of 100\u20ac to fix the boiler.

{"title": "Did I do the right thing?", "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom. \n\nI went out to dinner with my six-year-old son while my wife was sick last night, we were at a ~~nice~~ ok local restaurant that\u2019s been there for a couple years but historically has changed names two or three times just in the six years that we\u2019ve been here. We requested to sit in the outdoor seating area, which is right next to a lake.\n\nI noticed that there was a bunch of the restaurants debris/trash, i.e. cardboard, boxes, bottles, plastic containers, etc. that were all overflowing from where they keep their trash and about to be blown into the lake.  There was a woman who kept walking back-and-forth around the outdoor seating area, who clearly was giving off the air of manager so the next time she walked by my table I politely asked if she was the manager she said \u201cyes\u201d. \n\nWith my hands I gestured over towards all the litter and said \u201cHey just so you guys know I noticed that there\u2019s a lot stuff over there that\u2019s about to go into the lake. We work really hard as a community to keep this lake clean and I just wanted to make sure you guys saw it before it was too late.\u201d  \n\nShe responded by saying, \u201cStuff, what stuff?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cuhh, the trash and cardboard boxes\u201d.\n\nI was then met with major agitation \u201cOh yeah, the trash, I know. I\u2019m the night manager, I let the other manager know about it and it appears they didn\u2019t do anything.  I got a list of things that are a mile long to do and can\u2019t do everything\u201d. \n\nI tried to reassure her that I was just trying to start up a dialogue around it to ensure that it got picked up and that I didn\u2019t think anybody was doing anything wrong or malicious. I also let her know. I\u2019m no stranger too long list of tasks at work!  I feel we parted ways in a cordial manner, and I had hoped that I didn\u2019t give her a negative impression of myself for simply calling it out. \n\nWell, we were there for about another 90 minutes and it did not get picked up.\n\nI live on part of the lake (it\u2019s not what it seems, it\u2019s more of a run off containment area for the 4 lane divided highway that\u2019s close by, that\u2019s only 1-2 feet deep and desperately needs to be dredged).  All the negative aside it\u2019s special to me and we that works very hard to keep the lake clean and litter free. My neighborhood routinely organizes cleanup days which my family participates in, etc. I was really super bummed to see a locally owned restaurant so nonchalantly letting their trash flow over into the lake.\n\nI thought I took a very gentle approach by just speaking to them about it, rather than going to letting family/friends know about it or blast them on social media - cause the lake has a LOT of advocates in town\u2026 the name of the lake is actually the name of the restaurant - why wouldn\u2019t they be working extra hard to keep it clean?\n\nTL;DR I went out to dinner and noticed the restaurant was letting the trash overflow into the lake and ask the manager politely to clean it up.

I'm past my middle age and just want a cake job to retire with where I can't be bugged basically something I can show up for, know how to do, and get paid. Fuck all to boredom. I need boredom right now even though i still have that itch.\n\nFlash forward, to find the job I wanted to retire with got hired as simply Lead Cook with emphasis on handling Caterings in an institutional environment. M-Thursday 7am to 5 pm is what I work. But I have found and in my 2+ years of this job is ALL the exec turnover. I wanted to get out of the grind and the cutthroat mindsets of some of these chefs who will take an entire team down to save there own asses. That is how institutionalized Chefs operate I suppose, but I have been through like 6 of them in 2 years and they  all behave the same. They ALL micromanage the SHIT out of me. . Yes, Just me. Not anyone else. Just me.\n\nI know why they do it. I know I have more real world experience and I can't seem to willfully be able to turn my chef notch down and NOT make good food when I have the ingredients. That is My job, as Caterer they put me in that position for the sole purpose of giving me a certain degree of culinary autonomy to do the executive caterings. So I do it like I would anywhere else. These Chefs, all 6 that I have been though have always made sly comments like: That looks better than what I could do, or I would get a big complimentary email from a client, or the Area director would come in and see one of my spreads and compliment it.  \nThese Chefs seem to hate that as always after they request me to go \"help\" Dishes, or go Take out trash etc. They all micromanage on a level to where I feel like I gotta ask to pee. I don't know how to dumb down myself to suit the personnel. But I get a sense that every exec assumes I want their job and try to protect it, so I always feel like I'm in a state of getting \"run off\".\n\nHow do I enforce to these chefs without directly telling them \" I don't want your job\"? So they have less to feel a threat by? Surely some of you have been in this situation where you are extremely over qualified for the job you do but are resented on the assumption that I do well because I want their job? They are all about the cutthroat mentality so I think they assume I am as well and am coming to take jobs. I don't know how to tell them without offending them further or making them feel more inadequate. They all seem insecure.

{"title": "Well Chefs quit my job", "selftext": "But not the kitchen life. This was in my eyes a fancy strip club with a fancy kitchen. Or at least it was supposed to be. We were supposed to be hiring new chefs that would curate a menu, and we'd go from there. But of course, the Texas based owners who ran our spot in Minnesota. Never seemed to want to budge on anything but bar food. The place before the pandemic was allegedly spankin in terms of food and service. But of course, since then, the owners wanted to cheap out on everything. \n\nI was only there for a year. But my original boss was fired. They had promised me that I'd replace him, but of course, they never did move past the talking stage. So the kitchen kind of went rudderless for a month or so. Just slow service as usual. But then they started asking me to curate new menu items, do inventory, and help with ordering. And I did thinking I was being promoted. But of course, it never came. \n\nThen they finally hired a new Chef who had great recipes, but he had this communication problem. He would never text or tell me what his specials were that they had planned to serve the customers. So I was stuck either making stuff on the fly to compensate for it or telling them I didn't have the ingredients to do so. \n\nBut eventually, I was just sick of the pressure to do more than I was being paid to do. I told them that if they wanted me to source ingredients, plan specials, and help with kitchen management, we could discuss my hourly pay.\n\nThat discussion never came. So yesterday I bit the bullet and said farewell. The ladies were nice, and the tips were great. But the kitchen situation was a joke.

{"title": "\"Mean girl\" (grown woman!) prep cook- what would you do?", "selftext": "After 22 years with the same company, I started a new job as a catering coordinator, with a small nonprofit.\n\nWe have a prep cook, line cook, lead cook, catering coordinator, cafe/catering mgr and two baristas. The assistant culinary director is above all of us. \n\nI've been there 1.5 months and like it ok but I've run into a \"mean girl clique\", as if I were back in HS. \n\nApparently, the cafe mgr and the prep cook are bff's. In addition to the cafe mgr and the assistant director being friends. I'm also a minority in this kitchen. I'm white. I speak Spanish better than I understand it. I'm about 75% fluent in spoken Spanish. \n\nThe prep cook bullies the line cook and gets away with it. We have a seasonal menu. The spring menu just rolled out Monday and the line cook is still arranging it according to what works for her and the lead cook. The prep cook keeps rearranging it back to how she likes, even though she doesn't do the line. \n\nWhen I saw the walkin, I wondered why all the top shelves were empty. I finally realized it was because everyone who works there is short and can't reach. There's lots of space that isn't being used up top. It could be organized better, but if I did organize it, with permission, I'm sure the prep cook would probably move everything back. \n\nTwo days ago I freed up a rack for catering orders/prep. I noticed someone (prep cook) has moved everything back onto my shelf. This has happened twice. \n\nYesterday I cut perfect squares of melons and pineapple, picked grapes, and went through an entire case of strawbs to find the smallest ones and removed the stems. These are for fruit skewers. I stored the strawbs in their own pan, dated and labeled it catering. I left everything else in another pan, dated and labeled it as catering. \n\nToday I came into the walkin looking for my fruit. The prep cook was in there with me. I asked if she used it. And she looked like a deer in headlights! She tried to tell me that it wasn't labeled. I called her out on it. Then she tried to tell me there were cut berries in it and I can't cut berries the day before. I let her know the berries were in another pan. Then I told her she needed to cut me new fruit into perfect squares. She said ok. Then I noticed my rack was full of shit again! I asked her why she keeps moving things back to my rack? Am I not allowed to have a single rack in the walkin? So she started moving everything back and clearing up my space. \n\nThe entire conversation was in Spanish and was also in front of the cafe mgr, who she has known for 14 years. \n\nLater on, I went back in the walkin and noticed the plastic on my berries was removed and replaced with plastic without a label or date (this place has GOT to be paying off the health dept...no one dates anything!) WHY? I labeled and dated it catering. \n\nWhat would you do? I'm borderline ready to be petty. This woman wants to fuck around and find out or something! Moving forward, I plan on storing prep on the top shelves so she can't even see what it is. But shit, it's slow enough for the cafe that this grown ass 56 year old woman has time for games!

An ap\u00e9ritif before I made my long suffering bartender party to the crimes I planned to commit. \n\nThe crimes of which were simple to commit. A malort martini: \u201c(long pause, a stare gauging the soundness of my soul) \u2026dirty?\u201d, \u201cobviously\u201d then a trip to the glassware rack. It\u2019s possible this is one of a short grip of times any fool has ordered a martini in the history of the shop, so unsurprisingly the search turns fruitless and we settle on a short goblet for the deed. \n\nWhat I expected in that puss-yellow gimlet of vermouth, malort, and olive juice was the distillated flavor of the slow death of hopes and dreams a man consigned to the industry incurs, the essence of the sound of birds outside your window post-coke bender and pre-clopen. \n\nWhat I got was surprisingly drinkable. Salt from the olive brine, vermouth (not enough on the first pass) and the botanicals of the malort. It\u2019s\u2026 not a good drink, more drinkable then a clean malort shot by far, actually has merits. 7/10 would drink again.\n\nThe bartenders sensing blood in the water continued, the floodgates now opened. Next a malort Negroni. Sweet vermouth covers a lot of the malort, orange peel pulls weight as well. I\u2019m not actually sure if it\u2019s better than the martini because it obfuscates the malort more 5/10 probably won\u2019t order again. \n\nNext, quick fire after the Negroni I have a malort Ferrari foisted on me. It\u2019s the worst of the bunch. Heavily malort-forward. The last two have been improvements over just having a shot of malort, this is just malort with extra steps.  3/10 do not recommend. \n\nBonus: The fireball manhattan off the ticket.\nJesus Christ it\u2019s worse than the malort. Cinnamon overcomes everything. Manhattan is salted with a dirty bomb of cinnamon. Children play in the streets with a dry dusting of red herb on their coats. It\u2019s real bad don\u2019t do it 1/10\n\nNow oiled up, I take my day of rest before going back into an institutional kitchen down 3 cooks out of 6 after a firing spree with a 2500 some conference. Pray for me. \n\nEdit: I am adding +1 point to the malortini post-scientific endeavor based on the input of a bar patron post experiment stating: \u201cyour ass is fantastic\u201d. Because I was currently trying to operate a peddle-operated vehicle I couldn\u2019t confirm the quality of the fineness of the person offering the compliment, I will however ride that high for the next decade as is the tradition of our people.

{"title": "Vent- Had to cancel popup last minute a week ago", "selftext": "I'm making a clean break from the industry in about a month when I graduate from college, but for the time being I still scratch that itch.\n\n I've taken over a student organization at my school that does popups and I was organizing one this semester. Last week we did prep Saturday & Sunday for Monday service and I came in about 45 minutes before service and found the fridge we had all the prep in wide open, so I had to cancel last minute. I'm annoyed and kinda pissed it happened, but it happens.\n\nHowever, what I am pissed about is that the chef, (works for the third party my school hires) was a pain in my ass the entire time. She kept touching my shit and being up my ass the entire time.\n\n I took out a red cutting board because I needed to cut raw chicken- she told me that \"red board is only for raw meats\" and I told her I know, I have red meat to cut, but she put it away and swapped it with the wrong color board... \n\nshe told me my stock was overfilled, and I said \"thank you, i'll get it in a minute\" and started moving shit ontop of my burners while I was trying to move a giant pot of rice (4 burner large pot)- I told her to hold the fuck up because she was in my way, and she started lecturing me about respect.\n\n  \nShe fucked up on order the right amount of meat, and before I checked and I was asking if she had more, she started lecturing me about how I was the one who fucked up- given the amount I ordered wasn't enough anyways, and thats on me- but you act like everything I do is a nuisance for you. Like i asked for a bit of spices to do family meal, and she was acting like I was fucking up her whole inventory. Like I only asked for a couple fucking grams of spaces.\n\n  \nOn Monday when the fridge door was open, I went up to talk to her incase maybe the fridge had just been opened. I ended up having to throw everything away, and she came back 10 minutes later with 2 papers printed out- 1 with an email that vaguely talked about \"improper food handling\" that made it look like I don't know how to handle food 2. an updated inventory sheet that still had everything on it, except for a couple To-go containers removed because \"I wont be needing it anymore\"\n\n  \nLike, I can be unprofessional sometimes, so fine, but FUCK YOU.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1jzffv4/vent_had_to_cancel_popup_last_minute_a_week_ago/", "created_utc": 1744679645.0, "score": 7, "author": "Interesting_Dish_431", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1jzffv4/vent_had_to_cancel_popup_last_minute_a_week_ago/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I can\u2019t win. (Go go gadget, wall of text!)", "selftext": "Today was an absolute clusterfuck. To start off, I\u2019m limping because my left big toe is infected, so that\u2019s nice. \n\nI work in a relatively small joint managed\u2026 not so well. If I was the inspector I think my soul would leave my body if I saw a tenth of what goes on there, but more on that later.\n\nSo I come in and slam my weekly monster because I had a divine premonition (walk in 20 top) that shit was gonna be ass, and brother, all we had was taco bell and laxatives. My position is what I\u2019d like to call \u201cSalad Bitch+,\u201d basically I do salads, deserts, keep rolls in the window, and drop shit in the mic for hot wheel. However, this joint is tiny and cramped as shit. The window for rolls in the middle of our narrow ass line where hot wheel, fryer, and broiler are all converging (me as well) so when you do rolls you gotta get those bitches from the back behind the line, bring em up, and get em in the window. It\u2019s not bad on its own, but when you have a recipe for the kitchen sink coming from your printer and your foot feels like it had an anvil dropped on it all of the running back and forth can be a bitch, and that\u2019s if you even get a chance to get rolls. If deserts, the window, to go rolls, and salads are coming through I cannot physically manage them all and I have to let one of them slip. This usually being window rolls as I prioritize dropping my tickets. \n\nI\u2019m new to the industry and I\u2019ve only been at this place for a few months, but I thought I had a handle on things by now\u2026 but I guess I was wrong. My GM was irritated that I fell behind in the absolute clusterfuck of tickets I had coming in. Hell, I couldn\u2019t clear more than half because I was still waiting on the protein for them. But anyways, yeah that position can be a bitch to handle solo. I\u2019m sure there are others, but I\u2019m just not fast enough. \n\nI think what nearly caused me to crash out though was a waitress. She rang in a caesar and then stood at the line staring at me as I made it. Then, after WATCHING ME make it to order she said, \u201cThis has been sitting in the (mixing) bowl too long.\u201d Like, THE FUCK IT HAS, you WATCHED ME MAKE IT. She\u2019s also constantly going off about me putting too much dressing in salads, and then always comes back when I make em the way she likes saying she needs an extra on side dressing. Some people ffs. \n\nOh yeah also my window isn\u2019t even an arms length across. It\u2019s tiny. Hot wheel\u2019s window is slightly bigger, but still can\u2019t fit an 8 top\u2019s order all at once. So, that\u2019s fun. \n\nYeah thanks for coming to my ted talk. I\u2019m done with today.

{"title": "Is quitting justified?", "selftext": "For context I started working at an assisted living home a few months back right out of college to make ends meet. I have kitchen experience working at summer camps and bars & whatnot so that wasn\u2019t an issue. \n\nAnyway, it was just the kitchen manager and I for a bit and that was fine. We managed to get everything out for our residents and dishes done within a timely manner. Fast forward a few weeks and he gets canned, no warning whatsoever. From then on it\u2019s been just me in the kitchen with the exception of a temp on my days off.  \n\nI guess I\u2019ve proven myself worthy of running the kitchen by myself to management because now they\u2019re fucking me. I told them as soon as the kitchen manager was fired that I can\u2019t do this job alone, yet here I am, alone. I\u2019ve asked them about hiring another person but they haven\u2019t really shown any effort whatsoever. \n\nI\u2019m doing breakfast, lunch, dinner, two desserts a day, & all the dishes for this place by myself with no help. The only thing I\u2019m not doing is creating the menu, you know who is tho? Some ass hat manager who has no idea how to run a kitchen or how inconvenient some of these meals are.  Half the time we don\u2019t even have the ingredients for the shit they put on there so I\u2019m stuck creating shit on the fly.\n\nNot only that but they find ways to fuck me on the schedule so I don\u2019t get any OT, even tho I\u2019m in that kitchen way before my shift starts and way later than it ends.  The other week they had me on 8 days with no break and I almost walked out on the spot on day 7.  The following week I hear from the temp that management hadn\u2019t contacted anyone from their agency to come in for the rest of April. It\u2019d be just me without a day off for weeks if he hadn\u2019t said something. It\u2019s bad enough that they have me working Easter alone, idk how they thought they could get away with a whole month. \n\nOne last thing to mention, this kitchen is a shit show. Our vent hood hasn\u2019t worked for the past week, our flattop went out two weeks ago, & our door handles keep falling off.  \n\n\nI know it could be a lot worse but idk man. I didn\u2019t go to school for this and I sure as hell didn\u2019t sign up for the ass fucking from management. I had a job interview for something closer to my field of study last week, I\u2019ll hear back on Wednesday.  I really don\u2019t want to fuck over the guys from the temp agency because I really like them, but I can\u2019t take any more of this bullshit.

{"title": "I might be going back to the kitchen", "selftext": "I guess I should preface this with a little backstory.   \n\nI worked in the kitchen from 2008-2022. I went from dish washer to line cook to a manager-ish role back to line cook to sous chef back to line cook, prep cook then I left in 2022. I was at one place from 2014- 2022. I worked as sous for a little over 2 years. I had to step down because of alcoholism seeping ever further into my life. \n\nI negotiated a salary prep cook position, at that point my life was made unmanageable by the drink. I drank to feel normal. To feel relief from my constant anxiety and (unknown at the time) CPTSD. It stopped working. It stopped doing what I needed it to do. \n\nSo instead of continuing and getting fired, loosing everything in the process, I went to rehab. I was gone for 2 1/2 months. Rehab for 30 days and a month after that of time off to \u201cgain some stability\u201d at least until I ran out of money. \n\nI went back to my job as a dishwasher at a different location. It was fine, but I wasn\u2019t making enough money and my (still unknown to me) CPTSD was making stability very difficult. Images of being on the line deep in the shit were constant flashing through my head when I was there and sinking feelings of panic accompanied them. \n\nMy dream of becoming a chef was over. I knew I had to leave or risk relapsing. So, I did. I found a really relaxing job as an exterminator. I drive around in a truck by myself going to 10-20 peoples houses and treating them for bugs. Unfortunately, that peaceful job has been plagued with my life having constant barriers. My fianc\u00e9 getting shot, money issues, a small lapse where I drank for a few days and went back to rehab. \n\nIve had a tough time letting go of the feeling that I need to fix my fianc\u00e9\u2019s problems (she\u2019s bipolar 1) and i would put all the pressure of figuring out what\u2019s wrong with me while trying to work while she goes to school, struggling to pay the bills, buy food for us and the 3 pets we have (one of the cats we recused from a soup can on her head in our back yard and sort of adopting her, just had 4 kittens and we\u2019re now making sure they\u2019re safe and trying to find homes for the kittens when they turn 8 weeks and a home for the mother (we can\u2019t afford to keep her). \n\nAfter a heart to heart wife my fianc\u00e9, we both agreed that school was too much for her mentally right now (surviving being shot in the neck and having PTSD having just had a psychotic break and having to go back to the psych ward for 2 weeks will do that to her) and I also need her working full time so we can catch up. \n\nAnyways, yeah, my life can be viewed as a nightmare when you frame it *just* like that. I\u2019ve been in therapy, I\u2019ve had a psych eval, gotten my medication somewhat where I want it. We\u2019re still tweaking my vyvanse and celexa, but I\u2019ve got a good hold on things lately. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m an alcoholic and I stepped back from pursuing my dream job to recover and realized that it\u2019s not something that I can pursue at least for the time being. \n\n\nNow that those of you you are still reading are all caught up; The other day I\u2019m scrolling on indeed and I find a prep cook position offering $17-$22/hr which, where I live, is unheard of. I apply, figuring that it\u2019s probably bullshit. The gm texted me the next day asking me to come in for an interview. \n\nThe interview went pretty good. The position sounds pretty stress free (not having to work on the line is a big one for me) and the $22 I held firm on, and she, looking at my resume, agreed that if they\u2019re offering up to $22/hr that i meet whatever requirements they could possibly have for that pay. She said she\u2019d call me by Monday. I don\u2019t have a great feeling since she asked what the lowest pay I\u2019d accept would be and I said $22 is the lowest. \n\nAnyway, seems pretty chill. It\u2019s a restaurant that\u2019s been in my city for over 30 years and they have great reviews and 5 locations. \n\nIm waiting to hear from her, with the expectation that I\u2019ll get it, but my gut\u2026.. idk what it\u2019s telling me. I feel comfortable where I work in terms of stress management, but the pay and inability to make more money or move up really weighs on me. Idk if this is the right move or if I\u2019m making a huge mistake. \n\nI loved being a sous when the stress was manageable. I loved making specials, solving problems, ordering food trucks, shit I liked doing inventory and scheduling. But just writing this, thinking about the job, my chest feels tight.

{"title": "Making a relationship with a head chef work who seems to struggle with texting communication", "selftext": "As the title says, I\u2019m (F 26) dating this guy (M 24) who is a head chef at a huge restaurant that newly opened downtown where we live. We\u2019ve been seeing each other since January and things have been going well. I love spending time with him, we always have such an amazing and special time when we\u2019re in person together and feeling like things are going in a great direction. \n\nThe problem I\u2019ve noticed is communication between us, specifically with texting. As far as attachment styles, I think I am a bit more anxious where he\u2019s a little avoidant. I put affirmation behind texting but only when I\u2019m newly dating someone. I\u2019ve been trying to reframe it to just enjoy when we spend quality time together and not all the texting. He works SO much since the restaurant newly opened, he\u2019s pretty good in his actions which is my favorite thing about him. I see him regularly, and when he\u2019s falling behind with effort and that\u2019s been communicated, he makes time for us and steps up. Outside of work, he has a lot of life stuff going on (his dad recently got diagnosed w cancer)\n\nAt first, we would text every day and it was pretty consistent and then the restaurant opened, I noticed we texted less and then it got better again, it\u2019s been pretty inconsistent in terms of texting giving me anxiety. For example, this week he noticed he hadn\u2019t been texting me as much so he texted me to apologize and tell me that he got sick this week (i got him sick lol) so I really appreciated that because I have said that communication is a big thing for me and really important to me. I responded to his text on Thursday saying that I was off work on Friday if he wanted do something after work and I still haven\u2019t heard back from him. It\u2019s not the first time this has happened, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily happen often.\n\nWhenever we\u2019ve talked about it he\u2019s told me that he\u2019s gets in super work mode and completely forgets to respond and gets distracted & then goes home and passes out.\n\nAnyway, Im wondering how can I navigate this with someone in this field? He has so much going on rn that I feel horrible voicing anything, he very recently found out about his dad\u2019s cancer diagnosis so I\u2019m also trying to allow space and not feel like I\u2019m pushing him. Anyway, I have strong feelings for him and see a serious future between us so I want it to work. All and any advice is welcome!!

{"title": "Just whining about a coworker", "selftext": "\nThis is a massive rant. I genuinely just wanted to shout into the void. If you want to avoid bad vibes and a whiny line cook complaining, scroll on :)\n\n\n\n\n\nI work in a nursing home kitchen. The way the kitchen works is weird. We supply three \"satellites\" which, servers work in and send out the food we make in our main kitichen- we also have a main dining room that fits a single lunch seating and two for dinner. Those are usually 100-150 people a piece over roughly 45 minutes. One position handles making our \"mains\" (protines, soups, and the garnishes for each), plating and any sauces. The other handles altered diets (Purees, mechanicals, chopped, ccho, heart healthy etc) the sides and the backline (a large carte). I've worked in kitchens since I was 14. A while with a catering company my mom ran, nothing serious really. Mostly fast food or a gas station kitchen. \n\n\nAll of this is just background context because I've now spent a year and decent change in this kitchen. I wouldn't call myself incredible what I do. I'm learning a lot, and steadily getting better, but I would really only call myself competent.\n\n\nWe hired someone recently with claimed decades working as a line cook. Listed some proper resturants as some experience, too. They are hands down one of the hardest to work with humans I have ever met. I am so confused as to why, in the comparatively easy-as-shit kitchen i work in am I able to literally run circles around them. Some examples\n\nRegularly cannot get mains or soup done in time for service. Exe chef has to step in and help get things distributed and panned. We have from roughly 1130 to 4 to make two main protines, and a soup. Not enough time for them. \n\nI have to hear them bitch and moan for like 10 minutes when servers ask for something without saying please. Note they regularly don't bother with niceties when asking for things themselves. Personally I am of a mind when we're in the middle of trying to slam all these plates out I don't want you to waste any breath when you need something from me. Tell me what you need, get it, and get back to whatever you need to do. Otherwise yeah, I'll be nice and try to be polite.\n\nThrows little tantrums whenever we run low on something, or they recieve any criticism. Was told a soup that was made was a little to think for the old people (for some reason they want soups almost thicker than gravy) but if it were anywhere else it would be perfect. This ruined their entire day and they loudly and repeatedly blamed our sous for this because he \"didn't come check on them\". Made chili once and during our lineup the servers tasted it and said it wasn't very good. Claimed it was their first time making it. After decades working in foodservice. Chili.\n\nLeaves the kitchen for ~10 minutes at the start of service to \"go to the bathroom\". Every service. Every day.\n\nIs also just sensitive. To be fair, this I think is me just being a dick, but the kitchen I am in regularly talks shit amongst ourselves. Not jn any kind of malicious way. Just the regular banter bullshit. Definitely cannot say a word to them though or you'll get a tantrum.\n\nRegularly forgets things called for when A la carte is ordered. Once, asking three times for an omlette, it took them fifteen minutes to start it. Wasn't even doing anything, either. Just standing around jabbering in my ear about shit I genuinely don't give a fuck about, like places they have worked or weird shit from their life. Will also prioritize prepping dinner sides over making the A la carte orders needed at lunch. \n\nLeaves me with about 2 days in 14 that I can actually look forward to going into work. I love my job, I love the work I do. But fuck has this person spoiled a lot of my joy for where I work.

{"title": "I crashed out on the line today", "selftext": "I thought I\u2019d share how things went today at my new job. \n\nMy 10th shift (second shift not in training anymore) as a line cook started off like the first 9. Pretty solid, strong, with a building confidence that I\u2019m catching on, and can handle my station now. I\u2019m beginning to know what needs to be done, when, and even how in full detail. I\u2019m developing a system and organization that really works smoothly for me. As the restaurant opened, and orders began to pour in, I held it down. Lunch gets REALLY busy for us, and through the hour of 11 o\u2019clock, we were steady, I was strong, and for the first time, I felt like a real member of the crew. Through the hour of twelve, and even to 1:30, I breezily and swiftly kept up with a steady pace of orders just as well as the people who were training me days ago would. \n\nTypically, by 130-2, our lunch rush (our busiest one, I\u2019d say - it\u2019s predominantly a sandwich place, amongst other \u2018takeout/pizza/burger\u2019 sortsa things in an industrial area so around the 9-5ers break times gets crazy) begins winding down. The last couple days have been weird, in this regard. Today, like yesterday, the lunch rush - the real lunch rush, not just the steady inpouring of a few orders at a time through the hour of noon today, but the relentless army of tickets that showed up to beat me silly like I owe them money - began to march from the printer machine at 1:45 like a gateway to some horrible land that would make the long-time senior citizens of hell itself shudder at the thought of passing through briefly opened up and lets its very worst onto my sandwich station. \n\nAnd I failed. I didn\u2019t waver. I didn\u2019t stumble. I crashed and burned to such epic proportions. I made history in your industry in just 10 short days, I imagine: I think in all of the history of line cooking, no one lost grip of the situation as badly as me, today. Me, who started his shift feeling so confident and in control and well and.. *accepted*. Fuck. Accepted. I\u2019ll save you the entire history of my childhood and formative years but, just know there is an endless mountain of things most people wouldn\u2019t dream of doing once, that I would endure for eternity\u2019s to enjoy 10 seconds of knowing that someone is merely *pretending* to *accept me*. And it was happening. The owner and chef of this place greets me with an uncharacteristic smile each day, tells me I\u2019m learning good, takes the time of day to chat and get to know me, pulls me aside and shows me things because he knows I\u2019m hungry for knowledge - more hungry for it than a lot of others, even. The girl who trained me, a badass in her own right on the line that I look up to, tells me how good I\u2019m doing and is always encouraging and is starting to treat me like I\u2019m good, I got it handled, I am like one of them now and know what I\u2019m doing on my station (a very busy one, I will say, in a sandwich/lunch sorta spot like this). They\u2019re all treating me like that. In the early part of today, when things were steady, I overheard that girl telling the owner \u201che\u2019s really good, he doesn\u2019t even need anyone over there helping him he\u2019s doing great, he knows what he\u2019s doing already.\u201d I heard the owner then discussing the last few rough hires they had, and saying \u201cwell I really think things are turning around with him here.\u201d It really reinforced the comfort and confidence I\u2019d built. \n\nAnd then the lunch rush happened. And the mistakes happened. One, after another, after another, after another, after another, and they just did.. not stop. I cannot even explain to you, how un-explainably hard I am on myself. One simple mistake is the sort of thing I tend to beat myself up for 20 years over - and I mean beat myself up so bad it\u2019s like the combined beating every professional boxer has ever taken in history, combined in one beating. For one mistake on my own breakfast at home on a random Tuesday. Today - and I\u2019m really trying so hard not to exaggerate I\u2019m going to low-ball it here - I\u2019d say around 100 mistakes or way more in a row were made. Given how hard of a time I just told you I give myself for that sort of thing, I hope you understand that after the very first one or two, I was so intensely locked in to every single letter on every single order sheet that I probably looked like a complete psychopath, in order to make SURE I was paying attention. And yet still, as if my own brain and its focus-abilities had turned on me completely, I messed up every.. single.. one. Bad. Like, we had to redo everything, a hundred times over, in a pretty busy rush - but not even so busy that it was crazy, really, compared to other days. \n\nPeople began to yell at me - \u201cYOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION! READ THE TICKETS!\u201d I must have heard something like that, with a progressively harsh and angered tone, a million times today. The traits of my borderline personality disorder began to bubble up like the hatred of a million movie villains. At first the kind of shame one might feel if they found out they inadvertently killed 1 million infants, by making simple stupid mistakes, again and again and again. Then, seconds later, hatred. Violent, seething, fuming, disgusted hatred laced with an endless supply of paranoid madness, on the side. \n\nI hated my chef. I hated the girl who trained me, who was using an extremely sharp tone whenever speaking to me for any reason at this point, and giving me looks as if I was responsible for the death of her entire homeland whenever she looked at me - nearly always to address another mistake. I was trying as hard as I possibly, possibly could to not make any mistakes, and yet every SINGLE order looked exactly as if I sabotaged it as hard as humanly possible just to be an ass. I was not seconds, but milliseconds from either slamming both of my hands down on the grill and leaving them there until people tackled me to my safety, or screaming \u201cYA KNOW WHAT?! FUUUUUUUCKKKK!!!!!! YOOOOOOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!\u201d at the chef and hurling a bunch of burgers across the kitchen and storming off never to be seen again, or simply just piling any and all reachable objects onto the grill - plastic containers, ticket machines, aprons, rags, entire boxes of bread, knives - until everyone\u2019s total confusion at the bizarre behavior eventually had enough seconds of watching in disbelief that they recognized it as a severe mental health event. I had tears of rage welled up in my eyes, I was biting down so hard I almost knocked my bottom jaw onto the floor, I was shooting everyone looks that only the hated know. But it was hate for myself that I felt. And for everything. And everyone. And cooking. And this restaurant and everyone in it. And all restaurants, and everyone in them. And food itself. \n\nEventually, the rush ended, but order after order that rolled in after that, the mistakes continued. It got to the point the chef and all of my coworkers who admired me so much mere hours earlier, and used to be glad I was onboard the crew, were now shaking their heads in utter disbelief and disgust every single time they had to address yet another mistake. I began to crash out. I couldn\u2019t communicate. People would ask me if I put the bread in for something yet, and I wouldn\u2019t answer them. I wasn\u2019t able to. It was like I was a million miles away behind a million mile-thick wall of \u2018wanting to be anywhere but here, doing anything but this\u2019. I wanted to be fired, and exiled, and return to some kind of self-loathing, self-destroying life that I thrive in the misery and pain and turmoil and chaos of. Thrive in giving up, and suffering all of the pain that comes with it. Because that\u2019s hell. And this was so much worse. \u201cDo you have that meatball sub ready?!? Where is it?!?\u201d I didn\u2019t respond. I couldn\u2019t. These people didn\u2019t even feel real to me anymore. I was just waiting for them to throw me out the door and for this horror show to be over. I walked off of a station with a bunch of orders waiting to be done and just began catatonically, slowly sweeping the barely dirtied floor. I could see what was happening around me, but I wasn\u2019t really there. \n\nAnd then it happened. We got the call. The lady with the gluten allergy, who apparently I gave a regular wrap to, all glutened the fuck up. I could see the anger and stress and outrage building in the coworkers, owner/chef included, discussing this situation. And sure enough, they revealed it was me. I did it. What a surprise. I started to mutter \u201cyou have to be fucking kidding me, what the fuck\u201d to myself. The chef was going OFF! \u201cCome on! This is BASIC STUFF! You gotta be kidding me man! Pay attention!! Read the orders! This is allergy stuff! You could kill someone!!\u201d \n\nTo make it worse, when the lady returned to the restaurant to switch it out for a gluten free wrap (she knew it wasn\u2019t a gluten wrap, good thing.. maybe she should have my job), I handed it to her and took the initiative to apologize personally, which was the first thing I was able to speak to a human being in like hours, hours during which it felt as if I could never speak to a human being again without bursting into hysterical tears about this day. I gave her such a professional, warm, sincere, heartfelt apology - which is a huge deal for me. It\u2019s rare, and a big step in humility in my life - my therapist would be proud of the years of work we\u2019ve done to get me to the point I could step up to this kind of accountability and responsibility and human connectivity. And this lady looked at me like I kicked every single pet she ever owned to death while laughing at her, and said \u201cokay! you need to be more careful!\u201d and stormed off in a way that promised no return. She\u2019s a regular customer. I turned around to my whole crew looking at me as if that was going easy on me, as if they were upset she didn\u2019t hop the counter, grab the chef\u2019s knife off my station and behead me with it right there. \n\nI didn\u2019t speak to anyone for what felt like - or may have actually been - hours. A buddy of mine from the prep area said wutsup to me and I only shot him a glare worthy of a man on-screen Joker performance, before disappearing to the walk-in to shout obscenities and evils and drool on myself and punch a bag of onions. \n\nAfter an eternity of being near-catatonic, practically unable to work at all (like really, not even working at this point, just haunting the kitchen unable to focus at all on even a single order slip and what it was telling me to do), and literally not trusting that anything I thought was correct and that I thought I was doing properly regarding any order that popped up was actually correct, as if reality itself were a repetitive mean trick fooling me into making mistakes by altering itself after the orders were completed to make what I did wrong, I eventually had a chat with a line cook there who kinda teaches me some shit and who I kinda trust. I told him how upset I was. How I was about to storm out and be done. He was encouraging, and then a lot of the others who were pretty damn upset with me earlier and came around and were nicer. I think they could see I was moment away from storming out of a place via a hole where there used to be a window I hurled a chair through or something like that. Even the chef stopped being angry when he talked to me. A bit upset though. After today, I feel like I\u2019m one more mistake away from being booted out the door. All I can do is curse Anthony Bourdain for writing a book that tricked me into liking this thing at some point during my lifelong identity crisis. \n\nI\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m trying as hard as I can not to make a mistake, and I still made THAT many mistakes that were THAT bad. I feel like when I make my next mistake, I\u2019m going to storm off into whatever god awful chaos and treacheries and tortures awaits those who don\u2019t have employment in capitalistic societies in 2025 to drown in them forever. \n\nEDIT: for all of the kind words, encouragement, constructive advice, and comeraderie - thank you so much! It means a lot to me. For the compliments on my writing, that means a real lot to me too. Thank you, hope you\u2019re all having a good day! For those saying 12 paragraphs was the TDLR-iest thing they\u2019ve ever encountered in their life, idk man then just like\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 read it. Like idk what to tell ya, don\u2019t read it, it\u2019s gonna be fine, you won\u2019t die if you don\u2019t read it. So like, it\u2019s gonna be fine. For those saying I must be on drugs, I\u2019m not drugs stress me tf out man. For those saying I\u2019m trying to be Anthony Bourdain, I guess thank you even though I\u2019m not cuz like, he\u2019s a good writer. But also, I think pretty different than me. Bourdain woulda laced this with way more self-deprecating humor and highlighted the misery of it in a much more playful way where he and his pain is the butt of the joke. My voice is very different I\u2019d say, very much darker and more filled with real intense rage and self-disgust, rather than humorous self-deprecation. To everyone else thank you for the kindness, I\u2019m going back in it tomorrow and I\u2019m determined to do better.

{"title": "How to properly handle wine?", "selftext": "Just had a debate about this with a customer and it got me thinking. \n\nI'm from Europe and the customer claimed that once any edible or drinkable item is out of the box, it can't go into the box. This makes sense for the most part as it wouldn't be safe and there are all these contamination issues.\n\nHowever, we were specifically talking about wine. They saw me pouring it to a glass, I left to take it to a table (and unbeknownst to them, another waiter had already brought their wine so it was a double booking), I returned with it and then they saw me pouring it back to the bottle. Hence the argument. \n\nI personally see nothing wrong with it. I poured it to a clean glass straight from the bar and it took me 5 minutes until it was back in the bottle and the glass in the dish. We do this all the time to save money on wines and we even combine bottles to save storage space as long as their opening dates are not far from each other. \n\nSo what is your opinion? Is this disgusting and against proper food handling, a loophole in the law or just a totally normal thing to do?
