Before it was in the 90s and above. \n\nI OFFICIALLY NO LONGER HAVE PCOS AND AM NO LONGER PRE-DIABETIC. This is the best part! I used to have to take a ton of metformin every morning which made me feel like shit at the start of every day. No more! My doctor took me off of it and told me to keep doing what I\u2019m doing, and that she is proud of me. :)  The only medication I still take is 10mg of Lisinopril for blood pressure. (Down from 20mg) I look forward to saying goodbye to that as well in 2020. \n\nI know I have farther to go than what is behind me. I am still morbidly obese, but I feel really confident and strong. I know that if I keep going, I will only see positive results. \n\nMy goal in 2020 is to work out more and get 45-90 min of exercise a day, per Dr. Greger. I\u2019m looking forward to reading \u201chow not to diet\u201d and implementing his \u201c21 tweaks\u201d. I\u2019m already seeing positive results from the tweaks.  My goal is to lose an average of 1.5lbs a week, and end the year at 250. That is what I weighed in high school my 10th year when I first started tracking my weight regularly.\n\nThank you all for being supportive, uplifting, and informative. I am eternally grateful, you have no idea. \n\nHappy new year and here\u2019s to a healthy 2020!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ehx3bg/started_eating_plant_based_at_the_beginning_of/", "created_utc": 1577762778.0, "score": 897, "author": "None", "num_comments": 64, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ehx3bg/started_eating_plant_based_at_the_beginning_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Update on wife with cancer", "selftext": "I posted here about a year and a half ago about my wife\u2019s successes with our WFPB diet and I wanted to give an update. \n\nShe ended up being progression-free for a year and a half on her last treatment, and the average for that treatment is 7.8 months. We were obviously bummed to see it return, but being on the far right of the bell curve is still something to be happy about. \n\nNow she is in a clinical trial for an exciting new drug. The side effects are apparently pretty serious, and there are only five participants so far who have been placed on a full dose. My wife is one of them. She just finished her one month mark and went in for blood work, where she was told she is the only one able to tolerate the treatment. The main side effects are nausea and a lowered white blood cell count. Her WBC count did drop some, but not into the danger zone and is improving with every blood test (one per week). She is also prone to nausea but has had hardly any. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t scheduled to see any doctors, just the PA, but 5 ended up coming into her room quizzing her on everything she is doing, wanting to figure out what is different about her. They are finally interested in what she is eating! The head MD/scientist told her he\u2019s putting 15 doctors on her case that she can contact at any time, and told us we are going to become like family. They want to know everything she does in life. I\u2019ve read stories about new breakthrough treatments and that first patient that proves that the drug works. We were joking from the beginning of the trial that maybe she could be one of those stories, but now it almost feels like it\u2019s possible. We just read \u201cWhy We Sleep,\u201d and have been putting a greater emphasis on good sleep, but we really attribute her health to the WFPB diet. We\u2019ve seen so many positive health changes in her, me, and the few family members who have started to eat this way to believe otherwise. It\u2019s like we have a secret weapon, but the only reason it is secret is because most doctors don\u2019t want to hear about it. Maybe this will help put another crack in that wall. \n\nPS: I was surprised, especially for this subreddit, at some of the negative responses that I got when I posted about this a year and a half ago, of people accusing me of raising others\u2019 hopes when this may not work for them. So I want to say upfront that this is anecdotal evidence only. Obviously. When it comes to cancer, there is nothing we know of that will cure every cancer. If there were, we wouldn\u2019t still be dying from it. But the evidence of the benefits of this way of eating seems to be way more compelling than most doctors give it credit for, which is why we have subreddits like this to begin with. It\u2019s exciting stuff, and it\u2019s a difficult way to eat in this culture, and I hope to encourage anyone who needs encouragement to stick it out of that\u2019s what they want to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/k207yb/update_on_wife_with_cancer/", "created_utc": 1606479986.0, "score": 693, "author": "El-Coco-No", "num_comments": 73, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/k207yb/update_on_wife_with_cancer/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

You\u2019re probably aware that the science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality.\n\nThe meal plan generation algorithm is based on information presented on nutritionfacts.org, which I believe to be the most trustworthy source of evidence based nutrition information. What it currently does is analyze a recipe\u2019s ingredients (down to the gram) and combine recipes in such a way that every day of the meal plan satisfies (or nearly satisfies) [nutritionfact.org\u2019s daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) foods you should incorporate into your diet daily.\n\nToday's update includes the most requested feature of all, ***calorie control***. you can now set a calorie range and each day of the plan will fall in that range.\n\nThis is an ongoing project that will be continually developed as new science becomes available. You can expect the introduction of further factors into the algorithm making the meal plans even healthier. It is intended to be a resource for all who care about applying the scientific evidence to live longer, healthier, happier lives. You can see what\u2019s coming next on the [public trello](https://trello.com/b/UQkPED8a/the-scientific-meal-planner).\n\nCheck it out!\n\nDaniel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fj0mi9/i_built_the_scientific_meal_planner_and_its_100/", "created_utc": 1584275349.0, "score": 610, "author": "DanTheProgrammingMan", "num_comments": 63, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fj0mi9/i_built_the_scientific_meal_planner_and_its_100/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

She would tell me all the time how great she feels having cut meat out of her diet, along with various other things like oil and cheese.\n\nI humored her by acting amazed, but I actually thought she was full of shit.\n\nAbout a month ago, she showed me this documentary called Game Changers (Netflix), and, after watching, I thought to myself _fine. I\u2019ll try it for a week so I can prove her wrong and rub it in her face._\n\nI didn\u2019t eat meat for a week, avoided oil, cheese, and anything dairy really. Tried a lot of new vegetables for kicks. Not once during that week did I have a stomach ache, not once did I have diarrhea, not once did I fall asleep in my chair after lunch, not once did I wake up in the morning with hiccups and a burning feeling in my esophagus, nor did I even wake up feeling, well, _tired._\n\nI now fully believe that humans were meant to live off fruits and vegetables. Me, a meat lover, something I couldn\u2019t go a day without. It seems that the eating of meat has only been glorified by the media; in reality our ancestors only ate meat in dire circumstances.\n\nIt\u2019s mind blowing to me how great I feel now. I thought I had a number of issues including IBS; I hadn\u2019t had a day in **years** where my stomach didn\u2019t ache after a meal, or where my heart didn\u2019t race, or where I didn\u2019t have to worry about blowing up the company bathroom 3 times a day. I had huge issues with tonsil stones and bad breath, now I haven\u2019t had these issues all month, in fact it\u2019s rare for me to even feel gunk on my teeth.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve witnessed a miracle. If the me two months ago would have read what I\u2019ve just written, she would have laughed and told me it\u2019s all a placebo effect and that _I\u2019m_ the one being brainwashed.\n\nIf only I\u2019d known how wrong I was earlier.\n\nIt\u2019s only been one month.\n\nI\u2019ve taken back control of my life in _one month._", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/e62sy3/story_time_meat_lover_tries_plantbased/", "created_utc": 1575481481.0, "score": 595, "author": "None", "num_comments": 157, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/e62sy3/story_time_meat_lover_tries_plantbased/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Really up until last month I have been going full damage mode on my body for 30 years. Soda and unhealthy processed foods multiple times a day. More meat than I can count or even contemplate how much I\u2019ve eaten throughout my life. And all the other BS I\u2019ve eaten throughout my life with no regard for my health. Let alone, cigarettes and Juul a good portion of my life. I was never informed before going up in the house very neat driven and not really health-conscious. Obviously the tobacco and nicotine I was aware of. Yesterday I went for a run in the first time in about six months and nearly died when I came back. Couldn\u2019t stand without getting lightheaded and almost falling had a cough and started getting shivers. So I was bed ridden. \n\n\nYesterday I watched \u201cgame changers\u201c. It was an awesome documentary and I\u2019m so happy I watched it because it gave me the push that I needed. I\u2019ve been dealing with ulcerative Colitis us for about 10 years now with no end in sight. Just saw a holistic doctor and now he\u2019s got me on a few natural remedies. I\u2019m essentially trying everything I can before I switch to Humira for life (which I do not want to do). Changed if diet and medicine. I started last month with a pescatarian diet but now I\u2019m cutting out fish and eggs also. Only veggies from here. \n\nIt\u2019s weird starting on the eve of Thanksgiving the day we\u2019re all the food comes out. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m gonna hear some grief from family and friends but a small price to pay for my health. Just wanna say I\u2019m happy I found the sub Reddit and happy to be a part of this community now. Just had my first plant-based breakfast and it was delicious! \n\nThank you all and love y\u2019all!

It arrived and they cooed over it being their favorite. The 8 year old ate one slice. The 10 year old almost finished her one slice and then got an orange. A couple of times my husband has offered them leftover pizza and they declined. Today I was headed to the grocery and they said there was nothing to eat. I suggested the pizza if they were really hungry. That's when they told me that they'd rather just wait because the pizza didn't taste how they remembered and it didn't make them feel great. Maybe we could just have some beans and rice when I got home.\n\nWell, okay! I didn't expect that one!

{"title": "REPOSTED: Purple Sweet Potato Roti, Tofu and Pumpkin Curry & Date, Nut and Beetroot Balls for Plant-Based Diwali", "selftext": "Mods previously deleted this post because I didn\u2019t provide the recipe on time. Sorry guys, I didn\u2019t realize the recipe was mandatory! So here it is:\n\nPURPLE SWEET POTATO ROTI:\n\nIngredients:\n1 purple sweet potato\n1 1/2 cup of flour (preferably whole wheat)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Peel the skin of the sweet potato and cut it into chunks. Set the chunks to boil until mashable. \n2. Strain the boiled sweet potato chunks. Pour them into a mixing bowl and mash. \n3. Add 1 cup of flour into the potato mash and initially mix it with a spoon. Be careful because it will be hot. After it\u2019s a bit mixed, you can combine it with your hands. Knead the mix into a dough.\n4. Set the dough aside in the mixing bowl covered for around 10 min. In the meantime, set aside a cup of flour and cover your rolling surface with flour.\n5. After ten minutes, pull off about a ping pong size chunk from the dough and roll it into a ball in your hands. Gently press the ball with your palms so it forms into a mochi shape. Then coat both sides of the mochi shaped dough with flour.\n6. Place the mochi shaped dough piece on the floured surface and roll with a rolling pin into a very thin circle (which is your uncooked roti). \n7. Being a pan to low-medium heat. Once the pan is warm, add the uncooked roti to the pan. Leave it for about 30 seconds before flipping it.  If you see bubbles forming, it means the roti is cooking. Be careful that it doesn\u2019t burn.\n8. Once it\u2019s cooked on both sides, set it aside. Repeat steps 5 to 8 for the remainder of the dough and that will complete your rotis.\n\n\nPUMPKIN TOFU CURRY:\n\nIngredients:\n1/2 can of pumpkin pur\u00e9e\n1/2 block of extra firm or superfirm tofu \n1/2 white or red onion\n2-3 cloves garlic\n1-2 inch piece of ginger root\n1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e \n1-2 tbsp of hemp seeds\n2-3 tbsp of fenugreek (essential for authenticity)\n\nSpices:\n1-2 tsp of coriander powder\n1/2 tsp black pepper\n1/4-1/2 tsp red chili powder (depending on heat tolerance)\n1/4 tsp cumin powder\n1/4 tsp turmeric\nSalt to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Water saut\u00e9 chopped onion, garlic and ginger on low-medium heat. Ensure it doesn\u2019t burn.\n2. Add the spices and combine very briefly before pouring in the pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Again, make sure the spices don\u2019t burn (I highly recommend portioning out the spice mix ahead of time).\n3. Stir in 1/3 cup of water and combine to cook. Add in tomato pur\u00e9e and hemp seeds.\n4. After it\u2019s cooked for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly to ensure that it doesn\u2019t burn, blend with an immersion blender (I used the nutribullet variety). If you don\u2019t have one, you can wait for the mixture to cool and add it to a conventional blender, but then this will take a bit longer.\n5. Once you\u2019ve blended the mixture into a smooth gravy, add tofu cut into blocks and dried fenugreek leaves. Cook for another 3-5 minutes, stirring constantly and ensuring that the bottom isn\u2019t burning. \n6. After it\u2019s cooked for those 3-5 minutes, it\u2019s ready!\n\nDATE & NUT & BEETROOT BALLS\n\nIngredients:\n2 dates\n1/3 cup oats\n1/4 cup walnuts\n2 tsp beetroot powder\n\nInstructions:\n1. Blend the oats and the beetroot powder into a flour using a blender. \n2. Keeping the oats in the blender, add in pitted dates and walnuts. Continue blending. This should create a sticky, combined \u201cdough\u201d\n3. Collect the contents of the blender into a mixing bowl. Pull small pieces off and roll into balls.\n4. Set the balls into a bowl for serving. Sprinkle additional beetroot powder on the balls for color.

{"title": "Eating mostly whole foods plant-based changed my body composition and fixed my gut issues", "selftext": "I'm only 95% plant-based so I hope this isn't an issue. If it is, feel free to delete.\n\nAnyway, I just started a few months ago due to health reasons (autoimmune condition - eczema, gut issues, and hormonal imbalance)\n\nI've been eating mostly legumes, rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and a lot of fruit. And holy crap, what a difference this diet has made in my life.\n\nFirst of all, my gut health hasn't been this good in a while. Antibiotic usage from a few years ago completely destroyed my gut health and I was suffering from a lot of food intolerances but now I've been able to successfully incorporate all those foods back into my diet (nightshades, gluten, grains, etc)\n\nSecond of all, my skin looks amazing now (during the first few weeks I had horrible skin breakouts after reintroducing some foods, but it went away). Now, I haven't had any major eczema flare-ups and the horrible chin acne I've been having on and off for years has completely gone away without any acne medication.\n\nAnd third, I'm at the leanest I've ever been in my life.\n\nI've been pretty active for a while now, but I just haven't been able to shed the fat. I had also been dealing with some hormonal issues, which I suspect was one of the reasons for not being able to shed some fat.\n\nFYI, I'm still currently at the same weight, my body composition just changed. I'm so much leaner now and I can finally see muscle definition.\n\nWhat's crazy is I haven't changed my exercise routine, I actually workout less now, and I even eat a lot of white rice, noodles, and have an occasional junk food binge. Yet the fat is just coming off so easily now!\n\nTaking the plant-based route has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life. And btw, the book Fiber Fueled brought me to this point. So thank you Dr. Will Bulsiewicz! If you haven't read that book yet, go pick it up now! Worth every penny and time.\n\nIf anyone's interested in my journey, here's an article I wrote!\n\n[I Went 95% Plant-Based.

Now Im hundreds of hours of working out in with nothing real to show for it.\n\nSo I quit drinking alcohol, which was a real thing but not as bad as I thought it would be (my body was done with hangovers and begging me to stop), a couple weeks later I changed my breakfast to oats, walnuts, banana and unsweetened soy, delicious. After just a few days I felt amazing. Decided to try it full time.\n\nNow, three months in I\u2019m down 40 lbs, just got my bloodwork done and everything is normal except overall cholesterol which is 120 down from 250 (scary, I know!), blood pressure normal, triglycerides normal, blood sugar normal.

Examples of major modern diseases that are zoonoses include Ebola, salmonellosis, and HIV.\n\nZoonotic diseases are very common, both in the United States and around the world.

{"title": "Morningstar Farms misleads consumers by calling itself plant-based", "selftext": "Last weekend I was served Morningstar Farms sausage by my sister. She was excited to serve me breakfast food that met my needs as a vegan. She saw \u201cTHE POWER OF PLANTS\u201d on the front, and told me it was vegan. Being polite I didn\u2019t want to question her. But later when I checked the ingredients on the box, I realized I\u2019d just eaten eggs and dairy. This was an upsetting experience for me and my family. \n\nLater when I looked into this, I found a lot of conflicting info online about whether or not Morningstar Farms is a vegan-friendly company. \n\nHere\u2019s what I learned. \n\nIn 2019, MorningStar Farms, a subsidiary of Kellogg, made a promise to the public that its products would be fully vegan by 2021. It launched a big media campaign and received a ton of press including feature articles by VegNews, PETA and Vegconomist.\n\nFast forward to 2024, Morningstar Farms now labels itself and its products \u201cplant-based\u201d while still using eggs and dairy in most of them.\n\nThe company has never made a statement explaining its failure to fulfill its promise to go fully vegan by 2021. They don\u2019t respond to comments on social media asking about their vegan pledge. VegNews, PETA and Vegconomist have never published follow up pieces to correct their support of this company\u2019s plant-washing campaign.\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE: Here's Kellanova's response to my letter:\n\n\nThank you for asking when all our MorningStar Farms\u00ae products will become vegan\n\nMost of our MorningStar Farms\u00ae foods are vegan, including Riblets, Chik'n (Patties, Nuggets, Tenders, & Fries), Meatballs, Crumbles, Veggitizers, Corn Dogs, Veggie Dogs, Sausage Patties, Pancake & Sausage on a Stick, and some burgers such as Garden Veggie, Tomato Basil Pizza, and Steakhouse Style burgers.\n\nIf you are curious about our Grillers and Spicy Black Bean burgers, Bacon Strips, or Veggie Breakfast Sausage Links, these recipes are vegetarian and include egg and milk ingredients. Look for the word VEGAN or the Certified Plant-Based logo on our packaging to be sure you're buying a vegan item. \n\nThe foodies worked hard to remove egg and milk ingredients in most of our vegetarian foods. Some recipes were harder to convert than others.\n\nWe understand your interest in converting our vegetarian foods to vegan and will share your feedback with the foodies here at MorningStar Farms. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy our vegan options today, and please stay tuned, as we are always creating new recipes for our vegan fans.\n\nThank you again, Devi, for reaching out to us. We appreciate your interest in MorningStar Farms\u00ae Veggie Sausage Links and hope you have a great day. \n\nIf you have additional concerns or inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are always happy to help. Have a great day!\n\nAll the best,\n\nChristine S.\nConsumer Affairs\nKellanova\n\n--------\n\nIt sounds like they have no plans of following through on their promise to go 100% plant based, after benefiting from all that press.

{"title": "Diabetes: How long to lower fasting glucose?", "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nThis is cross-posted from r/wfpb.  Looking for any guidance and appreciate any input - posting this on behalf of my partner.\n\nMy partner has been fat their entire life and hates going to the doctor. They opted to pay for a blood test with a lab just to check in how they're doing and it looks like they're officially diabetic with a fasting glucose of 358 and an A1c over 13.\n\nThey're adamant about correcting this with lifestyle and committing to a Fuhrman / McDougall / Engine 2 way of eating to get this under control as well as adding muscle to help regulate levels. Medications are an absolute last resort. \n\nSo I want to ask, how long did it take to drop your fasting glucose? What should they be doing right now? Especially if they don't want to go to the doctor and come out with a bunch of prescriptions? What is the absolute line where they need to see a doctor?\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: Thank you, everyone, for your pushes and advice. It really made a difference. A few people said this wasn't being taken seriously or my partner doesn't care about their health and I'd just like to say that's shameful to assume. My partner was scarred, didn't want to be shamed, didn't want to be admitted, and didn't want to learn there was massive damage they didn't know about. Additionally, they didn't want a massive lecture about being another big fat person who is just another uncontrolled diabetic or dealing with disgust from staff. They've had very bad doctor experiences in the past and try to handle shit themselves as a result. \n\nWe tried going to urgent care yesterday since they don't have any symptoms. Urgent care said nope and sent us to the ER. The ER was quick but very confrontational to start about why we were there - when we explained my partner has never had insulin before or a blood test with results like this, it went a bit better. \n\nThey checked their glucose levels and after they had eaten about 4 hours prior their glucose was 237. A bag of IV and 10 units of insulin later, we were discharged with no directions on how to check blood glucose or what to do. Thankfully we have a type 1 diabetic niece so we knew vaguely what to expect and a very helpful pharmacist filled in the gaps. When we got home 3 hours late, we checked their glucose again and it had gone down 10 so it looks like massive insulin resistance. \n\nI'm reading Mastering Diabetes again and they're switching to a McDougall maximum weight loss way of eating. Today we go grocery shopping to buy enough greens and I'm preparing hummus and beans to keep them full. We feel good and are scheduling a primary physician today to follow up. \n\nUPDATE 2: Glucose this morning was 160. Partner exercises for about 30 minutes last night with weights and ate a 50/50 starchy vegetable and greens meal for dinner. No additional insulin.

Finally, I heard MCT oil can accelerate weight loss, but at a BMI of ~20 I'm trying not to lose further weight.

Took vegan blood test at Quest early April; most things were normal but a few were out of range or decreased a lot, so I'd like to focus on stabilizing these:\n\nIRON: 73 (down from 117 in Jan) ug/dL.\nFERRITIN: 33 ng/mL (slightly below range).\n[Notes:]\nI eat lots of lentils and seeds (75-100% RDA before other sources). I'll add frozen kale. I was eating Brad's Salad Snack kale daily but apparently that's only 10% a bag lol.\n\nB6: 34.5 (range max 21.7) ng/mL.\n[Notes:]\nNo idea why B6 is above range. I took multi with high B6 dose for little while in Jan (Life Extension 2-per-day), thought that would've cleared.\n\nB12: 431 (down from 614 in Jan) pg/mL.\n[Notes:]\nNot sure why it dropped so much. Current multivitamin is 50 mcg (2083%), in 2 tabs; I take one before each of 2 meals. Should I crush them? I didn't stop supplements before testing, so presumably B12 would've been even lower than this.\n\nOmegas (started omega pills since last test):\nEPA+DPA+DHA: 4.5% by wt (below range, decreased slightly).\nARACHIDONIC ACID / EPA RATIO: 8.0.\nOMEGA 6/3 RATIO: 8.6.\nOMEGA 3 TOTAL: 4.5%.\nEPA: 0.9%.\nDPA: 1.2%.\nDHA: 2.4%.\nOMEGA 6 TOTAL: 39.1%.\nARACHIDONIC ACID: 7.3 (below range, decreased slightly).\nLINOLEIC ACID: 29.8 (above range).\n\nOther (normal):\nIodine: 72 mcg/L.\nZinc: 70 mcg/dL.\nB1: 163 nmol/L.\nCalcium: 9.7 mg/dL.\nD: 45 ng/mL.\n\nMisc notes: Stable weight and BMI ~20. I feel energetic and healthy.\n\nCurrent supplements and nutrient powders: Jarrow Formulas Men's Multi+, Sports Research Algae Omega 3, each taken twice a day as suggested, but at different meals (I theorize more is absorbed this way overall), just before the meal. I also eat half a scoop of Vega All-In-One nutrient powder in my breakfast cereal; doesn't seem to add much.\n\nGeneral plan: potentially replace current supplements (above) with vegan multivitamin containing, at minimum, B12 (much higher amount), iron, and omega, and no B6. Add frozen kale for additional iron.\n\nFor the replacement supplement, I'm currently deciding among the below 3. (Please feel free to share any other suggestions. My preference is consolidation: everything in one supplement, vs separate pills for vitamins and omegas, for example.)\n\nWHOLIER: https://a.co/d/dVgsRYi\nPROS: Higher iron than other 2; confirmed carrageenan-free; available in Whole Foods.\nCONS: Lower omega than other 2; MCT oil (triglyceride); more expensive.\n\nNEVISS: https://a.co/d/dptqDDa\nPROS: Cheapest, especially after discount; chewable so maybe better absorbed.\nCONS: Unfamiliar brand - trustworthy?\n\nFUTURE KIND: https://a.co/d/79TdtGS\nPROS: Highest omega 3; confirmed carrageenan-free.\nCONS: Missing iron and a few others; I doubt I need 400 mcg B12 daily.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1k8dyzv/plantbased_blood_test_at_4_mos_what_to_change/", "created_utc": 1745677010.0, "score": 4, "author": "aryanmsh", "num_comments": 43, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1k8dyzv/plantbased_blood_test_at_4_mos_what_to_change/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I typically have high energy - up early to exercise before work, then a few hours of school after work, winding down at a reasonable time. I practice a lot of self-maintenance and am overall healthy. \n\nWent to Urgent Care last week after trying to exercise and feeling like I was going to pass out and couldn't breathe right.

They told me to get with my primary doctor for more tests, or ER if things got worse.   \n  \nI've since had blood work done and some of my iron levels are off, my vitamin d is too low, and my white blood cell count is too low. I have an appointment next week to see my Dr in person but in the interim when she reviewed my lab results, she just said my iron levels were \"slightly low\" and that's about all. Before I see her again, I want to cover all my bases but I'm curious if there's something else I'm lacking or if anyone else has experienced something similar.\n\nI do make a concerted effort to get all the nutrients I need.

I grabbed the attending physician & asked why if they knew she ate only WFPB, they had been failing to supplement B-12, D3, Omega 3/6/9, iodine & magnesium. He looked at me blankly when I said that proper nutrition was vital, if not more so, than the meds they were pumping in her. I asked the medical staff whether I could start bringing in what she needed. The answer, unsurprisingly, was \u201cnope\u201d - they had to control all intakes. \nSoon after that, a nurse came in with the supplements I had been requesting.

I'm in a place where I'd like to invest in my health AND my ethics. Here's my problem - I'm hungry!! I usually start th day with a highish protein breakfast (smoothie with protein powder, tofu scramble, greek plant yogurt and granola). I have a tendency to forget to eat or eat a really light lunch. This is in part due to poor hunger queues but also because I don't know what to eat!\n\nThis is ESPECIALLY and issue on days where I workout. I rock climb. I often find myself ravenous in the late afternoon on days I climb, even when I follow the workout with protein (20 grams minimum). I also cycle to work and work a pretty active job. This activity level has a tendency to create insatiable hunger which causes me to turn to high calorie density processed foods (which is okay *sometimes* but not on a daily basis!)\n\nThis is where y'all come in. I am interested in acquiring some filling wfpb lunch and dinner ideas. Searching online has often resulted in underflavored, low protein, low calorie (like 300 for a meal yikes!!) meals.  I'm also curious what y'all eat for snacks. Snacks are the one thing I either over or undereat for every time. It'll either be something like a bunch of tortilla chips and salsa or ten baby carrots. I need ideas better than \"handful of pistacios.\" My hope too is that if I eat more filling meals I won't need to snack as much.. \n\nI have very few dislikes. I love beans, tofu, tempeh (my favorite I think), lentils, seitan, etc. I also love basically all produce except raw arugula. I have no known allergies but live with someone who is extremely allergic to hemp so I do not buy it. I understand that this is a commonly asked question but my searching has not yet yielded adequate results so I thought I'd ask!\n\nEDITED to add the bit about working out! I forgot it lol\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1jo8gpi/hungry_for_lunch/", "created_utc": 1743441286.0, "score": 8, "author": "Kill_the_worms", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1jo8gpi/hungry_for_lunch/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Both knees, hip, shoulder and elbow.  Aches and pains everywhere.  Failed DMARDS (zero effect) and given my inflammation markers were stupid crazy, was placed on biologicals.  Humira failed and then Simponi finally worked.  Swelling reduced, baker\u2019s cysts gone and pain manageable.  Happy Chappy:).\nBut in my blood work I couldn\u2019t ever get CRP and others down to safe levels.  This caught up with me eventually and I started getting chest pains, failed a stress test and CT + echo picked up major blockages.  After a lot of research I decided on the low oil, whole food plant based approach by Caldwell Esselstyn (Fork over knives dude) which has great success in Cardiovascular patients.\nI had a 6 week gap before undergoing an angioplasty for 2 or 3 stents.  So I gave the diet a go 100%.\nStarted to really feel well after about 4 weeks.  Could walk without any shoulder or arm pain.  Then I went in for my full blood work for the Cardiologist (and Rheumatologist) and got a massive shock.  I was so focused on the heart that I didn\u2019t realise my PA had basically become nonexistent.  All markers went to almost zero.  Rheumatologist was like \u201cwow, who\u2019s diet\u201d?.  Finally my PA was in a good spot (touch wood it holds) for the first time.\nBigger shock came next.  Blood pressure was normally 140-150/85.  Now 110/75. No meds.\nCholesterol down by 60% (tried statin but had side effects.  But it may have contributed due to long half life).

And was able to fairly easily drop to a 26 BMI with portion control of the my Whole Foods diet. The weight loss helped to control my hypertension. I so to say 'let myself go' due to a move, and my BMI crept up to almost 27 (and I was enjoying a normal life things - eating out, weekly a couple alcohol drinks, etc...) but still generally eating very healthy (compared to standard American diet) and still strength training & moderate exercise 3 times a week. My hypertension kicked back in, and I felt like crap. I upped my exercise routine and started cleaning up those loose ends in my diet (and am taking a small does of lisinopril now). In a month of Whole Foods, added exercise, and portion control, I very easily once again dropped my BMI to 25.8 now (a full point down) and even though I'm still on the low dose hypertension medicine, my BP has been 110/60 for a couple weeks solidly now\n\nI wanted to move towards Whole Foods, Plant Based for the additional health benefits that my Whole Foods diet lacks. \n\nBut I HATE beans. Lentils, chickpeas (unless its hummus), mung.... I've tried and hated so far. In Whole foods, I've had black beans as a side, seasoned with cumin, and liked those. But otherwise.... I just can't find beans appealing! And on top of it, the recipes I've been trying for WFPB have been higher in sodium. I tend to do best trying a meal plan so I can just follow something without thought at first - to get me inspired - so tried a Broccoli Mum meal plan. The meals have been VERY filling, extremely so. And other than the beans, tasty. But higher sodium and I'm seeing my BP rising again, even with removing some of the sodium from the recipes (low sodium soy sauce, flat out not adding the salt to so recipes, etc ..) but it's still too much, and my BP seems to rising the last couple days since really diving into this WFPB (125/75). So not high BP, but it's been rising, which concerns me to continue WFPB as WF I had this under control. \n\nI still feel good (physically and mentally), and full.

{"title": "How to stop the spiral?", "selftext": "So I went WFPB last October and it was like a switch went off in my brain. For some reason, it was super easy to do. I went cold turkey with soft drinks, processed foods and sugar (only had maple/date syrup in very small amounts, and fruit). Previously when I've tried to change my diet, I've felt hungry and it was a struggle and gave up after a few weeks, but for some reason, this time around, it just clicked. \n\nI was doing really well. Had a bit of fatigue after about three weeks, but stuck with it and it went away. Exercise also became easy and I actually craved it. I've lost 14kg and have been really positive. \n\nHowever, the last two weeks it feels like that brain switch has been flicked off. I've had no motivation to exercise and this weekend I've had a real 'eff it' attitude to diet. I even had a shanklish pizza from a local Lebanese bakery (one of my fave treats prior to wfpb) and some takeaway fried rice with egg because I was craving comfort food at the end of an exhausting week. I'm stuck with weight loss and keep bouncing around between 104 and 107kg. \n\nLast week, I was gentle with myself and said, \"It's ok. This happens. Let's get up on Monday morning and do that morning walk that you've been avoiding and pack a nice healthy lunch and start afresh\". But by Thursday I was back in the doldrums. I'm super hungry, and craving the 'bad' comfort foods I've had no interest in for months. \n\nHas anyone been in this position? Did you come up with any strategies to shake yourself out of it?

{"title": "From Keto to Low Fat Vegan", "selftext": "Hi. I'm writing to you because you might be interested in my nutritional \"experiment\". For the past 4 months I've been on a very strict keto diet (I ate less than 20g of carbs), I measured my ketones with a blood meter (sometimes they were even above 3, so high), so I was almost constantly in ketosis.\n\nInitially I also added intermittent fasting to the keto diet, 16-18 hours without food. I wasn't terribly obese but I was slightly overweight. I started losing weight quickly (understandably, I cut out almost all carbs) and initially felt pretty good - lots of energy.\n\nOnce I lost most of my belly fat I started losing energy, feeling increasingly tired, and keeping my ketone levels high without eating absurd amounts of fat was difficult.\n\nI like reading about diets, medicine, etc. and I was never a keto fanatic. I knew well that consuming that much saturated fat was very risky.\n\nI used the keto diet mainly because of its possible positive effect on depression (I have been suffering from depression for many years).\n\nIn the last month on a diet I felt worse and worse. My mood was getting worse, I felt weaker and weaker, and when I got home from work I had to take a nap because my eyes would close by themselves. \n\nIn addition, I began to notice more and more disturbing symptoms from the digestive system. My bowel movements (which were never great) became less frequent. After eating fat, my stomach was bothering me more and more. In recent days, I felt nausea and a loud sloshing in my stomach and intestines that tipped the scales and I decided to give up the diet.\n\nHowever, while on the keto diet, I have learned a few healthy habits that I would like to stick to. For example, I have completely given up sugar and simple carbohydrates.\n\nSince I consider eating meat and dairy unhealthy, I decided to switch to a vegan diet, but... and here's a surprise: very low-fat. (from one extreme to another, that's how I am).\n\nI will not eat fatty plant foods (like seeds, nuts, avocados and olives - I'm sick of them on keto...), I will not add fat to my meals. I think that plant foods have some fat in them anyway, which should be enough for the body to function. My diet will be a bit like the Ornish diet, except for the egg whites and low-fat dairy.\n\nI am very curious how the body will react and function after returning to carbohydrates and depriving it of excess fat. If you are also interested, I will write about mine in a while.\n\nI'm on day 4 of this diet and so far returning to carbohydrates has been a good decision. My mood has improved (the keto diet deprives the body of serotonin and dopamine), I sleep much better (on keto I slept even 10-12 hours and I wasn't fully regenerated and interestingly I didn't have dreams - now they're back), as if my brain has returned to normal.

{"title": "Self-made nutmilk in coffee tastes awful, what can I do?", "selftext": "I recently got into making my own nutmilk because I want to use less store-bought Oatly Barista. I use a regular espresso maker for the stove and like to use much milk to mellow out the bitterness and acidity from the espresso.\n\nI did everything that was recommended to avoid it curdling from the acidity of my coffee (heating up the milk and also using sodium bicarbonate to make the coffee less acidic) and it technically worked well.\n\nSo far, I tried pure cashew milk with sunflower oil, cashew milk with coconut cream, and almond milk with just a little bit of coconut cream for the taste.\n\nI used soy lecithin to emulsify the fat content (sunflower oil, fat from coconut cream).\n\nBut unfortunately, I didn\u2019t like the taste at all. I usually only drink Oatly Barista since it\u2019s creamy and doesn\u2019t leave a weird aftertaste like the majority of the brands I\u2019ve tried over the years. I like how Oatly somehow completes the flavour of my coffee in a way that no other plant milk has done so far - it doesn\u2019t overpower the coffee taste, but rather mellows out the bitterness and acidity without taking too much of the aroma away.\n\nBut my nutmilk\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I like the taste of it on its own; if I drink it pure or eat cereal with it it\u2019s delicious. But the almond milk got somehow really gross when I heated it up, it had like a slimy texture and it split (even though I added soy lecithin) and my coffee tasted watery and bitter at the same time with all the recipes I've tried.\n\nI missed the creaminess and richness even though my nutmilk contained fat, and so I am wondering what exactly in plant milk does that for coffee? Do I need a kind of protein content? Do I have to add something else? I'd really like to try hazelnut milk next.\n\nBtw, I also tried Guar Gum once as a stabiliser, but I didn\u2019t like the consistency at all, it tasted more slimy than creamy. If you have ever tried the Coconut Barista Milk from Alpro, you might know what I mean - the taste is great, but the consistency feels off, like it was artificially stabilised (though they used Gellan, not Guar Gum).\n\nSomebody told me soy lecithin may prevent the milk from foaming, but tbh, that\u2019s not so important to me. The taste and consistency is what matters - I want my latte to taste great, not look great. ;)\n\nI already made a post in the vegan subreddit and there are a lot of nutmilk specialists there, but I didn\u2019t get the info I need - they seem content with their coffee, but I am picky and want it to taste right to me. The coffee subreddit didn\u2019t allow my post since it wasn\u2019t deemed substantial.\n\nI know this is a very particular question, but I am deep in the nutmilk rabbit hole now and I want to crack the code of creamy plant-based milk that works with coffee and that I can make at home.\n\nIf anyone has some advice for me, I'd be very grateful!\n\nUPDATE: \n\nFor anyone who\u2019s interested, I made hazelnut milk today and it\u2019s really good in coffee! I used ~150g if roasted peeled hazelnuts (soaked over night) for about 800ml of Water, a tbsp of cashew butter, a pinch of salt, a tiny amount of rice syrup, a tsp vanilla, 3 tbsp of sunflower oil and one tsp of soy lecithin. \n\nI heated it up and it doesn\u2019t get slimy like my almond milk and it goes very well as a Latte made with much milk and an espresso. So finally, a success :) It\u2019s less creamy than the cashew coconut milk but that doesn\u2019t bother me since the taste is so great and it complements the coffee aroma without needing to be super rich. The flavour of the roasted hazelnuts is absolutely amazing. \n\nI used a high speed blender and a nut milk bag. \n\nI'll try macadamia next!

{"title": "Chicken slip up please help", "selftext": "Context: I was raised vegetarian and other than a few weeks of a pescatarian phase when I was about 10 I\u2019ve never eaten meat in my life. Ever. No slip ups with anything not even untraceable things like broth or gelatine. I always check im always \u2018crazy\u2019 and \u2018extra\u2019 about it but I have NEVER had a slip up (that I\u2019m aware of obviously) but seriously never. Other vegetarians seem very casual to me about it they are okay with gelatine, collagen or will indulge in a small amount of meat for a special occasion. While I would never judge someone for this, I have always considered myself on the very very extreme side of being vegetarian compared to others in the community. I live with my dad who eats meat and prepares some of my meals and he is especially careful to not have any cross- contamination or anything and the same with my boyfriend who is also an avid meat-eater. About a year ago my mum (who raised me as vegetarian but like I mentioned is a little less serious- eats gelatine ect) offered me a chocolate that was branded as healthy and claimed to have collagen in it on the package, I handed it back to her and said it has collagen, she then read the packaging out loud and told me it was \u2018coconut collagen\u2019. I was a little less educated on supplements then but I knew that there were ways to have ingredients that promoted collagen that weren\u2019t necessarily actual collagen, and she just told me it was completely vegan so I ate it. Few days later she was having another one and I read the packaging which turned out to have read coconut, collagen. I didn\u2019t get mad at her or blame her I simply informed her and she apologised and said she read it wrong. Skip to now, she brought home two burritos, one was already half eaten that was supposed to be for her and one unwrapped one for me but she claimed that she thought the one she was eating has egg and fake meat which she doesn\u2019t like so she told me to eat hers and proceeded to watch me eat most of it before eating hers. Towards being finish I pulled out what I thought looked like chicken and asked her if it was, she told me it was fake meat again but I insisted it looked like chicken and looked at their website and the burrito she got \u2018for herself\u2019 which she gave me had chicken but the one she was actually eating was completely vegan. After that I just told her I needed space from her to think but I wasn\u2019t mad, she\u2019s insisted that there is no reason to be mad and im not acting mad toward her but im fucking fuming. Even if she didn\u2019t make the first mistake she was more careless about it than all the meat eaters in my life. And I genuinely think im going into a depression after eating it, ik it might sound dramatic to some people but not eating meat is a pillar of who I am and this has completely crushed me I feel like I don\u2019t want to live.

For now I'm just taking over the menu from the guy who had to leave for family reasons. It's full of typical cafeteria junky food, although mixed with some wholesome foods too.\n\nIt's a progressive enough community that I think the parents will be supportive. In the summer, students work with the community garden to teach the kids about where food comes from.\n\nI've been given free reign for next year and I'd love to revamp the whole menu to be whole food plant based.\n\nProblem is, at home I'm all about one pot stews and soups, salads, and grazing on simple snacks. I have no idea where to start!!!\n\nI want the school menu to be so fun and tasty for the kids that they won't even notice it's not chicken fingers and pizza. Maybe, dare I hope, to even like it so much they go home and get their parents excited to try some new meals? (Maybe have recipes available?)\n\nWe have great volunteers but this will be new for them. And I'm not experienced enough at large scale cooking to easily scale up recipes.\n\nSo I need help!\n\nEDIT: I may not have been clear that it's only one lunch a week at a school in Canada, where the whole \"cafeteria thing\" isn't like in the US or UK. No breakfast, no dessert, no drinks; one hot entree, a piece of fruit, and sometimes a side like biscuits or salad.\n\nThe hot lunch program is run by a local non-profit community health organization (which is my employer, not the school board) and funded directly by the parents who opt-in to the program in September after reviewing the menu. Parents can opt out if the menu doesn't suit their kids' palate, and send them with lunch that day.\n\nMy understanding is the program used to be entirely whole foods, mostly seasonal and sourced from local farms. I'm not clear how or why that changed but I'll look into it. My point being there's precedent for the \"healthy\" aspect. Plant based might be a tougher sell, but then it's only one meal a week and no one's forced into it.\n\nWhen I say progressive rural community, I mean the island is mostly West Coast hippies and organic farmers. I imagine there are more parents currently opting out because it's junky, than would because it's too healthy.\n\nAll that being said, I really appreciate the feedback to get the administration on board. There's a strong PAC (parent advisory committee) and the principal is really down to earth. So I think it's totally doable to get them on board and in support.\n\nI'm also willing to do a junky menu once a month, to emphasize these foods are to be eaten exceptionally for fun, not regularly for sustenance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i3bg73/im_the_new_lunch_lady_help_us_go_wfpb/", "created_utc": 1737100452.0, "score": 86, "author": "Schrodingers_Ape", "num_comments": 39, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i3bg73/im_the_new_lunch_lady_help_us_go_wfpb/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "meal delivery services roundup & quick healthiness evals from WFPB perspective", "selftext": "There have been several threads on meal delivery services for plant-based meals here and on other WFPB subs but they all seem to miss many options. Here's a roundup of every one I could find offering ready-to-eat meals, with a quick good vs bad evaluation of the healthiness of the current menu of each one in terms of conforming to WFPB guidelines (as exemplified by Greger, Ornish, & similar proponents).\n\nThis was a big process in which I analyzed the ingredients list & entered the nutrition info for a half dozen or more menu items of each into a spreadsheet to calculate things like fat % and fiber ratio to calories. The most common problems are too much fat, use of oil, added sweeteners, and/or refined grains.\n\n* Whole Harvest: Website shows it as operating again after a recent 2024 pause. Good: Everything no-oil. Most stuff no added sugars. Several SOS-free options (& menu filterable by this). Min 8 items per shipment but can choose all 8 individually (from 16 entree options + 2 breakfast + 2 snacks/desert this week). Bad: Some items have added sugars. Some use refined grains, eg couscous & pearl barley. Ingredients not listed in decreasing order of amount (confirmed with their customer service), so can't tell how much eg refined grains there are if any listed anywhere in ingredients. Some items have more fat and/or protein than recommended by folks like Ornish, Greger, Longo, etc. (This is hard to avoid though, and this service seems to be lower than most.)\n* Vegin Out: Can order the weekly vegan menu but not pick individual dishes. This week's has 3 entrees + 4 sides. Good: Mostly oil free, low sugar, low sodium. Bad: Added sugars not broken out separately in nutrition info. Includes maple syrup, refined grains (eg, not-whole-grain noodles) & white potatoes. Costs more for shipping outside of California. All-or-nothing ordering.\n* First Seed:\u00a0Indian. Good: Entirely plant-based. No oil. No added sugars. Low fat. High fiber. Bad: It's really only 6 dishes, 4 of which are mainly legumes (beans or lentils), 1 of which has white (basmati) rice as 1st ingredient. So only 1 has veggies & lacks refined grains, and this one is sold out for the next half-year. The legume dishes are high in protein if judged by themselves but they could be used as sauces with legumes in them by combining them with veggies & whole grains. Indian may not be enough variety of ethnicity for some. Looks like it ships less often than weekly.\n* Sprinly: 6 items listed for this week. Good: No refined sugars (narrowly defined, see below). Claims to keep oil to a minimum & has some clearly marked oil-free items. Can see future week's menu items. Bad: Still uses oil. Though no refined sugars, does use near equivalents like maple syrup. Some use of refined grains. Overall fat % higher than common recs and higher than Whole Harvest (several items 20-36% fat), probably mostly due to the oil.\n* LeafSide: Freeze-dried meals---just add (hot) water. Just considered the savory bowls. Good: No oil, no added sugars, no refined grains (though white potatoes were used in a few dishes). SOS-free available by request. Bad: Too much fat in most dishes. Freeze-dried food causes bloating for some people.\n* Planted Table\u00a0(SF Bay area): Good: Vegan, natural ingredients. Bad: Incomplete nutrition info (eg fiber not listed, added sugars not listed). Incomplete ingredients lists (eg \"creamy salsa dressing\" not expanded). Too much fat. (Only checked first 6 menu items, and all had too much except lettuce wraps.) Refined grains & sweeteners (white bread, white rice, molasses).\u00a0\n* Purple Carrot: Good: Many options. Bad: Lots of oil. High in fat. Low fiber. Lots of use of refined grains (white bread, white rice, refined pasta).\n* Daily Harvest: Looked at the \"heart healthy\" bowls, appropriate for lunch or dinner.\u00a0Good: Many options. No added sugars. Bad: Lots of oil. Lots of fat. Not enough fiber.\n* Thistle: Good: Has plant-based versions of everything. Bad: Not enough fiber. Too much oil. Too much fat.\n* Fire Road: Plant-based in the sense of not using meat sourced from animals but most meals still meat-centric recipes using lab-grown meat (eg Beyond) or plant-based meat-substitutes like soy-curls. Seems to lean in a keto / fitness direction philosophically rather than a WFPB direction. Many menu items high fat, and high protein seems to be a goal.\n* Methodology: Not entirely plant-based and the vegan lunch/dinner options mostly seem like meat dishes with tempeh or tofu substituted for the meat. Good: They have several vegan options. Bad: Added sugars not specified. Lots of oil. The 1 menu item I looked at had high fat and protein.\n* Sakara: Nutrition info not provided for menu items, so can't evaluate. Many aspects sound good: plant-rich, lots of greens, nutritient density, etc. Free of meat, dairy, refined sugars, etc.\n* HungryRoot: Can't see menu at all. Tried long quiz but then wanted me to sign up before showing me anything else.\n* MamaSezz: No longer seems to provide read-to-eat fresh meals. Only prepackaged snacks now.\n\nI didn't include links to the services but each is easy to find via websearch.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i0isfw/meal_delivery_services_roundup_quick_healthiness/", "created_utc": 1736788017.0, "score": 9, "author": "kpfleger", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i0isfw/meal_delivery_services_roundup_quick_healthiness/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "So Confused WFPB vs Paleo/Keto", "selftext": "I'm so confused by all the information providing contrasting conclusions about what is healthy.

I've read about fermenting, soaking, sprouting, and cooking to destroy or reduce \"antinutrients\" but I hadn't been doing any of those things (other than cooking obviously) until now.

I've been eating fairly well: a protein powder smoothie for breakfast with peanut butter, chia seeds, blueberries, oats; lunch I'd have a buddha bowl with quinoa, sweet potato, edamame beans, chickpeas, etc; and for dinner, I'd usually just have a pasta or something and if I have space another protein shake.

{"title": "Fermented Chickpea and Cicerchia Stew with Sourdough Bread Made from Spelt and Fermented Red Lentils", "selftext": "Both the stew and the bread were well done, enjoyed by all who tasted it, and I think they were tasty too. On the point of fermentation, I like to lacto-ferment cooking ingredients - or even most of them - as fermentation can significantly enrich the flavour and also aid the absorption of nutrients. Of course, you can also simply make the recipe with soaked legumes and the dish will be very tasty. Plus, chicheria is little known in many places, but it is a super legume. If not available, feel free to use other legumes or even just chickpeas.\n\nIngredients for the stew:\n\n- 200 g chickpeas (dry)\n- 200 g cicerchias (dry)\n- 400 g zucchini\n- 400 g soy sour cream\n- 4-5 cloves of garlic (or 1 tbsp garlic powder)\n- 1 medium onion (or 1 tbsp onion powder)\n- 3-4 medium carrots\n- 1-2 medium banana peppers\n- 1 large tomato\n- 3-4 bay leaves\n- 2 tbsp. paprika\n- half tsp. grounded black pepper\n- 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar\n- chives to taste\n- parsley to taste\n- basil to taste\n- salt to taste\n\nThe first step is to make the soy sour cream sauce the day before cooking, then leave it in the fridge overnight to allow the flavours to blend. This means mixing the red pepper, herbs, pepper and a little salt into the soy sour cream. You can also add other ground spices to the mix, such as cumin or garlic powder, onion powder or tomato powder. Cover the sauce airtight and refrigerate it. Take the sauce out of the fridge long enough before cooking so that it is not too cold when you gradually mix it with the other ingredients.\n\nSaut\u00e9 the chopped onion and garlic in a pressure cooker on low heat with a little water. When the chickpeas and cicerchias have been saut\u00e9ed, add them to the pot. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the ingredients by a cm and a half. Add the bay leaves, cover the pressure cooker and cook on high setting over maximum heat until it sizzles. When the whistle blows, turn the heat down to low and cook the contents of the pressure cooker for 40 minutes - if you are using non-lacto-fermented soaked legumes, 15-20 minutes is sufficient, but the exact time will depend on the pressure cooker. After 40 minutes, turn off the heat and wait for the pressure cooker to release all the steam.\n\nMeanwhile, in a pot, start steaming the chopped zucchini, carrots, banana pepper and tomatoes. When all the vegetables are almost tender, add the ingredients from the pressure cooker to the pot and let the ingredients cook together.\n\nReduce the heat to low, then add the sauce from the fridge and the balsamic vinegar to the pot. Stir the sauce slowly and thoroughly into the contents of the pot to prevent it from clumping. Let the stew cook for a little while, but only until it doesn't want to stick to the bottom of the pot. Then turn off the heat, stir the stew well and salt it to taste at the very end of cooking.\n\nIngredients for the bread:\n\n- 300 g wholemeal spelt flour\n- 200 g lacto-fermented red lentils\n- 50 g rye sourdough starter (50% hydration)\n- 500-550 ml water\n- 10 g salt\n\nThe lacto-fermented red lentils need to be blended with enough water to obtain a pleasant pancake batter-like consistency. Mix the dough with wholemeal spelt flour and add enough water to make the dough as thick as a dense but runny cream. This gives about 500-550 ml of water.\n\nAt this point, the dough is divided into two equal parts, one half goes into a jar and goes into the fridge. The other half remains in the mixing bowl, to which you add the sourdough starter and salt.\n\nCover the dough in the mixing bowl with an airtight lid and let it rest at room temperature for 2-3 hours. After that it goes into the fridge. The next day half of the saved dough in the jar is added and left again at room temperature for 2-3 hours, then it goes back into the fridge. The next day, feed the remaining dough in the same way as the day before, then put the dough back to the fridge. The next day, the dough should be left at room temperature for 2-3 hours before baking, after which the bread is ready to be baked.\n\nI started the baking at 210\u00b0C with a 10-minute cover, and then continued baking uncovered at 190\u00b0C for the remaining 25-30 minutes. Once the bread has cooled, you are ready to slice it.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ye81hnnha7be1.png", "created_utc": 1736093897.0, "score": 74, "author": "Amgarrak", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1huaitw/fermented_chickpea_and_cicerchia_stew_with/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Anyone else find family the hardest part?", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nMy husband and I have been (mostly) plant based for about 9 months. We still eat animal products a few times a month, mostly where it coincides with our social lives since WFPB is not always consistently an option everywhere. \n\nIn addition, we try to avoid processed foods. So in short, it's a good thing I love cooking, because I spend a good amount of time each week meal prepping largely from scratch. \n\nDespite this being work, I don't find the commitment that bad. I enjoy it, catch up on audiobooks, and cook in bulk to freeze and eat later. \n\nHowever, especially with the holidays + many family birthdays this month, I'm starting to get exasperated. We are from the Midwest, and our families are your standard meat and potatoes stock. Whole I don't expect anyone to cater to us, I am finding navigating this season very emotionally taxing for several reasons:\n\n- The events are often not \"potluck\" style, and on occasion when I've brought my own plant based dish it's viewed as rude\n\n- Events are often planned spontaneously or last minute, meaning I have minimal time to prep something (ex. Today we got 36 hr notice for a b-day party serving all meat Chinese takeout or processed freezer Chinese). So tonight, due to time constraints, I had to choose between getting a workout in or trying to throw something together quick that I can eat and others can try/share. \n\n- When I bring stuff to share, it often gets picked at and we bring most of it home, which means I spent more time preparing than needed. But if I ever bring a portioned out meal just for me/husband, comments get made about not sharing or being generous. It feels like we can't win either way. \n\n- Basically none of our families understand our view point or are extremely prone to fad diets, commenting on people's bodies, etc., so when people inevitably ask questions about what we brought and why, it feels like entering a discussion minefield. In the past, simply explaining my dietary preference when questioned has led to people commenting on my weight, etc, which is tough as I have a history of an ED. \n\n- Everybody says \"It's okay to indulge sometimes.\" Yes it is, but rarely a week goes but that multiple reasons to indulge don't occur! And trust me, I do, on the things I want and enjoy the most. But people act like showing any restraint is \"not letting yourself enjoy life\" UGH \n\nI could go on, but just curious if anyone else feels the same. We feel like we have an opportunity to lead and educate others, but sometimes it's so damn lonely and frustrating just to try and take care of yourself.

Sometimes I will use other nut butters to mix it up. \n* Yogurt: I'll use usually one of the no sugar added Kite Hill yogurts with whatever fruit I have (generally berries or bananas), a mix of seeds I have (flaxseed, chia seed, hemp hearts), and then a crunchy topping. Lately my goto has been grapenuts (a whole grain cereal).\n* Cereal: Soy milk (the green Silk is my favorite) with a whole grain cereal. Lately plain shredded wheat has been my go to, sometimes mixed with grapenuts. I occasionally add fruit but usually have it just like this.\n* Pancakes/waffles. Made with whole grain flour and oats. I make a big batch and then heat them up throughout the week. I add cinnamon and they are tasty plain, but sometimes I add a bit of yogurt on to them like butter.\n\n# Meals:\n* Tofu and rice bowls are my favorite. I will air fry tofu, and have brown rice. Sometimes I'll mix it with another grain like buckwheat or quinoa or other types of whole rice. I'll generally add some beans (usually just canned), some sort of green (like spinach or lettuce), a sauce (like hummus or shuug), and something crunchy on top (usually something chickpea based from the Indian grocer). I eat these for lunch most days with whatever combination we have available. Sometimes instead of tofu I will have air fryer falafel.\n* Tacos: I use corn tortillas. Can use lots of different veggies. Sometimes I use tofu, sometimes soy curls, sometimes just crispy potatoes and mushrooms. If I go for veggies I'll usually make a protein rich sauce like with silken tofu. Fresh salsa is also a plus. Sometimes I will use arepas instead. I get arepas and tortillas that are basically just corn and heat them in the air fryer.\n* \"Shrimp and grits\" inspired flavors where I will have grits or polenta with seasoned soy curls and beans on top. Also good with corn on the cob on the side.\n* Pasta dishes with whole grain or chickpea pasta with some other goodness added in. Tomato based ones, \"white\" ones made with cashews, etc.\n* Curries, especially those made with whole cashews and lentils for flavor. Usually with brown rice, sometimes I mix it with pasta to remix it later!\n* Also lots and lots of different types of soups. Chili, minestrone, various veggie stews, etc. They also go really well with cornbread, which I make with whole grain cornmeal. \n\n# Veggies\nThese go with the meals depending, but here are some veggies I've discovered I love now:\n\n* Brussel sprouts\n* Asparagus\n* I love lightly sauteed greens. Some favorites this way include kale greens, bok choy, broccolini. \n* Okra\n\nI used to like mushrooms, broccoli, green beans, and some others I still eat but I keep finding new ones I like. I try to get a new one to try pretty often, especially if I go to a grocery store with a more diverse selection. \n\nAlso, don't be afraid of potatoes and yams. There are so many good and healthy ways you can make them! \n\n# Meat substitutes\nMeat adds savoriness and it adds a more protein and fat rich foot to your plate. Except occasionally when out I don't do the reconstruction meats like Beyond Meat. My favorite things are tofu and soy curls. Soy curls are based on the whole soy bean. Tofu there are many kinds, and I sometimes will have non-soy based tofu when eating with a family member allergic to soy (usually fava bean based because it is available at my main grocery store, but I've also have pumpkin seed and chickpea/burmese tofu). \n\nBut lots of beans and lentils will also fill that niche, so I also will use those heavily throughout my diet! \n\nMushrooms are also good from a flavor perspective, but they don't have the same nutrition as meat. Mushrooms can be added to a dish to make it a lot more savory though. \n\n# Snacks:\n* Crackers (my favorite is Wasa Crispbread) with nut butter or hummus or something similar. \n* Chia seed pudding: mix chia seeds, soy milk, vanilla, and a little maple syrup. I've also done a pudding with blended silken tofu which is really good. \n* Fruit. I eat lots of fruit, especially after meals. My favorite right now for snacking are pears, granny smith apples, and mandarins.\n* Veggies and hummus. Favorites for this include celery, sweet peppers, carrots, and cauliflower. \n* Also I snack on fresh bread a lot. \n\n# Desserts\nSometimes I do make desserts. Here are some that are fairly low sugar/oil and can be quite good!\n\n* I make a lightly sweetened pumpkin dish that is basically like the inside of a pumpkin pie with less sugar. Canned pumpkin + a little bit of whole grain flour + plant milk + cinnamon are the main ingredients. Sometimes I add sugar free dark chocolate nibs. \n* Oatmeal \"cookie\" drops: Oatmeals + dates + maybe some nuts. You can make a similar one with bananas and oats too.\n\n# Eating out\nI try to avoid eating out too much. I typically go for Chipoltle/Moe's, Cava, or bowl places like Bowlero or Fresh Greens when I do eat out. The other go to are Thai, Indian, and Mediterranean restaurants which I find a little easier to find good options at. With Thai you have to worry about fish sauce if you are concerned about being vegan, with Indian you have to be careful about milk, and in all you have to be careful about too much oil, which is a tradeoff I am willing to make when eating out. I did do some travelling this year and went to places with lots of vegan options (NYC and UK were the big trips), but it was hard to fit into more whole foods in this time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hmphb2/my_favorite_foods_after_a_year_on_a_plant_based/", "created_utc": 1735223520.0, "score": 264, "author": "et-pengvin", "num_comments": 36, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hmphb2/my_favorite_foods_after_a_year_on_a_plant_based/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I have stretches where I go hard in the paint and stretches where I fall off the wagon and eat pizza like it\u2019s a requirement for health. It\u2019s never meat just cheese but way too much cheese. \n\nIt\u2019s June 2023 and I have a blood test. Not good. Total cholesterol - 274, triglycerides - 97 (okay trig is not bad), and LDL - 215. However my fasting glucose is a shiny 84. This is my hard on again hard off again phase. However I am on it. I go pretty low fat 10% - 15%, high carb. Lots of grains, beans, veggies, and tons of fruit. \n\nIt\u2019s now July of 2023. Been going hard for a month, time to test. Total cholesterol - 229, triglycerides - 139 (big jump), LDL - 166. Glucose is a less shiny but still decent 91.  \n\nI go back to on again off again because I can\u2019t seem to stay satisfied in my diet. It\u2019s more on again than off again, however. Fast forward I get a new doctor in September of this year and we test. Total cholesterol - 247, triglycerides - 134, LDL - 178. Glucose is still normal but barely at 99. Doctor is unhappy and is not having it and I\u2019m not happy either. I\u2019m put on a statin, and I really want to kick it into overdrive so I do the portfolio diet. \n\nFrom sept until today, my average diet is breakfast - 140 g tofu, 150 g hummus, 200 g broccoli, 200 g brussels sprouts. Lunch - 500 g cantaloupe, 30 g walnuts. Snack - 28 g natural pb and four slices of Ezekiel bread or 100 g (uncooked weight) red lentils with about 150 g combined broccoli/brussels sprouts . Dinner - 80 g oatmeal, 12 g flax seed, 15 g, date syrup, 100 g wild blueberries, and 1/2 cup of soy milk. All in all roughly 1900 calories, with an average of 249 total carbs, 55 g fiber, 80 g fat, and 93 g of protein. \n\nToday I test and get my lab results back. Total cholesterol - 154, triglycerides - 90, and LDL - 98. Not too shabby right? Here\u2019s the kicker, glucose - 110. Why can\u2019t I get it right? My cholesterol is coming down nicely but my fasting glucose is increasing at a concerning pace. \n\nTLDR, 15 months mostly WFPB 75/25. When on the diet, high carb low fat 10 - 15% fat) Cholesterol was never in acceptable levels but fasting glucose was great. However never really felt satisfied. \n\n3.5 months on portfolio diet and statin, my cholesterol is coming down to pretty decent levels but my fasting glucose is rising sharply. However, I am almost always satisfied. Do I stay on the higher fat diet (35% - 40%) and hope glucose comes down or is it triggering the sharp rise in glucose even though my cholesterol is basically at record low levels? Can you get both down at the same time? \n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hn4y7z/what_am_i_doing_wrong/", "created_utc": 1735267331.0, "score": 9, "author": "SignaturePatient4844", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hn4y7z/what_am_i_doing_wrong/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "TIL: In ancient China, beans were called \u201cmeat of the fields\u201d (\u7530\u4e2d\u4e4b\u8089), and soy (\u5927\u8c46/\u9ec4\u8c46) was hailed as the \u201cking of the beans\u201d (\u8c46\u4e2d\u4e4b\u738b), reflecting its historical importance and evidence-based nutritional value in modern science.", "selftext": "China is widely recognized as the longest continuous human civilization, with over 5,000 years of recorded history. Soybeans were first domesticated in ancient China and became a staple crop, spreading to other countries through trade and cultural exchanges over centuries. China was a global leader in science and technology for much of history. It was not until the 18th and 19th centuries, during the Industrial Revolution, that Western countries began surpassing China in industrial and technological advancement. This shift was partly due to the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty implementing policies to solidify their authority over the Han Chinese majority, which limited external influence and technological exchange, contributing to China\u2019s relative stagnation.\n\nFor most of China\u2019s history, the vast majority of the population was of the the peasant class, who relied on beans, especially soy, for nutrition, since most did not eat meat more often than a handful of times a year. Meat consumption was limited to wealthier segments of society and special occasions, meaning soybeans and other legumes were essential sources of protein for the broader population. This reliance highlights the nutritional importance of soybeans in sustaining large populations.\n\nLegumes, including soybeans, are fundamental to plant-based diets due to their high protein content and provision of lysine, an essential amino acid often lacking in other plant foods. While all beans provide high quality protein and lysine that nutritionally substitute those of meat, soy, in particular, is unique in multiple ways:\n\n1. Soy is a \u201ccomplete protein,\u201d containing all nine essential amino acids in sufficient amounts.\n2. Soy is also unique in that its Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) rivals that of animal-based proteins such as meat, eggs, and dairy - without all the harmful components in animal foods.\n3. Soy contains more protein than all other beans, per gram.\n4. Soy was, and still is, the only non-grain included in what the Chinese called the \"Five Sacred Grains\" (**\u4e94\u8c37**).\n\nModern nutritional science confirms soybeans\u2019 status as the \u201cKing of the Beans\u201d (**\u8c46\u4e2d\u4e4b\u738b**). Their excellent amino acid profile, high bioavailability, and rich protein content make them unparalleled among plant-based foods.\n\ntldr; Soybeans were highly valued in ancient China for their nutritional and agricultural importance.

{"title": "A Lesson For Me", "selftext": "I learned something valuable that I wanted to share.\n\nMy doctor put me on a WFBPD and I started it on 6/1/2024. She put me on it due to gastrointestinal issues that include IBS and somewhat possible Crohn's. She thought it would calm my small and large intestine.\n\nThe benefits since then have been losing 30 lbs, elimination of arthritis pain, and more energy. Also, my cholesterol plummeted. The gastrointestinal discomfort wasn't completely resolved but it was more mild and digestion had improved.\n\nWe went on a cruise from 12/2 through 12/18. My doctor basically told me to cheat on the cruise and to get back on the diet when I returned. She reasoned that it would be very difficult to follow the diet on the ship.\n\nI have been dairy free for over 2 years because it became obvious that I'm extremely lactose intolerant at minimum and possibly allergic to or intolerant of other components in milk. So, that was a non-negotiable on the cruise.\n\nI did my best to avoid any dairy. I did drink alcohol and eat meat, fish, and eggs. The food and booze were wonderful but...\n\nWithin days of eating everything else but dairy, my gastrointestinal issues gradually returned. I had very loose stool, bad smelly gas, bloating, cramps in my gut, pain in my gut, and mild arthritis pain. I reasoned that some of the things I had eaten like saut\u00e9ed veggies and meat with sauces had stealth dairy. But, I did ask and was assured that my choices were dairy free. So, I'm not convinced that my symptoms were only because of dairy.\n\nI gladly went back to my WFPBD upon return on the afternoon of 12/18. Even in these very few days back on WFPBD, my digestion has improved and I have fewer aches and pains. The bloating went away. I still have some cramping but the cramping never completely resolved after 6 months of following a WFPBD before I went on the cruise. The cramping pre-cruise wasn't entirely constant and was mild.\n\nIn addition, I actually missed \"my food\" on the cruise and craved the things I had been eating on the WFPBD. I found that meat, fish, and eggs are not worth the gastrointestinal distress and arthritis pain they caused. I honestly don't miss eating animal products.\n\nSo, lesson learned. I'm sticking to a WFPBD for life. It's what is best for me. This experiment taught me about what I should be eating for my own optimal health and comfort.\n\nWill I have an occasional Scotch, glass of wine, cognac, etc.? Possibly.

{"title": "Another cholesterol lowering success story", "selftext": "Sharing my story as many others have!\n\nTLDR: Plant based cooking helped my LDL after a journey of kidney transplantation.\n\n# Background\n\nBack in 2016 my checkups and blood draw values started to slowly get worse: blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, etc. My doc at the time gave the usual diet and exercise recommendation despite me already thinking I was already eating healthier and exercising. Anyway, I tried to eat better (in my mind) and exercised even more for 6 months but it turns out I was actually in kidney failure and needed a transplant. A lot of emotions went through my head but ultimately I was hopeful that I could be \"fixed\".\n\n# Uncertainty \n\nI started on dialysis pretty much as soon I received the diagnosis. During that time, I was on a statin but experienced many unpleasant effects from the dialysis itself along with the million other pills I had to take daily. After transplant, I could discontinue the statin since my health values including cholesterol were good. About one year later, much of the blood work values were starting to decline. Turns out my kidney was being rejected by my own body. Bummer. Luckily, the anti-rejection treatment was successful and I was able to keep the transplanted kidney.\n\n# Plant Based?\n\nAfter the anti-rejection treatment finished, my LDL cholesterol remained high (150 mg/dL) even though nearly everything else, including HDL and Triglycerides, were controlled. I was told I would need to go on a statin again but I wanted to try diet and exercise first. Most of my meals were cooked at home and started walking fast every day as that's the most intense exercise my transplanted kidney could handle. Really tried going for it. 3 months later, it barely moved. I was told they needed to see improvement on the next checkup otherwise I would need to go on a statin.\n\nI've always hated cooking with meat. The feeling of raw meat, the sliminess, the smell preparing and the smell of the \"diaper juice\" in the trash can, being careful not to cross contaminate everything, the cleanup, and the knowledge this was a real animal with feelings and thoughts just like us that was forced to be killed. But I hardly knew anything about plant focused food other than the occasional takeout tofu dishes.\n\n# Now We're Cooking\n\nIt started with meatless Mondays. Easy enough, I already enjoy tofu so I'll just make stir fries with it. Then meatless Thursdays. Then well, I need to learn more so I'm not cooking the same damn thing every week. I went a whole week not eating meat and meat products. I learned more about animal cruelty and the health benefits of a plant based diet. No way I could go back to eating meat now. Plant based everyday.\n\nThat kidney and cholesterol checkup was looming ahead. Did I make enough change? I was shocked to see it had **dropped 34 points** to 116 mg/dL in a relatively short amount time. Progress! Still not where I wanted to be but enough to convince the doctors that I didn't need to take a statin immediately. \n\nOther than a peak earlier this year where I was on an extended vacation where I didn't have access to non-processed plant based foods, my LDL has been slowly dropping. Today it reached 95 mg/dL, with my last big change limiting my saturated fats even more. I feel better than ever and my joy of cooking has grown even more.\n\nThank you r/PlantBasedDiet r/veganrecipes and ^(sometimes) r/vegan for the inspiration and support!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgd37961f38e1.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0dec8b4758fdd9321b9c65feec267d26ac494a8\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hixl0r/another_cholesterol_lowering_success_story/", "created_utc": 1734739837.0, "score": 106, "author": "beef-ster", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hixl0r/another_cholesterol_lowering_success_story/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Success story - vegan for 2 years", "selftext": "I would like to share my success story after 2 years of becoming vegan. \nI have been vegetarian from birth . I have been heavy consumer of dairy until 2022.\nJuly 2022 I had severe migraine issues on daily basis. I visited doctor who prescribed medication and suggested to find triggers for migraine. List she suggested was caffeine, lack of sleep, stress and dairy. I was sleeping well. Not heavy consumer of caffeine. So I decided to try reducing dairy intake. Initially just reducing curd, cheese for 2 weeks I started feeling light and migraine reducing, better sleep. Overall I felt less lethargic. I decided to stop dairy completely. Initially I had usual concern about protein intake so I started researching. Came across multiple documentaries on wfpb benefits, how animal protein is harmful. Gave up dairy in 2 months completely except tea and coffee with milk which I had hard time giving up . Slowly reducing number of times in a day I could reduce it to just once a day. By nov 2022 I was able to consume black coffee and black tea. Those documentaries motivated me to go wfpb that is no processed food like avoiding any packet foods, sugar. Within 3 months by Feb 2023 I lost 10 kgs, no health issues. I was eating good quantity of food twice a day without counting calories all this while. Fast forward in 2 years I lost another 4 kgs, healthy loss of weight. In these two years I didn't change anything in physical activity. I used to get frequent cough and cold before 2022 irrespective of weather, once in at least 2 to 3 months. After going wfpb I got cold and cough only thrice in 2 years which was viral infection, recovered in no time. Overall less medication, no major disease. I initially worried about overall nutrients I am getting through food, so I did blood work evry 2 months. To my surprise everything improved, iron improved, haemoglobin improved, cholesterol dropped initially but I noticed whenever I took D3 supplement it spiked. Now I don't prefer D3 supplement and try getting as much sunlight as possible. Now I only take B12 supplement. \n\nWhat kept me motivated? Improved energy levels is first. I kept watching videos frequently like vegan linked YouTube channel which keeps publishing interview of success story. Game changers documentary, forks vs knives documentary and whatever comes in my feed. \nOnce I decided to go vegan, I announced to friends and family. It is not easy saying no to good especially in social gatherings. Don't keep exceptions, cheat day concept didn't work for me as it leaves memory of taste and you crave to have it again. \n\nIf you are thinking to go vegan go for it, figure out what works for you by slowly changing diet. Don't do drastic change at once. After some time it is like if I have processed food I don't have proper sleep and feels heavy next day.

{"title": "Plant Based Success", "selftext": "Hey there!  I'm new here and, after browsing around, I felt inspired to share my success with whole food plant based eating.\n\nBack in July, I had some sort of event, but I'm not exactly sure what it was as I got my heart tested and everything.  The main thing I got out of it was it scared me straight.  I had been going downhill from emotional binge eating and, when I got tested, my LDLs were 215 at the time (up from 170 just 6 months prior).  This means I had to go on medication to lower it, which I hated the thought of it.\n\nAt that point, I dropped all meat, dairy, processed food, sugar, and even wheat (for the most part as it tended to stimulate sugar cravings).  I upped my fruit and vegetables a lot, had rice, beans, nuts, and all of that stuff.\n\nWith all the cardiology tests, they had me do a stress test, which suggested I might have coronary artery disease so they needed to do a scan to find out for sure.  I kept going on the diet and it wasn't for another month or two until I had the scan done.  At that point, it had been close to 3 months since the event and thankfully, the scan was clear.\n\nThis past week, I had visited the cardiologist after my last blood test to reveal my LDLs went down to 62!  I had figured it would have gone down like 30 points or something, but not that much.  This was enough to take me off the cholesterol meds (I pushed for it) and hopefully it'll remain low in my next test in January.  I was so happy to get off those meds and reclaim my health.  Not to mention I've lost over 30 pounds in that time period.  I feel so much better and I want to keep this going as I continue to become healthier.\n\nI'm looking forward to increasingly feeling better as I get healthier.

{"title": "Questions about dietary fat.", "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI browse through this sub a lot and I understand most people here follow a lower fat diet and are generally against cooking oils. I just had a few questions about dietary fat, saturated fat in particular. I was not able to find much evidence or studies on them so thought people on this sub might have any theories or evidence for those questions. Some of them are more related to members of this sub while others are about broader topics.\n\n1. How low do you keep your dietary fat? On your macros, what percentage does fat make up? 20 - 30% or lower?\n2. Why no oil? As far as I am aware, most cultures have traditionally used some form of oil for millenia. Example: olive oil on the Mediterranean region, peanut/soybean/sesame oil in China, sesame/mustard/coconut oil in India, etc. Was the oil used in lower amounts compared to how much we have today? \n\nNow the broader questions:\n1. Why are higher fat diets unhealthy? I see that higher fat diets usually have higher rates of heart disease. Is there any mechanism that causes this? Or is it simple CICO? Like is there a biochemical mechanism that puts people on higher fat diets more at risk for heart disease or is it something like higher fat means higher calories so people but on more fat tissue resulting in heart disease?\n2. Why is saturated fat bad for us? There is so much evidence to suggest that higher saturated fat is a risk factor for variouses diseases. What causes saturated food to be unhealthy for us? \n\nI am mostly following the principles of starch solution. Basing my diet on starchy foods and supplementing with fruits and vegetables. I still have about 1 tbsp of oil for cooking and an ounce of nuts for healthy fats. My macros are something like 65% carb 20% protein and 15% fat.

{"title": "REPOSTED: Purple Sweet Potato Roti, Tofu and Pumpkin Curry & Date, Nut and Beetroot Balls for Plant-Based Diwali", "selftext": "Mods previously deleted this post because I didn\u2019t provide the recipe on time. Sorry guys, I didn\u2019t realize the recipe was mandatory! So here it is:\n\nPURPLE SWEET POTATO ROTI:\n\nIngredients:\n1 purple sweet potato\n1 1/2 cup of flour (preferably whole wheat)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Peel the skin of the sweet potato and cut it into chunks. Set the chunks to boil until mashable. \n2. Strain the boiled sweet potato chunks. Pour them into a mixing bowl and mash. \n3. Add 1 cup of flour into the potato mash and initially mix it with a spoon. Be careful because it will be hot. After it\u2019s a bit mixed, you can combine it with your hands. Knead the mix into a dough.\n4. Set the dough aside in the mixing bowl covered for around 10 min. In the meantime, set aside a cup of flour and cover your rolling surface with flour.\n5. After ten minutes, pull off about a ping pong size chunk from the dough and roll it into a ball in your hands. Gently press the ball with your palms so it forms into a mochi shape. Then coat both sides of the mochi shaped dough with flour.\n6. Place the mochi shaped dough piece on the floured surface and roll with a rolling pin into a very thin circle (which is your uncooked roti). \n7. Being a pan to low-medium heat. Once the pan is warm, add the uncooked roti to the pan. Leave it for about 30 seconds before flipping it.  If you see bubbles forming, it means the roti is cooking. Be careful that it doesn\u2019t burn.\n8. Once it\u2019s cooked on both sides, set it aside. Repeat steps 5 to 8 for the remainder of the dough and that will complete your rotis.\n\n\nPUMPKIN TOFU CURRY:\n\nIngredients:\n1/2 can of pumpkin pur\u00e9e\n1/2 block of extra firm or superfirm tofu \n1/2 white or red onion\n2-3 cloves garlic\n1-2 inch piece of ginger root\n1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e \n1-2 tbsp of hemp seeds\n2-3 tbsp of fenugreek (essential for authenticity)\n\nSpices:\n1-2 tsp of coriander powder\n1/2 tsp black pepper\n1/4-1/2 tsp red chili powder (depending on heat tolerance)\n1/4 tsp cumin powder\n1/4 tsp turmeric\nSalt to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Water saut\u00e9 chopped onion, garlic and ginger on low-medium heat. Ensure it doesn\u2019t burn.\n2. Add the spices and combine very briefly before pouring in the pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Again, make sure the spices don\u2019t burn (I highly recommend portioning out the spice mix ahead of time).\n3. Stir in 1/3 cup of water and combine to cook. Add in tomato pur\u00e9e and hemp seeds.\n4. After it\u2019s cooked for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly to ensure that it doesn\u2019t burn, blend with an immersion blender (I used the nutribullet variety). If you don\u2019t have one, you can wait for the mixture to cool and add it to a conventional blender, but then this will take a bit longer.\n5. Once you\u2019ve blended the mixture into a smooth gravy, add tofu cut into blocks and dried fenugreek leaves. Cook for another 3-5 minutes, stirring constantly and ensuring that the bottom isn\u2019t burning. \n6. After it\u2019s cooked for those 3-5 minutes, it\u2019s ready!\n\nDATE & NUT & BEETROOT BALLS\n\nIngredients:\n2 dates\n1/3 cup oats\n1/4 cup walnuts\n2 tsp beetroot powder\n\nInstructions:\n1. Blend the oats and the beetroot powder into a flour using a blender. \n2. Keeping the oats in the blender, add in pitted dates and walnuts. Continue blending. This should create a sticky, combined \u201cdough\u201d\n3. Collect the contents of the blender into a mixing bowl. Pull small pieces off and roll into balls.\n4. Set the balls into a bowl for serving. Sprinkle additional beetroot powder on the balls for color.

{"title": "Diabetes: How long to lower fasting glucose?", "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nThis is cross-posted from r/wfpb.  Looking for any guidance and appreciate any input - posting this on behalf of my partner.\n\nMy partner has been fat their entire life and hates going to the doctor. They opted to pay for a blood test with a lab just to check in how they're doing and it looks like they're officially diabetic with a fasting glucose of 358 and an A1c over 13.\n\nThey're adamant about correcting this with lifestyle and committing to a Fuhrman / McDougall / Engine 2 way of eating to get this under control as well as adding muscle to help regulate levels. Medications are an absolute last resort. \n\nSo I want to ask, how long did it take to drop your fasting glucose? What should they be doing right now? Especially if they don't want to go to the doctor and come out with a bunch of prescriptions? What is the absolute line where they need to see a doctor?\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: Thank you, everyone, for your pushes and advice. It really made a difference. A few people said this wasn't being taken seriously or my partner doesn't care about their health and I'd just like to say that's shameful to assume. My partner was scarred, didn't want to be shamed, didn't want to be admitted, and didn't want to learn there was massive damage they didn't know about. Additionally, they didn't want a massive lecture about being another big fat person who is just another uncontrolled diabetic or dealing with disgust from staff. They've had very bad doctor experiences in the past and try to handle shit themselves as a result. \n\nWe tried going to urgent care yesterday since they don't have any symptoms. Urgent care said nope and sent us to the ER. The ER was quick but very confrontational to start about why we were there - when we explained my partner has never had insulin before or a blood test with results like this, it went a bit better. \n\nThey checked their glucose levels and after they had eaten about 4 hours prior their glucose was 237. A bag of IV and 10 units of insulin later, we were discharged with no directions on how to check blood glucose or what to do. Thankfully we have a type 1 diabetic niece so we knew vaguely what to expect and a very helpful pharmacist filled in the gaps. When we got home 3 hours late, we checked their glucose again and it had gone down 10 so it looks like massive insulin resistance. \n\nI'm reading Mastering Diabetes again and they're switching to a McDougall maximum weight loss way of eating. Today we go grocery shopping to buy enough greens and I'm preparing hummus and beans to keep them full. We feel good and are scheduling a primary physician today to follow up. \n\nUPDATE 2: Glucose this morning was 160. Partner exercises for about 30 minutes last night with weights and ate a 50/50 starchy vegetable and greens meal for dinner. No additional insulin.

Seeking opinions on best vegan supplements to replace current.\n\nPlant-based as of January (primarily plant-based omnivore for most of 2024). Took vegan blood test at Quest early April; most things were normal but a few were out of range or decreased a lot, so I'd like to focus on stabilizing these:\n\nIRON: 73 (down from 117 in Jan) ug/dL.\nFERRITIN: 33 ng/mL (slightly below range).\n[Notes:]\nI eat lots of lentils and seeds (75-100% RDA before other sources). I'll add frozen kale. I was eating Brad's Salad Snack kale daily but apparently that's only 10% a bag lol.\n\nB6: 34.5 (range max 21.7) ng/mL.\n[Notes:]\nNo idea why B6 is above range. I took multi with high B6 dose for little while in Jan (Life Extension 2-per-day), thought that would've cleared.\n\nB12: 431 (down from 614 in Jan) pg/mL.\n[Notes:]\nNot sure why it dropped so much. Current multivitamin is 50 mcg (2083%), in 2 tabs; I take one before each of 2 meals. Should I crush them? I didn't stop supplements before testing, so presumably B12 would've been even lower than this.\n\nOmegas (started omega pills since last test):\nEPA+DPA+DHA: 4.5% by wt (below range, decreased slightly).\nARACHIDONIC ACID / EPA RATIO: 8.0.\nOMEGA 6/3 RATIO: 8.6.\nOMEGA 3 TOTAL: 4.5%.\nEPA: 0.9%.\nDPA: 1.2%.\nDHA: 2.4%.\nOMEGA 6 TOTAL: 39.1%.\nARACHIDONIC ACID: 7.3 (below range, decreased slightly).\nLINOLEIC ACID: 29.8 (above range).\n\nOther (normal):\nIodine: 72 mcg/L.\nZinc: 70 mcg/dL.\nB1: 163 nmol/L.\nCalcium: 9.7 mg/dL.\nD: 45 ng/mL.\n\nMisc notes: Stable weight and BMI ~20. I feel energetic and healthy.\n\nCurrent supplements and nutrient powders: Jarrow Formulas Men's Multi+, Sports Research Algae Omega 3, each taken twice a day as suggested, but at different meals (I theorize more is absorbed this way overall), just before the meal. I also eat half a scoop of Vega All-In-One nutrient powder in my breakfast cereal; doesn't seem to add much.\n\nGeneral plan: potentially replace current supplements (above) with vegan multivitamin containing, at minimum, B12 (much higher amount), iron, and omega, and no B6. Add frozen kale for additional iron.\n\nFor the replacement supplement, I'm currently deciding among the below 3. (Please feel free to share any other suggestions. My preference is consolidation: everything in one supplement, vs separate pills for vitamins and omegas, for example.)\n\nWHOLIER: https://a.co/d/dVgsRYi\nPROS: Higher iron than other 2; confirmed carrageenan-free; available in Whole Foods.\nCONS: Lower omega than other 2; MCT oil (triglyceride); more expensive.\n\nNEVISS: https://a.co/d/dptqDDa\nPROS: Cheapest, especially after discount; chewable so maybe better absorbed.\nCONS: Unfamiliar brand - trustworthy?\n\nFUTURE KIND: https://a.co/d/79TdtGS\nPROS: Highest omega 3; confirmed carrageenan-free.\nCONS: Missing iron and a few others; I doubt I need 400 mcg B12 daily.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1k8dyzv/plantbased_blood_test_at_4_mos_what_to_change/", "created_utc": 1745677010.0, "score": 5, "author": "aryanmsh", "num_comments": 43, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1k8dyzv/plantbased_blood_test_at_4_mos_what_to_change/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

When my partner became lucid I asked her whether the hospital had been providing the essential nutrient supplements she needed. She said no. I grabbed the attending physician & asked why if they knew she ate only WFPB, they had been failing to supplement B-12, D3, Omega 3/6/9, iodine & magnesium. He looked at me blankly when I said that proper nutrition was vital, if not more so, than the meds they were pumping in her. I asked the medical staff whether I could start bringing in what she needed. The answer, unsurprisingly, was \u201cnope\u201d - they had to control all intakes. \nSoon after that, a nurse came in with the supplements I had been requesting. I asked her what she was giving & they didn\u2019t seem to grasp that \u201cfish oil\u201d was not an acceptable supplement.

Worst of all, one cannot count on a hospital to deconflict meds & nutritional supplements b/c they fail to grasp the potential that meds & supplements can clash.

{"title": "Hungry for Lunch!", "selftext": "Howdy folks!\nI'm an ethical vegan, but I'm trying to move towards a wfpb diet and away from overly processed foods. I'm in a place where I'd like to invest in my health AND my ethics. Here's my problem - I'm hungry!! I usually start th day with a highish protein breakfast (smoothie with protein powder, tofu scramble, greek plant yogurt and granola). I have a tendency to forget to eat or eat a really light lunch. This is in part due to poor hunger queues but also because I don't know what to eat!\n\nThis is ESPECIALLY and issue on days where I workout. I rock climb. I often find myself ravenous in the late afternoon on days I climb, even when I follow the workout with protein (20 grams minimum). I also cycle to work and work a pretty active job. This activity level has a tendency to create insatiable hunger which causes me to turn to high calorie density processed foods (which is okay *sometimes* but not on a daily basis!)\n\nThis is where y'all come in. I am interested in acquiring some filling wfpb lunch and dinner ideas. Searching online has often resulted in underflavored, low protein, low calorie (like 300 for a meal yikes!!) meals.  I'm also curious what y'all eat for snacks. Snacks are the one thing I either over or undereat for every time. It'll either be something like a bunch of tortilla chips and salsa or ten baby carrots. I need ideas better than \"handful of pistacios.\" My hope too is that if I eat more filling meals I won't need to snack as much.. \n\nI have very few dislikes. I love beans, tofu, tempeh (my favorite I think), lentils, seitan, etc. I also love basically all produce except raw arugula. I have no known allergies but live with someone who is extremely allergic to hemp so I do not buy it. I understand that this is a commonly asked question but my searching has not yet yielded adequate results so I thought I'd ask!\n\nEDITED to add the bit about working out!

Both knees, hip, shoulder and elbow.  Aches and pains everywhere.  Failed DMARDS (zero effect) and given my inflammation markers were stupid crazy, was placed on biologicals.  Humira failed and then Simponi finally worked.  Swelling reduced, baker\u2019s cysts gone and pain manageable.  Happy Chappy:).\nBut in my blood work I couldn\u2019t ever get CRP and others down to safe levels.  This caught up with me eventually and I started getting chest pains, failed a stress test and CT + echo picked up major blockages.  After a lot of research I decided on the low oil, whole food plant based approach by Caldwell Esselstyn (Fork over knives dude) which has great success in Cardiovascular patients.\nI had a 6 week gap before undergoing an angioplasty for 2 or 3 stents.  So I gave the diet a go 100%.\nStarted to really feel well after about 4 weeks.  Could walk without any shoulder or arm pain.  Then I went in for my full blood work for the Cardiologist (and Rheumatologist) and got a massive shock.  I was so focused on the heart that I didn\u2019t realise my PA had basically become nonexistent.  All markers went to almost zero.  Rheumatologist was like \u201cwow, who\u2019s diet\u201d?.  Finally my PA was in a good spot (touch wood it holds) for the first time.\nBigger shock came next.  Blood pressure was normally 140-150/85.  Now 110/75. No meds.\nCholesterol down by 60% (tried statin but had side effects.  But it may have contributed due to long half life).  Plus other benefits I would prefer not to post.  \nAnyhow I do the angiogram and was told all good.  No stents required and no foreseeable need. WTF?\nAnyway I am in a happy place right now.  I see a lot of other autoimmune sufferers having the same success with this diet in conjunction with their meds.  \nI really hope this lasts\n\nEdit from me.  Sorry about the long paragraph.  I thumb typed from my phone.  I had tried the diet years ago and started getting good results.  But I\u2019m a beer and steak man.  Just couldn\u2019t cut it.

And was able to fairly easily drop to a 26 BMI with portion control of the my Whole Foods diet. The weight loss helped to control my hypertension. I so to say 'let myself go' due to a move, and my BMI crept up to almost 27 (and I was enjoying a normal life things - eating out, weekly a couple alcohol drinks, etc...) but still generally eating very healthy (compared to standard American diet) and still strength training & moderate exercise 3 times a week. My hypertension kicked back in, and I felt like crap. I upped my exercise routine and started cleaning up those loose ends in my diet (and am taking a small does of lisinopril now). In a month of Whole Foods, added exercise, and portion control, I very easily once again dropped my BMI to 25.8 now (a full point down) and even though I'm still on the low dose hypertension medicine, my BP has been 110/60 for a couple weeks solidly now\n\nI wanted to move towards Whole Foods, Plant Based for the additional health benefits that my Whole Foods diet lacks. \n\nBut I HATE beans.

I just can't find beans appealing! And on top of it, the recipes I've been trying for WFPB have been higher in sodium. I tend to do best trying a meal plan so I can just follow something without thought at first - to get me inspired - so tried a Broccoli Mum meal plan. The meals have been VERY filling, extremely so. And other than the beans, tasty. But higher sodium and I'm seeing my BP rising again, even with removing some of the sodium from the recipes (low sodium soy sauce, flat out not adding the salt to so recipes, etc ..) but it's still too much, and my BP seems to rising the last couple days since really diving into this WFPB (125/75).

{"title": "How to stop the spiral?", "selftext": "So I went WFPB last October and it was like a switch went off in my brain. For some reason, it was super easy to do.

Had a bit of fatigue after about three weeks, but stuck with it and it went away. Exercise also became easy and I actually craved it.

I've had no motivation to exercise and this weekend I've had a real 'eff it' attitude to diet. I even had a shanklish pizza from a local Lebanese bakery (one of my fave treats prior to wfpb) and some takeaway fried rice with egg because I was craving comfort food at the end of an exhausting week.

I'm super hungry, and craving the 'bad' comfort foods I've had no interest in for months. \n\nHas anyone been in this position? Did you come up with any strategies to shake yourself out of it?

{"title": "From Keto to Low Fat Vegan", "selftext": "Hi. I'm writing to you because you might be interested in my nutritional \"experiment\". For the past 4 months I've been on a very strict keto diet (I ate less than 20g of carbs), I measured my ketones with a blood meter (sometimes they were even above 3, so high), so I was almost constantly in ketosis.\n\nInitially I also added intermittent fasting to the keto diet, 16-18 hours without food. I wasn't terribly obese but I was slightly overweight. I started losing weight quickly (understandably, I cut out almost all carbs) and initially felt pretty good - lots of energy.\n\nOnce I lost most of my belly fat I started losing energy, feeling increasingly tired, and keeping my ketone levels high without eating absurd amounts of fat was difficult.\n\nI like reading about diets, medicine, etc. and I was never a keto fanatic. I knew well that consuming that much saturated fat was very risky.\n\nI used the keto diet mainly because of its possible positive effect on depression (I have been suffering from depression for many years).\n\nIn the last month on a diet I felt worse and worse. My mood was getting worse, I felt weaker and weaker, and when I got home from work I had to take a nap because my eyes would close by themselves. \n\nIn addition, I began to notice more and more disturbing symptoms from the digestive system. My bowel movements (which were never great) became less frequent. After eating fat, my stomach was bothering me more and more. In recent days, I felt nausea and a loud sloshing in my stomach and intestines that tipped the scales and I decided to give up the diet.\n\nHowever, while on the keto diet, I have learned a few healthy habits that I would like to stick to. For example, I have completely given up sugar and simple carbohydrates.\n\nSince I consider eating meat and dairy unhealthy, I decided to switch to a vegan diet, but... and here's a surprise: very low-fat. (from one extreme to another, that's how I am).\n\nI will not eat fatty plant foods (like seeds, nuts, avocados and olives - I'm sick of them on keto...), I will not add fat to my meals. I think that plant foods have some fat in them anyway, which should be enough for the body to function. My diet will be a bit like the Ornish diet, except for the egg whites and low-fat dairy.\n\nI am very curious how the body will react and function after returning to carbohydrates and depriving it of excess fat. If you are also interested, I will write about mine in a while.\n\nI'm on day 4 of this diet and so far returning to carbohydrates has been a good decision. My mood has improved (the keto diet deprives the body of serotonin and dopamine), I sleep much better (on keto I slept even 10-12 hours and I wasn't fully regenerated and interestingly I didn't have dreams - now they're back), as if my brain has returned to normal.

{"title": "Self-made nutmilk in coffee tastes awful, what can I do?", "selftext": "I recently got into making my own nutmilk because I want to use less store-bought Oatly Barista. I use a regular espresso maker for the stove and like to use much milk to mellow out the bitterness and acidity from the espresso.\n\nI did everything that was recommended to avoid it curdling from the acidity of my coffee (heating up the milk and also using sodium bicarbonate to make the coffee less acidic) and it technically worked well.\n\nSo far, I tried pure cashew milk with sunflower oil, cashew milk with coconut cream, and almond milk with just a little bit of coconut cream for the taste.\n\nI used soy lecithin to emulsify the fat content (sunflower oil, fat from coconut cream).\n\nBut unfortunately, I didn\u2019t like the taste at all. I usually only drink Oatly Barista since it\u2019s creamy and doesn\u2019t leave a weird aftertaste like the majority of the brands I\u2019ve tried over the years. I like how Oatly somehow completes the flavour of my coffee in a way that no other plant milk has done so far - it doesn\u2019t overpower the coffee taste, but rather mellows out the bitterness and acidity without taking too much of the aroma away.\n\nBut my nutmilk\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I like the taste of it on its own; if I drink it pure or eat cereal with it it\u2019s delicious. But the almond milk got somehow really gross when I heated it up, it had like a slimy texture and it split (even though I added soy lecithin) and my coffee tasted watery and bitter at the same time with all the recipes I've tried.\n\nI missed the creaminess and richness even though my nutmilk contained fat, and so I am wondering what exactly in plant milk does that for coffee? Do I need a kind of protein content? Do I have to add something else? I'd really like to try hazelnut milk next.\n\nBtw, I also tried Guar Gum once as a stabiliser, but I didn\u2019t like the consistency at all, it tasted more slimy than creamy. If you have ever tried the Coconut Barista Milk from Alpro, you might know what I mean - the taste is great, but the consistency feels off, like it was artificially stabilised (though they used Gellan, not Guar Gum).\n\nSomebody told me soy lecithin may prevent the milk from foaming, but tbh, that\u2019s not so important to me. The taste and consistency is what matters - I want my latte to taste great, not look great. ;)\n\nI already made a post in the vegan subreddit and there are a lot of nutmilk specialists there, but I didn\u2019t get the info I need - they seem content with their coffee, but I am picky and want it to taste right to me. The coffee subreddit didn\u2019t allow my post since it wasn\u2019t deemed substantial.\n\nI know this is a very particular question, but I am deep in the nutmilk rabbit hole now and I want to crack the code of creamy plant-based milk that works with coffee and that I can make at home.\n\nIf anyone has some advice for me, I'd be very grateful!\n\nUPDATE: \n\nFor anyone who\u2019s interested, I made hazelnut milk today and it\u2019s really good in coffee! I used ~150g if roasted peeled hazelnuts (soaked over night) for about 800ml of Water, a tbsp of cashew butter, a pinch of salt, a tiny amount of rice syrup, a tsp vanilla, 3 tbsp of sunflower oil and one tsp of soy lecithin. \n\nI heated it up and it doesn\u2019t get slimy like my almond milk and it goes very well as a Latte made with much milk and an espresso. So finally, a success :) It\u2019s less creamy than the cashew coconut milk but that doesn\u2019t bother me since the taste is so great and it complements the coffee aroma without needing to be super rich. The flavour of the roasted hazelnuts is absolutely amazing. \n\nI used a high speed blender and a nut milk bag. \n\nI'll try macadamia next!

{"title": "Chicken slip up please help", "selftext": "Context: I was raised vegetarian and other than a few weeks of a pescatarian phase when I was about 10 I\u2019ve never eaten meat in my life. Ever. No slip ups with anything not even untraceable things like broth or gelatine. I always check im always \u2018crazy\u2019 and \u2018extra\u2019 about it but I have NEVER had a slip up (that I\u2019m aware of obviously) but seriously never. Other vegetarians seem very casual to me about it they are okay with gelatine, collagen or will indulge in a small amount of meat for a special occasion. While I would never judge someone for this, I have always considered myself on the very very extreme side of being vegetarian compared to others in the community. I live with my dad who eats meat and prepares some of my meals and he is especially careful to not have any cross- contamination or anything and the same with my boyfriend who is also an avid meat-eater. About a year ago my mum (who raised me as vegetarian but like I mentioned is a little less serious- eats gelatine ect) offered me a chocolate that was branded as healthy and claimed to have collagen in it on the package, I handed it back to her and said it has collagen, she then read the packaging out loud and told me it was \u2018coconut collagen\u2019. I was a little less educated on supplements then but I knew that there were ways to have ingredients that promoted collagen that weren\u2019t necessarily actual collagen, and she just told me it was completely vegan so I ate it. Few days later she was having another one and I read the packaging which turned out to have read coconut, collagen. I didn\u2019t get mad at her or blame her I simply informed her and she apologised and said she read it wrong. Skip to now, she brought home two burritos, one was already half eaten that was supposed to be for her and one unwrapped one for me but she claimed that she thought the one she was eating has egg and fake meat which she doesn\u2019t like so she told me to eat hers and proceeded to watch me eat most of it before eating hers. Towards being finish I pulled out what I thought looked like chicken and asked her if it was, she told me it was fake meat again but I insisted it looked like chicken and looked at their website and the burrito she got \u2018for herself\u2019 which she gave me had chicken but the one she was actually eating was completely vegan. After that I just told her I needed space from her to think but I wasn\u2019t mad, she\u2019s insisted that there is no reason to be mad and im not acting mad toward her but im fucking fuming. Even if she didn\u2019t make the first mistake she was more careless about it than all the meat eaters in my life. And I genuinely think im going into a depression after eating it, ik it might sound dramatic to some people but not eating meat is a pillar of who I am and this has completely crushed me I feel like I don\u2019t want to live.

Bulk recipes that are fun for kids and relatively simple to put together?\n\nI just got a job running the weekly hot lunch program in my small, rural community (K-7 school). For now I'm just taking over the menu from the guy who had to leave for family reasons. It's full of typical cafeteria junky food, although mixed with some wholesome foods too.\n\nIt's a progressive enough community that I think the parents will be supportive. In the summer, students work with the community garden to teach the kids about where food comes from.\n\nI've been given free reign for next year and I'd love to revamp the whole menu to be whole food plant based.\n\nProblem is, at home I'm all about one pot stews and soups, salads, and grazing on simple snacks. I have no idea where to start!!!\n\nI want the school menu to be so fun and tasty for the kids that they won't even notice it's not chicken fingers and pizza. Maybe, dare I hope, to even like it so much they go home and get their parents excited to try some new meals? (Maybe have recipes available?)\n\nWe have great volunteers but this will be new for them. And I'm not experienced enough at large scale cooking to easily scale up recipes.\n\nSo I need help!\n\nEDIT: I may not have been clear that it's only one lunch a week at a school in Canada, where the whole \"cafeteria thing\" isn't like in the US or UK. No breakfast, no dessert, no drinks; one hot entree, a piece of fruit, and sometimes a side like biscuits or salad.\n\nThe hot lunch program is run by a local non-profit community health organization (which is my employer, not the school board) and funded directly by the parents who opt-in to the program in September after reviewing the menu. Parents can opt out if the menu doesn't suit their kids' palate, and send them with lunch that day.\n\nMy understanding is the program used to be entirely whole foods, mostly seasonal and sourced from local farms. I'm not clear how or why that changed but I'll look into it. My point being there's precedent for the \"healthy\" aspect. Plant based might be a tougher sell, but then it's only one meal a week and no one's forced into it.\n\nWhen I say progressive rural community, I mean the island is mostly West Coast hippies and organic farmers. I imagine there are more parents currently opting out because it's junky, than would because it's too healthy.\n\nAll that being said, I really appreciate the feedback to get the administration on board. There's a strong PAC (parent advisory committee) and the principal is really down to earth. So I think it's totally doable to get them on board and in support.\n\nI'm also willing to do a junky menu once a month, to emphasize these foods are to be eaten exceptionally for fun, not regularly for sustenance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i3bg73/im_the_new_lunch_lady_help_us_go_wfpb/", "created_utc": 1737100452.0, "score": 84, "author": "Schrodingers_Ape", "num_comments": 39, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i3bg73/im_the_new_lunch_lady_help_us_go_wfpb/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "meal delivery services roundup & quick healthiness evals from WFPB perspective", "selftext": "There have been several threads on meal delivery services for plant-based meals here and on other WFPB subs but they all seem to miss many options. Here's a roundup of every one I could find offering ready-to-eat meals, with a quick good vs bad evaluation of the healthiness of the current menu of each one in terms of conforming to WFPB guidelines (as exemplified by Greger, Ornish, & similar proponents).\n\nThis was a big process in which I analyzed the ingredients list & entered the nutrition info for a half dozen or more menu items of each into a spreadsheet to calculate things like fat % and fiber ratio to calories. The most common problems are too much fat, use of oil, added sweeteners, and/or refined grains.\n\n* Whole Harvest: Website shows it as operating again after a recent 2024 pause. Good: Everything no-oil. Most stuff no added sugars. Several SOS-free options (& menu filterable by this). Min 8 items per shipment but can choose all 8 individually (from 16 entree options + 2 breakfast + 2 snacks/desert this week). Bad: Some items have added sugars. Some use refined grains, eg couscous & pearl barley. Ingredients not listed in decreasing order of amount (confirmed with their customer service), so can't tell how much eg refined grains there are if any listed anywhere in ingredients. Some items have more fat and/or protein than recommended by folks like Ornish, Greger, Longo, etc. (This is hard to avoid though, and this service seems to be lower than most.)\n* Vegin Out: Can order the weekly vegan menu but not pick individual dishes. This week's has 3 entrees + 4 sides. Good: Mostly oil free, low sugar, low sodium. Bad: Added sugars not broken out separately in nutrition info. Includes maple syrup, refined grains (eg, not-whole-grain noodles) & white potatoes. Costs more for shipping outside of California. All-or-nothing ordering.\n* First Seed:\u00a0Indian. Good: Entirely plant-based. No oil. No added sugars. Low fat. High fiber. Bad: It's really only 6 dishes, 4 of which are mainly legumes (beans or lentils), 1 of which has white (basmati) rice as 1st ingredient. So only 1 has veggies & lacks refined grains, and this one is sold out for the next half-year. The legume dishes are high in protein if judged by themselves but they could be used as sauces with legumes in them by combining them with veggies & whole grains. Indian may not be enough variety of ethnicity for some. Looks like it ships less often than weekly.\n* Sprinly: 6 items listed for this week. Good: No refined sugars (narrowly defined, see below). Claims to keep oil to a minimum & has some clearly marked oil-free items. Can see future week's menu items. Bad: Still uses oil. Though no refined sugars, does use near equivalents like maple syrup. Some use of refined grains. Overall fat % higher than common recs and higher than Whole Harvest (several items 20-36% fat), probably mostly due to the oil.\n* LeafSide: Freeze-dried meals---just add (hot) water. Just considered the savory bowls. Good: No oil, no added sugars, no refined grains (though white potatoes were used in a few dishes). SOS-free available by request. Bad: Too much fat in most dishes. Freeze-dried food causes bloating for some people.\n* Planted Table\u00a0(SF Bay area): Good: Vegan, natural ingredients. Bad: Incomplete nutrition info (eg fiber not listed, added sugars not listed). Incomplete ingredients lists (eg \"creamy salsa dressing\" not expanded). Too much fat. (Only checked first 6 menu items, and all had too much except lettuce wraps.) Refined grains & sweeteners (white bread, white rice, molasses).\u00a0\n* Purple Carrot: Good: Many options. Bad: Lots of oil. High in fat. Low fiber. Lots of use of refined grains (white bread, white rice, refined pasta).\n* Daily Harvest: Looked at the \"heart healthy\" bowls, appropriate for lunch or dinner.\u00a0Good: Many options. No added sugars. Bad: Lots of oil. Lots of fat. Not enough fiber.\n* Thistle: Good: Has plant-based versions of everything. Bad: Not enough fiber. Too much oil. Too much fat.\n* Fire Road: Plant-based in the sense of not using meat sourced from animals but most meals still meat-centric recipes using lab-grown meat (eg Beyond) or plant-based meat-substitutes like soy-curls. Seems to lean in a keto / fitness direction philosophically rather than a WFPB direction. Many menu items high fat, and high protein seems to be a goal.\n* Methodology: Not entirely plant-based and the vegan lunch/dinner options mostly seem like meat dishes with tempeh or tofu substituted for the meat. Good: They have several vegan options. Bad: Added sugars not specified. Lots of oil. The 1 menu item I looked at had high fat and protein.\n* Sakara: Nutrition info not provided for menu items, so can't evaluate. Many aspects sound good: plant-rich, lots of greens, nutritient density, etc. Free of meat, dairy, refined sugars, etc.\n* HungryRoot: Can't see menu at all. Tried long quiz but then wanted me to sign up before showing me anything else.\n* MamaSezz: No longer seems to provide read-to-eat fresh meals. Only prepackaged snacks now.\n\nI didn't include links to the services but each is easy to find via websearch.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i0isfw/meal_delivery_services_roundup_quick_healthiness/", "created_utc": 1736788017.0, "score": 9, "author": "kpfleger", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1i0isfw/meal_delivery_services_roundup_quick_healthiness/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

For someone exercising several times a week, I've been reading that my protein intake should be around 1.6-2g/kg of body weight (for me that would be 1.6 \\* 75 = 120g at minimum). I've been eating fairly well: a protein powder smoothie for breakfast with peanut butter, chia seeds, blueberries, oats; lunch I'd have a buddha bowl with quinoa, sweet potato, edamame beans, chickpeas, etc; and for dinner, I'd usually just have a pasta or something and if I have space another protein shake. I'm not too keen on counting calories too strictly (coz life is meant for living), but I reckon I should be getting kind of close.\n\nBut what I'd quite like to get into is snacking throughout the day on jerky, or as it's called in South Africa where I'm from, biltong. And it seems seitan is a good meat substitute for it. I've found some good recipes online and I think I'll invest in a dehydrator. But I'm still not able to figure out a few things:\n\n* If I use vital wheat gluten instead of the washing-starch-off-of-regular-flour method, is the protein count per gram massively different? Asking because of how expensive the vital variety is.\n* Does dehydrating the seitan in order to make the biltong change the protein content at all?\n* How long can the biltong last on a shelf if it's completely dehydrated? I'd like to make bulk so as to avoid doing it over and over again every couple of days.\n* Apparently it's not a 'complete protein' and should be eaten alongside legumes. Is this a must-do?

If not available, feel free to use other legumes or even just chickpeas.\n\nIngredients for the stew:\n\n- 200 g chickpeas (dry)\n- 200 g cicerchias (dry)\n- 400 g zucchini\n- 400 g soy sour cream\n- 4-5 cloves of garlic (or 1 tbsp garlic powder)\n- 1 medium onion (or 1 tbsp onion powder)\n- 3-4 medium carrots\n- 1-2 medium banana peppers\n- 1 large tomato\n- 3-4 bay leaves\n- 2 tbsp. paprika\n- half tsp. grounded black pepper\n- 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar\n- chives to taste\n- parsley to taste\n- basil to taste\n- salt to taste\n\nThe first step is to make the soy sour cream sauce the day before cooking, then leave it in the fridge overnight to allow the flavours to blend. This means mixing the red pepper, herbs, pepper and a little salt into the soy sour cream. You can also add other ground spices to the mix, such as cumin or garlic powder, onion powder or tomato powder. Cover the sauce airtight and refrigerate it. Take the sauce out of the fridge long enough before cooking so that it is not too cold when you gradually mix it with the other ingredients.\n\nSaut\u00e9 the chopped onion and garlic in a pressure cooker on low heat with a little water. When the chickpeas and cicerchias have been saut\u00e9ed, add them to the pot. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the ingredients by a cm and a half. Add the bay leaves, cover the pressure cooker and cook on high setting over maximum heat until it sizzles. When the whistle blows, turn the heat down to low and cook the contents of the pressure cooker for 40 minutes - if you are using non-lacto-fermented soaked legumes, 15-20 minutes is sufficient, but the exact time will depend on the pressure cooker. After 40 minutes, turn off the heat and wait for the pressure cooker to release all the steam.\n\nMeanwhile, in a pot, start steaming the chopped zucchini, carrots, banana pepper and tomatoes. When all the vegetables are almost tender, add the ingredients from the pressure cooker to the pot and let the ingredients cook together.\n\nReduce the heat to low, then add the sauce from the fridge and the balsamic vinegar to the pot. Stir the sauce slowly and thoroughly into the contents of the pot to prevent it from clumping. Let the stew cook for a little while, but only until it doesn't want to stick to the bottom of the pot. Then turn off the heat, stir the stew well and salt it to taste at the very end of cooking.\n\nIngredients for the bread:\n\n- 300 g wholemeal spelt flour\n- 200 g lacto-fermented red lentils\n- 50 g rye sourdough starter (50% hydration)\n- 500-550 ml water\n- 10 g salt\n\nThe lacto-fermented red lentils need to be blended with enough water to obtain a pleasant pancake batter-like consistency. Mix the dough with wholemeal spelt flour and add enough water to make the dough as thick as a dense but runny cream. This gives about 500-550 ml of water.\n\nAt this point, the dough is divided into two equal parts, one half goes into a jar and goes into the fridge. The other half remains in the mixing bowl, to which you add the sourdough starter and salt.\n\nCover the dough in the mixing bowl with an airtight lid and let it rest at room temperature for 2-3 hours. After that it goes into the fridge. The next day half of the saved dough in the jar is added and left again at room temperature for 2-3 hours, then it goes back into the fridge. The next day, feed the remaining dough in the same way as the day before, then put the dough back to the fridge. The next day, the dough should be left at room temperature for 2-3 hours before baking, after which the bread is ready to be baked.\n\nI started the baking at 210\u00b0C with a 10-minute cover, and then continued baking uncovered at 190\u00b0C for the remaining 25-30 minutes. Once the bread has cooled, you are ready to slice it.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ye81hnnha7be1.png", "created_utc": 1736093897.0, "score": 69, "author": "Amgarrak", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1huaitw/fermented_chickpea_and_cicerchia_stew_with/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Vegan Bloat -or- gastritis?", "selftext": "Hello! **8 years a vegan** as of November and feeling great. But the journey hasn't all been peaches and cream (err... plant-based cream \ud83d\ude05)\n\nSo here's the thing... I had perennial struggles with \"vegan bloat\", that awful (and common) feeling of belly pain after eating plant-based meals. I'd been trying to figure out how to solve it for years *dietarily*, but this year the symptoms got so bad I literally thought I had cancer.\n\nOne endoscopy later, turns out I had \\***gastritis** all along. \ud83e\udd26\n\n*\\*gerd and a hiatal hernia too*\n\nHere's the thing, *when* they put me on a low residue (i.e. low fiber) diet for the colonoscopy (that they also performed), I felt the best I had in years. I soon after [learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/kcnc3o/high_fiber_diet_or_low_fiber/) that for some people, gastritis is **helped by low fiber diets** and hindered by high fiber diets, although curiously *sometimes it's the reverse*. \ud83e\udd14\n\nThen I realized... yeaaaaaaah... vegan diets are generally very high in fiber.\n\n**Is high fiber the culprit**? Is it causing the so-called \"bloat\" for a lot of people?\n\nThat's something I've been wondering.\n\n# So, I did some research so I could stay vegan!\n\nSince then, I've adopted some very important changes to my diet:\n\n1. Swapping out whole grains for refined grains (i.e. now I bake with white flour and eat white rice).\n2. Swapping out lentils and beans for tofu and soy milk.\n3. Making sure my veggies/fruits get *cooked*, **cooked**, ***cooked!*** and *peeled*, **peeled**, ***peeled!***\n4. Mixing harsher condiments that would otherwise cause a \"flare up\" with olive oil (mild taste Pompeiian olive oil, non-extra virgin, is my recommendation).\n5. Avoiding other high fiber foods like citrus fruits.\n6. **\\*EDIT\\*** Also, curiously... adding a little bit of \"malt vinegar\" to water (when I drink water) seemed to help stave off any related heartburn. Malt vinegar is a very gentle vinegar, more tangy than burn-y.\n7. Generally following guidelines like these: [https://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/crohns-disease/low-residue-diet-foods](https://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/crohns-disease/low-residue-diet-foods)\n\nSo far, so good.

{"title": "Anyone else find family the hardest part?", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nMy husband and I have been (mostly) plant based for about 9 months. We still eat animal products a few times a month, mostly where it coincides with our social lives since WFPB is not always consistently an option everywhere. \n\nIn addition, we try to avoid processed foods. So in short, it's a good thing I love cooking, because I spend a good amount of time each week meal prepping largely from scratch. \n\nDespite this being work, I don't find the commitment that bad. I enjoy it, catch up on audiobooks, and cook in bulk to freeze and eat later. \n\nHowever, especially with the holidays + many family birthdays this month, I'm starting to get exasperated. We are from the Midwest, and our families are your standard meat and potatoes stock. Whole I don't expect anyone to cater to us, I am finding navigating this season very emotionally taxing for several reasons:\n\n- The events are often not \"potluck\" style, and on occasion when I've brought my own plant based dish it's viewed as rude\n\n- Events are often planned spontaneously or last minute, meaning I have minimal time to prep something (ex. Today we got 36 hr notice for a b-day party serving all meat Chinese takeout or processed freezer Chinese). So tonight, due to time constraints, I had to choose between getting a workout in or trying to throw something together quick that I can eat and others can try/share. \n\n- When I bring stuff to share, it often gets picked at and we bring most of it home, which means I spent more time preparing than needed. But if I ever bring a portioned out meal just for me/husband, comments get made about not sharing or being generous. It feels like we can't win either way. \n\n- Basically none of our families understand our view point or are extremely prone to fad diets, commenting on people's bodies, etc., so when people inevitably ask questions about what we brought and why, it feels like entering a discussion minefield. In the past, simply explaining my dietary preference when questioned has led to people commenting on my weight, etc, which is tough as I have a history of an ED. \n\n- Everybody says \"It's okay to indulge sometimes.\" Yes it is, but rarely a week goes but that multiple reasons to indulge don't occur! And trust me, I do, on the things I want and enjoy the most. But people act like showing any restraint is \"not letting yourself enjoy life\" UGH \n\nI could go on, but just curious if anyone else feels the same. We feel like we have an opportunity to lead and educate others, but sometimes it's so damn lonely and frustrating just to try and take care of yourself.

I have stretches where I go hard in the paint and stretches where I fall off the wagon and eat pizza like it\u2019s a requirement for health. It\u2019s never meat just cheese but way too much cheese. \n\nIt\u2019s June 2023 and I have a blood test. Not good. Total cholesterol - 274, triglycerides - 97 (okay trig is not bad), and LDL - 215. However my fasting glucose is a shiny 84. This is my hard on again hard off again phase. However I am on it. I go pretty low fat 10% - 15%, high carb. Lots of grains, beans, veggies, and tons of fruit. \n\nIt\u2019s now July of 2023. Been going hard for a month, time to test. Total cholesterol - 229, triglycerides - 139 (big jump), LDL - 166. Glucose is a less shiny but still decent 91.  \n\nI go back to on again off again because I can\u2019t seem to stay satisfied in my diet. It\u2019s more on again than off again, however. Fast forward I get a new doctor in September of this year and we test. Total cholesterol - 247, triglycerides - 134, LDL - 178. Glucose is still normal but barely at 99. Doctor is unhappy and is not having it and I\u2019m not happy either. I\u2019m put on a statin, and I really want to kick it into overdrive so I do the portfolio diet. \n\nFrom sept until today, my average diet is breakfast - 140 g tofu, 150 g hummus, 200 g broccoli, 200 g brussels sprouts. Lunch - 500 g cantaloupe, 30 g walnuts. Snack - 28 g natural pb and four slices of Ezekiel bread or 100 g (uncooked weight) red lentils with about 150 g combined broccoli/brussels sprouts . Dinner - 80 g oatmeal, 12 g flax seed, 15 g, date syrup, 100 g wild blueberries, and 1/2 cup of soy milk. All in all roughly 1900 calories, with an average of 249 total carbs, 55 g fiber, 80 g fat, and 93 g of protein. \n\nToday I test and get my lab results back. Total cholesterol - 154, triglycerides - 90, and LDL - 98. Not too shabby right? Here\u2019s the kicker, glucose - 110. Why can\u2019t I get it right? My cholesterol is coming down nicely but my fasting glucose is increasing at a concerning pace. \n\nTLDR, 15 months mostly WFPB 75/25. When on the diet, high carb low fat 10 - 15% fat) Cholesterol was never in acceptable levels but fasting glucose was great. However never really felt satisfied. \n\n3.5 months on portfolio diet and statin, my cholesterol is coming down to pretty decent levels but my fasting glucose is rising sharply. However, I am almost always satisfied. Do I stay on the higher fat diet (35% - 40%) and hope glucose comes down or is it triggering the sharp rise in glucose even though my cholesterol is basically at record low levels?

{"title": "My favorite foods after a year on a plant based diet, mostly whole and minimally processed", "selftext": "I thought I'd post some for inspiration of my favorite plant based meals after a year of following this diet pretty well. I see a lot of people confused on what to eat. \n\nFor reference, before the switch I was a very bad eater. I would have a pack of pop-tarts almost every day, regularly ate lots of meat and lots of non-whole grain carbs with limited veggies. I was raised on a very heavy meat and processed food diet and kept it up as it was what I was used to. Now I love what I eat and don't miss those foods at all. \n\nI'll also add: I am a big fan of 3 sort of specialty appliances appliances: rice cooker (mostly to make whole grain rice!), bread maker (I have fresh made bread almost every week), and an air fryer (used for tofu more than anything).\n\n# Favorite breakfasts:\n\nI'm a big breakfast guy. I have to have breakfast. Here are some of my go-to meals:\n\n* Peanut butter and banana sandwich: I use fresh bread or Ezekiel, or ocasionally the Ezekiel English muffins. Added with no sugar added peanut butter and banana. Sometimes I will use other nut butters to mix it up. \n* Yogurt: I'll use usually one of the no sugar added Kite Hill yogurts with whatever fruit I have (generally berries or bananas), a mix of seeds I have (flaxseed, chia seed, hemp hearts), and then a crunchy topping. Lately my goto has been grapenuts (a whole grain cereal).\n* Cereal: Soy milk (the green Silk is my favorite) with a whole grain cereal. Lately plain shredded wheat has been my go to, sometimes mixed with grapenuts. I occasionally add fruit but usually have it just like this.\n* Pancakes/waffles. Made with whole grain flour and oats. I make a big batch and then heat them up throughout the week. I add cinnamon and they are tasty plain, but sometimes I add a bit of yogurt on to them like butter.\n\n# Meals:\n* Tofu and rice bowls are my favorite. I will air fry tofu, and have brown rice. Sometimes I'll mix it with another grain like buckwheat or quinoa or other types of whole rice. I'll generally add some beans (usually just canned), some sort of green (like spinach or lettuce), a sauce (like hummus or shuug), and something crunchy on top (usually something chickpea based from the Indian grocer). I eat these for lunch most days with whatever combination we have available. Sometimes instead of tofu I will have air fryer falafel.\n* Tacos: I use corn tortillas. Can use lots of different veggies. Sometimes I use tofu, sometimes soy curls, sometimes just crispy potatoes and mushrooms. If I go for veggies I'll usually make a protein rich sauce like with silken tofu. Fresh salsa is also a plus. Sometimes I will use arepas instead. I get arepas and tortillas that are basically just corn and heat them in the air fryer.\n* \"Shrimp and grits\" inspired flavors where I will have grits or polenta with seasoned soy curls and beans on top. Also good with corn on the cob on the side.\n* Pasta dishes with whole grain or chickpea pasta with some other goodness added in. Tomato based ones, \"white\" ones made with cashews, etc.\n* Curries, especially those made with whole cashews and lentils for flavor. Usually with brown rice, sometimes I mix it with pasta to remix it later!\n* Also lots and lots of different types of soups. Chili, minestrone, various veggie stews, etc. They also go really well with cornbread, which I make with whole grain cornmeal. \n\n# Veggies\nThese go with the meals depending, but here are some veggies I've discovered I love now:\n\n* Brussel sprouts\n* Asparagus\n* I love lightly sauteed greens. Some favorites this way include kale greens, bok choy, broccolini. \n* Okra\n\nI used to like mushrooms, broccoli, green beans, and some others I still eat but I keep finding new ones I like. I try to get a new one to try pretty often, especially if I go to a grocery store with a more diverse selection. \n\nAlso, don't be afraid of potatoes and yams. There are so many good and healthy ways you can make them! \n\n# Meat substitutes\nMeat adds savoriness and it adds a more protein and fat rich foot to your plate. Except occasionally when out I don't do the reconstruction meats like Beyond Meat. My favorite things are tofu and soy curls. Soy curls are based on the whole soy bean. Tofu there are many kinds, and I sometimes will have non-soy based tofu when eating with a family member allergic to soy (usually fava bean based because it is available at my main grocery store, but I've also have pumpkin seed and chickpea/burmese tofu). \n\nBut lots of beans and lentils will also fill that niche, so I also will use those heavily throughout my diet! \n\nMushrooms are also good from a flavor perspective, but they don't have the same nutrition as meat. Mushrooms can be added to a dish to make it a lot more savory though. \n\n# Snacks:\n* Crackers (my favorite is Wasa Crispbread) with nut butter or hummus or something similar. \n* Chia seed pudding: mix chia seeds, soy milk, vanilla, and a little maple syrup. I've also done a pudding with blended silken tofu which is really good. \n* Fruit. I eat lots of fruit, especially after meals. My favorite right now for snacking are pears, granny smith apples, and mandarins.\n* Veggies and hummus. Favorites for this include celery, sweet peppers, carrots, and cauliflower. \n* Also I snack on fresh bread a lot. \n\n# Desserts\nSometimes I do make desserts. Here are some that are fairly low sugar/oil and can be quite good!\n\n* I make a lightly sweetened pumpkin dish that is basically like the inside of a pumpkin pie with less sugar. Canned pumpkin + a little bit of whole grain flour + plant milk + cinnamon are the main ingredients. Sometimes I add sugar free dark chocolate nibs. \n* Oatmeal \"cookie\" drops: Oatmeals + dates + maybe some nuts. You can make a similar one with bananas and oats too.\n\n# Eating out\nI try to avoid eating out too much. I typically go for Chipoltle/Moe's, Cava, or bowl places like Bowlero or Fresh Greens when I do eat out. The other go to are Thai, Indian, and Mediterranean restaurants which I find a little easier to find good options at. With Thai you have to worry about fish sauce if you are concerned about being vegan, with Indian you have to be careful about milk, and in all you have to be careful about too much oil, which is a tradeoff I am willing to make when eating out. I did do some travelling this year and went to places with lots of vegan options (NYC and UK were the big trips), but it was hard to fit into more whole foods in this time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hmphb2/my_favorite_foods_after_a_year_on_a_plant_based/", "created_utc": 1735223520.0, "score": 263, "author": "et-pengvin", "num_comments": 36, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hmphb2/my_favorite_foods_after_a_year_on_a_plant_based/", "html_title": ""}

Soybeans were first domesticated in ancient China and became a staple crop, spreading to other countries through trade and cultural exchanges over centuries. China was a global leader in science and technology for much of history. It was not until the 18th and 19th centuries, during the Industrial Revolution, that Western countries began surpassing China in industrial and technological advancement. This shift was partly due to the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty implementing policies to solidify their authority over the Han Chinese majority, which limited external influence and technological exchange, contributing to China\u2019s relative stagnation.\n\nFor most of China\u2019s history, the vast majority of the population was of the the peasant class, who relied on beans, especially soy, for nutrition, since most did not eat meat more often than a handful of times a year. Meat consumption was limited to wealthier segments of society and special occasions, meaning soybeans and other legumes were essential sources of protein for the broader population. This reliance highlights the nutritional importance of soybeans in sustaining large populations.\n\nLegumes, including soybeans, are fundamental to plant-based diets due to their high protein content and provision of lysine, an essential amino acid often lacking in other plant foods. While all beans provide high quality protein and lysine that nutritionally substitute those of meat, soy, in particular, is unique in multiple ways:\n\n1. Soy is a \u201ccomplete protein,\u201d containing all nine essential amino acids in sufficient amounts.\n2. Soy is also unique in that its Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) rivals that of animal-based proteins such as meat, eggs, and dairy - without all the harmful components in animal foods.\n3. Soy contains more protein than all other beans, per gram.\n4.

She put me on it due to gastrointestinal issues that include IBS and somewhat possible Crohn's. She thought it would calm my small and large intestine.\n\nThe benefits since then have been losing 30 lbs, elimination of arthritis pain, and more energy. Also, my cholesterol plummeted. The gastrointestinal discomfort wasn't completely resolved but it was more mild and digestion had improved.\n\nWe went on a cruise from 12/2 through 12/18. My doctor basically told me to cheat on the cruise and to get back on the diet when I returned. She reasoned that it would be very difficult to follow the diet on the ship.\n\nI have been dairy free for over 2 years because it became obvious that I'm extremely lactose intolerant at minimum and possibly allergic to or intolerant of other components in milk. So, that was a non-negotiable on the cruise.\n\nI did my best to avoid any dairy. I did drink alcohol and eat meat, fish, and eggs. The food and booze were wonderful but...\n\nWithin days of eating everything else but dairy, my gastrointestinal issues gradually returned. I had very loose stool, bad smelly gas, bloating, cramps in my gut, pain in my gut, and mild arthritis pain. I reasoned that some of the things I had eaten like saut\u00e9ed veggies and meat with sauces had stealth dairy. But, I did ask and was assured that my choices were dairy free. So, I'm not convinced that my symptoms were only because of dairy.\n\nI gladly went back to my WFPBD upon return on the afternoon of 12/18. Even in these very few days back on WFPBD, my digestion has improved and I have fewer aches and pains. The bloating went away. I still have some cramping but the cramping never completely resolved after 6 months of following a WFPBD before I went on the cruise. The cramping pre-cruise wasn't entirely constant and was mild.\n\nIn addition, I actually missed \"my food\" on the cruise and craved the things I had been eating on the WFPBD. I found that meat, fish, and eggs are not worth the gastrointestinal distress and arthritis pain they caused. I honestly don't miss eating animal products.\n\nSo, lesson learned. I'm sticking to a WFPBD for life. It's what is best for me. This experiment taught me about what I should be eating for my own optimal health and comfort.\n\nWill I have an occasional Scotch, glass of wine, cognac, etc.? Possibly.

During that time, I was on a statin but experienced many unpleasant effects from the dialysis itself along with the million other pills I had to take daily. After transplant, I could discontinue the statin since my health values including cholesterol were good. About one year later, much of the blood work values were starting to decline. Turns out my kidney was being rejected by my own body. Bummer. Luckily, the anti-rejection treatment was successful and I was able to keep the transplanted kidney.\n\n# Plant Based?\n\nAfter the anti-rejection treatment finished, my LDL cholesterol remained high (150 mg/dL) even though nearly everything else, including HDL and Triglycerides, were controlled. I was told I would need to go on a statin again but I wanted to try diet and exercise first. Most of my meals were cooked at home and started walking fast every day as that's the most intense exercise my transplanted kidney could handle. Really tried going for it. 3 months later, it barely moved. I was told they needed to see improvement on the next checkup otherwise I would need to go on a statin.\n\nI've always hated cooking with meat. The feeling of raw meat, the sliminess, the smell preparing and the smell of the \"diaper juice\" in the trash can, being careful not to cross contaminate everything, the cleanup, and the knowledge this was a real animal with feelings and thoughts just like us that was forced to be killed. But I hardly knew anything about plant focused food other than the occasional takeout tofu dishes.\n\n# Now We're Cooking\n\nIt started with meatless Mondays. Easy enough, I already enjoy tofu so I'll just make stir fries with it. Then meatless Thursdays. Then well, I need to learn more so I'm not cooking the same damn thing every week. I went a whole week not eating meat and meat products. I learned more about animal cruelty and the health benefits of a plant based diet. No way I could go back to eating meat now. Plant based everyday.\n\nThat kidney and cholesterol checkup was looming ahead. Did I make enough change? I was shocked to see it had **dropped 34 points** to 116 mg/dL in a relatively short amount time. Progress! Still not where I wanted to be but enough to convince the doctors that I didn't need to take a statin immediately. \n\nOther than a peak earlier this year where I was on an extended vacation where I didn't have access to non-processed plant based foods, my LDL has been slowly dropping. Today it reached 95 mg/dL, with my last big change limiting my saturated fats even more. I feel better than ever and my joy of cooking has grown even more.\n\nThank you r/PlantBasedDiet r/veganrecipes and ^(sometimes) r/vegan for the inspiration and support!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgd37961f38e1.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0dec8b4758fdd9321b9c65feec267d26ac494a8\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hixl0r/another_cholesterol_lowering_success_story/", "created_utc": 1734739837.0, "score": 105, "author": "beef-ster", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/1hixl0r/another_cholesterol_lowering_success_story/", "html_title": ""}
