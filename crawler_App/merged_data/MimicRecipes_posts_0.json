{"title": "Some Chipotle Info", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/gallery/zVAEwon\n\n\"I used to work prep at chipotle. The rice is just oiled right after being cooked, it's a cup and a half of oil for a single batch of rice, which is about 4 third pans, then each third pan is tossed with a third of a cup of citrus, which is just half lemon juice half lime juice, a cup of chopped cilantro, and 2 tablespoons of salt. For brown rice you cut the citrus and salt in half. We don't cook it with lemons or any strange stuff I've seen. That doesn't mean those methods are wrong, just that's not how it gets made at chipotle. We just washed it and dropped it with bay leaves, a single bay leaf will be more than enough for a home batch.\n\nAlso, running down the list: the chicken thigh marinade is a mixture of adobo, honey, salt, and a bit of oil, steak is just the adobo, and adobo is basically ground up paste made from chipotle peppers. That stuff josh had you mix up in the food processor was a kind of adobo with a lot of added flavor, if you're missing some of those ingredients that aren't the chili peppers, it's fine. Beans just get a healthy splash of lemon and a tablespoon of salt per third pan, pintos used to have bacon in them but they don't anymore. If you don't know how much you need, underseason and add it to taste. Fajita veg is just sliced onions and bell peppers thrown on the plancha or in a pan with a small amount of oil, salt, and oregano, and then leave them alone. Go do something else for at least 3-5 minutes. Don't touch them, don't move them. Don't add too much oil. You're trying to caramelize and even char them a bit, and they'll just turn out floppy and bad if you touch them. The plancha was hot enough to cook like 10 pounds of chicken thighs in less than 10 minutes, you will probably not burn them on your home stove unless you're a true maniac.\n\nA deep third pan are those long pans you see most stuff in when you go in. They're all based on hotel pans, a third pan is one third of a hotel pan, a sixth pan is one sixth of one and what we'd put sour cream, hot, and green salsas in, and they can be either deep or shallow. Rices and beans are in deeps, shallows are the ones that are about half as deep. When I left we were phasing out of using those because they didn't properly reach the hot water, so it was harder for them to keep temp.\n\nOh and just salt the fuck out of everything. Like just go ham. A deep third of chicken will get something like a third of a cup of salt on it when it's on the grill. That pan of guac, when it's full, has a full tablespoon of salt in it. The reason chipotle tastes good is we just use a shitload of salt. If yours at home doesn't taste as good, it's because you didn't add enough.\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/nvdn7g/some_chipotle_info/", "created_utc": 1623184300.0, "score": 264, "author": "general010", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/nvdn7g/some_chipotle_info/", "html_title": ""}

Anyone who has had it knows exactly what I mean. Salsa is typically fresh, earthy, and bears a resemblance to other salsas from other restaurants. But not Taco House. Their salsa has a rich, smoky flavor, with a dark complexity that has eluded me for years. Literally. \n\n\nBut today, I did it. I cracked the code. I found the secret ingredient: tomato paste. \n\n\n-\t8 heirloom tomatoes, halved\n-\t8 jalape\u00f1os, halved\n-\t12oz of pickled jalape\u00f1os*\n-\tgarlic powder\n-\tsalt\n-\t6oz of tomato paste\n\n\nPlace the tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os under the broiler, cut side up. Meanwhile, drain half the vinegar of the pickled jalape\u00f1os. *Note: the pickled jalape\u00f1os are key here. Find a brand that packages carrots and onions in the can with the peppers. Place all of the carrots, onions, and peppers into a blender. Add the garlic powder, salt, and tomato paste. If you want it as thin as the Taco House salsa, add two cups of water. When the tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os are sufficiently charred (they should be pretty black, don\u2019t be shy about it), add them to the blender. Pur\u00e9e until smooth. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: let the salsa sit overnight! It will not taste right straight out of the blender. I made it last night and tasted it right away, only to let out another disappointed sigh. But today, I opened the container to have a few chips, and the smell hit me like a nostalgic freight train. This is it, folks. \n\n\nAnd there you have it. A closely held secret finally revealed. My journey has ended, but it has also only just begun, as now I have to conquer the next challenge: the nachos.

Recipes below.\n\nI'm a cook at Panda Express. Something I've wanted to do for awhile now is figure out how to recreate Panda Express food at home as closely as possible to how it gets done in the restaurant. My 2 stipulations for it have been 1) use only the ingredients found on the ingredient labels of the products we get shipped to us, and 2) it has to only use stuff you could find at the average American supermarket. The only exceptions to the second rule being 1) chow mein noodles because you pretty much HAVE to go to an Asian market for the right kind, and 2) an Asian cooking wine that is non-essential and could be replaced with cheap Sherry cooking wine.\n\nThis is where help from any curious food adventurers comes in. I believe I have more or less figured out the recipe for Panda's \"Basic Cooking Sauce\", which opens up avenues to create a bunch of their dishes just based on that. Basic Cooking Sauce is a key component in their stir fry dishes, chow mein, and orange chicken. However, I'm not 100% sure in HOW close I've recreated it. I need some other Panda Express fans to try making it themselves at home, cooking with it, and telling me how close they think it is to the real thing. I will post a couple recipes down below, and if any of you are so inclined, please make them for yourselves sometime and let me know how close you think they are to the actual Panda Express dishes. Warning: it IS a fair bit of prep work and it will leave some leftover ingredients for future use...or waste.\n\n [Recipes I am making for Chow Mein, Kung Pao, and Honey Sesame Chicken Breast](https://imgur.com/a/hkJvbJR). I have made the Chow Mein and Kung Pao and thought they were pretty close, but  I haven't made the Honey Sesame yet and I uploaded that by mistake. So make that one at your own risk.

Combined, pressed into pan, froze until solid, and layered between two 9\u201d chocolate cakes and two layers of hot fudge.\n\nThe trick was to crumble the cookies by hand to get a pebbly texture rather than cookie dust. I went a little heavier on the butter so it would stay adhered while being between cake rather than ice cream. And freezing the cake until serving was a must so the crumble layer stayed in-tact.\n\nBut that was it!

{"title": "Perfected Quiznos Chicken Carbonara", "selftext": "I've spent years mourning the loss of nearly all quiznos' within a 3-4 state radius, I finally decided to hunt down the recipe for how to recreate my favorite quiznos sandwich, the chicken carbonara.. Now there's a lot of people out there with their own take on it, some simply using a pre-made alfredo base, others trying to make it from scratch.. But the best I found was in this sub-reddit, in a really loosely written recipe by a pro-chef here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/3j484w/comment/hmqw9v9/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/3j484w/comment/hmqw9v9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nBeing extremely light on the details I decided to take up the challenge to re-write the recipe and figure it out from scratch and here's the end result ::::\n\nonly thing i would add at this point is more salt/garlic at the tail end while it's still hot. hard to tell because it's still cooling right now and the final taste hasnt\u00a0come out of it yet but it can definitely use a bit more salt to be closer to what quiznos had. could possibly add it when cooking the bacon and using the bacon fat for the roux\n\nMade a classic mornay (with garlic and shallot and thyme added into the fat/grease) before adding roux then used parmesan and pecorino for the cheeses. Added chopped bacon, a good crack of black pepper, and heres the secret - italian dressing.\n\nIngredients\n\n4 tablespoons bacon fat/grease from cooking the bacon, divided (3/1 tbs)\n\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n\n3 cups whole milk, warm but not hot, divided (2.5/.5 cups)\n\n2 ounces grated Pecorino cheese\n\n2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese\n\n1 Cup Chopped Bacon\n\n2 Cloves Garlic finely sliced\n\n1/2 Clove Shallot finely sliced\n\nsalt / pepper / garlic salt to taste\n\n1/3-1/2 cup italian dressing to taste\u00a0\n\nfinely chopped fresh thyme\n\nSteps to Make It :\n\n\\-Gather your ingredients.\n\n\\-In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add bacon fat/grease over medium-low heat until free flowing. add 2 cloves garlic, finely sliced1/2 shallot finely sliced & fresh thyme\u00a0\n\nbrown spices 2-3 minutes.\n\n\\-Stir in the flour to form a roux. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until most of the water has cooked out (it will bubble less), which also allows the raw flour taste to cook off.\n\n\\-Slowly add 2 1/2 cups of the warm milk while whisking or stirring constantly so that the liquid is incorporated into the roux without forming lumps. bring to a simmer (do not let the milk boil or curd over).\n\n\\-Strain any solids. Return the sauce to the pan. Add the Pecorino and Parmesan cheeses and stir until the cheese has melted.

{"title": "Copycat Chick-Fil-A Nuggets!", "selftext": "Alright, so after my post yesterday with the lembas bread recipe flopped, I decided to judge the content of this recipe more thoroughly, and it checks out. I have to admit to you that I'm not really a foodie, I just enjoy helping reddit communities grow. I do enjoy eating very much, but I suck at cooking. \n\n However, my friend is a chef, and she said this one looks good. She mentioned that while mixing the pickle juice and milk with the chicken, it'll be difficult to keep it from curdling. But she mentioned its similar to a homemade buttermilk, so it's not impossible.\n\nRegardless, this post is to feature how I see future posts in this subreddit. I  proposed a significant  change to posting rules in my discussion thread, so I want to be clear how that change would look, and what it means.\n\n I'd like to set this subreddit to self-post-only mode. Blog posts and such will still be welcome. Pictures of food will still be welcome. But the body of the post will need to include a recipe, and it will no longer be possible to just post a link. After all, this is a recipe subreddit, so we're trying to bring recipes to reddit, not just send our subscribers off-site.\n\nWithout further ado, the recipe:\n\n---\n\n##[Copycat Chik-Fil-A Nuggets](http://imgur.com/a/RDPbX)\n\n####[From DamnDelicious.net](http://damndelicious.net/2014/07/18/copycat-chick-fil-nuggets/)\n\nYield: 4 servings\n\nPrep time: 50 minutes\n\nCook time: 10 minutes total\n\nTotal time: 1 hour\n\n**_Just like Chick-Fil-A, but it tastes 10000x better! And the homemade honey mustard is out of this world!_**\n\n---\n\n###INGREDIENTS:\n\n- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks\n\n- 1 cup dill pickle juice\n\n- 1 1/2 cups milk, divided\n\n- 1 cup peanut oil\n\n- 1 large egg\n\n- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n\n- 1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar\n\n- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n\n####FOR THE HONEY MUSTARD\n\n- 1/4 cup mayonnaise\n\n- 2 tablespoons honey\n\n- 1 tablespoon mustard\n\n- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n\n- 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n\n---\n\n>###DIRECTIONS:\n\n>1. To make the honey mustard, whisk together mayonnaise, honey, mustards and lemon juice in a small bowl; set aside.\n\n>2. In a large bowl, combine chicken, pickle juice and 1/2 cup milk; marinate for at least 30 minutes. Drain well.\n\n>3. Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.\n\n>4. In a large bowl, whisk together remaining 1 cup milk and egg. Stir in chicken and gently toss to combine; drain excess milk mixture.\n\n>5. In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken, flour and confectioners\u2019 sugar; season with salt and pepper, to taste.\n\n>6. Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n>7. Serve immediately with honey mustard.\n\n>Adapted from [Mandy\u2019s Recipe Box](http://www.mandysrecipeboxblog.com/2012/12/copycat-chick-fil-nuggets.html)\n\n---\n\n_While any deep-fried food is an indulgent choice, making these yourself ensures quality ingredient control. This recipe uses whole chicken breast; a lean source of high quality protein. Some chicken nuggets are made from processed meats, which are typically higher in fat and sodium._\n\n_Nutritional information is available in the source article and provided by Jessica Penner, RD at Smart Nutrition._\n\n---\n\nSo let me know what you think about my proposal to set r/MimicRecipes to self-post-only  mode, and also what you think about this recipe. I like this one because every  time Ive wanted to get Chik-Fil-A, it's Sunday and they're closed. \n\nFinally, I can enjoy it on my own schedule.

Enjoy this one in the meanwhile. :)", "selftext": "Edit - I stand corrected. Panda Express has Cream Cheese Rangoon, no crab apparently. Sorry about that guys.  I feel like I am in some sort of a parallel universe.

So, I thought why not also make some Crab Rangoon to go along! Picture link to Imgur and a video link will be in comments, if someone needs it for the folding technique. :)\n\nRecipe:\n\nThis recipe will make between 12-16 Rangoon/s depending on the size of your won-ton wrappers. Here is what you will need for this recipe:\n\nFor the Crab Rangoon/s:\n\n1. Won-ton wrappers, 12-16 sheets. Can be found in any grocery store.\n2. Canned crab, rinsed and dried: 4 oz\n3. Cream cheese, plain: 4 oz\n4. Scallions, finely chopped: green parts of 2-3 sprigs\n5. Garlic, minced: 1 clove\n6. Fish Sauce: 1 tsp\n7. Soy sauce: 1 tsp\n8. Oil, to deep fry: about 500 ml\n\nFor the dipping sauce:\n\n1. Sriracha: 1 Tbsp\n2. Sweet N' Sour Sauce: 2 tbsp\n3. Rice vinegar or white vinegar: 1.5 tbsp\n4. Brown sugar: 1.5 tsp\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Rinse crab in cold running water and allow to dry.\n2. Take room-temp cream cheese in a bowl and whip it with a rubber spatula until it is smooth.\n3. Add the crab, chopped scallions, minced garlic, fish sauce, and soy sauce to this and mix well. Be gentle as to not break the lumps of crab but also try to mix thoroughly.\n4. Rest in the fridge for 30 mins.\n5. In the meantime, make dipping sauce by combining all ingredients in a bowl. Whisk until sugar dissolves.\n6. Once the crab mix is rested enough, take it out of the fridge and allow to come to room temp for a few mins.\n7. Take your won-ton wrappers out of the pack and cover with damp paper towel. Keep covered all through the rest of the process and take out only what is being used. Bonus tip: Unused wrappers can be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in the freezer.\n8. Take a sheet and place 1 tsp of the mix in the center. Form shape of your choice.Optional - To replicate the shapes I made, refer to the video on YT, timestamp 2:08. Youtube/HonestCooks\n9. Keep covered with damp paper towels.\n10. Deep fry on medium until golden.\n11. Serve with dipping sauce. :)\n\nThanks for reading and thanks to those who considered supporting my channel \\[named Honest Cooks\\].

{"title": "Attempting to recreate Panda Express cooking sauces at home", "selftext": "Since I became a cook at Panda Express I've wanted to make all the food at home. I already know the basic recipes for everything, but the thing I couldn't know was how to recreate the sauces. That's because the sauces are based on the Basic Cooking Sauce, which the recipe for isn't exactly public information.\n\nWell, I looked on the side of the [bucket](https://imgur.com/mxoO9rE) to see what the ingredients were. Ignore all the commercial chemicals and you've got water, sugar (high fructose corn syrup), soy sauce, salt, ginger, and ground white pepper. Since ingredients are listed from most used to least used, that gives me the smallest idea on the proportions.\n\nI tried experimenting with those ingredients a little. I brought home a cup of the Basic Cooking Sauce to sip from for reference.  1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup ginger soy sauce, 1/4 cup salt, and 1 tsp ground white pepper. It's not completely perfect, but I think I'm starting to get close to recreating the Basic Cooking Sauce. Anyone else want to throw their hat into the game here and see if they can help me recreate it? So far my recreation tastes a little more biting than the actual sauce I think. Maybe less white pepper? If I can get the Basic Cooking Sauce down, recreating the stir fry and orange chicken sauces will just be a problem of sizing down ratios since the other parts of the recipe for them are on a [chart](https://imgur.com/lA6PCUU). I'd appreciate multiple peoples input at this to make sure the recreation is right...and so I can stop having to sip so much cooking sauce because this stuff is strong enough to make you shudder on its own. I have to keep a glass of water with me to wash out my mouth.\n\nFor those of you who don't work at Panda Express, you can ask them to give you a cup of the chow mein sauce and they'll give you some of the Basic Cooking Sauce.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/bdacwz/attempting_to_recreate_panda_express_cooking/", "created_utc": 1555292232.0, "score": 137, "author": "redgroupclan", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/bdacwz/attempting_to_recreate_panda_express_cooking/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Another take on a Wendy's Frosty", "selftext": "A couple days ago, someone posted a recipe for a Frosty that involved sweetened condensed milk and Cool Whip. I commented with a rough recipe that I had not tested. Now I have, and I offer you my take:\n\n* 2 tablespoons cocoa powder\n* 1 tablespoon powdered sugar\n* 1-2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum\n* pinch salt\n* 1 cup (8oz) milk (I used 2%, but you could do anything, including nondairy)  \n* 2 cups ice cubes\n\nAdd all ingredients except ice cubes to a blender and blend on high until incorporated. Add the ice cubes and blend on high until thick. My blender has a stick to stir, and that came in handy; you may have to stop and scrape it down if yours does not.\n\nNotes: Alternately, use chocolate milk in place of cocoa, sugar, and milk. I used on the low end on the sugar and it was fine for me, but if you want more like the real deal, load 'er up. More xanthan gum would make it thicker, but too much and it will get gummy; 1/2 teaspoon left it loose, but still creamy.\n\nXanthan gum is an emulsifier/thickener/stabilizer made from fermented bacteria. It's used frequently at home in gluten-free baking to sorta mimic the action of gluten in wheat flour. Here, it makes the frosty into a creamy emulsion without adding much else extra. They carry it in my normal grocery store - look on the baking aisle in the alternative flours area - but somewhere like Whole Foods or Amazon would definitely have it. I got a $12 bag of Bob's Red Mill that will last me at least a year, and I use it a lot.\n\nWendy's Canadian site [lists their ingredients](https://menu.wendys.com/en_CA/product/chocolate-frosty/) as: Milk, Sugar, Glucose, Cream, Whey Powder, Skim Milk Powder, Cocoa, Guar Gum, Mono and Diglycerides, Cellulose Gum, Carrageenan, Calcium Sulfate, Sodium Citrate, Dextrose, Natural Flavour.

{"title": "[Mimic] As promised, after the Rangoons, I bring you Panda Express style Firecracker Shrimp. :)", "selftext": " Even if you don't love shrimp as much as Bubba from Forrest Gump, you will still LOVE this firecracker shrimp recipe recreation from Panda Express. The vegetables are coated with a delicious, spicy sauce and the shrimp is cooked to perfection. Served with garlic noodles, there is no better meal for a weekend-in!\n\nHere is what you will need to replicate \n\n1. Shrimp: 1 lb. \\[26x30\\] \n\n2. Bell peppers, mixed colors: 5-6 oz, cut into squares \n\n3. Green beans: 3-4 oz, 1-inch pieces \n\n4. White onion: 3-4 oz, cut into slices \n\n5. Scallions: about 2-3 sprigs, finely chopped \n\n6. Ginger: 2-inch piece \n\n7. Garlic: 6-8 cloves \n\n8. Green Thai Chilies: 4 pcs \n\n9. Dry Red Chili: 6 pcs - soak 3 for chili paste and use other 3 dry in sauce \n\n10. AP flour and water: 1 tbsp each, to make slurry \n\nFor frying the shrimp: \n\n1. Salt/pepper: to taste \n\n2. AP Flour: 2 tbsp, to coat the shrimp \n\n3. Egg whites: 1/2 cup \n\n4. Oil, to fry \n\nFor base sauce: \n\n1. Honey: 1 tbsp \n\n2. Sriracha: 1.5 tbsp \n\n3. Rice vinegar: 1.5 tbsp\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clean your shrimp and add salt/ pepper and AP flour to it. Mix well and set aside for \\~20 mins.\n\n2. In the meantime, have the vegetables ready.\n\n3. Make a coarse paste of green chili, ginger, garlic, and (soaked) dry red chili.\n\n4. In another bowl, make a slurry with AP flour and water. Set aside.\n\n5. In yet another bowl, mix honey, sriracha, and vinegar. Mix and set aside. We want to have all the prep done before cooking. \n\n6. When 20mins have passed, fry shrimp by first dipping in seasoned egg whites and then dropping in hot oil. Turn and cook on both sides until golden and cooked through. Drain and set aside.\n\n7. To start making the sauce and bring the dish together, take a wide pot, or a wok if you have one, and add sesame oil or any other oil you have.\n\n8. When the oil is smoking, add dry red chilies \\[whole\\] and the ginger garlic chili paste that was made earlier. Cook till the raw smell goes off. Stir often and keep heat medium to high.\n\n9. Add white onions and cook until the crunch is gone. Add water to deglaze pan if needed.\n\n10. Add other vegetables, EXCEPT scallions. Cook until crunchiness goes away.\n\n11. Add the sauce mix and slurry to this. The sauce will thicken as soon as slurry goes in. So, keep stirring.\n\n12. When the sauce is thick, add the previously fried shrimp and mix well to coat it with sauce.\n\n13. Garnish with scallions and serve with garlic noodles.\n\n14.

Made properly, they are almost indistinguishable. I add a tiny bit of lemon juice (1/4 t) to the frosting, to cut the sweetness, which I know Cinnabon does as well. \n\nKennon-Green Version of Cinnabon Cinnamon Roll Dough\n\n1 cup warm milk\n\n2 eggs, room temperature\n\n1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted\n\n4 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 cup white sugar\n\n1 package yeast (1/4 ounce)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKennon-Green Version of Cinnabon Cinnamon Roll Filling\n\n1 cup brown sugar, packed\n\n2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon\n\n1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKennon-Green Version of Spread for Cinnamon Roll Dough\n\n1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKennon-Green Version of Cinnabon Cinnamon Roll Icing\n\n3 oz cream cheese, softened\n\n1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened\n\n1 1/2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar\n\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n\n### Kennon-Green Version of Cinnabon Cinnamon Roll Recipe Instructions\n\nMicrowave the milk for 45 to 60 seconds. Then, dissolve yeast in warm  milk in a large bowl. Add sugar, butter, salt, eggs, and flour. Mix  well. Dust your hands lightly with flour and then hand knead the  cinnamon roll dough into a large ball.\n\nPut the ball of dough into a bowl that is sprayed with cooking spray.  \u00a0Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place  for roughly 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size. \u00a0We turned the  oven on and then put the cinnamon roll dough on top of the stove. \u00a0The  heat generated caused the dough to rise.\n\nOnce your dough has risen, it\u2019s time to move on to the next step. \u00a0In  a new, small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter. \u00a0Mix them  well. \u00a0Spray a flat surface with cooking spray or sprinkled flour.  \u00a0Roll out your dough ball into a 16\u2033 x 21\u2033 rectangle roughly 1/4 inches  thick then spread a 1/4 cup of softened butter on the dough. \u00a0Next,  sprinkle the rolled, buttered dough evenly with the  sugar/cinnamon/butter mixture you prepared in your small bowl.\n\nRoll up the dough starting with the longer side and cut into fourteen  (14) cinnamon rolls (or more smaller rolls, if you prefer). Place the  cinnamon rolls in a lightly greased\u00a011\u2033 x 15\u2033 glass baking dish.

Prepare the candy:\n\n  Line a jelly roll pan (a 1/2 sheet pan) with a silicon mat and preheat oven to 200\u00b0 F.\n\n  In a medium pot, combine water, molasses, corn syrup, sugar and vanilla bean seeds. Set over medium heat and stir gently with a fork, taking care not to splash, until sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer. Simmer, undisturbed, until the mixture reaches between 280 and 290\u00b0F on a candy thermometer. Due to the molasses, the mixture will have a sketchy burning smell, but remain within the recommended temperatures and rest assured that it\u2019s not actually burning. Cooking molasses just smells funky.\n\n  While the syrup is cooking, grind the peanuts and powdered sugar together in a food processor until the mixture forms a thick, damp mass with a texture like wet sand. Set aside.\n\n  When the syrup comes to temperature, immediately pour the mixture onto the silicon mat in the sheet pan, taking care to keep the syrup within the center of the mat. Wearing a pair of oven mitts, tilt the pan left and right to help the syrup evenly coat the silicon mat into a roughly 14\u201d by 10\u201d rectangular shape.\n\n  You can fold the candy back over on itself if any places flow out too far.\n\n2. Layer the candy:\n\n If you\u2019ve ever laminated dough, this will be a familiar process; if not, imagine this next step as folding a business letter in thirds.\n\n Sprinkle the ground peanut mixture in an even a layer over 2/3 of the candy.\n\n Use the silicon mat to fold the unsprinkled section up and over the center of the candy, just like the first fold of a business letter. If the candy sticks to the silicon, it\u2019s still too hot. Wait a few moments for it to cool, then peel the silicon away; no rush. Now fold this double-thick section up and over the remaining piece. You will now have a 3 layer candy packet roughly 11\u201d x 5\u201d.\n\n Place the sheet pan in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until the candy has become warm and pliable. Remove it from the oven and lift out the silicon mat, setting it on the counter. Use a rolling pin to gently roll it out to a 14\u201d x 10\u201d rectangle; it will take some elbow grease. If at any time the candy begins to make a cracking sound, or feels too stiff to roll, return the pan to the oven for a minute or two. Take your time! Once you\u2019ve rolled it out, fold it into thirds again just as you did the first time.\n\n Return the candy to the oven for another 4 minutes, then roll back out to a 14\u201d x 10\u201d rectangle. Sprinkle this rectangle with corn flakes, as you did with the peanut mixture. Fold into thirds (if, while folding the candy makes a cracking noise, stop folding and return it to the oven for about a minute, then proceed with folding). Return folded packet to the oven for another 4 minutes.\n\n3. Cut the candy into bars:\n\n Now roll the candy to 1/2\u201d thickness and then transfer to a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to trim the edges, leaving a tidy rectangle behind. You may be able to immediately cut the candy into 10 long, thin bars. But you may find you need to return it to the oven for a minute or two. This generally depends on the temperature of the kitchen. \n\n4. Crumb coat the bars:\n\n Due to the extreme flakiness of the candy, it\u2019s important to \u201ccrumb coat\u201d the candy bars before dipping in chocolate. Do this by tempering 12 ounces of chocolate. Drizzle or pipe a thin line of chocolate onto the bottom of each candy piece and then flip each over to form a foot on the bottom. Next, drizzle a little chocolate over each bar and use a small pastry brush to evenly coat the bar in a thin layer of chocolate. \n\n5. Dipping the bars:\n\n Once the chocolate has set, temper the remaining chocolate and dip each bar. Store the finished bars in an airtight container, indefinitely.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/5fjgnu/serious_eats_17_sweet_copycat_recipes_to_indulge/", "created_utc": 1480435865.0, "score": 117, "author": "blamsberg", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/5fjgnu/serious_eats_17_sweet_copycat_recipes_to_indulge/", "html_title": ""}

Whisk together the melted butter and 2 eggs, then sieve in the flour, powdered sugar and pinch of salt.\n2. Starting from the edge, start whisking the wet and the dry together, incorporating the dry ingredients slowly.\n3. Add the milk in 3 additions, mixing in between each.\n4. Sieve the pancake mixture into a pourable jug\n5. Use a tissue to lightly grease a non stick frying pan and preheat to medium heat.\n6. Pour the pancake mix into the centre of the the frying pan, enough to cover all but 1-2 inches of the outer edge of the pan (the batter is very watery so it should be a pretty thin layer).\n7. Immediately start moving the pan in circular motions to evenly distribute the batter to the edges of the pan. Keep the motion in one direction.\n8. Once spread out, cover with a lid (if you don't have one don't worry it'll just take longer to cook) and let it cook until air pockets start rising.\n9. Remove from the pan and place on a plate to cool (the pancake should not have taken on any colour, it will be an even pale yellow colour and slightly translucent).\n10. Repeat for all of the batter. Separate each pancake with a small piece of tissue.\n11. Prepare the cream filling: whip the double/heavy cream with the optional sugar and vanilla extract until medium peaks form. It should still be glossy and spreadable but able to hold it's shape.\n12. Cut the two halves of your mango and peel off the skin. If you want the shape to be neat you can slice of the rounded edges (chef snack?) and top to make it into a rectangle. Slice it into 3 rectangular pieces. If you're not fussed about the shape of the pancakes, also use the edge pieces of the mango.\n13. Take one pancake and place it glossy side down (there will be a glossy and a rough side, the rough side is the one that was in contact with the pan).\n14. Spread a 1-2cm layer of cream a little larger than your mango slice in the middle of the pancake. Place the mango onto it and cover with the same amount of cream, smoothing it out so it covers the mango.\n15. Fold one of the edges parallel to the longer side of the mango over, fold the opposite edge so it's wrapped up tightly. The pancake is pretty elastic so shouldn't break easily. (you can see the folding method at 4:00 in the video! I hope it's clear enoguh)\n16. Fold the two long edges left over in and turn it over so the folded edges are on the bottom.\n17. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before slicing open and enjoying. If you freeze them they turn into these amazing creamy mango ice cream bars!

I've stalked the aisles of the three asian markets I have available in a 100 mile radius. I even asked the lady at the Chinese place do they buy them pre-made, or how do they make them. She was less than forthcoming.   \nSo far, I have a couple of tentative feelers for the dumplings - I'll link a picture of both sauce and dumplings in the comments tomorrow. The dumplings have only pork and appear to have no veg inside, the wrapper is fairly thick and ridged (like [so](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/e8/2c/58e82c08fee9e9a9a5b928793d641012.jpg) ). They are pan fried and the menu usually also offers a steamed version of the same thing.  \nAccompanying them is always the same unbelievable sauce, which has been much harder for me to locate even a hint of. It's dark brown but not overly salty, with the strongest flavor being a garlic note. There are usually 3 or 4 artful scallions rings floating in there, not sesame seeds like I see most places. It goes with the dumpling flavor so unbelievably well.  \nIf you could help me out that would be great, all I can think about some days is dumplings, but I can't afford to be going to the chinese place an hour away from home (only place I've found them in this city so far) every day. So far all my attempts at any food outside of the stuff I've grown up with has been a complete and utter failure (the tofu stank up the house for days).

But I come before you today with the most dire of emergencies at hand -- my favorite dipping sauce is **discontinued!**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/qiN5ssH\n\nThis is Red Robin's \"ghost chili\" sauce, used on their Fiery Ghost burger. I use it as a dipping sauce. I think it's absolutely perfect for fries and such, and it was my favorite thing about the restaurant! Just the right flavor and heat, goes well with steak fries, and it never seems to get old. It's been part of my Saturday ritual for years.\n\nUnfortunately, it's being discontinued. Which means this container, this small container in my fridge, is the last of it I'll ever have. Unless, of course... I figure out how they make it, or where they got it from?\n\nI don't even know where to start with identifying possible ingredients in this sauce, but absolutely anything helps. If I have to spend the next year trying to replicate this, I will. I've included high-definition photos from multiple angles, and I hope that's a good starting point. I'll answer any questions any of you have.\n\nObservations that might help:\n\n- It's on the thicker side of most hot sauces, it stays on fries without dripping unless you jostle it. It behaves a bit like ranch, I think, maybe a little thinner?\n- It doesn't seem to be related to Frank's Red Hot, which is used in other RR sauces (like the Buzz sauce).\n- Sometimes there are solid bits of vegetable in it, but they're usually too small to identify. Slightly transparent, whitish. Onion? Garlic?\n- I do think it's actually using ghost peppers, though they seem very diluted. The sauce has that 'building' property that seems unique to them. (I can usually tell ghost apart from habanero, etc.)\n\nThank you in advance! <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/c4hdc9/what_ingredients_might_be_in_this_discontinued/", "created_utc": 1561345272.0, "score": 84, "author": "BabyFluttershy", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/c4hdc9/what_ingredients_might_be_in_this_discontinued/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Souplantation revelations", "selftext": "So as an avid Souplantation fan since childhood, and a big fan of cooking, I have spent a lot of time researching copycat recipes. Most are completely off-base. So I thought I would share some tips for anyone who loved their classic chickken noodle soup, their house ranch dressing, or their blueberry muffins. These were my favorites, and after experimenting I think I've cracked the secret to duplicating the taste.\n\nChicken Noodle Soup:\n\nBroth- The key to their soup is that they don't use classic broth (at least in my opinion). I believe they make what is called a chicken consomme. This is essentially a clarified chicken broth. Now if you have ever had clarified butter, you will know how much more flavorful it is than regular butter. Likewise, consomme is going to give you that incredibly potent chicken flavor, and that golden yellow hue. A huge part of making consomme, is taking home made broth and filtering it through whipped egg whites. You can easily google chicken consomme recipes that will get you that perfect souplantation broth you are looking for. Typically, I buy a roasted chicken from the grocer. I remove all the meat and set it aside for later. Then I boil down the carcass in water for a few hours. (Sometimes I add carrot, garlic, celery etcetera). Then I remove all solid. Now I bring the stock back up to temp and pour in the egg white whip/meringue. I whip them in, and then let it boil without whipping for 15 minutes. Eventually fluffy brown clouds form on the surface and I spoon them out. Once clear, this is my consomme. I add my home made noodles, and cook for 20 minutes. Add chicken. serve. \n\nNoodles- Souplantation made pretty classic home made noodles with one trick. White pearl bread flour. You can get this online and at nice baking supply stores. But you can also just use regular white flour of you prefer. Add 1 cup flour (sifted), one beaten egg, 2 Tbl milk and 1/2 tsp salt to a bowl. Mix until a ball forms. Roll the ball out very thin. Let sit 20 minutes. Now cut dough into thin strips just a bit smaller than you want your noodles to be. Let sit and \"dry\" for two hours. Now they are ready to be dropped into the consomme.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRanch Dressing:\n\nEvery thread I have read on the house dressing basically just says to put a ranch packet into good mayo and buttermilk. I greatly disagree with this. I'm actually not a huge ranch fan. Souplantation was the only ranch dressing I ever really loved. And it is tangy. So here's my take. Dont buy buttermilk. Make immitation buttermilk. This means pouring a large lemon's juice into regular milk and letting it sit for ten minutes. Stir, add mayo (I use veganaise because I prefer the flavor, but any mayo will do). Now add some of your packet (or if you prefer to make your own drief herb mix even better). Throw this back kin the fridge and let the flavors blend for an hour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlueberry Muffins:\n\nOne tip and one tip only. I heard through the grapevine that Souplantation made their muffins with fresh blueberries AND imitation blueberry extract. Ever since I heard this, I started doing so myself and it is a dead ringer for their recipe. So delicious. And remember, absolutely know crumble on top. Souplantation muffins don't need it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast but not least The Pizza Bread:\n\nThis one is easy to mimic. Buy some pre-made focaccia bread, or make it yourself. Top with pizza sauce, four cheese blend and an extra but of parmesan. I like to rub a cut piece of garlic all over the bread before topping it with sauce for an extra bit of bite. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, hope this helps other Souplantation fans recreate their favorite meals. We miss you Souplantation!\n\n\\-May", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/pe8ouf/souplantation_revelations/", "created_utc": 1630288725.0, "score": 79, "author": "bifbangpow", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/pe8ouf/souplantation_revelations/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Mimic \"crazy feta\" dip from Cava (Mediterranean restaurants in DC area)", "selftext": "Yield: makes about 2 cups [a little goes a long way!]\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 bricks of feta cheese, 8 ounces each\n3 whole jalapeno peppers\n1/4 cup olive oil + 1 tablespoon\n1 bulb garlic\nthe juice of half a lemon\nthe zest of half a lemon\nsalt and pepper\n\n\nDirections:\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Chop the top off the garlic bulb and drizzle it with a teaspoon of olive oil. Wrap it in foil and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until garlic is golden in color. At the same time, brush the jalapenos with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Either grill or roast them - I stuck them in the oven with garlic and just watched until they were charred. Remove both from oven and let cool. Once jalapenos are cooled, remove skins, cut in half and discard the seeds. Chop into small pieces. Don't touch your eyes!\n\nIn a large bowl, crumble the feta bricks. [Crumbling the bricks yourself works best, but if you can only find crumbled feta that is fine.] \nAdd chopped jalapenos, the zest of half a lemon, and the juice of half a lemon.\nSqueeze the roasted garlic out of the bulb directly into the feta. \nAdd 1/4 cup of olive oil and mash with a fork. \n\nYou want the feta to be a bit \"wet\" - I can best describe it as a cross between a spread and a dip. There is no right or wrong - make it however you'd like. Taste the feta and season with salt and pepper. \n\nServe with pita chips, warm pita or naan, or spread it on sandwiches. Store it in the fridge for up to one week - I find that I like it best at room temperature, so allow it to sit out for about 30 minutes before serving. We also think it would be great with some kalamata olives.\n\nSource: http://www.howsweeteats.com/2011/06/creamy-feta-dip/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/5b4hxy/mimic_crazy_feta_dip_from_cava_mediterranean/", "created_utc": 1478276386.0, "score": 80, "author": "Not_that_kind_of_DR", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/5b4hxy/mimic_crazy_feta_dip_from_cava_mediterranean/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Cook for 50 seconds, agitating occasionally with wire mesh spider, then remove to second paper-towel lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining potatoes (working in two more batches), allowing oil to return to 400\u00b0F after each addition. Allow potatoes to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

{"title": "San sauce from \"here comes the Sun\" in Miami Florida", "selftext": "\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI present you with a mystery that has been haunting me for over a decade. I was told by a trustworthy and reliable source that you fine folks possess the investigative skills necessary to perhaps help me crack this case. It deals with food \u2013 more specifically, a sauce.\n\nI used to frequent a restauramt in North Miami, Flordia, called\u00a0Here Comes the Sun. It was a hole-in-the-wall healthfood joint owned and operated by one man (who later passed it on to his son when he\u00a0died). The restaurant was famous in South Florida. One of the menu items they were most famous for was their homemade\u00a0Sun Sauce.\u00a0The recipe was kept a secret.\n\nI fell in love with this restaurant and started giving them large amounts of my money (didn\u2019t have that much to begin with) in exchange for their delicious food. I became obsessed with the Sun Sauce. I found that I could put it on anything and make it unbelieveably delicious. First I frequented the restaurant, then I started ordering delivery at least once or twice a week for roughly a year.\n\nEventually I wanted to try and make my own\u00a0Sun\u00a0Sauce so I called the restarant and asked the owner what the sauce\u2019s ingredients were. He clearly had the list memorized and started listing them out. They\u00a0were\u00a0(supposedly) as follows:\n\nSilken tofu\nMellow white miso paste\nGround fennel seed\nGround mustard seed\nApple civer vinegar\nApple juice concentrate\nWhite wine\n\nI immediately went out and bought the ingredients. I tried over and over to recreate this sauce. Modulated the recipe countless times and used so many different proportions. Results tasted nothing like the Sun Sauce. Not even remotely similar. Found it odd but shrugged it off andf continued ordering it. For the record \u2013 they\u2019d charge roughly $15 for a QUART of this stuff, so it wasn\u2019t affordable.\n\nI became friendly with one of their delivery drivers. One day while he was dropping off my food, we struck up a conversation. He commented on how much extra Sun Sauce I always order. I told him how much I adore it. He then said: \u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a secret, but don\u2019t tell the owner I\u2019m telling you this \u2013 the Sun Sauce is nothing but mayo, mustard and soy sauce\u201d. I was\u00a0concerned.\u00a0Important detail here \u2013 I care about what\u2019s in it because I\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0consume any animal products. So if there was actual mayo in it, it would be a problem.\u00a0So\u00a0I then\u00a0had two different friends call the restaurant when I knew the owner would be there answering the phone.\n\nI told friend #1 to ask if the sauce is free of animal products (milk, eggs, honey, etc.) and what the ingredients were.\u00a0The ingredients he gave my friend were the same as the ones he gave me. And also said yes \u2013 the sauce is vegan.\n\nI told friend #2 to call and ask the same question, but preface it by explaining that the reason\u00a0he\u2019s\u00a0asking\u00a0was\u00a0because\u00a0he has\u00a0severe food allergies and could go into shock and/or die if they consume any animal products. Now my thinking here was this: if I\u2019m a restaurant owner and I want to lie about what\u2019s in my food, I can easily do so \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t risk a lawsuit when food allergies are\u00a0involved. A lie about one ingredient could land me in court. So restaurent owners are more likely to tell the truth (or at least\u00a0subtly point in the direction of it) when allergies are concerned.\u00a0The owner said it\u2019s free of animal products so he wouldn\u2019t have any issues with food allergies.\n\nAt this point I didn\u2019t know what to believe, but I was so obsessed with this sauce that I sided with the owner thinking\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0likelywouldn\u2019t bullshit this and be sued or put out of business.\n\nAll this was about 9 years ago. About 6 years\u00a0ago from today, the restaurant closed down\u00a0permanently. They had shut down temporarily at one point due to countless health code violations \u2013 including but not limited to roaches (in mass quanitities), mold, etc. I guess the renovation and\u00a0improvements\u00a0costed\u00a0them more\u00a0than what\u00a0they could afford. Wasn\u2019t long after this that they finally closed down.\n\nI\u2019ve missed this restaurant so much and recently stumbled upon the phone number of their old head chef in a Facebook comment thread. I texted the number and confirmed it was the chef. We chatted and then he informed me that he and the owner had rented out a commissary and were still making the same food for delivery only. I was thrilled. This was my favorite food on the planet and I was so excited that it was still accessible.\n\nChef gave me owner\u2019s number. Called owner. Caught up. Placed a delivery order. They were doing so well that all orders had to be placed 24 hours in advance. Got the food, thanked the owner for dropping it off, and enjoyed the same amazing food that I\u2019d missed so much. Since then I\u2019ve ordered delivery from him at least 10 times.\n\nSo I started thinking about the Sun Sauce again. So I texted the chef \u2013 not the owner \u2013 asking for the ingredients (not the recipe, just what\u2019s in it). Every message I\u2019d sent him up to this point (and there were many) he responded to promptly. This time he saw the message but never responded. I waited hours then sent one more. He saw it again, and said nothing. Minutes after, I\u00a0got this exact text from the owner:\n\n\u201c????? Hey there, the ingredients in the sauce are (proceeded to repeat the first list I mentioned in the beginning)???\u201d\n\nI have to assume that all the question marks imply \u2013 \u201cwhy are you asking this\u201d, or \u201cwhy do you want to know so badly\u201d\u2026\n\nI responded and thanked him for the info. Now what I find strange is that: (1) the chef answered so many of my questions except that one \u2013 and the feeling is that he passed the question to the owner as though the question made him nervous. (2) The owner seemed quite vexed by the question with all the excessive borderline-passive-aggressive question marks.\n\nAfter this, I got online and started digging. Stumbled upon the comment section for this restaurant on Yelp. Amidst close to a hundred comments was one from someone claiming to have waited tables there and concluded her comment with \u201cby the way, the Sun Sauce has a ton of mayo in it\u201d. It was too coincidental. A totally unrelated delivery driver from the same restaurant told me the same thing years ago.\n\nI know this probably sounds like sheer lunacy but this sauce is important to me. I\u2019ve never had anything like it. It even helps me eat healthy because it can make stuff like veggies, grains and other better options taste amazing. I have been using it literally every single day since I got back in touch with this guy.\n\nSo, my question is this \u2013 how can I find discover the truth? Can any of YOU guys help me with this? I contacted 3 different testing labs. One said they don\u2019t do food. The other 2 never got back to me. This is extremely important me so I\u2019ll take whatever help I can get. I considered asking the owner point-blank but this dude is old, grumpy and has a short fuse. If I inadvertently piss him off and the sauce is indeed vegan, I run the risk of being cut off from food I love so much that I literally have an emotional attachment to it. This is my dilemma.\n\nLooking forward to your responses!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/nh85ap/san_sauce_from_here_comes_the_sun_in_miami_florida/", "created_utc": 1621536331.0, "score": 68, "author": "MetallicFalcon", "num_comments": 71, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/nh85ap/san_sauce_from_here_comes_the_sun_in_miami_florida/", "html_title": ""}

Because both of us are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the\"Neiman-Marcus cookie.\" It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe, and the waitress said with a small frown, \"I\u2019m afraid not, but you can buy the recipe.\" Well, I asked how much, and she responded, \"Only two fifty-it\u2019s a great deal!\" I agreed to that, and told her to just add it to my tab.\n\nThirty days later, I received my VISA statement, and the Neiman-Marcus charge was $285.00! I looked again, and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, \"Cookie Recipe-$250.00\". That was outrageous!\nI called Neiman\u2019s Accounting Department and told them the waitress said it was \"two fifty\", which clearly does not mean \"two hundred and fifty dollars\" by any reasonable interpretation of the phrase. Neiman-Marcus refused to budge.\nThey would not refund my money because, according to them, \"What the waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the recipe. We absolutely will not refund your money at this point.\" I explained to the Accounting Department lady the criminal statutes which govern fraud in the state of Texas. I threatened to report them to the Better Business Bureau and the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office for engaging in fraud. I was basically told, \"Do what you want. Don\u2019t bother thinking of how you can get even, and don\u2019t bother trying to get any of your money back.\" I just said, Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I\u2019m going to have $250 worth of fun.\" I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail account has a $250 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus...for free.\nShe replied, \"I wish you wouldn\u2019t do this.\" I said, \"Well, perhaps you should have thought of that before you ripped me off!\" and slammed down the phone. So here it is!\n\nPlease, please, please pass it on to everyone you can possibly think of. I paid $250 for this, and I don\u2019t want Neiman-Marcus to EVER make another penny off of this recipe!

Most of the other recipes online were way off base or just lazy (Rotel and Velveeta? Good, but No.). So here's my take.\n\n\nSpinach Queso Dip\n\nA recreation of the classic appetizer from Ruby Tuesday.\n\n\nIngredients\n\n2 tbsp neutral oil\n\n\u215b tsp garlic powder\n\n\u215b tsp cumin\n\n\u215b tsp black pepper\n\n\u00bc tsp cayenne pepper\n\n\u00bc tsp MSG (optional)\n\n\u00bc tsp onion powder\n\n1 tbsp tomato paste\n\n2 tbsp canned green chilis or pickled jalapenos (minced)\n\n\u00bc cup frozen spinach (thawed)\n\n10.5 oz can cream of chicken soup (low sodium, strained to remove meat, if any)\n\n1/4 cup whole milk (or water)\n\n6 oz processed cheese product (Velveeta, etc., cubed)\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nWarm a small saucepan over medium heat, add oil. Add spices and saute until fragrant (30 seconds). \n\n\nAdd tomato paste and chilis, cook 1 minute stirring frequently - you want the oil to be a nice shade of orange here.\n\n\nAdd strained cream of chicken soup and milk, stir to combine thoroughly. When heated through, add spinach. Stir.\n\n\nFinally, add cheese product cubes and stir until completely homogeneous. \n\n\nServe immediately with fresh tortilla chips, or cool and store in the fridge for up to 1 week.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nTo reheat, microwave on high for 30 seconds, stir, and repeat until heated through (~160 degrees F).\n\n\nThe soup and cheese you use will vary wildly in sodium depending on brand/variety, so taste for salt and dilute or adjust as needed before serving. This recipe was tested using Campbell's Low Sodium Cream of Chicken and Velveeta, but YMMV.\n\n\nFeel free to add an extra tsp of tomato paste during the sauteing step for a bit more umami (my taste testers were split on whether this was needed, I think it's fine either way).\n\n\nEdit: after some input from /u/JinxedBelle [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/sbn69w/ruby_tuesdays_queso_dip/i83ke3g) I swapped out the cream of chicken for 4oz of chicken stock and the equivalent of chicken base (in this case, 1/2 tsp).

(This is more likely on an electric stove due to residual heat.) Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula, simmer until caramel registers 260\u00b0F (127\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer, about 7 minutes. \nImmediately pour into prepared pan, cover tightly with foil, and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.\n\n2.\nPeel caramel from parchment, transfer to a cutting board, and cut into 50 pieces (approximately 1/4 ounce or 7g each) with a sharp knife; don't worry about being too precise with their shape or size. If you like, use your fingers to mold the pieces into a more oval, Milk Dud\u2013like shape.\n\n3.\nFor the Chocolate Coating: Line a baking sheet with parchment. Temper chocolate according to one of the methods described here. Fold all caramel pieces into tempered chocolate. With a clean hand, scoop up pieces like handfuls of marbles, then slide each one over your index finger with your thumb into your other hand (think of how you'd dole out a handful of M&M's) and arrange on prepared baking sheet.

In a large saucepan, warm the olive oil and butter together over medium heat. \n\n2. When the butter has melted, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. \n\n3. Stir in the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, stirring frequently and stopping before the onion and garlic brown. \n\n4. Sprinkle the flour and continue cooking, stirring continuously, until the mixture turns a golden-blond color, 10 to 15 minutes. \n\n5. Then, whisking continuously, slowly pour in the stock until it is smoothly incorporated. \n\n6. When the mixture begins to simmer, stir in the cream. Let it return to the simmer. \n\n7. Remove from the heat, add the Parmesan, chicken base or bouillon cubes, lemon juice, and sugar, and stir until thoroughly blended. \n\n8. Add the sour cream, spinach, artichoke bottoms, Monterey Jack cheese and Tabasco sauce, and stir until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the cheese has melted. \n\n9.

{"title": "Cracker Barrel Maple Bacon Grilled Chicken/Old menu chili's grilled chicken", "selftext": "Hey guys. I'm looking to figure out how to cook boneless chicken breasts like many restaurants do. The most recent example is Maple Bacon Grilled Chicken from Cracker Barrel:\n https://new.crackerbarrel.com/menu/dinner/chicken-n-turkey/maple-bacon-grilled-chicken?productid=25652594\n\nChili's also use to serve a grilled chicken similar to it years ago before they started converting to texmex menus. \n\nThe chicken is usually very juicy with a clear-brown juice coming off it (love to dip shredded pieces in whatever the savory stuff is. Maybe worcestershire?). The bacon part is optional, as the chicken itself is what I looking too replicate. There's just something about the juice that comes off that I adore. Usually there chicken is covered in it. I'm not a huge fan of chicken bring thick pieces so I'm not looking for the typical \"juicy\" grilled chicken in the sense you cut it open to be very moist inside. \n\nCracker Barrel uses the same grilling method but gets this almost glaze like outside that's mostly savory, mildly sweet correct but adds hard cooked bacon on top of a little bit of cheddar drizzled with a light sauce that's definitely some kind of grey mustard base.\n\n\nI've got boneless chicken breasts thawing and was thinking of trying to make a budget home version. I'm just not sure what to do about getting as smoky/savory flavor glaze (I'm very much a basics/beginner cook). I was thinking of trying to combine maybe small amounts of maple syrup with worcestershire to the point of being runny, brine the chicken a while, cover in the glaze and throw them on a george foreman.\n\n\n\nTrust me, I know I don't know what I'm talking about so the above may sound terrible to those with trained taste buds, but I'd love any advice as I've gone years trying to replicate the chili's version from way back when only to be reminded recently by the cracker barrel chicken which I simply can't get enough of. \n\nAnyway, thanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/iskz06/cracker_barrel_maple_bacon_grilled_chickenold/", "created_utc": 1600090564.0, "score": 55, "author": "psyhcopig", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/iskz06/cracker_barrel_maple_bacon_grilled_chickenold/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Adjust oven rack to lower middle position, and preheat to 350\u00b0F. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine candi or toasted sugar with butter, baking soda, cinnamon, kinako, nutmeg, salt, cloves, cardamom, and anise. Cream on medium speed until fluffy, soft, and pale, about 10 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and paddle as needed if the sugar seems dense and compacted at the bottom of the bowl.\n\n2. While creaming on medium speed, slowly splash in the water a little at a time. Once it disappears into the fluffy butter/sugar mix, reduce speed to low and add the flour all at once. Continue mixing until the dough begins to gather around the paddle.\n\n3. Turn the dough onto a clean surface, and knead gently to form a ball. Pat into a rectangular shape, then dust with flour, above and below. Roll to a thickness of 3/16-inch, using a ruler for guidance. Slide an offset spatula beneath the dough to loosen, and brush away the excess flour.\n\n4. With a fluted pastry wheel, cut the dough into 3/4-inch strips, then cut crossways to form 2-inch rectangles. With the offset spatula, transfer the cutouts and scraps to a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving an inch between each piece to account for spread.\n\n5. Bake until cookies are golden brown, about 16 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through if needed to ensure even browning. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet; the cookies will not crisp until fully cool. Enjoy with coffee, and store leftovers in an airtight container up to 1 month at room temperature; the scraps can be ground to use for crumbs and frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/6fnno5/biscoff_speculoos_cookies_recipe_by_stella_parks/", "created_utc": 1496773215.0, "score": 49, "author": "blamsberg", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/6fnno5/biscoff_speculoos_cookies_recipe_by_stella_parks/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Set aside.\n\nUsing a hand or stand mixer (fitted with a paddle attachment) cream together the butter and sugar, along with the powdered milk, nutmeg, salt and baking soda, on medium speed. Not until light and fluffy, but only until well combined. About a minute. Scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula and cream a minute more.\n\nSet the mixer to low. Drizzle in the vanilla. With the mixer still running, add half the flour and mix until just incorporated. Then add half the egg whites. Repeat with the remaining flour and egg whites. Mix until homogenous, then shut off the mixer.\n\nUse a rubber spatula to scrape the cookie dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap. Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight, before rolling.\n\n2.\nCut and bake the cookies:\n\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0 and have 2 parchment lined sheet pans standing by.\n\nOn a well floured surface, roll the cookies to just a little over 1/4\" thickness (3/8\" if you like to be precise). Run a metal spatula between the dough and the rolling surface, to ensure the dough isn't sticking in any places. Cut the dough with your desired cutters and transfer the cut-outs to the cookie sheet. They won't spread significantly in the oven, so they can be placed fairly close together.\n\nIf you like, dock the cookies twice with the tip of a clicky pen (clicked to the retracted position) to mimic the large, deep dock marks on the originals.\n\nYou can gather, knead and re-roll the scraps three times; the dough is very forgiving.\n\nBake the cookies for approximately 12 minutes, or until quite firm to the touch and just beginning to brown. Cool thoroughly.

{"title": "Santiago's Green Chile (my version)", "selftext": "I moved out of Colorado and had to resort to making this iconic sauce on my own. I changed the recipe a bit- I personally don't use jalapenos like their ingredient list calls for, and mine is gluten free because I only use cornstarch to thicken, they use a combo of cornstarch and flour. PLEASE let me know if you try it what you think. I only used their ingredient list as a guide, this is completely my creation. Thanks... Enjoy! \n\n\n3 pork shoulder steaks, cut into 1cm pieces \n\n3x by volume chopped green chilies (so 1c pork to 3c gc but can adjust based on spice level preference) (I used Musso's Pueblo chilies)\n\n1 can crushed or diced tomatoes, drained\n\nCorn starch (can use flour if needed)\n\nWater\n\nSalt\n\nGarlic powder\n\n-Trim fat from the pork shoulder steaks. In a nonstick (I used enameled dutch oven) with a lid, on medium heat, start cooking the fat to render lard. \n\n-once enough lard to cook with is rendered, scoop out pieces. Raise temp to med-hi and sear pork pieces. Stir to cook evenly\n\n-After decent sear, coat in 2-3Tbsp cornstarch. You can use more if you want it extra thick, I ended up using an immersion blender to get a more saucy texture but if you want a more textured sauce just use an extra lil bit of cornstarch. You can always add later too, I'll leave a note on when. \n\n-stir so cornstarch evenly coats the meat and creates a roux. Add tomatoes, garlic powder to taste (I used 3Tbsp) and 1Tbsp salt. Stir well then add about 4-6c water. I used 6c but you can start with 4 and see if you want more in there. Stir well and bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer, stirring occasionally. After 15-20min pull a little bit into a small dish to taste test. Add garlic or salt as needed. \n\n-here is where you decide if you're happy with it. If you want it to be textured but thicker, simmer a little longer and if it still isn't thick enough for your preference, ladle out some broth and whisk in cornstarch. Once there are no clumps you can stir it into the main pot. If you think it's perfect but want less texture, use an immersion blender (if you have one or CAREFULLY use a regular blender to puree up a portion of the sauce. Be really careful if you do it that way though) admittedly I accidentally pureed up some pork when I used my stick blender but it didn't negatively affect flavor. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/1fpm1ut/santiagos_green_chile_my_version/", "created_utc": 1727318027.0, "score": 4, "author": "Ms_Moto", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/1fpm1ut/santiagos_green_chile_my_version/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Among its most popular offerings is the signature Bibibop chicken bowl\u2014a delightful combination of marinated chicken, crisp vegetables, hearty grains, and mouthwatering sauces.\n\nThe appeal of Bibibop lies in its ability to cater to a wide range of tastes and dietary preferences, with options for gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan diets. However, the real star of the show is the Bibibop chicken, which is tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. For those who crave this savory dish but want to enjoy it in the comfort of their own home, a copycat recipe is the perfect solution.\n\n# Recreating Bibibop Copycat Chicken Recipe\n\nRecreating the Bibibop chicken bowl at home not only allows you to control the quality and freshness of the ingredients but also gives you the freedom to customize the bowl to your liking. In this comprehensive guide, we\u2019ll walk you through a step-by-step process to make the perfect Bibibop chicken, complete with tips for achieving that signature flavor, and ideas for building the ultimate Bibibop-style bowl. Plus, we\u2019ll discuss how making this dish at home is a healthy, cost-effective, and delicious alternative to dining out.\n\n# The Essential Ingredients for Bibibop Copycat Chicken Recipe\n\nTo capture the authentic taste of Bibibop\u00a0[chicken](https://sadierecipes.com/chef-sadies-ultimate-chicken-alfredo-stuffed-shells-recipe/), it\u2019s important to use the right ingredients. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\n**Chicken Marinade:**\n\n* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or breasts, if preferred)\n* 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari (for a gluten-free option)\n* 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon ginger, minced or grated\n* 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red chili paste) or sriracha for a milder spice\n* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional, for added texture)\n\n**Bibibop Bowl:**\n\n* 2 cups cooked rice (white, brown, or cauliflower rice for a low-carb option)\n* 1 cup shredded carrots\n* 1 cup sliced cucumbers\n* 1 cup spinach, lightly saut\u00e9ed or steamed\n* 1/2 cup kimchi (store-bought or homemade)\n* 1/2 cup pickled radishes or other pickled vegetables\n* 1 avocado, sliced\n* 1/4 cup chopped green onions\n* 2 tablespoons sesame seeds\n* Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish\n\n**Signature Bibibop Sauce:**\n\n* 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari\n* 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon honey or agave syrup\n* 1 clove garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon gochujang or sriracha\n* 1/2 teaspoon ginger, minced\n* 1 tablespoon water (optional, to thin the sauce if needed)\n\n# Step-by-Step Guide to Making Bibibop Copycat Chicken Recipe\n\n**1. Prepare the Marinade**\n\n* In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the soy sauce (or tamari), sesame oil, rice vinegar, honey, minced garlic, ginger, gochujang (or sriracha), black pepper, and sesame seeds. Ensure the ingredients are well combined to create a rich and flavorful marinade.\n* Add the chicken thighs to the marinade, making sure each piece is fully coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, but preferably 2-4 hours for maximum flavor absorption.\n\n**2. Cook the Chicken**\n\n* After marinating, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes.\n* Preheat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the pan with a little sesame oil to prevent sticking and enhance the flavor.\n* Once the pan is hot, add the marinated chicken thighs in a single layer, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is fully cooked and has a nice caramelized exterior.\n* For an extra smoky flavor, consider grilling the\u00a0[chicken](https://sadierecipes.com/chef-sadies-ultimate-chicken-alfredo-stuffed-shells-recipe/)\u00a0on an outdoor grill. The slightly charred edges will add depth to the dish.\n* Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into thin strips or bite-sized pieces.\n\n**3. Prepare the Rice and Vegetables**\n\n* While the chicken is marinating, cook your rice according to the package instructions. For a classic Bibibop bowl, you can use white rice, brown rice, or even cauliflower rice for a low-carb option.\n* Prepare the vegetables: shred the carrots, slice the cucumbers, and lightly saut\u00e9 or steam the spinach. Arrange the vegetables in separate bowls to make assembling the Bibibop bowls easier.\n* If you\u2019re using kimchi or pickled vegetables, you can buy them from a store or prepare them at home. Pickled radishes add a tangy crunch that complements the savory chicken.\n\n**4. Make the Signature Bibibop Sauce**\n\n* In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce (or tamari), sesame oil, rice vinegar, honey, minced garlic, gochujang (or sriracha), and ginger. Adjust the sweetness or spiciness according to your taste. Add a little water if you prefer a thinner consistency.\n* This sauce will serve as a drizzle for the entire bowl, tying all the flavors together.\n\n# Customizing Your Bibibop Copycat Chicken Recipe Bowl\n\nOne of the joys of a Bibibop-style bowl is its versatility. You can mix and match ingredients based on your preferences or what you have on hand. Here are some ideas for customizing your bowl:\n\n**1. Swap the Protein:**\n\n* While chicken is the classic choice, you can easily substitute it with beef, pork, tofu, or tempeh for a different flavor profile. For vegetarians, marinated tofu or tempeh works beautifully in this dish.\n\n**2. Choose Your Grains:**\n\n* White or brown rice is traditional, but quinoa, farro, or cauliflower rice are great alternatives. If you\u2019re gluten-free, stick with rice or cauliflower rice.\n\n**3. Mix Up the Vegetables:**\n\n* The beauty of Bibibop bowls lies in their colorful array of vegetables. Try adding roasted sweet potatoes, bell peppers, snap peas, or edamame for extra nutrition and variety.\n\n**4. Play with the Sauces:**\n\n* While the signature Bibibop sauce is delicious, don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with other sauces like spicy mayo, teriyaki, or even a peanut sauce for a nutty twist[.](https://www.bibibop.com/)\n\n**5. Add Crunch and Texture:**\n\n* Top your bowl with toasted sesame seeds, chopped nuts, crispy fried onions, or seaweed flakes for added texture and flavor.\n\n# How to Prepare a Complete Bibibop Copycat Chicken Recipe-Style Bowl at Home\n\nCreating a Bibibop-style bowl at home is more than just preparing the chicken; it\u2019s about building a balanced and flavorful meal. Here\u2019s how to assemble the perfect bowl:\n\n**1. Start with a Base:**\n\n* Choose your base of rice, grains, or greens. Spread it evenly across the bottom of your bowl.\n\n**2. Add the Protein:**\n\n* Place the sliced Bibibop chicken on top of the base. The protein is the heart of the bowl, so make sure it\u2019s front and center.\n\n**3. Layer the Vegetables:**\n\n* Surround the chicken with a variety of vegetables. The contrasting colors and textures make the bowl visually appealing and nutritious.\n\n**4. Include Fermented Sides:**\n\n* Add a spoonful of kimchi or pickled vegetables for a tangy, probiotic-rich component that enhances the overall flavor.\n\n**5. Drizzle with Sauce:**\n\n* Generously drizzle the signature Bibibop sauce over the entire bowl, making sure every bite is infused with flavor.\n\n**6. Garnish and Serve:**\n\n* Finish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds, chopped green onions, and fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley. Serve immediately while the chicken is still warm.\n\n**Optional Sides:**\n\n* **Kimchi**: A staple in Korean cuisine, kimchi adds a spicy, tangy crunch to your bowl. You can buy it from the store or make your own at home.\n* **Pickled Vegetables**: Quick-pickled cucumbers, radishes, or carrots are easy to prepare and add a refreshing contrast to the savory chicken.\n* **Gluten-Free Options**: If you\u2019re avoiding gluten, make sure to use tamari instead of soy sauce and opt for gluten-free grains like rice or quinoa.\n\n# Why Making Bibibop Copycat Chicken Recipe at Home is a Healthy ?\n\n**1. Control Over Ingredients:**\n\n* When you make Bibibop at home, you have complete control over the quality of the ingredients. You can choose organic vegetables, free-range chicken, and low-sodium sauces, ensuring a healthier meal.\n\n**2. Customize to Your Dietary Needs:**\n\n* Whether you\u2019re gluten-free, dairy-free, or vegan, making Bibibop at home allows you to tailor the meal to your specific dietary needs. You can easily swap out ingredients to suit your preferences.\n\n**3. Cost-Effective:**\n\n* Dining out can be expensive, especially at popular fast-casual restaurants like Bibibop. By making your own Bibibop bowls at home, you can save money while still enjoying a delicious and satisfying meal.\n\n**4. Freshness and Flavor:**\n\n* There\u2019s nothing quite like the taste of freshly prepared food. By cooking at home, you can enjoy the freshest ingredients, perfectly cooked chicken, and a bowl bursting with flavor.\n\n**5.

Line baking trays with parchment paper.  \nIn a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, caster sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.  \nBeat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.  \nSift the flour and salt into the bowl and fold it into the mixture until well combined. Be careful not to overmix at this stage.  \nStir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.  \nUsing a tablespoon or cookie scoop, scoop out portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place them onto the prepared baking trays, leaving some space between each cookie for spreading.  \nBake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown around the edges but still slightly soft in the middle.  \nOnce baked, remove the trays from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the trays for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.  \nRepeat the baking process with any remaining cookie dough until it has all been used.  \nOnce cooled, serve and enjoy these delicious homemade Millie's-style cookies with a glass of cold milk!  \nThese cookies are best enjoyed fresh on the day of baking but can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3-4 days. You can also freeze the cookie dough balls and bake them straight from frozen, just add a few extra minutes to the baking time.  \n\u2192 Find more sweet recipes on [CookeryHQ.com](https://www.CookeryHQ.com)\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/1cntg3r/milliesstyle_classic_chocolate_chip_cookies/", "created_utc": 1715248578.0, "score": 10, "author": "CookeryHQ", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/1cntg3r/milliesstyle_classic_chocolate_chip_cookies/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Moe's Black Cherry Chipotle Salsa, Attempt I", "selftext": "Remember me? I posted asking for [a clone of Moe's Black Cherry Chipotle Salsa](https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/14gb0z1/request_moes_black_cherry_chipotle_salsa/)?\n\nSo... I decided to try doing it myself. As noted, we already had the ingredients. And thankfully, there are already clone recipes for Moe's Pico de Gallo, which is one of the ingredients. [I used this recipe](https://secretcopycatrestaurantrecipes.com/moes-southwest-grill-pico-de-gallo-recipe/), though cut in half, to get it all started. For the southwest seasoning, I decided to put together my own following [this recipe](https://www.simplyscratch.com/homemade-southwest-seasoning/). Finally, with some chipotles in adobo, pickled jalapeno, lime, and, of course... cherries*... this is my first attempt.\n\nIt's certainly not the final form, but it's much closer than I expected. For me it made somewhere around 4.5 to 5 cups. My apologies that that isn't specific, especially because... this is all in grams. Since this isn't its final form, I haven't worked out volume measurements, yet.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-309g tomato, diced, with seeds and such removed\n\n-50g onion, diced\n\n-6g cilantro, chopped\n\n-17g fresh jalapeno, minced\n\n-2g salt\n\n-9g lime juice\n\n-2.3g southwest seasoning\n\n-664g cherries, pits removed\n\n-116g chipotle in adobo\n\n-16g pickled jalapenos\n\n-2g smoked paprika\n\n-More salt, to taste\n\nSo you're first gonna make the pico de gallo by combining the tomatoes, onion, fresh jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, southwest seasoning, and 2g of salt in a bowl and tossing to combine. Optionally, if you decided to start this late and you're tired, you could totally let this sit covered in the fridge overnight. I did.\n\nThen, when you're ready, put the pico in a blender with the cherries, chipotles, pickled jalapenos, and paprika. Blend up until it reaches a point where it's broken down but still chunky. This is not the final texture, but now you have room for tasting and seasoning without blending too far into the \"smooth\" territory.\n\nGive it a taste and see what you think. More salt? More chipotle? More of anything else?\n\nIn terms of final blended texture, you want something that does *trend* towards smooth, but still has some texture to it. You don't want big chunks, but you don't want a super smooth jelly, either.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here's where I made what I think is my biggest mistake...\n\nI was hunting for that smokiness that's in Moe's salsa. I first chased it with chipotles in adobo, which resulted in a salsa that, I'm sad to say, is a bit too spicy for me (side note: I am very much a wimp when it comes to spice, unfortunately, and fixing that is much easier said than done, at least for me). This is also where the little bit of smoked paprika comes in.\n\nOf course, it turns out that what I was missing wasn't smoke, but *salt*. I only used 4g across the whole recipe. Next time, I'm gonna cut back on the chipotle quite a bit and just add more salt. I really should have known that, but I've become rather aware of the amount of salt I've been eating, especially with high blood pressure running in my family. I'd *like* to cut back, but the way salt (and fat... let's be honest) enhances flavor is... well... it's hard to resist. I *might* have an addiction, TBH...\n\nAnyways...\n\nHow did I manage to get the two confused, you ask?\n\nI was making this at 12am, my mouth was not happy with the ever-increasing amount of chipotle peppers being added, and I was also not *entirely* sober...\n\nFinally, I'm also rather convinced that they add at least a little extra sugar. But not sucrose... fructose. I say that because the amount of cherries I used was basically an entire bag from the store, but it still isn't *quite* as sweet as Moe's. It's close, for sure, but there's definitely something else in Moe's salsa, and like I said... I'm pretty sure it's added fructose, because the sweetness is still a fruity sweetness rather than your basic sucrose sweetness. I'd have to get some and try it, though.\n\nIf anyone else wants to take a shot at this, or at least offer some advice, I would genuinely love that. I definitely think I overdid the chipotle peppers, but you might like that! And even though it's not part of Moe's salsa (as far as I know), I want to keep the smoked paprika. I *might* increase it next time, in fact... not sure, yet.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JltK2Rx\n\nThat picture makes it look rather red, but it is, in fact, purple. Not quite as dark as Moe's because... another disclosure... *I failed at finding black cherries, but I did find sweet cherries which were about as close in color as I could find.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/comments/14tudkp/moes_black_cherry_chipotle_salsa_attempt_i/", "created_utc": 1688792621.0, "score": 2, "author": "NateHevens", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/MimicRecipes/comments/14tudkp/moes_black_cherry_chipotle_salsa_attempt_i/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Didn't hurt that we had fresh pasta from Osteria La Buca, bread from Tartine, beautiful cast iron from Butter Pat industries, and a lovely selection of drinks from The Bruery and Hanson's of Sonoma to wash it all down.

You can purchase from a grocery store as \u201cstrained tomatoes\u201d   \nSet up a meat grinder attachment for a Kitchen Aid Mixer, if you don\u2019t have one you can ask your local butcher to grind your meats for you. Begin ragu by grinding chuck into a bowl, set aside. Grind remaining meats: pancetta and prosciutto into another bowl, set aside. Grind all the vegetables in the meat grinder into a bowl. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t have a grinder, pass them through a food processor, pulsing until fine. Heat a la Heat a large, heavy-bottom saucepot (about 5-quart Dutch oven) over medium-high heat. Melt pork fat, adding prosciutto and pancetta, cooking until rendered, about 4 minutes. Add ground veggies and stir. Cook the vegetables, stirring frequently until a sweet aroma forms, around 15 minutes. Add the ground beef, season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Mix the meat with the vegetables with a wooden spoon. Cook for 4-6 minutes stirring occasionally, once you see the juices start to run, add red wine and stir to incorporate. Once you see a whisper of steam, add the tomato passata and stir to incorporate. Reduce heat to low and gently. Add the stock and reduce heat to low. Gently simmer sauce, a gentle bubble every minute. Taste. At this point it should taste slightly under seasoned. As it reduces the flavors will intensify. Cook for 3-5 hours stirring occasionally every 15 minutes or so, until the beef and pork are tender and flavors are concentrated. Taste sauce again, re-season and remove from heat.
