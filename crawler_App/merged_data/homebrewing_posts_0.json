If you think homebrewing is a clever way to hide your excessive drinking, you\u2019re going to regret it one day. \n\nPiles of equipment, books, expert knowledge, stacks of grain, awesome hops in the freezer, a mini chem lab, etc. etc.. I got really great at brewing beer and was all in on the hobby but now I\u2019m looking at all this stuff having stopped brewing a few months back, dumped all my awesome aging sour beer a couple months ago and stopped drinking entirely a month ago and I miss it all terribly but I\u2019d rather have a marriage and healthy relationships and not be worried about my job performance and the liver enzymes results every year at my physical. \n\nFrom someone who learned the hard way\u2026 take a couple days off every week and try to keep it under 4 drinks most days while you still can (and, yes, a pint 7.5% IPA counts as 2 drinks).  You can\u2019t really turn back once you go down the addiction road too far. And, believe me I tried desperately for far too long to go back to moderate drinking. You can read all the stories about how that goes on /r/stopdrinking (which is a great place if you need help).\n\nI still can\u2019t quite bring myself to sell all the stuff but maybe someday soon. If anyone has cool ideas on repurposing homebrew equipment (I\u2019m making salami now, for example) and supplies and/or rehoming it where it\u2019ll get used well, I\u2019m all ears.

{"title": "Have been having issues with sour beer, found the source of the problem yesterday", "selftext": "Hello r/Homebrewing,\n\nMy buddy and I have been brewing for awhile now. We started making extract kits a couple years ago, then switched to all-grain batches about 8 months ago. We bought a full gravity brew system and have been brewing pretty much every other week since then.\n\nA couple weeks ago we had to dump a batch of an IPA we brewed because it came out sour. We had gotten a little careless and didn't taste the beer at every stage that we could. We assumed we had picked up an infection somewhere, so we washed and sanitized all of our equipment and moved on.\n\nThe next batch was a pretty simple Pale Ale. We have a base recipe that we tweak a little bit each time we brew. It's a great way to sample different hop varieties, but it's a beer that we have brewed a dozens of times without an issue. We taste this batch at every stage and it's fine. We let it condition for a couple weeks in the bottle. Tasting day comes and we are shocked to find that the beer comes out sour and flat. What the hell? We sanitize all of the equipment again, and buy a new siphon and replace our plastic primary fermenters just in case.\n\nOur next batch was 10 gallons of a porter recipe we had not done before. Now, you are probably wondering why you would do a 10 gallon batch of a style of beer you had never worked with before, when you obviously have a major issue with your brewing process. You would be correct in thinking that.\n\nOur process is on point for this brew. We document every step this beer takes. We split the 10 gallons into two brand new primary fermenters. We use our brand new siphon to move those two batches into two meticulously cleaned and sanitized secondary fermenters. We sample the beer at every stage and find no issues with it. \n\nBottling day comes yesterday and we are both optimistic that we have eliminated any issues. We sample it before siphoning it into our bottling bucket and priming sugar mixture, no issues at all. We proceed to fill 130 bottles of non-sour porter. Just to be safe, we sample the last half-bottle that isn't going to get capped. It's sour. Brutally sour.\n\nMy buddy and I are dumbfounded at this point. I would like to think that we are both fairly intelligent people, but we just can't figure out what went wrong here. We've checked everything. \n\nAs I sit there, wondering how much I will be able to get from selling all this homebrewing equipment, I notice the bag of priming sugar. It's the only thing we haven't checked. I taste a small sample of it and find that it is carries the overwhelming taste of sour patch kids. Or sour skittles. Or the crushing reality that our process was not the issue and that we had been sold a three pound bag citric acid instead of priming sugar.\n\nI find this situation equal parts infuriating and hilarious. Always taste-test your ingredients I guess. \n\nTl;dr: Had 20 gallons of beer turn out flat & sour. Went crazy cleaning, sanitizing, and replacing equipment wherever possible. Turns out we had been trying unsuccessfully to make Sour Patch Kids Ale for the past two months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/3vsspr/have_been_having_issues_with_sour_beer_found_the/", "created_utc": 1449502385.0, "score": 694, "author": "village_boozehound", "num_comments": 122, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/3vsspr/have_been_having_issues_with_sour_beer_found_the/", "html_title": ""}

Paste spoke with the co-owner of UNION craft brewing Jon Zerivitz to get the perspective of a brewery owner on the two bills, and his comment was:\n\n>\u201cIt makes me feel sad, to feel disillusioned, to question our choice to start up here in the state at all,\u201d Zerivitz said to Paste.\n\n**EDIT 2: Contact info http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/06hse/html/hsedist.html**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/7xjpg4/the_maryland_legislature_is_set_to_debate_two/", "created_utc": 1518629586.0, "score": 676, "author": "hoky315", "num_comments": 53, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/7xjpg4/the_maryland_legislature_is_set_to_debate_two/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "New Belgium AMA \u2014 ask away!", "selftext": "Hey everyone, Andy Mitchell (NBB brewhouse operator, homebrewer and overall pleasant guy) will be joining me to answer all your homebrewing-related questions at 2:30 p.m. MST. Got questions? Drop 'em in this thread and we'll answer them this afternoon. And thanks to /u/Masowb8 for setting this up!\n\nLet's talk beer!\n\nEdit: Hey everyone, my name is Andy Mitchell.  I'm going to be sharing this account with Nic to answer questions. I'm a brewer here at New Belgium as well as a homebrewer.  I started homebrewing 3.5 years ago and shortly after began volutneering at Funkwerks, a small berwery here in Fort Collins.  I was hired there after a few months and worked there for a year and half.  I'm not in the brewhouse at New Belgium and have been here for almost a year.  I'm super excited that there are already so many questions and I'll try to answer them all.  Nic will be helping me with some of the non-brewing specific questions.  If there's something I'm unsure of I'll try to answer it soon...probably early next week since I'll be in Denver for Craft Brewers Conference the next few days.  Let's get started...AMA!\n\nEdit 2: There's been a few questions about a recipe for Fat Tire.  I can't give out too many details, but here's what I can give you.  We do list our ingredients on our website so if you have recipe questions check there first.  If you have more questions send and email to the brewery (nbb@newbelgium.com) and I will answer them.\n\nHere's what we use\n\nMalt:\nPale\nMunich\nVictory\nC80\nCarapils\n(in order from most to least)\n\nFor Hops we use:\nTarget (bittering)\nUS Goldings (aroma)\nWillamette (aroma)\n\nWe use a neutral ale yeast\n\n\nEdit 3: Thanks for all the questions everyone! I need to hit the road, but Andy's gonna stick around for a while longer and continue to answer questions. I'll jump back in later tonight and tomorrow. Cheers! \u2014 Nic\n\nEdit 4: There have been a lot of questions about getting into the brewing industry here what you should know.  Commercial brewing is hard work.  There's a lot of manual labor, there's a lot of cleaning, it can be very repetitive, and when things go wrong it can be very chaotic.  You also won't get rich making beer, but it can be very fun and it's very humbling and gratifying to have someone order your beer when you're sitting next to them at a bar and theyhave no idea who you are.\n\nIf that sounds fun to you your best shot at getting into the industry is to get a brewing education and / or volunteer at a small brewery.  You probably won't start with brewing.  There's a good chance you'll be cleaning kegs, packaging, and cleaning tanks.\n\nBesides potentially going to school; get involved in your local beer communitee.  Join a homebrew club, share your beer with breweries, talk to people and make connections.  If you have the skills and the passion you'll get there, but it takes a lot of hard work.\n\nFinal Edit:  I had a lot of fun today, thanks for all of the awesome questions! I'll check in again over the next couple days and see if there's anymore questions or anything I missed.

{"title": "A guide to making horrible mountain dew prison wine at home", "selftext": "Ever since I started homebrewing, I have been drawn by curiosity to ferment unusual beverages. I have always wondered what different types of commonly available juices and sugars might become a delectable alcoholic beverage by just adding a little bit of yeast. This line of intrigue eventually culminated in a persona quest to ferment soft drinks like pepsi, coke, mountain dew, etc., but the problem I always ran into was the preservatives they contain like sodium benzoate, which are added for the specific purpose of killing microbes like yeast. Alas, it seemed my dream of wine made from mountain dew was not meant to be!\n\nBut just recently I had a breakthrough when I read on wikipedia that the anti-microbial\u00a0property of sodium benzoate (i.e. benzoic acid) is PH dependent, \"The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the\u00a0intracellular pH\u00a0falls to 5 or lower, the\u00a0anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase decreases sharply,[20]\u00a0which inhibits the growth and survival of microorganisms that cause food spoilage.\" For reference, the average PH of a carbonated sugary soft drink is about 3.\n\nNow I'm not a wine maker\u00a0and I'm not very much of a beer brewer, so I haven't messed much with PH in my \"normal\" home brew process, but I discovered that a small addition of sodium bicarbonate was enough to neutralize my sugary soft drink and raise the PH above 5-- and like magic, wine yeast began to thrive in spite of the preservatives. Success! Those of you who are wine makers and are more familiar with the nuances of PH balance are probably cringing at the crudeness of this suggestion, but it seems that just a little baking soda seems to do the trick for purposes of making prison wine fermentation viable.\n\nI've also found that a single 2 liter of soda plus one 12 oz frozen juice concentrate commonly found in the grocery store frozen isle, after boiling for 15-20 minutes, is just the right volume of water and sugar to make 2 liters of 10-12% ABV \"wine\". This means you can re-use the container it came in for fermentation, which is incredibly convenient-- there's no measuring or equipment required at all. \n\nThe beauty is the simplicity. Here's how it works: pick any 2 liter soda and any 12 oz frozen juice concentrate, throw em\u00a0in a pot and boil on the stove for about 15 minutes, pop in a spoonful of baking soda, cool, add wine yeast, and then just put it right back into the 2 liter to ferment (don't fully close the lid). The materials cost about $5 and result in 2.5 bottles of \"wine\", and while it's not good by any means, it's just fun to try different flavor combinations. Mountain dew and apple juice? Sure. Pepsi and grapefruit juice? Why not! Will they be disgusting? Almost certainly, but there's a whole world of combinations out there-- probably at least one of them is delicious. My favorite so far is Dr. Pepper and grape juice concentrate, but I'm still experimenting with different flavors....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/gvic6g/a_guide_to_making_horrible_mountain_dew_prison/", "created_utc": 1591139972.0, "score": 560, "author": "forenob", "num_comments": 131, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/gvic6g/a_guide_to_making_horrible_mountain_dew_prison/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Random Act of Homebrewing Kindness", "selftext": "I just have to share this story because I was moved almost to tears, literally. \n\nI've been brewing a lot of bigger batches lately, so I'm trying to bolster my bottle collection. I posted on Craigslist as a Hail Mary, hoping someone would come across it and save me a few out of their recycling. \n\nLast night I got a message -- a local fella said he had ***seven cases*** of empties in the back of his truck, that were mine if I could meet him. He was a few neighborhoods away and I was in the middle of making dinner so I asked if we could meet tomorrow; he said he would drop them off at my house in 30 minutes. When he got here, we started unloading the bottles, and he asked if I was interested in anything else in the bed of his truck: a nice 8-gallon brew kettle, a Monster Mill, a mash tun made out of a keg, a wort chiller, and some paddles/etc. \"Well, yeah, I could use all of those things...\" I said. My rig is pretty spartan and I've been in the market for a grain mill in particular, but just haven't been able to budget for it yet. \"But, I am pretty short on cash today, so I'm afraid I can't make you an offer for any of it.\" \n\n\"Today's your lucky day,\" the man said. \n\nApparently his brother, who went gung-ho into homebrewing, recently passed away. This generous stranger was taking care of his brother's possessions and didn't have any family members who were into brewing. Mainly, he wanted to make sure the gear would go to a good home where it would be used. He gave it all to me. ***For free***. \n\nI was so awe-struck by this stranger's generosity. He went out of his way to deliver maybe $1000 worth of nice homebrewing equipment right to my door, and asked nothing in return. My fiance was helping me unloading the bottles and said that she could see tears in my eyes welling up when I realized what he was offering. Although I didn't have cash to offer, I gave him a few extra bottles of brew I had made -- plus a Modelo Negra, \"in case the ones I made aren't any good\" -- and some fresh garlic that we just dug up from our garden. \n\nI just can't believe how generous and kind this guy was. I usually only cry when I watch movies about baseball (weird, I know) but I'm still misting up a little bit as I type this. The man fist-bumped me (slightly more COVID-safe than a handshake?) and offered me his card. I'm glad I have his work address and know what he drives, because I intend to leave him a nice batch of Christmas homebrew to thank him properly. Anyway, I just wanted to share the news that random acts of kindness are alive and well out there -- and say if you ever want to buy or sell property in Alaska, give Colin Roth at REMAX a shout!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/jg3a0g/random_act_of_homebrewing_kindness/", "created_utc": 1603385072.0, "score": 541, "author": "MiciousVammal", "num_comments": 44, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/jg3a0g/random_act_of_homebrewing_kindness/", "html_title": ""}

I fermented at 65F and let it sit on the yeast for about 3 weeks. I then cold crashed and transferred it to a keg and then back sweetened it with a thawed can of Frozen Apple Juice Concentrate. \n\n\nThat is all there was to it and it tasted almost identical to the rather expensive local cider batches that I have made previously. At only $25 for 5gallons of delicious hard cider, I don't think I will be going back to the fancy local cider mill any more. Too much of the flavor is stripped out of the good stuff when it ferments. When I make the batch again I will likely go for 1.5 cans of the frozen apple juice concentrate to give it a touch more sweetness and body. \n\n\nAlso, to transform this into an excellent cran-apple cider, add 1-2 cans of frozen cranberry cocktail concentrate. Start with 1 and taste and increase by 1/4 can at a time until you get your desired flavor. It yields an amazing red color has a great tartness and flavor from the cranberry. \n\n\nI won Gold and Best of Show for my plain cider and Silver for my cranberry cider.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/bz0pfx/i_decided_to_brew_the_cheapest_hard_cider_i_could/", "created_utc": 1560187959.0, "score": 519, "author": "AmarokTactical", "num_comments": 149, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/bz0pfx/i_decided_to_brew_the_cheapest_hard_cider_i_could/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The Big Cider Making Post", "selftext": "Hello everyone. \n\nI have seen a lot of \u201cHow can I make Cider\u201d or \u201cHow to xyz my cider\u201d or \u201cmy cider tastes like butthole\u201d posts lately and I've been planning on doing one big post as a frame of reference and to try to finally get some concise answers or at least vague advice for people who make cider or are planning to. \n\n\nThe term \"cider\" is very ambiguous. I see arguments sparking here often of what a \u201ccider\u201d actually is. However, that argument is irrelevant to the process of making something that is actually good to drink.  \n\n\nI will attempt to divide this into more simple and concise categories and discuss techniques and strategies for each. First I will make notes on things that are important for any recipe.\n\nThese notes are made on research, but mostly, personal experience. I'm sorry for the wordiness, **I will try to highlight the most important points for those of you (i.e. everyone) skimming**.  \n\n\nPlease give me a few minutes to double-check formatting, this has been a long process.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\nFirstly:\n\nThere are some things that go for every type of cider you can make:\n\n1) **Do not boil your ingredients**. Do don't unless some particular ingredient that is not fruit requires boiling for extraction. If you boil your juice/fruit/must you will get something that tastes so bad your garbage disposal will spit it back up. \n\n2) There are three things that are absolutely and completely an ingredient in every recipe.  **Good Juice, good yeast and patience.** Honestly, if you can use fresh-pressed apple juice from good apples, do. It will completely make the difference between a typical cider and an incredible drink. However, I make great cider all of the time without spending out the ass on fresh-apple juice. \n\n-If you are using cheap mott's type juice, try to put at least part of your juice as fresh pressed or at least use some pasteurized fresh fruit. It will make a huge difference. And try to avoid the 100% Vitamin C ones, but completely avoid  with potassium sorbate. \n\n3) In these recipes, **I highly (9/10 times) recommend adding actual fruit matter to your ciders. Especially when using particularly aggressive yeasts.** It will not only improve the \"fresh-cider\" type flavor, but it's good for yeast food.  Fresh is always best, but frozen works great too. Freezing ruptures the cell walls and helps make it easier for more sugars to be processed by the yeast. What about bacteria? See pasteurization method below. \n\n- - - - - - - -\nAnother note on fruit additions\n\n**Primary**\n\n**If you add a few pounds of fruit in primary, you're going to start with a beautiful colored concoction.  It's going to ferment out completely and you won't be able to tell.** I've seen cider start red with raspberries and completely lose all the color in two weeks. \n\nHowever, **it's good for your yeast. It also adds character to the nose and adds a body to build your secondary fruit addition upon**.\n\n I always add fruit at both primary in secondary (if I add fruit).\n\n**Secondary**\n\n**If you want to maintain the color and flavor of your chosen fruit, add it at secondary**. Use the mash method shown below and add it when you're within a few points of your targeted final gravity. \n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPasteurization:\n\nThere are a few methods of pasteurization. Frozen fruit is usually pasteurized before it's frozen, and I've yet to have problems simply dropping it in without treating it. However, you will get much more color, quicker fermentation and more flavor if you blend and \"mash\" the fruit.  This also applies to frozen fruit.  I have had *wonderful* results with the method shown below. This method was given to me by user Biobrewer, so please send karma or puppies his way:\n\n*I literally mash up the fruit really well (usually a few pulses in the blender is good), and add just a little water, enough to make it fluid enough for heat to transfer (doesn't take much since there is usually a fair amount of fruit juices). I then heat up to 110 F with some pectin enzyme for 30 minutes, then pasteurize for 4-5 minutes at around 170 F. Lastly, I cool by submersion of the pot in an ice bath, sanitize the outside, and funnel the fruit mush into the fermentor and rack the beer on top.* \n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nOkay, so you've skimmed down to this far and you're thinking \"when the hell is he going to talk about actually making cider\".  Well now we can get down to business. I will go over Apfelweins, Graffs and Typical Ciders.\n\n\n\n\n1)** Apfelwein / Apple Wine **\n\n*This category is strictly regarding wines that are fermented with a strain of yeast typical to wines such as Montrachet, Coate des Blanc, Champagne etc.  A really, really good apfelwein is arguably much more complex, generally drier and usually a higher %ABV beverage than other ciders.* \n\nStrategies In Making your Wine:\n\n\n-**Do not use Montrachet or Red Wine yeast.** I commonly see Red Star Montrachet yeast suggested as I believe it is in Edwort's Apfelwein recipe. I also commonly see people who use this yeast say their cider tastes like, well, ass.  Don't confuse poor choice of yeast with poor yeast, Montrachet is a great yeast, but it is a Red Wine yeast. Your cider typically should not resemble the thickness, spicyness or richness of a red wine.  Note: Yes, you *can* use Montrachet, but more often than not you are looking at a minimum of 9 months from pitch to glass before it tastes decent and usually it still doesn't. (although we all have preferences that are different). White wine, champagne, and hybrid yeasts are much more fitting.\n\n-Firstly, I am in an area where I really only see Lalvin and Red Star strains. I have used both and it seems that Lalvin is a common brand on this sub. In my opinion, Lalvin creates superior dry yeast. I highly recommend them all. To simplify the difference for those who can't really choose (or don't care), it really comes down to how sweet, green or dry you want your wine. **My favorite is 1116(K1V).  A white/champagne hybrid that requires little to no-sweetening for a refreshing flavor in even a young wine (5 months pitch to glass minimum).  If you are on the fence about your apfelwein yeast, use 1116** A little tart, a little sweet, a little dry. \n\n-Following in favorite would be 1122. To me, it seems on the verge of a white/vino verde type yeast. \n\n-D47 is fine, but it seems to me it needs a bit more age than the 11 series and is more prone to getting that young-wine-sour-ey flavor. It usually will age out fine.\n\n-**I often steer people away from Champagne yeast because if you're just grabbing regular ol' juice off the store shelf and pitch Red Star Champagne or Lalvin 1118 (Champagne) you're going to end up with something that tastes like fizzy soda water.** Not much flavor and very, very dry. It is, however, very possible to create a good cider like this but if you do, and you want it to pop but still have lots of flavor, use fresh juice, and lots of fruit matter to your primary (i.e. apples,  blueberries, blackberries..whatever).\n\n\n\n\n2)**  Malted Cider **\n\n*This type of cider is typically known as a Graff it is a partially malted and usually lightly hopped cider.  As someone who eats beer for three meals a day, I have the authority to say that this is a beer-drinker's cider.  Graff's are wonderful. They give the type of body to a cider most beer drinkers need. It's not wine-ey and it's not too fruity. It's balanced.*\n\nMaking your Graff\n\nFirst Off, **Cider is popular among gluten-free drinkers. If you add malt to your cider, warn others that may be gluten-intolerant.**\n\n\n-**If you will search \u201cGraff Recipe\u201d you will find a HBT talk thread that will create a dry, mildly sweet and absolutely enjoyable cider. I recommend you start with this recipe if you are curious.** I am am willing to post personal favorite recipes or suggestions, but I'm not going to copy-paste a recipe that is easily searchable and who's author deserves more credit than I.\n\n-On that note, the torrified wheat isn't necessary for head retention. For a base I usually just steep pilsner, white wheat and cyrstal 20 or 60.  I get incredible head retention. \n\n-**Yeast will contribute nearly the entire character of your cider.** This isn't news for most of you.  Think it through, it will define your drink. The typical S04 will make a dry, slightly tart flavor that is totally enjoyable. I recommend most ale yeasts but I encourage you to experiment. To those unfamiliar with lots of yeast, do a little research or simply start with typical yeasts. WLP001,002,013 are always good places to start. I have done a graff with Saison yeast and it was like nothing I've ever had. Almost more cirtus-ey than apple-ey. But it was a hit on New Years.  I would, however, avoid yeasts that are notorious for generating lots of isoamyl acetate. To me, those banana flavors just clash with the apple. You may have a different opinion. \n\n-**The guidelines posted in the typical Graff Recipe call for a specific amount of hops and say \u201cif you want to change the hops, use less, not more\u201d.  For all intents and purposes, I will stick to this advice.** If you just want a typical dry cider, the suggested .5oz Cascade boiled for 30 minutes with your malt is perfect. For those of you mildly experienced, you'll probably realize this hop addition is essentially to lightly enhance existing bitterness without creating an overt, or arguably existent at all, aroma. This is correct. I'm never to positive because I'm always adding fruit which makes measuring OG a bit more of a pain, but I think you're aiming for about 7-14 IBU's in five gallons. So if you want to experiment, go for it, but this is really about IBU's, so don't just totally interchange Columbus, Saaz or Cascade without running a calculation. \n\n\n3) ** Typical Ciders **\n\n*This is just a typical cider made with no malt and ale yeast. My favorite commercial example would be Harpoon. I believe their cider is probably the best commercial top-fermented cider. I love looking at the back of the bottle... Ingredients: Fermented Apple Juice. There are no secrets with this drink except that they're actually getting fresh juice from an orchard a few miles away from their production, keeping the temperatures maintained and using an ale yeast similar (read identical) to their typical ales.*\n\n-There isn't too much to say here because the process is pretty straightforward. Get your juice or make your must, drop your yeast in. Take gravity readings and bottle.\n\n- - - - - - - - - \n\nSome questions you may have:\n\n**Do I need to make a starter?**\n\n-*Sigh*. Listen, you don't have to make a starter. You also don't have to tie your shoes, but your day is going to be more difficult if you keep tripping over your laces. Use regular extra-light LME. Yes, you can get away with pitching just a vial or smack pack. Your cider will turn out fine. Making starters is just a good habit to be in.\n\n-Disregard this if you are using dry yeast, and yes, one packet is enough.\n\n**Does temperature matter?**\n\n-Of course it does. If temperatures are an issue for you, choose a yeast appropriate for your range. Focus on esters you want to avoid or create. As a rule of thumb, you can't go wrong around 65F. \n\n\n**What if I want to add something to my cider?**\n\n-Then do it, I'm not your mother. I don't really care because you're probably not going to give me any of it anyway. Just search. Someone has added that ingredient and I'm sure wrote about it in detail previously on this sub, HBT, etc. Don't get ambitious. You can always add more, you can't really add less.  \n\n\n**How long until I can drink it?** \n\n-How patient are you? For wine yeasts, I usually recommend a **minimum** of 1 month primary and 2 months secondary. Then another 3-8 months in a bottle.  Even with ale-oriented ciders, I usually need a bit of age on my ciders and they will improve with a few extra weeks in a fermenter, especially if you're going to just drop it in a keg and drink it in a week.\n\n-You have to remember that fruit is fairly lazily fermenting, especially if added in secondary. So account for that and give the appropriate time needed, especially if your drink is destined for bottles.\n\n-For ales, give it at least three weeks to secondary, or just five weeks in a primary. Or longer. If I'm not in a hurry I do 1 month primary, 1 month secondary. Why do I secondary? Because I do. Don't argue with me about it. If you don't like it, don't do it. I also am usually adding extra juice or fruit to secondary so it's nicer to siphon-on than dump-in.  \n\n\n**I want to have a sweet, carbonated cider, but I don't want to backsweeten with lactose or splenda, what do I do?**\n\nIt depends on whether you bottle or keg\n\n\n**If you keg. It's easy. You can kill your yeast and add whatever you want.** I usually drink a few glasses back and then add a half gallon of juice to the 4ish gallons remaining. Do you need to add sorbate? I get away with not doing it by keeping everything cold enough, especially when you add new juice.  If your keg is going to get warm, add the sorbate. I haven't had problems with off-flavors. But make sure you add enough. Aggressive yeasts can maintain plenty of activity if the concentration of sorbate isn't high enough.\n\n-Original Sin is a very unique cider created by fermenting with champagne yeast, killing it with sorbate before it ferments out entirely and lightly carbonated. Give it a try if you can get your hands on it. It's got quite an interesting mouthfeel and I actually enjoy it.\n\n**If you bottle, it's more tricky, but not impossible**. \n\n-When using wine yeast. Primary in one jug. Let it ferment out. Then split it in half between two secondary fermenters half-filled with fresh, non-fermented juice. You will retain much more sweetness this way. And hey dude, now you have twice the cider! It's like magic that gets you drunk. \n\n-When using ale-yeast, the process is essentially the same. But don't entirely split your batch. Just leave a gallon out at primary and add it in secondary.\n\n\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nOk, *deep breath* I think I covered most of what I want to. I apologize for the wordiness but it's easier for me to type all of this out now and just copy paste it from my history when people ask questions in five days because this inevitably end up buried. \n\nI encourage you to ask and answer questions. I also encourage you to disagree with me. We all have opinions and this write up is much more from experience and not laboratory science. Technically I'm a scientist, *but not that kind of scientist*.  \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/16xloy/the_big_cider_making_post/", "created_utc": 1358698054.0, "score": 504, "author": "Beer_Is_Food", "num_comments": 154, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/16xloy/the_big_cider_making_post/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Water Chemistry for Dummies - A Practical Guide", "selftext": "I thought I'd write a dumbed down guide to the practical application of brewing water chemistry since this topic seems to cause a lot of confusion and many homebrewers see it as a big hurdle to overcome.\n\nThis guide is written for homebrewers that have been holding back from getting into water adjustments due to confusion or intimidation regarding the topic. It will not go into great detail in water chemistry and acid/base equilibria. Instead, I will focus on learning how to use a spreadsheet to do the adjustments. You can become self sufficient in brewing water without diving into too much theory.\n\n**How Important is Water Chemistry?**\n\nWater chemistry is down the list of things you should worry about. Sanitation, fermentation temperature control, and yeast management are far more effective things to nail before tweaking water chemistry, according to John Palmer in How to Brew.\n\nOnce you've sorted those things out and removed any glaring flaws from your process, you can focus on adjusting water chemistry to improve your brews. This will allow you to \"season\" your beers to accentuate desired flavors and control the acidity of the final product so your beers will taste right. Both those things are important - it's more than just mineral profile.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nBefore beginning, go to your homebrewing store and buy calcium chloride, gypsum, and either a pound of milled acidulated malt OR lactic acid. I got all of these for around $6 and they will last for many batches. If you are using tap water, you should also pick up campden tablets.\n\nNext, go download yourself the [EZ Water Calculator](http://www.ezwatercalculator.com/) spreadsheet. There is another more complicated spreadsheet available called Bru'N Water which works almost the same way but with more inputs and arguably a better pH estimation model. We'll use EZ today because it is so simple to learn, and then you can switch to Bru'N water or another calculator later if you'd like (Brewer's Friend works pretty well).\n\n**Using the Water Spreadsheet**\n\nWe will be using a simple 5 gallon BIAB witbier recipe as an example throughout this guide. [This image](https://i.imgur.com/MMeWXAs.png) shows how to fill out the spreadsheet. The steps are described in more detail below:\n\n1. *Water profile goes at the top*. If you are using bottled spring or RO water, check the label for the water profile. If you are using tap water, search for a water report online, or call the utility and ask for the Ca, Mg, SO4, Cl, Na, and alkalinity levels, or have the water tested. If you are using distilled water, leave everything at zero! Alkalinity may be given in ppm CaCO3 or ppm HCO3. EZ lets you enter either. I am using the profile from the 5 gallon jugs of spring water that I bought.\n\n2. *Fill out the mash water and sparge water amounts*. In this example, I have 7 gallons of mash water and no sparge water.\n\n3. *Fill out your recipe*. If you input any crystal malts, you'll have to fill out the Lovibond values as well. On the right, you'll see pH values calculated as you enter malts. As you'll see, the calculated mash pH is going to be in part a weighted average of these values. Roasted malts all contribute similarly so things like chocolate malt can simply go under the roasted malt category. \n\n4. *Input your salt additions*. In a subsequent section I'll show you how to figure those out.\n\n5. *Input acid additions*. EZ lets you input acidulated malt or lactic acid. In a subsequent section I'll show you how to figure those out.\n\n6. *Input your base additions*. I'll show you how to do this in another section but most recipes won't require this.\n\n**Water Chemistry Goals**\n\nNow, on to some basic theory. With brewing water chemistry, there are 3 things that you, the homebrewer, wish to accomplish:\n\n1. Remove chlorine and chloramine to prevent nasty band-aid flavored chlorophenols.\n\n2. Hit the target mineral profile.\n\n3. Get the correct mash pH.\n\n*Item 1* is dead simple - use filtered water or dissolve 1 campden tablet per 20 gallons of tap water. Done.\n\n*Item 2* is achieved with your brewing salts (calcium chloride and gypsum). \n\n*Item 3* is frequently missed by homebrewers, but it is critically important. Not only will this help with conversion and preventing tannin extraction, proper mash pH will lead to the right beer pH, which will result in flavors being properly delivered to your palate. High pH beer is dull and watery. Low pH beer is one dimensional. Determining the correct mash pH is highly dependent on many variables, but sticking between 5.2 and 5.6 will get you in the right ballpark.\n\nOnce you enter your water and recipe, you'll see a huge calculated mash pH value in the middle of the spreadsheet. If you play around with the inputs, you'll notice the following (try it!):\n\n- Adding darker malts brings the pH down.\n\n- Adding calcium (or Magnesium) brings the pH down.\n\n- Acid additions bring the pH down.\n\n- Adding chloride and sulphate have no effect on mash pH.\n\n- When alkalinity is low (< 40 ppm CaCO3), it doesn't take much to bring the pH down.\n\n- When alkalinity is high (> 150 ppm CaCO3), it takes a lot to bring the pH down.\n\nIt is important to remember that Calcium and Magnesium ions increase hardness which lowers pH. Sulphate and Chloride ions are for flavor only.\n\n**Salt additions**\n\nSalt and acid addition is done by trial and error. First, you must identify a target mineral profile and mash pH for your recipe. Here are some guidelines on target profiles if your recipe doesn't include one:\n\n- Calcium should be between 50-150 ppm.\n\n- Magnesium doesn't matter. You only need a little bit and the grains will provide it.\n\n- Chloride accentuates malt flavors. Sulphate accentuates hop flavors.\n\n- When in doubt, balance the chloride and sulphate levels. They don't need to be exactly equal for a balanced beer, but don't have one double the other.\n\n- For IPAs and styles where you want the hops to shine, swing the chloride/sulphate balance towards sulphate. IPAs might have 2,3,4,5, or more times as much sulphate as chloride. We would say that an IPA has a 4:1 sulphate to chloride ratio, for example (that's also a great starting point if you are brewing an IPA).\n\n- Add up the ppm of calcium, magnesium, sulphate, chloride, and sodium. Lighter bodied beers may be under 100 ppm total (more than 50% is Calcium!). Medium beers will be between 100 - 400 ppm. Getting above 500 ppm gives a real firm-structured beer. Exceeding the limits shown on the spreadsheet will result in gross minerally tasting beer, so be careful.\n\n- Don't look up the water profile for a specific city and try to match that. The brewers there probably aren't just using untreated water; they are also manipulating the profile.\n\nFor our witbier example, we want a balanced beer with some body. Therefore, I want something in the range of 200 ppm total minerals, with sulphate and chloride balanced, and at least 50 ppm of calcium. There are lots of options, but something like *75 Ca, 75 Cl, 75 SO4* with low Mg and Na levels should do the trick.\n\nNext, I'll start adding calcium chloride and gypsum to EZ (step 4). Both of these salts add calcium, but calcium chloride adds chloride whereas gypsum adds sulphate. After some mucking around, I ended up with 3 grams of gypsum and 4 grams of calcium chloride to [give this mineral profile](https://i.imgur.com/3mjndQz.png). \n\nNotice that I'm roughly where I want to be (Mg is low but the grains will add enough). Also notice that the mash pH has gone down because of the calcium, but it still isn't low enough. That means we must use acid additions to adjust the pH down further.\n\n**Acid Additions**\n\nHaving hit my water profile, it's time to add some acid. Witbier is pale, so I'll be targeting the middle of the pH range - about 5.40. Please keep in mind that estimating mash pH is tough to do and different spreadsheets use different models. Just because EZ says it will be 5.40 doesn't mean squat. However, if EZ says it will be 5.80, it's pretty safe to say you need some acid addition. The only way to nail 5.40 for sure is to test your mash with a pH meter and adjust acid on the fly.\n\nI don't have a working pH meter right now, so at least I am leaving myself some bumper room on each side. I can add either acidulated malt or lactic acid to my mash to bring the pH down. [Here is what happens when I add 5 ounces of acidulated malt](https://i.imgur.com/W6xe8yb.png). The mash pH drops to 5.52. As a rule of thumb, you don't want to add more than 3-4% acidulated malt to the grain bill, and I am sitting at about 3%. I could use some other acids or add a bit more acidulated malt, or add some more calcium. In this case, I may add another 1% acid malt and then brew.\n\n**Base Additions**\n\nMost of the time, you will find yourself trying to lower mash pH. If you are trying to brew a particularly dark beer with low alkalinity water, you may find that the pH prediction is too low and needs to be brought up. I typically don't encounter this problem, but if you do, you can add some baking soda to bring the pH up. EZ can handle this.\n\n**Some Notes on Water Source**\n\nGenerally, if you are getting your water from a surface source like a river, you can expect lower mineral content, lower alkalinity, but higher levels of chlorine/chloramine (especially in the summer). This water is easy to adjust but gives you the highest risk of undershooting pH in a dark beer.\n\nWater from a well is typical rich in dissolved minerals, high in alkalinity, but low in organic matter. You may find it difficult to get the mash pH low enough without some good acid addition. If that's the case, try cutting with bottled water to reduce the alkalinity.\n\nDistilled water basically has nothing in it. Having no alkalinity will make your water extremely sensitive to any grain or acid additions. Calcium, Magnesium, and base additions will act to increase the effective alkalinity and make things a little more stable.\n\n**Water Chemistry for Extract Beers**\n\nWhen your extract was made, the brewer took care of water chemistry for you (if it's good quality stuff). All the ions you need are in the extract, so if you mix it with distilled water you should theoretically end up with what the brewer intended. If you use water that has minerals in it, you'll be adding more to the extract wort.\n\nFor best results, use low mineral, low alkalinity water for your extract brews. Well water, for example, might be a bad choice due to the high mineral content and high alkalinity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere is a lot more to the theory of brewing water chemistry that I wanted to include, but it really makes more sense to focus on learning a spreadsheet first. Playing around with it will give you some intuition for how the brewing salts, grains, and acids affect your mash water.\n\nI am not a chemist. I am an engineer by profession, so my purpose is to do something useful while getting all the science and math wrong. Be nice and criticize constructively - we are in a glorious age of information where all homebrewers should have access to the tools and knowledge to optimize their brewing.\n\nHappy Brewing,\n\n-Lenny\n\nEdit 1 and 3: Thank you to /u/Nash_Rambler for gilding this post. I appreciate it and I'm glad you enjoyed it. Another thanks to an anonymous poster that gilded as well. The both of you are too kind. Now go drink some beer! \n\nEdit 2: My friend asked me a very good question about mineral concentration due to boil off. The minerals will become more concentrated during the boil. Typically I don't care as there is lots of room for play in the exact numbers. If you are doing a very small batch, you may want to consider the boil rate and adjust your mineral profile downwards while still hitting the desired mash pH.

{"title": "New England Double Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Tropical Salted Caramel Double Dry Hopped Extra Oat Cream Vanilla Milkshake Chocolate Raspberry Icecream Sour White Stout Infused with Mint, Hibiscus and Truffle oil beer - Recipe", "selftext": "On Friday, June 11th 2021 03:27:48 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time) /u/innsource made a post requesting a recipe.  A recipe that requires a very particular set of ingredients.  Ingredients that make beer a nightmare for people like you (and me).\n\nI don't really like nightmares, and I sort of like making crazy recipes (even if they may not work, but I try!), so I really wanted to give this a go.  What I have below is not me blowing smoke up your ass.  It's a legit attempt at something that covers all of the basis for what a \"good\" New England Double Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Tropical Salted Caramel Double Dry Hopped Extra Oat Cream Vanilla Milkshake Chocolate Raspberry Icecream Sour White Stout Infused with Mint, Hibiscus and Truffle oil beer should be.\n\n---\n\nSo let's break this down first into some keywords and flavor profiles commonly associated with them and see if we can't do some combining:\n\n* New England - A less defined hop bitterness but more defined aroma and flavor.  Smoother mouthfeel.  Will likely be more opaque\n* Double - Higher ABV\n* BBA - Bourbon Barrel aged\n* Imperial - Higher ABV\n* Tropical - (hops?  fruit?)\n* Salted Caramel - what it is\n* DDH - Arguable, I prefer the \"2 dry hop additions\" definition\n* Extra - ?\n* Oat - Oats (maybe oat cream = oat milk?)\n* Cream - Lactose\n* Vanilla - Vanilla\n* Milkshake - Usually just lactose\n* Chocolate - Chocolate (particular malts like pale chocolate, carafa II, cacao etc.)\n* Raspberry - The fruit\n* Sour - Lower pH, higher TA, lactic acid\n* Icecream - ehhhhh, we'll go lactose-y\n* White Stout - sweeter coffee blonde with chocolate and vanilla\n* Mint, Hibiscus, Truffle oil\n\nSo now that we have, you know, *some* flavors we're going for let's look at malts.\n\nSo I think between the Double, BBA, Imperial, and maybe extra qualifiers we're going to want to focus on this being a big boy.  Let's do 12% coming out of the FV.  We'll also target 5.5 gallons.\n\nI start a lot of sentences with \"So\" apparently.\n\nNow the tricky part is that we want this to be sort of a NE style sour White Stout...basically.  This is actually kinda ok and workable.  I think based on those descriptors I almost want to say that we should use Pilsner malt.  It just feels right, I have a gut feeling.\n\nAlso I'll say this for the recipe, I'll add %'s but my efficiency goes to pit when I brew these higher OG beers so I'm targeting closer to a 60% efficiency with this.\n\nSo let's rock out 17 pounds of that to start.  We also need to make sure that we get some wheat and oats (for the NEIPA, though this is debatable, but I think it plays into white stout too).  So let's do 4 pounds of white wheat malt, and 3 pounds of flaked oats.  Because I'm going to suggest Philly Sour later (despite around a 9% abv tolerance which I bet we can crush) let's do .5# of corn sugar too.  And lactose because...lactose.\n\nSo we're looking at:\n\n* 17# Pilsner (70.6%)\n* 4# White Wheat (15.6%)\n* 3# Flaked Oats (11.8%)\n* 1# Lactose\n* .5# Dextrose (2%)\n\nBecause we need to cover \"salted caramel\" I think that what we want to do maybe mash with just a bit of extra water and caramelize-ish one gallon of our first runnings.  After mashing for about 20 minutes collect a gallon and start heating that bad boy up and get it boiling.  We'll just sparge right into the boiled runnings after the full hour is up.  We'll do salt later.\n\nAlright, so hops.  What hops are sort of vanilla-y, citrusy, fruity, may go well with high sugar content, and may age well.\n\nMy very first thought would be to go for some Lotus hops followed by a more traditional Citra.  I don't think we want to get too complex here because we have a lot of adjuncts we're going to be messing with too.\n\nSo considering we want some \"BBA\" to this, how are we going to utilize the hops?  How are we going to not completely screw up something \"New England-ish\" while also aging a little?  Let's brainstorm!  We'll look at the BBA stuff and then the hops next.\n\nSo as many of us know, hop forward beers tend to be very sensitive to oxygen.  In general, this makes IPAs a poor candidate for aging typically.  So....what if we do the \"aging\" as it's fermenting and split the difference?  We can try to get as much of the wood and bourbon flavor into the beer as we can while oxygen really isn't present, and then let everything mellow just a little bit while the beer is carbonating in a keg.  This is a legitimate question, I don't really know, but I also don't think it's the worst solution here.\n\nI say let's go for it.\n\nBut what bourbon?  Or!  Do we cheat?  Because we're targeting something more vanilla forward what if we use Vanilla Crown?  Is it a little fake?  Sure.  It's not bourbon!  Well...yeah.  Is it a little sweet?  Well that's probably for the best in this beer.  In general I find that if I tell people what flavors they need to find in my beer they'll find them, so if we just tell people this is \"bourbon barrel aged\" I think they'll bite.  So how do we do it?\n\nWell!  It just so turns out that we need to include mint, hibiscus, and truffle oil as well.  I think it's time that we consider an oak spiral / honeycomb in a tincture.  But let's go big.\n\nSo let's get a tincture going about a month before fermentation will be complete.  One 5\" spiral / honeycomb is typically enough for 5 gallons of beer.  If you find that your wood can fit into the bottle as is (heh) take your bottle of crown and pour one out for your weird ass beer (into your mouth, preferably), then another, and then maybe another.  Clear some room out.  If the wood can't fit into the bottle then find a container that can hold your whole fifth.  With all of that liquor combine a single 5\" oak spiral, 2oz. mint, 6oz, hibiscus, and whatever truffle oil you feel comfortable putting in.  Hell yeah.\n\nAlright, so now we do hops.  I don't actually think this is going to be quite as big of an issue as whatever that tincture we're going to add is going to do.  With the raspberry we're adding as well it's possible that a lot of the more delicate flavors that the hops are going to add are going to get overshadowed a bit so I think we go a little lighter than a standard New England.  I don't think that we do any bittering hops, but we do do some whirlpool and dry hop additions.  I think that we also add our wood and tincture when we do our second dry hop (remember DDH!).\n\nSo, we're using Lotus and Citra.  Let's keep it simple.  2oz of each hop whirlpooled at 160F for 30 minutes, 1oz of each hop added at high krausen, 1oz of each hop added day 5 or 6.  I'm targeting a time where fermentation isn't going to be complete, but doesn't have a ton of time left.  Philly is odd in that it creates a lot of the lactic acid up front, sort of pretends to stall for a bit, and then kicks back up and produces most of the ethanol.  I think somewhere around day 5-6 with a large pitch and some oxygen would be a good time.  We're going to add most of our adjuncts here too because, again, we're really trying not to expose this to too much oxygen.\n\nSo around day 6ish we're going to add our last dry hop addition, 5# raspberries, 2 vanilla beans (notice that these are not in the tincture), and .#5 of cacao nibs that have been toasted in the oven for about 10 minutes (or until your house smells like brownies), and...I really have no idea how much of the tincture.  Toss that wood piece in and add like 1/4 of the bottle?  If it needs more bourbon go ahead and just add some Buffalo Trace.  Excellent.\n\nWe also need to cover \"tropical\".  I'm actually sort of a fan of straight pineapple juice in secondary.  Crack open a 29oz. can and pour 'er in.  Oh that's sexy.\n\nLet all of that sit until about 3 days after fermentation completes and then closed transfer it to a keg.  I normally burst carb, but I think this one will need some time to become the beer that it's father knew it could always be.  Set it at your normal serving pressure and give it a few weeks, serve, and enjoy.  Or don't, I didn't make this you did, that's not on me.\n\nSo let's break it down into a more concise recipe:\n-----\n\n* 17# Pilsner (70.6%)\n* 4# White Wheat (15.6%)\n* 3# Flaked Oats (11.8%)\n* 1# Lactose\n* .5# Dextrose (2%)\n\nAnd then...\n\n* Mash at 148F for 60 minutes.\n* 20 minutes in collect 1 gallon of wort and start to boil it.  Aim for like a quart of thick syrup when you're ready to sparge.\n* Mash the rest for 40 more minutes.\n* Boil for 60 minutes with no boil additions\n* Whirlpool with 2oz Citra and 2oz Lotus for 30 minutes at 160F\n* Chill to pitching temp (let's roll with mid-high 60's)\n* If you have the ability, oxygenate with O2 and then pitch 3 (!) packs of Philly Sour.  It may be a bit of an overpitch but I'm counting on a healthy fermentation blowing the 9% normal attenuation out of the water.\n* At high krausen dry hop with 1oz Citra and 1oz Lotus\n* After six days dry hop with 1oz Citra and 1oz Lotus as well as:\n  * Add (slowly) 5# raspberries\n  * Add 2 vanilla beans\n  * Add 8oz toasted cacao nibs\n  * Add 1/3 of tincture?  1/4?  I really don't know.  Less??  Palmer help us.\n  * Dat wood\n  * Salt Bae the beer\n* Let fermentation complete (maybe up to another week) and then closed transfer it to a keg\n* Slowly carb it over the course of a week or two\n* Serve and flex your amazing homebrew muscle\n\nIf you brew this PM me and I will pay for you to send me and /u/innsource some bottles.\n\nUnless there are like thousands of you who are that mad.

{"title": "How to bottle beer", "selftext": "Just a quick rundown on the step by step process I use to bottle beer. I hope this can be educational for you all.\n\n1. Confirm fermentation has complete by taking 2 or more hydrometer samples several days apart. Alternately: realize you have yet to bother checking gravity, but today is like the only day you'll have free for a week or more, so do it anyway. YOLO.\n\n2. Confirm you have enough bottles on hand to package your yield. You never do. Enlist friends and family to help you chug a 6-Pack or two, and consider dumpster diving.\n\n3. Make sure those bottles have been de-labeled. It's best to de-label as you drink bottles to reduce having to do it all at once. You'll never take that advice, however, and will instead spend the next 2 hours cursing your favorite brewery for using what must be super glue on these god damn things.\n\n4. Make sure your bottles are fully cleaned. As with de-labeling, it's best to clean or at least rinse these as you go. But not you. You're a lazy and pitiful human being and will spend another few hours scrubbing god knows what out of these bottles. Was that a maggot? I don't want to think about it.\n\n5. Sanitize your bottling equipment: bottling bucket, auto-siphon, bottling wand, tubing, etc.\n\n6. Realize you ran out of Star-San. Fuck. Remember you were supposed to pick some up last time? Get it together, Sean....promise yourself today that you will stop putting things off for another day. Ok, trip to the home brew store.\n\n7. Get back home, realize you've misplaced something. I don't know what, but trust me, it's something. Probably the little plastic tip of your bottle wand. Ask yourself if you want to spend an hour ripping apart your garage, or just buy another at the homebrew store. Also ask yourself why you don't get your god damn life together. Get organized, stop losing shit. Maybe eat better too. Ok, stop thinking of that now, just go back to the home brew shop.\n\n8. \"Back again so soon? Did ya forget something?\" HA HA HA HA HA. Fuck you, homebrew shop guy.\n\n9. Ok, you have everything. Let's calculate how much sugar you need for carbonation using an online calculator. Spend the next 20 minutes trying to figure out what the Beer Temperature field is supposed to mean on these sites. Like, the temp it is right now? The temp it fermented at? What if I fermented it cold at first, then raised the temp? Whatever, I need to get back to this. Guestimate how much sugar is needed and throw it in a pot with some water, and bring it to a boil.\n\n10. While waiting for the boil, sanitize your bottles. Break at least 2, as you're probably drunk by this point.\n\n11. Something is burning. You forgot about the sugar. Now you have caramel burnt to the bottom of your nice pot. Curse. Do it again.\n\n12. All right! Time to rack from your fermentor to your bottling bucket. Before you begin, make sure that the spigot on your bottling bucket is turned OFF.\n\n13. Struggle for 10 minutes trying to fit your tubing on to the racking cane. Double check the spigot again. This day has been long enough and you don't want a mess.\n\n14. Begin racking from the fermentor to the bucket.\n\n15. You left the spigot open. God damnit, Sean. You always leave the fucking spigot open. When will you learn?\n\n16. Clean up the big mess you just made. Cry.\n\n17. Struggle for 10 minutes to remove the tubing from the racking cane, and struggle another 10 to get it on to your brand new bottling wand. Don't use your teeth trying to remove the tube from the cane. You should already know by now that it just doesn't work.\n\n18. Begin bottling your beer. I like to fill 10 bottles, cap, then gently stir the beer to make sure the sugar is still evenly mixed....OH FUCK YOU FORGOT TO PUT THE SUGAR IN. God fucking damnit! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Can this day get any worse? \n\n19. By now you've dumped whatever you bottled back in to the bucket, added your sugar solution, and gently mixed. Begin bottling again.\n\n20. Finally. Done. Don't worry about cleanup, you've had a long day. Just throw it all in to a box or something and deal with it tomorrow, probably.\n\n21. Store bottles at room temperature, but out of direct sunlight. Let them carb naturally for 2-3 weeks before enjoying. But we all know you're going to try after 5 days.\n\n22. Spend the evening researching kegging.\n\nI hope this was helpful to everyone.

{"title": "A quick warning about etching yor stainless kettle.", "selftext": "I saw with great interest the posts here about etching your stainless kettles.  Not wanting to blow $100 that I spent on my kettle, I asked my brother-in-law, who happens to be a PhD metallurgist and a 30 year specialist in stainless steel.  I asked if the battery and vinegar process could cause problems with corrosion on a kettle.  This was his reply:\n\nExcellent question.  Are you sure you're not a metallurgist?  Anyway, yes, probably these etched areas would be prone to corrosion and (worse) might cause your beer to have a metallic taste for the first post-etching batch or two.\n\nInteresting how a little knowledge can be dangerous.  A fascinating little idea about how to ruin the very expensive stainless kettle that I have gone to a lot of trouble to make. [Since his company produces stainless steel]\n\nAll is not lost!  All we need to do is make sure the etched areas have their corrosion resistance restored!  We can easily do this with materials found around the home.  What I would suggest is soaking a washcloth in lemon juice, laying it on top of the etchings (maybe by turning it sideways), and getting it hot somehow - say, 180 deg. F or thereabouts, so we don't boil the lemon juice off but we have some impetus for the passivation reaction.  I guess you could put it in the oven on \"low\".  An hour or two should do it.  If it dries out you could just pour some more lemon juice on it.  Lime juice would work of course.  Or just plain lemons.  Nitric acid is normally used, but who has that laying around?  Plus it's dangerous.  \n\nI hope to see your etched and passivated kettle in a couple of months!\n\nEdit: Oops, sorry about the typo in the title.

She is let off by a car, which never stops near the house but instead stops further up the block and let's her off and she walks the rest of the distance.\n\nI noticed her taking more care of her looks, and she spends more time in the bathroom putting on make up before work than she ever did before. I am not sure, but I also noticed her smelling faintly of men's perfume... she also declines all my advances in the bedroom and is always \"too tired\" whereas she was much more lively before.\n\nLast night I was standing in the living room window trying to catch a glimpse but I could not see anything clearly about which car was dropping her off. \n\nTonight she was late as usual.

{"title": "I May Have Accidentally Become a Head Brewer", "selftext": "Hi guys - I'm using a \"burner\" account for privacy reasons that I will detail below. Additionally, I understand how stupid this situation sounds, so if your response to the situation below is \"you're not ready, quit,\" I already have these voices in my head, so thank you for your encouragement.\n\nBackground: My wife and I have lived in a Developing Country (DC) for about six years now, working jobs that pay the bills but mine really doesn't satisfy me. Additionally, there is very little beer in DC and imports are about triple the price of what I'd pay back at home. So a few years ago my wife and I began homebrewing. As most people in DC have never had or even heard of homebrew, people are impressed with both my process (rough and cheap) and also the product (pretty good).\n\nA few months ago someone approached me about selling my beer to locals, just via word of mouth. This went well and my beer sold out quickly, especially my IPA. One of the people who bought it decided to connect me with \"a friend who owns a cafe\" in a trendy part of town. He said his friend would be interested in selling my beer on the side (no permits, etc).\n\nSituation: Today I met with the \"friend who owns a cafe\" and he doesn't just own a cafe. He's a typical DC rich kid who just graduated business school and has an incredible amount of money for investment (in most DC's the income gap is massive and rich kids have full access to daddy's purse. It's disgusting, but what can you do?). We met at his newest development, a massive outdoor food court for the trendy crowd in the hippest part of the city. It has dozens of restaurants and needs beer!\n\nWhen we met, I had the intention of brewing a couple of batches a month, hoping he'd take care of sales in a cafe or food stall. That's where I was wrong.\n\nOver the course of the next two hours he told me that he is able to secure the funding to open up a brewery that is capable of producing 10,000 bottles a week for his network of cafes throughout the country. And he said that my beer and knowledge would be the head of it. I was not ready for this, and I was also not ready for his aspirations. He wants to start immediately (he has no idea how long brewing can take though) and wanted 1000 bottles by Friday. I told him no, but we kept talking. \n\nNow, I did not tell him that I had only homebrewed before. And I didn't tell him that I had no idea how commercial breweries work. If you see at the top, I'm sick of my job and am desperate for a new direction in life. I have no idea, but this is possibly a chance to start something new. I have to use this account because I am currently on a visa paid for by my employer, and side jobs are not allowed. \n\nThat's where this sub comes in. I have been reading and posting on here for a long time and this community is my haven. I was wondering what steps I should take over the next year as we begin to talk with manufacturers, distributors, growers and the like. I literally have no idea where to start. \n\nI have been assured that I will be in charge of only the beer-making aspects. He will handle purchasing, marketing and funding. I will be giving him a big share of the company because I'm in it nearly risk free. So I just need to know how breweries work and what I should do as I become an accidental brewer.\n\nBut I don't know where to start.\n\nMy first step, I'm assuming is this: I will travel to a nearby first-world country and buy four Grainfathers. I will begin brewing small batches to figure out what style and variation connects with the locals. With this, and a part-time employee, I can produce about 500 bottles/week. We will test these out at different cafes until we have a recipe that really works. During this time we will work on government approval, forms and purchasing the big equipment.\n\nThe problem is that I also don't know what kind of equipment I need!\n\nI know I sound ignorant. I am. But this may be my only shot at ever being a brewer and getting out of my current job. Any advice, links or encouragement is very much appreciated. And, again, if you want to say something like \"you have no idea what you're doing,\" you're right.

I have had some customers on the fence about buying SSBT equipment because of the high price tag. When I saw the sale I logged on to the wholesale portal I saw the sale was also applicable to retail outlets. \n\nI contacted the customers and let them know, about the sale and if they were interested to let me know. A few customers were definitely interested and wanted to get it through me to support a small business. When I tried to place the order the ordering page was locked out.\n\nI contacted retail support, no answer. I contacted them via social media, no answer. I submit a trouble ticket and 1 day later they respond saying:\n\n\"Sales are only available directly through our webstore and are not available direct to retailers at this time.

{"title": "Hey new folks, all grain is great, and shiny equipment is great, but *you* can make great beer using extract and buckets.", "selftext": "Some of you know me, some of you don't.  I haven't been as active here lately as I used to be, but I still keep tabs once in a while.  Something happened yesterday and I just wanted to put this out here.\n\nI own a homebrew supply store.  I have been brewing for a number of years, and I continue to use a variety of methods, depending on what I am brewing, and why I am brewing.  Three vessel, brew in a bag, extract, I still do them all.  And I want you to know that you can make really good beer with just extract fermented in a bucket.  And I have proof.\n\nLast year, while I was at HomebrewCon in Portland, my wife was watching the store for me.  My wife does not brew, hell, she doesn't even really like beer that much, she much prefers wine.  But she figured that since she was running the store, she would brew a batch of beer.\n\nSo over the phone, from 3,000 miles away, she asked me for a recipe for a Raspberry Wheat.  I walked her through what I would do, and while she didn't completely disregard what I said, she came up with her own recipe.\n\nAs it turns out, the beer was pretty damn good.  I brought it to our local homebrew club meeting and our Learn to Homebrew Day event, and some folks even told her that she should enter it in to some competitions.  Well, that batch was gone pretty quickly and we didn't have a chance to enter it in to anything.\n\nA few weeks ago, she decided to brew that beer again, and I entered it in to a local BJCP sanctioned competition.  Our club was able to get David Houseman to be a guest judge, and as luck would have it, he judged the flight that my wife's beer was in.\n\nThat beer, from only the second time that she's ever brewed, was given a 38 by David, and if I recall correctly, was given a 36 from the whole table.  The most common comment from the table was that she should tone the raspberry down a bit, but otherwise it was a great beer.  I agree with them, the raspberry *is* over the top, but that was the way she wanted it.\n\nAny way, here is the recipe and equipment involved:\n\n**Jenn's Raspberry Wheat**\n\nCategory 29A Fruit Beer - Base Style 1D American Wheat Beer, Fruit: Raspberries\n\nOG: 1.059\n\nFG: 1.014\n\nIBUs: 5\n\nABV: 6%\n\n6.6 lbs Wheat LME\n\n1lb Sparkling Amber DME\n\n1oz Hallertau Mittelfrueh @ 60 mins\n\nSafale US-05\n\n5.25 lbs frozen raspberries\n\nThe beer was fermented at room temp (about 67F this time of year) in a bucket for one week.  5.25 lbs of frozen raspberries were added to a mesh bag in another bucket and then the beer was racked over from primary to the new bucket.  Fermentation continued for one more week and the beer was racked in to a CO2 purged keg.\n\nThat's it. Super simple, super tasty.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that all grain brewing is bad - far from it.  It's still my preferred method.  And I'm not saying that carboys or stainless steel fermentors are unnecessary.  All I'm saying is that you can make great beer with simple ingredients, and a simple process.\n\nDon't get hung up on chasing the newest gear.  Focus on the beer.\n\nEdit: how about a picture of the [actual beer](https://i.imgur.com/DJxyvv7.jpg)?\n\nFor some reason the camera doesn't really show how red this beer is.\n\nEdit2: Some folks are asking for more detailed instructions.  Well, I am working on creating a kit for this beer for our store and I have just finished typing up the instructions.

{"title": "Got to brew with my local brewery, and they put my beer on tap", "selftext": "Sharing a cool recent experience as a homebrewer.\n\nI live in the SF Bay Area, and have been a regular of [Alpha Acid](https://www.alphaacidbrewing.com/) since they opened.\n\nI've been a homebrewer for going on four years now, done extract, BIAB, K-RIMS, and currently an all-grain three vessel gravity fed system, 50+ brews (+ ciders\\\\meads\\\\wine).  I often bring my latest creations to the brewery to share/get critiques, etc.  I *love* Belgian's, and over the pandemic I've brewed 8-ish quads now of my own design, based on what we do as homebrewers:  Combining other recipes and seeing how they turn out.  And I've been pretty pleased with the results.\n\nBased on the relationship I've built with the team there over the years, they invited me over early Sept (had to take a day off from work... \"everyone understood\", lol) to brew one of my quad recipes with them.  They scaled it up from my 5 gallons to their \\~250-ish and we got to work.  Was a great day (started at 10am, ended around 7pm), and really makes me appreciate brewing as a profession even more.  So much cleaning, moving equipment, cleaning, weighting, cleaning, milling, cleaning, mashing, cleaning, boiling, cleaning, transferring, cleaning etc.\n\nToday they released it on tap:   I named it 'Nice Quads'. About 5 barrels total were made : They've put one on tap now, and the other four are aging in bourbon barrels:  Looking forward to trying out the 'bourbon-barrel aged quad' in another 6-9 months!\n\nHomebrewing has been a great hobby, bringing various friends and I together on a regular basis.  But it was enlightening/informative to do it on a larger scale with the pros, and celebrate that work with my friends today at the brewery.\n\nOh right:  1.5 months after brewing, the beer is really enjoyable! (I'm biased, but all my friends that came out gave it good marks... of course they're biased too).  Smooth, dark tasty malts, low bitter, goes down easy.  I'm not sure the exact ratios they used based on my original recipe, but overall it was:  2-row, special-B, dark Munich, honey malt, acidulated malt, amber candi sugar, blackstrap molasses with some Warrior hops at 60 min and Safbrew Abbey Ale yeast :  Came out at 11% ABV.\n\nRelease on their board:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ykjHfF4](https://imgur.com/a/ykjHfF4)\n\nTheir Instagram promotion:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/CVWFTTeBKwR/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVWFTTeBKwR/)\n\nSome pics of the brewday:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/CTWTRHGLyLG/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTWTRHGLyLG/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/qejgnn/got_to_brew_with_my_local_brewery_and_they_put_my/", "created_utc": 1635044031.0, "score": 452, "author": "warpcat", "num_comments": 74, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/qejgnn/got_to_brew_with_my_local_brewery_and_they_put_my/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "TIL that if you did not brew beer in the viking age, you could lose your farm and be exiled!", "selftext": "Source: [The earliest Norwegian laws](http://books.google.no/books?id=m4iWmsOrWWwC&printsec=frontcover)\n\nThis law was written down in the older gulathing law . The reason for this law was because of the old tradition of drinking \"jol\" to remembrance and as a ritual drinking offer to the old gods. This was not in accordance to christianity, but all the people of Norway was so accustomed to drinking jol that Olav Trygvasson said/made a law that more or less said \"You shall keep your traditions of brewing beer and drinking it, but you have to bless it in the name of Christ and holy Mary\".\n\nAlso, Jol was celebrated as long as there was beer to drink. After 20 days of celebrating, all the beer had to be consumed and eveything regarding christmas had to leave the house. But some kept the tradition of celebrating as long as there was beer in the house.\n\n\nHere is the transcript from the older gulathing law.\n>\n>\"Hvis det ikke er f\u00e6rdigt til den fastsatte tid, skal man betale 3 \u00f8re til biskoppen, men dog holde gildet, selv om det er senere. Hvis nogen ikke brygger og findes sandskyldig i det, at han sidder s\u00e5ledes i 12 m\u00e5neder uden at iv\u00e6rks\u00e6tte sammenskuds\u00f8l, da skal han b\u00f8de 3 m\u00e6rker til biskoppen for det.\n\n>Endnu en \u00f8lbrygning har vi lovet at g\u00f8re \u2014 bonde og husfrue af lige store m\u00e6ngder \u2014 og signe det p\u00e5 den hellige nat til Kristi og den hellige Marias tak til \u00e5r og fred. Men hvis det ikke bliver gjort s\u00e5ledes, skal der b\u00f8des 3 m\u00e6rker til biskoppen for det. Hvis han sidder s\u00e5ledes i tre vintre, at han ikke iv\u00e6rks\u00e6tter \u00f8lbrygningen \u2014 og findes sandskyldig deri \u2014 og ikke udreder de b\u00f8der, som vi har p\u00e5lagt for vor kristendoms skyld, da har han forbrudt hver en penning af sin ejendom, som skal tilfalde halvt vor konge og halvt biskoppen. Men han skal have mulighed for at g\u00e5 til skrifte og b\u00f8de over for Krist og s\u00e5 forblive i Norge; hvis han ikke vil det, skal han forlade vor konges land.\"\n\nIn english:\n\n>Now the next is this, that we have promised an ale feast, such as men call a \"neighborhood ale\"; [there shall be] ale from one measure of malt for each freeman and another for his wife. And let three householders at the fewest give the ale in common, unless the live so far out among the isles or so high up on the mountainside that they are not able to bring their brewing to the homes of other men ; in such cases they shall brew as much ale singly, Magnus: \"as would be their share\". Olaf \"as all three should\". \n\n>But if a man occupies a farm supporting fewer than 6 cows or [needing] less than six salds of seed grain he shall give the ale feast only if he wishes to do so. Both: \"This ale shall be given before the mass of All Saints at the lates. The ale shall be blessed with thanks to Christ and Saint Mary for peace and a fruitful harvest; **and if one fails to do this at the appointed time, he shall pay a fine of three \"\u00f8re\" to the bishop and shall give his ale even if it [has to] be at a later time. If he fails to do it and if he is accused and convicted of having allowed a twelvemonth (year) to pass without sharing in a neighborhood ale, he shall pay a fine of three marks to the bishop.**\n\n>We have also promised that every husbandman and his wife shall join in an ale feast, all sharing equality, and bless it on Holy Night with thanks to Christ and Saint Mary for peace and a fruitful harvest. **And if this is not done, they shall pay a fine of three marks to the bishop. And if a man allows three winters to pass without giving an ale feast, and he is accused and convicted of this, or [if he fails to heed] the penalties that we have added to our church law, he shall have forfeited his goods to the last penny ; and the king shall have one-half of it, and the bishop one-half. But he has the choice of going to confession and doing penane; [then he may] remain in Norway ; but if he refuses to do this, he shall depart from the king's dominion.**\n\n>", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/2n5pam/til_that_if_you_did_not_brew_beer_in_the_viking/", "created_utc": 1416738975.0, "score": 446, "author": "haagiboy", "num_comments": 39, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/2n5pam/til_that_if_you_did_not_brew_beer_in_the_viking/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to make a keg of your own \"hard seltzer\" to put on tap. 5 gallons for ~$29.", "selftext": "This post is to explain how to make your own corny keg (5 gal) full of \"hard seltzer\". It's crazy easy, and I was shocked to discover it tastes better than White Claw/Truly/etc. And shocked again that it worked in the first place.\n\nIt makes 5 gallons at ~7.5% ABV for a cost of about $29 and around 2-4 days time of waiting. It takes ~20 minutes to \"make\". The reason for the time range is because various factors affect how fast it carbonates (temperature, agitation, etc). I'm eager to hear some feedback on it, and I hope this isn't common knowledge and I'm just telling everyone something they already knew.\n\nMany of you will already have the supplies to do it. I've already gone through 10 gallons with around 40 different people and every single person raved about it, with most preferring it over the cans.\n\nI'm not sure this fits this sub exactly, but I can't think of another sub where the people may appreciate it.\n\nThese steps/recipe can be easily tweaked to your liking, but below are the core steps. I'm no genius in this space, so if you can think of something concerning or to improve, please let me know.\n\n1. Get a cornelius keg, aka \"Corny Keg\". I got [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKZUQIS).\n2. Add 3.5L of vodka. [I use **two** Kirkland](https://imgur.com/DyQlOBN) vodkas from Costco @ $12.99/ea = $26.\n3. Add 32oz of lemon juice. I thought I purchased lime juice, but realized after I did lemon and it tasted amazing. $2.99\n4. Optionally add any other flavorings that will hold up over time. I put in 5 tablespoons of blueberry powder in my 2nd batch. I'd love to hear other ideas though on flavoring.\n5. Fill the rest up with water. I just used tap water, but you can use filtered or whatever.\n5. Carbonate it - hook up to CO2 at around 30-40 PSI.

{"title": "I've been homebrewing for 20 years...", "selftext": "Hello /r/homebrewing!  I've been on Reddit for about a year now, and just now thought to come into this subreddit. \n\nI started homebrewing when I was 16.  My parents knew I liked to pop a cold one after school when I would defrag my 20mb hard drive and reinstall DOS 3.0 every now and then.  They knew I didn't drink beer to get drunk.  I just liked the flavor.  I don't know why: early 1990s in rural southern Mississippi didn't really offer much in terms of interesting beer choices.\n\nWhen I was 16, I decided I wanted to drink better beer \u2013 beer that a guy my age couldn't buy.  Since beer was illegal to me, but yeast wasn't, I drove to Slidell, LA, to the closest homebrew supply store I could find.  My first beer was an American-style ale.  It was familiar, close to what I was drinking at the time but with a stronger flavor profile.  I didn't destroy anything (though I did have a few boil-overs... newbie).  The whole house smelled like malt.  I was hooked.\n\nSo, I was the only kid I knew with five gallons of bubbling beer-to-be in his closet.  In the early days, I didn't have any bottles and couldn't afford them, so I bottled beer in mason jars with the lids closed as tight as I could get them.  It actually worked surprisingly well.  Only when I got to the last dozen or so beers did they get flat.  \n\nMy beer making got me through college.  I was in the Air Force, and I had to hide my carboy during inspections (I also had a dog, also successfully hidden).  I made beer for my wedding, and I made beer when I was dirt poor.  Homebrewing has been with me for a long time.\n\nI started out as extract-only cheap beer kits.  I've sat through a few all-grain brew days with friends.  I've settled on partial mash as my preferred way to brew.  I like the deeper flavor profile of the partial mash, and I can't really tell the difference between my brew and a complicated all-grain brew.  Maybe I have a crap palette.  Who knows.  \n\nMy set-up is EXTREMELY inexpensive and uncomplicated.  I have my brews down to an art.  I usually do them on Sunday morning while reading the paper.  Here's what I do:\n\n* After buying my ingredients at the supply store, I run to Wal-Mart and get one of their 5-gallon jugs of water.  I get home, pop the lid off and pour about 2 gallons in a large stock pot.\n* I get the water up to about 165.  I then plop the grains in, which usually drops the temp by 10 degrees.  I keep the heat on 1 or so, which maintains that temperature pretty well.  I sit and read the paper.\n* After an hour, I toss in the extracts and follow hop schedule.  I sit near the boil and read the paper and monitor for boilovers.\n* I pour the wort back into the 5-gallon jug that I bought from Wal-Mart.  It still has about 3 gallons of clean water still in it.  That typically brings the temperature of the whole thing to about 100 degrees.  I give it a good shake, pitch my yeast, and seal it with a cheap airlock.\n* The carboy goes into the guest bathtub.  Any blowout goes down the drain.  \n* I usually forego a secondary and just rack straight to bottles.  I've never had a bad experience doing it this way.  A few years ago I bought a couple of cases of Grolsch beer, and so I just reuse those swing-top bottles over and again.  \n* The dirty carboy needs cleaning.  But Wal-Mart gives me $6 if I return the empty 5-gallon jug.  So, I just take the dirty carboy back to Wal-Mart and get my $6 back.  I'll let them clean it.\n\nI know my setup is probably pretty gawdy and ridiculous to a lot of you.  But it's what I've come up with over the past 20 years.  I've NEVER had an infected beer.  I've NEVER had a skunked beer.  I've made beers I didn't particularly like.  But I've gotten to where I think I can change enough variables with partial mash that all-grain doesn't really appeal to me.\n\nRight now, I have a [hefeweizen brewing in my bathtub](http://imgur.com/TLHD2KR).  I added some sweet orange peel halfway through the brew, reduced the bittering hops by half and tossed it in at 15 minutes instead of 30.  The aroma hops also got halved.  (I'm not much of a hop head.  They give me headaches.)  I added more sweet orange peel at the end of the boil as well.  \n\nOne thing I am having fun experimenting with is temperature control.  I turned the heat off in this room, so it's staying about 60-62 in the guest bathroom.  It's been bubbling for almost two weeks now!  It's a very slow fermentation -- the longest primary I've ever done.  I'm thinking I'll definitely have to rack this to a secondary just to make sure everything's been fermenting.  I would sure hate for spring to come and deliver me bottle bombs.\n\nAnyway, that's my story.  If you're ever in the Asheville, NC, area, come by and I'll give you some bathtub beer.  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1w1cc8/ive_been_homebrewing_for_20_years/", "created_utc": 1390577224.0, "score": 431, "author": "germanywx", "num_comments": 182, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1w1cc8/ive_been_homebrewing_for_20_years/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Ten Commandments for Anyone Wanting to Start a Commercial Brewery (based on my own humble observations in the industry)", "selftext": "I\u2019ve worked for a few years on the business side of craft beer, working between dozens of breweries, brew pubs, suppliers, distributors, and retailers. After a while, you begin to see the same mistakes over and over...to the point where I started to note some of the more-common ones, and I\u2019ve narrowed those down to the ten that I feel are most critical to success (or make it all the more difficult). While it is indeed a great talent to be able to create great and memorable beer, that does not equate into a great brewery that sells it\u2019s beer as a successful business (and vice versa). \n\nAgain, these are just my opinions and my advice. I\u2019ve purposely avoided naming specific breweries and details to help convey more of a \u2018guideline\u2019.  There are obviously exceptions to every one of these, so I welcome feedback!\n\n1. Keep pricing in-line and uniform\nHaving a close-but-different price point for your lager, your wheat, your IPA, and your saison will make it more difficult for anyone to sell to a retailer/account, and make it more difficult for them to give shelf space or taps for your beer. Keeping them priced the same will keep their margins the same, and ultimately that is what longer term sales decisions will be based on. If you make a little less on one beer and a little more on another, that should even out, and it\u2019s something that can be revisited later.\n\n2. Same beer types = boring. \nCold hard truth time: nobody cares about your 20 slightly-different IPAs. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s true. Go \u2018seasonal\u2019 or \u2018limited\u2019 with these instead. \n\n3. Keep core brands small and few.\nA brewery I worked with on the east coast kept adding more and more beers to their \u2018core\u2019 lineup. I think at one time they had thirteen \u2018core\u2019 products. This ate up most of the taps they had in their brewpubs, and their sales fell flat after the initial two-three month\u2019s of introducing new beers to the market. They saw their overhead increase (having to make more smaller batches of different product), the beer they were putting out was not always as fresh as before, and their overall sales (case-equivalents) had a slightly lower growth than it did when they had five beers in their \u2018core\u2019.\n\n4. Seasonal package = reuse UPC/registration.\nIf you are canning/bottling, then hurray! Way to go! Also, registering UPCs is not fun, and keeping records of inventory/sales while adding a new UPC every other month is even less fun. Making your beer easier to manage and sell is very fun.\n\n5. Bombers = very limited only!\nI feel that 22oz/750ml bottles hit a peak a few years back alongside the craft explosion, no doubt because so many limited releases were in bombers. What followed was a flood of bombers for every beer, and they aren\u2019t moving nearly as well as they did. Keep them for special releases and save them for a worthy beer.\n\n6. If you can\u2019t do something great, get someone who can and pay them well.\nOh boy...this is the one that kills me. It\u2019s your brewery, it\u2019s your baby, I get that. I really do...but as soon as you are in a position where you can hand over accounting, payroll, legal, HR, sales, marketing, etc. to someone who can concentrate on that, the better your baby will be. Also, don\u2019t just hire friends/family to fill spots if they aren\u2019t totally qualified. Having your cousin do sales because he\u2019s a nice guy is the same as hiring him as a lawyer because he watched a lot of Judge Judy.\n\n7. Stay local (small) or go very big. No middle ground is safe.\nLots of exceptions to this one, but there seems to be a plateau that nearly all breweries hit where sales growth tapers or even drops a bit. You could double-down here, push everything towards growing your brand, knowing that you\u2019ll be running in the red for a few years but that will payoff when things pick up....but from what I have seen, it is rare for that turnaround to happen. I like to think of it as a sort of natural balance.\n\n8. Branding is important. Anything \u2018trendy\u2019 should never be expected to last.\nFor every person who buys your beer because of the novelty (either the beer name or brand name) there is someone who will avoid buying it for the same reason, and once it\u2019s been bought, it\u2019s not very novel anymore.\n\n9. Find community. Find areas outside your industry to participate and be included in.\nThis is huge. Finally something truly positive on this list! From a business standpoint, working with local clubs/charities/events/commerce groups is the best way to build your brand and tie you in with the community...beer is a social drink! From a non-business standpoint, it\u2019s just a great thing to do.\n\n10. Keep branding and packaging uniform. Update one, update all.\nYou\u2019ve got a great idea for a brand? Awesome! Cool looking logo? Fantastic! Now try to make everything else fit with those! The goal is to sell your entire brand with each beer, and that means making the entire experience, the whole concept, uniform. If you name all your beers after exotic sea mammals then start pushing IPAs names after battles in the Crimean War, it\u2019s going to be jarring. If you are sick of dolphins and whales and really feel old battlefields are the thing, don\u2019t be afraid to rebrand or even spin that off as a different brand. It\u2019s not as difficult as you\u2019d think.\n\nI know this has been a very long read, so please let me know if you\u2019ve found it helpful, and maybe give me a pint on the house when you do get that brewery up and running smoothly.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/aacm5e/ten_commandments_for_anyone_wanting_to_start_a/", "created_utc": 1546020169.0, "score": 383, "author": "CameraObfuscia", "num_comments": 119, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/aacm5e/ten_commandments_for_anyone_wanting_to_start_a/", "html_title": ""}

The community has blossomed into one of the best resources for homebrewing we\u2019ve seen on the internet.

Some of you out there with lost posts know what I\u2019m talking about. Being a moderator has been taxing as we all have day jobs, and a real life to live.\n\nAround the time of the last competition when we were looking for awesome sponsors, we were contacted by a rather larger brewery. This brewery, offered some amazing prizes and some ideas. It appears they have quite the social networking department. At first we declined working with them as of their reputation.\n\nFast forward to now. Giving that we all have lives, and our own beer to brew, the moderators have decided to work with this brewery. We have now associated r/Hombrewing with Budweiser or for you technical folks, InBev. From this day on, we the current mods, will take a back seat to r/Homebrewing and BrewerMod will now handle the day to day. BrewerMod, is from Budweiser\u2019s social network department.\n\nWe believe, with the tools and connections BrewerMod within Budweiser we can take this community to the next level. We are currently set up our next AMA with the assistant brewer of Shock Top from Ft. Collins next Thursday April 11th.

{"title": "Liquid yeast and why it's the bane of my existence as the owner of a small LHBS. An extended reply to another thread.", "selftext": "I was originally going to reply to a comment on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/5m6aqr/anyone_have_access_to_rva_yeast_in_virginia/), but I felt it really needed it's own post.  So here we are.\n\nIn that thread /u/LumberZatch states that he feels the shipping charges from a boutique yeast lab, [RVA Yeast Labs](http://www.rvayeastlabs.com/) in this case, are too high and he is looking for help from another redditor to help him source some.  Let me be clear, I am absolutely fine with this.  I love to help out other homebrewers when I can, and I hope that some is able to help him get the yeast he wants.\n\nI posted a reply on that thread that when you order directly from RVA, or even Wyeast or White Labs for that matter, you will receive your yeast in an insulated box, with cold packs, and it will be shipped two day or overnight.  It is standard practice for a professional yeast lab and I would expect no less.  Unfortunately, all of those things combine to make shipping charges very expensive.\n\nAnother user, /u/hoky315 checked with a local Virginia LHBS that was known to carry RVA's yeast and he received a reply that they no longer do and \"They became too expensive.\"\n\nNow here is where I'd really like to add some context.\n\nI also run a [small LHBS in Virginia](https://southernhillshomebrew.com/) and I have carried RVA's yeast. I love RVA Yeast Labs and the folks that run it. It's not really that the yeast itself is too expensive, there are a lot of behind the scenes things that customers don't necessarily see. \n\nRVA Yeast Labs culture your yeast after you place your order.  That means two things:\n\n \n* You're receiving the freshest yeast possible\n\n* There is a two week delay from the time you place your order until the time you receive it.\n\nThat first point is great.  In fact, it's pretty fucking awesome.  The second point sucks.  It means you have to plan ahead.  The problem with that is that your customers don't necessarily plan ahead too.  They walk in to the store with their recipe and expect to have product available.  We all know the disappointment that comes from having to alter a recipe you've been planning because your store is out of something and you have to make a substitution.\n\nWhen I opened my store I stocked every strain available from Wyeast and White Labs, and later on I started stocking some RVA yeast, as well.  Guess what?  A lot of that yeast went unsold. I try to sell some of that out of date yeast at a loss, but a bunch still goes unsold.  That's where the idea for my Frankenyeast came from.  Lemonade out of lemons.\n\nSo why is it so hard for small shops to carry a big selection of liquid yeast?\n\nFirst, shipping.  I'm on the East Coast.  Guess where White Labs and Wyeast are located.  That's right, on the West Coast.  So in order to make it economical to place an order directly from the yeast labs I have to place huge orders. That's because the yeast labs are shipping a big heavy box from one side of the country to the other in two days. If I don't place a big order then shipping costs can eat up all of your profit. I just checked and on the last order I placed with Wyeast the shipping cost was $119 for 90 packs of yeast.\n\nSecondly, shelf life. If you order too much because you're trying to save on shipping, then you're just going to throw away a bunch of out of date yeasts because liquid yeast has a short shelf life. Wyeast and White Labs' new packaging is typically a 6 month shelf life, but some of White Labs stuff is still coming in the old vials (primarily yeast blends and bugs) and the shelf life may only be 3 or 4 months.  RVA and some of the other boutique yeast labs set their shelf life at 3 months.  In fact, I was recently reached out to by another boutique lab located on the West Coast to carry their products.  Unfortunately, shipping costs and shelf life again made my decision for me.\n\nRVA, which is \"local\" to me (about three hours east of me) still has to send out their product in a professional manner, which means in an insulated box, with cold packs and overnight/two day shipping.  I sell Wyeast and White Labs at $8.99 a pack and I was selling RVA for $12.99/each. It seems like RVA is really expensive when you compare it like that, but RVA says that each if their vials has 200B cells, whereas we all assume (because they won't tell us) that White Labs and Wyeast have 100B cells. So on a per vial basis RVA is more expensive but on per cell basis, they are cheaper.\n\nSo it's not that the liquid yeast itself is too expensive.  It's everything else associated with it.\n\nMeanwhile, I can buy Fermentis or Lallemande dry yeast which have a two year shelf life and shipping is factored in with the rest of the stuff that I buy that comes in on a pallet (and the freight charge on that pallet is usually cheaper than the shipping from Wyeast).\n\nI still stock Wyeast and White Labs, though I've greatly pared down the selection that I have.  And I will still order from RVA when a customer requests it, but I don't stock them all the time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/5m8780/liquid_yeast_and_why_its_the_bane_of_my_existence/", "created_utc": 1483641996.0, "score": 357, "author": "thatfatbastard", "num_comments": 197, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/5m8780/liquid_yeast_and_why_its_the_bane_of_my_existence/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Uncle died and I found an incredibly complicated brewing rig going through the garage. Can anyone help me understand how it works?", "selftext": "My uncle was an avid homebrewer for several years and during that time built this massive contraption, that as far as I understand, was supposed to automate his brewing. In an effort to understand this set up, I read through Palmer's How to Brew, but for the most part I am still at a loss on how this rig is supposed to function.    \nI have figured out that:    \nThis rig is for all grain brewing. The two black cylinders are pumps designed to move the wort from the mash to the boil (and to pump sparge water). The keg containing the copper tubing is supposed to be used for the boil whereas the one with the metal mesh at the bottom is intended for mashing. Please correct me if any of this is incorrect.    \nHere is what I do not understand:    \nWhat is the purpose of the keg containing the orange and blue coil? There is no burner underneath it so it cannot be used for heating sparge water, correct?    \nWhat is the proper way to order these kegs? Where I have placed them in the photo is only my best guess.    \nThe grey control hub has many outlets and labels whose purpose I do not understand. What might the ignition be and what might the relay switches be?    \nIs the control hub even necessary beyond for powering the pumps and boilers?    \nWhat volume could I ideally brew with this?    \nIn general, I need help and just feel totally lost. Thank you for your time!    \n\nHere is the album of photos of the rig and associated parts: https://imgur.com/a/LhUCedY .

{"title": "\"Impeachable\" NEIPA recipe.", "selftext": "On this historic day I wanted to share the full recipe and method for my \"Impeachable\" NEIPA.\n\nThis is by far the best NEIPA I have made, nice light colour, very smooth and juicy, fully and completely hazy. \n\nI will admit to using the \"cheat-mode\" combination of hops, Mosaic and Citra, but it is a genuinely perfect fit for the style. \n\nThe use of Vermont Ale yeast imparts wonderful peach notes as well, and this really brings the brew together. I've had some success with \"grassier\" hops in other NEIPAs, such as Galaxy or Vic Secret, and it works well, and can add some balance, but I can't lie - I'm after the full juice effect. \n\nThat said, I don't put juice into beers, so it's all got to come from the hops and yeast. There are a LOT of hops go into this brew - this is the drink that taught me first hand about hop burn. (It does fade, but you don't want to drink it the week after kegging). \n\nAlso a surprise for some is the use of table sugar. In such a high quality and frankly expensive batch that can raise eyebrows, but I just say suspend your judgement and try it.\n\nI first made this in Summer 2018, and posted my beer menu that included it here well over a year ago ( https://old.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/98gbof/the_beer_menu_it_worked_for_me/ ) . \n\nIf you'll allow me a moment to gloat on my prescience, my two tap beers on that menu were *\"Impeachable\" & \"Quid Pro Quo\"*. \n\nHere's the label for the beer: \nhttps://i.imgur.com/Sn3F2C3.jpg\n\nThe label is very simple but I was always proud of the fact that it could be read three ways, as \"Impeachable\", as \"I'm Peach Ale\", or vertically as IPA. :D\n\nWithout further ado here's the grain bill: \n\n4Kg / 8.8 lb Pilsner Malt\n\n1Kg / 2.2 lb Malted Oats\n\n1Kg / 2.2 lb Flaked Wheat\n\n750g/ 1.6 lb Table Sugar\n\nOther additions: Calcium Chloride\n\nHops are Mosaic and Citra\n\nAnd for the Yeast:\nVermont Ale Yeast, by the Yeast Bay (WLP4000)\n\n**Mash**\n\nWe're aiming for ~19l / 5US gallon of wort in the FV. Adjust your Mash / Sparge volumes depending on your devices, to deliver approx 22-24l at boil (5.8-6.3 US gallon), again depending on your setup.\n \nMash for 50 minutes at 65c / 149f\n\nMash out for 10 minutes at 75c / 167f\n\n**Boil** \n\nIn terms of hop additions, we have: \n\n30g / 1 Oz Mosaic at start of boil (60 mins) \nNote: I'm assuming Alpha Acids of about 13% for Mosaic. You can vary the bittering hops quantity with that in mind.\n\nYou do want to add 2 teaspoons of Calcium Chloride during the boil. This will make the beer \"slippy\" and increase your perception of juiciness.\n\nHowever, apart from that *there are NO late additions during boil*. \n\n**Whirlpool**\n\nWe are now about extracting juicy profile from these hops, and as little additional bitterness as possible. \n\nTherefore we WHIRLPOOL the late hops. (i.e. we drop temperature in kettle to around 70c / 158f) \n\nThen add:\n\n100g / 3.5 Oz Mosaic, \n\n100g / 3.5 Oz Citra. \n\n(YES 100g / 3.5 Oz each.) Spend about 30 mins whirlpooling, then chill to FV temperature.\n\n**Ferment / Dry Hop**\n\nMy recommendation is to go low on the chill - bring it down to 16c / 60f before pitching the yeast. Make it struggle a bit out of the gate, to enhance the peach esters. \n\nFinally, dry hop with another 100g / 3.5 Oz Mosaic, and another 100g / 3.5 Oz Citra. \n\nDry hop on 3rd or 4th day of fermentation. Don't be afraid to use muslin bags to keep some of the heavier matter restricted, it won't hurt the haze or profile and may prevent blockages in your FV or keg setup. This is hop city. \n\n**Keg**\n\nKeg after 10 days. It will need 3 weeks in the Keg before the sheer hoppage will stop burning the back of your throat when you sample it. But it will taste good enough within a week, that you'll probably burn your throat a few times anyway. \n\nAnd here's what it looks like in the glass: \nhttps://i.imgur.com/alnCXZN.jpg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/ecci7p/impeachable_neipa_recipe/", "created_utc": 1576675118.0, "score": 332, "author": "wild_quinine", "num_comments": 140, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/ecci7p/impeachable_neipa_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I am a professional brewer - AMA!", "selftext": "Hello r/homebrewing! I have been following this sub since before I ever brewed my first beer at home. Now, many years and many beers later, brewing pays my bills. I posted yesterday to see if there was any interest and that was quickly confirmed, so let's do this!\n\nBackground info: I homebrewed through college while studying Environmental Science and International Studies. Upon graduating, I was not finding many leads on interesting jobs in my fields of study, so I continued to work at the coffee shop I had been at for a few years. A regular customer of mine mentioned that he knew a guy opening a brewery. I asked for his card and sent him a cold email saying that I wanted to work for him and would do whatever he needed. He interviewed me a few months later and gave me a packaging technician job. I spent the first 9 months building/dialing in our packaging lines, stacking cases, and filling kegs. 3 years later (and an array for formal brewing education), I have moved from Packaging Tech to Assistant Brewer to Brewer to Senior Brewer - and I'm now transitioning into a brewhouse manager position. \n\nI operate a 50 barrel automated brewhouse with a mix of 50 to 200bbl fermenters (23 in total), and we're hoping to push 40,000bbls this year.  This would make us the ~5th biggest brewery in our state - which has been a wild ride for such a short period of time. We were also included in the BA's 2018 Top 50 Fastest Growing Breweries. Most of our production are contracted beers from local and a few out of state breweries. The rest is comprised of our house brand - traditional German styles. Altogether, I\u2019ve brewed about 60 different SKUs, comprised of ales, lagers, NEIPAs, beers with 600lbs of honey, overly fruited ridiculousness, and 10 or more yeast strains. \n\nI'd love to field any questions you guys might have about homebrewing, production brewing, the state of the industry, ingredients, etc. Please note that I am not an owner and I do not handle the finances (thankfully). I can speak a little bit to what things cost, how we prioritize finances, expansion, etc., but anything regarding investments, loans, and overall profitability will be more difficult for me to answer.\n\nI asked for some starter questions in my previous post, so hopefully those people see this thread and can copy them over to here. Otherwise, I'll try to look back and answer them here for everyone. It may take me a while to get through all the questions (I do still have to do my job), so please be patient. I'll leave this thread up indefinitely and keep answering for as long as you guys keep reading and asking. \n\n[Prost!](https://imgur.com/a/rxCHB2k)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/cgfgin/i_am_a_professional_brewer_ama/", "created_utc": 1563813175.0, "score": 327, "author": "ironicirenic", "num_comments": 284, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/cgfgin/i_am_a_professional_brewer_ama/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to brew a better IPA. My homebrewing quest for the \"hop burps\"", "selftext": "IPA's and pale ales are my favorite styles of beer.  In 3 years of brewing, over half of my brews have been in these categories.  Luckily, my wife feels the same about the style and actually demands either a pale ale or IPA be on tap at all time.  I know, it's a rough life.  We frequent local breweries and festivals to sample a variety of beers, but I am constantly comparing my IPA's to the ones I purchase.  I am usually disappointed that mine tend to fall just short of majority of these.  Perhaps I am too critical of my own work, but nothing I made seemed to be on par.  \n\n\nTo further describe what I mean by my beers falling short of \"the mark\", think of your favorite \"commercial\" IPA.  Personally, I love West coast IPA's.  Even though I am on the East coast, they are readily available.  Foothill's Hoppyium and Jade IPA, Olde Hickory's Death by Hops, Wicked Weed's Freak of Nature, and Triple C's 3C IPA are some of my favorite.  When you drink one of these beers, you are launched on a hop roller coaster from start to finish.  The aroma is apparent immediately, a face full of hop flavor after the first sip, smooth bitterness on the back of your tongue.  Even once you swallow the beer, your mouth is coated with the pleasant lingering of hop flavor.  Even still, when you burp as you often do drinking beer, you may experience another blast of flavor and aroma from your belch.  You may think I am kidding, but I am not.  I love \"hop burps\".  It is almost refreshing, like your first breath after using mouthwash.  \n\n\nMy beers were certainly IPA's, but nothing like what I just described.  The aroma was there, but was faint.  The bitterness was more astringent.  The flavor was there, but fell off in seconds.  No lingering, no hop burps, just plain.   So how can I brew a beer that is so deliciously packed full of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness that I end up with the \"hop burps\"?  It has not been easy to achieve, but I believe I have crafted beers that could stand up against many of my favorites.   \n\n\nSo, what have I learned as a home brewer to improve making this style?  A lot. Sorry for the wall of text, but here goes nothing.  \n\n\n**1  Hops.**  \nThe cornerstone of any pale ale or IPA.  All different kinds of hops can give totally different bittering, aroma, and flavor characteristics.  We all know this.  We also know some hops are better than others at imparting smooth bitterness or strong aromas.  But it does take time to discover the combinations that you like.  General guidelines I follow:\n\n*  Pick one or two flavor characteristics and stick with it.  (Citrus and floral, piney and spicy, or just citrus/piney are just a few examples.)  Some favorites are Citra and Amarillo, Simcoe and Centennial/cascade, and Columbus and Chinook.  There are obvious exceptions to this rule, but try this out until you get a better idea of what you like.  \n\n*  High alpha acid hops are usually best for bittering.  But don't be afraid to use them to dry hop or impart flavor.  Columbus is one of my favorite hops to dry hop with.  Alternately, low AA hops like cascade can be an excellent choice for a bittering hop for some.\n\n*  First Wort hopping.  I almost always split by bitter addition between FWH and the 60 min mark.  It give a much smoother bittering flavor.  So if you plan on using 1oz for bittering, try .5 FWH and .5 at 60.  \n\n* HUGE late additions.  Fuck the 45 and 30 min additions.  I use 90% of my hops at 15mins and under.  Usually 10 and under.  In a ten gallon batch I may add 2oz at 15, 2oz at 10, 4oz at 5, and 6oz at flame out.  A lot of brewers are now using a \"no-boil\" method for IPA's, so only FWH and flame out additions.  \n\n* Hop bursting.  As sub section of big late additions, hop bursting is an excellent example of this.  Imagine a 100 IBU beer with only 10-15 ibu's coming from the bittering hop, and the rest coming from the last 15 mins of the boil.  I used 2.2lbs of hops in a 10gal beer using this method.  It was amazing.  \n\n* Hop Stand/ whirl pool/ hop back.  Huge late additions are a total waste of money if you do not let the hops impart their flavor and aroma.  Without getting into the technicalities of these methods, in any set-up you can get the most out of your late additions by just WAITING.  Don't freak out when you stop the boil \"oh my god I am going to get an infection if I don't cool it and transfer it immediately!\"  Give it the occasional stir and just let it sit for 20 mins.  You will thank me later.\n\n* Dry hopping.  Duh.  But how can you get the most out of dry hopping?  Try staggered dry hopping. Even up to 3 different 4 day periods.  Try dry hopping toward the end of fermentation.  The aroma can change by dry hopping a beer that is still fermenting.  I am also a HUGE fan of dry hopping in the keg.  I use nylon bags and just let them float in the keg.  It can give a subtle fresh aroma that can last through the whole keg without imparting off- flavors.  \n\n**2  Grain.**  \nWhile less important than hops, grain cannot be ignored.  Depending on the style of IPA you wish to make, the grain bill will likely vary a lot.  So I will just a few things:\n\n\n* Dude, easy on the caramel/crystal.  An IPA should not taste like a sour patch kid.  Bitterness and a cloyingly sweet finish.  Seriously, 5% or less of the grain.  \"But DrNafario if I do that, my beer won't have any malt flavor or mouthfeel.\" Wrong.\n\n* Which brings me to my next point.  Feel free to use an alternate base grain to add maltiness or mouthfeel.  I find a small percentage of most german base malts are perfect for this.  10-20% of Vienna, Munich or even British Marris Otter will do wonders for the flavor and mouthfeel without masking hop flavor with sweetness.  \n\n* Dextrine malt.  Adding 2-4% of carapils goes a LONG way.  Head retention is a big deal in a hop-forward beer.  Bubbles burst and release the wonderful aromas that may otherwise be trapped in your beer.  \n\n* Do NOT use random recipes to create an IPA of that style.  Just because you brewed an awesome red ale, does not mean the same grain bill will work for a red IPA.  A good stout does not make a good black IPA, etc.  This goes back to the first point.  Sweeter ales usually do not blend will with hop forward beers.   \n\n\n**3 Yeast.**  \nCalifornia I Ale yeast.  Seriously.  It is a no brainer for any IPA style.  It is very clean and will accentuate the hops.  Tired of Cal I?  Try any other high attenuating, dry, clean yeast.  Pacific Coast, Headwaters, Cal V, English, British, San Diego, and East coast are some good choices.  However, some of these will give off more fruity esters which I find distracting.  In sumation, Cal I.  \n\n\n**4  Water.**  \nI was very resistant to diving into water chemistry.  Pun aside, every time I read about it I just wanted to go chug a beer.  Finally with the help of a fellow home brewer, I adjusted the water on a simple brown ale.  Wow.  It really does make a difference.  I will just scratch the surface of this topic for the purpose of this style.\n\n\n* Sulfates aid your beer in retaining hop character.  For me this was the missing link.  Gypsum is dirt cheap and it only takes a little to get huge results.  \n\n* $25 bucks will get you a brewing water test for a baseline, or look it up online for your area. Worst case, ~~assume you have distilled water as a baseline~~ build your water from purchased distilled water.  \n\n* Look up some hoppy beer water profiles, use your base line, and add enough Gypsum to get to about 200ppm of sulfates.  CaCl will also help by boosting calcium content.  \n\n\nDon't believe me?  Ask Vinnie Cilurzo from Russian River, brewer of Pliny the Elder:\n\n\"Adding sulfate via gypsum in both your mash and boil is a great way to get more hop character out of your beer. The calcium also aids in a healthy mash and in yeast flocculation. This can be beneficial for dry hopping, since you can achieve less yeast in the beer while the dry hops are in contact with your beer.\"\n\n\n**5  In general.**  \nNo one thing will suddenly make your beer great.  Just like brewing in general, it is the culmination of everything.  \n\n\n* Don't let IBU calculations stop you.  A range of things like contact time, temperature, and boil gravity have an impact of the utilization of a hop.  It may tell you this beer is going to be 110 Ibu's, but really it ends up being more like 60.  Experiment with how your own perceived bitterness compares to the calculated and adjust accordingly.  I just brewed a beer rated at 220IBU, but tastes more like 90.  \n\n*  Don't stress about the \"style\" or category it fits into.  \"Is this a pale ale? IPA? Double IPA? or Imperial IPA?\"  Well shit I have 46Ibu's so I guess I am in the IPA category, but it only has 4.9% ABV\u2026 It's your beer call it what you want.  Even if you are submitting it for judging, do you really think they can tell if it has 40 vs 60 IBU? What does it taste like to you? \n\n*  As with all beer, control your fermentation temps.  Esters are sometimes desired in IPA's, but the smell and taste of banana's are not.\n  \n*  Use whirlflock tabs or irish moss to help with the break.  If you IPA tastes good, better make it look good too.  \n\n* Buy hops in bulk.  Save yourself some money.  Seal them up and freeze them in between brew sessions.  When you have accumulated a bunch of left overs, combine them all in to super awesome crazy IPA.  \n\n* Use a hop spider.  It is just easier and cleaner.  Wont clog pumps or siphons and will keep the trub to a minimal level.  You can also dunk it up and down during the hop stand for better aroma.  \n\n* Drink it fresh! but not too early.  IPA's benefit from a good cold conditioning.  \n\n* ENJOY YOUR WORK! and don't be so self critical, it is more fun that way.  \n\n\n\nHopefully this is helpful to some of the newer brewers, and maybe even some of the advanced brewers.  These are just the things I have picked up on the way in trying to brew the best IPA's I can.  I would love to provide some input for your recipes and will be glad to share some of mine.

{"title": "I brewed a beer using only a young sourdough starter I created in my kitchen. Here\u2019s how it turned out!", "selftext": "Several months ago I made a post in this sub asking for advice. I got a range of \u201cjust do it like normal\u201d bits of advice, some folks warning me against it, and other bits telling me what to be careful about. \n\nSince this was a full-on experiment, I decided to just throw caution to the wind and treat it like any other beer. \n\nThe beer I chose was a Gose, one of the oldest still-produced beer. It was brewed before yeast was even really understood. So, commercial yeast definitely wasn\u2019t a thing. I figured this style would be really appropriate for yeast I captured in my kitchen. \n\nI was hoping for a mild lactic acid sourness along with the saltiness of the beer. Something really unique to my region\u2019s yeast. \n\nTwenty-four hours before brewing, I sanitized an old pickle jar with Starsan.  I got some LME dissolved in warm water, added about 8 ounces of my starter, then vigorously shook it up. I put a lid on it, put a metal bowl upside down on the lid (in case it got too active and blew out the jar), and left it in my sink overnight. \n\nOn brew day, the yeast starter was churning along quite nicely! It definitely smelled bready. \n\nI brewed my Gose. Added the salt and coriander. I got a starting gravity of 1.050.\n\nI pitched my yeast, hoping for the best. \n\nI had anticipated a long time for the wild yeast to kick into high gear, but 12 hours later and it was already pushing through the airlock. \n\nI bent down to smell, half expecting it to smell like an armpit or a port-o-john. I was pleasantly greeted to the smell of fresh baked bran muffins with orange peel. I hadn\u2019t used any orange in my Gose, so this was exciting!\n\nIt finished bubbling and cleared up within about 6 days. I let it sit for about 10 more days in case some of the yeast were slow acting. I took a gravity reading: 1.012. Four more days later, another reading. Same result. \n\nI added pruning sugar and bottled and let it condition for 10 days before I couldn\u2019t stand it. I chilled it down and poured a glass. \n\nIt tastes no different than a Gose made with commercial yeast!\n\nNow, while this is good news, I admit I\u2019m a little disappointed with the result. I was hoping for more sourness. The lactic acid is basically nonexistent. It\u2019s missing the distinct sourness I was really looking forward to. \n\n**Takeaways**\n\nI\u2019ve been homebrewing for about 25 years. Never once have I had an infection. I figured, if I were to ever get one, it would be in this beer. \n\nDidn\u2019t happen. \n\nBasically nothing that I expected to happen did. It acted absolutely no different than a commercial yeast. I did nothing different than a regular brew. \n\nIf you want to try it, don\u2019t get intimidated. Just do it. I took no special precautions. I got a delicious (if not unique) beer out of it. \n\n[Here are just a few pics of my process.)](https://imgur.com/gallery/VjPYFrK)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/gqj4kq/i_brewed_a_beer_using_only_a_young_sourdough/", "created_utc": 1590440030.0, "score": 320, "author": "ilikemrrogers", "num_comments": 60, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/gqj4kq/i_brewed_a_beer_using_only_a_young_sourdough/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Japan's arcane laws will require me to add fruit etc. to my (future) brews. Any ideas to minimize their impact on beer flavor/quality?", "selftext": "****EDIT: I want to thank so many people for their suggestions, but before posting I would kindly ask you check the linked list below that lists exactly which fruits I can use. Watermelons, cucumbers, grains, and other things not in their official \"Fruits\" category don't count to the 5% additive minimum. I agree it makes no sense, but I have to work within those restrictions.****\n\nWhat fruit adjunct provides the LEAST flavor contribution and minimally affects a beer's properties? Why would you want to add fruit to a brew when its presence is not desired? Read on to find out why I am interested in this question.\n\nI have been a lover of beer almost my entire life, and now I am looking to start a career in beer, specifically in opening a brewpub. Now you may think you have heard this story a million times but I have a couple twists to add and would like to crowdsource some ideas for the beers I am going to brew.\n\nI live in Japan and want to open a brewery in Japan. Without getting into too much detail, there are a ton of antiquated regulations in Japan regarding what does and does not constitute beer, somewhat similar to the Reinheitsgebot (German Beer Purity Law) that limits beer to the ingredients of water, malt, hops, and yeast. \n\nIf I can't produce 60,000 liters a year (512 bbl) to qualify for the beer license, I can only apply for a license to brew \"near-beer\" called Happoshu which has a yearly minimum of 6,000 liters (51 bbl), which is much more reasonable. But my planning has hit a huge setback.\n\nStarting from next year (which is when I would receive my license), the Happoshu license rules are being revised. Previously, you could add just a couple grams of an additive (such as orange peel or coffee) to a batch of beer and it became Happoshu, no problem. Many craft brewers in Japan make Happoshu that taste just as good as standard craft beer, and have found success doing so. But starting next year, the amount of additives required is being raised to \"5% of the total weight of malt used\". \n\nThis means if I want to open a nanobrewery in Japan below 60,000 L yearly capacity, I am going to have to get creative with my recipes. (Luckily for craft brewers currently working in Japan, they are grandfathered in and are not effected by these new laws)\n\nSo here is my question. Given the following conditions, what additives or combination of additives would provide the LEAST flavor contribution and affect the qualities of the brew the least? While a beer made with 5% grapefruit or apple juice could definitely work, I am more concerned with replicating typical, classic styles without any fruity/nutty flavors or impacted clarity, color, fermentation, head retention, etc.\n\nConditions: \n-Recipe with 5.1 kg additives for every 100 kg of malt. (Hops counted separate).\n\n-Additive must be added before the boil (in mash or post-mashing is OK). If mashed, it has to be mashed for extraction - Even slight/poor conversion is OK. Then the remainder can stay in the mash tun with spent grain. If boiled, the boil time has to be enough to pasteurize the addition, and boiled matter has to go into the fermenter and through the fermentation process (separating out after is OK)\n\n-Additive must be in the category listed as \"Fruits\" as defined by the Japanese government.\nLink to official list of \"fruits\":\n\n[http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000294475.pdf](http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000294475.pdf)\n\nSee page 511, category 69-8, ending on page 513, category 69-89\n\nSome notable items: strawberries and melons are omitted, and some nuts are included.\n\n-The additive may be used whole, dried, concentrated, ground up, or boiled down before use, but juices or extracts cannot be diluted with water beyond natural concentrations before addition.\n\n-Any combination can be used as long as the total amount of additive exceeds 5%.\n\n-Spices used commonly for beer (coriander, etc.) are allowed as well, but I don't think 5% of any spice by weight can be hidden.\n\nI've tried to imagine what could be done given these conditions. My first inclination is to use acorns or chestnuts in the mash, and just use them for additional conversion since they have some starches, but I'm concerned about getting a nutty taste. I'm hoping for something novel or weird to cleverly circumvent their rather arbitrary restrictions, anything you guys can come up with? Was there any time you tried to add a fruit and no flavor came through? Or can two additions cancel each other out? Or some other knowledge that could point me in the right direction? I'm just curious if there is any workaround to this before settling on apple ale, grapefruit IPA, nut brown ale, and so on, or dig deeper and try to find some resources (investors) to qualify for a bigger outlay for a beer license. Please share any thoughts or ideas you may have! Cheers!\n\nEDIT: I've realized that while the malt/additive ratio has to be 100:5, I can add other non-malt adjuncts as long as I have a 50% or higher malt bill. So if I added unmalted barley, rice, corn, etc. to a point where it's, for example 75/25 malt/grain adjuncts, then I can lower the amount of fruit additives by 25%. It would be a hell of a frankenstein brew at that point and its hard to imagine its keeping a beery profile, but its possible and worth considering for this exercise.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/6bgiuc/japans_arcane_laws_will_require_me_to_add_fruit/", "created_utc": 1494928294.0, "score": 310, "author": "ZeimushoYaro", "num_comments": 244, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/6bgiuc/japans_arcane_laws_will_require_me_to_add_fruit/", "html_title": ""}

One of the guys that works there collects waste beer in a 16L jug. He then takes it home and distills 4L at a time, down to 500ml. That first run comes out at around 20%. He does this until he has 16L collected of first running. \nThen he distills it all down again, to around 37.5%.\n\nSomehow it keeps certain flavor compounds from the beer. So depending on which beer he distills, the beershine ends up with different flavors. The last batch he made was with our IPA. It is both weird and really interesting having a beer turned into a hard liquor. He gave me a half liter to try, and I'm not 100% sure whether to just sip it on the rocks, or make mixed drinks.\nTo be clear, the waste beer is from things like cans where the lids don't seal.

I malted and roasted the barley myself resulting in 10lbs pale malt, 15lbs crystal malt (dutch oven method),  4lbs chocolate malt (popcorn popper method).\n\n[Malting Barley](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4e1hS1F29g/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)\n\nI really wanted to make at least one 5 gallon batch made exclusively from produce of my farm \u2013 a vertically integrated craft brew.

Tis the season for pumpkin spice everything, after all.\n\n\nWhite Girl Wasted\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nGrain:\n\n* 12.5# - 2-Row\n* 2.0# - Flaked Barley\n* 1.5# - Pale Chocolate\n* 0.5# - Roasted Barley\n* 0.5# - Midnight Wheat\n\nHops:\n\n* 0.8oz - Magnum (60min)\n* 1.0oz - Golding (30min)\n\nExtras:\n\n* 1.0# - Lactose (10min)\n* 2tsp - Pumpkin Spice (1min)\n* 2 - Fresh Madagascar Vanilla Beans (7 days)\n* 8oz - Medium Roast Coffee Beans (Cold Brew, Add at Bottling)\n\nUsed San Diego Super Yeast, but any clean yeast would do. Vanilla beans were cut up and soaked in vodka for 1 week before dumping the whole thing in the bucket. Coffee was coarsely ground and cold brewed, then added at bottling to taste. Also, you notice that I didn't add pumpkin to this...I don't feel that pumpkin contributes positively to a beer. Blasphemy, I know, but don't let my preferences stop you from adding it if you choose to give this a try.\n\nMy impressions:\nExactly what I was looking for. This thing just tastes like a cool Christmas morning. The vanilla and pumpkin spice compliment each other really well...I'm surprised I haven't seen any commercial examples using this combo yet...and the coffee brings it all together. I don't have the palate to tell you about all the subtleties going on here, but on a scale of \"Not Good\" to \"Good\", I'd give this a \"Good\".\n\nWhat I'd like to do different next time:\n--I was concerned with how powerful the coffee taste would be when competing with the spice and vanilla, so I decided to cold brew it and add at bottling to taste. Not a necessary step, next time I will steep the beans for 4 or so days in the beer directly.\n--Add a little more pumpkin spice. It's subtle right now, and I'd like it to be a bit more obvious\n--Split batch with and without coffee. Tasting at bottling convinced me that the vanilla and pumpkin spice combo alone deserves to be highlighted. I'd like to use this combo in more recipes as well...it's that good.\n\nIf this concept interests you enough to dedicate a brew day to it, let me know.

Between finding a bunch of info both credible and not so credible and also talking with the vet I wanted to give you guys a rundown of what I found out about hop-doggycide.\n\n\n* ingesting hops can trigger malignant hyperthermia in some breeds, especially greyhounds and bulldogs -- although it isn't really *toxic* it just activates the condition.  \n\n* the two main timeframes to be aware of if your dog eats hops: under 10 minutes you can induce vomiting with hydrogen peroxide but dogs are quick digesters so after 10 minutes it's in there. 3-6 hours after eating is the critical time to watch for signs of hyperthermia. If after 8-10 hours nothing is wrong the dog is most likely safe.  \n\n* symptoms of hyperthermia: sets in very quick once it starts! excessive panting; temperature increase of 104+ going up by a degree or two every five minutes: over 108 is a death sentence; hyperactivity combined with muscle stiffness.  \n\n* most of the info on the interwebs about hopsecuting your dog comes from a limited study done 15 years ago - fact is there just isn't a lot of empirical evidence yet but enough people have lost their pets to hops that it's worth being careful.  \n\n* there's a lot of conflicting info out there so be careful. ie: some say pellets are fine but leaf is bad(my vet called bs on this); spent brewed hops are not as harmful as raw(vet said could be true but most dogs leave raw alone and go after wort soaked for the flavor).  \n\n* if you compost your hops, this is where a lot of dogs get access to them.  \n\n* if you have this happen and want to dig up info on the net, pet websites tend to have rehashed versions of the same story about 8 greyhounds in Illinois - better off checking homebrew forums. This is where the 'real-life' experiences are being posted.  \n\nIt's been 12 hours now since 'the incident' and my beer is bubbling and my dog seems fine.  \n\nTL;DR don't let your dog near your hops", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/g9re1/my_dog_ate_spent_hops_just_got_back_from_vet_want/", "created_utc": 1300894001.0, "score": 299, "author": "hrdchrgr", "num_comments": 62, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/g9re1/my_dog_ate_spent_hops_just_got_back_from_vet_want/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "A Guide to Using Fruit in Beer", "selftext": "I have been alluding to this post for a while, and now that it is officially summer here in Milwaukee and I have the week off it seems good enough time as any to finally write this.\n\n# Why Fruit?\n\nBefore we get into the process, we need to look at recipe design. I know, boring stuff. If you think recipe design is for try hard nerds, please go to the next section and consider subbing at r/prisonhooch.\n\nFruit in beer can be as easy as just tossing raspberries in your wheat or sour and calling it a day, but why raspberries? Why do you see those all over the place and very little watermelon, or peach, or citrus? Well, when you ferment the fruit in beer you change its flavor. Most of what you taste when you eat said fruit is the sugar that it contains, and as you should know your yeast will consume all of that sugar, so your final product won't taste like you eating the piece of fruit while drinking the beer. Because of this we need to know how the fruit tastes once its devoid of sugar and work around that. A process I enjoy doing for this is to make a dry wine made up entirely of that fruit. This gives you the best idea if what you're doing is doomed from the start (like watermelon).\n\nThe list I gave of not as common fruits are for one unifying reason, they are mostly sugar and taste like nothing when fermented. It's the same with why you shouldn't use honey in a beer for flavor, but instead honey malt. Knowing this can save you time when you attempt to make fun of ABI by making that pumpkin peach ale only to realize that you put in 10 lbs of peach puree and all you got is another pumpkin ale, and not even in the proper season.\n\nOther not as common fruits are blueberries and sweet cherries. This group has the same problem that concord grape wine or Manischewitz has, once the sugar is gone from these they taste like medicine.\n\nThe last group of uncommon fruits are the citrus family. Oranges, limes, lemons and even pineapple can do weird things to your brew because of their acidity, and in the special case of pineapple enzymes that kill head retention. The other reason these fruits aren't used is because there are two great ways to get the flavor without having to resort to the actual fruit and claim Reinheitsgebot status: there are dozens of hop varieties out there that give these flavors and different yeasts that when stressed can mimic the taste. So why go through the hassle of processing fruit when you can just swap ingredients?\n\n*K\\_Mander, you just gave me a list of fruits not to use. So what should I be using?*\n\nGood question. The best fruits are ones that are not overly sweet and have other flavors that exist beyond sugar. Raspberries are such a common fruit because of their natural tartness, so when their sugar is gone that flavor remains. Tart cherries have a better cherry flavor and don't taste like medicine after being fermented. Likewise, wine grapes aren't all that good for eating, but they ferment nicely. It's the same reason why crab and deer apples make better hard ciders than eating or baking apples. Lastly, apricots are the best way to give you a peach flavor that can withstand fermentation (see, alternate ingredients to give you your end goal). But at the end of the day, this hobby thrives on experimentation and you learn more from your failures than you do successes.\n\n**Takeaways from this chapter:**\n\n* Fruit after it's fermented doesn't taste the same as just eating it\n* See if there are alternate ingredients that you can use to mimic the flavor\n* The best fruits are ones with strong flavors that don't rely all on their sugar (raspberries, apricots, and other tart varieties)\n* Take risks!\n\n# Sourcing Your Fruit\n\nSo you've read my warning and are going to use fruit anyways. Good for you! Trying new things is always fun even when it doesn't work out. But where do we get the fruit? Simple answer is anywhere.\n\nFresh is always the best, but it can be pricey. If you have any pick your own orchards near by you can easily get a haul for cheap, but you pay for it in labor. I've also gone to asking vendors at farmers markets if they have bruised and questionable buckets that they'd sell for half off. Let them know you're brewing with it and slip them some product after its done and they'll remember you, but only as fondly as the hooch you've made.\n\nFrozen is a great resource because it's cheaper, year round, convenient, and partially processed to make it easier to handle.\n\nCanned fruit is also an option. The largest upside to canned is that it is already pasteurized so you don't need to worry about sanitizing your fruit before adding it. The largest downside is that because of the pasteurization process you will get some different flavors because it is cooked. And please be sure to check to make sure that it is in juice, not heavy syrup.\n\n*I have my fruit... now what?*\n\nWe need to ready it before it goes in the beer. You don't want whole berries just floating in your brew, you won't get any flavor from them.\n\nReadying is simply doing a light wash if you have unprocessed fruit (frozen and canned will have done this already), simply rise it under water and make sure there's no dirt on it. Unless you like that pure earthy quality in your beers.\n\nAfter washing you do a fine chop or puree of your fruit, making sure to remove any gross bits first. Freezing and then thawing can help with this process as it breaks them down at the cellular level.\n\nNext up, YOU HAVE TO SANITIZE YOUR FRUIT!\n\n*Wait, what's up with that all caps portion?*\n\nThank you for noticing that, narration prompt. As with all cold side additions or touches to your beer, you want to be sure that what you have has been thoroughly cleaned in order to not introduce wild bugs that can infect your product. There is also a common misconception on what sterilized actually means. Sterilized is any process in which you have removed the vast majority off all bacteria or other living micro organisms\\*, while sanitized is the same but to a lesser extent\\*. This can be done with heat (pasteurization), a chemical process, or by irradiating it (we will not be talking about this one for practical reasons). *(I don't know how to change this so people don't think mixing their fruit with StarSan is a viable procedure, so I'm leaving it so people DO NOT accidentally think a StarSan rinse is a viable activity. Hate mail bellow)* One thing that is not sterilization is cold, so everyone repeat after me:\n\n# FROZEN IS NOT STERILIZED*!!!!\n\n\\*(or sanitized, or what ever your word choice is)\n\nSome frozen fruit is pasteurized before the freezing process, but not all. This is mostly done with the larger fruit manufacturers as the stuff that's frozen is the planned left overs (or too ripe and won't survive shipping) from the harvest and they all get processed the same way. But even if they claim it's processed, [they might have missed a few bugs](https://imgur.com/ZQR1QNP). Because of this I still encourage you to sterilize your purchased fruit.\n\nYour friendly, local, organic, probably bearded, wearing a \"grow food not grass\" shirt producer at the farmer's market does not pasteurize their product and it will have wild bugs in it that can (not will, yeast tend to make things alcoholic to kill off potential competition) infect your beer. Cluster berries are the worst cause because of all the little grooves in them that you can't wash as well. Downvotes to the left and leave an angry comment about how you've only froze and never had an infection; I'm sure your luck will comfort the ones who did get a wild bug.\n\nThere are three common practices for ~~sterilizing~~ *sanitizing* the fruit: campden tabs, alcohol, and heat. But before we get there, we need to ready the fruit.\n\nHeat is simple where you get the crushed/juiced/whatever fruit to a steady 185 degrees for 30 or so minutes. All the sous vide wands make this process really easy. Do **NOT** boil as it will change your flavor. And if you're just going to boil, why not add it to the boil kettle? This is far from an ideal solution, but it works.\n\nCampden is my preferred method where you mash/juice/chop the fruit (freezing and thawing can make this easier) and add a crushed campden tab per gallon of liquid (this is referred to as must), then leave it out covered with a tea towel for a day or two to let the sulfur dissipate. I like this because it's the same method used for wine and keeps the delicate flavors heat can remove (even if the beer will hide some of those flavors) but it also takes less active time than simmering the solution.\n\nAlcohol is even easier, but more expensive and very easy to overdose. Soak the fruit in any distilled spirit (vodka for no flavor, other items if you want that flavor) for at least an hour, and toss it in. However, a bag of campden tabs is about $6 and you only need 1 tab per gallon of must, so it will last you through 100 gallons of fruit juice. Even Everclear is more expensive than that and less exact.\n\nNow that you have your ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized* fruit you can to add it to the beer.\n\n**Takeaways from this chapter:**\n\n* Frozen is not ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized* and can introduce sour bugs\n* Different sources give you different amounts of control of your product\n* Frozen is not ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized*\n* Quality ingredients drive quality products\n* Frozen is not ~~sterilized~~ *sanitized*\n\n# Adding the Fruit\n\nThere are 4 major ways to introduce fruit into your beer, in order of ease they are: boil, \"secondary\", blending, and keg.\n\n**BOIL**\n\nBoiling the fruit is by far the easiest and safest way of putting fruit in your beer. Not only does it sterilize (or sanitize, depends on how long it is in the boil) the fruit, it fully mixes it in with the wort and adds nothing else to your processes. If using frozen you can even use it as a way to help bring down your temp when trying to cool the beer.\n\nThe problems with this method is that you will lose some of the more delicate aromas of the fruit as they get blown out of the airlock, and because they were boiled you can get a bit of a cooked flavor. You can play with this cooked fruit flavor and have a MO with biscuit and victory for a pie beer. But it's still a workable choice if you just want it one and done or you have limited everything.\n\nHowever, there's a reason no one cooks their fruit in any other fermentation hobby.\n\n**\"SECONDARY\"**\n\nThe most popular way to add fruit is by adding it to your beer after primary fermentation has slowed or stopped. No need to actually transfer the beer to another vessel though, just put the fruit in a muslin bag and set it in your fermenter. It will kick off a secondary fermentation because of the new sugars and run along.\n\n[My process is to pour in your sterilized must into the fermenter through a muslin bag,](https://imgur.com/a/4fV9dNo) tie the bag off, and tie a piece of unflavored, waxed floss to it for when it sinks. The bag will let the liquid in and out just fine while containing the fruit pieces. This way when fermentation is done you can just pull the floss to remove the bag and not worry about clogging your siphon.\n\n**BLENDING**\n\nBlending is the same process used to make a mediocre sour and and undrinkable sour become a lot of mediocre sour. The actual theory is simple: make two things, put them together until it becomes what you want it to be. For fruit beer it means you need to make a dry wine along side your beer with minimal additions (maybe even during the mash, you have the downtime) and when both complete you start playing mad scientist by combining them until it tastes like what you want.\n\nThe obvious downside to this process is that you need to have two fermentations going at once, which means you need twice as much gear. But for everything that makes this difficult, you get rewarded by absolute control over your final product...\n\nOr as much control as one can hope for with brewing.\n\n**KEG**\n\nRemember way back when I said fermented fruit tastes different and there's no way to get that flavor? Well, I lied. The one way to get that sweet fruit flavor in your beer is to kill off all your yeast and keg the beer (you could bottle it, but it will be flat). Once again we're stealing a wine process: stabilizing.\n\nJust before you sterilize your fruit, put the similarly dosed one crushed campden tab per gallon of beer in your fermenter and mix it up good. Let it sit a day to stun and kill your yeast. After a day put in 1/2 tsp per gallon of potassium sorbate into your sterilized beer and let it sit another day. Add your must, mix, and cold crash to drop all of the particulates. Then it is completely safe to keg.\n\n*Wait, when just adding fruit it was okay to add campden, why are we now adding sorbates?*\n\nThe problem with modern, commercial yeast is that is has been cultivated next to campden and other sulfites for so long that they've started developing immunities to them. They won't die to the chemical, but they can be stunned. This is why you need sorbates. The few remaining yeasties that do survive the campden treatment will then bind to the potassium sorbate and stop their replication process. So while they will consume a bit of the sugar present  when adding the must, they won't duplicate and will just fade away.\n\n**Takeaways from this chapter:**\n\n* All of the processes work, some just sacrifice ease of use for flavor or more control\n* Because they all have different end flavors, some processes are better than others for getting your final result (u/EngineeredMadness will hate me for this, but I do like the cooked flavor in that raspberry pie beer I alluded to earlier. Don't need to worry about pectic haze if it's already dark and creamy)\n* I swear by that muslin bag trick, and it works great with a Big Mouth Bubbler EVO 1\n\n# FAQ and personal notes\n\nFavorite gear is the plastic Big Mouth Bubbler EVO 1 because it has the slip ring I can lock the muslin bag into. Makes pouring easier. EVO 2 they changed it to a gasket and looks like it would make for a terrible seal.\n\nFavorite yeast is Wyeast 3638 (Bavarian Wheat) because it has hints of tropical fruits instead of the normal banana bomb. Otherwise US-05 (Chino) because it is so clean.\n\nGrain bill of choice is 70% pils or 2 Row and 30% white wheat. Doesn't get in the way of the fruit and normally I want the fruit center stage.\n\nBest recipe was a chocolate raspberry stout. 5 lbs of raspberries were used and one of those batches was my first sour; not by choice.\n\n*I made a fruit beer and it was cloudy, even after cold crashing.* That was probably pectic haze. Fruit has a thing called pectin (like what you need to make jelly) that can be a pain to get rid of. The two best ways to have a clear product is to **NOT BOIL THE FRUIT** (it releases and binds pectin, making it more visible), and to add pectic enzyme to break it apart. You should only need a quarter tsp (or half ounce (or 15 grams (ooo, triple parenthesis))) of pectic enzyme for 5 gallons of product. Just be sure you don't use it within 12 hours of campden because those two chemicals can mess with each other.\n\nWatermelon wine tastes like you're chewing on the rind and I am so happy I made it rather than just tossing the fruit in a beer.\n\nYes, I did make a pumpkin peach ale after that Super Bowl commercial and I am still upset by that beer because the puree wasn't cheap.\n\nI love r/prisonhooch for what it is and don't want them to change a thing.\n\nIf you think I'm talking out of my ass and you've had no issues with frozen, then you do you. I'm not going to show up to your brew day and berate you about your process. But I will bring beer if I am invited. I just want more better beer in this world and sometimes that means mitigating risks by inconveniencing ourselves.\n\n~~Everyone seems so hung up on the usage of \"sterilized\" because it's not~~ *~~technically~~* ~~sterilized. Well, good thing we're making booze in our kitchens and driveways; not writing papers for a lab journal. Silver to whoever can get me a better word that doesn't make readers think a StarSan rinse or just freezing is a viable solution.~~\n\n# Edits\n\n* Clarified my BMB to be EVO 1.

{"title": "Pilsner vs. 2-row vs. Wheat vs. Maris vs. Vienna vs. Munich", "selftext": "# Background\n\nI\u2019ve been brewing for a number of years and had been basing my choice of base malt on other peoples\u2019 recipes and descriptions of flavor and aromatics.  It occurred to me that while I thought I had a fairly decent grasp of which grain brought what to the table I had never done a side by side comparison for myself.  In fact, I\u2019d never actually tasted any of these malts by themselves without the addition of hops or yeast.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe solution seemed fairly simple, I\u2019d go down to my LHBS and pick up a small quantity of some of the common base malts I\u2019ve been using and see if they actually tasted and smelled how I thought they would.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# Method\n\nSince I only needed enough for samples I opted to pick up 3 oz of the following:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Pilsner (Rahr 1.5-2.0\u00baL)\n* 2-row (Rahr 1.7-2.0\u00baL)\n* Wheat (Avangard 2.0\u00baL)\n* Maris Otter (Simpsons 2.1-2.8\u00baL)\n* Vienna (Avangard 4.0-5.0\u00baL)\n* Munich (Avangard 6.0\u00baL)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI performed 6 mini mashes using 1qt of water at 150 F for 1 hour.  No water adjustments were made since my tap water profile is fairly neutral and I couldn\u2019t be bothered to mess around with such tiny quantities of salts.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# Results\n\nOnce everything had cooled to room temperature I [transferred the worts to glasses](https://imgur.com/a/vROAW5y).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pilsner**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe lightest of all tasted, there were notes of hay, grass and apple skin.  The mouthfeel was low and it left a crisp, dry aftertaste.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2-Row**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSimilar flavors and aromatics to the Pilsner but overall fuller, rounder with more mouthfeel.  The finish was less dry and more neutral.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Wheat**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA light aroma of breakfast cereal, but this was more subdued in flavor.  The wheat had a slight acidity to it but otherwise was the most neutral (to the point of blandness) of all the grains sampled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Maris Otter**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSmelled like grass cuttings that had been left for a while, but not in an unpleasant way.  The flavor \nwas the most pronounced of all all tasted, sort of nutty (think brazil nut), slightly vegetal, fruity, notes of honey dew melon.  This malt was the most complex flavor-wise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Vienna**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSlight caramel aroma, tasted of All-Bran breakfast cereal.  Overall well-rounded and pleasant.  Probably my favorite of all sampled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Munich**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSomewhat similar to Vienna, same breakfast cereal vibe but a little toastier.  Both the aroma and flavor were significantly less pronounced that I had expected, I\u2019d say the Munich was actually more subdued than the Vienna.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# Conclusions\n\nOverall I felt this was a very useful exercise.  While obviously grain flavors will develop and change once boiled with hops and fermented with yeast it was helpful to get a grasp of what the starting points were.  My main take away was that wheat doesn\u2019t bring as much to the party as I originally thought.  It was the most neutral grain to my palette and in the future I will consider using Vienna for the cereal notes I had assumed wheat would bring.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe second surprise was that Munich was overall much more subdued than I was expecting.  As I am not a huge fan of German fest beers I\u2019ve shied away from using Munich in any significant quantity, however following this experiment I will experiment with incorporating it more liberally to add a nice amber color to my brews that require it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/aab54t/pilsner_vs_2row_vs_wheat_vs_maris_vs_vienna_vs/", "created_utc": 1546010293.0, "score": 286, "author": "Neuroplasm", "num_comments": 58, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/aab54t/pilsner_vs_2row_vs_wheat_vs_maris_vs_vienna_vs/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Would you kindly look over my braggot recipes please? I am a beginner at beer", "selftext": "--Sorry in advance for the long post, but the majority of it is two recipes I would like you to look over--\n\nHello! I have been making meads and wines occasionally for the past few years, with several successful batches under my belt (and a few not-so-successful batches as well). I would very much like to get into the beer brewing space, and I thought that bridging the gap with a braggot would be a reasonable place to start.\n\nWith that in mind, I am planning on making a couple 5 gallon batches based on recipes I found online. The first of which is Doin' The Most's [Wampus Cat braggot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlJQm1VSGGk&t=579s). The second is what is called the [Jutland Braggot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/7kxrqv/braggot_recipes_beermead_hybrids/), which I found on Reddit. \n\nI have typed up recipes based on what I saw in the Doin the Most video, and will provide them below. \n\n**My request is thus:** Please tell me if anything here seems off, or if quantities seem off (I am thinking the Jutland uses way more honey and malt extract than the Wampus Cat, which would make for a much bigger beer, right? At least in ABV? Also, if you have any tips for me, they would be much appreciated.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n#**5 Gallon Wampus Cat**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb honey malt\n* 1.5 oz Centennial hops\n* 4.5 lbs wildflower honey\n* 1.5 lbs buckwheat honey \n* Spring Water to 5 gallons\n* Kveik Voss ale yeast -- Rehydrate Yeast with GoFerm. The ratio needed is 1.25x Go-Ferm then multiply that by 20 to get the amount of water. \n* 1 whirl floc tablet\n* Muslin Bag, for mash\n* Nylon brew bag, as I don't have a hop spider\n\nInstructions:\n\nBREW DAY:\n\n* SANITIZE EVERYTHING\n* Measure Ingredients\n* In a stockpot, steep honey malt in 1.5 gallons of spring water at 150-155\u00b0F for an hour. This is easiest when using a brewing bag to hold your grains\n* Strain out grains, rinse them with spring water, squeeze the bag, and discard them\n* Bring water to a boil. \n* 0.5 oz of centennial hops goes in inside the brew bag at the beginning of the boil, rest goes in after 45 minutes of boiling with 1 whirlfloc tablet\n* While boil is going, add honey to brew bucket\n* After 60 minutes, kill flame \n*Strain out hops bag\n* Allow brew to cool down a fair ways\n* While still warm, pour brew mash into ferm bucket with honey\n* Stir to combine\n* Top up to 5 total gallons of volume\n* Pitch Kveik yeast\n\nONGOING:\n\nCheck Gravity every day\n\nOnce it stops fermenting or hits 1.000, rack to secondary\n\nOnce in secondary, add sparkolloid to help it clear up\n\nOnce clear, rack onto priming sugar, then bottle that day\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n#5 Gallon Jutland Braggot Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 6 lbs Dry Wheat Malt Extract \n* 8-10 lbs Wildflower Honey \n* 2 grams Sweet Gale, aka Bog Myrtle (add to the last 5 minutes of boil) \n* 6 lbs frozen cranberries or 1/2 gallon pure cranberry juice (Knudsen is a good brand) \n* Yeast - Safale T-58 (I'm going to use the remainder of the Kveik yeast, is that ok?)\n\nOptional Ingredients: \n\n* \u00bd lb German Rauch Malt or Peat Smoked Malt crushed (steep the malt for 45 min at 150-155\u00b0F) \n* Hops, such as Hallertauer,Tettnanger, Spalt, or Saaz. These are all German hop varieties and are low in bitterness. About 1oz in the boil would be fine. \n* Herbs such as Heather - 2oz , Meadowsweet - 1/2oz, Yarrow - 1oz or Chamomile - 1oz. Add the herbs at the last 5 min of the boil. \n\nBREW DAY: \n\n* SANITIZE EVERYTHING\n* In a large pot add 2 gallons of water (if you are going to use the smoked malt put it in a grain bag and add it to the water). \n* Bring H20 to 150 degrees F and steep the malt for 45 min. \n* After 45 min. remove the malt. \n* Next add the wheat malt extract to the pot and dissolve. Mix thoroughly and bring to a boil. \n* Add hops at this point if you are going to use them (put into a hop bag if desired). \n* Boil for 60 minutes. \n* At the last 5 minutes, add the bog myrtle or other herbs if you choose to use them - make sure you put them in a mesh bag, also called a hop bag - this will help so you don't have to strain them out and prevent \"floaties'. \n* After everything is boiled, take your pot off the heat and add your honey. Stir until all the honey is dissolved. Stir for 2 minutes. \n* Stop stirring and allow the wort to sit for 10 minutes. \n* Now add your frozen cranberries, this will help cool the wort and pasteurize your berries and use a water bath as necessary. If you choose to use the juice or concentrate, add it to the secondary and use just the water bath to cool your wort. (a water bath is filling your sink with water and ice cubes and putting your pot of wort in it to help cool it faster) \n* Once the wort is at about 85\u00b0F, transfer it to your fermenter. \n* Add enough cold water to equal 5 gallons.\n* If you are using dry yeast, rehydrate yeast in boiled and then cooled to 95 degree water. Let sit 10 minutes, covered. \n* Pitch your yeast when it is about 70 degrees and aerate the wort and let ferment!

This design is based around the Raspberry Pi Pico, no soldering required, \u00a3/$/\u20ac6-ish for the microcontroller board, plus the cost of a USB power supply and a micro USB cable. Drag and drop one file and edit one text file to get up and running.\n\nI then got a bit carried away and created the option of adding a display screen, which also requires no soldering, but sort of triples the cost. Then I made myself a 3D printed case. Any option works, just using a Pico board is the cheapest and easiest way to get set up. Some images, more information & code at [https://github.com/jef41/tilt-micro-bridge](https://github.com/jef41/tilt-micro-bridge)\n\nA big potential drawback is that I have only so far integrated Grainfather support and CSV local logging, because that is what I use. If there is a wider interest it should be fairly straightforward to add other integrations like Brewfather, I just don't use those, so I cannot easily test. If you have an interest in some other integration let know.\n\nI know I am late to the party on this, aside from the official app and Raspberry Pi image there are plenty of other integrations, [TiltBridge](https://tiltbridge.readthedocs.io/en/master/) using an ESP32 microcontroller, [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tilt_ble/) to name a couple. Nothing wrong with any of these. I am interested in brewing and in Python software and microcontrollers so I just sort of bashed those things together and made a thing.

{"title": "House Beer Style, French Saison, Brewing Lethargy", "selftext": "I know many of you will have a 'House Beer' that you've always got to hand, but has anyone here found a particular style of beer they brew really well and stuck to it? Maybe you bought a bulk pack of a certain yeast and have been solely brewing riffs of a particular style?\n\nPersonally, I'm feeling an air of lethargy when it comes to brewing, I posted a while ago about being in a funk, bought new gear, went back to basics, reignited the passion, but now I just can't be bothered to mess around with recipes and water additions for 20 different styles any more. I think my lack of passion is leading me to cut corners and produce very average beer. I do the odd shake and brew to experiment and keep the fridge full, but it is a more expensive way of brewing using solely extract and is a bit of a soulless way of brewing, albeit with reasonable to pretty great results, reliable too.\n\nThe thread the other day about a French Saison recipe reminded me that this is a style I have always loved brewing and drinking, and it's a style that always just seems to 'work' for me, I've cut every corner possible with M29 yeast and it's never failed me yet, so that's what I'm doing. Once I've run down the rest of my brewing ingredients I'm buying a bulk pack of M29 and that's all I'm going to brew with for a year.\n\nMy baseline recipe is 100% Pils, aiming for between 5 and 6% ABV. Hopped with Saphir & Mittelfruh to 25-30 IBU. I'm going to try the recommended 10% table sugar addition and will experiment with a small dry hop of Saphir for starters. I'll try various unmalted adjunct additions along the way, and some malted wheat and rye too. Maybe I'll try co-fermenting with Belgian strains for some complexity. Might even spike some bottles with Brett and age for fun.\n\nAnyone got any tried and tested hop combos or other variants on a French Saison I should try? Very interested in a good Table Saison recipe around the 3% mark if anyone has a good one.\n\nCheers!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1kc70l7/house_beer_style_french_saison_brewing_lethargy/", "created_utc": 1746100982.0, "score": 16, "author": "Entire_Researcher_23", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1kc70l7/house_beer_style_french_saison_brewing_lethargy/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Advice: First ever home brew was BAD.", "selftext": "I tried my hand at home brewing with a one gallon starter kit from Northern Brewer with a pale ale recipe. There were two main issues with the beer which made it virtually undrinkable:\n\n1. It was dark. It was supposed to be a pale ale but oh boy was it not pale. I think this also made it have a quite intense taste; very \u201choppy\u201d in a sense. What made it so dark? Did I not boil it long enough or mix it enough or something?\n\n2. There was little to no carbonation. I bought glass bottles with a \u201cpop top\u201d cap for reusability, and so I think it was a combination of bad brewing and weak seal on the bottles. Is there any way to strengthen the seal or do I just need to get a bottling kit with \u201cnormal\u201d bottle caps? \n\n3. With the carbonation, the instructions said to add sugar as food for the yeast when the beer was bottled but my dad said that would negatively affect the taste. Instead, we used ~2 Tbsp of excess malt to complete the fermentation in the bottles. Next time should I stick to the recipe and do the sugar? Or is it common to do the malt instead?\n\nFor my next attempt, I really want it to come out well. How can I address these issues? And also, is Northern Brewer a good company to get ingredients from? Should I try a different recipe, or get the ingredients separately, or try a different company?\n\nI wasted 4 weeks for a disgusting beer and I really just want my next batch to be at least slightly palatable!

Both beers finished around 5.3% abv (81% attenuation)\n\nDiamond Lager seemed to be more... \"lagery\" than the S-189 batch. I don't know how to describe it, perhaps it is more of a certain ester.

Most of my beers are low to medium OG (1.035-1.050).   \n\n\nI do BIAB inside the anvil basket. For the higher OG recipes, I sparge. For lower OG recipes, I do not. This is dictated by malt limits. \n\nI do BIAB.   \nRecently, I've made 3 IPAs with relatively similar recipes. I will give the variation below. All are 12 gallon batches. All used BIAB with sparging. No significant variations in water temps or volumes. All received similar water treatments of calcium chloride and lactic acid adjustments to 5.35 ph calculated.

Is there anything about using large quantities of flaked oats that can cause efficiency issues? The mash was pretty thick, at around 1.45 lbs/qt, but it seemed reasonable. In the first and third batch I had less malted oats than the second batch, but I did add some rice hulls. I know rice hulls are not strictly needed for BIAB, but my thought was without them the oats might turn into a blob.\n\nMy thought for next time is to significantly reduce the oat percentage and compensate with increased malt. I'm still curious why I got such different results from the second batch. Obviously there could be any number of issues wrong with my process, or things I don't track and am not aware of. The sparge definitely drained a bit more slowly than I am used to, so I thought that perhaps insufficient rice hulls or too thick of a mash was causing issues. I'm open to any other ideas or thoughts. \n\nI mill my own grain with a consistent size, treat the water similarly, it's all grain bought within the last few months, and other styles (pilsners, munich dunkels, hefeweizen, etc.) tend to show consistent BHE admittedly at lower OGs. It's worth pointing out that a lower OG recipes with a similar proportion to above also missed target OG by 10%, so it seems to be a trend with these specific recipes. \n\n(My recipes with a large % of Munich also tend to get lower efficiency, but they are consistent with one another.)\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k9g419/low_efficiency_on_neipas/", "created_utc": 1745792240.0, "score": 2, "author": "spoonman59", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k9g419/low_efficiency_on_neipas/", "html_title": ""}

I upped the brew length to 20L, and made a few substitutions based on availability, cost or what I had to hand - Maris Otter instead of Pale Ale, Dextrin malt instead of Carapils, and WHC Low Rider instead of Lallemand Windsor (less well-known brand, but is also a low-attenuating maltotriose negative strain). According to Brewfather, the ABV should be 0.7% with my adjustments. Apart from that, I followed the recipe as written.\n\nThe first time I brewed it, I wasn't paying very close attention and forgot to take an OG reading, but I guessed it would be about or a bit less than the recipe, which is 1.026. I also left it in the fermenter for a bit longer, because I ran out of CO2 and life got a bit busy. When I got around to kegging it, the FG reading came out at *1.002* (per the recipe it should have been 1.021), so ABV around 2-3%.\n\nSecond time, I decided to pay a bit closer attention - repeated the same process, OG was 1.020.

That wouldn\u2019t be an issue if the outlet below the hot plate was clear, but that is also clogged with hop matter.\n\nThe consequence of this is that there is about 1.5 L of hot wort left in my Grainfather which I was not aware of and could not transfer to my fermenter as I assumed the trickle meant that there was no more hot wort. In addition, the hop plate obscures my vision of the outlet pipe so wasn\u2019t able to tell until I was at the cleaning stage.\n\nAnd OMG the amount of burnt sugars on the bottom of the unit is unreal.

{"title": "Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout with gravity that is way off", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nPretty new to the homebrewing game, long time lurker ;).\n\nLast month, we attempted to brew an Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout (based on [this recipe](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/402144/imperial-chocolate-milk-stout-50l-)).\n\nWe ran into a few problems. First, the recipe mentions lactose twice, once under 'fermentables' and once under 'other ingredients'. We loaded the recipe into our Brewmonk B40 via BeerXML, and it showed up twice there too. Since it's exactly the same amount both times, I suspect it's a mistake in the recipe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlso, our starting gravity was too low, and the final gravity way too high. We started at 1.066 (instead of 1.082) and ended at 1.028 instead of 1.012. Fermentation seemed to finish way too quickly\u2014after 5 days, nothing was happening anymore. We tried raising the temperature to 22\u00b0C and added Safale F-2 yeast to try and restart it, but no luck.\n\nThis Saturday, we're going to try again, and I was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice. A few things I think might\u2019ve gone wrong:\n\n* Sparging went too fast. I read online that it can take 30\u201345 minutes, but we were done in 10. Not sure how to improve this. Finer milling?\n* We added the yeast when the wort was still too warm.\n* Maybe the yeast was too cold\u2014not taken out of the fridge early enough?\n\nVery curious what you all think.\n\nFor those interested, I try to make a video of each brew day - here\u2019s the [video of our first attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PZyswStB1g) (It's in Dutch though!)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k6r918/imperial_chocolate_milk_stout_with_gravity_that/", "created_utc": 1745498596.0, "score": 1, "author": "florianvo", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k6r918/imperial_chocolate_milk_stout_with_gravity_that/", "html_title": ""}

The addition is disposed of because presumably I have extracted most of the flavor available given the timeframe I soaked the addition.  The liquid tincture is the thing of value.\n\nHowever, when preparing to \u201cwood condition\" a beer using my method in point number 2, I soak a wood spiral in a spirit and then dispose of the spirit.  Would it be more impactful to my beer to toss out the wood after being soaked and then add the wood-note-filled spirit instead?  (Or perhaps add the spirit at packaging but also continue with the wood conditioning as I currently do it?)\n\nI guess my question is this:  When I soak a wood spiral in liquor, what is happening more: the wood having absorb spirit notes or the spirit taking on wood notes?\n\nFor example, I will be making a margarita-flavored gose soon and I want to add some tequila notes using an oak spiral.

Seems to be going badly and I'm still mashing.\n\nIssue 1: mash temperature overshoot. I use a brew monk Magnus AIO, set up my temps and the wattage low for keeping it warm (1000w). It's repeatedly overshot and hit 68+deg c so I'm worried I'm getting to lower my conversion.\n\nThrew in some cold water at one point but it happened again later on and I can't keep diluting it.\n\nShould I set my AIO to heat differently?\n\nIssue 2: stuck mash. I circulate via the pump and it repeatedly got stuck. Given it several big stirs and it ran a little better but not great. This is a big grain bill but my device theoretically can handle it.\n\nAnyone with AIO got tips on water ratios? I thought I allowed enough but maybe should have allowed for more, or maybe it's just too much grain despite what the device claims to handle?\n\nIssue 3: probably a result of above, my OG is currently looking too low against the recipe target, about 1.055 and I've not sparged yet. Target is 1.068. I'm mashing for another 30 mins to take me to 90 in total but not hopeful it will be a magic fix.\n\nI'll keep going and make something hopefully drinkable, but having got up and cleaned, and set aside a day to do, this hobby feels like hard work at times!\n\n(Sorry for the minor ranting and complaining)\n\n______________\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\nThanks everyone for replying and the advice, I haven't been able to reply to everyone individualy but appreciate the responses.\n\nThe temperature regulation sounds fixable and I likely am using a higher wattage than needed.\n\nStuck mash, I need to find some rice hulls. Mash sticking hasn't generally been a problem before. I don't have a grain mill, so buy it pre-milled and this hasn't been an issue before.

I currently do 5l stove top batches and whilst everything went to plan, I had one stumbling block which I hope I resolved but wanted some advice. \n\nI took a reading with my EasyDens pre-boil and the wort was 1.043, I was 7 points below where I thought I should be at 1.050. Not too concerned but was prepared for a low post boil gravity\u2026\n\nNow this is where it gets interesting, previously I\u2019ve had very low post boil gravities and I think it was because my boil wasn\u2019t vigorous enough.

I tested multiple times and every time it was the same reading, so I liquor\u2019d it back with about a litre and a half of water to get to my required gravity of 1.059.

I\u2019ve read that you can get odd readings if taking from the top part of the boiling wort - however from what I\u2019ve read this seems to be for extract kits, is this the same for all grain?\n\nSecondly, did I do the right thing by adding the water? \n\nThirdly, how do I reduce this from happening in the future?

With the yield of this yeast, I should get a solid 5% even before priming.\n\nNotes on taste: So for reference, I tried to have AI scale my recipe from a 5 gallon to one gallon, except it cut out the Vienna malt which might have made a difference due to being on the \"search\" function rather than just analyzing the data I put in. Rookie mistake. \n\nIt has a very pleasant, stout-y type character. Slight smokey taste, like burnt grains. Not unpleasant but not what I was expecting. Super dry, which I don't mind. The LAB add a nice, slight sour kick to it that helps mellow out the darkness of the ale. Bit hoppy for my taste, bit more bitter than the last one I made.\n\nI'm gonna let it sit another week for more of the trub to fall out into the bottom before bottle conditioning. It's bone-dry, and I wonder if this isn't because of my putting the grains in the water before it hits malting temps in the 130s or so. \n\nAny advice or pointers regarding this specific style would be great. I like it generally speaking, I just would prefer it to be slightly lighter or sweeter.\n\nI'd like to re-use this yeast cake for an amber of some sort.

I then added roeselare blend, added the airlock, and waited. I tasted every 2-3 months and after 12 months it still wasn't really sour. I added some bottle dregs (which I forgot to take notes on) and by the 18 month mark gen 1 was ready for bottling. I was pretty happy with it. OK sourness. Great expression from the yeast and bacteria, but lacking a lot of maltiness and malt complexity. Also, lacking oak. Also, quite dry compared to the benchmark - Rodenbach.\n\nSo a added back the 50% I had bottled (I didn't change the recipe as I hadn't tasted the beer yet) and this time I added 1/2 an oak spiral for a week.\n\nGen 2 has now been bottled and it's pretty much just gen 1 but a little more sour and with a little oak.

Lived in San Diego during the craft beer boom of the 2010s, read Randy Mosher\u2019s books on beer style/history and homebrewing, Greg Koch\u2019s Stone Brewing book, etc. **Despite** a high general interest in beer, homebrewing always looked unapproachable to me.\n\n**Two major aspects that always turned me off to homebrewing** were the ubiquitous brewing \u201cstandard\u201d of 5 gallons and the \"gear\".\n\nI have neither the thirst for *that* much beer nor the space/money for the equipment. These things are very in line with Gen Z. We\u2019re drinking way less alcohol and don\u2019t have the money or space to spare (3% of homeowners are Gen Z aged). Anytime I\u2019d search homebrewing how-to\u2019s (not beginner tutorials, but stuff like \u201csimple pale ale recipe), everyone is brewing on a 10 gal brewing system that costs +$1000. They\u2019re making +5 gallons of beer, kegging it and serving/storing out of the kegerator in their garage/basement.\n\nBut one day I saw both Clawhammer Supply and Norther Brewer 1 gallon kit videos and that finally inspired me. And also this [\u201cGlen and Friends Cooking\u201d video]( https://youtu.be/HVM6xwbUQmU) on a 1 gallon all-grain batch.\n\nSmall batch brewing and BIAB solved all my issues. By small batch I mean in the range of 1 to 2.5 gallons. 1.25 gallons is the perfect sweet spot for me, as I can easily 1/4th a recipe. And with a brew bag it allows me to brew in my kitchen and use kitchen equipment I already own.\n\nMy first 1 gallon batch from the Northern Brewer kit was perfectly serviceable and but if I had to drink 50-60 bottles of it, I would have not even bothered lol. The benefit of being able to scale down recipes means I get more usage out of my ingredients too, a 10lb bag of grains can go to 4 batches of beer rather than just 1. Things are way more manageable and I get more practice.\n\nI also upgraded to kegging/co2 with a 1.6 gallon Torpedo Keg. It stores nicely in my fridge. I still use the 1.4 gallon fermenter that came from my Northern Brewer kit and that also sits nicely in my kitchen cabinet.\n\n**Rant time**, feel free to comment \u201cshut up kid\u201d after reading this lol\n\nIMO, I think a not-so-insignificant potion of the problem in the decline of newcomers has come from the front-facing media space of the homebrewing community. I don\u2019t want to come off as anti-gear, nor am I talking about any random Youtube homebrewer that has a high tech mini-brewery set up, what I am saying is that given the shifting divide in drinking habits and money/space that Gen Z and future generations experience, those that bemoan the decline of newcomers on \u201chomebrewing Youtube\u201d should consider working alongside that shift.\n\nDon\u2019t just tell them that extract brewing or BIAB exist, show it! Celebrate it as much as all-grain! Don\u2019t make it a one-off video or some list video about \u201ctop 10 cost-effective brewing tips\u201d. LEAD by example. Show how crazy you can get with just a brew bag and stock kettle. Make it part of a regular content schedule alongside the usual 10 gal equipment videos.\n\nTake for instance this recently released Clawhammer Supply video (love the company btw! This is just a critique)\n\n[How to Make a German Pilsner Using the Easy Lager Fermentation Method - Brew Beer at Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QrvHGQruUo)\n\nThe original title for video btw was (had the tab open still when I was writing this post)\n\n>[German Pilsner - Easy Lager Fermentation Method - **How to Make Your First Homemade Beer**]\n\nWhen it was under the original title, is that *really* the video a beginner should see when they search \u201chow to make beer\u201d? They used their \u201c10 Gallon 120V Electric Brew System\u201d It\u2019s a +$1000 brewing system. I get that they are a brewing supply company, but in how world is that \u201cfirst homemade beer\u201d content?? It even says in the video description that it\u2019s a beginner guide to brewing. Insane. Not only that, but they ended up canning the beer?? These sort of contrasts make the cost and accessibility divide very apparent. I think there\u2019s a real flaw in thinking that all homebrewers will *want* to start with or upgrade to some stainless steel brewing system or increase brewing volume.\n\nOf course with any content creation, you\u2019re in a balancing act of \u201cWho is your audience?\u201d They're making content for more serious homebrewers. And I\u2019m not trying to say to pivot to only making 1 gallon extract videos or catering only to beginners and pumping out slop, but let\u2019s expand to all levels of brewing if you\u2019re trying to reinvigorate a supposedly \u201cdying\u201d hobby.\n\nMaybe reintroduce stuff like BIAB regularly to new audiences or make more videos using everyday kitchen equipment that doesn\u2019t rely on a AIO brewing system. Highlight more extract/partial mash brews, easier to consume volumes, make a whole assortment of SMaSH ale videos to showcase how bare bones brewing recipes can be while still tasting amazing. Or conversely make that imperial stout video *but* small batch and using only a brew bag+kitchen equipment.\n\nAnd again this goes to all beer homebrewing channels and influencers/advocates, not trying to pick on Clawhammer Supply, they\u2019re great! They have very polished fun videos, they livestream brew days, but I can\u2019t quite help but feel that the big picture is still being missed. TheBruSho also talked about something similar on his channel about getting back to showcasing simpler brewing methods so I feel like I'm not alone in this.\n\n**Final words**\n\nApproachability, accessibility and cost-effectiveness should have just as much attention as expensive temperature controlled pressure fermenters and shiny stainless steel all-in-one systems. Clearly brewing isn\u2019t as \u201cdead\u201d as we think since mead channels have become bigger. But look at how they present the hobby, the largest mead making channels are still using 1 gallon, basic carboys! Granted mead is an easier process, but beer brewing can look just as approachable too!\n\nDiving into this hobby has been incredibly fun and empowering. The absolute WEALTH of knowledge&experience on this subreddit from every user and the greater homebrewing forums/community has been priceless. I wrote this because of how excited I was to finally start brewing so it was a shock to see how much the current discourse has been about \u201chomebrew is dead/dying\u201d.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jwamsi/small_batch_brewing_got_me_into_homebrewing_a/", "created_utc": 1744323996.0, "score": 64, "author": "jacksniper", "num_comments": 54, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jwamsi/small_batch_brewing_got_me_into_homebrewing_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

They have stainless head MP-15RM 110v pumps that already have tri clamp connections, hoses, and what looks like a water proof power switch and breaker box all attached to these custom little stainless stands with handles and a parts dish. I think they're a cool design and I'll probably keep one for myself, but the weird thing is it looks like the company that made these never actually sold any. There is zero info online and the company seems to never have had any listed for sale, they are also a cold brew company not beer, but as someone who works in distilling professionally and does some home brewing myself I definitely think these are cool and see the value for home brewers.The problem I have is if I'm going to try and sell the extra ones I have I don't really have anything to compare them to for a price point. I know the pumps alone are about $60 on amazon, I have a few of my own already, and the extra tc fittings, hose,  and electrical components would probably be like $40ish depending on sourcing. So I was thinking to list these for like $150 bucks a piece plus shipping, estimated to be about $15. My question to you all is does this seem useful and does my pricing idea seem reasonable for  these? Part of me feels like I might be undervaluing these since I know from experience custom stainless work is really expensive, but I don't honestly know how much home brewers would value that aspect.

It is clear that you use half as much T-45 as you would T-90 hops and general consensus is that you want to aim for a 50/50 mix of T-45 to T-90 pellets. Also, T-45 are really only good for late hot side and cold side hop additions. And reading up hopshot seems to be pretty straightforward, just add right to the boil.\n\nThis WC IPA will be 5.5 gal batch targeting a 1.064 OG and finish around 7% abv. Targeting around 73 ibu.\n\nMy hop schedule: \n-4 mL Columbus hop shot @ 75 min\n-0.8 oz Centennial T-90 at 10 min\n-0.8 oz Nelson T-90 at 10 min\n-1.2 oz Centennial T-90 at whirlpool\n-1.2 oz Nelson T-90 at whirlpool\n-1 oz Chinook T-45 @ dry hop\n-1 oz Motueka T-45 @ dry hop\n-2 oz Moutere T-90 @ dry hop\n\nLet me know if anyone thinks there is room for improvement or if you agree with my approach.

{"title": "Amazon counter-pressure bottler", "selftext": "I'm not ready to keg yet, but I also wasn't happy with using a bottling bucket and priming sugar for carbonation, so I took an intermediate step.  Found a guy selling 11 pallets of kegs for $20 each and got two of them that had carbonation stones.\n\nSo I did a closed transfer from my Fermzilla to the keg, and set it up for forced carbonation at 30psi (10 for the stone, 18 from a chart based on beer style and temperature, and another 2 just because).  However, it was still carbonating after several hours, and I just stopped because I was afraid of over carbonating the beer.\n\nBut the main part of this post was to talk about the lever-operated counter pressure bottlers showing up on Amazon.  I'd had mine in my list for months, and when I went to buy it the price jumped 15%.  That pretty much sucked, and it wasn't noticeable BEFORE it went in the cart.  I've had this issue with stuff I've purchased from Amazon before.  As it was, it was 50% of the price of a Boel device or clone.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/uI3NpJ6](https://imgur.com/a/uI3NpJ6)\n\nThis device has 4 ports, and no instructions in english.  Communications with the sellers didn't help, I had to figure it out.  Basically, gas goes in the left upper port, beer in the right.  The lower left port is for purging the bottle, the lower right port when cracked gets the beer flowing.\n\nA few things this device needs:\n\n1. a backlight so you can better see where the beer is in the neck.  I'll probably 3d print a mount for some Amazon light.\n2. a collection jar with a mount to the back to catch the foam.  Probably will 3D print that as well.\n3. a drip tray to mount it to - there's a lot of drippage\n4. a means to clamp it down.  If you have a big enough drip tray it might work without a clamp, but actuating the lever over-centers the device and tips it over.\n5. a hose to go from the nipple under the seal to the bottom of your bottles.\n\nOther improvements:\n\n1. re-designing the linkage so that you can pull the lever from the front\n2. more common line sizes - all of the lines are 5/16 ID, nearly 1/2\" OD.  Could not find adapters at Home Depot, our local hardware store, or even McMaster Carr, so I made some by putting 1/4\" compression sleeves inside my 5/16 lines, stuffing those into the 1/2\" lines and hose clamping them.  Worked fine, no leaks.\n3. instead of the compression connections at the machine for beer and gas, ball locks would have been much easier.  And for some reason, they used a duotite fitting instead of a compression on the gas bleed line.  if those compression adapters are 1/4 NPT on the machine side this will be an easy fix (but another $20)\n\nSetup requires adjusting the upper clamp bolt (where the lever attaches at the top) to put enough spring pressure on the silicone seal when it sits on the bottle such that it won't lift at the pressure you are bottling at.  This takes a bit of trial and error.  I started at 20 PSI.  Then you adjust the bottom clamp that the mechanism rests on when there's no bottle in it.\n\nTo use it you:\n\n1. lift the mechanism with the lever and place a bottle under the seal, and release the lever.\n2. Turn the handle to the left.  Gas will enter the bottle\n3. turn the bleed screw to vent the gas out of the bottle; then close the bleed screw.\n4. turn the handle to the right.  Beer might start flowing slowly, if not, crack the liquid knob on the right.  It doesn't take much to really get it going.  It is much faster than a bucket wand filler.

{"title": "Market Homebrewing (and Brewing Content) as the Cost Effective way to Drink Beer", "selftext": "I started as a poor student who had $50 for a brew bucket, spoon, airlock, and a tin of Coopers Australian Lager. I was bragging to my buddies I made beer that's \"good enough\" for 50 cents a bottle. Over the years I got better equipment (and experience). The tone changed from trying to convince friends the beer is okay to receiving praises and jubilation. This is probably a familiar story with most people reading this. \n\nWith a dreary outlook of our local homebrew shops, they need new blood to keep the hobby going. The incoming global recession and tariffs on beer cans translates to consumers looking to curb luxury spending (aka beer). Encouraging those consumers to try basic fermentation kits and/ or cheap brew in a bag recipes with household equipment is 1: A good way to get new comsumers into hobby. 2: Keep the market afloat through rough economic times. Spell it out how cheap this is per bottle, if they enjoy it they'll get sucked in deeper when they can afford it\n\nWatching videos of Martin Keen using his $1000 fermenter, $1500 glycol chiller, on a $1000 brew vessel is cool and what I strive for but I'm not spending $3000+ day 1 on any new hobby. Not knocking you Martin, you do great content! But you can start feeling overwhelmed by the expensive options. If I wanted to get into sewing, a $3000 machine would be intimidating, I'll start with a needle and thread and see where that leads me. I'd love to absorb more 'back to basics' homebrew content, anyone remember Craigtube?\n\nAdmittedly, my bias is in the message. A buddy came back from an extended stay in Germany where beer is a fraction of the cost at home. Once back he realized he was shorter on cash because beer was comparatively expensive here, why not brew it himself and save some money. \n\nWe need more 'brewing for the everyperson' messages that encourage folks to lean into hobby and dive into the community. Content creators and retailers, tell everyone how great your products are, but don't forget to remind people it would work wonderfully with inexpensive options too.\n\n'This much beer from the store retails $100, but with our system it'll cost you $20 a batch. Save even more by reusing your yeast and *these* cost saving measures on your next brew. After 'X' batches the system pays for itself' At least that's how I justified my first brew vessel. \n\nKeep flaunting your rigs but remind folks of \\[most of our\\] humble beginnings.\n\nTL;DR - Encourage inexpensive accessibility to brewing and spell it out for folks curious about the hobby.

{"title": "Using immersion cooling coil to cool fermenter: Peltier water cooler over ice-water resevoir?", "selftext": "Hi all,  \n\nRecently I've been thinking about preparing my fermentation setup for the warm summer months, and my primary concern is keeping the fermenters at a consistent temperature. Last summer I tried the tub of water method with frozen water bottles to keep it at a constant cooler temp, but this was less than reliable due to me being busy, and a hassle I wouldn't mind throwing a few bucks at to solve.  \n\nEver since I saw the TempTwister from Kegland (basically an immersion chiller for your fermenter) I was thinking about using an STC temp controller with a small pump and an ice water resevoir to chill the fermenter, but then I saw a cheap 20-30 dollar peltier cooler setup online that was designed to chill water and it looks almost perfect, so I wanted to see what you guys thought.  \n\nHere's a mock-up of my idea: [https://imgur.com/onwVUWz](https://imgur.com/onwVUWz)  \n\nThe cooler is 150-230 watts depending on the model, and estimating a conservative measure of 30 watts of heat being produced by the fermenter at full tilt, I think this should be able to handle that heat no problem. With the sleeping bag I use for insulation, I've had it at a delta of 5C under ambient and only lose about .5 degree a day, so I'm hoping that it will be able to stave off warm air temperature fluctuation (and potentially the occasional heatwave) and really reduce the need for the cooling system to run.  \n\nI know that Peltier cooling is horribly inefficient compared to the refrigeration process, but I don't have the space for another fridge/freezer, so I was looking for something like this as a compact and put-away-able solution. I'm hoping that I can get a duty cycle around .25 (again a conservative measure considering nights) to keep it in the mid 60's F and over two weeks I think it should burn \\~9kw or a \\~$1.50 in power, cheaper than buying even a small bag of ice .  \n\nUnless my estimates are way off and impractical, this seems to a really cheap and effective solution, so I was wondering why this hasn't been talked about more?

{"title": "Cold Crashing", "selftext": "Ive had a problem for some time now: a large percentage of my homebrew beer tastes fantastic following fermentation, but loses all flavor and develops a slight off-flavor that is difficult to describe after cold crashing. \n\nI have a somewhat unique cold-side setup, in that I ferment in a WilliamsWarn BrewKeg10, for which I also serve in. These fermenters are unitanks and I can dump trub without transferring and then serve. \n\nIt\u2019s taken me many batches to confirm the cold crash is the point of failure, but I\u2019ve repeated it a few times now.  It even occurs if I do transfer. The kegs remain under pressure the entire time, and I don\u2019t believe there is any oxygen ingress. Nor an infection, as it tastes fine until I drop the temperature. \n\nMy best guess is that the yeast haveu some sort of thermal shock going on. When I google, it seems to suggest this is a well documented phenomenon, but anecdotally every homebrew discussion online on this topic says it\u2019s a myth. Given the discrepancy between others and rate at which I see it, I\u2019m am wondering if something else is going on. Or maybe my small batches (10L) in a wine fridge just cool more rapidly than others. \n\nAny other ideas? Am I possibly not dumping all the yeast first (I do wait 2+ weeks), steady FG with a tilt, and it tastes good warm.

{"title": "Kentucky Common: please advise on my first all-grain brew & recipe", "selftext": "I've learning about the existence of Kentucky Common two days ago, and have decided to brew one tomorrow night to bring to a friends May 3rd Derby/birthday party. I'll be using my speidel 3.2 gallon fermenter (it's really a bit larger, should be able to handle 3 gallons or a little less). I couldn't find a pre-built recipe that was exactly what I wanted, but based on what I could find, I have decided on the following:\n\n* 3.25 lb 6 row\n\n* 1.25 lb flaked corn\n\n* 2.3 oz chocolate malt\n\n* 2.3 oz crystal 40\n\n* .45 oz cluster for bittering at 60 minutes\n\n* .2 oz cluster for aroma at 5 minutes\n\nBrewfather tells me that the above with 4.19 gallons of pre-boil water will get me a 3 gallon final batch with no sparge, with ABV 4.5%, SRM 14, and IBU 22. I haven't plugged numbers into Brunwater yet but I'm thinking amber balanced? Possibly with a little extra gypsum.\n\nWhile I would have used US-05 if I had more time, given the short timeline, I am thinking half a packet of Kveik Lutra will do the trick, with a little fermaid-O 6-12 hours after pitch. Brewing tomorrow night with Lutra will hopefully allow bottling next Wednesday or shortly thereafter, which will allow 3 weeks of bottle conditioning followed by 72 hours in the fridge before the party.\n\nI wanted to keep this as historically accurate as possible without getting too crazy (see flaked corn instead of grits) and obviously with the exception of using Kveik (which others seem to have had success with in these beers). I almost left the aroma out entirely since it wasn't clear to me how historically accurate that is and me and my friends usually prefer minimal to none obvious hop flavor, but I figured a little wouldn't be overpowering or overshadow the rest of the beer.\n\nThis will be my first all-grain, the first recipe I've ever designed, and the first time I've ever adjusted my water. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Bottles are much lighter, easier to drink from and the batch oxidize more slowly as the bottles are emptied when opened. They are also way cheaper when sharing beer to friends and family!\r\n\r\nBut how do you ferment in bottles? Trub takes up so much space and dryhopping is really hard to do effectively. Often only about half of the bottle is somewhat clear beer and the rest is trub and hops. I just can't find hopbags small enough. Also go through a lot of caps because of the blowups (and dryhopping in the middle of fermentation). Wanted to share a tip though, before dryhopping you can breath co2 into the bottles to prevent oxidation .\r\n\r\nCan you find spunding valves or a adapter that would make them fit my bottles?

{"title": "New To All-Grain / Inconsistent Efficiency", "selftext": "My wife and I have been homebrewing for 2+ years, mostly using Dry Malt Extract and having decent results.  We both wanted to try to move to all-grain brewing, so at the beginning of 2025, we decided do so.  \n\nWe are not trying to be crazy and chase these incredibly high efficiencies that I know some people do and it can drive them crazy.  We just want to be a bit more consistent so that when we plan recipes, we be closer to those numbers or hit them more often than not.\n\nOut of our four all-grain attempts, we have been approximatley 51%, 62%, 50%, 46% efficient (according to the brewers friend efficiency calculator).  We use brewfather and if I take the recipe we just used, which I planned for 60% efficiency, and adjust it to what we actually were (46%) the OG comes out close, if not spot on to what we hit.  \n\nEquipment:\n\n* Anvil Foundry 6.5 gallon (120V)\n* A glass wide mouth bubbler fermenter from Northern Brewer\n* Tilt Hydrometer\n* Brewbag \n\nOur brew process is typically this:\n\n1.  Fill Anvil Foundry with 3.25 gallons of water, set to 156\u00b0F (Strike temp) at 100% power  \n2.  While the water is heating, we measure the ingredients we will need.  \n3.  Once the water reaches 156\u00b0F, I set the temp to 152\u00b0F and set the power to 80%  \n4.  Pour in grain into the brew bag which is over the grain basket (we have also tried using the brew bag directly over the foundry as well)  \n5.  Stir grain, and begin 60 minute mash timer.  We typically stir every 10-15 minutes during this 60 minute mash.  \n6.  Once we have reached the 60 minute mark, we mash out at 170\u00b0F for approximately 10 minutes.  \n7.  We lift the grain up, allow it to drain for a few minutes, while we set the Anvil to boil and 100% power.  \n8.  Bring wort to a boil, and brew like we did with DME, adding our hops, etc.   \n9.  We typically end up right at or just slightly above our target of 2 gallons going into the fermenter.\n\n* Grain is coming from a local homebrew store, they are crushing it for us.\n* Temperature reading for the strike water, mash water, and boil is all coming straight from the LCD screen on the Anvil Foundry\n* We are currently not recirculating during the mash (but we do have a pump and hoses and would have the ability to if we needed to)\n\nThe Anvil Foundry manual recommends 3.8 gallons of water for 4 lbs of grain with a strike temperature of 156\u00b0F (Anvil Foundry running at 120v)\n\nOr it recommends 3.9 gallons of water for 5 lbs of grain with a strike temperature of 157\u00b0F (Anvil Foundry running at 120v)\n\nBoth of these are assuming you want to yield 2.5 gallons going into your fermenter.\n\nLooking at one of Northern Brewer's recipe's, they say \"if you are new to all grain, we recommend 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain for mash thickness\".  \n\nIf I'm doing the math correctly, that would put us at less than 2 gallons of water for 5 lbs of grain which seems a bit low.\n\n  \nSo...\n\nWhat can we change or fix within reason?  Personally, I would like to make one or two changes at a time and not change a bunch of stuff.  Too many variables at once seemingly make it more difficult to figure out what is or isn't working.  \n\nYour help is greatly appreciated.  I can provide pictures of the grain crush, or anything else for that matter if you need it.  \n\nThank you!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jnkcve/new_to_allgrain_inconsistent_efficiency/", "created_utc": 1743362835.0, "score": 8, "author": "KMFL87", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jnkcve/new_to_allgrain_inconsistent_efficiency/", "html_title": ""}

It seems like it's possible there would be no downside to just opening the port fully right from the start. My thinking was that even if some beer channeled through the trub and hops, eventually that heavier material would work it's way down and the beer would be displaced and head upwards. On dump four, I just opened it fully and walked away for ten minutes. Upon return, it seemed like most of what was in the cup was think hop material with the most dense material in the bottom.

What, if anything, should I do to help fix it?\n\nCome and hear my tale of woe, and hopefully learn from my mistakes.\n\nI'm brewing a witbier that will be served to celebrate my newborn that is due one month from now. Hoping the timeline works out. It's a gamble. It's meant to be a 5 gallon batch. I did my research, made my recipe, ordered supplies. Today, I'm getting ready to dough in, and realize I've got an extra pound each of flaked wheat and pilsner malt. After doing some quick calculations, I realize I must have made this change earlier and forgotten about it, and decided to just use all of it. Foreshadowing, this may have saved my bacon.\n\nMash goes great, holding a steady 152F for an hour, stirring occasionally. I BIAB, so at Mash out, I raise my bag on the pulley I have installed, and give her a good squeeze. Sometimes I sparge over the bag, sometimes not. I didn't, and this time, I definitely should have. The water was noticably low in the pot (I assume the wheat and rice hulls held onto more water than malt usually would). Anyway, I decided I'd just top it up at the end of the boil. Plus side to this is the boil and chill will both be more efficient with lower boil volume. So I sanitize and fill two kitchen pots with filtered tap water. This is something I've done before with good results.\n\nAs I'm chilling, I pour in the two pots of water. Now that water line is significantly higher than usual. Uh oh. Well, I'm committed now.\n\nI complete the rest of the process, and rack to the fermenter. It's waaay too full. So I pitch my yeast, mix as well as I can without spilling the beer, then scrubbed and sanitized a spare 1 gallon growler, bung, and airlock. I rack off the gallon, and the level in the fermenter is better now. Problem is, my original OG I was aiming for was 1.053. But now it's only 1.036. With a complete fermentation, that's kind of a small beer. I'm also worried my pitch rate will be really really low.\n\nLessons learned:\n\nOnly top up level in the fermenter itself, or once I have a brewpot with graduated markings, use that as a guide.\n\nTake better notes on my recipe ahead of time.\n\n\n\nSo the question is: should I attempt to fix this beer by adding sugar or something? Should I pitch another pouch of yeast in a few days when I can get some? Or should I leave it be, and just learn lessons for the future?\n\n  \nThanks all!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jkh509/screwed_up_my_witbier_bad_tips_on_fixing_it/", "created_utc": 1743009508.0, "score": 1, "author": "dezstern", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jkh509/screwed_up_my_witbier_bad_tips_on_fixing_it/", "html_title": ""}

Everything else was exactly as the recipe called for. Does anybody have any idea what could have possibly caused this flavor to arise?

I heard so many amazing stories - it literaly made my day \u2665\ufe0f. Had alot of nice chat. Thats what its about - community. THANK YOU!\n\nGoood day people!!\n\nI got into brewing 3 years ago. Jumped straight in. Learning alot. Making notes. Finding the brews I love. It was almost all that I could think about. \n\nNot gona lie. After few years I am not that super in to it. But mainly because I have alot of knowledge and brewing became natural as baking a pizza on saturday evening. I have the brews our family likes to drink or have around. So it is just a part of our lives. Yes I try new recipes. And yes I try new brewing methods. But it does consume way less of my time as when starting out.\n\nIn my opinion homebrewing is no way dead, but is sure looks like it sometimes.. I mean it is crazy that you can make super tasty stuff that you cant get in a supermarket.. And oh boy. With all the price increases of groceries and overall cost of living. LMAO. You can make super solid craft beer or mead for the third of the price..\n\nI never bought fancy equipment. My celar is full of cider, meads, beer. I use a bucket and a stock pot. Do I dream about stainless steel stuff? You bet I do.. But I can not afford it sadly..\n\nBut on the other hand I could see why its feels like homebrewing is dying. There are fewer subredits or posts in homebrewtalk. Many content creators just stoped pumping out new recipe videos. I guess they were \u201cat the peak performance\u201d back then. New recipes new videos new ideas. But for how long can you do it. Life hits. You have kids etc. \n\nIm 100% sure that they are brewing constantly and their keezers have full kegs. As I mentioned some slowed down because of life. And maybe yes, because interest is declining they stop seing the point puting out hard work in to content as there is no need for it..\n\nAll in all. I think homebrewing will never die. Its a staple at my home. Its a great hobby. And with technology available these days you can have a 20 minute brew day and have super tasty homebrews. Kits are available. Used equipment is available. Super fast and clean yeasts are available.. All you need is the desire to do it, and to continue doing it..\n\nWhat are your thoughts about it? You still brew? Less, more? Nothing changed?\n\nPlease share!\n\nCheers! \u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\n\nP.S.

{"title": "Keg Ferment. Fining, Cold Crashing, and Dry Hopping .", "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI have been scouring the forums and haven\u02bbt really found the answer I am looking for about order of operations for fining, dry hopping, and cold crashing, and a lot of the discussion seemed about 10 years old. I think a part of this is that there are just many different opinions on the topic and ways to do it that work, but I am curious about what current methods people are using. Basically, I am fermenting an IPA in a keg, and trying to decide on the best order for each of these operations, while introducing the least amount of oxygen as possible. \n\nMy beer has already finished dropping gravity, so dry hopping during full ferment is already out of the question. I did add pellet hops already as a colder whirlpool around 140F and my original plan was to just transfer this into a purged serving keg with more pellets in there. However, when I pulled a gravity reading sample, I also tasted it and noticed a strong polyphenol and hop burn flavor, which made me think that gelatin fining would be a good idea to try and drop some of that out. \n\nThe question is what would be the best way to do this and still get some fresh hop flavor into the beer? \n\nI have seen some cases where people use a CO2 filled bottle to inject gelatin into the keg and that seems pretty easy to set up, but would fining the beer and then putting it onto more hop pellets in the serving keg ruin the point of fining in the first place? I do have Flotit 2.0 floating dip tubes on both the ferm keg and the serving keg. \n\nAnother option is to put the gelatin in the serving keg, which would help me from having to inject it as the gelatin could just be in the purged keg. I have to say that I don\u02bbt love the idea of the serving keg having a mass of gelatin at the bottom though. Mostly because moving it might stir it up and I guess there is also the joy of having just beer and maybe hops in the finished beer. \n\nAs far as cold crashing, it seems there are also different methods. I have read the brulosophy experiment https://brulosophy.com/2015/01/05/the-gelatin-effect-exbeeriment-results/. It seems to me that a cold crash just before fining is the way to go. If I go that route then it seems to rule out gelatin in the serving keg. \n\nAnyway, what is your preferred methodology or what would you recommend to me for this beer and/or future beers? \n\n  \nMy goals are: \n\n1. Clearish beer (Doesn\u02bbt need to be perfect, just don\u02bbt want it yeasty) \n\n2. Not too astringent (harsh bitter flavors/polyphenols) \n\n3. No oxygenation (I have killed my past IPAs this way, so I am a little paranoid)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jhinu6/keg_ferment_fining_cold_crashing_and_dry_hopping/", "created_utc": 1742677483.0, "score": 1, "author": "Dripping_Champagne", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jhinu6/keg_ferment_fining_cold_crashing_and_dry_hopping/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Experiment - Re-use spent dryhops for bittering another batch", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm planning an experiment soon: I want to use spent hops from a small dry hop addition in my last brew as the bittering addition for my next batch. This Friday, I'll be brewing 25 liters of lager, aiming for 21 IBUs. Before fermentation, I'll split the batch into two 12.5 L portions to ferment them with different yeasts. One of the batches will also receive a flameout addition to reach approximately 30 IBUs (91\u00b0C, 10 minutes).\n\nThe dry hop blend consisted of 9g Cryo Citra (23% alpha acid) and 18g Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9% alpha acid). After cold crashing, I collected the spent hops in a hop sock, pressed them slightly, and ended up with a crumbly hop mass weighing 45g.\n\nThe key question now is: How can I estimate the remaining alpha acids in this spent hop mass? To explore this, I conducted a sensory test and also developed a workflow with ChatGPT. I'll share the details below. I\u2019ve also included credible sources, particularly the study *\"Investigating the potential for re-using 'spent' dry-hops in the brew kettle.\"*\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts\u2014do my assumptions make sense, or is there anything you\u2019d add? Of course, I'll share my results once the beer is finished.\n\nThanks a lot, and cheers! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter sleeping on it, I think the numbers generated by ChatGPT are mostly nonsense, and there was likely a calculation error as well. It all feels too much like a shot in the dark with too many unknowns. I think it would be wise to rely on one of two methods:\n\n1.) Using the numbers from the study, though we don\u2019t know exactly what the spent hops looked like\u2014were they still wet, or were they pressed like mine? That would certainly impact the remaining alpha acids.\n\n2.) Relying on my sensory test\u2014this result is probably the better reference in any case.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll go with 50 %, as it aligns with my sensory test. I\u2019ll also taste the wort every 20 minutes or so to get a better sense of whether it needs more or not. That would mean\u00a0**7.5 % Alpha Acids**, which, according to Brewfather, translates to\u00a0**27 grams at 60 minutes**\u00a0for\u00a0**21 IBUs**.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the workflow I worked out with ChatGPT:\n\n# 1. Initial Situation:\n\nA **25-liter batch** with **21 IBU** is being brewed. The boil volume is 30 liters, brewed with a Grainfather G30. The boil time is 60 minutes. After boiling, the batch will be split in half. 12.5 liters of wort will then be increased to **30 IBU** with an aroma addition (whirlpool, 91\u00b0C, 10 minutes).\n\nThe bittering hops used are **spent hops from a previous dry hopping** with:\n\n**9 g Citra Cryo (23% alpha acid)**\n\n**18 g Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9% alpha acid)**\n\nThe **spent hops from the previous batch were collected and pressed in a hop bag**. After pressing, **45 g of spent hops** remained \u2013 a moist, crumbly mass.\n\n# 2. Remaining Alpha Acids in Spent Hops\n\nStudies show that after dry hopping, about **52% (industrial scale) to 77% (pilot scale) of the original alpha acids** remain in the spent hops.\n\n*Original source: \"Approximately one-third of the dry-matter composition of hops was lost during dry-hopping regardless of hop variety; however, there was high retention of both \u03b1-acids (77% pilot scale, 52% industrial) and hop essential oil (51% pilot scale, 33% industrial).\" - (Study: \"Investigating the potential for re-using 'spent' dry-hops in the brew kettle\".)*\n\nThe average value here is **64.5%**, but both the pilot-scale experiment (smaller-scale trials) and the sensory experiment (Section 3) suggest that a higher residual value is plausible. Therefore, from Section 3 onward, we assume **70% residual alpha acid**.\n\nThe study's reported residual values most likely refer to **moist spent hops**, as industrial processes typically work directly with the collected spent hops. This matches the condition of the spent hops used in our experiment, so no additional moisture content correction is necessary.\n\n# 3. Sensory Experiment to Estimate Alpha Acid Content\n\nA sensory experiment was conducted to estimate the remaining alpha acid content of the spent hops. Two samples were prepared with **100 ml of boiling water each**:\n\n* **Sample 1:** 1 g Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9% alpha acid)\n* **Sample 2:** 1 g Spent Hops Mix\n\nBoth samples were steeped for **10 minutes** and then strained through a tea bag. The temperature at the time of straining was **43\u00b0C**.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n* The **Nelson Sauvin** infusion was slightly darker, smelled spicy, and had an intense bitterness (7/10 on a subjective scale).\n* The **spent hop infusion** was lighter, had a mild vanilla aroma, and exhibited significantly less bitterness (4/10 on the same scale).\n* On another scale where Nelson Sauvin was rated 5, the spent hops were rated around 3.\n\n**Estimation of Alpha Acid Content in Spent Hops:** Based on perceived bitterness, an initial approximation is:\n\n* Ratio from the first scale: 10,9x(4/7)=6,23%\n* Ratio from the second scale:10,9x(3/5)=6,54%\n* Average: **6.39% alpha acid**\n\n**Effect of Steeping Time:** Alpha acid extraction does not occur instantly but requires time and high temperatures. Studies show that:\n\n*At 80\u201390\u00b0C, approximately 50% of bitter compounds are extracted within 15 minutes, whereas at 60\u00b0C, only 20\u201330% dissolve.*\n\n*Original source: \"Influence of Temperature and Time on the Extraction of Bitter Compounds during Wort Boiling\" by Jaskula et al. (2008).*\n\nSince the temperature during the experiment dropped from **100\u00b0C to 43\u00b0C**, the average temperature was closer to **70\u201350\u00b0C** throughout the steeping process. Extraction likely only reached **40\u201350% of the possible bitter compounds**, suggesting that the actual alpha acid content in the spent hops could be **higher than estimated through sensory evaluation**.\n\n**Adjusted Estimate:** Taking extraction rates into account, the actual alpha acid content of the spent hops could range from **8% to 9%**, which aligns well with literature values for remaining alpha acids (52\u201377% of the original content). The original dry-hopping mix contained **Citra Cryo (23%)** and **Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9%)**, yielding a combined alpha acid content of **14.93%**.\n\n# 4. Comparison of Sensory Estimation and Theoretical Values\n\nThe sensory estimate suggested **6.39% alpha acid**. Given the applied time and temperature, an extraction efficiency of **45%** was assumed, leading to an actual value of **9.28% alpha acid**.\n\nOn the other hand, theoretical calculations suggest that if **70% of the original alpha acids** remain (based on study data), the residual alpha acid content would be **10.45%**. The difference between these values is only **1.17%**.\n\nThus, for future calculations, an **average residual alpha acid content of 9.87%** is used.\n\n# 5. Calculation of Spent Hop Amount for Desired Bitterness\n\nTo achieve **21 IBU** in the total wort (25 liters final volume), spent hops are used. The boil volume is 30 liters, and the hop utilization rate for a **60-minute boil** is estimated at **25%**. The spent hops have a residual alpha acid content of **9.87%**.\n\nThe required total alpha acid amount to achieve 21 IBU is calculated as:\n\nThe required amount of spent hops is then calculated as:\n\n**Additional Bitterness for Half of the Wort to 30 IBU (Brewfather Estimate):** Since the wort is split into two equal halves (**12.5 liters each**), one half should be increased to **30 IBU** using a hop addition at **91\u00b0C for 10 minutes**.\n\n**According to Brewfather, the remaining spent hops (23.7 g) are sufficient to reach the target bitterness of 30 IBU in the second half of the wort.**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* **21.3 g spent hops** in the 30-liter boil volume provide **21 IBU** in the final 25-liter wort.\n* To increase **one half to 30 IBU**, **23.7 g spent hops** can be used at **91\u00b0C for 10 minutes**.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jdplem/experiment_reuse_spent_dryhops_for_bittering/", "created_utc": 1742250043.0, "score": 9, "author": "tombufry", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jdplem/experiment_reuse_spent_dryhops_for_bittering/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Belgian Yeast Temperature Debacle (accidental m47 overheating)", "selftext": "Hey everyone. So I'm a fan of Belgian styles, and I went to make my tried and true belgian blonde recipe which I know and love. However in my most recent batch I made a slight mistake trusting an old tape-on thermometer instead of my usual candy thermometer, and pitched my yeast (M47) at about 26-27 degrees C instead of what I was aiming for, around 22-24. I didn't notice this slip up until about a day later at which point it was already vigorously fermenting, and the temperature free-rose up to 28C. I've since moved the fermentor into a cooler part of my kitchen in hopes of slightly recovering from that, but... is there any cause for concern? It smells a bit more... thin and cider-ey than my previous batches with the same recipe, and I know it's definitely too early to judge any tasting (it's still only been fermenting for 2 days or so) but it seems mostly ok, though definitely... homebrew-alcohol tasting, which I didn't get in my earlier batches.\n\n  \nAll of this is really just to ask, how important is temperature regulation at the start of fermentation, and is it worth trying to cool down my fermentor now, or do I risk stalling out the yeast?

{"title": "Foaming and Frustration", "selftext": "And yet, another post about beer foaming. I am frustrated that I can\u2019t figure this one out. I\u2019ve read articles, and watched videos. Most people say it comes down to too much pressure, or temperature. But, when you really keep listening or reading, there are a bunch of different reason including an unbalanced system.\n\nFirst, the system \u2013 I have 3 kegs in an old refrigerator that I keep at about 39/40F (4.4C). One keg is for carbonated water, and since it doesn\u2019t foam it\u2019s not an issue. The other two kegs are for beer. All three are connected to flow-control Nukataps via 3/16\u201d beer line.\n\nI have a Co2 manifold with three outputs to feed the kegs \u2013 each output has an individual pressure gauge. I like Belgian style beers and with the carbonated water I wanted the ability to control pressure to the individual kegs.\n\nI originally setup Keg-1 at \\~12psi, and Keg-2 at \u00a0\\~18-psi. This is inline with what most carbonation show as 2.5vols of Co2 for Keg-1, and 3.0vols of Co2 for Keg-2 at 40F (4.4C)\n\nI then used some calculators to balance the system and arrived at 10-Feet for Keg-1, and 15-Feet for Keg-2. I realize that there is some discrepancy between calculators, but I think this is close. I was hoping that with the flow rate taps I could tweak for small variations on-the-fly.\n\nThe problem is that all I get is foam, regardless of flow rate, or which keg I try to draw from. I\u2019ve measured the temperature of the beer in the glass and get a reading of 40F (4.4C), which is the same as the fridge. It\u2019s currently about 40F (4.4C) in my garage so this does not appear to be an issue of a first beer pour. Regardless, all subsequent pours are also all foam.\n\nIf I dial down the flow control to barely a trickle (1minute to \u201cpour\u201d a glass)?\u00a0 Foam.\u00a0 If I open it up? Foam. And this isn\u2019t foam as it hits the glass. It is foam coming out of the tap before it even touches the glass (again, regardless of flow rate).\n\nI\u2019ve since dropped the pressure in both kegs to under 10psi. Still get foam and now I feel like my beers are also under-carbonated, but that could be subjective since they are foaming so badly there isn\u2019t much Co2 left in the glass after a pour.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve got it dialed in on paper, and I\u2019ve tried different pressures, different beers/kegs, but all I get is constant foam. I understand that poor connections can cause this, but I find it hard to believe I have two bad connections (there is no Co2 or liquid leaking as far as I can tell). I don\u2019t see bubbles in the lines during a pour. I also find it hard to believe that I am over-pressurized as I\u2019ve got more than enough line and have dropped pressure to under 10psi, though it\u2019s entirely possible that the gauges on my manifold are off (how do you test?). But, I am open to the idea that I am missing some crucial element and would greatly appreciate some suggestions or insight for troubleshooting the issue from someone far more experienced than I am.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMuch appreciated, and have a cold one for me\u2026.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jc9sxs/foaming_and_frustration/", "created_utc": 1742086421.0, "score": 3, "author": "apriliarider", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jc9sxs/foaming_and_frustration/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The Sap Riseth.", "selftext": "I made an invention last year which to cut a long story short is basically birch sap hop water. Now, I'll spare you the story but basically just say it's probably one of the best Innovations I've made and can't find anywhere on the internet as a thing. Anyway I say this again now because the sap is currently fully flowing but only will be for a few weeks max here in Scotland. Times will vary depending on where you live. If you want to try it tapping trees is fairly simple. I bought some antique aluminium taps that you can bang in and hang a demi John on to, but basically you're drilling a hole in a birch tree at a sight upwards angle and collecting the sap. I'm sure perforating a bit of beer line securely pushed in would work just as well. Simply choose reasonably mature trees 6 inch diameter and wait. I tapped 8 trees last night and this morning had almost 5 gallons. \n\nMy process is to heat the sap to about 90c to pasteurize then hop at about 30g per standard batch once it's dropped to 75 then let it cool. Then optionally add more dry hop or hop essence if desired.\n\nThe residual sweetness adds a real bonus and the mouthfeel and head retention from all the minerals is fantastic and really pushes it up to the level of great alcohol free beer. \n\nThis year I'm going to experiment with small amounts of roast malt and crystal malt for a bit more beer flavour, but if anyone is interested in more information or to try it if they live near any woods with birch I strongly recommend giving it a try.

{"title": "Help! Keg Ferment Clog", "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI was hoping this wouldn't be the title of my first post here, but here goes. I am urgently reaching out for suggestions. I've been going through a lot of the posts on this forum and others, and have recently decided to rebuild my brewing setup using a keg for fermentation.  \n\nI built my desired setup for now with a flotit 2.0 floating dip tube, Maxheadroom gas fitting, and a gas QD going to some PVC line and out into a jar of starsan. I have seen many folks suggest this. I was hoping to add a spunding valve to this after the ferm slowed a bit to naturally carb. \n\nAfter a couple of days of rip-roaring fermentation, I noticed today (day 3) that some krausen had made its way into the tubing and it is now somewhat clogged (being pushed along very slowly by the CO2 output). I tried to release a little out of the PRV (I did this very slowly based on others horror stories). I did not get an explosion but I did get a lot of pressure trying to escape and eventually more yeasty krausen coming out. Now I am trying to figure out the best way to unclog this whole situation and get back to some resemblance of finishing the ferm for this beer while not leaving the yeast under a crazy amount of pressure or introducing too much oxygen. Should I just fully vent the PRV yeast and then clean/reassemble the gas post and QD to hose line? \n\nRecipe is a 4.5 gal IPA w/ roughly 10 lb of grain, and 12 oz of added sugar.. \n\nI did add the recommended amount of fermcap both to the boil and to the keg before yeast pitch. I do wonder if the added sugar just set the yeast off or if doing an IPA like this should be done at 4gal. I also added about 1.5 oz of hops at 150 degrees while cooling the wort, so there is definitely a good amount of hop sludge and possible hop creep contributing. \n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and I guess this kind of forced me to be part of the conversation, which I was hoping to join anyway, albeit with a more successful story.   \n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j9zfe3/help_keg_ferment_clog/", "created_utc": 1741825852.0, "score": 2, "author": "Dripping_Champagne", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j9zfe3/help_keg_ferment_clog/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I don't like the taste of carafa special 1, I think...", "selftext": "I'm trying to figure out whether I just don't like the taste of carafa special 1 or if there is something in my process or in my recipes that I just don't like. I've made two beers now using the CS1 malt, and both have had a kind of taste that I don't really care for . A kind of astringency or bitterness that I can't really figure out where it comes from (somewhere between, astringent, peppery, chemical, or clove like, and mouth puckering). It might be part of the yeast character, or it may be the malt itself. What makes me a bit confused is that  \n1) I used two different yeasts, S04 in a brown ale and Lallemand Munich Classic for a Dunkles Weizen. So maybe it's the CS1, since that is the common factor?  \n2) I had a similar astringency in a Belgian blonde I made with WB-06, and that was definitely the yeast, since it didn't have anything in it besides pilsner malt and white sugar. So maybe it's the yeast, since all three yeast types are somewhat related (I think? At least the Belgian and the Weizen yeasts). And maybe I'm not treating the yeasts quite right. The S04 was fermented towards the higher end, while the Munich Classic was towards the lower end.  \n3) But then again, the brown actually mellowed out over time, and became decent after about two months in the bottle. (The Dunkles Weizen is not there yet, and this remains to be seen). Whereas the blonde did not mellow out substantially (maybe a little bit).\n\nSo what I'm asking is whether you guys have any experience with this in relation to CS1 malt? \n\nI might try to make an experimental batch to test it out. 3 or 4% of CS1 together with simple pilsner malt, and fermented with US-05, which I know how to handle well. Don't know what type of beer that is, but it should be simple enough that I can manage to isolate the CS1 character from the rest of the ingredients.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j7aywc/i_dont_like_the_taste_of_carafa_special_1_i_think/", "created_utc": 1741536817.0, "score": 0, "author": "Waaswaa", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j7aywc/i_dont_like_the_taste_of_carafa_special_1_i_think/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

First of all, do you have to take the clamps apart and clean everything individually, or would doing a CIP through the system after brew day and leaving everything connected be sufficient?\n\nSecondly, would ball valves on the tees be alright (https://a.co/d/cGfwKoc), or should I go the butterfly valve route? (https://a.co/d/6HHgVoM and https://a.co/d/3xnkyiO)\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j66s38/hard_piping_aio_system_tc_suggestions/", "created_utc": 1741400019.0, "score": 1, "author": "Vanilla-prison", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j66s38/hard_piping_aio_system_tc_suggestions/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Lukr faucet leaking from tip", "selftext": "Hey folks! I finally pulled the trigger on a lukr faucet for my home kegerator. The pour of my czech dark lager out of that sucker was delightful. There\u2019s just one problem: the very tip of faucet has a slow drip drip drip. It gets worse the more I open the flow control dimmer tab on the side. I ensured that each connection was firmly secured (threading to draft tower; threading on shank, respectively). The one weird thing is that even though the threads were securely fastened, for some reason, I could (if I wanted to) turn the entirety of the faucet. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the case. The way the faucet attaches to the tower is really weird. It\u2019s as if the thread on the tower has to stretch outward more than a typical perlick faucet, if that makes any sense. Yes, I have the US adapter on the shank of the lukr faucet.\n\nSo, I\u2019m not sure where the leak is coming from. Has anyone else observed this issue, and if so, what was the solution? Thanks and cheers.\n\nEDIT: so I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I reassembled and re-installed the lukr faucet, this time attempting to fasten the threads on the shank and the tower respectively with all my might. I then tested the flow control knob fully closed and fully open. By doing this, I achieved zero dripping. KEY TAKEAWAY: whereas with your traditional faucets, you don\u2019t have to fasten them super tight, with the lukr faucets\u2026.skip back and bis, and then fasten super tight, all the while making sure you\u2019re not bending anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j5lr7k/lukr_faucet_leaking_from_tip/", "created_utc": 1741348379.0, "score": 8, "author": "Prestigious-Ad-5820", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j5lr7k/lukr_faucet_leaking_from_tip/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I've never managed to get the starting gravity just right,but it is usually close enough that I don't stress about it. This time it was so low, I added almost 2kg of sugar to bring the SG up to the suggested level. I added the yeast, put the lid on the fermenter, and into the hot press it went.

{"title": "ATACC. My creation after 2 years of development", "selftext": "Hello all, I just want to share what I've been working on. I call it \"ATACC\" or to be more specific the \"Automated Temperature And Coolant Controller\". It's a one size fits all control system that will automate essentially any still of any size wether it's a diy still or a commercial made one. It adapts in real time and can deal with a variety of things from unstable water pressure to power failures. I am currently working various hardware addons for fully automated cuts and emergency shutdown relays. To install it all you have to do is put it in between your water supply and your still (there are two 1/4 barb fittings on each side that you just connect your water to one end and the still to the other. Then just slot the thermal probe into wherever you want to measure, all without the need for any tools.) there is also an optional web interface where you can configure and control every aspect of how ATACC behaves and fine tune it for your specific setup as this device can work on pretty much anything assuming you configure it properly. There are currently around 10 prototypes in circulation being used with testers from simple T500 all the way up to large scale 65L and 100L stills and all seem to be reporting overwhelmingly positive feedback. I guess the reason I'm making this post is because I want to hear from you guys what would you want this device to be capable of assuming you had one. What questions do you have for me? If you want I can show videos of it doing a full distillation start to finish when operating on less than ideal conditions. I'll try and answer to the best of my abilites. going forward I will continue support via software updates and eventually make an entire ecosystem of hardware and software around ATCC.\n\nIve included images and more in depth documentation about what it is, what its capable of and how it works at the link below. there is simply no way I can explain everything in a single post.\nhttps://migdynamics.ca/pages/guides-and-tutorials\n\nTLDR: what do you think?

{"title": "keg options", "selftext": "So I was wondering what the community's opinions are on the small .5 to 2.5 gallon kegs you can get on Amazon for about $90 for the whole kit with a regulator and spigot and about $45 for just the keg, like this one: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HM7KL2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HM7KL2) Looks like there's another part with the ball locks on top that would be necessary to fill the keg.  The biggest down side I see is the need to remove the filling and serving devices and screw on caps, but If it was purged with CO2 I don't see oxygen being a big problem.  A secondary downside is that everything out there seems to use screw-on CO2 cartridges, which are considerably more expensive than the usual ones.\n\nI bought 4 corny's last week from a warehouse over in Bakersfield that had 11 pallets of them from a kombucha company that went out of business.

Now of course I'm replacing the O-rings and the little sniglets on the bail that help set the pressure the lid seals with.  Three of them had the second gas port and a diffusion \"stone\".  \n\nBut beyond the forced carbonation and bottling with a beer gun, I don't have a Keezer yet.  I do have a separate fridge out in the shop that's used for storing extra food but also industrial stuff like keeping epoxies and silicones cold to inhibit curing, and it's a dual door fridge, so not an ideal conversion to beer use anyway.

{"title": "Steam Condenser Question", "selftext": "Hi folks, I recently bought a steam condenser to make my indoor electric brew days a little less humid, and after some issues with connectors that got sorted out with the help of the maker, I got it hooked up to do a water and leak test today. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem: At my full water pressure, the sprayer put out 5 gallons in 4m40s, almost 70gph!!!\n\nObviously, it shouldn\u2019t be run at full pressure, but at the lowest adjustment on my water line that gave me a good, cone shaped spray, it was still outputting over 20gph, way more water than I am comfortable wasting. Any lower on my water supply and I could only get a stream, or a very coarse, narrow spray. \n\nThe valve on my water supply isn\u2019t very sensitive, so the adjustment between that cone shaped spray and a stream/trickle is only about a mm. \n\nI emailed the manufacturer to ask about getting a return and they suggested that I just run it at a trickle, but I thought steam condensers worked by creating a massive amount of cold mist/surface area to condense the steam. \n\nMy question is: Will a stream/trickle that isn\u2019t a fine mist or spray work effectively? \n\nI\u2019m willing to admit I\u2019m wrong if I am as this is my first experience using a steam condenser, so let me know if I need to eat some crow.

{"title": "Would you kindly look over my braggot recipes please? I am a beginner at beer", "selftext": "--Sorry in advance for the long post, but the majority of it is two recipes I would like you to look over--\n\nHello! I have been making meads and wines occasionally for the past few years, with several successful batches under my belt (and a few not-so-successful batches as well). I would very much like to get into the beer brewing space, and I thought that bridging the gap with a braggot would be a reasonable place to start.\n\nWith that in mind, I am planning on making a couple 5 gallon batches based on recipes I found online. The first of which is Doin' The Most's [Wampus Cat braggot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlJQm1VSGGk&t=579s). The second is what is called the [Jutland Braggot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/7kxrqv/braggot_recipes_beermead_hybrids/), which I found on Reddit. \n\nI have typed up recipes based on what I saw in the Doin the Most video, and will provide them below. \n\n**My request is thus:** Please tell me if anything here seems off, or if quantities seem off (I am thinking the Jutland uses way more honey and malt extract than the Wampus Cat, which would make for a much bigger beer, right? At least in ABV? Also, if you have any tips for me, they would be much appreciated.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n#**5 Gallon Wampus Cat**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb honey malt\n* 1.5 oz Centennial hops\n* 4.5 lbs wildflower honey\n* 1.5 lbs buckwheat honey \n* Spring Water to 5 gallons\n* Kveik Voss ale yeast -- Rehydrate Yeast with GoFerm. The ratio needed is 1.25x Go-Ferm then multiply that by 20 to get the amount of water. \n* 1 whirl floc tablet\n* Muslin Bag, for mash\n* Nylon brew bag, as I don't have a hop spider\n\nInstructions:\n\nBREW DAY:\n\n* SANITIZE EVERYTHING\n* Measure Ingredients\n* In a stockpot, steep honey malt in 1.5 gallons of spring water at 150-155\u00b0F for an hour. This is easiest when using a brewing bag to hold your grains\n* Strain out grains, rinse them with spring water, squeeze the bag, and discard them\n* Bring water to a boil. \n* 0.5 oz of centennial hops goes in inside the brew bag at the beginning of the boil, rest goes in after 45 minutes of boiling with 1 whirlfloc tablet\n* While boil is going, add honey to brew bucket\n* After 60 minutes, kill flame \n*Strain out hops bag\n* Allow brew to cool down a fair ways\n* While still warm, pour brew mash into ferm bucket with honey\n* Stir to combine\n* Top up to 5 total gallons of volume\n* Pitch Kveik yeast\n\nONGOING:\n\nCheck Gravity every day\n\nOnce it stops fermenting or hits 1.000, rack to secondary\n\nOnce in secondary, add sparkolloid to help it clear up\n\nOnce clear, rack onto priming sugar, then bottle that day\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n#5 Gallon Jutland Braggot Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 6 lbs Dry Wheat Malt Extract \n* 8-10 lbs Wildflower Honey \n* 2 grams Sweet Gale, aka Bog Myrtle (add to the last 5 minutes of boil) \n* 6 lbs frozen cranberries or 1/2 gallon pure cranberry juice (Knudsen is a good brand) \n* Yeast - Safale T-58 (I'm going to use the remainder of the Kveik yeast, is that ok?)\n\nOptional Ingredients: \n\n* \u00bd lb German Rauch Malt or Peat Smoked Malt crushed (steep the malt for 45 min at 150-155\u00b0F) \n* Hops, such as Hallertauer,Tettnanger, Spalt, or Saaz. These are all German hop varieties and are low in bitterness. About 1oz in the boil would be fine. \n* Herbs such as Heather - 2oz , Meadowsweet - 1/2oz, Yarrow - 1oz or Chamomile - 1oz. Add the herbs at the last 5 min of the boil. \n\nBREW DAY: \n\n* SANITIZE EVERYTHING\n* In a large pot add 2 gallons of water (if you are going to use the smoked malt put it in a grain bag and add it to the water). \n* Bring H20 to 150 degrees F and steep the malt for 45 min. \n* After 45 min. remove the malt. \n* Next add the wheat malt extract to the pot and dissolve. Mix thoroughly and bring to a boil. \n* Add hops at this point if you are going to use them (put into a hop bag if desired). \n* Boil for 60 minutes. \n* At the last 5 minutes, add the bog myrtle or other herbs if you choose to use them - make sure you put them in a mesh bag, also called a hop bag - this will help so you don't have to strain them out and prevent \"floaties'. \n* After everything is boiled, take your pot off the heat and add your honey. Stir until all the honey is dissolved. Stir for 2 minutes. \n* Stop stirring and allow the wort to sit for 10 minutes. \n* Now add your frozen cranberries, this will help cool the wort and pasteurize your berries and use a water bath as necessary. If you choose to use the juice or concentrate, add it to the secondary and use just the water bath to cool your wort. (a water bath is filling your sink with water and ice cubes and putting your pot of wort in it to help cool it faster) \n* Once the wort is at about 85\u00b0F, transfer it to your fermenter. \n* Add enough cold water to equal 5 gallons.\n* If you are using dry yeast, rehydrate yeast in boiled and then cooled to 95 degree water. Let sit 10 minutes, covered. \n* Pitch your yeast when it is about 70 degrees and aerate the wort and let ferment!

{"title": "House Beer Style, French Saison, Brewing Lethargy", "selftext": "I know many of you will have a 'House Beer' that you've always got to hand, but has anyone here found a particular style of beer they brew really well and stuck to it? Maybe you bought a bulk pack of a certain yeast and have been solely brewing riffs of a particular style?\n\nPersonally, I'm feeling an air of lethargy when it comes to brewing, I posted a while ago about being in a funk, bought new gear, went back to basics, reignited the passion, but now I just can't be bothered to mess around with recipes and water additions for 20 different styles any more. I think my lack of passion is leading me to cut corners and produce very average beer. I do the odd shake and brew to experiment and keep the fridge full, but it is a more expensive way of brewing using solely extract and is a bit of a soulless way of brewing, albeit with reasonable to pretty great results, reliable too.\n\nThe thread the other day about a French Saison recipe reminded me that this is a style I have always loved brewing and drinking, and it's a style that always just seems to 'work' for me, I've cut every corner possible with M29 yeast and it's never failed me yet, so that's what I'm doing. Once I've run down the rest of my brewing ingredients I'm buying a bulk pack of M29 and that's all I'm going to brew with for a year.\n\nMy baseline recipe is 100% Pils, aiming for between 5 and 6% ABV. Hopped with Saphir & Mittelfruh to 25-30 IBU. I'm going to try the recommended 10% table sugar addition and will experiment with a small dry hop of Saphir for starters. I'll try various unmalted adjunct additions along the way, and some malted wheat and rye too. Maybe I'll try co-fermenting with Belgian strains for some complexity. Might even spike some bottles with Brett and age for fun.\n\nAnyone got any tried and tested hop combos or other variants on a French Saison I should try? Very interested in a good Table Saison recipe around the 3% mark if anyone has a good one.\n\nCheers!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1kc70l7/house_beer_style_french_saison_brewing_lethargy/", "created_utc": 1746100982.0, "score": 15, "author": "Entire_Researcher_23", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1kc70l7/house_beer_style_french_saison_brewing_lethargy/", "html_title": ""}

I have rewritten this to run on what I intended to be cheap and simple to set up, minimal hardware.\n\nI have ported this code to MicroPython and tweaked it a bit. Other than curiosity, my aim was that it should be easy & cheap to build a microcontroller version. This design is based around the Raspberry Pi Pico, no soldering required, \u00a3/$/\u20ac6-ish for the microcontroller board, plus the cost of a USB power supply and a micro USB cable. Drag and drop one file and edit one text file to get up and running.\n\nI then got a bit carried away and created the option of adding a display screen, which also requires no soldering, but sort of triples the cost. Then I made myself a 3D printed case. Any option works, just using a Pico board is the cheapest and easiest way to get set up. Some images, more information & code at [https://github.com/jef41/tilt-micro-bridge](https://github.com/jef41/tilt-micro-bridge)\n\nA big potential drawback is that I have only so far integrated Grainfather support and CSV local logging, because that is what I use. If there is a wider interest it should be fairly straightforward to add other integrations like Brewfather, I just don't use those, so I cannot easily test. If you have an interest in some other integration let know.\n\nI know I am late to the party on this, aside from the official app and Raspberry Pi image there are plenty of other integrations, [TiltBridge](https://tiltbridge.readthedocs.io/en/master/) using an ESP32 microcontroller, [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tilt_ble/) to name a couple.

{"title": "Advice: First ever home brew was BAD.", "selftext": "I tried my hand at home brewing with a one gallon starter kit from Northern Brewer with a pale ale recipe. There were two main issues with the beer which made it virtually undrinkable:\n\n1. It was dark. It was supposed to be a pale ale but oh boy was it not pale. I think this also made it have a quite intense taste; very \u201choppy\u201d in a sense. What made it so dark? Did I not boil it long enough or mix it enough or something?\n\n2. There was little to no carbonation. I bought glass bottles with a \u201cpop top\u201d cap for reusability, and so I think it was a combination of bad brewing and weak seal on the bottles. Is there any way to strengthen the seal or do I just need to get a bottling kit with \u201cnormal\u201d bottle caps? \n\n3. With the carbonation, the instructions said to add sugar as food for the yeast when the beer was bottled but my dad said that would negatively affect the taste. Instead, we used ~2 Tbsp of excess malt to complete the fermentation in the bottles. Next time should I stick to the recipe and do the sugar? Or is it common to do the malt instead?\n\nFor my next attempt, I really want it to come out well. How can I address these issues? And also, is Northern Brewer a good company to get ingredients from? Should I try a different recipe, or get the ingredients separately, or try a different company?\n\nI wasted 4 weeks for a disgusting beer and I really just want my next batch to be at least slightly palatable!

Resulting in a bitterness around 26 IBU.\n\nSplit the wort in two equal portions in kegs, and respectively pitched one pack of Diamond Lager and S-189 in 18C (\\~64F) wort and fermented under pressure at 20C (68F) at 15 psi for the first three days and at 32 psi for the remaining 11 days until cold crashing.\n\nThe resulting beers were great after two weeks of lagering. The Diamond Lager dropped crystal clear on itself while the S-189 was still very hazy, so I added some gelatin to that keg and the issue was resolved in 2 days. Both beers finished around 5.3% abv (81% attenuation)\n\nDiamond Lager seemed to be more... \"lagery\" than the S-189 batch. I don't know how to describe it, perhaps it is more of a certain ester. It also was a lot more rounded, with a light crackery finish.\n\nS-189 was a lot less expressive, more 'clean' but the malt profile in this beer was a lot more nuanced and really reminded me of bread crust.\n\nIn both beers the Saaz was there, but quite muted. In the S-189 batch I felt it was a bit brighter but that could just be me.\n\nAll in all, I kinda prefered the S-189 because I love a bit more rustic malt character in lagers. Next time I'll perhaps even increase the biscuit and/or melanoidin in this recipe. \n\nSince i've been doing no-chill really it seems that just dry-hopping seems to have significant impact on hoppiness.

Most of my beers are low to medium OG (1.035-1.050).   \n\n\nI do BIAB inside the anvil basket. For the higher OG recipes, I sparge. For lower OG recipes, I do not.

All used BIAB with sparging. No significant variations in water temps or volumes. All received similar water treatments of calcium chloride and lactic acid adjustments to 5.35 ph calculated.

Is there anything about using large quantities of flaked oats that can cause efficiency issues? The mash was pretty thick, at around 1.45 lbs/qt, but it seemed reasonable. In the first and third batch I had less malted oats than the second batch, but I did add some rice hulls. I know rice hulls are not strictly needed for BIAB, but my thought was without them the oats might turn into a blob.\n\nMy thought for next time is to significantly reduce the oat percentage and compensate with increased malt. I'm still curious why I got such different results from the second batch. Obviously there could be any number of issues wrong with my process, or things I don't track and am not aware of. The sparge definitely drained a bit more slowly than I am used to, so I thought that perhaps insufficient rice hulls or too thick of a mash was causing issues. I'm open to any other ideas or thoughts. \n\nI mill my own grain with a consistent size, treat the water similarly, it's all grain bought within the last few months, and other styles (pilsners, munich dunkels, hefeweizen, etc.) tend to show consistent BHE admittedly at lower OGs. It's worth pointing out that a lower OG recipes with a similar proportion to above also missed target OG by 10%, so it seems to be a trend with these specific recipes. \n\n(My recipes with a large % of Munich also tend to get lower efficiency, but they are consistent with one another.)\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k9g419/low_efficiency_on_neipas/", "created_utc": 1745792240.0, "score": 2, "author": "spoonman59", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k9g419/low_efficiency_on_neipas/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

When I got around to kegging it, the FG reading came out at *1.002* (per the recipe it should have been 1.021), so ABV around 2-3%.\n\nSecond time, I decided to pay a bit closer attention - repeated the same process, OG was 1.020. Lower efficiency than the recipe, but whatever. By day two, we were at 1.014, and today on day seven it's 1.004.\n\nCan anyone spot what's going wrong here? With a mash temp of 79\u00b0C and maltotriose negative yeast, it seems wild to me that I'm getting apparent attenuation of 80-90%!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k93c5f/low_abv_what_went_wrong/", "created_utc": 1745758607.0, "score": 3, "author": "Eodyr", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k93c5f/low_abv_what_went_wrong/", "html_title": ""}

I usually use a hop spider.\n\nInitially it took a while to get to a vigorous boil which almost made me take it out as I was concerned about the wort not circulating - but it did get to an acceptable boil so that part was fine.\n\nI brewed a 27 L batch with 26g of hops. \n\nAt the end of the boil, I transferred the wort to my fermenter and turned off the pump when I got to a trickle coming out of the counterflow chiller and the fermenter looked full. \n\nWhat I realise now, when cleaning up, is that the hop plate is almost completely clogged with hop debris. That wouldn\u2019t be an issue if the outlet below the hot plate was clear, but that is also clogged with hop matter.\n\nThe consequence of this is that there is about 1.5 L of hot wort left in my Grainfather which I was not aware of and could not transfer to my fermenter as I assumed the trickle meant that there was no more hot wort. In addition, the hop plate obscures my vision of the outlet pipe so wasn\u2019t able to tell until I was at the cleaning stage.\n\nAnd OMG the amount of burnt sugars on the bottom of the unit is unreal.

{"title": "Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout with gravity that is way off", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nPretty new to the homebrewing game, long time lurker ;).\n\nLast month, we attempted to brew an Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout (based on [this recipe](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/402144/imperial-chocolate-milk-stout-50l-)).\n\nWe ran into a few problems. First, the recipe mentions lactose twice, once under 'fermentables' and once under 'other ingredients'. We loaded the recipe into our Brewmonk B40 via BeerXML, and it showed up twice there too. Since it's exactly the same amount both times, I suspect it's a mistake in the recipe, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlso, our starting gravity was too low, and the final gravity way too high. We started at 1.066 (instead of 1.082) and ended at 1.028 instead of 1.012. Fermentation seemed to finish way too quickly\u2014after 5 days, nothing was happening anymore.

Finer milling?\n* We added the yeast when the wort was still too warm.\n* Maybe the yeast was too cold\u2014not taken out of the fridge early enough?\n\nVery curious what you all think.\n\nFor those interested, I try to make a video of each brew day - here\u2019s the [video of our first attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PZyswStB1g) (It's in Dutch though!)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k6r918/imperial_chocolate_milk_stout_with_gravity_that/", "created_utc": 1745498596.0, "score": 1, "author": "florianvo", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k6r918/imperial_chocolate_milk_stout_with_gravity_that/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "De La Senne Yeast", "selftext": "I posted a few days ago about K-97, which is apparently a very polarising yeast, but it led me down a rabbit hole of hoppy Belgian ales, Taras Boulba & Zinnebir particularly. I've had the pleasure of drinking Taras Boulba albeit a long time ago and very much enjoyed it, and the style.\n\nI think it's common knowledge that they use, or at least used to use, two well known dried yeast strains. Their beer isn't as phenolic as other Belgian yeasts and Yvan De Baets is heavily inspired by British ales. I've seen suggested that K-97 could be one of the two yeasts, it fits with the assertive bitterness and the lingering aftertaste I've seen associated with De La Senne beers and also the fine powdery sediment in their bottles. \n\nDoes anyone have more concrete evidence of this, any other suggestions? Or what could the second strain be? I've seen T-58, S-33 & even Belgian Wit yeasts suggested.\n\nI'm not looking to clone Taras, just emulate some of the character of De La Senne, which I know in part will come down to their water profile too.

Those changes have made a marked improvement in the quality of the beer but have failed to address the high final gravity.\n\nQuestion to those who know better:\nWhat\u2019s the next move?\n\nAeration - I\u2019ve been using an air stone and pumping air into it. Could a local of oxygen be the problem?\n\nFermenting Vessels - I\u2019m using plastic buckets without any insulation.

{"title": "Using liquor to extract barrel notes", "selftext": "I feel like I may be overthinking things, but I wanted to run this by the hivemind\u2026\n\nWhen homebrewing, I usually use liquor in one of two ways:\n\n* To add flavors in the form of a tincture (vanilla beans in bourbon, citrus zest in gin or vodka, etc.)\n* To \u201csanitize\u201d, but also to impart more spirit flavor into wood (soaking an oak wood spiral in bourbon for some time before adding it to the fermenter)\n\nIn thinking about these two practices, I want to discuss the method of imparting wood & spirit notes to a brew (point number 2):\n\nIn point number 1 above, I will soak an addition in the spirit for some time and then add it to the beer at packaging.  The addition is disposed of because presumably I have extracted most of the flavor available given the timeframe I soaked the addition.  The liquid tincture is the thing of value.\n\nHowever, when preparing to \u201cwood condition\" a beer using my method in point number 2, I soak a wood spiral in a spirit and then dispose of the spirit.  Would it be more impactful to my beer to toss out the wood after being soaked and then add the wood-note-filled spirit instead?  (Or perhaps add the spirit at packaging but also continue with the wood conditioning as I currently do it?)\n\nI guess my question is this:  When I soak a wood spiral in liquor, what is happening more: the wood having absorb spirit notes or the spirit taking on wood notes?\n\nFor example, I will be making a margarita-flavored gose soon and I want to add some tequila notes using an oak spiral.

Stirring now and then.\n\nI then ground the dried grains in a food processor as fine as possible. \n\nI proceeded to making my bread in which 10% of the floor would be substituted for the spent grain flour. That was:\n\n- 360 mL of water\n\n- 10g of salt\n\n- 450g of gluten rich flour\n\n- 50g of spent grain flour\n\n- 14g of dried yeast \n\nThrew everything in my bread maker on \u00ab\u00a0dough\u00a0\u00bb settings.\n\nTransferred then into a rectangular tray, let it rise a second time and then baked it in the oven at 230C leaving at the bottom a tray with boiling water to get a nice crust without drying the bread.\n\nIt turned out great. It tastes more bready that my normal bread, can pick up some melanoidin, some maltiness and a touch of sweetness in the back. \n\nLooking forward experimenting with other grain bills!\n\nHere are some pictures:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/roPIVqs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k36dt3/i_made_bread_with_spent_grains/", "created_utc": 1745096861.0, "score": 67, "author": "timscream1", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1k36dt3/i_made_bread_with_spent_grains/", "html_title": ""}

Even better, if you\u2019d be open to chatting about your setup (or maybe even meeting up sometime to share ideas, visit breweries and just making connections), I\u2019d really appreciate it! I'm 36m if that changes peoples mind haha!\n\nOne of my longer-term goals is to eventually start a homebrewing club in my area, since I know there are quite a few folks interested in it around here.

{"title": "Very high OG all grain", "selftext": "Morning all!\n\nI had a good brew day yesterday doing a SMaSH beer with Ella hops. I currently do 5l stove top batches and whilst everything went to plan, I had one stumbling block which I hope I resolved but wanted some advice. \n\nI took a reading with my EasyDens pre-boil and the wort was 1.043, I was 7 points below where I thought I should be at 1.050. Not too concerned but was prepared for a low post boil gravity\u2026\n\nNow this is where it gets interesting, previously I\u2019ve had very low post boil gravities and I think it was because my boil wasn\u2019t vigorous enough. So this time I decided to get a strong rolling boil, which seemed to have worked except that this time my post boil gravity reading came out at 1.081!! I tested multiple times and every time it was the same reading, so I liquor\u2019d it back with about a litre and a half of water to get to my required gravity of 1.059. When testing one final time I ended up at 1.058. \n\nSo, here are my questions - was the 1.081 an accurate reading? I\u2019ve read that you can get odd readings if taking from the top part of the boiling wort - however from what I\u2019ve read this seems to be for extract kits, is this the same for all grain?\n\nSecondly, did I do the right thing by adding the water? \n\nThirdly, how do I reduce this from happening in the future? I\u2019ve gone from low gravity to high gravity by changing the boil off rate - is this the likely cause? \n\nThanks!\n\nTim", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jy2hkg/very_high_og_all_grain/", "created_utc": 1744530531.0, "score": 6, "author": "CorrectResolution649", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jy2hkg/very_high_og_all_grain/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

OGs were around 1.050, and I mashed at around 69C to give the bugs plenty to do. They are all mixed fermentations, in which I started with clean yeasts (Belgian Wit in some, Kveik in others) and added dregs from lambics and other commercial wild sours whenever I could, especially in the initial weeks and months. I also added some Wyeast 3278 Lambic Blend to some of the cubes.\n\nI didn't bother to measure the gravity until 3 months ago (i.e. about 10 months in), and it was the same in all of them as it is now. I added fruit (fresh peaches in one, frozen blueberries in the other) to a couple of the cubes at that time. Activity picked up as the fruit fermented, but now they have settled back to the same gravity as before. This period happened to be summer, and the room temp would have ranged from about 20C to 25C. The beers have been through a winter as well, but that was early on and they were all very active.\n\nAll the cubes have soured and produced varying degrees of Brett character (though interestingly this seems to have faded rather than intensified over time), and mostly of them now taste pretty good. But I am reluctant to bottle with so much residual sugar, even though the gravity seems stable.\n\nIs this timeline normal?

{"title": "Second Homebrew: Altbier recipe - Tasting day", "selftext": "OG: 1040\n\nYeast: SafAle Be-134 mixed with leftover yeast/LAB colony from last batch (which was built on SafAle Be-134)\n\nHops: Hersbrucker 7g added in second half of malting (started from hand-temp, slowly warmed up to 160, then let go for an hour)\n\nStart Date: March 29, 2025\n\nFG: 1002 - April 12th, 2025\n\nGrain Bill: **1.5 lb (680g) German Pilsner Malt** (base malt for crispness) 17\n\n* **0.25 lb (113g) Munich Malt** (adds toasty depth) 12\n* **0.1 lb (45g) Caramunich I** (20-30L, for caramel sweetness) 16\n* **0.05 lb (23g) Chocolate Malt** (adds color without harsh roast; keep under 2% of total grain) 17\n\nHeld at 160 for mash, with slight increases, top 175 but rapidly corrected to 160-165 degrees for the majority of the 60 minute long boil.\u00a0Hops added at 30 minutes.Pitched at 75 degrees. Rapidly cooled in sink/bathtub.Ended up with extra wort, perhaps I should have boiled a bit more water off to have a higher OG, but I'm happy with 1040. With the yield of this yeast, I should get a solid 5% even before priming.\n\nNotes on taste: So for reference, I tried to have AI scale my recipe from a 5 gallon to one gallon, except it cut out the Vienna malt which might have made a difference due to being on the \"search\" function rather than just analyzing the data I put in. Rookie mistake. \n\nIt has a very pleasant, stout-y type character. Slight smokey taste, like burnt grains. Not unpleasant but not what I was expecting. Super dry, which I don't mind. The LAB add a nice, slight sour kick to it that helps mellow out the darkness of the ale. Bit hoppy for my taste, bit more bitter than the last one I made.\n\nI'm gonna let it sit another week for more of the trub to fall out into the bottom before bottle conditioning. It's bone-dry, and I wonder if this isn't because of my putting the grains in the water before it hits malting temps in the 130s or so. \n\nAny advice or pointers regarding this specific style would be great. I like it generally speaking, I just would prefer it to be slightly lighter or sweeter.\n\nI'd like to re-use this yeast cake for an amber of some sort.

{"title": "Flanders Red Solera and Technique", "selftext": "So I've had a Flanders Red solera going for the last 3 years. I love the style and thought this would be a good project where I could slowly evolve the beer with each iteration. \n\nI started the beer by fermenting with US05 and then transferring to a glass carboy. I then added roeselare blend, added the airlock, and waited. I tasted every 2-3 months and after 12 months it still wasn't really sour. I added some bottle dregs (which I forgot to take notes on) and by the 18 month mark gen 1 was ready for bottling. I was pretty happy with it. OK sourness. Great expression from the yeast and bacteria, but lacking a lot of maltiness and malt complexity. Also, lacking oak. Also, quite dry compared to the benchmark - Rodenbach.\n\nSo a added back the 50% I had bottled (I didn't change the recipe as I hadn't tasted the beer yet) and this time I added 1/2 an oak spiral for a week.\n\nGen 2 has now been bottled and it's pretty much just gen 1 but a little more sour and with a little oak. I'm tweaking the recipe to get more malt flavours and complexity. I'll leave it on the oak a little longer. This is all fine. \n\nMy questions (yes, I've finally got there). How do home brewers take their Flanders Reds to the next level? A glass carboy isn't super fantastic for a solera as it doesn't allow the subtle, slow oxygen ingress that a barrel does. Is there any way around this apart from shelling out for an expensive barrel? Also, my beers have been super dry. This is understandable. It's often said that great Flanders Reds are blended. This is fine if you have multiple barrels of flanders fermenting, but is there a way of doing this on a homebrew scale?\n\nFinally, any other tips or suggestions on my project are more than welcome.

I have a few kegs and a single tapping head, although I'm planning to include at least one more to have more variety on tap.\n\nI tried force carbonating the first batch, and it went fine. I'm not a fan of the time it took, especially with just a single serving head. The lead time between emptying a keg and having the next one carbonated wasn't ideal. \n\nI'm familiar with shaking method, but overall I'd rather have my kegs carbonate over time, especially as they sit in storage for quite a while.\n\nMy question is about natural carbonating, especially in PET kegs.

{"title": "Small batch brewing got me into homebrewing! (A young and new beginner homebrewer\u2019s perspective/rant)", "selftext": "Hello everyone! Late Millennial/Gen Z person here, born in 1996, and a very new and enthusiastic homebrewer (started at the beginning of the new year, 5 brews done; 2 extract/partial mash kits and 3 all-grain BIAB SMaSH ales, 5th batch got one week left of fermentation!). It\u2019s been funny coming into the hobby during these past few months with all the \u201chomebrew is dead\u201d discourse. I saw this /u/Clawhammer_Supply post [IAHA Question: How to Attract New Homebrewers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jfo35e/iaha_question_how_to_attract_new_homebrewers/) and I thought it could helpful(?) (annoying? lol) to share what got me interested in brewing!\n\nFew details about me, I have loved craft beer for quite a while. Lived in San Diego during the craft beer boom of the 2010s, read Randy Mosher\u2019s books on beer style/history and homebrewing, Greg Koch\u2019s Stone Brewing book, etc. **Despite** a high general interest in beer, homebrewing always looked unapproachable to me.\n\n**Two major aspects that always turned me off to homebrewing** were the ubiquitous brewing \u201cstandard\u201d of 5 gallons and the \"gear\".\n\nI have neither the thirst for *that* much beer nor the space/money for the equipment. These things are very in line with Gen Z. We\u2019re drinking way less alcohol and don\u2019t have the money or space to spare (3% of homeowners are Gen Z aged). Anytime I\u2019d search homebrewing how-to\u2019s (not beginner tutorials, but stuff like \u201csimple pale ale recipe), everyone is brewing on a 10 gal brewing system that costs +$1000. They\u2019re making +5 gallons of beer, kegging it and serving/storing out of the kegerator in their garage/basement.\n\nBut one day I saw both Clawhammer Supply and Norther Brewer 1 gallon kit videos and that finally inspired me. And also this [\u201cGlen and Friends Cooking\u201d video]( https://youtu.be/HVM6xwbUQmU) on a 1 gallon all-grain batch.\n\nSmall batch brewing and BIAB solved all my issues. By small batch I mean in the range of 1 to 2.5 gallons. 1.25 gallons is the perfect sweet spot for me, as I can easily 1/4th a recipe. And with a brew bag it allows me to brew in my kitchen and use kitchen equipment I already own.\n\nMy first 1 gallon batch from the Northern Brewer kit was perfectly serviceable and but if I had to drink 50-60 bottles of it, I would have not even bothered lol. The benefit of being able to scale down recipes means I get more usage out of my ingredients too, a 10lb bag of grains can go to 4 batches of beer rather than just 1. Things are way more manageable and I get more practice.\n\nI also upgraded to kegging/co2 with a 1.6 gallon Torpedo Keg. It stores nicely in my fridge. I still use the 1.4 gallon fermenter that came from my Northern Brewer kit and that also sits nicely in my kitchen cabinet.\n\n**Rant time**, feel free to comment \u201cshut up kid\u201d after reading this lol\n\nIMO, I think a not-so-insignificant potion of the problem in the decline of newcomers has come from the front-facing media space of the homebrewing community. I don\u2019t want to come off as anti-gear, nor am I talking about any random Youtube homebrewer that has a high tech mini-brewery set up, what I am saying is that given the shifting divide in drinking habits and money/space that Gen Z and future generations experience, those that bemoan the decline of newcomers on \u201chomebrewing Youtube\u201d should consider working alongside that shift.\n\nDon\u2019t just tell them that extract brewing or BIAB exist, show it! Celebrate it as much as all-grain! Don\u2019t make it a one-off video or some list video about \u201ctop 10 cost-effective brewing tips\u201d. LEAD by example. Show how crazy you can get with just a brew bag and stock kettle. Make it part of a regular content schedule alongside the usual 10 gal equipment videos.\n\nTake for instance this recently released Clawhammer Supply video (love the company btw! This is just a critique)\n\n[How to Make a German Pilsner Using the Easy Lager Fermentation Method - Brew Beer at Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QrvHGQruUo)\n\nThe original title for video btw was (had the tab open still when I was writing this post)\n\n>[German Pilsner - Easy Lager Fermentation Method - **How to Make Your First Homemade Beer**]\n\nWhen it was under the original title, is that *really* the video a beginner should see when they search \u201chow to make beer\u201d? They used their \u201c10 Gallon 120V Electric Brew System\u201d It\u2019s a +$1000 brewing system. I get that they are a brewing supply company, but in how world is that \u201cfirst homemade beer\u201d content?? It even says in the video description that it\u2019s a beginner guide to brewing. Insane. Not only that, but they ended up canning the beer?? These sort of contrasts make the cost and accessibility divide very apparent. I think there\u2019s a real flaw in thinking that all homebrewers will *want* to start with or upgrade to some stainless steel brewing system or increase brewing volume.\n\nOf course with any content creation, you\u2019re in a balancing act of \u201cWho is your audience?\u201d They're making content for more serious homebrewers. And I\u2019m not trying to say to pivot to only making 1 gallon extract videos or catering only to beginners and pumping out slop, but let\u2019s expand to all levels of brewing if you\u2019re trying to reinvigorate a supposedly \u201cdying\u201d hobby.\n\nMaybe reintroduce stuff like BIAB regularly to new audiences or make more videos using everyday kitchen equipment that doesn\u2019t rely on a AIO brewing system. Highlight more extract/partial mash brews, easier to consume volumes, make a whole assortment of SMaSH ale videos to showcase how bare bones brewing recipes can be while still tasting amazing. Or conversely make that imperial stout video *but* small batch and using only a brew bag+kitchen equipment.\n\nAnd again this goes to all beer homebrewing channels and influencers/advocates, not trying to pick on Clawhammer Supply, they\u2019re great! They have very polished fun videos, they livestream brew days, but I can\u2019t quite help but feel that the big picture is still being missed. TheBruSho also talked about something similar on his channel about getting back to showcasing simpler brewing methods so I feel like I'm not alone in this.\n\n**Final words**\n\nApproachability, accessibility and cost-effectiveness should have just as much attention as expensive temperature controlled pressure fermenters and shiny stainless steel all-in-one systems. Clearly brewing isn\u2019t as \u201cdead\u201d as we think since mead channels have become bigger. But look at how they present the hobby, the largest mead making channels are still using 1 gallon, basic carboys! Granted mead is an easier process, but beer brewing can look just as approachable too!\n\nDiving into this hobby has been incredibly fun and empowering. The absolute WEALTH of knowledge&experience on this subreddit from every user and the greater homebrewing forums/community has been priceless.

I tend to view porter as an all-malt beer, as opposed to stout which should have unmalted grain in it, so I\u2019d like to avoid any flaked barley/wheat/oats or roasted barley (I know it\u2019s not totally rational, nor is there much historical context to support this; this is just my opinion on the matter \ud83e\udee0)\n\nMy two biggest concerns are whether or not maple spirals will deliver the flavor of maple syrup without the need for stabilizing or using artificial flavorings, and the amount of smoked malt a lot of recipes call for, usually to the tune of 20% of the grist. Cherrywood smoked malt is what I want to use for its bacon-y flavor, but I know from experience that it can be *quite* potent, so I\u2019m a little worried that that would be too much, especially with the amount of roasted malts in this recipe turning it into umami/soy sauce. \n\nSUGAR SHACK PORTER RECIPE (5 gal)\n\n7.5 lbs US Pale Ale malt (61.2%)\n2.5 lbs US Cherrywood smoked malt (20.4%)\n1 lb UK CaraStan (8.2%)\n0.75 lbs US Chocolate malt (6.1%)\n0.5 lbs Black malt (4.1%)\n\nMash @ 156F for one hour, 168F mash out\n\n2 oz.

I think they're a cool design and I'll probably keep one for myself, but the weird thing is it looks like the company that made these never actually sold any. There is zero info online and the company seems to never have had any listed for sale, they are also a cold brew company not beer, but as someone who works in distilling professionally and does some home brewing myself I definitely think these are cool and see the value for home brewers.The problem I have is if I'm going to try and sell the extra ones I have I don't really have anything to compare them to for a price point. I know the pumps alone are about $60 on amazon, I have a few of my own already, and the extra tc fittings, hose,  and electrical components would probably be like $40ish depending on sourcing. So I was thinking to list these for like $150 bucks a piece plus shipping, estimated to be about $15. My question to you all is does this seem useful and does my pricing idea seem reasonable for  these? Part of me feels like I might be undervaluing these since I know from experience custom stainless work is really expensive, but I don't honestly know how much home brewers would value that aspect.

So I want to cut down on vegetal matter for the WC IPA I'm going to brew next using the same hop schedule.\n\nI scoured a bunch of old posts on here and think I have a good plan but obviously any input would be appreciated. It is clear that you use half as much T-45 as you would T-90 hops and general consensus is that you want to aim for a 50/50 mix of T-45 to T-90 pellets. Also, T-45 are really only good for late hot side and cold side hop additions. And reading up hopshot seems to be pretty straightforward, just add right to the boil.\n\nThis WC IPA will be 5.5 gal batch targeting a 1.064 OG and finish around 7% abv. Targeting around 73 ibu.\n\nMy hop schedule: \n-4 mL Columbus hop shot @ 75 min\n-0.8 oz Centennial T-90 at 10 min\n-0.8 oz Nelson T-90 at 10 min\n-1.2 oz Centennial T-90 at whirlpool\n-1.2 oz Nelson T-90 at whirlpool\n-1 oz Chinook T-45 @ dry hop\n-1 oz Motueka T-45 @ dry hop\n-2 oz Moutere T-90 @ dry hop\n\nLet me know if anyone thinks there is room for improvement or if you agree with my approach.

{"title": "Amazon counter-pressure bottler", "selftext": "I'm not ready to keg yet, but I also wasn't happy with using a bottling bucket and priming sugar for carbonation, so I took an intermediate step.  Found a guy selling 11 pallets of kegs for $20 each and got two of them that had carbonation stones.\n\nSo I did a closed transfer from my Fermzilla to the keg, and set it up for forced carbonation at 30psi (10 for the stone, 18 from a chart based on beer style and temperature, and another 2 just because).  However, it was still carbonating after several hours, and I just stopped because I was afraid of over carbonating the beer.\n\nBut the main part of this post was to talk about the lever-operated counter pressure bottlers showing up on Amazon.  I'd had mine in my list for months, and when I went to buy it the price jumped 15%.  That pretty much sucked, and it wasn't noticeable BEFORE it went in the cart.  I've had this issue with stuff I've purchased from Amazon before.  As it was, it was 50% of the price of a Boel device or clone.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/uI3NpJ6](https://imgur.com/a/uI3NpJ6)\n\nThis device has 4 ports, and no instructions in english.  Communications with the sellers didn't help, I had to figure it out.  Basically, gas goes in the left upper port, beer in the right.  The lower left port is for purging the bottle, the lower right port when cracked gets the beer flowing.\n\nA few things this device needs:\n\n1. a backlight so you can better see where the beer is in the neck.  I'll probably 3d print a mount for some Amazon light.\n2. a collection jar with a mount to the back to catch the foam.  Probably will 3D print that as well.\n3. a drip tray to mount it to - there's a lot of drippage\n4. a means to clamp it down.  If you have a big enough drip tray it might work without a clamp, but actuating the lever over-centers the device and tips it over.\n5. a hose to go from the nipple under the seal to the bottom of your bottles.\n\nOther improvements:\n\n1. re-designing the linkage so that you can pull the lever from the front\n2. more common line sizes - all of the lines are 5/16 ID, nearly 1/2\" OD.  Could not find adapters at Home Depot, our local hardware store, or even McMaster Carr, so I made some by putting 1/4\" compression sleeves inside my 5/16 lines, stuffing those into the 1/2\" lines and hose clamping them.  Worked fine, no leaks.\n3. instead of the compression connections at the machine for beer and gas, ball locks would have been much easier.  And for some reason, they used a duotite fitting instead of a compression on the gas bleed line.  if those compression adapters are 1/4 NPT on the machine side this will be an easy fix (but another $20)\n\nSetup requires adjusting the upper clamp bolt (where the lever attaches at the top) to put enough spring pressure on the silicone seal when it sits on the bottle such that it won't lift at the pressure you are bottling at.  This takes a bit of trial and error.  I started at 20 PSI.  Then you adjust the bottom clamp that the mechanism rests on when there's no bottle in it.\n\nTo use it you:\n\n1. lift the mechanism with the lever and place a bottle under the seal, and release the lever.\n2. Turn the handle to the left.  Gas will enter the bottle\n3. turn the bleed screw to vent the gas out of the bottle; then close the bleed screw.\n4. turn the handle to the right.  Beer might start flowing slowly, if not, crack the liquid knob on the right.  It doesn't take much to really get it going.  It is much faster than a bucket wand filler.  Close the knob when the beer is just below where you want it, then return the handle to the center position.\n5. vent the pressure and foam in the bottle using the bleed screw again.\n6. wrap a towel around the top of the neck and lift the seal with the lever.  Tilt the bottom of the bottle towards you and pull it out.  Cap as usual.\n\nIt takes between 1.5-2 minutes per bottle, including the time it takes to remove several bottles from the fridge, filling, and capping.\n\nSo the biggest downside is that the fill level is inconsistent.  Sometimes I got a lot of foam and had to push it out, sometimes I didn't.  Sometimes when I'd remove the bottle I'd get a lot more foam, sometimes I didn't.  As a result my bottles go from filled just at the bottom of the neck to within 1/4\" of the top.  I really don't have a handle on what the proper keg pressure and pressure to run the device ought to be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jsb6ur/amazon_counterpressure_bottler/", "created_utc": 1743880566.0, "score": 12, "author": "swampcholla", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jsb6ur/amazon_counterpressure_bottler/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Market Homebrewing (and Brewing Content) as the Cost Effective way to Drink Beer", "selftext": "I started as a poor student who had $50 for a brew bucket, spoon, airlock, and a tin of Coopers Australian Lager. I was bragging to my buddies I made beer that's \"good enough\" for 50 cents a bottle. Over the years I got better equipment (and experience). The tone changed from trying to convince friends the beer is okay to receiving praises and jubilation. This is probably a familiar story with most people reading this. \n\nWith a dreary outlook of our local homebrew shops, they need new blood to keep the hobby going. The incoming global recession and tariffs on beer cans translates to consumers looking to curb luxury spending (aka beer). Encouraging those consumers to try basic fermentation kits and/ or cheap brew in a bag recipes with household equipment is 1: A good way to get new comsumers into hobby. 2: Keep the market afloat through rough economic times. Spell it out how cheap this is per bottle, if they enjoy it they'll get sucked in deeper when they can afford it\n\nWatching videos of Martin Keen using his $1000 fermenter, $1500 glycol chiller, on a $1000 brew vessel is cool and what I strive for but I'm not spending $3000+ day 1 on any new hobby. Not knocking you Martin, you do great content! But you can start feeling overwhelmed by the expensive options. If I wanted to get into sewing, a $3000 machine would be intimidating, I'll start with a needle and thread and see where that leads me. I'd love to absorb more 'back to basics' homebrew content, anyone remember Craigtube?\n\nAdmittedly, my bias is in the message. A buddy came back from an extended stay in Germany where beer is a fraction of the cost at home. Once back he realized he was shorter on cash because beer was comparatively expensive here, why not brew it himself and save some money. \n\nWe need more 'brewing for the everyperson' messages that encourage folks to lean into hobby and dive into the community. Content creators and retailers, tell everyone how great your products are, but don't forget to remind people it would work wonderfully with inexpensive options too.\n\n'This much beer from the store retails $100, but with our system it'll cost you $20 a batch. Save even more by reusing your yeast and *these* cost saving measures on your next brew. After 'X' batches the system pays for itself' At least that's how I justified my first brew vessel. \n\nKeep flaunting your rigs but remind folks of \\[most of our\\] humble beginnings.\n\nTL;DR - Encourage inexpensive accessibility to brewing and spell it out for folks curious about the hobby.

When I last spoke with Dawn, she didn't have an exact closure date yet, but said \"within the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nWithin the past year, we have lost The Brewmeister, O'Hara Brew House Supply, and soon Chico.  This now leaves for many the closest physical HBS being Sierra Moonshine in Grass Valley. \n\nIt goes without saying that us in this community all understand how the market works and how this fantastic hobby of ours is declining. All I want to say is, if you still have HBS, cherish it, shop it, and let them know that you're thankful that they are still there.

Last summer I tried the tub of water method with frozen water bottles to keep it at a constant cooler temp, but this was less than reliable due to me being busy, and a hassle I wouldn't mind throwing a few bucks at to solve.  \n\nEver since I saw the TempTwister from Kegland (basically an immersion chiller for your fermenter) I was thinking about using an STC temp controller with a small pump and an ice water resevoir to chill the fermenter, but then I saw a cheap 20-30 dollar peltier cooler setup online that was designed to chill water and it looks almost perfect, so I wanted to see what you guys thought.  \n\nHere's a mock-up of my idea: [https://imgur.com/onwVUWz](https://imgur.com/onwVUWz)  \n\nThe cooler is 150-230 watts depending on the model, and estimating a conservative measure of 30 watts of heat being produced by the fermenter at full tilt, I think this should be able to handle that heat no problem. With the sleeping bag I use for insulation, I've had it at a delta of 5C under ambient and only lose about .5 degree a day, so I'm hoping that it will be able to stave off warm air temperature fluctuation (and potentially the occasional heatwave) and really reduce the need for the cooling system to run.  \n\nI know that Peltier cooling is horribly inefficient compared to the refrigeration process, but I don't have the space for another fridge/freezer, so I was looking for something like this as a compact and put-away-able solution. I'm hoping that I can get a duty cycle around .25 (again a conservative measure considering nights) to keep it in the mid 60's F and over two weeks I think it should burn \\~9kw or a \\~$1.50 in power, cheaper than buying even a small bag of ice .  \n\nUnless my estimates are way off and impractical, this seems to a really cheap and effective solution, so I was wondering why this hasn't been talked about more?

{"title": "Kentucky Common: please advise on my first all-grain brew & recipe", "selftext": "I've learning about the existence of Kentucky Common two days ago, and have decided to brew one tomorrow night to bring to a friends May 3rd Derby/birthday party. I'll be using my speidel 3.2 gallon fermenter (it's really a bit larger, should be able to handle 3 gallons or a little less). I couldn't find a pre-built recipe that was exactly what I wanted, but based on what I could find, I have decided on the following:\n\n* 3.25 lb 6 row\n\n* 1.25 lb flaked corn\n\n* 2.3 oz chocolate malt\n\n* 2.3 oz crystal 40\n\n* .45 oz cluster for bittering at 60 minutes\n\n* .2 oz cluster for aroma at 5 minutes\n\nBrewfather tells me that the above with 4.19 gallons of pre-boil water will get me a 3 gallon final batch with no sparge, with ABV 4.5%, SRM 14, and IBU 22. I haven't plugged numbers into Brunwater yet but I'm thinking amber balanced? Possibly with a little extra gypsum.\n\nWhile I would have used US-05 if I had more time, given the short timeline, I am thinking half a packet of Kveik Lutra will do the trick, with a little fermaid-O 6-12 hours after pitch. Brewing tomorrow night with Lutra will hopefully allow bottling next Wednesday or shortly thereafter, which will allow 3 weeks of bottle conditioning followed by 72 hours in the fridge before the party.\n\nI wanted to keep this as historically accurate as possible without getting too crazy (see flaked corn instead of grits) and obviously with the exception of using Kveik (which others seem to have had success with in these beers). I almost left the aroma out entirely since it wasn't clear to me how historically accurate that is and me and my friends usually prefer minimal to none obvious hop flavor, but I figured a little wouldn't be overpowering or overshadow the rest of the beer.\n\nThis will be my first all-grain, the first recipe I've ever designed, and the first time I've ever adjusted my water.

{"title": "Switched to bottles and I'm never going back.", "selftext": "I switched to fermenting in a bottles and I'm never going back.\r\n\r\nI moved on from kegs to bottles as my neipas quickly started looking brown and tasting of cardboard even though i used ascorbic acid and closed transfer. The kegs was also quit a hassle to lift and drink from, but they did become lighter and lighter as the weeks went by. Bottles are much lighter, easier to drink from and the batch oxidize more slowly as the bottles are emptied when opened. They are also way cheaper when sharing beer to friends and family!\r\n\r\nBut how do you ferment in bottles? Trub takes up so much space and dryhopping is really hard to do effectively. Often only about half of the bottle is somewhat clear beer and the rest is trub and hops. I just can't find hopbags small enough. Also go through a lot of caps because of the blowups (and dryhopping in the middle of fermentation). Wanted to share a tip though, before dryhopping you can breath co2 into the bottles to prevent oxidation .\r\n\r\nCan you find spunding valves or a adapter that would make them fit my bottles? Or should i transfer to a bigger serving bottle? As said, I go through a lot of caps and should probably get gross bottles. That will save me money on caps. All the gushers might be because of the yeast.\r\n\r\nAnother problem I have is that its pretty slow to bottle a batch when you have to squat over each bottle first to add the yeast. Thighs are so fucking sore after bottling a 10G batch.\r\nSome of my friends have gotten coldsores from my homebrew, but thats probably because they didnt wash their mouths with a soap BEFORE rinsing with starsan.

{"title": "New To All-Grain / Inconsistent Efficiency", "selftext": "My wife and I have been homebrewing for 2+ years, mostly using Dry Malt Extract and having decent results.  We both wanted to try to move to all-grain brewing, so at the beginning of 2025, we decided do so.  \n\nWe are not trying to be crazy and chase these incredibly high efficiencies that I know some people do and it can drive them crazy.  We just want to be a bit more consistent so that when we plan recipes, we be closer to those numbers or hit them more often than not.\n\nOut of our four all-grain attempts, we have been approximatley 51%, 62%, 50%, 46% efficient (according to the brewers friend efficiency calculator).  We use brewfather and if I take the recipe we just used, which I planned for 60% efficiency, and adjust it to what we actually were (46%) the OG comes out close, if not spot on to what we hit.  \n\nEquipment:\n\n* Anvil Foundry 6.5 gallon (120V)\n* A glass wide mouth bubbler fermenter from Northern Brewer\n* Tilt Hydrometer\n* Brewbag \n\nOur brew process is typically this:\n\n1.  Fill Anvil Foundry with 3.25 gallons of water, set to 156\u00b0F (Strike temp) at 100% power  \n2.  While the water is heating, we measure the ingredients we will need.  \n3.  Once the water reaches 156\u00b0F, I set the temp to 152\u00b0F and set the power to 80%  \n4.  Pour in grain into the brew bag which is over the grain basket (we have also tried using the brew bag directly over the foundry as well)  \n5.  Stir grain, and begin 60 minute mash timer.  We typically stir every 10-15 minutes during this 60 minute mash.  \n6.  Once we have reached the 60 minute mark, we mash out at 170\u00b0F for approximately 10 minutes.  \n7.  We lift the grain up, allow it to drain for a few minutes, while we set the Anvil to boil and 100% power.  \n8.  Bring wort to a boil, and brew like we did with DME, adding our hops, etc.   \n9.  We typically end up right at or just slightly above our target of 2 gallons going into the fermenter.\n\n* Grain is coming from a local homebrew store, they are crushing it for us.\n* Temperature reading for the strike water, mash water, and boil is all coming straight from the LCD screen on the Anvil Foundry\n* We are currently not recirculating during the mash (but we do have a pump and hoses and would have the ability to if we needed to)\n\nThe Anvil Foundry manual recommends 3.8 gallons of water for 4 lbs of grain with a strike temperature of 156\u00b0F (Anvil Foundry running at 120v)\n\nOr it recommends 3.9 gallons of water for 5 lbs of grain with a strike temperature of 157\u00b0F (Anvil Foundry running at 120v)\n\nBoth of these are assuming you want to yield 2.5 gallons going into your fermenter.\n\nLooking at one of Northern Brewer's recipe's, they say \"if you are new to all grain, we recommend 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain for mash thickness\".  \n\nIf I'm doing the math correctly, that would put us at less than 2 gallons of water for 5 lbs of grain which seems a bit low.\n\n  \nSo...\n\nWhat can we change or fix within reason?  Personally, I would like to make one or two changes at a time and not change a bunch of stuff.  Too many variables at once seemingly make it more difficult to figure out what is or isn't working.  \n\nYour help is greatly appreciated.  I can provide pictures of the grain crush, or anything else for that matter if you need it.  \n\nThank you!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jnkcve/new_to_allgrain_inconsistent_efficiency/", "created_utc": 1743362835.0, "score": 6, "author": "KMFL87", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jnkcve/new_to_allgrain_inconsistent_efficiency/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Grain crush", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/6KUcmlH\n\nI'm getting back into brewing after a 12 year hiatus. I purchased milled grain from Morebeer and also purchased grain from FH Steinbarts in Portland where I put it through the mill myself after getting their advice on a proper roller gap setting for batch sparging (out of a cooler with a braided hose). The courseness between the two are wildly different.\n\nSo, I'm pretty sure the high level correct answer is that I need to buy my own mill. It's on my list. In the meantime, which of these grinds is best for batch sparging? I feel like I'm at risk of underextraction with the Morebeer crush. I'm okay with adjusting the recipe to a 4gal batch instead of 5, or maybe even adding extract to bump the gravity up, but neither of these are ideal.\n\nMy main question is should I even try to mash this Morebeer grain or does it need to make its way through a mill a second time? Or is the Morebeer crush good and the other over-milled?

I have just under 2lbs of T-90 pellet hops in roughly 12 gallons of beer. Obviously, there is a huge amount of hop material in the cone. Just for kicks, I hooked up the FlexChamber, purged the cup and dumped. Then dumped that, rinsed, sanitized, purged, and dumped again three more times before I got bored and grabbed a bucket. At the beginning, I was telling myself I was possibly preventing a molecule or two of o2 from traveling up the dump port. I know...\n\nThrough the process, I was starting to wonder if still needed to do the very slow opening of the dump port we've been conditioned to do. It seems like it's possible there would be no downside to just opening the port fully right from the start. My thinking was that even if some beer channeled through the trub and hops, eventually that heavier material would work it's way down and the beer would be displaced and head upwards. On dump four, I just opened it fully and walked away for ten minutes. Upon return, it seemed like most of what was in the cup was think hop material with the most dense material in the bottom.

{"title": "Screwed up my Witbier... bad. Tips on fixing it?", "selftext": "TL;DR I watered down my witbier by accident. OG is now 1.036. What, if anything, should I do to help fix it?\n\nCome and hear my tale of woe, and hopefully learn from my mistakes.\n\nI'm brewing a witbier that will be served to celebrate my newborn that is due one month from now. Hoping the timeline works out. It's a gamble. It's meant to be a 5 gallon batch. I did my research, made my recipe, ordered supplies. Today, I'm getting ready to dough in, and realize I've got an extra pound each of flaked wheat and pilsner malt. After doing some quick calculations, I realize I must have made this change earlier and forgotten about it, and decided to just use all of it. Foreshadowing, this may have saved my bacon.\n\nMash goes great, holding a steady 152F for an hour, stirring occasionally. I BIAB, so at Mash out, I raise my bag on the pulley I have installed, and give her a good squeeze. Sometimes I sparge over the bag, sometimes not. I didn't, and this time, I definitely should have. The water was noticably low in the pot (I assume the wheat and rice hulls held onto more water than malt usually would). Anyway, I decided I'd just top it up at the end of the boil. Plus side to this is the boil and chill will both be more efficient with lower boil volume. So I sanitize and fill two kitchen pots with filtered tap water. This is something I've done before with good results.\n\nAs I'm chilling, I pour in the two pots of water. Now that water line is significantly higher than usual. Uh oh. Well, I'm committed now.\n\nI complete the rest of the process, and rack to the fermenter. It's waaay too full. So I pitch my yeast, mix as well as I can without spilling the beer, then scrubbed and sanitized a spare 1 gallon growler, bung, and airlock. I rack off the gallon, and the level in the fermenter is better now. Problem is, my original OG I was aiming for was 1.053. But now it's only 1.036. With a complete fermentation, that's kind of a small beer. I'm also worried my pitch rate will be really really low.\n\nLessons learned:\n\nOnly top up level in the fermenter itself, or once I have a brewpot with graduated markings, use that as a guide.\n\nTake better notes on my recipe ahead of time.\n\n\n\nSo the question is: should I attempt to fix this beer by adding sugar or something? Should I pitch another pouch of yeast in a few days when I can get some? Or should I leave it be, and just learn lessons for the future?\n\n  \nThanks all!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jkh509/screwed_up_my_witbier_bad_tips_on_fixing_it/", "created_utc": 1743009508.0, "score": 1, "author": "dezstern", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jkh509/screwed_up_my_witbier_bad_tips_on_fixing_it/", "html_title": ""}

Only thing is I left both brews in the fermenter for longer than usual, probably a week past the fermentation stopping.\n\nOne was a Coopers Pale Ale with light dry malt and the yeast you get with the can. Your typical off the shelf variety stuff. This had that typical oxidized, unpleasant tounge feel as you quite often get with straight out of the can stuff. Still very drinkable, when it's that cheap, I don't really care.\n\nThen next was a All Inn Brewing Session Ale fresh wort kit, with US05 yeast, the same process. This tasted far superior, with none of that \"oxidized\" taste and pretty close to a decent craft beer.\n\nSo, I am confused as to why would the cheapo coopers kit taste oxidized over the other one.

{"title": "Keg Ferment. Fining, Cold Crashing, and Dry Hopping .", "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI have been scouring the forums and haven\u02bbt really found the answer I am looking for about order of operations for fining, dry hopping, and cold crashing, and a lot of the discussion seemed about 10 years old. I think a part of this is that there are just many different opinions on the topic and ways to do it that work, but I am curious about what current methods people are using. Basically, I am fermenting an IPA in a keg, and trying to decide on the best order for each of these operations, while introducing the least amount of oxygen as possible. \n\nMy beer has already finished dropping gravity, so dry hopping during full ferment is already out of the question. I did add pellet hops already as a colder whirlpool around 140F and my original plan was to just transfer this into a purged serving keg with more pellets in there. However, when I pulled a gravity reading sample, I also tasted it and noticed a strong polyphenol and hop burn flavor, which made me think that gelatin fining would be a good idea to try and drop some of that out. \n\nThe question is what would be the best way to do this and still get some fresh hop flavor into the beer? \n\nI have seen some cases where people use a CO2 filled bottle to inject gelatin into the keg and that seems pretty easy to set up, but would fining the beer and then putting it onto more hop pellets in the serving keg ruin the point of fining in the first place? I do have Flotit 2.0 floating dip tubes on both the ferm keg and the serving keg. \n\nAnother option is to put the gelatin in the serving keg, which would help me from having to inject it as the gelatin could just be in the purged keg. I have to say that I don\u02bbt love the idea of the serving keg having a mass of gelatin at the bottom though. Mostly because moving it might stir it up and I guess there is also the joy of having just beer and maybe hops in the finished beer. \n\nAs far as cold crashing, it seems there are also different methods. I have read the brulosophy experiment https://brulosophy.com/2015/01/05/the-gelatin-effect-exbeeriment-results/. It seems to me that a cold crash just before fining is the way to go. If I go that route then it seems to rule out gelatin in the serving keg. \n\nAnyway, what is your preferred methodology or what would you recommend to me for this beer and/or future beers? \n\n  \nMy goals are: \n\n1. Clearish beer (Doesn\u02bbt need to be perfect, just don\u02bbt want it yeasty) \n\n2. Not too astringent (harsh bitter flavors/polyphenols) \n\n3. No oxygenation (I have killed my past IPAs this way, so I am a little paranoid)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jhinu6/keg_ferment_fining_cold_crashing_and_dry_hopping/", "created_utc": 1742677483.0, "score": 1, "author": "Dripping_Champagne", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jhinu6/keg_ferment_fining_cold_crashing_and_dry_hopping/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Micro rant: Is homebrewing actually dead?", "selftext": "EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing everybody! Its nice to talk to yall and hear your stories!! \u2665\ufe0f\n\nEDIT2: This was my goal with this thread. Not to answer that question. But to provoke discussion. And it worked. I heard so many amazing stories - it literaly made my day \u2665\ufe0f. Had alot of nice chat. Thats what its about - community. THANK YOU!\n\nGoood day people!!\n\nI got into brewing 3 years ago. Jumped straight in. Learning alot. Making notes. Finding the brews I love. It was almost all that I could think about. \n\nNot gona lie. After few years I am not that super in to it. But mainly because I have alot of knowledge and brewing became natural as baking a pizza on saturday evening. I have the brews our family likes to drink or have around. So it is just a part of our lives. Yes I try new recipes. And yes I try new brewing methods. But it does consume way less of my time as when starting out.\n\nIn my opinion homebrewing is no way dead, but is sure looks like it sometimes.. I mean it is crazy that you can make super tasty stuff that you cant get in a supermarket.. And oh boy. With all the price increases of groceries and overall cost of living. LMAO. You can make super solid craft beer or mead for the third of the price..\n\nI never bought fancy equipment. My celar is full of cider, meads, beer. I use a bucket and a stock pot. Do I dream about stainless steel stuff? You bet I do.. But I can not afford it sadly..\n\nBut on the other hand I could see why its feels like homebrewing is dying. There are fewer subredits or posts in homebrewtalk. Many content creators just stoped pumping out new recipe videos. I guess they were \u201cat the peak performance\u201d back then. New recipes new videos new ideas. But for how long can you do it. Life hits. You have kids etc. \n\nIm 100% sure that they are brewing constantly and their keezers have full kegs. As I mentioned some slowed down because of life. And maybe yes, because interest is declining they stop seing the point puting out hard work in to content as there is no need for it..\n\nAll in all. I think homebrewing will never die. Its a staple at my home. Its a great hobby. And with technology available these days you can have a 20 minute brew day and have super tasty homebrews. Kits are available. Used equipment is available. Super fast and clean yeasts are available.. All you need is the desire to do it, and to continue doing it..\n\nWhat are your thoughts about it? You still brew? Less, more? Nothing changed?\n\nPlease share!\n\nCheers! \u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\n\nP.S.

{"title": "Mash Temp", "selftext": "Getting ready for my next brew. It is another hazy. Love the style. Want to nail it before moving on. I have been striking out. Past few beers just taste watered down in every aspect. I imagine this is what is referred to as 'thin' or 'dry'. My last brew tastes like shit. Probably going to dump the keg. I mashed in at 150F as recommended for the recipe.\n\nI have everything else down for the most part. Do my water profiles. Temp controlled brews. Even pitch number of yeast correct. So, everything I am reading sends me back to my mash temp. I use a Brewzilla. When I make a recipe that calls for 150F mash temp, I set the Brewzilla to 150F and am prob about 2-3 degrees lower at times.\n\nThis next brew, I am going to shoot for 156 or 157F for mash in. I want more body out of the beer. Not some watererd down crap. Hell I feel like I add enough hops and have a good grist to give me that.\n\nQuestion is - what temp do you all mash in at for your IPAs? Seems like the higher the temp, the more body I will get out of it because the yeast will leave behind some more sugars. When I drink a commercial beer, I can taste that sugar. In my homebrew its significantly less of a body and thus, seems watered down.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Slamming a few The Beast of Both Worlds IPA from Lagunitas at the moment. I apologize for typos.

I don't think there's really any way to cut the cost on the dextrose (I buy a 25kg bag), so the only thing that's left to cut costs is the nutrient blend.

{"title": "Belgian Yeast Temperature Debacle (accidental m47 overheating)", "selftext": "Hey everyone. So I'm a fan of Belgian styles, and I went to make my tried and true belgian blonde recipe which I know and love. However in my most recent batch I made a slight mistake trusting an old tape-on thermometer instead of my usual candy thermometer, and pitched my yeast (M47) at about 26-27 degrees C instead of what I was aiming for, around 22-24. I didn't notice this slip up until about a day later at which point it was already vigorously fermenting, and the temperature free-rose up to 28C. I've since moved the fermentor into a cooler part of my kitchen in hopes of slightly recovering from that, but... is there any cause for concern? It smells a bit more... thin and cider-ey than my previous batches with the same recipe, and I know it's definitely too early to judge any tasting (it's still only been fermenting for 2 days or so) but it seems mostly ok, though definitely... homebrew-alcohol tasting, which I didn't get in my earlier batches.\n\n  \nAll of this is really just to ask, how important is temperature regulation at the start of fermentation, and is it worth trying to cool down my fermentor now, or do I risk stalling out the yeast? What have been other people's experiences with running M47 on the warmer side?\n\n  \nthanks, and fingers crossed I haven't left myself with 25L of fusel hooch.

{"title": "Experiment - Re-use spent dryhops for bittering another batch", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm planning an experiment soon: I want to use spent hops from a small dry hop addition in my last brew as the bittering addition for my next batch. This Friday, I'll be brewing 25 liters of lager, aiming for 21 IBUs. Before fermentation, I'll split the batch into two 12.5 L portions to ferment them with different yeasts. One of the batches will also receive a flameout addition to reach approximately 30 IBUs (91\u00b0C, 10 minutes).\n\nThe dry hop blend consisted of 9g Cryo Citra (23% alpha acid) and 18g Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9% alpha acid). After cold crashing, I collected the spent hops in a hop sock, pressed them slightly, and ended up with a crumbly hop mass weighing 45g.\n\nThe key question now is: How can I estimate the remaining alpha acids in this spent hop mass? To explore this, I conducted a sensory test and also developed a workflow with ChatGPT. I'll share the details below. I\u2019ve also included credible sources, particularly the study *\"Investigating the potential for re-using 'spent' dry-hops in the brew kettle.\"*\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts\u2014do my assumptions make sense, or is there anything you\u2019d add? Of course, I'll share my results once the beer is finished.\n\nThanks a lot, and cheers! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter sleeping on it, I think the numbers generated by ChatGPT are mostly nonsense, and there was likely a calculation error as well. It all feels too much like a shot in the dark with too many unknowns. I think it would be wise to rely on one of two methods:\n\n1.) Using the numbers from the study, though we don\u2019t know exactly what the spent hops looked like\u2014were they still wet, or were they pressed like mine? That would certainly impact the remaining alpha acids.\n\n2.) Relying on my sensory test\u2014this result is probably the better reference in any case.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll go with 50 %, as it aligns with my sensory test. I\u2019ll also taste the wort every 20 minutes or so to get a better sense of whether it needs more or not. That would mean\u00a0**7.5 % Alpha Acids**, which, according to Brewfather, translates to\u00a0**27 grams at 60 minutes**\u00a0for\u00a0**21 IBUs**.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the workflow I worked out with ChatGPT:\n\n# 1. Initial Situation:\n\nA **25-liter batch** with **21 IBU** is being brewed. The boil volume is 30 liters, brewed with a Grainfather G30. The boil time is 60 minutes. After boiling, the batch will be split in half. 12.5 liters of wort will then be increased to **30 IBU** with an aroma addition (whirlpool, 91\u00b0C, 10 minutes).\n\nThe bittering hops used are **spent hops from a previous dry hopping** with:\n\n**9 g Citra Cryo (23% alpha acid)**\n\n**18 g Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9% alpha acid)**\n\nThe **spent hops from the previous batch were collected and pressed in a hop bag**. After pressing, **45 g of spent hops** remained \u2013 a moist, crumbly mass.\n\n# 2. Remaining Alpha Acids in Spent Hops\n\nStudies show that after dry hopping, about **52% (industrial scale) to 77% (pilot scale) of the original alpha acids** remain in the spent hops.\n\n*Original source: \"Approximately one-third of the dry-matter composition of hops was lost during dry-hopping regardless of hop variety; however, there was high retention of both \u03b1-acids (77% pilot scale, 52% industrial) and hop essential oil (51% pilot scale, 33% industrial).\" - (Study: \"Investigating the potential for re-using 'spent' dry-hops in the brew kettle\".)*\n\nThe average value here is **64.5%**, but both the pilot-scale experiment (smaller-scale trials) and the sensory experiment (Section 3) suggest that a higher residual value is plausible. Therefore, from Section 3 onward, we assume **70% residual alpha acid**.\n\nThe study's reported residual values most likely refer to **moist spent hops**, as industrial processes typically work directly with the collected spent hops. This matches the condition of the spent hops used in our experiment, so no additional moisture content correction is necessary.\n\n# 3. Sensory Experiment to Estimate Alpha Acid Content\n\nA sensory experiment was conducted to estimate the remaining alpha acid content of the spent hops. Two samples were prepared with **100 ml of boiling water each**:\n\n* **Sample 1:** 1 g Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9% alpha acid)\n* **Sample 2:** 1 g Spent Hops Mix\n\nBoth samples were steeped for **10 minutes** and then strained through a tea bag. The temperature at the time of straining was **43\u00b0C**.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n* The **Nelson Sauvin** infusion was slightly darker, smelled spicy, and had an intense bitterness (7/10 on a subjective scale).\n* The **spent hop infusion** was lighter, had a mild vanilla aroma, and exhibited significantly less bitterness (4/10 on the same scale).\n* On another scale where Nelson Sauvin was rated 5, the spent hops were rated around 3.\n\n**Estimation of Alpha Acid Content in Spent Hops:** Based on perceived bitterness, an initial approximation is:\n\n* Ratio from the first scale: 10,9x(4/7)=6,23%\n* Ratio from the second scale:10,9x(3/5)=6,54%\n* Average: **6.39% alpha acid**\n\n**Effect of Steeping Time:** Alpha acid extraction does not occur instantly but requires time and high temperatures. Studies show that:\n\n*At 80\u201390\u00b0C, approximately 50% of bitter compounds are extracted within 15 minutes, whereas at 60\u00b0C, only 20\u201330% dissolve.*\n\n*Original source: \"Influence of Temperature and Time on the Extraction of Bitter Compounds during Wort Boiling\" by Jaskula et al. (2008).*\n\nSince the temperature during the experiment dropped from **100\u00b0C to 43\u00b0C**, the average temperature was closer to **70\u201350\u00b0C** throughout the steeping process. Extraction likely only reached **40\u201350% of the possible bitter compounds**, suggesting that the actual alpha acid content in the spent hops could be **higher than estimated through sensory evaluation**.\n\n**Adjusted Estimate:** Taking extraction rates into account, the actual alpha acid content of the spent hops could range from **8% to 9%**, which aligns well with literature values for remaining alpha acids (52\u201377% of the original content). The original dry-hopping mix contained **Citra Cryo (23%)** and **Nelson Sauvin T90 (10.9%)**, yielding a combined alpha acid content of **14.93%**.\n\n# 4. Comparison of Sensory Estimation and Theoretical Values\n\nThe sensory estimate suggested **6.39% alpha acid**. Given the applied time and temperature, an extraction efficiency of **45%** was assumed, leading to an actual value of **9.28% alpha acid**.\n\nOn the other hand, theoretical calculations suggest that if **70% of the original alpha acids** remain (based on study data), the residual alpha acid content would be **10.45%**. The difference between these values is only **1.17%**.\n\nThus, for future calculations, an **average residual alpha acid content of 9.87%** is used.\n\n# 5. Calculation of Spent Hop Amount for Desired Bitterness\n\nTo achieve **21 IBU** in the total wort (25 liters final volume), spent hops are used. The boil volume is 30 liters, and the hop utilization rate for a **60-minute boil** is estimated at **25%**. The spent hops have a residual alpha acid content of **9.87%**.\n\nThe required total alpha acid amount to achieve 21 IBU is calculated as:\n\nThe required amount of spent hops is then calculated as:\n\n**Additional Bitterness for Half of the Wort to 30 IBU (Brewfather Estimate):** Since the wort is split into two equal halves (**12.5 liters each**), one half should be increased to **30 IBU** using a hop addition at **91\u00b0C for 10 minutes**.\n\n**According to Brewfather, the remaining spent hops (23.7 g) are sufficient to reach the target bitterness of 30 IBU in the second half of the wort.**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* **21.3 g spent hops** in the 30-liter boil volume provide **21 IBU** in the final 25-liter wort.\n* To increase **one half to 30 IBU**, **23.7 g spent hops** can be used at **91\u00b0C for 10 minutes**.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jdplem/experiment_reuse_spent_dryhops_for_bittering/", "created_utc": 1742250043.0, "score": 10, "author": "tombufry", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jdplem/experiment_reuse_spent_dryhops_for_bittering/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Foaming and Frustration", "selftext": "And yet, another post about beer foaming. I am frustrated that I can\u2019t figure this one out. I\u2019ve read articles, and watched videos. Most people say it comes down to too much pressure, or temperature. But, when you really keep listening or reading, there are a bunch of different reason including an unbalanced system.\n\nFirst, the system \u2013 I have 3 kegs in an old refrigerator that I keep at about 39/40F (4.4C). One keg is for carbonated water, and since it doesn\u2019t foam it\u2019s not an issue. The other two kegs are for beer. All three are connected to flow-control Nukataps via 3/16\u201d beer line.\n\nI have a Co2 manifold with three outputs to feed the kegs \u2013 each output has an individual pressure gauge. I like Belgian style beers and with the carbonated water I wanted the ability to control pressure to the individual kegs.\n\nI originally setup Keg-1 at \\~12psi, and Keg-2 at \u00a0\\~18-psi. This is inline with what most carbonation show as 2.5vols of Co2 for Keg-1, and 3.0vols of Co2 for Keg-2 at 40F (4.4C)\n\nI then used some calculators to balance the system and arrived at 10-Feet for Keg-1, and 15-Feet for Keg-2. I realize that there is some discrepancy between calculators, but I think this is close. I was hoping that with the flow rate taps I could tweak for small variations on-the-fly.\n\nThe problem is that all I get is foam, regardless of flow rate, or which keg I try to draw from. I\u2019ve measured the temperature of the beer in the glass and get a reading of 40F (4.4C), which is the same as the fridge. It\u2019s currently about 40F (4.4C) in my garage so this does not appear to be an issue of a first beer pour. Regardless, all subsequent pours are also all foam.\n\nIf I dial down the flow control to barely a trickle (1minute to \u201cpour\u201d a glass)?\u00a0 Foam.\u00a0 If I open it up? Foam. And this isn\u2019t foam as it hits the glass. It is foam coming out of the tap before it even touches the glass (again, regardless of flow rate).\n\nI\u2019ve since dropped the pressure in both kegs to under 10psi. Still get foam and now I feel like my beers are also under-carbonated, but that could be subjective since they are foaming so badly there isn\u2019t much Co2 left in the glass after a pour.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve got it dialed in on paper, and I\u2019ve tried different pressures, different beers/kegs, but all I get is constant foam. I understand that poor connections can cause this, but I find it hard to believe I have two bad connections (there is no Co2 or liquid leaking as far as I can tell). I don\u2019t see bubbles in the lines during a pour. I also find it hard to believe that I am over-pressurized as I\u2019ve got more than enough line and have dropped pressure to under 10psi, though it\u2019s entirely possible that the gauges on my manifold are off (how do you test?). But, I am open to the idea that I am missing some crucial element and would greatly appreciate some suggestions or insight for troubleshooting the issue from someone far more experienced than I am.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMuch appreciated, and have a cold one for me\u2026.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jc9sxs/foaming_and_frustration/", "created_utc": 1742086421.0, "score": 3, "author": "apriliarider", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1jc9sxs/foaming_and_frustration/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The Sap Riseth.", "selftext": "I made an invention last year which to cut a long story short is basically birch sap hop water. Now, I'll spare you the story but basically just say it's probably one of the best Innovations I've made and can't find anywhere on the internet as a thing. Anyway I say this again now because the sap is currently fully flowing but only will be for a few weeks max here in Scotland. Times will vary depending on where you live. If you want to try it tapping trees is fairly simple. I bought some antique aluminium taps that you can bang in and hang a demi John on to, but basically you're drilling a hole in a birch tree at a sight upwards angle and collecting the sap. I'm sure perforating a bit of beer line securely pushed in would work just as well. Simply choose reasonably mature trees 6 inch diameter and wait. I tapped 8 trees last night and this morning had almost 5 gallons. \n\nMy process is to heat the sap to about 90c to pasteurize then hop at about 30g per standard batch once it's dropped to 75 then let it cool. Then optionally add more dry hop or hop essence if desired.\n\nThe residual sweetness adds a real bonus and the mouthfeel and head retention from all the minerals is fantastic and really pushes it up to the level of great alcohol free beer. \n\nThis year I'm going to experiment with small amounts of roast malt and crystal malt for a bit more beer flavour, but if anyone is interested in more information or to try it if they live near any woods with birch I strongly recommend giving it a try.

{"title": "Help! Keg Ferment Clog", "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI was hoping this wouldn't be the title of my first post here, but here goes. I am urgently reaching out for suggestions. I've been going through a lot of the posts on this forum and others, and have recently decided to rebuild my brewing setup using a keg for fermentation.  \n\nI built my desired setup for now with a flotit 2.0 floating dip tube, Maxheadroom gas fitting, and a gas QD going to some PVC line and out into a jar of starsan. I have seen many folks suggest this. I was hoping to add a spunding valve to this after the ferm slowed a bit to naturally carb. \n\nAfter a couple of days of rip-roaring fermentation, I noticed today (day 3) that some krausen had made its way into the tubing and it is now somewhat clogged (being pushed along very slowly by the CO2 output). I tried to release a little out of the PRV (I did this very slowly based on others horror stories). I did not get an explosion but I did get a lot of pressure trying to escape and eventually more yeasty krausen coming out. Now I am trying to figure out the best way to unclog this whole situation and get back to some resemblance of finishing the ferm for this beer while not leaving the yeast under a crazy amount of pressure or introducing too much oxygen. Should I just fully vent the PRV yeast and then clean/reassemble the gas post and QD to hose line? \n\nRecipe is a 4.5 gal IPA w/ roughly 10 lb of grain, and 12 oz of added sugar.. \n\nI did add the recommended amount of fermcap both to the boil and to the keg before yeast pitch. I do wonder if the added sugar just set the yeast off or if doing an IPA like this should be done at 4gal. I also added about 1.5 oz of hops at 150 degrees while cooling the wort, so there is definitely a good amount of hop sludge and possible hop creep contributing. \n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and I guess this kind of forced me to be part of the conversation, which I was hoping to join anyway, albeit with a more successful story.   \n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j9zfe3/help_keg_ferment_clog/", "created_utc": 1741825852.0, "score": 2, "author": "Dripping_Champagne", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j9zfe3/help_keg_ferment_clog/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

A kind of astringency or bitterness that I can't really figure out where it comes from (somewhere between, astringent, peppery, chemical, or clove like, and mouth puckering). It might be part of the yeast character, or it may be the malt itself. What makes me a bit confused is that  \n1) I used two different yeasts, S04 in a brown ale and Lallemand Munich Classic for a Dunkles Weizen. So maybe it's the CS1, since that is the common factor?  \n2) I had a similar astringency in a Belgian blonde I made with WB-06, and that was definitely the yeast, since it didn't have anything in it besides pilsner malt and white sugar. So maybe it's the yeast, since all three yeast types are somewhat related (I think? At least the Belgian and the Weizen yeasts). And maybe I'm not treating the yeasts quite right. The S04 was fermented towards the higher end, while the Munich Classic was towards the lower end.  \n3) But then again, the brown actually mellowed out over time, and became decent after about two months in the bottle. (The Dunkles Weizen is not there yet, and this remains to be seen). Whereas the blonde did not mellow out substantially (maybe a little bit).\n\nSo what I'm asking is whether you guys have any experience with this in relation to CS1 malt? \n\nI might try to make an experimental batch to test it out. 3 or 4% of CS1 together with simple pilsner malt, and fermented with US-05, which I know how to handle well.

And after drinking some of my most recent brew, I can categorically say I have had my first out and out failure. \n\nIt started with an all grain kit for an 18% stout. I've never managed to get the starting gravity just right,but it is usually close enough that I don't stress about it. This time it was so low, I added almost 2kg of sugar to bring the SG up to the suggested level. I added the yeast, put the lid on the fermenter, and into the hot press it went. Approx 10 days later there was a storm that cut power for days. The temp obviously dropped, but I was hopeful that when it came back up yeast activity would restart. \n\nThis did not happen , and after 2 weeks of no change in gravity (2 to 3 days of getting it back up to temp a week of no change, and 2 to 3 days to get new yeast) , I bit the bullet and added fresh yeast. There was a small improvement however the gravity stopped dropping at a point that left the brew around 13.5%. nothing to be sneezed at, but a long way from 18%.\n\nI bottled the black treacle I had in my fermenter and left it to bottle condition.

It's so hard to research anything about it through google so if you've tried this or have heard of someone trying it, please tell because my dumb little alcoholic autist mind is swarming with possibilities of unique combinations of flavor or even some kind of selective process for the yeast organisms themselves.

{"title": "ATACC. My creation after 2 years of development", "selftext": "Hello all, I just want to share what I've been working on. I call it \"ATACC\" or to be more specific the \"Automated Temperature And Coolant Controller\". It's a one size fits all control system that will automate essentially any still of any size wether it's a diy still or a commercial made one. It adapts in real time and can deal with a variety of things from unstable water pressure to power failures. I am currently working various hardware addons for fully automated cuts and emergency shutdown relays. To install it all you have to do is put it in between your water supply and your still (there are two 1/4 barb fittings on each side that you just connect your water to one end and the still to the other. Then just slot the thermal probe into wherever you want to measure, all without the need for any tools.) there is also an optional web interface where you can configure and control every aspect of how ATACC behaves and fine tune it for your specific setup as this device can work on pretty much anything assuming you configure it properly. There are currently around 10 prototypes in circulation being used with testers from simple T500 all the way up to large scale 65L and 100L stills and all seem to be reporting overwhelmingly positive feedback. I guess the reason I'm making this post is because I want to hear from you guys what would you want this device to be capable of assuming you had one. What questions do you have for me? If you want I can show videos of it doing a full distillation start to finish when operating on less than ideal conditions. I'll try and answer to the best of my abilites. going forward I will continue support via software updates and eventually make an entire ecosystem of hardware and software around ATCC.\n\nIve included images and more in depth documentation about what it is, what its capable of and how it works at the link below. there is simply no way I can explain everything in a single post.\nhttps://migdynamics.ca/pages/guides-and-tutorials\n\nTLDR: what do you think?

{"title": "Extract Kit, SRM, Hop Utilization, & BrewFather", "selftext": "So, after my first home brew, I noticed the color was a bit darker than anticipated. Still had the taste I was expecting for the most part, but color was pretty dark for a light golden ale, and definitely darker than what Brewfather was expecting.\n\nThis is when I learned that using extract kits, especially LME, can lead to a darker color of the brew. From this, I also learned that some people counter this by putting some of the LME in before the boil and then the remainder later in the boil / right after taking it off the boil. Makes sense, but then it was also mentioned how this can impact the IBU of the brew as well.\n\nSo.. I just got a Vanilla Cream Ale extract kit, which is using all LME. I would like to have a little lighter color, but I also really don't want to mess up the bitterness on this one either.\n\nHow can I account for this in Brewfather? I am still very new to using this, so I can't figure out exactly how I might be able to play around with it to make sure everything is accruate.\n\nMy current recipe is a 2.5 gallon batch.

{"title": "keg options", "selftext": "So I was wondering what the community's opinions are on the small .5 to 2.5 gallon kegs you can get on Amazon for about $90 for the whole kit with a regulator and spigot and about $45 for just the keg, like this one: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HM7KL2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HM7KL2) Looks like there's another part with the ball locks on top that would be necessary to fill the keg.  The biggest down side I see is the need to remove the filling and serving devices and screw on caps, but If it was purged with CO2 I don't see oxygen being a big problem.  A secondary downside is that everything out there seems to use screw-on CO2 cartridges, which are considerably more expensive than the usual ones.\n\nI bought 4 corny's last week from a warehouse over in Bakersfield that had 11 pallets of them from a kombucha company that went out of business.  My original intent was to get one to do forced carbonation with but they were pretty cheap - $20 each.  Now of course I'm replacing the O-rings and the little sniglets on the bail that help set the pressure the lid seals with.  Three of them had the second gas port and a diffusion \"stone\".  \n\nBut beyond the forced carbonation and bottling with a beer gun, I don't have a Keezer yet.  I do have a separate fridge out in the shop that's used for storing extra food but also industrial stuff like keeping epoxies and silicones cold to inhibit curing, and it's a dual door fridge, so not an ideal conversion to beer use anyway.

OG of 1.046 and FG of 1.009, for an ABV of 4.86.%. Started the bottling process last night.\n\nEverything was going great. Cleaned, sanitized, auto-siphon was working great.

All of a sudden a big pocket of air gets into the siphon, and I couldn't get it to flow back down into the bottling back. And boom, the air hits the primary, and I push air bubbles through my beer. Completely aerated the shit out of it. It was brief, but probably big enough to screw up my batch.\n\nAt this point, I have 4.1 gallons or so in my bottling bucket, and I decide.. I'm done.

{"title": "First brew experience with a Brewzilla and Fermzilla", "selftext": "I\u2019ve made three batches of home-brew that were extract kits, one that had steeping grains, one that was all dry, and one that was a mix of liquid and dry extract.\u00a0 Used a turkey fryer, carboys, and a Costco\u00a0 bin full of ice water to get the temp down after the boil.\u00a0 Never had any issues other than not being able to hit OG and one boil over.\u00a0 Brew day usually took about 4 hrs start to finish, and was pretty hectic.\n\nGot a Brewzilla for Christmas, and coupled it with a Fermzilla.\u00a0 Figured if nothing else, the higher precision of the controller, and some of the ease in working with the Fermzilla would up my game.\n\nFor this brew we decided to use the controller manually as opposed to creating a profile and running from that. \u00a0\n\nFirst brew was a Belgian from the Ballast Point Homebrew Mart in San Diego.\u00a0 11.75lb of grain, 2 oz of hops, and yeast.\u00a0 Recipe called for 2.74 gal Strike water at 159 degrees for 60 minutes; 5.7 gal of spare water at 168 degrees, and a boil target of 6.7 gal for 90 minutes.\u00a0 This is where we ran in to our first issues.\u00a0 The grain absorbed all 2.74 gal of strike water and became impossible to stir.\u00a0 We then started adding more of the sparge water until we could work the grains and they were saturated and submerged.\u00a0 That used 4.7 gal in total, and we cooked the mash at approximately the target temperature, for an hour. \u00a0\n\nSo a lot of people have reported the pump clogging.\u00a0 We thought we had this problem, until we noticed that the liquid level in the grain pipe rose significantly when the pump caveated.\u00a0 We then realized this was not a clog, but that we were pulling liquid from below the false bottom faster than the wort could percolate through.\u00a0 So, when the space below the false bottom fills, you can run the pump until it\u2019s nearly empty, and then you just have to wait.\u00a0 Evidently you can set the pump duty cycle but I haven\u2019t figured that out yet.\n\nWe had the Brewzilla set up on a very low table, but had to use a step stool and two of us to pull the grain pipe up.\u00a0 12 pounds of grain and 40 pounds of water\u2026.So here\u2019s something that I\u2019ve not seen discussed in any of the other write ups or the Brewzilla literature:\u00a0 It will take an hour or more for the grain pipe to drain.\u00a0 We poured the remaining sparge water through during that time.\u00a0 Got us to the 6.7 boil target, so that was pretty accurate. \u00a0\n\nSet the grain pipe aside, turned the controller up to 212 degrees.\u00a0 We\u2019re at 4500 feet, so when I tested the equipment, it would only get to 209.\u00a0 Today it got almost to 211.\u00a0 It did not create a real vigorous boil.\u00a0 So here\u2019s a question - when does the timer start for the boil? \u00a0 Because it took more than an hour to hit 210.\u00a0 The rest of the boil went as planned with a small exception - in several videos brewers have put a hop spider in the pump flow to catch a lot of the vegetable matter.\u00a0 Halfway through mine clogged completely.\u00a0 We dumped it back in and shortly thereafter it clogged again.\u00a0 This time we just put the hose in and let it overflow. \u00a0\n\nThe cool down:\u00a0 One of the things I did not check was the cooling setup.\u00a0 Seemed pretty simple, attach some 1/2\u201d vinyl tubing to the coil with a couple of hose clamps, and put garden hose adapters on the other ends with hose clamps.\u00a0 Well, it leaked like a sieve.\u00a0 Kegland should have beaded the ends of the coil.\u00a0 I tightened the clamps as much as practical, and they still leaked.\u00a0 The hose ends leaked so badly that I had to stick them in a homer bucket.\u00a0 I could reduce the leakage by reducing the inlet pressure and flow.\u00a0 That actually helped the cooling because it keeps the water in the coils longer to pick up more heat.\u00a0 Still, it took more than an hour to get into the mid-60s. \u00a0\n\nUsed the Brewzilla\u2019s pump to transfer the wort into the Fermzilla and hit another snag and something else not real obvious - to close that valve at the bottom takes a *serious* amount of force.\u00a0 Filled the jar with wort, killed the pump, disassembled dumped it back in and then tried to figure out the butterfly valve.\u00a0 After filling the Fermzilla, we ended up with six gallons - one more than expected - even though we left the lid off during the boil and it was only about 50 degrees in the garage and we used the amount of water called for in the recipe.\u00a0 Missed OG - was supposed to be 1.059, was 1.045.\u00a0 Dumped in an entire bottle of Karo syrup trying to bring it up but only got to 1.047.\u00a0 Pitched the yeast, added a half teaspoon of Fermaid and put in an airlock.\u00a0 Tomorrow I\u2019m going to figure out how to set the spunding valve. \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also much, much darker than a typical Belgian. \u00a0\n\nComments?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j2cfww/first_brew_experience_with_a_brewzilla_and/", "created_utc": 1740983269.0, "score": 18, "author": "swampcholla", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j2cfww/first_brew_experience_with_a_brewzilla_and/", "html_title": ""}

Hooking it up, starting a low psi, and then gradually increasing to get to 20 psi and leaving for 24 hours.\nUnfortunately - no results again.\n\nSo I hooked it back up again and tried a more forceful method of dialing it up to 30 psi and leaving for 12 hours.\nSome bubbles - but nothing worth noting. Basically, it's still flat.\nIt shoots out of the keg (I release the pressure beforehand) and there is plenty of foam, but nothing that hangs around.\n\n\nRight now, I am at a loss.\nI have checked there are no leaks.\nThe keg has worked fine before and I can definitely hear gas going in.\nI have cleared the head space multiple times to make sure all oxygen is out.\nThe only thing I will note, is that the scotch & coke is not cold - I know a lot of guides say the lower temp will help with the carbonation, but I figured given the time I am leaving it for it shouldn't be an issue.\nMy issue is my fridge isn't big enough to have the keg AND the extra gas bottle in at the same time.\n\nAny help anyone can offer would be much appreciated.\nThanks guys!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j2cdfj/carbonating_spirits_with_diffusion_stone/", "created_utc": 1740982978.0, "score": 5, "author": "TurkeySlapa", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/1j2cdfj/carbonating_spirits_with_diffusion_stone/", "html_title": ""}
