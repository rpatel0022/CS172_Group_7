{"title": "Starbucks guide by a 1200isplenty barista", "selftext": "I see Starbucks recipes and ideas on here all the time. As a barista for a few years, I thought I'd make a guide. After all, 'tis the (pumpkin spice) season! \n\n\nThe goal of this guide is to get lowest calorie options, while still being yummy and, most importantly... still getting caffeine.\n\n\nThe biggest and most common sense/well known is to get a black coffee instead of a latte, but that's not always satisfying. These are just some suggestions, not official starbucks recipes or info. \n\nOther biggest quick tips:\n\n1) Ask for sugar free where possible (vanilla, cinnamon dolce, mocha)\n\n2) Ask for lower calorie milks. Almond and coconut are the lowest, with nonfat dairy milk being the lowest for no extra charge. \n\n3) Try to go for a smaller size when possible/doable. Hot grande and venti sized espresso drinks usually get the same amount of espresso, so just get the grande! Or, ask for extra espresso (there's a charge for this, varies by store). \n\n4) Ask for less pumps (our drinks are usually too sweet anyways) and skip the whip. \n\n\n\n\nLattes: \n\nA latte is espresso and steamed milk, with light foam. \n\nTry a misto instead! A tall latte, for example, would be 1 oz espresso and about 11 oz (2%) milk for a total of 12 oz and 150 calories. A misto gets about 6 oz brewed coffee and 6 oz milk for 80 calories. The misto also has much more caffeine, 150 mg vs ~75 mg in the latte. You can lessen the calories further by asking for a little more coffee than milk, or choosing a lower calorie milk option. You can also ask for a black coffee with steamed milk for the same texture. \n\nFrom here, you can add any of the same flavors you normally love. There will be a calorie guide for the syrups and milks at the bottom, of course! \n\n\nMacchiatos:  \n\nA Starbucks macchiato is... pretty much a layered latte. If you go elsewhere, it'll be espresso with a dash of steamed milk.\n\nMacchiatos are harder to replicate with a replacement. Truly the only things to do here are to get one with sugar free syrups and lower calorie milks. \n\nCappuccino \n\nEspresso with steamed milk, heavier on the foam. \n\nCappuccinos are really similar to lattes, however the more foam the lighter the calories. \n\n\nFraps: \n\nThese are basically milkshakes and are one of the hardest to make low calorie, especially since they discontinued the light base. There's a few things you can do: \n\n* Ask for light or no whip cream\n\n* Ask for the sugar free syrups/lower calorie milks\n\n* Ask for less base (but I wouldn't cut more than half the base, it'll affect the texture too much)\n\n* Ask they use cold brew instead of milk. My location will do this, I am not sure if others will. \n\n*Add espresso (extra charge!) or extra coffee. Coffee is almost calorie free, while milk is not. \n\n\n\nTeas:\n\nTeas are easy, just don't get them sweetened. You can add stevia/splenda/whatever you want to sweeten it. The infusions (strawberry, peach, pineapple flavors) are calorie free. There's sadly no way to lessen the impact of lemonade except not getting it or asking for lemonade to the infusion line and water to the juice line. \n\n\nRefreshers: \n\nThese come in concentrates, so there's nothing we can do except add extra water (which will obviously water them down). I'd suggest getting a white tea with a splash of the infusion of choice. You may or may not get charged for the splash. \n\n\n\nSyrup Guide, Calories per pump (had to do some math using the SB website, these are estimates) \n\n\n* Sugar free vanilla/cinnamon dolce: 0 calories \n\n* Sugar free mocha: ~8 calories \n\n* Vanilla: 15 calories \n\n* Mocha: 30 calories\n\n* Cinnamon Dolce: 25 calories\n\n* Caramel: 15 calories\n\n* Classic: 20 calories\n\n* Toffeenut: 20 calories\n\n* Pumpkin spice: 35 calories\n\n* White mocha: 47 calories\n\n* Caramel drizzle: ~15 calories, depends on how heavy handed the barista is. (Super rough estimate just based on the website menu)\n\nTalls: 3 pumps\n\nGrandes: 4 pumps\n\nVenti: 5 pumps\n\nVenti (iced): 6 pumps\n\nTrenta: 7 pumps\n\nSubtract one pump for machiattos, cappucinos, and blonde espresso drinks. \n\n\nMilks, calories per cup: \n\n* Almond: 60 calories\n\n* Coconut: 80 calories\n\n* Nonfat: 90 calories\n\n* 2%: 120 calories\n\n* Soy: 130 calories\n\n* Whole: 140 calories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended drinks, calories listed for grandes: \n\n\n* London fog with sugar free vanilla and coconut milk. 80 calories\n\n* Iced coffee with sugar free vanilla and choice of milk (2% add 30 calories. I usually use coconut, which would be closer to 15/20). \n\n* Skinny vanilla latte with coconutmilk, iced. 100 calories\n\n* Iced coffee with 2 pumps sugar free mocha, 2 pumps toffeenut, caramel and sea salt topping. ~ 55 calories +calories from any milk or cream added. \n\n\n\"But sugarfree syrups taste terrible!\" I have to wonder if the ability to taste that \"aftertaste\" is genetic like tasting cilantro as soapy, because I've never experienced it. However, I'd recommend using our stevia packets for sweetness and our condiment bar for flavor. If you mix cinnamon and stevia, it'll replicate our cinnamon dolce decently. Other than that, there's not a whole lot you can do to replicate any flavors. \n\n\n\n\"But I don't want to be *that person* when I order!!!\" Truly and honestly, most of us don't care. If you pay $5+ for a drink, you should get what you want! But sometimes social anxiety (or whatever you hold back may be) gets the best of us. I get it. \n\nHere's some drinks that are simple to order and decently low calorie: \n\n* Skinny vanilla latte. 130 calories\n\n* Skinny mocha. 170 calories \n\n* Iced cinnamon almondmilk macchiato. 200 calories\n\n* Iced coconutmilk mocha macchiato. 210 calories\n\n* Iced vanilla bean coconut milk latte. 140 calories\n\n* Iced skinny cinnamon dolce latte. 80 calories\n\n\n\nAs for food, I would just avoid us. You can get better low-calorie food for cheaper. If you REALLY need to, though, I'd grab the reduced fat turkey bacon. It's very filling (decent amount of protein) and 230 calories.  \n\n\nIf I've made a mistake, typo'd, etc. Just let me know, I just got off a shift, ironically enough. I also work at a license store and not a corporate store, and our policies may be different. \n\nIf you want me to make your regular drink skinny, leave me a comment and I'll try my best! \n\n\n\nETA: \nhttps://www.starbucks.com/menu\n\nI used this website to get the calorie info! Just subtract the calories of a plain latte from the flavored latte, divide by 4 pumps for grande, and you get calories per pump.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/9dmyet/starbucks_guide_by_a_1200isplenty_barista/", "created_utc": 1536267144.0, "score": 3248, "author": "napoleonicecream", "num_comments": 295, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/9dmyet/starbucks_guide_by_a_1200isplenty_barista/", "html_title": ""}

A sad fat angry idiot.", "selftext": "I started my senior year of college last fall and it's kicking my butt. I've been an emotional wreck with things going on in my life and I've been struggling so hard not to go back to my old habits.\n\nI used to drink a TON of soda.  I never drank diet, always the sugary kind, and I cut it off cold turkey two years ago when I started living healthier. But last fall I moved into an apartment that's right above a little cafe and I made a habit of going there to study. I don't like coffee so I tried diet coke. I couldn't tell if I had just forgotten what good Coke tasted like or if diet coke is actually just freaking delicious, but it tasted just like I remembered. And since then, almost every day I have gone to this place to drink diet coke and study for hours. I know diet soda may not be the best for you but it always felt like \"hey, at least it's not sugary soda/alcohol/etc\" to justify it to myself.   And I looked forward to it every day.  I never bought it to drink at my apartment because I was afraid I'd binge it, so my rule was - only while studying. Most nights I get one refill, if I'm there particularly late sometimes I get a second refill, so three tall glasses total with ice.\n\nRecently a new girl was at the counter and when I ordered she said they didn't have diet. I asked if they stopped having it completely or were just temporarily out, she said she's new and has to ask. She came back and said they've never had diet. So I'm confused and told her I've been drinking it here every day for a long time. She went to ask again and the cook came out to clarify, he apologized and said they've never had diet and explained that the owner hates artificial sweeteners and doesn't want to stock it. So I asked what I've been drinking for months and he gritted his teeth and asked if Monica was serving me (she was, every day) and he said she was probably just giving me regular (and some stuff about how she's super lazy and was crap to customers and they fired her).  \n\nSo I ordered a regular Coke, just to see, and yep. That's what I've been drinking. By my estimates I've drank eleven freaking pounds worth of coke. The guy was super apologetic but I feel like an idiot. No wonder I can't seem to keep weight off.\n\nSo now I know, and I'm just disappointed.

People mentioned feeling emotionally distressed and angry from the lack of food on a regular basis.

Lots of pats on the back were given to each other for tolerating these feelings, to make it worse. \n\nThis is not a pro-ana sub. This is not a starvation sub. It\u2019s very sad to me to see that quite a lot of people feel the need to use it like one. \n\n1200 is typically the bare minimum suggested for women on a diet. If you\u2019re more muscular, more active, heavier, taller, a man, or dealing with any number of other factors, you may not do well with such a low count. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use this sub for ideas. But if you feel horrible because of your restricting regularly, even when you\u2019re avoiding things like empty carbs, 1200 is not for you! And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You can lose weight at a lot of different calorie levels - it depends on what your body needs, which you can calculate online based on your activity level, height, weight and gender. If you eat less than that, you will lose weight, if maybe more slowly. \n\nJust sharing in the hopes that this might help some people.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/7mczum/feeling_hungry_and_terrible_on_a_regular_basis_is/", "created_utc": 1514351245.0, "score": 2626, "author": "None", "num_comments": 185, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/7mczum/feeling_hungry_and_terrible_on_a_regular_basis_is/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sticking to Your Calorie Limit While You're High as Fuck", "selftext": "So, as a warning, I'm currently waiting for my edibles to kick in. If things get weird halfway through this guide, I'm so so sorry.\n\nMunchies. They're amazing. As 1200isplenty's resident trash stoner, I'm gonna be the first to say: Eating while high is one of the best things in the world. Things taste so GOOD and your stomach starts growling and wow, grubhub is a thing. But I'm here to save you. Here's how I keep my calorie goal while being blazed out of my mind:\n\n* Plan your highs! I get high on the weekend, so I plan for the munchies. I'll eat half of my dinner because I know I'm gonna want to eat the other half later. It's also a good idea to have your Snack Plan (TM) set out ahead of time so you don't get swayed by the concept of online ordering.\n* What I've found is that when I'm high, it's less about taste and more about *texture*. I want to switch back and forth between the stoned food groups: **Crunchy, bready, cold, and chocolate.** This is (at least in my experience) why I tend to overeat while high -- I want all the types of food one after another. But instead of going fucking apeshit on all the snacks, eat a little at a time. Make a charcuterie board of snacks. Little nibbles will satisfy you.\n* **Crunchy:** Crunchy things are SO GOOD. Ideas: those flavored rice cakes (the caramel ones :0), saltines (it's boring but hits the spot), POPCORN (with spices like paprika omg), flavored nuts, roasted chickpeas, those weird snap pea crisps. Also, secret star: Bell peppers. Holy shit I love bell peppers when I'm high. They somewhat mix into the \"cold\" category but DAMN, they are cronchy and feel so nice to eat. Big fan. Put some hummus on that. Maybe if you like baby carrots you can eat those too but I think they taste bad even when I'm sober lmao. (Note: pls be careful cutting vegetables while high it's really difficult)\n* **Bready:** Bring back popcorn here because omg. Kettle corn is good because you can eat a shitton of it and put spices on it and it's awesome. Also saltines again I'm sorry. I was once super high and dipped saltines into balsamic vinagrette?? Weirdly good. Also, I'll legit just eat a slice of bread. I think that low-cal bread from the grocery is basically indistinguishable from normal bread, so I'll just eat a slice of it. Also they make these honey wheat 70 cal wrap things and sometimes I'll put a lil peanut butter on that and a drizzle of honey and that's awesome. And maybe a few chocolate chips or some cereal too on the wrap for some cronch.\n* **Cold:** This is my favorite food category when I'm high because of the diversity. Bell peppers are good, those tiny baby cheese wheels are good, a spoonful of hummus like the monster you are, etc. etc. And *popsicles*. Wow. I have some strawberry popsicles in my fridge at like \\~80 cals each and I'm so excited to eat them later tonight. Popscilces are extra good because they take a while to eat so you can really savor the experience and texture. Also!!! Berries. Hooooly shit berries are so good when high. They basically taste like fun candies??? Fun cold candy that explodes in ur mouth?? Wow. Raspberries are my favorite.\n* **Chocolate:** Okay this one is the hardest imo. Those chocolate rice cake crackers are really good for this, but like last month I found my secret weapon: Chocolate frozen yogurt popsicles. They're 100 cals and like I said above, frozen treats are great because they take a while to eat so you can't go nuts with them. They are COLD and chocolately and are milkshakes on a stick. 10/10, chef's kiss. Also, you can totally just eat a handful of chocolate chips, nobody is going to stop you. Or like, a few at a time to satisfy your chocolate needs.\n* Note: Your brain is going to tell you that those edibles you ate were REALLY tasty and you should eat more of them. This is *trickery*. *Don't fucking do it.* You will *die*.\n\nAnyways, I guess what I'm saying is that high munchies don't have to be all high calorie (hehe). Play to the strengths of being stoned: that everything is going to taste like the best shit you've ever had!! Savor a raisin. Live your best life.\n\nAlso, something that helps me but might not be good advice: If you're so stoned you can't leave the couch, you can't go to the kitchen to get snacks. Modern problems require modern solutions. Maybe don't do this though idk.\n\nedit: okay i'm very high. i think i should add a fifth category called ??? because it's just the craziest textures you've ever eaten. like whipped cream, or jello. because what the fuck\n\nedit next morning: hi, sober me here to remind you to also drink water because damn. thanks for all the support friends!! love u all, enjoy responsibly", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/msf8m5/sticking_to_your_calorie_limit_while_youre_high/", "created_utc": 1618615668.0, "score": 2473, "author": "piratedeathmatch", "num_comments": 207, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/msf8m5/sticking_to_your_calorie_limit_while_youre_high/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "You cannot trust McDonald's non-fat drinks.", "selftext": "Source: I am a McDonald's employee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, what you need to know is how our milk systems work for our McCafe drinks, (lattes, macchiato, hot chocolate etc.) Underneath the espresso machine you see us making your specialty drinks at, there is a cooler. In the cooler is two baskets. One basket holds a bag of non-fat milk, the other holds the whole milk. There are nozzles that hook each bag up to the machine so the machine will pull the correct type of milk when prompted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the problem. We order way more whole milk than non-fat. So we routinely run out of non-fat. What do we do when that happens? Tell people we can't make non-fat drinks? Nope. We put a bag of whole milk in the non-fat basket, hook it up and pretend it's non-fat milk. You'll never notice, because we hit the \"non-fat\" buttons, it just gives us whole milk instead. We are told by our managers to do this. I was told off when I was new and told someone we were out of non-fat. I was told to make it with whole and not say anything to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only way you can actually verify we're giving you non-fat milk in your drink is to ask us to open the milk cooler under the espresso machine to see if the correct colored nozzles on the milk bags are hooked up to the correct color connector to the machine. (Red is whole, blue is non-fat.) And let me tell you, very few, if any McDonald's are gonna open that cooler for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: When you order a non-fat drink from McDonalds, there are ZERO ways of knowing that you actually got non-fat and it's ENTIRELY possible your drink was made with whole milk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure how this works out in calories, but it felt like something people should know.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/acap6f/you_cannot_trust_mcdonalds_nonfat_drinks/", "created_utc": 1546552318.0, "score": 1825, "author": "mcdonaldslies", "num_comments": 191, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/acap6f/you_cannot_trust_mcdonalds_nonfat_drinks/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "A Simple Hack to Tell If a Food Is Actually High in Protein", "selftext": "I recently came across this protein trick and wanted to see what you all think.\n\nTake the grams of protein per serving and add a zero to it. If that number is greater than or equal to the total calories per serving, it\u2019s supposedly a high-protein food.\n\nFor example:  \n**Tuna** \u2013 16g of protein, 110 calories. Add a zero \u2192 160. Since 160 is greater than 110, it qualifies as high protein.  \n**Kodiak Pancake Mix** \u2013 15g of protein, 220 calories. Add a zero \u2192 150. Since 150 is less than 220, it\u2019s not as protein-dense as it might seem.\n\nIn theory, this seems like an easy way to tell if something is actually high in protein or just high in calories *with* protein\u2014but is this really a good measure? Would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nEdit: Wow! Lots of feedback! I want to emphasize that this hack isn\u2019t a strict rule to follow, but rather a way to bring awareness to the fact that not all protein is created equal. Whole foods like eggs, beans, and meat are naturally nutrient-dense, which this trick doesn\u2019t fully account for. However, when it comes to processed protein sources like powders or bars, this method can be really useful for comparing options and understanding their true nutritional value.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1je82t1/a_simple_hack_to_tell_if_a_food_is_actually_high/", "created_utc": 1742312842.0, "score": 1808, "author": "Midnight_Fighter", "num_comments": 117, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/1je82t1/a_simple_hack_to_tell_if_a_food_is_actually_high/", "html_title": ""}

Future app purchases will go a long way to support photographing more foods (junk food and vegan foods are now on the top of my list), adding more features (comparing foods, explicit categories, and different sorts seem to be the big requests) and yes, Android users, making a version for you. \n\nIf you\u2019ve come after the giveaway, I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d consider buying the app. It\u2019s my goal to keep it about the price of a coffee and I hope that can work with all of you. \n\nI\u2019ll continue to check in for more feedback and answer any questions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/kp11p0/i_never_understood_how_many_calories_were_in_my/", "created_utc": 1609607082.0, "score": 1808, "author": "H-H-H-H-H-H", "num_comments": 265, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/kp11p0/i_never_understood_how_many_calories_were_in_my/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Crisis Cobbler(120ish cals depending on serving size)", "selftext": "Heya, first time posting here , but I've used a ton of recipes, so thought its time I give back. Apologies if formatting is garbage, I've never posted like this. \n\n I have a  crazy sweets craving, and instead of fighting it like I've done most of my life, I've figured out healthier recipes. I got laid off a couple of weeks ago, and this Cobbler has been keeping me from eating worse things, because I know if I gain the weight back(lost 130lbs a few years ago) on top of the state of the world and my life, its gonna suck way worse. \n\nSo, behold my crisis cobbler(name still up in the air but I am in a state of crisis and it is a Cobbler so there it is). It can be made in about 15 mins in the microwave and can be customized in a bunch of ways. It comes out to around 120 cals when you split it into 3 servings. I usually also eat mine with carb smart ice cream which is 100 cals for 3/4 cup, you could skip it or replace with sugar free whipped topping or whatever. \n\nIngrediets: \n-Flour 5 tablespoons\n\n-Baking Powder 1 tsp\n\n-Salt 2 tsp(I always add a bit more salt than most recipes call for so this might be too much for you, idk)\n\n-Frozen fruit of choice 2 cups(I've been using great value antioxidant berry blend, but have also used cherries and a pre-cooked cinnamon apples I make for my oatmeal)\n\n-Corn Starch 1 tbsp(could probably also use a different thickening agent like a bit of xanthan gum or tapioca starch but I haven't tried it)\n\n- Milk of choice about 1/4 cup, I use unsweetened almond milk(but just to make it into a thick pancake batter consistency so add a bit, then mix, and add more if necessary)\n\n-Granulated Sweetener of choice approx 3 tbsp for the fruit mixture and another 2 or 3 for the crust(I use store brand splenda)\n\n-Brown Sugar Substitute, 2 to 3 tbsp(Not required, but I love the splenda magic baker brown sugar lately, if you dont use this, add a bit more granulated to your crust)\n\n-Butter/Margarine/Oil/Butter flavor extract 1-2 tbsp OR a tsp for the extract(This isn't necessary, but the butter flavor in the crust is nice. Obviously your choice will affect the cal count, extract being the lowest of course, I have even used a spritz of butter flavored oil on top just before cooking)\n\n-Vanilla Extract 1-2 tbsp, I feel like you can never have too much vanilla\n\n-Optional: Add a bit of lemon extract or lemon juice into the fruit mix and it brightens up the flavor\n\nStep 1: Using a wide shallow microwave safe container, mix your frozen fruit with the corn starch and a couple of tbsp of sweetener. How much sweetener is up to you and how sweet you want it. Add a few tablespoons of water and mix some more, the more water you add the longer it will cook, but you get more of the jam stuff which I like. Optional: Lemon extract or lemon juice, a tsp of extract or a couple tbsp of juice. \nPlace in microwave for 5 minutes, or until fruit has thickened into a jam/pie filling like consistency, stirring in between rounds of microwaving. \n\nStep 2: Make your crust. In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt, granulated sweetener, brown sugar substitute, oil or butter or butter extract, vanilla, and milk. We want it to be a thick pancake batter consistency, just pourable but easy to spread if need be. Be careful not too add too much liquid or it will have to be microwaved for too long and the edges will be rubbery by the time the middle is cooked. \n\nStep 3: Pour crust mix evenly over the pre cooked fruit mix and place in the microwave starting at a minute at a time, checking for doneness in between. Cook just until there are no wet spots remaining or a toothpick inserted into the crust part comes out clean. If you cook it too long it will become chewy. \n\nAnd that's it. You can use any kind of fruit as mentioned, though I'd stay away from bananas and citrus as that sounds really gross in this application \ud83d\ude2c \n\nSorry if the formatting and pictures are shit, I've never posted a single recipe anywhere.

Captain D's: 2 lemon pepper fish filets, 4 sides of brocolli (or green beans): 440-640 (depending on sides) Cal \n\n3. Cheddars Scratch Kitchen: 2 lemon pepper fish filets, southern green beans, sweet baby carrots: 587 Cal\n\n4. Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen: 5 blackened chicken tenders, 1 side mashed potatoes, 1 biscuit: 600 Cal (I actually prefer to get 2 orders of 3 tenders and 2 sides of mashed potatoes and I give the biscuits to the birds. Thats 556 Cal)\n\n5. Chick-Fil-A: Spicy Chicken Sandwich + Kale Crunch: 630 Cal (not as filling, but not bad)\n\nThose are my Go-Tos.

Actually that's considered an \"extreme\" deficit where I'll lose 7lbs/week but I super highly doubt it; probably 2lbs is optimistic. I feel like I need to include that because 1200 isn't plenty for me just just yet. \n\nAll that's pictured is 650 calories, including the sauce.\nThe \"dumplings\" came to be 380 total, that's 200 calories of white rice (roughly 1/3 cup cooked rice). Some toppings for flair. The sauce was kind of a lot but I didn't fully know how much I'd end up needing and turns out I needed very little; I'm still considering those calories as consumed nonetheless.\n\nNotes:\nThis amount of \"filling\" made 13 okay-sized \"dumplings\".\n\nIt needed roughly 1/3 head cabbage, but best to start from a fresh head. \n\nTo make roughly two servings of 650 each, I would say make 1 cup of dry rice, & I encourage you to wash it well first. Once done, divide into 3.

I was wrestling with myself for two hours about it because I\u2019m crazy and that\u2019s what binge eating disorder has done to me lol. \n\nFinally, I closed all my food apps and calculated the calories and knew I could easily fit one chicken sandwich from wendy\u2019s into my meal plan. I got the chicken sandwich and a medium coke zero and it filled me up the rest of the evening until I got home. Binge averted! I know this isn\u2019t new advice and it\u2019s not necessarily the best advice but for me it was better to just get one small thing to satisfy the craving than to turn it into a binge. \n\nSo, a non-scale victory for me was disrupting the binge eating behavior and mindset.

A couple times I have eaten 1300. I feel mostly ok! I have energy still. I have experienced headaches and constipation, though nothing extreme, and I expected to feel a little off regardless. Then I am seeing on all my social media about how eating 1200 is what a toddler eats, that my hair will fall out, become at risk for illnesses etc. And more concerningly, so much stuff about how the weight loss itself (which is working, I've lost 2 pounds in a week) is not at all sustainable, because my metabolism will slow down. Some suggest doing the deficit for a while then doing a reverse diet, in which I increase calories slowly and exercise more. Some say I need at least 1500 - some say that's too little too! \n\nI am SO confused. All I want is a way of eating which is effective for yes gradual but still effective weightloss. My goal weight is 33 pounds down - which at 2 pounds a week should take me about 4 months, and if slower about 6. I am fine with this rate - but not if that actually isn't going to happen. I have found so many videos of people saying their weight loss stalled after a few weeks because their calories were too low, and that they needed to exercise more and eat more to make up for it - this is all so much rigmarole. I live a very average lifestyle - I don't really exercise, but I walk. I try to aim for 10000 steps a day but I'm on holiday so haven't been doing that recently. \n\nWhat is the best amount for me to be eating to be able to just continue that way and still lose weight in a way that's not going to take like a year??? I am full on 1200. I am fine, but  I worry the consequences are bad and I don't want to be stuck having to eat more etc or whatever you have to do if the weightloss stalls. Why can't it be simple...\n\nIf you have any guidance please help. I just want to be well.\n\n\\- For reference I am 5'7 and 168 pounds - I believe that puts my basal metabolic rate at 1567 and with activity at 1879 sedentary and 2349 moderate - which I'm somewhere between but it varies by the day! I personally put it to 2200, meaning a 1000 deficit would be 1200 - and even if I'm sedentary some days I worry too much to eat under 1200.

My original goal was to lose about 1.7 lbs a week (1% of my body weight, which is recommended).\n\nI\u2019ve had failed so many times over the past few years, but after a lot of trial and error and losing hope, I finally found a rhythm that works for my body. I\u2019ve been eating a lot of protein, exercising regularly, and doing 16:8. I don't feel hungry but just making smarter food choices.\n\nThis week I dropped to 171 lbs from 175. I know the first few pounds are usually water weight and are easier to lose, but if things keep going like this, I could be down about 15 lbs in 5 weeks. Will this result in loose skin? Especially b/c I am short.\n\nIt was such a struggle to get to this point. The last few months of working out and trying different diets and nothing worked. And now suddenly my body is finally dropping some weight. But I'm worried about loose skin, since I have a belly overhang.\n\nAfter these next 5 weeks, I\u2019ll be going on vacation and plan to pause the diet for a bit.

You could use salt and pepper, chili flakes, nutritional yeast, everything but the bagel\u2014whatever you want. Add chopped pickles, capers, whatever, for more flavor.\n\nThen, for the dressing, you just need a splash of the brine from anything pickled\u2014could be caper brine, pickle brine, pickled onion brine, whatever you want. Or vinegar. Or lemon juice. Then you can add some balsamic glaze or balsamic vinaigrette. That\u2019s truly all you need and it tastes the same, if not SIGNIFICANTLY better than a bottled dressing!!\n\nEDIT: UGHH I FORGOT TO MENTION ADDING DRY HERBS, CRUSHED BLACKBERRIES, AND DIJON MUSTARD, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.

For the family I subbed half whole wheat. So I made 1:1 whole wheat to all purpose flour naan. Delicious, but full calories.\n2.

I don\u2019t actually eat at 1200 - am at maintenance which is slightly higher than that but not massively because I\u2019m quite petite. back when I was cutting months ago, I started learning about calories (and then macros later on) and was shocked at how high calories are in certain foods. I\u2019d admit my relationship with food got quite tricky at some points during that time and because of that I was cooking at home (which allowed me to weigh and track everything) and I had not eaten out at all in months. I\u2019ve been working on getting better at that and have been going out to eat with friends a lot more (when compared to those months when I hadn\u2019t eaten out at all, now I do that roughly 1-2 times a week) and I\u2019ve been really enjoying it! when I first started eating out again I\u2019d only pick the lowest calorie options like a plain side salad when I probably would\u2019ve wanted the burger the most for example. and now I\u2019ve kind of worked out a way which will allow me to order more \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods or foods which I would\u2019ve never allowed myself to have whilst staying under my goals. ik people have mentioned eating less throughout the week to haven higher budget on weekends or before going out for a big meal etc so I guess in that sense my way of doing things is quite similar. however I track macros too, so what I do is for example, if I knew I had plans going to this restaurant with a friend during the weekend, I\u2019d log the option I want to go for along with its macros (eg a pizza that\u2019s 1300 calories) and then the week (or days) building up to that day, I\u2019d log a fraction of that pizza every day (eg 0.1 / 0.25 etc) so in some sense every day I\u2019m saving a bit and then I\u2019m able to have the full pizza when I go out and truly enjoy it rather than tell myself I can only have a bit of that / resort to ordering the lowest calorie side salad on the menu. \nI think this particularly works well when for example it\u2019s a drink / pastry / dessert I\u2019m really craving. the pizza will probably fill me up but often when I have a 400 calorie cake / pastry I probably would get hungry later in the day and this way, I get to enjoy the dessert but also don\u2019t have to make the 400 calorie cut all in one go. \n\nI personally don\u2019t enjoy eating out on my own haha so I guess it works out so that I\u2019d have this meal with my friends planned and I can look forward to and budget for that during the week. idk if anyone else does something similar - I\u2019ve tried this for a couple of weeks now and it seems to be working and that my relationship with food has improved a lot (?) I\u2019d love to hear any thoughts on how people fit eating out / still enjoying food while on some sort of diet. as mentioned, ik some people set lower calorie budgets throughout the week to allow a higher one over the weekend, but for those of you who do something similar, how long of a period would you aim for? I\u2019ve seen people do daily / weekly calorie / macros goals and budgets, but do some of you go even longer than that (eg spread calorie budget over 2 weeks)?\n\nthanks for reading all this I hope it makes sense!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1js55e7/does_anyone_else_do_this_too/", "created_utc": 1743864607.0, "score": 10, "author": "randompoopp", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/1js55e7/does_anyone_else_do_this_too/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019ve been eating 1622 kcal per day, finally started eating good amount  of protein, overall, my eating habits have got way better.\n\nFor some background now: I am a 20 year old female, 168 cm, and previously (before my weight loss journey) my weight was 60-62 kg. I didn\u2019t like it at all, wanted to see myself way leaner, skinnier (somewhere at 55 kg or even 50 kg if I would not be a skeleton).\n\nAccordingly, the app Yazio shows that if I spent for example 100 kcal, then I can eat them back. But how accurately does the phone know that I burned exactly 100 kcal (according to the step counter) if everyone spends a different number of kcal for the same distance? I'm just afraid that the step counter will greatly inflate the number of kcal that I \"burned\", I will decide to eat, because I spent kcal before that, and I will eat more in fact than I spent, thinking that everything is ok. For instance, I look at what I\u2019ve eaten today: including food only, it\u2019s 1836, but including my so-called burned calories (254 burned), it\u2019s a good outcome and I even still have 40 calories left to the point I\u2019d reach 1622 ccal.\n\nThe question is: should I only pay attention to all the \u201ceaten foods\u201d no matter how much I burned calories, or can I actually trust these \u201cburned calories\u201d and just have some extra food without going beyond the deficit?\n\nThank you in advance and take care!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1jscvrs/deficit_question/", "created_utc": 1743885039.0, "score": 0, "author": "YS77777777", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/1jscvrs/deficit_question/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Weight Loss in College Dorm", "selftext": "Bro this stuff is so difficult without a kitchen. Right now I am in my schools freshman dorm which offers no kitchen, and the only cooking appliances we are allowed is a mini fridge and microwave. I've done my best to try and create meals to help aid my weight loss since the dining hall food is both really bad in terms of taste and health which is insane because my school pushes a \"healthy diet healthy lifestyle\". Mostly they serve pizza, fried chicken, burgers, chicken nuggets, fries, and more desserts than food options. Then the only thing the vending machines have are chips and candy bars... I recently gained a bunch of weight from the fact the only foods near me are super high calorie and \"empty calories\" (which I say because a bag of chips or a chocolate bar does not fill me up nor keep me full for any amount of time) The past couple months of eating in the dining hall has resulted in me gaining that Freshman 15... I'm sick of it. \n\nI guess I am asking if anyone has any advice for low cal meals that can be done solely in the microwave. And yes I know salads but there's only so many days in a week i can eat a salad my guy. My favorite one right now is: instant mashed potatoes (1/4 cup dry is 110 cals) with the real goods chicken tenders (130 cals for 4oz) and I add a frozen vegetable mix and some tinned gravy (50cal for 1/4cup) to make like a chicken and potato bowl. My other go to is buying the lean cuisine or healthy choice meals since its quick and they have nice variety for low calories/high protein, but those are quite expensive in my area (about $5-$6 a meal). This is just really inconvenient because I really love to cook, but its quite hard when all I have is a microwave. I move into an apartment in August which has a really great kitchen, so I can't wait to be able to use it lol.\n\nI can't even sneak in like an air fryer or something because my RA will *know*. She catches everything :(\n\nFor reference I am 19yo F, 5'3, and \\~170lbs. I usually sit near 155/160lbs, but I am wanting to really be closer to 130lbs.

{"title": "Crisis Cobbler(120ish cals depending on serving size)", "selftext": "Heya, first time posting here , but I've used a ton of recipes, so thought its time I give back. Apologies if formatting is garbage, I've never posted like this. \n\n I have a  crazy sweets craving, and instead of fighting it like I've done most of my life, I've figured out healthier recipes. I got laid off a couple of weeks ago, and this Cobbler has been keeping me from eating worse things, because I know if I gain the weight back(lost 130lbs a few years ago) on top of the state of the world and my life, its gonna suck way worse. \n\nSo, behold my crisis cobbler(name still up in the air but I am in a state of crisis and it is a Cobbler so there it is). It can be made in about 15 mins in the microwave and can be customized in a bunch of ways. It comes out to around 120 cals when you split it into 3 servings. I usually also eat mine with carb smart ice cream which is 100 cals for 3/4 cup, you could skip it or replace with sugar free whipped topping or whatever. \n\nIngrediets: \n-Flour 5 tablespoons\n\n-Baking Powder 1 tsp\n\n-Salt 2 tsp(I always add a bit more salt than most recipes call for so this might be too much for you, idk)\n\n-Frozen fruit of choice 2 cups(I've been using great value antioxidant berry blend, but have also used cherries and a pre-cooked cinnamon apples I make for my oatmeal)\n\n-Corn Starch 1 tbsp(could probably also use a different thickening agent like a bit of xanthan gum or tapioca starch but I haven't tried it)\n\n- Milk of choice about 1/4 cup, I use unsweetened almond milk(but just to make it into a thick pancake batter consistency so add a bit, then mix, and add more if necessary)\n\n-Granulated Sweetener of choice approx 3 tbsp for the fruit mixture and another 2 or 3 for the crust(I use store brand splenda)\n\n-Brown Sugar Substitute, 2 to 3 tbsp(Not required, but I love the splenda magic baker brown sugar lately, if you dont use this, add a bit more granulated to your crust)\n\n-Butter/Margarine/Oil/Butter flavor extract 1-2 tbsp OR a tsp for the extract(This isn't necessary, but the butter flavor in the crust is nice. Obviously your choice will affect the cal count, extract being the lowest of course, I have even used a spritz of butter flavored oil on top just before cooking)\n\n-Vanilla Extract 1-2 tbsp, I feel like you can never have too much vanilla\n\n-Optional: Add a bit of lemon extract or lemon juice into the fruit mix and it brightens up the flavor\n\nStep 1: Using a wide shallow microwave safe container, mix your frozen fruit with the corn starch and a couple of tbsp of sweetener. How much sweetener is up to you and how sweet you want it. Add a few tablespoons of water and mix some more, the more water you add the longer it will cook, but you get more of the jam stuff which I like. Optional: Lemon extract or lemon juice, a tsp of extract or a couple tbsp of juice. \nPlace in microwave for 5 minutes, or until fruit has thickened into a jam/pie filling like consistency, stirring in between rounds of microwaving. \n\nStep 2: Make your crust. In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt, granulated sweetener, brown sugar substitute, oil or butter or butter extract, vanilla, and milk. We want it to be a thick pancake batter consistency, just pourable but easy to spread if need be. Be careful not too add too much liquid or it will have to be microwaved for too long and the edges will be rubbery by the time the middle is cooked. \n\nStep 3: Pour crust mix evenly over the pre cooked fruit mix and place in the microwave starting at a minute at a time, checking for doneness in between. Cook just until there are no wet spots remaining or a toothpick inserted into the crust part comes out clean. If you cook it too long it will become chewy. \n\nAnd that's it. You can use any kind of fruit as mentioned, though I'd stay away from bananas and citrus as that sounds really gross in this application \ud83d\ude2c \n\nSorry if the formatting and pictures are shit, I've never posted a single recipe anywhere.

No additional exercising done or anything. It is going steady. \n\n**My current advices :** \n\n*- Some days are harder than others, it should not worry you, progress is not linear in these cases due to a lot of factors playing in. Accept that it is harder at times, that some days are more demoralizing (weight not evolving, results not being enough,...)*\n\n*- At times of struggle, focus on food that is both low in calories but also hard to eat in high quantities. Bananas have done wonders for me, I feel kind of stuffed after eating only one of them.* \n\n*- Being back on track is essential, you should not guilt-trip yourself too much over days of failure, even if there's many of them. It's a daily challenge, if the next day you're back into it, you've won.* \n\n**Some physical / medical updates :** \n\n*- Better blood tests, results all fell (mostly) down to normal levels.* \n\n*- Better sleep at night, struggled with breathing initially and even did an apnea medical study.

I used to never have trouble with weight, albeit I had a physical labour job. But even when I switched from that to a wfh job I gained about 10 pounds but I still wasn\u2019t overweight. I\u2019d cook often and go to the gym 4x week. But now I\u2019m in graduate school full time as well as working full time and I\u2019m just struggling. (I realize this is too much and am finding ways to try and change it but the career I want requires a master\u2019s degree and I don\u2019t know how I could afford it otherwise. My job also has incredible benefits and I genuinely enjoy it and feel fulfilled by it). \n\nIt\u2019s like, even the easy, quick recipes require you to go grocery shopping and wash dishes after. And that sounds so lazy, but it\u2019s really hard to find the time now. Like, for example, on Tuesday, I work from 8 AM - 3 PM. I have to immediately get ready once I get off and drive to class from 4-7 PM. The next day I have to be up by 5:30 so I\u2019ll usually have a frozen lean cuisine or if I\u2019m out just order something, because I want to get my 10k steps a day (not just for calories, walking is self care for me). I have a walker under my desk for wfh but I\u2019m often facilitating presentations over zoom so I can only use it once in a while.\n\nThe solution I\u2019m usually given is meal prep during the weekends - but I have to work one weekend day since I have class all day Monday and I\u2019m just so tired on my day off, usually I\u2019m trying to get what I absolutely need done like laundry and buying groceries. Not to mention I have to do my assignments that are usually due Monday. I try to do something social too if possible because I\u2019m an extrovert and it kills me otherwise. Has anyone with a really busy schedule tried one of those meal delivery services, is it worth it? I can afford that. If anyone else has any other solutions, I\u2019d appreciate it - I have lost 7 pounds this far but it\u2019s been a slow crawl. I\u2019m about 140 at 4\u201911 and it doesn\u2019t feel great. \n\nJust to clarify in case anyone shares ideas: I am allergic to avocado so I can\u2019t use that and I generally need to eat dairy free, dairy really destroys my stomach.

{"title": "It is wild how much my body clings to weight if I ever go slightly over maintenance", "selftext": " My pattern has generally been to eat at a 500-calorie deficit on weekdays and maintenance on weekends. Occasionally on weekends I go well over maintenance, so I\u2019m not surprised at all then when I weigh myself and am up a few pounds, especially knowing how our bodies hold water weight after heavy eating. \n\nBut what does always astound me is when I experience what I\u2019m going through right now. Last week for Monday through Friday I stayed within my daily calorie deficit amount. Saturday I went above maintenance by 200 calories. Sunday I ate at maintenance. If you look at a weekly total, I would still be within my overall deficit goal, even with the 200 extra on Saturday. The last two days I have been eating at my usual deficit, exercising, drinking water, all the things you\u2019re supposed to do. \n\nAnd yet still, my weight is up 5 pounds from Friday. Because of 200 measly surplus calories. I know of course that it is still water weight not fat but just, how??? I am just amazed at how irrational the human body is. Math is just not math to a human body, it seems to think like \u201c2 + 2 = 9\u201d. Like girl what? \n\nOh and if it matters, I am still overweight right now. I\u2019ve dropped a reasonable amount this year, but there\u2019s still a ways to go before I\u2019m not overweight. So it\u2019s not like my body needs to hang onto the weight! \n\nEdit to add: I keep getting notifications of comments but then when I look at the post I can only see a couple.

A couple times I have eaten 1300. I feel mostly ok! I have energy still. I have experienced headaches and constipation, though nothing extreme, and I expected to feel a little off regardless. Then I am seeing on all my social media about how eating 1200 is what a toddler eats, that my hair will fall out, become at risk for illnesses etc. And more concerningly, so much stuff about how the weight loss itself (which is working, I've lost 2 pounds in a week) is not at all sustainable, because my metabolism will slow down. Some suggest doing the deficit for a while then doing a reverse diet, in which I increase calories slowly and exercise more. Some say I need at least 1500 - some say that's too little too! \n\nI am SO confused. All I want is a way of eating which is effective for yes gradual but still effective weightloss. My goal weight is 33 pounds down - which at 2 pounds a week should take me about 4 months, and if slower about 6. I am fine with this rate - but not if that actually isn't going to happen. I have found so many videos of people saying their weight loss stalled after a few weeks because their calories were too low, and that they needed to exercise more and eat more to make up for it - this is all so much rigmarole. I live a very average lifestyle - I don't really exercise, but I walk. I try to aim for 10000 steps a day but I'm on holiday so haven't been doing that recently. \n\nWhat is the best amount for me to be eating to be able to just continue that way and still lose weight in a way that's not going to take like a year??? I am full on 1200. I am fine, but  I worry the consequences are bad and I don't want to be stuck having to eat more etc or whatever you have to do if the weightloss stalls. Why can't it be simple...\n\nIf you have any guidance please help. I just want to be well.\n\n\\- For reference I am 5'7 and 168 pounds - I believe that puts my basal metabolic rate at 1567 and with activity at 1879 sedentary and 2349 moderate - which I'm somewhere between but it varies by the day!

{"title": "Cabbage Dumplings", "selftext": "Hihi. \n\nI just want to share this recipe or idea with everyone. My current calorie needs, in a deficit, is 1600. Actually that's considered an \"extreme\" deficit where I'll lose 7lbs/week but I super highly doubt it; probably 2lbs is optimistic. I feel like I need to include that because 1200 isn't plenty for me just just yet. \n\nAll that's pictured is 650 calories, including the sauce.\nThe \"dumplings\" came to be 380 total, that's 200 calories of white rice (roughly 1/3 cup cooked rice). Some toppings for flair. The sauce was kind of a lot but I didn't fully know how much I'd end up needing and turns out I needed very little; I'm still considering those calories as consumed nonetheless.\n\nNotes:\nThis amount of \"filling\" made 13 okay-sized \"dumplings\".\n\nIt needed roughly 1/3 head cabbage, but best to start from a fresh head. \n\nTo make roughly two servings of 650 each, I would say make 1 cup of dry rice, & I encourage you to wash it well first. Once done, divide into 3. For the remaining rice, save for future use and count as 200 calories.\n\n*Some of my cabbage was ripping so some pieces have less filling- just eyeball everything.\n**Honestly if they were much bigger it'd be hard to eat them.\n***Had to cook in two batches.\n\nFilling-\n1/2 lb ground chicken \n1/2 block tofu\n3 tbsp soy sauce \n1/4 cup green onions\npinch of salt \n1/2 tbsp sesame oil\n\nFor all instructions please reference the makers video on another app. The only thing I need to tell you is that the amount of olive oil I put in the pan prior to the first dumpling was 1TEASPOON. I followed all her directions but for less time, like 7 minutes with the lid on.

I was wrestling with myself for two hours about it because I\u2019m crazy and that\u2019s what binge eating disorder has done to me lol. \n\nFinally, I closed all my food apps and calculated the calories and knew I could easily fit one chicken sandwich from wendy\u2019s into my meal plan.

I\u2019ve been eating 1622 kcal per day, finally started eating good amount  of protein, overall, my eating habits have got way better.\n\nFor some background now: I am a 20 year old female, 168 cm, and previously (before my weight loss journey) my weight was 60-62 kg. I didn\u2019t like it at all, wanted to see myself way leaner, skinnier (somewhere at 55 kg or even 50 kg if I would not be a skeleton).\n\nAccordingly, the app Yazio shows that if I spent for example 100 kcal, then I can eat them back. But how accurately does the phone know that I burned exactly 100 kcal (according to the step counter) if everyone spends a different number of kcal for the same distance? I'm just afraid that the step counter will greatly inflate the number of kcal that I \"burned\", I will decide to eat, because I spent kcal before that, and I will eat more in fact than I spent, thinking that everything is ok. For instance, I look at what I\u2019ve eaten today: including food only, it\u2019s 1836, but including my so-called burned calories (254 burned), it\u2019s a good outcome and I even still have 40 calories left to the point I\u2019d reach 1622 ccal.\n\nThe question is: should I only pay attention to all the \u201ceaten foods\u201d no matter how much I burned calories, or can I actually trust these \u201cburned calories\u201d and just have some extra food without going beyond the deficit?\n\nThank you in advance and take care!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1jscvrs/deficit_question/", "created_utc": 1743885039.0, "score": 0, "author": "YS77777777", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/1jscvrs/deficit_question/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "does anyone else do this too\u2026?", "selftext": "hey guys a bit of a random question here. I don\u2019t actually eat at 1200 - am at maintenance which is slightly higher than that but not massively because I\u2019m quite petite. back when I was cutting months ago, I started learning about calories (and then macros later on) and was shocked at how high calories are in certain foods. I\u2019d admit my relationship with food got quite tricky at some points during that time and because of that I was cooking at home (which allowed me to weigh and track everything) and I had not eaten out at all in months. I\u2019ve been working on getting better at that and have been going out to eat with friends a lot more (when compared to those months when I hadn\u2019t eaten out at all, now I do that roughly 1-2 times a week) and I\u2019ve been really enjoying it! when I first started eating out again I\u2019d only pick the lowest calorie options like a plain side salad when I probably would\u2019ve wanted the burger the most for example. and now I\u2019ve kind of worked out a way which will allow me to order more \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods or foods which I would\u2019ve never allowed myself to have whilst staying under my goals. ik people have mentioned eating less throughout the week to haven higher budget on weekends or before going out for a big meal etc so I guess in that sense my way of doing things is quite similar. however I track macros too, so what I do is for example, if I knew I had plans going to this restaurant with a friend during the weekend, I\u2019d log the option I want to go for along with its macros (eg a pizza that\u2019s 1300 calories) and then the week (or days) building up to that day, I\u2019d log a fraction of that pizza every day (eg 0.1 / 0.25 etc) so in some sense every day I\u2019m saving a bit and then I\u2019m able to have the full pizza when I go out and truly enjoy it rather than tell myself I can only have a bit of that / resort to ordering the lowest calorie side salad on the menu. \nI think this particularly works well when for example it\u2019s a drink / pastry / dessert I\u2019m really craving. the pizza will probably fill me up but often when I have a 400 calorie cake / pastry I probably would get hungry later in the day and this way, I get to enjoy the dessert but also don\u2019t have to make the 400 calorie cut all in one go. \n\nI personally don\u2019t enjoy eating out on my own haha so I guess it works out so that I\u2019d have this meal with my friends planned and I can look forward to and budget for that during the week. idk if anyone else does something similar - I\u2019ve tried this for a couple of weeks now and it seems to be working and that my relationship with food has improved a lot (?) I\u2019d love to hear any thoughts on how people fit eating out / still enjoying food while on some sort of diet. as mentioned, ik some people set lower calorie budgets throughout the week to allow a higher one over the weekend, but for those of you who do something similar, how long of a period would you aim for? I\u2019ve seen people do daily / weekly calorie / macros goals and budgets, but do some of you go even longer than that (eg spread calorie budget over 2 weeks)?\n\nthanks for reading all this I hope it makes sense!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1js55e7/does_anyone_else_do_this_too/", "created_utc": 1743864607.0, "score": 10, "author": "randompoopp", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/1js55e7/does_anyone_else_do_this_too/", "html_title": ""}

My other go to is buying the lean cuisine or healthy choice meals since its quick and they have nice variety for low calories/high protein, but those are quite expensive in my area (about $5-$6 a meal). This is just really inconvenient because I really love to cook, but its quite hard when all I have is a microwave. I move into an apartment in August which has a really great kitchen, so I can't wait to be able to use it lol.\n\nI can't even sneak in like an air fryer or something because my RA will *know*. She catches everything :(\n\nFor reference I am 19yo F, 5'3, and \\~170lbs. I usually sit near 155/160lbs, but I am wanting to really be closer to 130lbs. I am currently sticking to 1,200 \\~ 1,400 calories a day since I am not exercising at all. So far this range has been good for me but I am afraid once finals hits again I'm gonna be back to eating comfort foods and gain more weight :/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1jr0aby/weight_loss_in_college_dorm/", "created_utc": 1743730794.0, "score": 16, "author": "Ok_Measurement_5757", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/1200isplenty/comments/1jr0aby/weight_loss_in_college_dorm/", "html_title": ""}
