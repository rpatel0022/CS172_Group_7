I remember being scared to death, and had cold water running down on my on all sides which cause me to have a panic attack. I\u2019d never been that scared in my life.\nEver since then, every time I took a shower I would get horrible panic attacks. I\u2019d imagine myself stuck in a tiny tube, water gushing all around me, and no way for me to escape. I\u2019d have to shower with the curtain open and someone in the room next to me. I could never be directly in the water for more than a few seconds at a time.\nWell I discovered this sub, and never really tried eating oranges in the shower. I browsed the sub and thought it was funny but that was it. Well, after hearing everyone\u2019s testimonies I finally decided to give it a try.\nI was finally able to stay in the shower for more than a few seconds at a time, and I was able to partially close the curtain. I remembered on all of the comments saying just to relax and enjoy, and that\u2019s exactly what I did.\nI\u2019ve done it a few times and I can happily say I took my first shower with the curtain completely closed in over a year. It\u2019s was stupidly emotional.\nThank you all. Thank you thank you thank you. I wish I could hug you all. This has been one of the hardest obstacles in my life and now I\u2019m almost over it.

PROLONGED EYE CONTACT.", "Ah yes, I love to eat the orange peel too!", "Wow. Assuming this is a physical piece and not digital. (And I'm pretty sure this is physical). The use of a paper with a lot of tooth and paper fiber to give a natural looking texture to the skin is great. And then going on to make that stand out by creating contrast to the surrounding colors\u2014that's smart af.\n\nGreat piece. Great line work. Great coloring. If I had to make a comparison both the vibrancy of your color choices and elegance of your line work remind me of work done by Mike and Laura Allred.\n\nThe following only applies if you ***dont*** want it to look how I describe. I feel like your line work can still take on a lot of character if you want that in it. At the moment it's almost too clean and too smooth and feels somewhat like vectored lines. HOWEVER these kind of lines are ***heavily*** complimented by the technique/effect I described being done by the paper qualities.\n\nBy this I mean, these things done in tandem create a tasteful balance of your elements at play without making one stronger and another weaker. Maybe that's what makes it so *pleasurable* to look at.\n\nI know I'm a nobody but I love it  This is a legit 9/10 for me to look at. I definitely want to see more of your work as you certainly display some genuine talent AND skill for the work. Keep it up!!! As someone who is in a creative writing drought, I know how difficult it can be at times to maintain morale in your craft up.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention everything is tied together beautifully by the inclusion of those sweat drops and the motion lines. I think motion lines are a lot harder to do *well* than people believe they are. You really did them in a way that feels *natural*\u2014as though all those lines were *actually* motion emanating from the same direction.\n\nEdit 2: if any of my observations rang true to you I want you to know it's *only* because of how high of quality your scan/picture was.

However because of the detail of the scan I was able to notice the nuance of your work.\n\nEdit 3: I do have one other critique regarding the effect of the perspective on the shoulder lines, I won't get into it because I feel it may be too obtuse to describe.

{"title": "A First-Timer's Critical Analysis of Eating an Orange in the Shower.", "selftext": "I stumbled upon this subreddit earlier today from a r/AITA post, and I was intrigued by the idea.  When I learned that there was only one fresh orange in the house that no one wanted, I decided to try it.  Having just finished my first shower-orange, here are my thoughts on the experience:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Walking into the shower with an orange in your hand feels very strange.  I don't think I've ever walked into the shower with something in hand before.  I like different and weird experiences like that.\n\n2. The mess cleans itself up.\n\n3. Tearing the orange apart with your bare hands feels primal and satisfying.\n\n4. The smell and taste of the orange reminds me of eating orange slices as a kid after soccer practice.  That may have been the last time I ate a raw orange.  Nice hit of nostalgia.\n\n5. The shower smells of citrus for the remainder of the shower.\n\n6. It's an excuse to spend more time in the shower.  Who doesn't like chilling in the shower?\n\n7. Good dose of vitamin C.\n\nCons:\n\n1. What do you do with the bits of peel?  Gathering them up and throwing them out in the bathroom trash was a bit of a pain.  If I did this everyday, I would need a better system.\n\n2. Some bits of orange are going down the drain.  Again, if I did it everyday, I would worry about the bits of orange building up in the drain/pipes.\n\n3. The orange juice coats your hands and does not come off as easily as I would like.  I accidentally wiped some orange juice across my face during the shower, which wasn't pleasant.\n\nThe orange itself tasted like an orange.  I don't think the shower does anything to enhance the flavor, but I also don't think it's supposed to.  It definitely enhances the experience though.  Overall I'd say it was a good-to-great experience, 8/10.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/d59ryi/a_firsttimers_critical_analysis_of_eating_an/", "created_utc": 1568682500.0, "score": 674, "author": "PrimePain", "num_comments": 64, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/d59ryi/a_firsttimers_critical_analysis_of_eating_an/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Next time chill the orange in the fridge and tear into it when it's all hot and steamy.

I think that this is really wholesome of you to ask and while you can\u2019t enjoy citrus fruits, maybe there\u2019s something you can substitute it with! \n\nFirst, I think the orange is such a wonderfully fragrant fruit. I think a big part of the draw to the orange is it\u2019s strong smell. When you\u2019re in a steamy shower your nose gets A LOT  better. It\u2019s why good things always smell extra good and why things like farts always smell worse. Oranges smell AMAZING and it\u2019s why they\u2019re so many smelly things with citrus (i.e. essential oils, candles, lotions, etc.) \n\nSecond, I feel like the next big part is the sensation. Oranges are refreshing af. It\u2019s like a watermelon, but  100xs flavor blasted. They\u2019re juicy and cool and have such a bright flavor. When you have an orange in a steamy shower it\u2019s almost like drinking a glass of ice water. It\u2019s cool, refreshing, and borderline exhilarating. \n\nLastly, i think it\u2019s the mindfulness that goes into eating an orange. You have to peel it and some people like to try to peel it all in one go so they focus on that. Then there\u2019s how you want to eat it. You can do whatever you want,  but I think eating it one segment at a time is the best. It was almost like a breathing exercise in where I was completely able to clear my mind and just really enjoy being in the moment. For me, it was a HUGE breath of fresh air and really cleared my mind.\n\nI think you could have this experience too! Maybe just trial and error with some different foods! I think cold grapes, mango spears, or some sort of melon would be really good, but I think any fragrant refreshing food/ drink you enjoy  could work!", "I don\u2019t want to cause a disturbance in the citrus love here, but you can get a similar carnal satisfaction out of other juicy fruits like grapefruit or watermelon.\n\nJust dive the fuck in, no rules, no concept of messy as water runs over your body. Just you, and the fruit becoming one, in a raw, unrestrained wild dance.", "I would like to bring forth the motion that in cases of rare and unfortunate citrus allergies, one be allowed to enjoy cold and refreshing watermelon. \n\nAll that agree say Aye!", "I also have a citrus allergy but I\u2019ve attempted this once. I personally found it to be an interesting experience but not something I was compelled to do again. It smells nice and is an over all enjoyable experience if you like the taste and smell of (in my case) oranges", "Try Peaches if you can't have citrus! No worries about the juice running down your chin!", "A perfect orange will be tender to the gentle squeeze of your fingertips. A faint aroma of citrus may be appreciated at this time. To pierce the skin, a tool may be used or one can choose to dig their index finger into the pulp until it gives way. Either way, a fine mist of citrus is sure to be exuded from a just ripe orange. The retracted index finger will be embossed in a thin layer of off white pulp, and the white of the nail will certainly be full of difficult to remove pulp. Continue peeling in this manner in sheets, bits, or in continuum until all the flesh is removed. The flesh should effortlessly give way to the light, airy varicose under workings of pulp that encase the fruit. One may choose to tediously peel this away or not. Grabbing at the apex of the fruit, between two sections, one can begin to divide the fruit in half. This may result in tearing of the pulp resulting in juice being exposed. At this point, one has the opportunity to further remove the fine layer of remaining pulp. Grasping the edge of the varicose pulp on the border of the divided half provides more leverage for removing stubborn bits. At this time, the may be a combination of fine pulp under the nails and on the skin, juice, and a strong essence of citrus in the air. \nAt this time, separate a single segment or two-three together and enjoy. Do not bite into and orange like an apple. That is barbaric. \nAs the tiny capsules of juice filled pulp burst between your teeth, explosions of citrus fill the cavity of your mouth. A ripe fruit eaten vigorously may result in the escape of juice sprays from your lips, across the room onto your friend or cat. This is when one can be certain they have a perfect fruit to consume. Chew until there is no more juice pouring down your throat, swallow and repeat! Wash your hands when finished. Every. Time. \n-end", "Mango! It\u2019s juicy and orange in color", "Vodka is a great substitute for anything!", "It is visceral and revitalizing to engorge the juicy flesh of a delicious fruit first thing in the morning.

Same goes with other fruits.", "Be me, shower with oranges, enjoy the sweet tangy smell of fresh citrus, stick one under my balls, literally taste the sweetness \n\nBe you: not showering with oranges, why live?", "Grapes or apple!", "I\u2019d recommend trying with a nectarine or melon instead.

Strawberries?", "I've been allergic to oranges for only the most recent third of my life, but I hadn't discovered shower oranges yet!

Below is a little synopsis of what I did/experienced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInitially, my shower was nothing of note.  I found myself simply going through the motions of washing my filthy body albeit with a fruit tucked safely in the corner shelf, patiently waiting.  As the dirt and grime sloughed off my broad shoulders and chiseled abs I came to a realization.  I wasn't simply *washing* my body, I was *preparing* it for what came next.\n\nI took a step through the water pummeling every inch of me.  My body was ready - purified - and I reached for the orange.  Piercing the rind, microparticles of citric acid burst forth and mixed with the hot water vapor, filling the bathroom with a slight but noticeable citrus scent.  I peel the rest of the orange tenderly but with determination.  *Finally!* The orange is ready for consumption.\n\nThe orange and I are both naked - physically and spiritually - as I begin to split it into halves.  Doing this I can feel the anticipation building, like with the first kiss between lovers or a child on Christmas morning. I take one carpel and place it in my mouth. *Delicious...* The flavor, texture, and odor all come together perfectly as I continue eating and contemplating my place in this universe. Was it a transcendental experience? That's for you to decide, dear reader.\n\nI finish the first half piece by piece and continue on to the second. Past the formality of ceremony I bring the half to my mouth and *bite.*  The juice flows onto my hands and down my chin, to be washed away in moments...but those moments were treasured nonetheless.  I finish the orange and emerge from the fog and heat as a renewed man.  The best part? When I leave to gather clothes to change into I return to the bathroom and am met with orange scent.  A soft wave goodbye from the orange that altered my showering experience henceforth.\n\nOverall 8/10 experience but next time I'm going *BIGGER AND JUICIER.*", "Welcome to the club!

I ate the orange and I've got to say, putting it in the fridge was a fantastic idea. Delicious and refreshing.\nIt wasn't exactly a life-changing experience but it definitely was pleasant.

Orange Lady was always put down the hall and to the right, yet she\u2019d always find her way toward us.  Every single time her silhouette would wind up ensconced in our doorframe, only her backside and always with an unpeeled orange in her left hand.  Or, if you were putting out towels or stocking tea, bam!  White bum, orange fruit a few feet away.  Several times I was wiping down a shower stall, zesty scent of citrus in the air, only to find peels wrapped politely in the vanity bins later.  I never knew how deep this ran until now. I didn\u2019t know the pure intentionally of citrus consumption enwrapped in the steamy, rainfall shower of a fancy-pants spa or the sweet comforts of home. Rest easy, folks, I know what her ass looks like better than mine.  \n\nShe had a writhing tattoo of green ivy along her torso that twisted as she swayed her bright, full moon behind in the dimly lit repose of our spa. Forgive me, I couldn\u2019t attempt that detail in this painting.  It was my first and only one, and I was so frustrated failing to capture her.

I\u2019m currently sitting in a towel and shampoo hair trying to write this all down. It was...\n\nLife.\n\nChanging.\n\nThe shower orange was something like never before. The juxtaposition of cold citrus to steamy water. The primitive bite into the orange, juice running down. No sticky mess. No clean up. (Other than the peel, of course.) The first bite into the orange, accompanied by the steamy shower, brings back something within. Like out ancestors. Bathing in water and eating fruit and just living it up. There\u2019s something so simple yet wonderful about the mundane act of a shower spiced by a plain and simple orange. 10/10. Quite appealing.\n\n(Shower notes for future reference and maximum enjoyment): \n\nREFRIGERATE the oranges! Cold = best. \n\nHot shower. Steamy. \n\nLastly. The mindset. I saw some posts previous to my endeavor saying that \u201cthis is crap, a bunch of horse shit, blah blah just an orange in a shower.\u201d \n\nIt is what you make of it. Embrace the orange.

{"title": "My Recipe to Success: A Suggestion for Newcomers", "selftext": "Hello everyone! Anyone else always get the urge to make a post on here after they've had a shower orange? I sure do, and this one is for anyone who:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Tried shower orange, but didnt get much from it \n\n2) Hasnt tried it and is looking for pointers\n\n3) Is simply looking for new ways to step up their shower oranging game\n\nand anyone else who might find this post helpful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, this recipe includes lots of optional components, and you can obviously mix and match however you want. Let it be noted that the full experience includes, of course, everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMandatory ingredients: \n\n\\>Orange (or any other citrus fruit, though I do not recommend lemons for beginners)\n\n\\>Shower (or bath)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOptional (but highly recommended) ingredients:\n\n\\>Fridge \n\n\\>Waterproof bluetooth headphones + your favourite music \n\n\\>Dark bathroom\n\n\\>The ability to put yourself into the mind of a predator mercilessly ripping into its prey\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how I do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter completing my grocery haul, I give my orange a good wash before putting it in the fridge overnight. If you take anything from this post, let it be the chillage of your citrus. Im 100% serious when I say that this can make or break the experience. \n\nI usually shower in the evenings, but just do it whenever it feels right. Maybe you open your fridge and see the fruit calling out to you in the morning, and if you have the time, do not feel bad about giving in to the call. However, this will make it a little harder to truly darken your bathroom. \n\nI dont have any windows in mine, so the process is very easy for me. I close the door and shove some old clothes in the bottom gap. Yes, I shower in complete darkness. It is exhilerating. Be careful, it might take you some time to get truly familiar with the layout of your bathroom in the dark. Make use of your hands, smashing your nose into a wall may dampen the experience. \n\nI already have my headphones on at this point. I have a playlist specifically constructed for showering, but sometimes I just let all my saved songs play on shuffle. Any unwanted songs are simply skipped, and the immersion doesnt get ruined, even if you dont catch an out-of-place tune immediately. And even so, getting back into the zone is something that happens completely on its own. \n\nLets recap. I am standing in complete and utter darkness, music is playing, the orange is either being held by me or resting inside the shower. Dont worry, it wont warm up that quickly. Take your time. Have I mentioned that this process will make your showering a lot more time consuming and water-wasting? Yeah... maybe keep an eye on your water bill. \n\nThe prep is done. It is time. Get in the shower. Now, I know some people like their cold showers, you do you, but I \\*highly\\* recommend choosing hot water here. Trust me. This isnt a \"get clean quickly before work\" kind of thing, its an experience. \n\nI often sit down because its even more relaxing, but standing can also help to get you into the predator mindset. Yeah, I wasnt joking, for me this part is just as important as fridging the fruit.\n\nWhen you step into that shower, thats your cue to unleash yourself. You are an animal! This is your chance to act like one! Screw any tools, you only need your teeth and hands here. Take a big bite, spit it out, take another one. Rip the thing apart with your teeth and hands, bury your face in the flesh, scarf it down like its the last thing you'll ever eat! Take the pieces into both hands and take alternating bites. No one can see you! You are free! Completely and utterly let yourself go. The more juice you get on yourself, the better. Fuck it, rub the thing over your body like its a goddamn exfoliator, and then continue eating, because whos gonna stop you? God? The government? The orange is Pompeii, and you, my friend, are Vesuvio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe carnage will end at one point. You will be covered in sweet nectar, bits of orange in your teeth, theres pieces of peel on the ground. Let the hot water wash over you, let it carry your sins down the drain. Theres music playing. You might have forgotten about it during your feast. Now, its your tether. You can start cleaning yourself up now, or remain in this in-between state just a little bit longer. You deserve it. \n\nHow you finish your shower is up to you. Turning the water off is always hard, but of course necessary. I like to clean the peel up as soon as Im done and dressed, otherwise it can get stuck on the floor, but if youre willing to risk it for the sweet orange smell, youre welcome to leave it. (Careful, the smell can turn sour relatively quickly.)\n\nFor me, shower oranging is not something I do every time. I want to keep it a little bit special, for bad days, or just for days where Im really in the mood for a good citrus treatment. Its also, as you may have noticed, pretty time- and water-consuming. Dont feel bad about it though! You deserve nice things, one long shower every on\u00b4ce in a while will kill neither you, nor the planet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhoever may be reading this: I hope you enjoyed this post. Whether you decide to try out my advice, or simply appreciate my writing, Im glad you stuck around 'til the end. \n\nCheers, and happy showering!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "created_utc": 1649098898.0, "score": 189, "author": "None", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I've been eating Oranges / citrus in showers EVERYDAY since i discovered this sub..

Is there no regard for the singularity of this experience, even on it's own subreddit?! Hell, why not show me a picture of your shower panini? Maybe snap a steamy toke off the ol' crack pipe? WHERE ARE THE GODDAMNED STANDARDS?!\n\n>6. This subreddit is about the purity and carnal act of devouring an orange(or many) in the shower. This is a place of zealotry, for crusades against forbidden fruit. It is a sanctuary, and haven for all souls who wander--though are not lost. We want everyone to feel at peace here.\n\nI believe I have identified the truly forbidden fruit, and her name is the name of the harlot: Shower Beer. Who among you can truly call yourselves a shower orange purist, let alone a zealot, if you tolerate a thing of such uniquely unspoiled beauty to be marred by alcoholic abandon?

{"title": "Went for the bottle. Took the orange instead.", "selftext": "Disclaimer: While writing this, I realised it had turned into a sort of dump for my thoughts, only tied into the art of shower oranging at the very end. It starts out dark, and it stays dark for a while. Dont read if you're triggered by mentions of alcoholism or other mental illnesses. Im sorry. \n\n(This is a throwaway for a reason. If you recognize my writing style, don't mention it. Please.) \n--------- \n\nRough. Rough days, nay, weeks and months. Endless cycle, at least as far as I can see. Can I break it? It would mean breaking myself. Shatter my inner form into millions of pieces, pick out whats salvagable, leave behind whats tainted. Be left with a pile of shards too sharp to touch and reassemble. Wait til a gloved hand comes along to gently put me back together. But how long? How long to sit and wait, the Whole of Me in splinters? Too long. \n\nIts a slow process, recovery. Especially with no help. Especially when you dont even know what you're recovering from, exactly. Vague pictures of friends turned enemies. An inexplicable terror when confronted with loud, sudden noises. A self esteem so low and deep that the Mariana Trench grows jealous. \n\nNot every day is this bad, thank fuck. I would've been dead a long time ago. I have friends again, and I enjoy every second I spend with them. I have, somehow, made it into university (though this is now a huge part of my struggles as well. Uni work is hard, and harder when you dont have the strength to stay sober). \nToday, I saw the rain, and I went outside to walk in it for the better part of two hours. I saw a snail, and I watched it glide along the wet leafs. It was beautiful, a perfect escape. \n\nOpening the door to my apartment shut it all down. Confronted with piles and piles of paper, work to be done, no rest in sight, at least not without taking shortcuts. It crushes you. After a while, waking up to a new day is dreadful. More work. No sleep. And oh, the guilt. The GUILT that smothers you for not doing what is expected. I barely keep up with my classes, but even thats a lie. I dont. I dont. I do the bare minimum for no one to catch on. I spend my days in a numb stasis. Unable to complete the work, the work that keeps piling and piling, no end in sight, courses followed by exams followed by the next semester, no end, no end. \n\nCould you bear it? Are you struggling, too? Are we alone, together?\u00a0 \nI never knew how people became alcoholics. Everyone knows about the dangers. You try it maybe once or twice. Day-drinking, I mean. Hopefully with friends. If you're not there yet, then don't even think about starting. Never, I repeat, Never take to the bottle when you're alone. You won't realise it's a habit until it's too late. \nI could still stop. I think. \nIt's not every day. It's not that much. But oh, how enchanting it is, opening the fridge and seeing the bottle, thinking: 'One sip won't hurt', until it turns into two and three and four and- \n\nComing home today was rough. I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't so cold from the rain that had long since penetrated my clothes and gotten to my skin. I hadn't taken a jacket with me. \nA perfect time, a perfect situation for a shower. \nAnd as with every shower these days, I went for the fridge, and reached for the bottle. Not open yet. I had emptied the last one a day earlier. \nI was about to close the door and resume with my harmful routine, when something caught my eye. \nAn orange. A singular, ripe orange I had picked up from the store earlier this week. I stared. I fought with myself. I picked it up, and put the bottle away. For another day. \n\nIt's been a while since my last time. Two months, maybe? I got caught up in... everything. The thought only crossed my mind occasionally, but I was always too tired to endulge in it. Walk past the fruit stand, grab my weekly groceries and leave. No thoughts spared on some citrussy endeavour. \n\nGetting into the shower was... almost ceremonial. I sat down. I always sit. Standing takes too much energy. I sat, letting the hot water almost burn my skin, until I forgot the world around me, and myself too. This time, I was cradling a citrus fruit, for the first time in a long time. My fingers were digging into the skin. I wanted to rip and tear. I wanted to destroy. But I was too tired. \nI opened the peel slowly. With care and precision, instead of hunger and beast-like urgency. \nEvery bite was enjoyed slowly. The drops of cold juice presented a stark contrast to the steaming water, but I got used to them hitting my stomach in semi regular intervals. \nI had my eyes closed. It was peaceful. \nIn the end, I cradled the empty peel. It would have been a good moment to cry, had it been a movie. But I just sat in silence. \nTurned off the water, disposed of the waste. Sat down and wrote this post. \n\nIt's been over an hour.\nI still want to drink. Every time I look to my left, I see the open book that I abandoned hours ago, waiting for me to come back. Keep studying. It's not even hard. I just can't bring myself to do it. It's always been this way. Doing things, no matter what, is the most difficult hurdle in my life. \n\nBut there's one thing I can do. Start buying more oranges, and start endulging in the beauty of it all again. Every sip traded for a bite is a good thing. Every shower I can finish without going for the bottle is a win. \n\n- \n\nI've written multiple shower oranging manifestos. Some public, some only for myself. This one will be posted, albeit with no ties to my main account. I need to share my thoughts with someone, and I believe that this community will not judge me. And maybe, just maybe, one person who reads this will be able to relate, and feel a little less alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "created_utc": 1654706446.0, "score": 172, "author": "ThrThrThrorange", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Well this was a wild ride but I have explained to multiple people before that this subreddit and subculture is about more than a bunch of silly fruit eaters.

As I approached the shower I had quite the confusion, as holding an orange while entering a shower is not a task that I have ever done. \n\nWhile in the shower, I was soon to realize that I needed to peel the orange with my wet hands. Primal instincts kicked in and there I was, tearing the orange out of the rind with my sopping hands. The sweet smell of oranges filled the shower, and I allowed the pieces of the skin fall to the shower floor. I proceeded to eat the orange and I enjoyed the light snack, before I proceeded to wash the rest of myself. By the end of the shower, the bathroom smelled like oranges and I felt clean. \n\nI will say that having a shower orange is a pleasant experience, but I cannot find myself buying multiple oranges to enjoy each time I shower.

{"title": "The Cult Doctrine", "selftext": "I feel very strongly that this comment by @HugeHouseplant must be its own individual post. It deserves so many more upvotes. \n\nThe Ritual of the Shower Orange\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nBegin by preparing your shower space. Remove any distractions, ensuring the environment is calm and quiet. Allow the natural light, if any, to create a soft, diffused glow. Adjust the water to a hot, steamy temperature that envelops you like an ancient, welcoming embrace.\n\nPreparation\n\n1. \u2060Select the Orange: Choose a ripe, juicy orange. Feel its weight and texture, and appreciate the vibrant color that promises a burst of citrus delight.\n2. \u2060Prepare Yourself: Disrobe completely and step into the shower. Let the hot water flow over you, relaxing your muscles and clearing your mind. Take deep breaths, inhaling the steam and anticipating the forthcoming ritual.\n\nThe Ritual\n\n1. \u2060Initial Caress: Hold the orange in your hand, feeling its coolness against your hot, wet skin. Take a moment to connect with the fruit, appreciating its journey from a distant grove to your shower.\n2. \u2060Ripping the Peel: With deliberate, forceful movements, begin to rip the peel from the orange. Let the water cascade over your hands, washing away the peel and releasing the orange\u2019s fragrant oils. As you tear off each piece of the peel, throw it onto the shower floor. Watch as the pieces scatter, creating an almost mystical scene, their essence mingling with the steam to fill the air with a powerful, invigorating citrus aroma.\n3. Dividing the Segments: Gently separate the orange into individual segments. Feel the plump, juicy flesh beneath your fingers. Take a moment to admire the segments, appreciating their perfect, natural symmetry.\n4. The First Bite: Raise a segment to your lips and bite into it with gusto. Let the juice explode in your mouth, savoring the sweet, tangy flavor. Allow the excess juice to trickle down your chin, neck, and chest, mingling with the hot water. Feel the primal pleasure of eating with your hands, like an animal, connected to the raw, unfiltered experience of nourishing yourself.\n5. Continued Indulgence: Continue to eat the orange, segment by segment. With each bite, embrace the messiness, feeling the juice run freely down your body. Close your eyes and lose yourself in the sensory overload\u2014the taste, the texture, the sound of the shower, the heat of the water, and the feel of the juice on your skin.\n6. Embrace the Moment: As you finish the orange, take a moment to relish the culmination of the ritual. Feel the satisfaction of the fruit in your stomach, the lingering taste on your lips, and the refreshing cleanliness from the shower. Allow yourself to feel both primal and cleansed, connected to a simple yet profound act of nourishment and indulgence.\n\nCompletion\n\n1. Rinse and Reflect: Rinse off any remaining juice, feeling the hot water cleanse you. Reflect on the experience, how it made you feel, and the simple joy it brought.\n2. Clean Up: Carefully collect the orange peels from the shower floor and dispose of them properly. Exit the shower, feeling refreshed, invigorated, and deeply satisfied.\n\nPost-Ritual\n\nWrap yourself in a soft towel. Reflect on the joy of allowing yourself to experience something so elemental and satisfying, and carry that sense of indulgence and connection with you throughout your day. Feel the eldritch essence of the ritual, a timeless connection to the primal joy of nature\u2019s bounty.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/s/kuQYUq3Xp6", "created_utc": 1723000819.0, "score": 15, "author": "callmecrazyyy", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/1em1ip2/the_cult_doctrine/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I approve"]}

{"title": "The ShowerOrange CULPRIT!!", "selftext": "My mom was getting frustrated because she kept finding orange shavings in the shower drain. At this time, my sister's boyfriend started staying with us, so she assumed it was him that was weirdly eating oranges in the shower. So, my mom goes to my sister and says \"hey, please tell your boyfriend to keep food out of the shower because it clogs up the drain\". Cut to my (at times hostile) sister being really weirded out and annoyed that my mother would assume something so bizarre of him. My mother kept asking my sister to tell him to stop for about a week and my sister would always just shrug her off because, well, why the hell would her boyfriend be eating oranges in the shower? After enough of this, my sister finally goes to her boyfriend and asks if he's doing it. He says no. Confusion strikes. How the hell are orange shavings getting in the drain? Cue my entire family being questioned about this (up until this point I had no idea this was going on because I guess nobody expected me to be the culprit) and the \"shower orange\" debate started up in my family. At one point we all sat down for breakfast and my sister mentions it passive aggressively because she was getting annoyed. After hearing her mention it, I go \"oh yeah it's a thing online, I've been doing it lately\". Without my anticipation, my entire family finds themselves in uproar. \"IT'S YOU. YOU'RE THE SHOWER ORANGE EATER. YOU'RE THE ONE CLOGGING UP THE DRAIN. WHY THE HELL ARE YOU EATING ORANGES IN THE SHOWER.\" I was shocked. I had no idea this was an issue. I explain to them the concept of aromatherapy (it was a bullshit explanation but I needed to say something) with the astonished looks on all their faces.

{"title": "Icarian Relief", "selftext": "A few days ago, one of my friends told me that I \"simply had to try eating an orange in the shower.\" If this friend is to be believed, the experience approaches the divine; a conquest of pure sensory freedom. Thinking I had no reason to doubt this friend and eager for new experiences, I decided I must try.\n\n  \nSo today, I took myself over to the grocery store where I carefully and thoughtfully perused the citrus section. This was to be a formative moment, a memory for the grandchildren. It was essential I selected my tools well. I determined that clementines were too ordinary for the job. Yet I found that the thought of blood-orange was too dramatic. The Mandarins were too small, and the cara cara oranges felt too self important with their prominent display. For a moment I thought all was lost. I simply could not attempt such a feat ill equipped. Then I saw it. The most perfectly plump, juicely ripe morsel. It was obvious really. After all, I too would have mine exposed. \n\n  \nA navel orange was the only choice. \n\n  \nUpon arriving home I announced my intention to the husband who begrudgingly agreed to observe the ritual. I gathered the necessary supplies with eager anticipation: the orange, a shower chair, and a bowl for the peels of course, and stepped into the bathroom. I ran the water as hot as it would go and waited for the room to steam up.\n\n  \nFriends. Dear ones. I cannot lie. I peeled that orange with abandon. The juices evaporated into the steam of the shower adding a layer of fragrance that drove me to bliss, and then beyond. I became feral. I pounced upon my meal with the gusto of a cheetah to a gazelle, like a vulture to carrion, like some guy in a fedora to an IPA. I knew at once the taste of ichyr. I stared God in the face and knew he had made me, an animal, for this experience. It was a feast of transcendence.\n\n  \nAs I'm sure you've realized by now, this story is not a happy one. It was obvious, really, from the start. But I ask you  friends, should I really  have known better? Would you have? Could have evaded such tantalizing temptation? Or would you have known that simple truth: every story of triumph is merely the opening act of a tragedy? It was hubris of the worst kind. \n\n  \nAt one point, mid citric mastication, my hand slipped. The precious orange began to fall. I grabbed. And dear ones, I am ashamed to admit it...\n\n  \nI squeezed.\n\n  \nThere was a horrid second of a realization as I felt the meat resist and give way. It was followed by an even shorter instant of hope that physics and chance might conspire to my benefit this time. It was not to be. The juice shot directly into my eyes. \n\n  \nI've often heard it debated, those last thoughts of Icarus as he plummeted towards the sea, facing certain death. Was he consumed by fear? Was he regretful? Was he ecstatic? \n\n  \nFriends, as someone who has recently flown too close to the sun, I venture it was none of these. No, I know what Icarus felt in those last seconds just before he faced oblivion. It wasn't fear. It wasn't ecstasy. It was relief, relief in the knowledge that though he would live no more, he was freed from the burden of waking tomorrow knowing it was possible to fly. \n\n  \nIcarus was the lucky one.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/19e87rk/icarian_relief/", "created_utc": 1706069268.0, "score": 140, "author": "Abject-Ratio2346", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/19e87rk/icarian_relief/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["My GOD.", "The profundity of this exquisite prose will stay with me forever.

I think maybe the 2 ladies in this story might be here, because, while long, this story ends exactly where it should be for this sub. \n\nSo, it's 1993. I'm in a fraternity in college that's composed of 75% jocks and 25% Dead Heads. I don't know why, but I gravitated to these guys because they just always seemed to be having a good time. \n\nAt the end of the winter semester they started planning on following the Dead around for the summer. Back then you mail in an envelope with a list of all the shows you wanted to see with your money (cash) and they would send you tickets for what was available when they processed your envelope, along with a cash return for the stuff you didn't get.\n\nLong story short, all of them got tickets for a 2 night show at Soldier Field in Chicago...in August. One of the guys hooked up with a hippy chick on tour early in the summer tour and said he just wanted to spend time with this girl traveling to State and National Parks for the rest of the summer. \n\nSomehow they swung back into my college town because it was on the way. They offered me the ticket, but I said \"no way bro!\". \n\nThey took that as a yes and promptly kidnapped me in the middle of the night with duct tape and rope. \n\nAnyway we show up there and it is sweltering hot. Concrete and asphalt everywhere, just radiating heat. \n\nThat was when we took the acid. \n\nDumbass me, thought everyone would sit in their assigned seats in the nosebleeds, but it ended up only being me and another guy they had kidnapped who had never been to a show.\n\nSuffice it to say we were not prepared. The first set was mind blowing for me. When set break started, both of us looked at each other and the guy goes I NEED water! I too was dry.\n\nThis next part, I swear to God I'm not making up...and yes...I used to have have pictures so I know I wasn't hallucinating. \n\nThese 2 girls in front of us turned around. They were not wearing tops...at all.\n\nOne of them says \"You guys are new to this aren't you?\" We literally just stared with our jaws on the floor, both of us wondering if this was part of the trip. \n\nThe other one says something like \"you guys wouldn't be good boy scouts. You're not prepared for something like this.\" And then they hold up 2 1 gallon jugs of water that had been frozen at one point and had just thawed enough to drink.\n\nEVERYTHING WAS GLORIOUS AT THIS POINT! \n\nAgain...they had no cooler, they pulled this stuff from out under their chair and just handed each of us a gallon jug. Then they each pulled one out for themselves. It was thinking they had a refrigerated bag of holding.\n\nWe were like fiends and started quaffing as much as we could get with  water running down our chests.\n\nBy this point the girls were laughing at us and one goes...\"are you ready? Now we're REALLY going to blow your minds!\" They then produced a bunch of gallon zip lock bags FILLED with ice cold orange sections, all peeled and quartered. At first neither of use got it until we each tasted one, the juice running down our chins...the explosion of taste was orgasmic.\n\nWhen we finally were somewhat satiated we came back to reality and started talking to them. We made small talk and one of them goes \"Oh! You guys are tripping right?\" And we confirmed that we were. Then she turns to the other one and giddily says \"Let's show 'em the shower trick!\"\n\nI mean we were both 21..these were very hot ladies, topless, and they wanted to show us the \"shower trick\"? We were game.\n\nSo they take us down to the main boardwalk area, giggling the whole time. They show this place where they literally have cold water shower heads lined up in rows to cool people down.\n\nThey positioned each of us under a shower head, told us to close our eyes, lean our heads back, put our arms out like Jesus to the sides, and tell them what we saw.\n\nImmediately the water made everything so much better, but when the shower drops hit our eyelids, it was like fireworks going of in front of me. Brilliant explosions of color with every drop on our eyelids!   The dude next to me goes \"I CAN SEE EVERYTHING!\"...and I agreed with him!\n\nAt this point one of the girls whispers in my ear: \"now open your mouth\". In for for a penny in for a pound. I did and she started feeding me those ice cold orange quarters. \n\nMan...to this day I have never had a multi-sense experience that I had at that minute.\n\nThe heat was radiating from around us but I felt like I had the shroud of coolness on in the shower. The explosions of color along with the added taste of those cold oranges was incredible.", "These replies are not exactly clearing the OPs question.... still confused.", "If you\u2019re looking for kinky citrus stuff, you\u2019re probably in the wrong place.

{"title": "My story; First time eating an orange in the shower: 15/10 would recommend.", "selftext": "I looked at this sub, questioning why it existed. I laughed at everybody eating oranges in the shower, and mocked their very presence in this world. For months, I kept r/ShowerOrange in the back of my mind. For months, I rolled my eyes at these beautiful redditors.\n\nThen one day, I turned on the water to take a shower and felt the steam rise up my back. It surrounded me as I opened the curtain to test the water, but my hand quickly flinched back due to the heat. And something was missing. I didn\u2019t get my usual sense of comfort with the hot showers I took every night.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered something. Was it just a coincidence? Magic? A sign? Or was it just simply fate? Because I remembered I had an orange sitting in the back of my fridge. I left the bathroom, on a personal mission to see if it was still there. And I saw it. A beautiful, juicy, deeply perfect orange on the bottom shelf.\n\nSo I picked it up and took it into the bathroom. I was taken aback by my own decision. I couldn\u2019t believe I was really going to do it. I left it on the counter, second guessing myself. Thinking I was crazy. I hopped in the shower, missing something again. I stared at the luscious orange skin, calling me like temptation I\u2019d never experienced before. \n\nBefore I could stop myself or even realize what I had done, I was tearing into the orange with my teeth. I ripped it apart like a savage, untamable beast. The juice dripped down my chin like the blood from my fresh kill, which was swiftly washed away by the current of the shower. The peels fell to my orange-soaked feet, carelessly discarded with to get to the beautiful juice within. The fresh citrusy smell erupted into the air as I stared at what I had done. Both me and the orange. Naked. Vulnerable. Exposed. The way god intended it.\n\nIt was erotic. So erotic, I had to stop myself from reaching down to touch what had been stimulated my this experience. Because eating an orange in the shower isn\u2019t just something you do. It\u2019s an experience.

{"title": "Discovering the Darkness Inside of Me", "selftext": "Last week I had the shower orange urge for the first time and I couldn\u2019t let go. The idea of someone taking an orange into the shower as a daily ritual shook something within me. Initially I was amused by the idea, but over the course of a few days and showers it grew into something more. Every shower I took I imagined how it would feel in the moment\u2026 what it would be like to be holding an orange\u2026 so smooth and soft and plump\u2026 warm soapy water dripping down my hair and back\u2026 how I\u2019d be so very fortunate to have this big ass.. . fucking massive, sweet, sticky, oozing, genetically modified orange in my hands. \n\nA primal urge began to awaken inside me. The last shower I took I was completely helpless to it, I took that innocent orange into the shower and cranked the water to the hottest it could possibly go. The bathroom slowly began to fill with steam completely and my skin was burning very badly\u2026.

Also to set it in because if it touched any shower stuff I wouldn\u2019t eat it. It was fresh out of the fridge, which was great for eating but bad for peeling. Made my fingertips hurt - I\u2019d forgotten how much of a pain in the ass peeling oranges can be. I also did it before actually getting in, which probably wasn\u2019t following protocol. Whatever. I don\u2019t have enough hot water for that.\n\nGot in. Started eating orange by just biting right in, which seemed like the right technique. Shower smelled great instantly. I forgot that eating it like that would hurt though (I have a lip piercing that pinches when I eat stuff like apples and large burgers) so I switched to wedges halfway through. Bummer. Not worrying about the mess was real nice, and there was something cathartic about the cold juice running down my neck and arms in the hot water, but i was still annoyed by all the pith. Fuck pith.\n\nI will say, while eating my orange, I didn\u2019t curl my toes. I didn\u2019t for the rest of my shower either. So it sort of worked. Overall it was kind of meh though, because I forgot a really important detail.\n\nI don\u2019t even like oranges.\n\n**Lemons it is.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/u0fkup/so_i_ate_an_orange_in_the_shower_the_other_day/", "created_utc": 1649589618.0, "score": 83, "author": "Vyr66", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/u0fkup/so_i_ate_an_orange_in_the_shower_the_other_day/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["The last line hits like a slap in the face", "The way you live gives me anxiety.

Means you have to fight to peel it and an exhausting peeling session is not the aim of a shower orange. If you go for a smaller orange like a cutie or a clementine, then the world opens up to you because you don\u2019t have a thick rind to fight through. \n\nYou have to bite the orange. This is essential, I cannot emphasize this enough. Eating it with your hands, picking the slices apart, that is the absolute antithesis of what we do here. A shower orange is meant to be bitten into like a wild animal delivering a killing chomp on its prey. You are the master of the orange. You peel or don\u2019t (whatever your preference) and then, while the orange is still intact, you BITE THAT SHIT. You have to bite into it, the rules of slices do NOT apply in the shower. You\u2019ll never catch an OG SO-er eating by slices or chunks. Round these parts we bite. \n\nThe whole point of a shower orange, what makes an SO different from a regular O, is the savagery. Do you know what I mean? Because you\u2019re in a steady stream of water, you don\u2019t have to worry about being clean, and there\u2019s a tremendous freedom in that. You can let juice run down your chin and onto your chest because the water cleanses you constantly. It\u2019s a beautiful thing. Lean into that. \n\nSome other cool sensory tidbits to pay attention to: \n\n1) Temperature: Hot shower + cold orange is life changing. \n\n2) Squirting juice: let it splash on the walls, all over the floor, all over you. Hell see how far you can get juice to go if you want to make a game of it \ud83d\ude02 \n\n3) Shedding the peel: you can peel that shit and drop it right on the floor. GODDAMN does that feel good. \n\n4) Aroma: as you peel, or if you pre-roll your orange on the wall for juiciness, essential oils come out and flavor up your shower steam for a gift that keeps on giving over the course of the shower.\n\n5) Close your eyes on your first bite. Focus on as many of the above as you can. Immerse yourself in the experience and seek the happiness in it. \n\n\nYOU GOT THIS OP, GIVE IT A SECOND TRY.", "Lmaoo", "Turn off the lights, forget the clout, forget everything.

Set the scene with lights off, fan on, some chill tunes and a hot shower. It's the afternoon here and I felt like I needed a reset to finish the rest of my day doing something productive.\n\nOrange itself: navel orange, softball sized. I hate the little inverted orange butt chunk these have at one end, I will choose a different variety next time. However, orange was chilled to 38\u00b0 F before hand so the extra cold juice added an interesting sensory experience. Also a very good orange flavor wise. 8/10\n\nEmotions while shower orange: At first I was pretty relaxed but soon felt somewhat overwhelmed with all the sounds. Will go without music next time. Again, the other senses (taste/smell, touch, sight) were pretty satisfied by the citrus juices, hot water, and low light. I normally eat oranges slowly wedge by wedge as I find repetitive tasks to be meditative. I ate the orange way too fast and could have savored it more. It was a pleasantly feral feeling to be clutching my big ass orange and munching on it with my eyes closed. Primate vibes. 7/10\n\nEmotions post shower orange: I am glad that I peeled my orange first, I would not want to pick up those little white pieces afterwards. I feel energized yet relaxed, ready to work on some projects for the rest of the evening. 9/10\n\nOverall score: 8/10.

It was way too ripe and sweet, right on the edge of fermentation, so next time I will get a nice Fresh and sour orange.\nSo I got in the shower with my orange and turned the water to 40\u00b0 C and got to the peeling. First there was the smell, the smell of the orange peel squirting it's aromatic oils in the air as I remove it, it smelled great. As I said the taste was not ideal but non the less good. The feeling of biting into an orange like it's an apple and having the juices run down your chin is very pleasant! I would also squish the orange peel from time to time to get the orange smell to fill the air while taking another bite. It felt like what I was doing wasn't just me eating an orange in a shower because some people on the internet said it was nice, it felt almost like a meditative exercise. Nothing but the taste, smell, feel of an orange and hot water running down your body while breathing in the moist heavy air. Very relaxing!
